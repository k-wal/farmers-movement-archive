The airline also announced that passengers will be able to make unlimited changes for new bookings made till April 30 on regular fares under this offer. IndiGo is the second airline after SpiceJet to introduce such a waiver. “There is no change in the cancellation fee, and that will be chargeable,” the airline spokesperson said. Sanjay Kumar, chief strategy and revenue officer, IndiGo, said, “This offer is in line with our philosophy of providing our customers a hassle-free experience, and giving them much-needed flexibility, especially in these times.” SpiceJet was the first airline to introduce such an offer. On March 31, in order to make passengers feel safe and not suffer due to the unprecedented situation, SpiceJet introduced the offer where passengers booked direct domestic flight tickets from March 27 to April 4 were eligible for a one-time waiver on the change fee for the travel period between March 27 and June 30. However, the airline had clarified that fare the difference between two places (in case of sector change) will be applicable for flight changes and the customer will have to pay the additional amount, if required, and that in case the fare of the changed sector is lesser than the original sector booked, the difference will be refunded to the passengers. “Passengers will be able to avail the waiver of change fee only for one time. In case the flight is changed by passengers for the second time, change fee will be applicable as per standard terms,” SpiceJet had said. The airline specified that the ‘zero change fee’ offer cannot be clubbed with any other scheme, offer, discount or promotion. It also said that the offer is valid on bookings made via all channels including SpiceJet’s website, mobiles, reservations (call centre), airport ticketing counter and online travel agents.“However, fare difference for flight changes and facilitation fee will be applicable for flight change requested through reservations (airline call centre) or airport ticketing counters,” SpiceJet had said.

The fresh instructions come from the varsity authorities although the hostels of AU or the trusts were officially closed since August last year many inmates are forcefully occupying their rooms. AU authorities had made several attempts to free these rooms from the ‘forceful occupants’ including levying a fine of up to five times the amount of hostel fee of their stay, but all attempts failed to deter these inmates. Now, the vice-chancellor, through a letter issued by assistant registrar DK Goswami has once again asked dean student welfare (DSW) to ensure that the hostel rooms are vacated, and inmates are asked to go back to their homes for their safety. The letter mentions, in Uttar Pradesh, Covid cases are continuously rising day by day and the Government of Uttar Pradesh has enforced disaster management act across the state. In the interest of the students, it is required that all students should vacate the hostels and return to their homes. Further, all classes are being run in online mode and thus student should stay at home for their safety.The DSW has been asked by the VC to take necessary action in this regard and an action taken report has to be submitted to the VC. Interestingly, the letter of the assistant registrar, which was shared by the assistant public relation officer of AU with the media, also mentions the fact that the hostels of AU could be converted into Covid wards if needed. It mentions, “It is also a fact that hospitals are facing crises and hostels will be converted in the Covid wards.”This holds ground as the city is witnessing an acute shortage of beds in different hospitals for patients infected with the coronavirus.

But before we could understand what had happened, the entire premises of the godown was on fire as cylinders kept exploding and metal pieces flying across,” said Rajesh Jaiswal, a resident of Sant Ghat. “The explosion was heard about a kilometre away,” said another villager in Bairiya block. For about 45 minutes, the gas godown resembled a fireball, threatening to spread in the nearby area where a petrol pump is located barely 200 metres away. It took the fire brigade about an hour to douse the blaze with help of eight fire tenders, three of which brought from neighbouring East Champaran. Later, Kundan Kumar, district magistrate (DM) of West Champaran, said, “No causalities were reported in the incident.”Nandkishore Choudhary, the owner of the gas agency, put the damages caused at over ₹50 lakh. “Besides, about 24 vehicles and about 300 cylinders are missing or damaged in the incident. The fire has also caused extensive damages to the godown’s roof and boundary wall,” Choudhary said. “In all, 12 delivery vans, 10 others carriers and two motorcycles were found to be completely gutted in the course of our preliminary investigation,” said Dhushyant Kumar, station house officer (SHO), Bairiya police station. “The exact cause of the fire could not be known immediately. We are trying to ascertain the same,” said Vidhyanath Paswan, subdivisional magistrate (SDM), Bettiah.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bettiah-24-vehicles-gutted-in-fire-at-gas-godown-101618591455674.html
16-04-2021||Delhi||PIL in Delhi HC seeks to establish NRI Commission at national level||A public interest litigation (PIL) was filed in the Delhi High Court on Friday seeking to establish a Non-Resident Indians Commission (NRI Commission) at the national level to address the concerns of Indians living outside the country.The PIL was filed by Anisur Rehman through advocate Jose Abraham. Rehman claimed that he is an NRI currently working in Sultanate of Oman, and is well aware of the challenges faced by the NRI community on foreign land as well as in the home country.Rehman, in his PIL, said he wants to protect the fundamental right of NRIs guaranteed under the Constitution of India and has therefore urged the court to issue direction to the Centre to consider his representation and take appropriate action on the same.He said that there are millions of Indian expatriates who are living in labour camps and other deplorable areas for better lives for their families in India."The NRIs are a section which makes a pivotal contribution in the development of the nation. The NRI community has always seen at the forefront to help the country in times of crisis caused by internal issues or calamities. The most recent example is the wholehearted support extended by the Indian expatriates especially in GCC countries during the havoc caused by floods in southern India," the plea said.The advocate said that NRIs are seen as a vulnerable section in these times when the Covid-19 pandemic is spreading at a rapid pace."The Indian expatriates also face exploitation and breach of contract in many countries. Indians are also languishing in foreign prisons under false and fabricated charges. Many Indian women are physically and mentally exploited either by their employer or many times by even their own husbands," read the petition."The issues of concern to the NRIs are varied in nature. The NRIs have to face immense difficulties in India as well. In recent times, one often gets to hear of reports of difficulties faced by NRIs to start an enterprise in India," it said.It further stated that the union and state governments have always assured the NRI organisations of fullest support with initiatives focusing on the NRIs undertaken from time to time.The petitioner apprised the court that so far only three state governments--Punjab, Kerala and Goa have constituted an NRI Commission.The petitioner submitted that an NRI commission at the national level is the need of the hour and the need for it has become dire in the current pandemic situation.He said that Covid-19 has caused immense hardships to the Indian NRI community. It is estimated that lakhs of Indians have lost their source of employment or are on the verge of losing their jobs, the plea claimed.Rehman said that the present situation has also increased the need for a National NRI commission on the lines of the proposed Commission for Migrant Labours.The petitioner said that a national level commission will help in streamlining all the NRI related welfare schemes at one platform and in safeguarding the interest of the expatriates in a more efficacious and effective manner.The Delhi High Court will hear the petition on April 22.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/pil-in-delhi-hc-seeks-to-establish-nri-commission-at-national-level-101618590826937.html
16-04-2021||Patna||School teachers’ recruitment: Online monitor on cards for fair play||With the past appointment of school teachers done through panchayati raj institutions (PRIs) and urban local bodies since 2006 landing in court due to controversies surrounding them, Bihar’s education department is now working on a mechanism to ensure centralized monitoring of all future recruitments. Education minister Vijay Kumar Choudhary said the objective behind decentralizing the recruitment process was to vest more responsibility in the democratically elected PRIs and urban local bodies, but due to complaints about irregularities the matters landed in court. “Now, the effort is to monitor the recruitment process online through a system located centrally in Patna without diluting the role of PRIs and urban local bodies a wee bit. This is only to usher in greater transparency and accountability. We have to recruit another 1.25 lakh teachers and as soon as we get the nod of the court, we will start it,” he said. The minister said that there was no point making recruitment in one year and then dealing with litigations for the next 10 years. “We are developing an online process so that the candidates could have a fair idea of every stage – right from the time they apply to the making of the merit list and issue of appointment letters by the recruiting agencies at the level of PRIs and urban local bodies,” he said. The move is significant as the Bihar’s Vigilance Investigation Bureau (VIB), probing the suspected appointment of teachers on forged document on the orders of the Patna High Court since 2015, is still unable to complete the exercise due to education department’s inability to make available nearly one lakh missing folders, as cooperation from PRIs, many of which underwent change of guard in the last 15 years, was found lacking.With the court expressing displeasure over the delay, the government recently came up with an alternative mechanism and fixed the accountability on teachers to get their documents verified by uploading them afresh. The teachers have to upload the certificate for minimum eligibility required for their recruitment, along with their marksheets submitted along with the application and the recruitment letter on a web portal designed for the purpose. In the fresh recruitment of around 94,000 primary teachers, the department has, learning from the past, decided to tread cautiously. All the documents will be verified before issuing appointment letters. For the new exercise also, all documents will have to be uploaded on the portal. The minister said the government was also ready to go ahead with the new recruitment process for teachers fully enforcing the reservation roster formula. The court had earlier stopped the recruitment process following allegations that reservation roster was not being followed. The hearing in the case is due. “The government will guarantee adherence to the reservation roster in letter and spirit. The government wants to give benefits to all the categories. We have to hire around 91,000 teachers in elementary schools and 30,000-plus in secondary and higher schools. As soon as we get the go-ahead from the court, the process will start. We will assure court there will be no deviation from the roster,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/school-teachers-recruitment-online-monitor-on-cards-for-fair-play-101618591335616.html

At Sahyog Hospital in Patliputra Colony, for instance, the demand has doubled from 20 cylinders to 40 cylinders per day. Unable to meet the excess demand, the hospital was refusing to admit Covid-19 patients who require oxygen up to 12-15 litres per minute, said a hospital source.Sai Hospital and Satyavrat Hospital in Kankerbagh were also facing shortage of oxygen cylinders.Principal secretary (health) Pratyaya Amrit conceded there was shortage over the last two days and said efforts were on to streamline supply in the next two days. “We have asked two major suppliers, Linde India and Inox Air Products Ltd, to supply medical oxygen on a daily basis instead of alternate days, as is the case now,” he said.“Two oxygen generation plants, with a capacity of 250 litres oxygen per minute, are operational at the Patna Medical College Hospital (PMCH) and the Nalanda Medical College Hospital (NMCH) while those at seven other state-run medical college hospitals will be functional in a week or 10 days, said Amrit.Bihar has to essentially rely on West Bengal and Jharkhand for supply of medical oxygen.In Muzaffarpur, which recorded 265 positive cases on Thursday, oxygen supply failed miserably to meet the demand.Rambabu, an operator in a company engaged in oxygen production and refilling, said the demand for small oxygen cylinders had gone up by 10 times while demand for big cylinders had increased by three to five times. “Earlier, we used to supply 50 to 60 big cylinders every day. Now, we have to supply 180-200 cylinders daily,” he said.Another supplier Suresh Kumar said his agency had received a demand of 23 to 25 small cylinders, which has now gone up to 35 to 45 daily.Officials agreed that the demand had gone up, but said there was no shortage. “There is no reported case of shortage at health centres,” said Dr Vikas Kumar, principal of Sri Krishna Medical College and Hospital (SKMCH). “We are using piped system for supply of oxygen. We are also getting 250 big cylinders through outsourcing,” he said.Civil surgeon Dr SK Chaudhury also dismissed reports of shortage.In Seemanchal, officials said there was no shortage of oxygen cylinders but expressed fears in case the number of patients increases rapidly. Purnia civil surgeon Dr S K Verma said “There is no shortage of oxygen cylinders in the district till now and we are ready to deal with any situation.” “In Kishanganj, there is no critical Covid patient and there is no dearth of oxygen cylinders. The 281 people tested positive for Covid-19 are getting treatment in home isolation,” Kishanganj civil surgeon Dr Shrinanandan said. “There is no dearth of oxygen cylinders.”Araria civil surgeon Dr M P Gupta said “There are five patients undergoing treatment in Araria. They all are at a Covid designated hospital at Forbesganj. There is no shortage of oxygen cylinders and beds in the district now.” In Bhabua, Oxygen cylinders were available in sufficient numbers and there was no shortage, additional chief medical officer, Dr KN Tiwary said.There were 10 ventilator machines available in the district, but these were not operational in the absence of experts, officials said.Oxygen shortage was not reported from any part of West and East Champaran district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bihar-hospitals-gasp-for-oxygen-cylinders-101618591215644.html

The district administration has been writing to the state government to increase testing capacity in the city which has been reporting the highest number of new Covid cases in the country.While most commercial laboratories have ensured that the reports are made available to the people within 24 to 36 hours, most hospitals have either stopped or prioritized sample collection.Dr HK Sake, executive director at Noble Hospital, said, “We have stopped collecting samples for now because we have an overload of work. Our staff is exhausted with treating patients at the OPD and those admitted. We have samples lined up on our corridors and so we have stopped collection as of now.”Abrarali Dalal, chief operating officer (COO) Sahyadri Hospitals, said, “We have not stopped collection, but we have prioritized it. We do not collect samples for those who need it for work or travel purpose, but ensure that the staff is used optimally and so we attend to hospitalised patients or those at home with symptoms.”Major laboratories in the city still face a shortage of manpower which is delaying reporting. Pallavi Jain, managing director at Krsnaa, said, “We ensure that all our reports are presented within 36 hours and the delay is because of the staff shortage as most of them have been infected. Also, we have to ensure that every sample is reported with all the contact details as described by the PMC.” However, delayed reports are hampering the further contact tracing work which is crucial to break the chain of infection and stop the spread.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pune-residents-face-inconvenience-due-to-delay-in-rt-pcr-test-reports-101618586595372.html

If we consider a 10-12 per cent shortage, Maharashtra will continue to face a shortage of 12,000 to 15,000 Remdesivir vials for the next two to three days.”Blaming companies for delay in supply of the much sough-after Covid-19 drug, the FDA minister said, “The heads of Remdesivir-making companies had 15 days back assured me to supply around 55,000 vials of the injection. However, till April 15 these companies could provide only 37,000 to 39,000 vials to the state.”“I held a video conference meeting with the CEOs and MDs of some of the companies that produce Remdesivir today again. These companies have now assured me that supply will be streamlined April 19 onwards,” he said.He lauded the Centre's move to ban the export of Remdesivir."Ready stocks of Remdesivir (which were bound for shipments abroad) are available even in Maharashtra. Some of the company representatives met me with a proposal of allowing these stocks to be sold in Maharashtra,” Shingane said."Maharashtra chief minster Uddhav Thackeray has also issued orders allowing export-bound stocks to be sold in the state (following the ban). I do not know how much such vials are available (with companies)," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-to-face-shortage-of-remdesivir-for-next-2-to-3-days-says-minister-rajendra-shingane-101618575248056.html
16-04-2021||Mumbai||Malavika’s Mumbaistan: An Ode to Doctors||“Not all heroes wear capes. In the midst of the novel coronavirus pandemic, the real heroes wear scrubs.” It was a modest clinic, housed on the ground floor of an unprepossessing one-storey structure, consisting of a tiny reception area which led to a larger room, divided into three austere examination rooms by plywood partitions and flanked by a dimly lit space, where the compounder sat, behind a small window. The husband-and-wife doctor couple who ran this modest medical centre, right below their own home, did not even have a demarcated space for themselves to meet patients, but shuffled constantly in and out of the examination rooms, as and when required. Those were the days of innocence; of leading robust and unencumbered lives, when we were encouraged to adopt pursuits and practices that would give today’s woke, politically correct Google-informed and germ-obsessed parents a million nightmares. Blithely ignorant of any consequences, we wolfed down calorie-loaded white breads and sugary desserts, untouched by screens and blocks, we played all day under the hot sun; unmindful of hygiene and germs, we ate off the streets, drank water straight from taps, guzzled instant coffee twice a day (because it made the milk taste better) and ran around barefoot and free in the playing fields of our youth, with not a thought of contagions and accidents, or bugs and microbes. And when all this caught up with us, we were duly dragged off to the friendly neighbourhood family doctor, who after a predictable routine of knocking on our tummies, having us stick out our tongues, examining our torsos with his stethoscope and feeling our foreheads for fever, would give us a little scrap of illegible paper, which we were to hand over to the compounder, ever ready in his dimly-lit cave, to pound and pulverise the vilest potions he could lay his hands on, to punish us back to good health. Today, as doctors and other medical professionals are at the very forefront of the planet’s epic battle against the coronavirus pandemic, where their expertise and prowess have been called into action so urgently to save humanity, I can’t help but think of the sea of change in recognising the significance that doctors play in our lives. Today, it is to our doctors and medical fraternity that the world turns, for hope and deliverance. And it is to their eternal credit — throwing caution and thoughts of their own personal safety to the winds, it is our doctors who have risen to this generational unprecedented challenge facing humanity. “Wherever the art of medicine is loved, there is also a love of Humanity,” said Hippocrates, and to be sure, Mumbai has had a rich history of humane, empathetic, and compassionate doctors — internationally renowned gynaecologists, celebrated surgeons, acclaimed oncologists, distinguished psychiatrists and eminent general practitioners who have graced this city and left lasting memories as their legacies. Indeed, over the years, Mumbai’s doctors have earned for themselves an illustrious reputation and much renown. Doctors who have gone above and beyond the call of their duty to attend to the elderly and ailing; doctors who have set aside their own personal ambitions to work tirelessly in public hospitals and centres, where the rewards and recognition are way below their pay grade; and doctors who even as they practiced the highest rigors of professionalism and principles, have not forsaken their humour and kindness. Which is why, today when we hear of the critical exhaustion that doctors and medical professionals are experiencing and when we see photographs of doctors curled up like sardines in makeshift cupboards or corridors and doorways catching a few moments of sleep in between emergencies, their faces scarred by the constant wearing of masks, it is paramount that we never forget that they too are human. In March, Dr Rajesh Parikh, neuropsychiatrist and director of medical research at Jaslok Hospital and Research Centre, one of the city’s most celebrated medical professionals with over 150 publications in journals such as Lancet, American Journal of Psychiatry, and internationally renowned as much for his erudition as his wit, posted a few heartfelt lines on a social media platform alluding to his experience of “signs of early depression”. “A public admission of my early symptoms of depression. Hope to avoid it with yoga, mindfulness and exercise. Otherwise, will need counselling and/or meds. With so many bright colleagues to choose from, am not at all worried for myself,” the post had read. As expected, the effect it had on his legion of friends, patients and admirers was seismic. After all, Parikh had been one of the first crusaders against the scourge of the pandemic and a familiar, almost daily presence on prime TV as an authority on the virus. As early as December 2019, while on a trip to the Sunderbans, he had been keenly following news of the strange new disease taking lives in Wuhan. “I anticipated the havoc that the virus would bring to our country and the rest of the world, and began work on a protocol for Jaslok which, at the insistence of my lovely publisher Milee Aishwarya of Penguin Random House, mutated into a national bestseller.” “The Coronavirus: What you Need to Know about the Global Pandemic” was the first book in the world on the pandemic and was launched to a global audience of 25,000, a record of sorts for a book launch. On the heels of this book, Parikh had burnt the midnight oil to bring out “The Vaccination Book” — a comprehensive tome on every aspect of the subject. The fact that a man as knowledgeable in not only the vagaries of the disease but also the inner workings of the mind could succumb to the exhaustion and sense of defeat was not lost on anyone. “Physician, heal thyself” was the universal response. We see doctors as being invincible and superhuman. “In nothing do men more nearly approach the gods than in giving health to men,” said Marcus Tullius Cicero. And yes, they are gods who help and heal, repair and remedy, soothe and settle, but beneath all that brilliance and cognition it is easy to forget that they are all too human, eminently so. Fortunately, thanks to the groundswell of support and harnessing his inner resources as well as yoga and mindfulness and talking to his wife, the eminent Dr Firuza Parikh, Parikh had bounced back in two days. But he continues to acknowledge with humility the vulnerability of all, especially experts on the pandemic and mental health. “We are in for another major pandemic of a mental health crisis, but I am confident that as a species we shall harness our collective resources to overcome it. And to quote Abraham Lincoln — “This too shall pass”,” he says. So even as the battle to defeat the pandemic continues, let us never forget that our doctors are some of our most precious resources and that they, even the most accomplished and impassioned and erudite among them, are human too and as vulnerable to fatigue and frustration and exhaustion as the rest of us, during these unprecedented and harrowing times.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/malavikas-mumbaistan-an-ode-to-doctors-101618578675877.html
16-04-2021||Chandigarh||Charges framed against Hooda by special CBI court in AJL plot re-allotment case||A special court on Friday framed charges against former Haryana chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda in the alleged illegal allotment of a plot in Panchkula to Associated Journal Limited (AJL), the publisher of National Herald newspaper. The trial court acted on the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) chargesheet filed in December 2018. CBI special judge Sushil Kumar Garg ordered the framing of charges under Section 120-B (criminal conspiracy) and 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act against Hooda. Hooda was present in the court when charges were framed. Also read: Randeep Surjewala, Harsimrat Badal test positive for Covid-19The detailed order is awaited. Congress leader Motilal Vora, who died in December 2020, too was an accused in the case. Another accused arrayed was the firm, AJL. At the time of registering the FIR in 2016, Vora was the chairman of AJL and Congress president Sonia Gandhi and her son Rahul Gandhi were among the shareholders. The newspaper was launched in 1938 by Jawaharlal Nehru, the first prime minister. Hooda misused his position to favour AJL: Probe An institutional plot, C-17 spread over 3,360 square metres in Sector 6, Panchkula, was allotted by Haryana Urban Development Authority (HUDA) to AJL in 1982, but because the construction was not carried in 10 years, it was taken back in 1992. In 1995 and in 1996, appeal and revisions were filed by AJL against resumption of the plot, but these were also dismissed by the HUDA administrator and Haryana’s financial commissioner, Town and Country Planning. However, when Hooda became the chief minister in 2005, he allowed the re-allotment of the plot to AJL, according to the CBI. The CBI claimed that Hooda, who was also the HUDA chairman, “blatantly misused his official position and dishonestly allotted the plot afresh in the guise of re-allotment to AJL at original rates plus interest in violation of the HUDA policy vide an order on August 28, 2005. Thus, he caused wrongful loss to HUDA and wrongful gain to AJL.” In December 2018, the CBI had filed a chargesheet against Hooda, Vora and AJL. An Enforcement Directorate probe is also underway in the case. On May 5, 2016, the FIR was registered by the Haryana vigilance bureau regarding allegations of cheating and corruption against Hooda and others. In December 2016, the Haryana government recommended the CBI probe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/charges-framed-against-hooda-by-special-cbi-court-in-ajl-plot-re-allotment-case-101618574297163.html
16-04-2021||Pune||Slam dunk: Staying on in the off-season is key to NBA success||In preparation for a professional basketball season, a substantial portion of a comprehensive training programme will incorporate focus on physical training. With a professional basketball season in the NBA being approximately 80 – 100 games each season, over eight months, this usually leaves an athlete a window of three-four months in the offseason to prepare themselves for the rigors of the competitive season. What are the primary components of offseason basketball training? How does it differ from physical training for basketball during the season? The first objective of offseason basketball training in a professional league as competitive and long as the NBA is for players to rest from the mental and physical fatigue of the season. While different athletes have a large variation in the amount of rest time they need to recuperate from the demands of the season, the usual duration of this is from one-four weeks. During this time, athletes will not engage in any rigorous physical activity, due primarily to the fact that athletes in season are in a constant state of nervous system fatigue. To reach a steady physical state of not being “overtrained” this period of down time is essential for the majority of athletes who have not yet developed the resistance to fatigue that gets built up over many years of playing in the NBA schedule. After this brief rest period, an athlete will usually focus exclusively on rebuilding their body physically in the initial part of the off-season. This could involve a few weeks and sessions of cross-training such as swimming, biking, boxing, running on the track, martial arts or yoga. The purpose of this training is to reintroduce a gradual physical load to the body. Additionally, it keeps athletes learning various movements that are general and not specific to basketball. This allows for less risk on overuse injuries from all the repetitive motions due to basketball. General weightlifting exercises are also reintroduced to the training programme at this time, as well as an increased focus on flexibility and balance. After a few weeks of cross-training, athletes will dive into the main part of their offseason programme. They might pick a select number of technical skills that they want to improve at in basketball games and work on those skills in an isolated setting, improving their confidence in those skills before trying to apply them to game situations. From a physical standpoint, athletes will use this six-week period to build up their body physically with a focus on increasing lean muscle mass, maximum strength levels and also doing the relevant amount of flexibility work necessary to improve their positioning and movement on the basketball court. By this time period, there is usually about three-four weeks left till the start of basketball training camp and the season again. The focus shifts from building up the body to fine tuning all of the basketball skills in a setting that requires more game action. An athlete will likely have improved confidence from honing their technical skills, now transfers over as the athlete re-introduces their body to the decision-making and physical qualities required to implement those newly learned skills into an actual an game. The focus on weight training may dial back considerably, but will still be maintained consistently in preparation for training camp to ensure athlete strength levels are high. By planning out the offseason in this cyclical fashion, an athlete can ensure that they are entering the competitive season and training camp in peak physical condition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/slam-dunk-staying-on-in-the-off-season-is-key-to-nba-success-101618574295987.html
16-04-2021||Chandigarh||Sidhu takes on Capt Amarinder govt, says cheated people on sacrilege, drug probes||Taking a swipe at the Capt Amarinder Singh-led ministry in Punjab, former minister Navjot Singh Sidhu on Friday said the Congress government had cheated the people who voted it to power on the assurance that it would bring those guilty of the 2015 sacrilege incidents and drug cases to book. Addressing a press conference in Patiala, Sidhu said: “The government was formed on the promise of punishing the guilty of sacrilege and those involved in the drug cases, but it failed on both fronts. The public feels cheated as the government didn’t kept its promise.” Questioning the working of the Capt Amarinder Singh government, he blamed botched-up investigations for the delay in nailing the guilty. Sidhu, who visited Kotkapura that was the epicentre of the sacrilege incidents and subsequent protests on Baisakhi, demanded that the Punjab government make the reports of the special investigation team (SIT) probing the 2015 incidents public. He also sought the release of the report on drug cases compiled by special task force chief Harpreet Sidhu. “In Punjab, the SIT means SITDOWN. No SIT has yielded any result so far,” he said. On the drug cases, he said that Harpreet Sidhu’s report was handed over to the government by the court for taking action. “The file has been sent to the government through the advocate general to act against the guilty. Why has no action been taken so far? ” he said. He said if the government does not believe the STF report, it should probe the statements of drug lord Jagdish Bhola and others, who are on record to say that they were only pawns. “Why have the big names involved in the drug racket not been exposed?” he said. On the sacrilege issue, Sidhu said that the investigation was botched up since 2015. “Why has the government failed to name and nail the guilty? On whose directions did the policemen open fire on protesters? Why are their names not mentioned in the FIR? It’s evident from the Justice Ranjit Singh Commission report that the then chief minister had spoken to the then police chief at midnight, hours before the firing on protesting Sikhs was undertaken. The report was tabled in the House, debated and a resolution was passed to punish the guilty, but no concrete action has been taken. Who is responsible?” he said, asking the government to make the report of the sacrilege probe public. On his course of action, Sidhu said he has started by raising issues. “Sacrilege is the most important issue for me and I will not sit until the guilty are punished,” he said. He urged the government to make the SIT report public. “Everyone knows who is guilty for the sacrilege and firing on Sikhs besides the drugs problem of Punjab, but why has the government failed to act?” he said, adding: “The public is angry with the government.” Sidhu declined comment on the resignation of inspector general of police Kunwar Vijay Pratap Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sidhu-takes-on-capt-amarinder-govt-says-cheated-people-on-sacrilege-drug-probes-101618572975538.html

Officials in the know said the EC has assured the state poll panel that it will provide EVMs ( models that are used in assembly and parliamentary polls) based on availability of the voting machines , a proposition to which the SEC is now open. “We have discussed the option of using EVMs used by EC in assembly and general polls. It is a viable option and we will now work on it.The talks have been positive and we feel the panchayat polls will now be conducted at the earliest through EVMs,” said secretary, SEC, Yogendra Ram. Also Read | Caste a factor in 21 of 45 seats in Bengal’s fifth phase polling on SaturdayAccording to officials in the know, EC and SEC representatives discussed procuring multi-post EVM model B-3 SSDM from the ECIL( Electronic Corporation of India Limited), Bengaluru. But the proposition was not found feasible as the ECIL expressed its inability to provide 15,000 multi-post EVMs of B-3 model in a short time. “ECIL has communicated that it would take at least several months to provide EVMs as per specifications by SEC . That would inordinately delay the panchayat polls. This is why, we feel it is feasible to use general EVMs that would be made available by EC,” said a senior SEC functionary. SEC officials said the state poll panel would now work on the new plan of holding the panchayat polls through EVMs provided by EC. Needless to say, the task of holding the polls through simple EVMs is said to be more challenging given that each polling station would require at least six EVMs for six posts. That way a few hundred thousand EVMs would be required. “There are logistics involved. All these points will be put before the Commission,” the functionary added. Admittedly, the decks have now been cleared for early panchayat polls . The SEC had filed a writ petition in the Patna high court in February seeking judicial remedy over the EC’s reluctant stand in giving permission to ECIL, Bengaluru to provide multi-post EVMs. The court , during its last two hearings, had ordered both the poll panels to settle the matter amicably; however, the case is still pending.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/sec-ec-resolve-dispute-over-evms-early-panchayat-polls-on-cards-in-bihar-101618569976093.html

This is only to usher in greater transparency and accountability. We have to recruit another 1.25 lakh teachers and as soon as we get the nod of the court, we will start it,” Choudhary stated.The past appointment of school teachers was done through the panchayati raj institutions (PRIs) and urban local bodies but several controversies were surrounding them. The minister said the objective of the Nitish Kumar government behind decentralising the recruitment process was to vest more responsibility in the PRIs and urban local bodies but due to complaints about irregularities, the matters landed in court. The minister said that there was no point in making recruitment one year and then dealing with the litigations and court cases for the next 10 years. “We are developing an online process so that the candidates could have a fair idea of every stage – right from the time they apply to the making of the merit list and issue of appointment letters by the recruiting agencies at the level of PRIs and urban local bodies,” he added. The move is significant as the Bihar’s Vigilance Investigation Bureau (VIB), which is probing the suspected appointment of teachers on forged document by the order of the Patna High Court since 2015, is still unable to complete the exercise due to the education department’s inability to make available nearly one-lakh missing folders. Cooperation from PRIs, many of which underwent change of guard in the last 15 years, was found lacking. With the court expressing displeasure over the delay, the government recently came up with an alternative mechanism and fixed the accountability on teachers to get their documents verified by uploading them afresh. The teachers have to upload the certificate for minimum eligibility required for their recruitment, their mark sheets along with the application and the recruitment letter on a web portal designed for the purpose. In the fresh recruitment of around 94,000 primary teachers, the department has, learning from the past, decided to tread cautiously. All the documents will be verified before issuing appointment letters. For the new exercise also, all documents will have to be uploaded on the portal. The minister said the government was also ready to go ahead with the new recruitment process for teachers fully enforcing the reservation roster formula. The court had earlier stopped the recruitment process following allegations that the reservation roster was not being followed. The hearing in the case is due. “The government will guarantee adherence to the reservation roster in letter and spirit. The government wants to give benefits to all the categories. We have to carry out around 91,000 recruitments in elementary schools and 30,000 plus in secondary and higher schools. As soon as we get the go-ahead from the court, the process will be on. We will assure the court that there will be no deviation from the roster,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bihar-mulls-centralised-vigil-of-school-teachers-recruitment-for-greater-transparency-101618566855829.html

Due to the intermittent supply of COVID vaccines, the sessions for immunisation cannot be conducted as planned,” Odisha health and family welfare minister Naba Das said in his letter to the Centre. Das had earlier written two more letters to Union health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan requesting more supply of vaccines.Das, in a letter to Dr Harsha Vardhan, said the state is prepared to administer 3 lakh doses daily but about 2-3 lakh vaccine shots are being allocated to it at a time.Das said the state has received 50,79,650 doses of Covid-19 vaccines as of April 14 of which 48.15 lakh doses have been used. Though the state administered 2.71 lakh doses on April 3, its highest so far, the vaccination has been erratic due to the intermittent supply of vaccines. In the last 7 days beginning April 9, the vaccination has hovered between 66,787 and 1.98 lakh, he said.The state is likely to receive another consignment of 3 lakh doses of vaccines on Friday.The state government’s concern over erratic Covid-19 supply came even as Odisha registered its highest single-day Covid-19 cases of 3,108 on Friday. Three more deaths were reported.The Test Positivity Rate (TPR) climbed to 9.7 per cent while the R0 (R-naught) value stood at 2.14. R-naught, also called the R-factor, stands for the ability of one infected person passing on the disease, on average, to the number of healthy people.Reports suggest that the rate of reproduction of coronavirus infection has reached its peak since March-April 2020 when it was 1.98 in Odisha.Director of health services, Dr Bijoy Mohapatra, said, though the state government is yet to arrive at a mathematical model of the likely number of cases in the next few weeks, he expected the peak to arrive by mid-May.“Considering that the R0 value is now more than 2 and TPR is nearing 9, we are making all efforts to keep the beds ready. Of the 4,198 general Covid beds, around 25 per cent are occupied while 60 per cent of the ICU beds are occupied. Similarly, less than 20 per cent of the ventilators are occupied right now. We are trying to add 40 per cent more beds than what we would need at the time of a peak,” said Mohapatra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/odisha-demands-25-lakh-doses-of-covid-19-vaccine-in-single-lot-over-intermittent-supply-101618555106587.html

16-04-2021||Ranchi||Campaign for Madhupur by-election ends, over 3.22 lakh to vote on April 17||Political parties and candidates made a last-ditch effort to garner people’s support, as campaigning for Madhupur by-election ended on Thursday evening.Even though Madhupur assembly constituency in Santhal Paragana division has traditionally witnessed a direct electoral battle between the JMM and the BJP, four independent candidates are also leaving no stone unturned to score in the by-poll.More than 3.22 lakh electors from the constituency are expected to exercise their franchise on Saturday. A total of 487 polling stations will be in operation on the polling day under heavy deployment of security.State chief electoral officer (CEO) K Ravi Kumar said, “Campaign came to an end at 6 am on Thursday.Polling will be held on Saturday from 7am till 6pm.”As many as six candidates, including Ganga Narayan Singh from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Hafizul Hasan from the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM), Ashok Kumar Thakur (independent), Uttam Kumar Yadav (Independent), Kisan Kumar Bathwal (Independent) and Rajendra Kumar (Independent), are in the poll fray to try their lucks.The Madhupur seat went vacant after demise of the Jharkhand minority welfare minister Haji Hussain Ansari. The serving minister and a four-term legislator from Madhupur in Santhal Pargana division of the state died of heart attack on October 3, a day after recovering from Covid-19 at a private hospital.In a sudden move, chief minister Hemant Soren inducted Ansari’s son, Hafizul Hasan, who is not yet a member of the Jharkhand legislative assembly, as the 10th member of his cabinet. He filed his nomination as JMM candidate for Madhupur by-election. As per the constitutional provisions, a person becomes a member of the assembly within six months of becoming a minister.Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) has put all its effort to ensure win of its candidate. The chief minister himself campaigned for Hasan from April 9 in Madhupur till April 15.“We are hopeful of winning the by-election easily,” the chief minister said.Meanwhile, the BJP has put its confidence in Ganga Narayan Singh, who switched from AJSU party for the seat. “People have made up their minds to make the BJP candidate win this time from Madhupur,” said Koderma parliamentarian Annapurna Devi, who has also been campaigning for the party candidate.For voters, unemployment and growing crime have been the major issue.However, religious issues ruled the election campaign mostly, as the constituency has around 30% Muslim population. Both the JMM and the BJP promised for tribal development in the constituency keeping in mind around 15% tribal population.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/campaign-for-madhupur-by-election-ends-over-3-22-lakh-to-vote-on-april-17-101618553285899.html

16-04-2021||Lucknow||Plans of setting up state NITI Aayog in Uttar Pradesh far from reality||Uttar Pradesh’s grand plan to set up a state-level Niti Aayog to formulate, evaluate and monitor policies hasn’t taken off more than a year after the state’s finance minister Suresh Khanna government made the announcement in his budget speech in February last year. Senior officers of the state planning department remained tight-lipped on the issue. Others, however, assert that process to set up the state’s policy think tank in accordance with the announcement has been initiated, though giving shape to the new body may take some time. “We have held preliminary discussions and will take further action as and when the modalities and the likely organization structure of the proposed State Niti Aayog are finalised,” said a senior officer of the state planning department. Usually, the budgetary announcements are implemented in the same financial year and 2020-2021 ended on March 31, 2021. The state government may have to expedite action at every stage to make the State Niti Aayog a reality in near future. “If the state government made any announcement about setting up of a State Niti Aayog to replace the state planning commission it should have taken early action. The old institution is yet to be scrapped and the new one has not been given shape. Any delay may affect the planning process,” said Yashvir Tyagi, former professor department of economic, Lucknow University. Also read: India’s vaccine supply: States, UTs receive 129,428,360 dosesUttar Pradesh State Niti Aayog was expected to replace the state planning commission set up nearly 50 years ago. The state planning commission lost its relevance after January 1, 2015, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi decided to do away with the Planning Commission of India and set up the National Institution for Transforming India, a policy think tank called the Niti Aayog. The state planning commission was responsible for preparing the annual plans for the state till 2017, the last year of UP’s 12th five year plan. Amid questions over its continuation, the previous government did not take any decision to scrap the state planning body. A change of government in the 2017 assembly elections brought the issue into focus again and questions resurfaced about the relevance of the state planning commission. An announcement about setting up the Uttar Pradesh State Niti Aayog, replacing the state plan panel gave indications about the obvious shifting of focus from working out annual plans and the five year plans to formulate, evaluate and monitor policies. “Yes, there is a need for a body for advisory functions and oversee the planning process. A new body should however be set up on the pattern of the NITI Aayog with experts from different and not become a government body that the state planning commission has turned out to be,” said AK Singh, former director Giri Institute of Development Studies, Lucknow. The state planning commission also works as an apex body for guiding the District Planning Committees set up in every district under the provisions of Article 243 ZD of the Constitution of India. The state government will therefore have to take a call to assign this role to the State Niti Aayog or some other organisation when it gives a final shape to the structure and working of the new body.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/plans-of-setting-up-state-niti-aayog-in-uttar-pradesh-far-from-reality-101618553054110.html

It follows that when an application for Letters of Administration or Succession Certificate is made by a parent and one of the heirs is the natural guardian of the Petitioner, no question arises of having to furnish surety or of justifying surety for the share of a birth minor in an estate,” said justice Patel. The court added that in all matters where a birth parent seeks such letters of administration or succession certificates, the registry is not entitled to demand surety justifying the birth minor’s share in the property or estate in question.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/high-court-rules-not-to-impede-justice-but-to-aid-it-bombay-hc-101618547474032.html

Residents will be allowed to use public transport services on the weekend only if they fall within the ambit of the exemptions during the weekend curbs, similar to the norms in place for the night curfew.“The Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) order does not specifically mention people travelling for a Covid-19 test. But it has been clarified that such people will be considered under the category of patients travelling for medical or health services. They will not need e-passes, but are advised to keep one handy,” a revenue department official said.Residents of Delhi can apply for e-passes by visiting the www.delhi.gov.in website.Officials of the Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC), the Delhi Integrated Multi-Modal Transit System (DIMTS) Limited, which run the 6,600-odd state buses in the city, and the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) said their operations will continue as usual, but entry of passengers will be strictly regulated on the basis of ID cards and e-passes during the weekend curfew.“Inter-state travel by road will be allowed only for those under the exempted category during the weekend curfew as well as the night curfew that is already in place,” said the official.However, several residents said they buy tickets at railway stations or bus terminals, and will not be able to produce documents if stopped.“Most of us buy tickets at the ISBT. How will we produce the ticket when we are on our way to the ISBT?,” asked Ravi Kumar, a migrant worker who said he wants to travel Bulandshahr in Uttar Pradesh for his nephew’s wedding.A second government official said, “The idea of the weekend curfew is to break the chain of transmission. The message to people through this measure is that they should stay where they are and not move. However, if it is an emergency, then the person might be allowed to go without the bus ticket on the merit of his claims.”A transport department official in the Capital said taxis and autorickshaws will ply as usual during the weekend curfew, but operators and drivers will either need to produce relevant ID cards or e-passes.“In general, there will be fewer cabs and autos because demand will reduce as most people will stay indoors. The Delhi police and enforcement officers from the district magistrate’s offices will do random checks on the roads. Hence, it is better to avoid venturing out during the weekend unless it is a health emergency,” said the transport official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/travel-to-airports-isbts-stns-allowed-e-passes-must-for-vaccination-official-101618539822038.html

16-04-2021||Delhi||Losses vs Covid surge: Gym, mall owners split on latest restrictions||With the government shutting malls, gymnasiums, spas, and auditoriums and a further reduction in the capacity of cinema halls from 50% to 30%, owners of these establishments said they have been dealt a major blow even before they had a chance to recover from the distress of the nationwide lockdown. These curbs come into effect from Friday.While most establishment heads expressed concern over the government’s decision, some said the move was inevitable given the surge in cases.According to the fresh curbs announced by the Delhi government on Thursday, malls, gyms, spas, and auditoriums will be asked to remain shut until further orders. Owners of gyms—among the last to open after last year’s lockdown— said the Delhi government’s decision to close gyms again will hit business.“This is like a lockdown for gyms and it will be a major blow to the industry that has been struggling after the lockdown last year. The industry, in Delhi, has suffered the longest compared to other states. Some of them will be forced to shut shop if the government does not intervene. We are planning to meet the chief minister at the earliest,” said Chirag Sethi, vice-president of Delhi Gyms Association.Gyms across the country were closed after the nationwide lockdown was imposed on March 25 last year to arrest the spread of Covid-19. As the central government allowed states to take calls on reopening of certain sectors one after the other, starting June, several states allowed gyms to reopen by early-August. But Delhi, which witnessed phases of severe surge, allowed gyms to open only by mid-September – which means, the industry was out of work for nearly six months in the Capital.“For six months, we had to incur all fixed costs such as rent, taxes, etc. We also paid salaries to our staff. But there was no revenue. We had to take loans to resume our business in September. The industry is under huge financial burden at this stage. We appeal to the government to rethink its strategies,” said Zoaib Rana, founder of Gravitaz gym in Ashok Vihar.Vinay Sangwan, co-director of Anytime Fitness, a chain of gyms in Delhi-NCR, said: “Gyms have followed a long list of protocols to ensure safety of clients as well as employees. That is the reason why there is no case of gyms turning into hot spots anywhere. There have been no instances of violation of rules either. We understand the risks of the surge in Covid-19 cases but then a blanket ban on gyms should not be seen as the solution.”Mall owners, too, said the closure was coming at a time when malls were only beginning to recover. “After last year’s lockdown, malls had started operations with great difficulty. Just when we were hoping to recover our losses, there is this fresh surge in cases. We understand the government is concerned. Covid is a bigger issue than anything else and we stand with the government. We will comply with all rules, regulations, and guidelines, despite the financial losses that we will have to bear,” said Vineet Parashar, head of operations, V3S mall and V3S East Center Mall, east DelhiUnlike malls and gyms, multiplexes and theatres can operate at a reduced capacity.Devang Sampat, CEO, Cinépolis India, said while they are yet to receive the formal orders detailing the curbs, they would abide by all guidelines. “We will follow all guidelines. Studies have shown theatres to be low-risk environments for the virus spread due to the double-height ceilings and a well-ventilated environment,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/losses-vs-covid-surge-gym-mall-owners-split-on-latest-restrictions-101618539401013.html
16-04-2021||Delhi||Delhi's hospital occupancy now over 10k; test positivity rate shoots past 20%||The Covid-19 test positivity rate in Delhi soared to a 295-day high on Thursday, and breached the 20% mark, on the back of significantly fewer tests in the Capital, as hospitalisations for the infection hit an all-time high in the city, with over 10,000 now occupying Covid-19 beds.The city reported 16,669 new cases on Thursday, a slight decline in the incidence of the viral infection over the previous day, largely due to the drop in testing.As the city’s Covid-19 graph continued to surge, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, after a meeting with Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal, announced more restrictions till April 30, including shutting gyms and malls completely, disallowing dine-in services at restaurants. The government also put in a place curfew over the weekend, starting from 10pm on Friday, till 5am on Monday.On Thursday, 82,569 tests samples were collected, far lower than the average 99,460 daily tests reported over the past seven days, with the test positivity rate at 20.22%, significantly higher than 15.92% logged the previous day, and the highest since 23.28% on June 23 during the first wave of infections.The positivity rate peaked at 15.3% during the third wave in November.The test positivity rate is a vital metric to assess the spread of an infection in a region. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends a rate below 5% for an infection to be considered under control.Delhi’s positivity rate fell below 5% on December 3. It then dropped to below 1% on December 28, and remained lower than that for 82 days.The city also added 112 deaths to its total toll, taking it to 11,652 on Thursday. This is the second day in a row that the city reported over 100 deaths.The city’s single-highest one-day death toll was on November 18, when Delhi added 131 fatalities.On Thursday evening, 10,929 people, were hospitalised with the viral infection, showed the state government’s Delhi Corona app, highlighting the daunting challenge for health care infrastructure in the Capital. The app showed that Delhi has 15,433 beds to treat Covid-19 patients.The number of hospitalisations had peaked at 9,522 during the November surge of cases. There are 15,433 beds earmarked for the treatment of Covid-19 in the city, of which 70.8% were occupied as on Thursday night as per the government’s Delhi Corona app. And, 88% of the 3,811 ICU beds were occupied.“We need to implement stern measures to control the spread of the infection; we are already short on the number of beds. We are heading for a disaster. If today the number of cases increases, the load on the ward and ICU beds will increase in the next five to ten days as it takes that much time for symptoms to worsen and people to reach hospitals,” said Dr GC Khilnani, former head of the department of pulmonology at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS).Experts have said the current increase in cases cannot be attributed solely to mutated variants present in the population and emphasised on the importance of following the rules.“No variant can escape the mask. The rise in the number of cases is sufficient reason to worry. Now is not the time to worry, it would have been before the cases started increasing. What we can do is implement standard public health measures such as minimising indoor mingling, young people staying in. It is not that the virus has mutated to infect younger people, it is the younger people who are out and are getting infected,” said Dr Anurag Agarwal, director of the Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology.In a statement issued on Thursday evening, Kejriwal said two civic body-run hospitals — Hindu Rao and Swami Dayanand Hospital should be declared Covid-only facilities, which will add 900 beds for patients with the viral infection. “There should be full cooperation and no politics on the matter. Delhi government will provide every possible help to the MCD hospitals, including funds,” Kejriwal said.Additionally, the Delhi government has requested the Centre to reserve 2,700 more beds for Covid-19 patients in its hospitals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhis-hospital-occupancy-now-over-10k-test-positivity-rate-shoots-past-20-101618539013289.html
16-04-2021||Delhi||In Delhi markets, new Covid-19 curbs reinforce fears of another full lockdown||The imposition of a series of restrictions in Delhi, including a curfew this weekend, has reinforced fears of a lockdown in markets and among the interconnected network of stakeholders, ranging from traders, employees and warehouse keepers to transporters and porters.“The lockdown was hell... Buses were stopped. We struggled to get home. We had no source of income in the city for days,” said Balram Singh, a porter in east Delhi’s Gandhi Nagar market. He said he returned to Delhi from his village in Bihar’s Sitamarh district in October.OP Gupta, president of wholesale garment traders’ association in Gandhi Nagar, said fears of a shutdown run deep.“For instance, a wholesale market for jeans will be associated with manufacturers. Each manufacturer will be associated with few ancillary units supplying labels, zips, and other such things. Each shop in the market will have helpers, accountants, and other employees, and regularly deal with porters, labourers, and transporters. It’s an entire ecosystem... The fear of a lockdown is not limited to traders and shop owners.”Ankit Kumar, who works as a helper at a garment shop in Sadar Bazar, said: “During the lockdown last year, I managed to stay in Delhi and keep my job with a pay cut. But there is no point living in Delhi if I cannot save any money to send back home to Gorakhpur [in Uttar Pradesh]. If the government is planning another lockdown, I have to make plans too.”However, market association officials said a few groups of traders have demanded a short lockdown, saying that the Capital’s Covid-19 graph had spiked at alarming levels.Sanjay Bhargava, president of Chandni Chowk Sarv Vyapar Mandal said, “We have insisted that traders support their employees during the short lockdown, which is much-needed to break the chain of transmission. If people are assured that they will have food, shelter and that they will not lose their jobs, they will not start heading back to their villages.”Devraj Baweja, general secretary of the Confederation of Sadar Bazar Traders’ Association, said, “We have stressed on staggered timings and the importance of distancing in the market, so that a lockdown-like situation does not arise.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/in-delhi-markets-new-covid-19-curbs-reinforce-fears-of-another-full-lockdown-101618537989462.html

16-04-2021||Delhi||Tough time for restaurants in Delhi: Owners||New Delhi The government’s order disallowing dine-in services in all restaurants in the city, and allowing only deliveries, will devastate an already ailing industry, owners of several eateries in the national capital said on Thursday, citing the impact of last year’s nationwide lockdown and subsequent restrictions such as the night curfew.Some stakeholders also contended that the industry will have to overhaul its processes within days to focus solely on deliveries.SN Kaushal, senior manager of Kwality restaurant, Connaught Place, said a number of things, including staff rosters and salary disbursement, will need to be altered to adjust to the new curbs.“When we started deliveries in June, we could barely make a fraction of the previous sales. Running the restaurant comes with costs, and we will have to shell out to divert all our resources to focus on deliveries. There will be a massive burden on resources due to the shift,” he said, adding that arranging e-passes for his staff was already proving cumbersome.Experts, however, pointed out that restaurants are particularly dangerous in terms of virus spread.Dr Jugal Kishore, head of the department of community medicine at Delhi’s Safdarjung hospital, said that in the current situation, curbs on indoor sitting were necessary to stop the transmission of infection. “Indoor sitting creates a problem. People take off their masks to talk and eat, which increases the chances of transmission,” Kishore said.Restaurant owners maintained that the hit to their business would be hard.Saurabh Suman, manager of Pebble Street in New Friends Colony, said the restaurant’s sales dropped around 70% since the night curfew was imposed on April 6, and feared the latest order will increase losses.“Due to the surge in cases, only a handful of people were stepping out. Our business will nosedive with the closure of dine-in services. We foresee that sales will drop by 90%,” he said.He said the restaurant-cum-bar will adjust service staff into the delivery chain to keep the business running. “We will rotate service staff and use their services for deliveries. Our plan is to use their services in different capacities so we don’t arrive in a situation where we have to let go of people. Our sales have already taken a big hit, but we will have to abide by the orders,” Suman said.Ramesh Kitchloo, founder of Samavar restaurant in Pamposh Enclave, said Thursday’s orders will be the death knell for the industry. “Lakhs have assembled for the Kumbh Mela. Is there no Covid-19 at Kumbh, or in Kolkata where huge [election] rallies are being held? The government has no objections to such gatherings but restaurants that are barely making ends meet are being punished despite complying with rules. This is a massive disaster,” said Kitchloo.Manpreet Singh, treasurer of the National Restaurants Association of India, which is a representative body with more than 5,000 members across the country, said the new measure was a blow. “It is unjust for governments to crack down on restaurants every time there is a Covid-19 surge but not impose any restrictions on political rallies and religious congregations,” said Singh, adding there was no relaxation in the rent and other duties and fees that restaurants were paying to the government and civic agencies.A senior government official said curbs were necessary to break the chain of transmission, and that restrictions were inevitable due to the surge in cases||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/tough-time-for-restaurants-in-delhi-owners-101618534702436.html
16-04-2021||Delhi||'Extension of weekend curbs will depend on Delhi’s graph,' say officials||Stricter curbs may be imposed in Delhi if the number of Covid-19 cases and the positivity rate continue to rise at the pace they are, senior administration officials said on Thursday after chief minister Arvind Kejriwal announced a curfew this weekend and imposed widespread restrictions as the pandemic continued to spiral out of control in Delhi.“The order issued on Thursday imposes a weekend curfew only from 10pm on Friday to 5am on Monday. Extending the restriction for more weekends or imposing stricter curbs on the lines of Maharashtra will solely depend on Delhi’s Covid-19 curve — the positivity rate in the next few days. So the coming week will be crucial,” said a senior health official.In Delhi, the latest test positivity rate was 20.22%, the highest in 294 days.This number has shot up over the past few weeks, well past the 5% threshold as recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO).Delhi’s positivity rate fell below 5% on December 3. It then dropped to below 1% on December 28, and stayed beneath that number for 82 days.The city also has over 54,000 active cases now — the highest ever.The official quoted above said the Delhi government and the Lieutenant Governor (L-G) will review Thursday’s restrictions in the coming week to decide if more stringent curbs are needed, factoring in the impact of the fresh curbs on the Capital’s Covid-19 case trajectory.A second government official actively involved in Delhi’s Covid management plan said the city administration is closely monitoring the recent curbs announced in Maharashtra, which is witnessing the steepest surge in cases among all states. The Maharashtra government this week announced the imposition of Section 144 across the state till 7am on May 1.“Cases are increasing at an unprecedented rate, which has forced the government to impose these restrictions. It is expected the restrictions will help slow down the spread of the disease. Otherwise, no amount of additional hospital beds, ICUs and ventilators will be sufficient. The restrictions should help increase mask compliance and adherence to distancing among the masses,” said a second senior official who did not wish to be identified.Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday expressed concern over the Covid-19 situation in Delhi and imposed a weekend curfew, temporarily shut shopping malls, gyms, spas and entertainment parks, capped the capacity of cinema halls and multiplexes at 30%, barred dining at restaurants, and limited weekly markets to one per day in a single municipal zone. The night curfew, in place till April 30, will continue, the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) said in its order.“On weekdays, people have to earn their livelihood. But on the weekend, people go out for entertainment and other activities, which can be curtailed. Hence, to break the chain of infections, we are imposing a weekend curfew,” said Kejriwal, an hour after a meeting with L-G Anil Baijal on the Capital’s coronavirus situation.“We will not allow any inconvenience to those involved in essential services like going to hospitals, railway stations or airports as well as weddings. We will issue passes for their movement quickly and without harassment,” Kejriwal added.Experts, however, said such restrictions should have been imposed in Delhi much earlier, which they said would have bought DDMA time to review the situation.Dr Lalit Kant, former head of the division of epidemiology and communicable diseases at the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) said, “It is too late. In Delhi, such curbs should have been imposed much earlier — ideally, by mid or end-March, when cases started increasing at a decent pace. That would have given the government more time to review and assess the impact of the curbs and take decisions on future course of actions. Assessment of such restrictions is not feasible in short time windows.”Dr Jacob John, former head of the clinical virology department at Christian Medical College in Tamil Nadu’s Vellore, said, “The effects of such restrictions are not likely to reflect in Covid-19 numbers in just a week. The government should have imposed such restrictions in Delhi at least three weeks ago. At this stage, the government should develop more strategies to improve mask compliance. It is evident that large-scale transmission is happening in Delhi and such restrictions cannot be imposed for long durations. People will come out and start making social contact again. The government has to ensure that they are all masked. There is no other way to arrest transmission in the long run.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/extension-of-weekend-curbs-will-depend-on-delhi-s-graph-101618528023137.html
16-04-2021||Delhi||Umar Khalid gets bail in a riots case, to stay in jail||A Delhi court on Thursday granted bail to former JNU student union leader Umar Khalid in connection with the riots that broke out in Khajuri Khas area of north-east Delhi in February last year, saying that he was not present on the scene of crime and that he cannot be kept behind bars on the basis of “sketchy material”.Khalid, however, will continue to remain in jail in connection with the case regarding the conspiracy behind the north-east Delhi riots in which he was booked under the stringent Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA).Additional sessions judge Vinod Yadav said Khalid was neither captured in any CCTV footage nor viral video, nor any independent witness or any police witness identified him in the crowd at the crime scene.“Prima facie, the applicant appears to have been roped in the matter merely on the basis of his own disclosure statement and disclosure statement of co-accused Tahir Hussain. The statement of Rahul Kasana (witness) is yet to be tested on the touchstone of evidence….”“The applicant cannot be permitted to remain behind bars in this case on the basis of such sketchy material against him,” the court said.As many as 53 people were killed and more than 400 injured in the riots that broke out in parts of north-east Delhi on February 23, 2020. Police have registered 755 cases related to the communal violence that was allegedly triggered after clashes between those protesting against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and those supporting it.The FIR in the Khajuri Khas case was registered on the statement of constable Sangram Singh, in which he alleged that on February 24, 2020 at about 2pm, a large crowd gathered on the road in a locality in north-east Delhi and started pelting stones. The constable alleged that the mob thrashed him and other police officials.Singh alleged that the mob set ablaze vehicles in a parking area, including his motorcycle.On Thursday, the court said the sole evidence of this “so called conspiracy” is a statement by a witness Rahul Kasana, in which he stated while he was standing outside a building in Shaheen Bagh, where he had dropped principal accused Tahir Hussain, he saw Umar Khalid and Khalid Saifi going in the same building.“I fail to understand from the aforesaid statement how a lofty claim of conspiracy can be inferred. In my humble opinion, chargesheeting the applicant in this case on the basis of such an insignificant material is unwarranted. I have deliberately not touched the material sought to be relied upon by the police against the applicant in case FIR No.59/2020 (investigated by Special Cell),” the judge said in his 12-page order.The court also rejected the prosecution’s argument that Khalid was in regular contact with co-accused Tahir Hussain and Khalid Saifi over mobile phone and said that “prima facie that does not in any way go on to establish the criminal conspiracy alleged against the applicant in the matter”.“The applicant cannot be made to incarcerate in jail for infinity merely on account of the fact that other persons who were part of the riotous mob have to be identified and arrested in the matter,” it said.It granted bail to Khalid on a personal bond of Rs.20,000 with one surety of the like amount while adding that he will not tamper with evidence or influence any witness in any manner.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/umar-khalid-gets-bail-in-a-riots-case-to-stay-in-jail-101618527542670.html

16-04-2021||Chandigarh||Open to imposing weekend curfew, says Chandigarh admn amid Covid surge||From imposing weekend curfew to bringing back the odd-even system for shops in the city, the UT administration is considering a slew of options to rein in the surging Covid-19 cases in the city. Closure of apni mandis, gyms, spas, cinemas and malls is also on the table, while restaurants may be allowed to provide only take-away service. A complete ban on social, cultural and religious events may also be considered, besides change in staffing pattern at offices, such as allowing only 50% strength. Stating that all options were being considered, UT adviser Manoj Parida said, “We will take a call on the measures to be taken in the meeting scheduled on Friday.” The administration is also working out the modalities for distribution of free food and accommodation for migrant labourers in case weekend curfew is enforced. On Tuesday, UT had reintroduced weekend closure at Sukhna Lake and had also shut down Rock Garden on all days. The night curfew was also extended – now being enforced from 10pm to 5am, instead of 10.30pm to 5am. In the neighbouring districts of Mohali and Panchkula, the curfew is from 9pm to 5am. It was in September last year, when the administration had ended the odd-even system for shops and markets in the city. As part of the fresh measures, the restriction on visitors at the Deputy Commission’s office may be introduced at other offices as well. “It can be a total ban on visitors or restricted entry so as to minimise rush in offices,” said a UT official. Special vaccination camps Urging resident welfare bodies to persuade eligible people to get the Covid-19 vaccine, the adviser said the defaulters should be named and shamed.“Any group, association or society can approach the administration with a list of 100 eligible people for a special camp in the area. Ambulances are also available for free pick-up of old and disabled persons,” said Parida.Box: 12 more areas sealed The UT administration on Thursday declared 12 more micro-containment zones in the city, taking their number up to 134. On Tuesday, the administration had notified 57 such zones. Three areas were sealed in Sector 7, two each in Sectors 38 and 49, and one each in Sectors 27, 39, 46, 51 and 40.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/open-to-imposing-weekend-curfew-says-chandigarh-admn-amid-covid-surge-101618519512476.html

16-04-2021||Chandigarh||Ex-Akali MLA Virsa Singh Valtoha acquitted in 1983 Patti doctor murder case||A court in Tarn Taran on Thursday acquitted former Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) legislator Virsa Singh Valtoha in the case of murder of Patti-based doctor Sudarshan Kumar Trehan in 1983 due to “lack of evidence”. Valtoha, who remained chief parliamentary secretary in the SAD-BJP government, was facing trial in the case since February 2019 after the police presented a supplementary challan against him after 36 years of the incident. The development came as relief to the former MLA ahead of the 2022 assembly elections as SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal announced his candidature from the Khemkaran constituency last month. “The case was heard in the court of additional district and sessions judge Charanjit Singh Arora on Thursday. Five witnesses, including Jaswant Kaur (posted as Tarn Taran superintendent of police at the time of filing supplementary challan), one Sukhjinder Kaur and a doctor who conducted the post-mortem on the victim’s body, were presented in the court. The judge acquitted the former MLA after hearing the arguments from both the sides,” said Valtoha’s counsel JS Dhillon. Assistant district attorney Ramneet Kaur said, “Many of the witnesses in the case have died. The accused was acquitted as we did not have any eyewitnesses.” A senior police official said they recently submitted a report about the witnesses in the court. “Many of the witnesses had died while some could not be traced,” he added. In February 2020, the court of additional sessions judge Paramjit Kaur had asked the Tarn Taran senior superintendent of police (SSP) to submit a report on the witnesses and arrange for those who were alive so that the case may be taken into its logical end. Dr Trehan was murdered in his clinic at Patti on September 30, 1983. The Akali leader was named as one of the accused in the case after one Hardev Singh purportedly told the police a year later that he, Valtoha and another person were behind the murder. Valtoha got bail in the case in February 1991, but the police never presented a supplementary chargesheet against him. He had been claiming that the court concerned had discharged him from the case. The other accused, Hardev and Baldev Singh, were acquitted in November 1990. Terming the judgment as a “victory of truth”, Valtoha said, “It was a deep-rooted conspiracy by chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh to present the chargesheet against me in the case in which I was discharged in 1991. It was a bid to destroy my political career.” He claimed that he was falsely implicated in the case, alleging “political vendetta”. Case Timeline Sept 30, 1983: Dr Sudarshan Kumar Trehan murdered in his clinic in Tarn Taran district’s Patti town. An FIR registered against unidentified persons. 1984: Police take in custody Hardev Singh who said he, Valtoha and one Baldev Singh were behind Dr Trehan’s murder. Nov 1990: Hardev and Baldev Singh acquitted in the case. Feb 1991: Valtoha gets bail in the case. Feb 2019: Police present supplementary chargesheet against Valtoha in court on the basis of a plea by a human rights organisation. Feb 2020: Court asks police to submit status report on witnesses. Sept 2020: Supreme Court expresses shock over long pendency of the case; directs state government to submit reply as to why this case was dragging for so long. April 7, 2021: No witness produced in court against Valtoha and the matter was adjourned to April 15.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/exakali-mla-virsa-singh-valtoha-acquitted-in-1983-patti-doctor-murder-case-101618518372223.html

SGPC president Jagir Kaur said the function will be held from April 29 to May 1. “The devotees want this centenary to be celebrated with the same spirit as other centenaries. We even apprehend that the government may impose a ban on the function. Therefore, we are hesitating from appealing to the sangat to attend the event in a large number,” she said while interacting with mediapersons. “Also, we got a letter from the administration saying New Amritsar locality has been declared a containment zone where no gathering can be organised. The government should make it clear whether we cannot organise the function or not. We will ensure a small gathering on the occasion,” she added.About her meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi through video conferencing on April 8 on the 400th birth anniversary, Jagir Kaur said, “I suggested that the Union government should establish a ‘vishv shanti kendra’ (world peace centre) on the lines of the United Nations Organisation (UNO) after Guru Tegh Bahadur.”It was also suggested that a chapter on the life of the ninth guru be included in the curricula of all state school boards in India, especially in the National Council of Education Research and Training (NCERT) books, she added. “I said a SGPC representative be permanently included in the scrutiny committee so that clear and true knowledge of Sikh philosophy and history may be imparted to the students. We also urged the PM that the Gurbani (holy writings) of the ninth guru be translated in all Indian language as well as major international languages and it be made available in world-class libraries and universities,” she said.Besides, the central government was asked to issue a coin, envelope, and postage stamp on the occasion, Jagir Kaur said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/9th-guru-s-400th-birth-anniversary-sgpc-in-a-fix-over-holding-main-event-amid-worsening-covid-situation-101618517772016.html

A detailed file has been sent to the Punjab Public Service Commission (PPSC) for working on the final logistics before issuing an advertisement for the posts. The process of recruiting regular college lecturers in Punjab was last initiated in 2002 but the hiring was cancelled after the state vigilance bureau busted a cash-for-job scam that year. Since then, the recruitment of lecturers has been stalled with the matter being sub-judice. The state has a total 1,873 sanctioned posts of lecturers of which 1,292 are lying vacant. Currently, the government colleges have 581 regular lecturers only. To deal with staff shortage, 882 guest faculty members and 251 part-time lecturers have been roped in.Special secretary (higher education) Paramjit Singh, who is also director of public instructions (DPI colleges), said all the hiccups have been cleared for the recruitment.“The advertisement will be issued in the months to come,” he said. Guest faculty, part-time teachers fear job lossServing in government colleges for nearly 15 years, as many as 882 guest faculty members and 251 part-time lecturers are afraid that they may lose their jobs with the appointment of regular assistant professors. They have demanded relaxations in the recruitment process so that their jobs could be regularised.Deepak Kaushal, member of the Guest Faculty Assistant Professors’ Association, said their jobs have not been regularised till date due to bad policies of the successive state governments. “The guest faculty forms the backbone of government colleges in Punjab. The sad part is that 50% guest lecturers have crossed the age limit to apply for other government jobs. Therefore, the government must give certain relaxations related to age in the hiring process,” said Kaushal.Also, the government should ensure that their services are availed even as regular lecturers are appointed, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-to-hire-931-regular-lecturers-in-all-48-govt-colleges-after-19-years-101618517414770.html

16-04-2021||Chandigarh||Second Covid wave in Punjab has low fatality rate despite high caseload||The case fatality rate (CFR) during the second coronavirus wave in Punjab is lower than the first one that swept the state last year even as caseload this time is on the higher side, shows an analysis of the figures of the health department. In the second wave that experts say started in early January, the CFR remained 1.8% against 3% of the last time. This despite the fact that the state’s overall fatality rate so far at 2.7% is still the highest in the country, followed by Sikkim at 2.2% though less deaths brought the figure down from January’s first week when it was 3.2%. Punjab’s CFR in April remained 1.7%. State Covid-19 nodal officer Dr Rajesh Bhaskar said, “The CFR this time is low as we learnt lessons from the first wave and encouraged people to come forward for testing at the earliest. But still, a lot needs to be done as people still are as hesitant about early testing.”Peak likely in 3rd week of April Experts working in the state government’s Covid-management group say the second wave in the state may hit its peak in the third week of April when daily case count is expected to reach nearly 4,500. “Our prediction model has been near accurate so far. We look at April third week as crucial. We can minimise the impact by strictly following the protocols,” said the nodal officer. In the first wave till December 31, the state recorded 1,66,522 cases in 287 days since the first case of Covid-19 was detected in Punjab on March 18. This comes out to be 580 cases per day. But from January 1 to April 14, the state added 1,15,983 cases, in 104 days, registering a daily average of 1,115 cases. Whereas the first wave witnessed 7,632 deaths, the figure in the second is 2,330.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/second-covid-wave-in-punjab-has-low-fatality-rate-despite-high-caseload-101618517116367.html

This is more than double the new admissions logged last year. School principals say that good infrastructure and quality education have prompted many parents to shift their wards from private schools to government ones. Last year, around 14,000 students had joined the governments schools in the district between April and June. Of these, 7,000 were from private schools. This time, 3,600 students have shifted from private to government schools. The principals said the pandemic has put a lot of financial constraints on parents, who are thus shifting their wards to government schools, which offer free education to students upto Class-8 and charge nominally for Classes 9 to 12.At Government Model Senior Secondary Smart School, Punjab Agricultural University, 495 new students have enrolled in Classes 1 to 10. Of these, 467 are from private schools. The school already has a strength of 4,000 students. Principal Sanjeev Thapar said, “We are receive a large number of enquiries everyday and there is always a queue outside my room as parents are keen to admit their wards in our school. We have set up a help desk and teachers are answering the queries.”At Government Senior Secondary School, Multi-Purpose, 350 new students have been enrolled this year, of which 250 are from private schools. Due to higher enrolment, the school authorities have received the secretary education’s approval to run the school in twoshifts. Principal Navdeep Romana said, “We have informed students regarding the admission process. All the forms are available online and have to be sent on WhatsApp groups.” Government Senior Secondary School, Basti Jodhewal, which has a strength of 1,500 students has enrolled 200 new students from Classes 6 to 12. School principal Rajesh Kumar, said, “Our teachers conducted door-to-door surveys and held awareness camps in gurdwaras, due to which over 110 students from private schools have shifted to our school. Last year, over 500 new students had registered online and were admitted. We except more students to enrol in the coming days.”Harjit Singh, district education officer (secondary-cum-elementary), said, “School principals and teachers are making efforts to enhance the enrolment in their schools. Door-to-door campaigning and hoardings installed at public places have helped the schools. Most parents are preferring to send their wards to government schools as our schools now have good infrastructure and offer free education till Class 8 and charge only a nominal fee for senior classes. ”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/in-just-2-weeks-ludhiana-govt-schools-enrol-more-students-than-last-year-101618516512819.html

The model jail complex has a land parcel of 47 acres. The existing model jail is spread over 14 acres. It includes barracks, offices and residential accommodation for jail officials and staff. The new jail will come up on around six acres, which are currently vacant. “While the old model jail has a capacity to house 1,120 inmates, the new jail will be able to accommodate at least 376 inmates. There will be five barracks for 70 inmates each. There will also be exclusive barrack for hardcore inmates with a capacity of 26 persons,” said Ojha. The completed works should be 2.24 lakh sq ft, which includes the existing area of 1.63 lakh sq ft and the proposed new construction area of 65,876 sq ft, he added. On the need of the new jail, Virat, additional inspector general-cum-superintendent, prisons, said, “The new jail, which will be part of the existing establishment, is required to meet the future requirements. The city’s population is growing, which requires expanded prison space. The new jail will also help in providing latest facilities to visitors and inmates.” The new building will also have skill development centre, study centre, central tower, kitchen, administrative block, anganwadi kitchen, waiting hall, cabin for security person and sentry post. The administration has invited online tenders from eligible and established consultants for preparation of environmental impact assessment (EIA). The EIA will be used to obtain the environmental and eco-sensitive clearance for the new model jail. The bids of the tender documents will be opened on April 20. The firm would have to submit application to ministry of environment and forest for grant of environmental clearance within 15 days of allotment of work. In 30 days, it would submit rapid EIA study after grant of terms of reference by the state expert appraisal committee. After the grant of clearance, the firm must submit the application to the Chandigarh Pollution Control Committee within 15 days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/process-to-build-new-model-jail-at-chandigarh-s-sector-51-set-in-motion-101618516452099.html

It also marks the Sikh New Year and commemorates the formation of Khalsa Panth by tenth Sikh master Guru Gobind Singh in 1699, Garamendi said. The Congressman from California is co-chair of the Sikh Caucus in the House.“Madam speaker, I encourage all members of the House to join me in recognising the significance of Baisakhi and those who celebrate it,” Garamendi said.In the United States, Baisakhi is celebrated with large processions, celebrations, and community service. Baisakhi celebrates community, prosperity, and continued progress in the year ahead, he said.“As our country emerges from the Covid-19 pandemic, it is critical that we celebrate the strength of our communities and the sacrifice it will take to defeat the coronavirus and look toward the future,” the lawmaker said.April 13, he said, marks the start of the beginning of the Sikh religion and the start of the Punjabi New Year. “Late 2020 and early 2021 has tested the Indian Sikh community, and I hope the coming months will be marked by peace, prosperity, and respect for all faith communities,” Garamendi said.The resolution, co-sponsored by more than a dozen other lawmakers, including Dr Ami Bera and Frank Pallone, recognises the historic, cultural, and religious significance of the festival of Baisakhi.Recognising the significance of Baisakhi to Sikh communities in the United States and around the world, the resolution expresses its respect for all communities that celebrate the festival.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/resolution-introduced-in-us-congress-to-recognise-significance-of-baisakhi-101618516392038.html

Once it starts running, the plant will help dispose of the bodies of dead animals in a scientific manner. At present, the carcasses are disposed off on the banks of Satluj river. The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has already raised objections against the practice. Disposal of carcasses had become a major concern for the MC last year when the PPCB had imposed a fine of ₹2.28 lakh each on the five groups running a hadda rodi (carcass dump) in Laddowal area for dumping waste into Sutlej.A monitoring committee, constituted by the NGT, had visited the plant on February 27 last year and observed that about 45% the construction work on the carcass plant was complete. The committee members were assured that rest of the work will be completed by February 2021. When the committee members visited the plant again in March this year, it found that the plant was not operational yet. The committee members stated, in their report, that the work on the effluent treatment plant at the site had also been completed but it wasn’t operational. The MC was to all undertake tree plantation at the site to control the stench but it had failed to do so.The report in this regard was submitted to the PPCB, which imposed an environmental compensation of ₹8 lakh upon the MC on April 13.Despite repeated attempts, municipal corporation (MC) commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal was not available for comments. Mayor Balkar Singh Sandhu said he, along with cabinet minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu, had visited the site twice to check the progress on the project. “I will speak to the officials supervising the project and seek a detailed review in the matter,” said the mayor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/carcass-plant-still-not-operational-ludhiana-mc-to-pay-rs-8-lakh-fine-101618516272108.html
16-04-2021||Chandigarh||Kotkapura verdict: Courts over indulgent towards police officials: Justice Ranjit Singh||Questioning the Punjab and Haryana high court’s decision quashing the special investigation team (SIT) probe into the Kotkapura firing case, justice Ranjit Singh (retd) said on Thursday that the courts have lately been “over indulgent towards police officials”.In a statement, retired high court judge said that so far, justice has eluded those who suffered at the hands of “trigger happy” police officials, who “killed and injured” various persons sitting on protest at Behbal Kalan and Kotkapura in 2015. “First, the then government and administration did everything to save the guilty officials, who committed serious offence of murder/attempt to murder. Lately, the courts have been over indulgent towards police officials without sparing any thought for those who were killed and injured in this firing suffering lifelong handicaps,” he said.Justice Singh had headed a one-man inquiry commission, appointed by the Capt Amarinder Singh-led Congress government in 2017, into the cases of sacrilege of Guru Granth Sahib and subsequent police firing in Faridkot district in which two Sikh protesters were killed. The incidents had happened during the rule of the Shiromani Akali Dal-BJP alliance led by chief minister Parkash Singh Badal. The panel had submitted its report in 2018. Last week, a high court bench quashed the probe reports submitted by Punjab Police special investigation team (SIT) into the Kotkapura firing case and also ordered reconstitution of SIT excluding IPS officer Kunwar Vijay Pratap Singh, much to the embarrassment of the Congress government. Justice Singh said it is public pressure that has kept the cases revived leading to filing various chargesheets against those found blameworthy.“It is rare for the courts to interfere in the investigation of crime as that is the duty of police as per the criminal jurisprudence. The defect or infirmities in investigation, if any, are to be pleaded and proved before trial court where challans are filed. Police have unhindered power to investigate crime,” he said, adding: “No accused person would ever be satisfied with investigator and accused has no right to seek change of investigation officer.” Referring to some Supreme Court judgments, Justice Singh said: “Interference in the investigation by the courts is never done, especially when police have filed challans after completion of investigation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/kotkapura-verdict-courts-over-indulgent-towards-police-officials-justice-ranjit-singh-101618515972048.html

The development comes on the heels of a recent petition filed by Nandakumar Pawar of the Shri Ekvira Aai Pratishtan, requesting an urgent interim relief in the matter.The order (a copy of which is yet to be made public) will concern five culverts that require cleaning up to allow tidal water from a free-flowing coastal creek to flow into the wetland, which has been significantly denuded over the past 10 years to due reclamation, construction and hindrances to water flow. Last November, the Bombay high court (HC) had ruled that blocking the flow of tidal water to the area would be deemed a violation.“However, as the HC’s order was not yet complied with, we approached NGT for an urgent interim relief in the matter. This was a much-needed step for ensuring the health of the wetland,” said NatConnect Foundation’s director BN Kumar, who has been campaigning to bring greater protection to the area.In September 2018, Cidco had shut 76 sluice gates using a flood-control mechanism to close high-tide water ingress. Some gates had also been damaged, which environmentalists said was starving the adjacent mangrove forests of water. In October 2019, following complaints submitted to the state mangrove cell and interventions by the wetland grievance redressal committee, these gates were opened by Cidco. “But there were five culverts that still required attention. Those will now have to be cleared up as well,” said Kumar.After a plea by NatConnect Foundation, state environment minister Aaditya Thackeray had, on March 4, 2020, ordered to halt construction at Panje. Despite this, reports of intermittent landfilling have been verified in the area. Environmentalists said this order, addressed to Raigad collector and Cidco went unimplemented, after which NatConnect approached the chief minister, who asked the environment department to intervene.Subsequently, last November 2020, Narendra Toke, director, environment and climate change department, instructed the collector and Cidco to abide by the minister’s order. Toke also pointed out that hindering tidal water flow to the wetland amounts to a violation of coastal regulation zone (CRZ) norms. The government has also claimed before HC that Panje falls under CRZ-1, due to which there can be no construction without the approval of the Maharashtra Coastal Zone Management Authority (MCZMA).“Cidco, despite claiming that Panje is a holding pond as part of the flood control mechanism for the upcoming Dronagiri node, has leased out most of the wetland to Navi Mumbai SEZ (special economic zone), of which the state-owned planning agency is a 26% partner. NMSEZ built a massive compound wall around Panje and set up security cabins without any permission. The environment director has ordered NMSEZ to demolish the cabins, which were also not adhered to,” Kumar wrote in a more recent letter to CM.The Panje coastal wetland is low-lying and spread over an area of approximately 289ha. It is bounded by the Panje, Phunde, Dongari and Bokadvira villages and bordered by mangroves on the west and the east, and has mangroves inside the wetland at some locations. It is an intertidal wetland that has been formed naturally in abandoned saltpans. Due to its geographical location, it was earmarked by the planning authorities as a flood control zone as the regular tidal influence made it easy to soak and drain the water from the nearby areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ngt-asks-cidco-to-clear-water-inlets-at-panje-wetland-101618515852525.html

Narinder Garg Neeta, who left BJP and joined the Congress a couple of days back, became vice-president. The Congress has 16 seats, Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) four, Aam Aadmi Party three and Independents eight.Paramjeet Singh, alias Jonty Mann, councillor from ward number 6, claimed that he had the support of 13 councillors and his name was also proposed in the House. “Gurjeet Singh was elected with unfair means and democratic values were not followed during the election process. There was no videography of the voting. It was totally unjust. I am a committed Congressman. I will take up the matter with party high command,” said Mann.Barnala sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) Varjeet Walia said that the president and vice-president were elected with majority. “Two names were proposed. However, Gurjeet Singh got eighteen votes and was elected the chief of the nagar council,” Walia added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/barnala-nagar-council-president-elected-amid-cong-infighting-101618515852068.html

An official spokesperson said RTI activist Akash Verma sought information, but the university refused the same stating that the university was not in the ambit of the RTI. Verma approached the commission on December 24 last year by filing an appeal against the order passed by the institution. The spokesperson said that Thapar Institute of Engineering and Technology was established by the then Pepsu government in 1955 following an agreement with the Mohini Thapar Charitable Trust. Besides funds, land was provided by the erstwhile Pepsu government free of cost for the establishment of the institute. The state government and the University Grants Commission (UGC) also gave grants to the institution. Disposing of the activist’s appeal, the commission referred to a decision of the Supreme Court and declared the university a “public authority”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/thapar-university-patiala-falls-under-ambit-of-rti-act-101618515732739.html

The move, officials said, will help in streamlining the management of potentially dangerous refuse, of which about 37% annually goes untreated in the state. A recent circular issued by MPCB states that only registered transport services — which sign binding memorandums of understanding (MoUs) with their waste generators — will be allowed to transport hazardous waste materials in the state after May 21 to the four registered treatment sites in the state. As per data with MPCB, there are 7,116 industrial units of varying sizes which produce hazardous waste in Maharashtra. These together generate about 1 million tonnes of hazardous waste annually. “As per the 2008 solid waste management notification, MPCB used to give authorisation to third party transporters to collect hazardous waste from generators and send to recyclers. However, as per the revised 2016 rules, it became mandatory that we give such authorisation only to waste generators and recyclers, and not transporters. Now, generators or recyclers need to reach out to us, sign an MoU with their vendors or use a verified third party transporter who will sign an MoU with them. Only then such transporters will be authorised and be able to identify from which industries they collect hazardous waste,” said Nandkumar Gurav, regional officer with MPCB. The underlying aim, Gurav explained, is to capture the 37% hazardous waste that goes untreated in the state each year. “If we can keep track of the transporter, where they go and come, and how much waste they transport, there is less chance of it being disposed of unscientifically in transit,” he said. To increase accountability in this sector, Gurav also said MPCB has created a new app to monitor the collection, transport and treatment of hazardous waste. “We have an online hazardous waste management web system which will store all details regarding the quantum of waste generated in a certain place and track the movement of this waste from generator to recycler. By assigning registered transporters’ vehicles with a specific industrial unit, we will be able to monitor their compliance,” Gurav said, adding that implementation of this programme is being fast-tracked after a recent town hall on waste management in Maharashtra, organised under the environment department’s Majhi Vasundhara campaign.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/maharashtra-pollution-control-body-takes-steps-to-streamline-mgmt-of-hazardous-waste-101618515731336.html

The contest is being seen as a test for the three-party coalition as it is the first Assembly bypoll since MVA came to power in 2019. Also, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has made the contest more interesting by linking it with the dislodging of the Uddhav Thackeray-led government.“Leave it to me on when the government needs to be changed, don’t worry about that. But now the bypoll is necessary as the people of Pandharpur got the first chance to show the government, which is involved in all sorts or corrupt practices, its place…. You just elect Samadhan Autade,” former chief minister (CM) and leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis said, while addressing a campaign rally on Monday.Deputy CM and senior Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader Ajit Pawar, while addressing another campaign rally on Thursday – the last day for campaigning – responded by saying, “The one who can dislodge this government is yet to be born… We don’t poke our nose in others’ business but also don’t spare those who try to cross our path.”The voting will be held on April 17.BJP is making all the efforts to win the seat to prove that there is a discontent against the Thackeray government. NCP, too, has put all its force, and most of its senior leaders, including Pawar and state chief Jayant Patil, have been campaigning aggressively. Baramati parliamentarian and party chief Sharad Pawar’s daughter Supriya Sule, too, addressed a rally through video-conferencing.State Congress chief Nana Patole campaigned for the candidate Bhagirath Bhalke on Thursday. However, no senior Shiv Sena leader found to have campaigned for the NCP candidate. Sena rebel Shaila Godse is contesting the bypoll as an Independent. The party could not persuade her to withdraw her candidature. To control possible damage, Pawar has been meeting local Sena leaders to ensure they will also put their strength behind Bhalke in the bypoll, said an NCP leader.NCP fielded Bhalke after his father Bharat, the sitting legislator, died last November. He will face BJP’s Autade, who had fought the last Assembly elections as an independent candidate and secured the third position after getting 54,124 votes. In 2014, he got 40,910 votes as a Shiv Sena candidate.Bharat Bhalke was a three-term legislator and NCP is hoping that the sympathy will work in his son’s favour, as he is trying to take his father’s legacy ahead.“MVA is in a strong position in Solapur as all the three parties — Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress — are united in fighting the election against BJP. Our position became stronger after BJP leader Kalyan Kale joined NCP recently. People have sympathy for Bhalke as his father has brought so much development in the constituency which will ultimately help him in this election,” said Deepak Salunkhe Patil, vice-president NCP and former legislator from Solapur district.Political analysts believe that BJP has better prospects, as it has brought Autade and Prashant Paricharak together for the polls. The Paricharak family has a strong base and sympathies in Pandharpur. Paricharak’s uncle Sudhakar was a five-term legislator from the constituency. “The constituency is divided into three major groups, each led by Bhalke, Paricharak and Autade. By fielding Autade, BJP has brought Paricharak and Autade together against Bhalke making it a tough fight for MVA. Fadnavis has also given the responsibility of Autade’s election to Paricharak by assuring him better prospects in coming future,” said the editor of a Marathi daily, who did not wished to be named.However, Paricharak wanted BJP to field his nephew Pranay but the party chose Autade over him, which may not have gone down well with the family and his supporters, it is believed.State BJP spokesperson Keshav Upadhye said, “The state government has failed to provide any relief to the farmers after coming to power, which we have highlighted in our campaign. Moreover, they chose to disconnect the power connections of agriculture pumps, adding to farmers’ misery. They should have realised that the agrarian community is in trouble and have no money to pay the power bills,” he said.The disconnection of power is a major issue which may go against the NCP candidate. But people have sympathy with Bhalke, said the editor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/maharashtras-pandharpur-all-set-for-mla-bypoll-tomorrow-101618515671362.html

In a statement, Mohindra said the same BJP leaders were not able to appoint a Hindu deputy chief minister in 2007 and 2012 when they could have done it easily. “In 2007, the SAD government was completely dependent on the BJP’s support and it had won 19 out of 21 seats it contested. Even then, it could not assert itself to get a Hindu appointed as a deputy CM and now the party has the audacity to announce a Dalit CM when it has no existence at all in the state,” he said. Referring to the announcement, he said the party’s credibility is at its nadir as it could not watch the interests of the people it claims to represent. “These are simply survival tactics and are not going to help the party in any way,” he said.Don’t indulge in politics of identity: Tewari to Sukhbir A day after SAD chief Sukhbir Singh Badal announced he would give the Punjab deputy CM’s post to a Dalit if his party wins in 2022, Congress leader Manish Tewari on Thursday asked him whether the position of chief minister was reserved for someone.Tewari, the MP from Anandpur Sahib constituency, also said that the SAD leader should desist from indulging in “politics of identity”.Sukhbir on Wednesday had promised to give the post of Punjab deputy chief minister to a Dalit if his party is voted to power in the assembly polls next year.Reacting to the statement, Tewari asked Sukhbir: “Why only deputy chief minister, why not a Dalit as chief minister? Is the top position reserved for someone permanently? “Once the Pandora’s box of identity politics is opened, then people will legitimately demand, if not ask, as why a Hindu should not be chief minister or for that matter, someone from the OBC (other backward classes) community should not then be the chief minister of the state,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/mohindra-questions-bjp-s-promise-to-appoint-dalit-cm-101618515612601.html

The court’s decision came after two members of the standing committee – a statutory body that approves and allocates funds required for civic body’s various projects or works – sought an offline meeting, citing that the 35 issues to be decided upon were “important”. However, though the court rescheduled the meeting, it also held that held that if courts could function virtually in light of the surge in the Covid-19 cases, the standing committee meeting too could be held online, and disposed of the public interest litigation (PIL). The vacation bench of justice Suresh Gupte and justice Abhay Ahuja, while hearing the PIL filed by sitting Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) corporators Vinod Mishra and Makarand Narwekar, was informed by advocate Jeet Gandhi that the petition challenged BMC’s April 12 proposal to conduct the standing committee meeting on April 15 (Thursday) virtually. Gandhi submitted that as 35 issues involving crores of rupees, including the one pertaining to Nahur railway station, was on the agenda, at least 27 members of the standing committee and the BMC officials concerned be allowed to conduct a physical meeting by following Covid-19 protocols. Gandhi said the petitioners’ insisted on physical meeting because they apprehended that the agenda would be passed with a brute majority through virtual hearing by muting Opposition members. He added that BMC had not followed proper procedure, as it had intimated members about the meeting being held on virtual mode only on Wednesday night, as a result of which the 24-hour notice period was not abided, and hence, the meeting be postponed. Senior counsel Anil Sakhare argued that as the state government had restricted congregation of more than 25 persons, the panel meeting could not be held physically. He further added that the issues on agenda would be taken up as per serial numbers. After the court asked if the meeting could be held virtually on Friday, Sakhare took instructions from the committee’s chairman and BMC commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal and informed the court that the meeting would be rescheduled to Friday noon through videoconferencing instead of Thursday. While disposing of the petition, the bench noted, “The petitioners should be permitted to effectively attend and place submissions before the meeting. Petitioners will also be entitled to record the entire proceedings of the April 16 [Friday’s] meeting. We have not applied our mind to the merits of the controversy raised by the petitioners.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/hc-reschedule-mumbai-civic-body-panel-meeting-for-friday-101618515491331.html

The petitioners informed the court that they did not seek reopening of dining halls in temples like last year but only wanted devotees to be allowed to pick up packets of boiled, non-spicy pious food, made especially during the fasting period, from the temple in specific slots from April 19 to 27. The court held that it was a reasonable request and hence, the government should consider it. The bench also asked the petitioning temple trusts to find a workable solution to avoid flocking of devotees at the temple to collect the food parcels. The vacation bench of justice Suresh Gupte and justice Abhay Ahuja, while hearing the petitions filed by two temple trusts – Shree Trust Atman Kamal Labdhisurishwarji Jain Gyanmandir Trust and Sheth Motisha Religious and Charitable Trust – was informed by advocate Prafulla Shah that the petitioners were seeking a limited relief. Shah, while objecting to the government circular of April 13 which permitted hotels and restaurants to give away parcels, said the circular, by ordering closure of all religious places of worship for 15 days till May 1, was not allowing parcel distribution to temple trusts. After hearing the submissions, the bench asked the state government whether such prayers could be allowed. “The request seems reasonable. They are not opening the religious places, but just for providing food parcels,” HC said. However, additional government pleader Jyoti Chavan submitted that the state government would not permit take away of the food as congregation of people needed to be avoided as per recent standard operating procedure (SOPs). When the bench suggested that the trusts appoint volunteers to deliver food instead of having devotees gather near the temple, Chavan submitted that allowing such an arrangement would be considered as a bias by the state government towards one community. She referred to an order of another bench of HC on Wednesday which refused permission to the trustees of Juma Masjid to allow 50 devotees to offer prayers five times a day during the holy month of Ramzan. Chavan, however, added that if entering premises of the places of worship did not arise and a workable solution for food delivery as per SOPs was followed, the state could consider the request. Thereafter, the bench directed the parties to find a workable solution and place it before the bench on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/find-solution-for-jain-devotees-to-avail-pious-food-without-flouting-norms-bombay-hc-to-state-trusts-101618515371369.html

The lawyer has tested positive after the arrest and has been admitted to a hospital in Panvel.According to the police, the complainant, 32-year-old Navnath Gole, is a businessman. He was arrested by the economic offences wing (EOW) of the Ahmedabad Police in January for cheating after a business deal went wrong. “Gole’s wife then met a lawyer, Vimal Jha, to bail her husband out. Jha demanded a fee of ₹70 lakh. Gole’s wife paid him ₹12 lakh through real-time gross settlement (RTGS) and ₹58 lakh in cash. Gole was released on bail by an Ahmedabad court on March 3,” said an officer from Kharghar police station.“A few days later, Jha met Gole and demanded ₹3 crore. He threatened to get Gole’s bail cancelled in case he failed to pay the money. On the night of April 2, Jha called Gole to his office at Belapur and demanded the money again. When Gole refused to pay, Jha, with the help of three others, kidnapped him in a car and took him to a farmhouse at Karjat. “They also confiscated his phones and assaulted him. They kept insisting on transferring some of his property to Jha’s name. The following day, they left Gole at Kharghar and threatened to kill him if he revealed the incident anything to anyone,” the officer said.Gole, however, approached the police. Inspector Bimal Bidve from Kharghar police station said, “We arrested Jha from Nashik from April 5. However, he was tested positive for Covid-19, hence the court granted him judicial custody. He is hospitalised. We are now hoping to arrest the other three aides.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/navi-mumbai-cops-arrest-lawyer-for-kidnapping-client-for-3-cr-ransom-101618515311273.html

In March, the district had recorded a female mortality rate of 43%. In just 14 days (April 14), it went up to 44%. In January and February, the Covid mortality rate among women in Ludhiana was lower at 22% and 17% respectively. Out of the 34 female deaths in the first 14 days of April, 15 were from rural areas while 19 were from urban areas. The youngest female to succumb to the virus was a 32-year-old while the oldest was an 84-year-old. With 17 casualties, the 60-plus age group witnessed the most number of deaths. In the 50 to 59 age group, there were 13 female fatalities while four women, under the age of 50, lost their battle to the contagion this month. Experts say the main reason behind the rising fatalities is that women don’t receive timely medical attention. “As per our findings, women, especially those in rural areas, ignore their health and their family members too don’t pay any attention to their deteriorating condition. Most of them keep working even when they are sick and visit the hospital only when things get out of control,” said cardiologist Dr Bishav Mohan, who is also a member of the Covid-19 task force of the state government. Earlier, a study by the Dayanand Medical College and Hospital (DMCH) had revealed that fewer elderly women than men are coming forward to get vaccinated against the deadly virus. Civil surgeon Dr Sukhjeevan Kakkar said that in most cases, it is the youngsters who bring home the virus with their reckless behaviour and it is the elderly, especially women, who pay the price for it. Dr Gaurav Sachdeva, who is handling Covid care at Arora Neuro Centre in Ludhiana said, “There is a lot of misinformation floating around about the virus. The conspiracy theories that claim that the virus is a hoax or a government propaganda are the main reasons why many people are not taking the disease seriously or following the protocols.” Dr Rajoo Singh Chhina, director, gastroenterology, Fortis Hospital, Ludhiana, and technical advisor UNIDO (United Nations) observed that as compared to the first wave, the fear factor has also diminished. “Earlier people used to rush to the hospital as soon as they started showing the symptoms, but now patients, especially those from rural areas, are arriving at the hospital only at a very later stage, which is leading to a rise in mortality,” said Dr Chhina.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/covid-mortality-among-women-on-rise-in-ludhiana-101618515192348.html

The couple was sentenced to 10 years in jail in a drug case in Qatar in 2019. However, the highest court in Qatar recently cleared the couple of all the charges after the family fought a hard battle. Qureshi and Oniba, who visited Qatar for their honeymoon, were arrested at Hamad International Airport in July 2019 after authorities recovered over 4kg of hashish in their bag. The couple’s family later discovered that their relative Tabassum Qureshi had allegedly placed the narcotics in Qureshi and Oniba’s bag. She had sponsored the trip for them and allegedly wanted to use the couple for transporting the drugs. “We had no plans of a second honeymoon. My father’s sister told us that she had planned a honeymoon for us in Doha as a gift and also wished to send some tobacco parcels to her associates in Qatar. We had refused to go. But we trusted her and landed in trouble,” Qureshi said. “After being detained, we were first lodged in separate rooms for seven days and life was hell. We were freezing because of the ACs and the blankets had not been washed for days. There were no washrooms and we had to call the guards to go to the toilet. The guards would take 20 minutes to come. In the jail, the co-inmates used to abuse me for using my wife for the narcotics trade. They would see me as bad human being. Those were the most traumatised days of our lives,” said Qureshi. After spending five months in jail, a trial court sentenced the two to 10 years imprisonment. The family challenged the verdict in the high court, which upheld the lower court’s verdict. “We had lost all hopes as we were completely blank about the case and the judicial system of the country,” Qureshi said. “We would cry all day. We would think why would our aunt do this to us. We had never done any wrong to anyone. Just because we trusted a relative, we had to suffer so much,” said Oniba breaking down. Despite being pregnant, Oniba could meet Qureshi only three times. She delivered a girl last year on February 26. “After repeatedly writing letters for eight months, seeking permission to meet my newborn, the authorities allowed me and I could meet my daughter, Aayat, only after eight months of her birth,” Sharique said. Meanwhile, the couple’s family followed up the matter with the Indian authorities and also approached the Qatari Apex court. On March 29, the Court of Cassation, the highest Court in Qatar, ordered to release the couple. “I was in Qatar for 15 months, fighting the legal battle for my children. It wasn’t easy for us as the legal system there is different. If you speak against the court’s verdict, they consider it as disrespect to their judicial system and prosecute you,” said Qureshi’s father Sharif Ahmed. Oniba’s mother Parveen Kausar said, “We were worried for our kids as there was health emergency across the globe due to Covid-19. And because of this the legal procedure to get out kids back got delayed by almost a year unnecessarily. But finally they could return home and that too, in the holy month of Ramadan. I am thankful to our police, NCB (Narcotics Control Bureau) and external affairs minister S Jaishankar.” Qureshi was employed with a Japanese company, but after the arrest, he lost his job. “I have to start my life afresh and I don’t know whether I will get a job or not during the pandemic,” he said. After completing all the formalities and paperwork they reached home at Bhendi Bazaar by 5am on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/saw-daughter-8-months-after-her-birth-mumbai-man-released-from-qatar-jail-in-narcotics-case-101618515132513.html

On an average, 18 infected bodies are being burnt daily in each of the crematoriums at Bhagwatdass, Bhaironghat and Sidhnath ghats, they said.In the past two weeks, these crematoriums received 125 bodies. But the scenario changed in the past one week, said the employees, adding that they incinerated 20 bodies on Wednesday night, 18 of which were of corona positive people. “The temperature of the fireproof brick platform on which the body is kept for incineration remains 900 to 1000 degrees, whereas it should not be more than 600 degrees,” said an employee. We fear the chimney and other parts of incinerator may start melting,” he added. Puttan Mishra, a priest at Bhaironghat, said the number of traditional cremations (with wood) has also increased. The number, he said, has doubled in one week from the average 20 to 40 bodies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/cremation-sites-in-kanpur-working-overtime-35-new-platforms-set-up-101618514951363.html

After the government order, the medical university will function as a Covid facility from Monday (April 19), said KGMU officials. “A decision on running emergency services in departments such as trauma, cardiology and gynaecology will be taken by the state government,” they stated in a press statement.The gynaecology and cardiology departments are in separate buildings on one side of the road, along with the psychiatry and geriatric mental health department while the remaining departments are on the main campus, on the other side of the road. “Beds will be increased at KGMU and Balrampur hospital in a phased manner,” said Amit Mohan Prasad, additional chief secretary, medical health. The state government aims to collectively add about 2,500 beds at KGMU and Balrampur hospital. Preparations in this regard have already begun on the KGMU campus. “The plan is on and it will be implemented shortly,” said vice-chancellor Lt Gen Bipin Puri, when asked about the implementation of the decision to make KGMU a dedicated Covid facility. The KGMU campus houses the trauma centre building, Centenary Hospital phase one and two buildings on one side and most of the wards here have adequate facilities for patients. Collectively, they can start around 1,000 beds without involving the buildings on the campus, said a senior faculty. Balrampur Hospital will also be operational as a dedicated Covid hospital. At present, it has 215 Covid beds, including 48 ICU beds, and the number can be doubled. Medical education minister Suresh Khanna had said that 400 Covid beds in Integral Institute and 500 in TS Mishra Medical College will also be available while Era Medical College is also being made a dedicated Covid facility.

However, we managed to ensure there is no increase in mortality rate among prisoners for many months,” said a prison officer. The prison department, since the outbreak of Covid in jails in May 2020, has not been allowing any fresh inmate without the Covid tests. Another prison officer, requesting anonymity said that all the precautionary measures which were enforced during the peak of the pandemic last year, have been put in place again. This also includes ensuring no ‘mulaqats’ (visits of prisoner’s relatives to jail to meet prisoners) at the prisons. Across the 44 prisons in the state so far, the jail authority has managed to conduct 57,524 Covid tests. “Since April 2020, a total of 3,116 prisoners have tested positive for Covid and seven succumbed to the disease. Yerwada, Kolhapur and Thane prisons have maximum active Covid positive prisoners,” the jail officer said. Since March 25, a total of 10,788 prisoners have been released to ensure no overcrowding in the prisons. But with relaxations in lockdown, new criminals are being caught by the police again and being sent to jail, hence the number of prisoners in jails are bound to increase. Some of the jail in states are highly overcrowded. The state prisons presently have 34,422 prisons against their capacity of around 26,000 prisoners.The prison authority also taking efforts to prevent the spread of the virus among its jail staffs. So far 3,896 tests have been conducted on staffs following which 717 detected positive for Covid-19. Eight jail staffers have lost a battle to the virus, while 623 recovered. At present state, prisons have 83 active Covid positive staffs.

16-04-2021||Mumbai||IB cancels exams in India, to consider predicted grades, coursework for marking||Due to rising Covid-19 cases in the state and the country, the International Baccalaureate (IB) has decided to cancel its examinations across the country. In an announcement made on Wednesday, the board said that it will use predicted grades to mark students this year.“Following ongoing conversations with our schools, associations and education boards, the IB has informed schools of our decision not to hold examinations in India due to the rising cases of Covid-19. We intend that the results of students in India should be awarded using coursework marks and predicted grades for the May 2021 session, as described in the awarding model outlined in February. For more details on the May 2021 session, students, parents and teachers are encouraged to talk to their school’s IB coordinator,” said the board in an official response.The board stated that while the students of IBDP (Class 12 equivalent) can take the non-examination route, those in the middle year’s programme (which includes Class 10) will be given alternative tasks for the evaluation process. Details on the process and the components of each of these options has been shared with schools. After the May 2020 predicted grades were higher than in previous years, IB has decided to recommend generous guidelines within which teachers will be asked to submit their predictions. “Where teachers feel these predicted grade distributions are not aligned with student performance, the IB is developing a process that will allow schools to request a different grade distribution and provide evidence that supports their claim,” stated the board.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/ib-cancels-exams-in-india-to-consider-predicted-grades-coursework-for-marking-101618513811184.html
16-04-2021||Mumbai||Equivalence of marks key criterion for Maharashtra board decision||The decision to cancel Class 10 exams of the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) has pushed the Maharashtra government to examine the feasibility of a similar measure to ensure equivalence in the scores of students passing the exams. On Wednesday, CBSE cancelled Class 10 exams and postponed Class 12 exams across the country this year in the wake of rising Covid-19 cases. Students of Class 10 will be marked on an objective criterion to be developed by the board, which is yet to be declared. On April 12, the state government postponed HSC exams (Class 12) to May end and SSC exams (Class 10) to June. However, following CBSE’s decision and a similar decision expected from ICSE and IGCSE, experts said it has become imperative for the state board to consider similar options. The need for equivalence becomes important especially in Mumbai where a large number of students across boards compete for a few coveted junior colleges leading to fierce competition for admission to Class 11. While there are more seats than applicants every year, top scorers set their eyes on a handful of sought-after junior colleges in the city.There have also been several instances in the past where concerns have been raised about state board students lagging behind their counterparts from the other boards as the latter have a more flexible and liberal marking style.“Students of the state board cannot be made to write exams when their counterparts from the other boards are at home, being evaluated based on their internal assessments. Similarly, to ensure that state board students do not lie at a disadvantage in admissions post Class 10, care needs to be taken to ensure that the board adopts a similar marking criterion as other national boards,” said an expert working with the state board on the issue. Jaywant Kulkarni, a teacher from Gandhi Bal Mandir High School in Kurla said considering the current scenario, the conduct of physical exams seems next to impossible. “In such a scenario, the government should announce that it will score students based on internal assessments as soon as possible so that schools can start preparing for the same. Under the current circumstances, school teachers who have seen the student for at least two-three years will be the best judges to assess their overall performance,” he added.Experts are worried that CBSE’s decision might just push boards into adopting a similar step which might have negative consequences on the overall learning outcomes of students. “State board students have prepared for exams for the whole year and now suddenly if they are told that the marking criteria are changed, there might be a lot of anxiety and confusion. The government needs to strike a right balance between equivalence and assessing the child’s performance in the best possible way at the moment. While physical exams seemed like an ideal way to do that even if they are postponed, CBSE’s decision might push boards towards considering internal assessments,” said Basanti Roy, former secretary of the Mumbai divisional board. BOXSome solutions the state board has come up with in the last few years to bring about a level playing field for state board students vis-a-vis other boards-Best of 5 scores where the highest scoring five subjects of the six are considered for calculating overall scores of students-Oral exams- For every 100 marks exam, 20 marks are set aside for internal assessments such as orals and practicals-Bonus marks for arts and sports Students get between 3 and 25 bonus marks for excelling in areas such as sports, drawing and different performing arts||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/equivalence-of-marks-key-criteria-for-maharashtra-board-decision-101618513751790.html

Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray expressed gratitude to Prime Minister Narendra Modi as he personally requested the PM to look into the matter in one of his virtual meetings.The permission has been granted on a request from the Haffkine Institute for transfer of technology from Bharat Biotech to producing the vaccine. This will be done by setting up a new plant for manufacturing Covid vaccine in collaboration with Bharat Biotech with an estimated cost of Rs154 crore.“The permission has been granted on the recommendations made by the expert committee. The Centre has given a year time to start the production. It has asked to constitute a team of senior technical experts from Haffkine Institute to complete the task at the earliest. The Centre has also asked the state government to appoint a senior official to monitor the progress of the project,” said a senior official.The permission from the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) for transfer of technology from Bharat Biotech that has developed the first indigenous Covid-19 vaccine in the country was sought in January this year.Haffkine is a public sector undertaking owned by the state government and has developed a number of vaccines that include anti-rabies serum, anti-venom serum, oral polio vaccine etc. It has also sought permission for fill and finish operations of Covid vaccine in which Haffkine Institute will only fill vaccines in bottles and make them ready as a product.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/centre-allows-haffkine-to-start-covaxin-production-101618513751166.html
16-04-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra mulls even tougher curbs if rules not followed||A day after a complete lockdown began across Maharashtra, the state machinery was disappointed by the violation of restrictions in most parts of the state, pushing the government to warn people of even stricter curbs related to trains, markets for essential services in a couple of days if they did not follow the rules. The state government is also expected to instruct district authorities once again about a stricter implementation of lockdown curbs. Maharashtra government imposed lockdown across the state, excluding essential services and public transport, for two weeks beginning from 8pm on Wednesday till 7 am on May 1. The response to the lockdown on its first day was a mixed bag in the state. Crowds were witnessed at market places, while crowding in local trains in Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), too, was evident during the peak hours. Relief and rehabilitation minister Vijay Wadettiwar hinted at imposing even stricter curbs for the essential sectors. The minister said that the state government is expected to take a decision in that respect. “People were found violating lockdown norms on day one of the lockdown, which was distressing. If this continues, we will take a decision in the next two days to impose stricter curbs on essential services, petrol pumps. A decision will have to be taken about local train travel too.Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray has already spoken about stricter restrictions if the expected results of the lockdown was not found. We will take a firm decision about it,” he said.Wadettiwar said t the state may even think of restricting operation of petrol pumps to only for vehicles involved in essential and emergency services. According to officials from Mantralaya, although the footfall at public places has reduced, it was not as expected. “The people are not taking it in the right spirit and are finding loopholes for violation of rules. Day by day the Covid-19 situation is worsening. Compared to last year’s lockdown, there is 40% more crowding at public places. It may be because of the decision of keeping public transport on. If this continues, the timing of operations of shops and establishments dealing in essential commodities are likely to be reduced. They will either be allowed to stay open for fewer hours or will be allowed to operate on alternate days. Similarly, the govenrment may also tap the idea of restricting operations of local trains in MMR,” said an official, requesting anonymity. Thackeray, during his meeting with district administrations on Wednesday, instructed them to enforce restrictions very strictly and take action against violators. “This time preventing the infection is very difficult and therefore the strict enforcement by the revenue and police machinery was very important. Do not lower your guard as we cannot afford to spread the infection further. There should not be any confusion while implementing the curbs,” he said. He also had told district authorities to shut down even essential services if the violation was found. “People are taking the situation very casually. Rather than enforcement by the machinery, the citizens are expected to follow the restrictions as social responsibility. The district administrations and police force will have to ensure more rigorous implementation of lockdown curbs,” Sitaram Kunte, chief secretary, Maharashtra said on Thursday. After the announcement of the lockdown on Tuesday evening, a few district collectors had requested the state government for relaxations, while most of them sought clarification on certain curbs. The state has, however, clarified that there would not be any relaxations given in the lockdown curbs and it needs to be implemented in toto. To answer doubts, the government issued a detailed clarification in form of response to frequently asked questions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-mulls-even-tougher-curbs-if-rules-not-followed-101618513631221.html
16-04-2021||Mumbai||Mumbaiites stay in on Day 1 of state-wide restrictions||Empty roads, shut shops and closed eateries – Mumbai wore a deserted look on Thursday, the first day of 15-day strict restrictions imposed by the Maharashtra government till May 1. While street vendors selling essential items such as vegetables and fruits are allowed to operate, local authorities asked them to wrap up early as the stalls got crowded. Mumbai Police and Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation ward staff were seen patrolling the areas throughout Thursday, asking shopkeepers to down shutters if norms were violated. Mahtab Alam, a vegetable street vendor from Dadar, said, “Around noon, the officials asked everyone to close business for the day. They have instructed us to work only till noon daily, for the next 15 days. Some vendors who did not listen to the police were asked to pay ₹1,200 fine.” Bharat Gogri, who owns a ready-made cloth store near Borivli station, tried to open half of his shop’s shutter at 9am on Thursday. Adjoining shopkeepers also tried the same. After some time, police personnel asked them to shut shop. Gogri and his fellow shopkeepers protested as hawkers continued to do business. “The state has allowed hawkers who do not pay tax or procure licences to operate while they are closing our legal shops,” said Gogri. Similar scenes were witnessed in the western suburbs of Malad, Kandivli and Goregaon. The latest ‘break the chain’ circular issued by the state empowers local authorities to take a call on restrictions in their areas for crowd control. The curbs have hit businesses of shop keepers and restaurateurs hard, with retail shop owners of Mumbai claiming a cumulative loss of ₹350 crore per day, and restaurateurs saying they are operating at 8% to 10% of their original income before the first phase of Covid-19 lockdown of March 2020. Amid the buzz over a lockdown, many labour and staff working at retail shops and restaurants left the city to return to their hometowns using inter-state public transport. As restaurants are allowed home delivery of food 24x7, some owners said they would remain open around-the-clock for online delivery. However, the business is bleak, they claim. Gurbaxish Singh Kohli, vice-president of Federation of Hotel and Restaurant Owners’ Association of India, said, “During the first phase of the lockdown last year, 30% of restaurants went out of business. Now, we are anticipating 30% more may go out of business if the restrictions extend for a considerable time. Most staff members have also left the city, so restaurants do not have the manpower to continue operating, let alone around-the-clock.” The wholesale markets of Zaveri Bazar, Kalbadevi and Mumbadevi saw scenes similar to the 2020 lockdown, as all shops were shut. Mumbai police commissioner Hemant Nagrale visited these places and praised the traders for adhering to the government’s diktat. Amid wedding season, many patrons who had given orders to make their jewellery faced anxious moments and were making frantic calls to the jewellers. “We have assured our clients that we will deliver their orders before the given deadline. We are committed to it despite this lockdown,” said Kumar Jain, president (Mumbai), Indian Bullion and Jewellers Association, a leading association of jewellers. At Zaveri Bazar wholesale market, at least 30,000 of the 300,000 workers have migrated back to their hometowns in the past few weeks. “We will wait for the next two days and see how the situation unfolds. We are fearing the virus,” said Rakesh Das, hailing from West Bengal and employed in the jewellery unit at Pydhonie. The handcarts, an essential for transporting goods in the wholesale markets, too, were lying unused. “There is not a single item to carry. I am wondering how long this lockdown will last. We managed last year somehow by taking loans, but this one will break our backs,” said Dhondiba Tarfe, a hand cart owner from Mangaldas market, a cloth market.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbaiites-stay-in-on-day-1-of-state-wide-restrictions-101618513451141.html

A notification to this effect was issued by special chief secretary (education) Chitra Ramachandran, following a high-level meeting convened by chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao earlier in the day. The decision of the Telangana government follows the notification issued by the Central Board of Secondary Education, which made a similar announcement on Wednesday. Ramachandran said all the class 10 examinations scheduled to be held from May 17 stood cancelled. The results of the Class 10 students would be announced on the basis of an objective criterion to be developed by the Telangana Board of Secondary School Certification at a later date. “Any candidate who is not satisfied with the marks allotted to him or her would be given an opportunity to sit in an exam which might be conducted as and when the conditions become conducive,” she said. Similarly, Ramachandran also announced that all the Intermediate second year (Class 12) examinations proposed to be held from May 1 to 19 were postponed indefinitely.“We shall hold a review in the first week of June to take a call on the future dates of examination. The students would be given at least 15 days’ notice before the examinations,” she said. Those Intermediate second students having backlogs would be given minimum passing marks only for the backlog subjects, she said. With regard to Intermediate first year (class 11), the special chief secretary said all the students would be promoted to the second year without examinations. “However, the government will consider conducting the examinations whenever it becomes possible at a future date,” she said. Ramachandran also announced that the 25 per cent weightage of intermediate marks hitherto given for deciding the ranks of students appearing for the engineering and agriculture entrance examinations would not be considered this year. As such, the rankings would be decided purely on the merit obtained in the entrance test. In the last 24 hours, Telangana reported 3307 new Covid-19 cases and eight deaths taking the overall tally of the positive cases to 338,045 and the death toll to 1,788, an official release by the Telangana medical and health department said.

BMC had earlier said cases would start to go down by April-end. The daily positivity rate in the city has gone down to 15%, from 26% earlier this month.However, owing to the increase in the number of cases in the state along with rise in demand for oxygen beds in Mumbai, BMC on Thursday said it would appoint six civic officials to act as coordinators between oxygen suppliers, assistant municipal commissioners of the 24 civic wards and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).The officials will be responsible for maintaining the existing oxygen supply and also ensuring that the same is used sparingly. There are around 150 private and government hospitals in the city treating Covid-19 patients.Municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal on Thursday said, “Although the daily number of patients in Mumbai has stabilised between 8,000 and 10,000 in the last 15 days, the next 15 days are even more important. Given the growing number of patients and the amount of oxygen they need, it is important to keep the supply system running smoothly. At present 235 metric tonnes of oxygen is being supplied to the hospitals in Mumbai, and in view of the increasing number of patients, more demand has been made to the government.”On Thursday, the city reported 8,209 cases and 50 deaths, taking tally to 553,404 and toll to 12,197. The city’s recovery rate stands at 82.27% with 455,293 recoveries. Fatality rate is 2.20% and there are 84,753 active cases in the city.Meanwhile, Dr Siddarth Paliwal, city-based physician, said, “It is likely that the burden on health infrastructure will drop marginally as the lockdown will help bring the cases under control. However, about the number of cases going down in the city, I feel we will need at least around 30 days to bring down the cases with the amount of testing we are conducting in the city.”He added, “Though cases might have stabilised and the daily positivity rate has gone down, I feel our testing is also stabilising between 45,000 and 55,000. We need to steadily increase our daily testing figure and aim for at least 65,000 to 80,000 tests daily.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/covid19-cases-have-stabilised-next-15-days-crucial-mumbai-civic-chief-101618512971673.html

Sharmila, who addressed an impressive public meeting at Khammam last week and announced the launch of a new political party in Telangana, took up a three-day “deeksha” (fast) at Dharna Chowk near Indira Park in the heart of the city in the morning, demanding that the government fill up 1.92 lakh job vacancies by the Telangana government. The Hyderabad police, however, gave her permission to observe the deeksha only for one day, since there would be large gathering of her followers at the Dharna Chowk which was not permissible under the Covid-19 rules. But Sharmila announced that she would continue her fast for three days, come what may. However, as the deadline came to an end at 5 pm, the Saifabad police came to her and asked her to wind up the deeksha. When she did not relent, the police pulled down the tent and foiled her plans, resulting in a clash between the police and her followers. An agitated Sharmila announced that she would go on foot from Indira Park to her Lotus Pond residence, which was about 10 km away, where, she said, she would continue her fast for the next two days. As she walked for a couple of kilometres along with hundreds of her followers and reached Telugu Talli flyover, the police obstructed her and declared that she had no permission to go in a procession to her house. When she insisted that she would take out the foot march, the police arrested her and shifted her to Begumpet women’s police station. Speaking to reporters at the police station, Sharmila said she would continue her fast wherever she was taken and there was no question of going back on her announcement for a 72-hour deeksha. “It is atrocious that the Telangana government has chosen to arrest a woman who has taken up the deeksha for a genuine cause,” she said. Addressing hundreds of people at the Dharna Chowk, Sharmila lashed out at the Telangana Rashtra Samithi government for not filling up job vacancies even after six years. She blamed it on chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao for a spate of suicides by the unemployed youth due to lack of job opportunities. “I will continue my struggle till the KCR government issues a notification for filling up of 1.92 lakh job vacancies in various departments, as mentioned in the Biswal Committee report,” Sharmila said. Several social activists, political leaders and youth leaders attended her deeksha. Prominent writer Kancha Ilaiah appreciated Sharmila for waging a war against the TRS government like Rudrama Devi of Kakatiya dynasty. “She has every right to launch a new political party in Telangana and fight for fulfilling the aspirations of the people. I am not surprised if she becomes the chief minister of Telangana one day,” he said. Former Telugu Desam Party lawmaker and All India BC Welfare Association president R Krishnaiah, too, extended her support to Sharmila, saying she has all the capabilities of becoming the chief minister of Telangana.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/police-detain-cm-jagan-s-sister-sharmila-over-protest-101618512911124.html
16-04-2021||Mumbai||Day 1 of curbs: Public transport services in Mumbai see less takers||With restriction of the new lockdown imposed in the city on Thursday, public transport witnessed a dip in the number of passengers. Mumbai local services, which was closed for general public except for those travelling for valid reason, saw significant decline commuters. By 8pm on Thursday, nearly 1.8 million passengers travelled by local trains on both Central and Western Railway. Earlier, around 2.2 million passengers travelled on Central Railway and 1.8 million passengers travelled on Western Railway daily, as restrictions were eased under the Maharashtra government’s Mission Begin Again. The Maharashtra government has not suspended public transport, but has implemented restrictions such as restricting general public from travelling by local trains. However, people working in essential care, travelling for medical purposes and those travelling to and fro vaccination centres across the city will be allowed to commute by the local trains. Autorickshaws are allowed to have two passengers only, excluding the driver; taxis are allowed to operate with 50% capacity and Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport (BEST) buses are not allowed to ferry any standing passengers.Railway authorities have also restricted entry and exit points of railway stations on Thursday and started checking identity cards and documents of passengers at the entrance of railway stations. The inspection was conducted during the evening rush hour. “We have started checking identity cards of people working in essential care and other documents of passengers while they enter the railway stations. If we find any unauthorised travel, we inform Government Railway Police (GRP) who are authorised to charge fines,” said a senior railway official. There was also a decrease in passengers travelling by BEST buses. “There was up to a 5% decrease in the number of passengers travelling by BEST buses. No passengers were allowed to stand. We will know the exact decline in the number of passengers by Friday,” said a senior BEST official.Further, citing loss in livelihood, autorickshaw union has approached e-commerce website Amazon asking to engage autorickshaw and taxi drivers to deliver products within and outside Mumbai. “We would be happy if Amazon can look into engaging services of autorickshaw and taxi drivers in Mumbai and outside to deliver their products. They can also deliver bigger quantity and bulkier products. This would enable the autorickshaw and taxi drivers to earn some income during these difficult times,” said Krishna Hegde, president, Kamgar Seva Sangh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/day-1-of-curbs-public-transport-services-in-mumbai-see-less-takers-101618512851078.html
16-04-2021||Other||Three arrested for abetting suicide of 26-year-old: Police||Bengaluru: Three men have been arrested for allegedly abetting a 26-year-old man to suicide by blackmailing him using intimate videos, Bengaluru Police said on Thursday.According to police, the body of the 26-year-old MBA graduate was found hanging at his residence near KR Puram on March 23. Police said that the man’s family could not ascertain the reason for suicide initially as they were not aware of any issues faced by him, neither did they find any note. Later, a message received by his sister from an unknown person pointed towards a possible case of extortion, police said. Police said the accused, identified as Kadeem, Robin and Javed, all residents of Bharatpur in Rajasthan, were arrested from their native place. Pointing that the accused were repeat offenders, investigators said Khadeem would create fake Facebook accounts in women’s name to lure men online. “He would send them a friend request and chat with them. During the chats, they would learn about the family background of their victims. Once they zeroed in on a target, they would then lure them for sex chats and video calls. They asked their victims to strip during the video calls and record them. These clips would then be used by the accused to blackmail their targets,” an investigating officer said, adding that the accused would take help of an unknown woman for video chat.Police said the same modus operandi was used in this case as well. “A Facebook friend request was sent to the 26-year-old by a stranger from a profile named after Neha Sharma,” the officer said. “He started chatting with the woman, who later made a video call to him. She removed her clothes and asked him to undress. What followed was recorded,” said the officer.Later, the gang extorted around ₹45,000 in multiple transactions from the man, threatening to release the video online and tell his family members about it, police said, adding that the continued harassment pushed the 26-year-old to take the extreme step. Meanwhile, on April 3, the deceased’s sister received a message from an unknown man on Facebook, which said that her brother had borrowed ₹21,000 from him, police said. She received another message from one Neha Sharma, asking if she was related to the victim. Finding the messages suspicious, she gave Neha Sharma her nephew’s number, claiming it to be of the victim. During the chats, they told the nephew, who they thought was the deceased, that with a one-time settlement of ₹21,000, the case could be closed, police said. The family then approached the police after realising that the 26-year-old was being blackmailed.Police have booked the three for abetment to suicide and cheating under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code and sections of Information Technology Act.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/three-arrested-for-abetting-suicide-of-26-year-old-police-101618512791091.html
16-04-2021||Other||10,497 new cases in B’luru, HC calls for crack down||Bengaluru The Karnataka High Court on Thursday directed the state Director General of Police (DGP) to form committees and monitor action being taken against political leaders and celebrities violating Covid-19 protocols like wearing of masks and maintaining social distance, according to two persons aware of the developments. “We had brought to the court’s notice that lockdown norms are being violated more by celebrities and political leaders and no action is being taken against them. They have been virtually saved,” said Puthige R Ramesh, the advocate appearing on behalf of Letzkit Foundation, who filed the case. The court also observed that no one should be spared for violating safety protocols, the advocate added. The direction of the court comes at a time when Karnataka has been registering record Covid-19 cases, indicating that the health crisis in the southern state and its capital Bengaluru was spiraling wildly out of control. Bengaluru breached the five-figure mark for the first time as it reported 10,497 cases on Thursday, taking its active case count 71,827. The city accounted for 30 of the 66 fatalities reported across the state on Thursday. The overall toll in the state to 13,112. Karnataka reported 14,738 new infections, taking the active case count closer to the 100,000-mark at 96,561. The state had previously reported its biggest single-day spike of 11,265 cases on Wednesday.Among 66 deaths reported on Thursday, 30 are from Bengaluru Urban, Ballari and Bengaluru Rural (6), Mysuru (5), Hassan (4), Dharwad (3), Bidar, Tumakuru and Uttara Kannada (2), and one each from Belagavi, Kalaburagi, Kolar, Ramanagara, Shivamogga and Vijayapura.Among the districts where the new cases were reported, Bengaluru Urban accounted for 10,497, Kalaburagi 624, Tumakuru 387, Bidar 363, Mysuru 327, Mandya 211, Ballari 200, followed by others.Political leaders, including chief minister BS Yediyurappa, have been seen in public places with no masks and no semblance of social distancing. All three political parties -- Bharatiya Janata Party, Congress and the Janata Dal (Secular) -- have been campaigning in Belagavi, Basavakalyan and Maski constituencies ahead of the April 17 bypolls, addressing large gatherings of people, which experts said, was one of the main reasons for spreading of the infection in these districts. The high court was hearing a plea by Letzkit Foundation, which sought strict implementation of Covid-19 norms in the state and Bengaluru, which accounts for around 70% of all cases being reported in Karnataka. Yediyurappa has said that there will be stricter action taken against violators “after the elections”, making it convenient for political parties to continue campaigning. The campaigning ended on Thursday and the polls are on Saturday in the three constituencies. “We have furnished all the photographs where all the violations are taking place by political leaders and film stars,” GR Mohan, an advocate who has filed an impleading application with the same prayer, said. He added that the court was also informed that the government decided to increase seating capacity (in cinema halls?) from 50% to 100% at the request of just one actor (Puneet Rajkumar). The Karnataka government has put in effect a ‘night curfew’ from April 10 to 20 in seven districts, including Bengaluru. The state government has ruled out a lockdown as it fears the economic impact on the already fledgling finances of the state, according to ministers, legislators and experts. However, the lack of hospital beds, especially for critically ill patients, has added to the challenges of the Yediyurappa-led state government. There are just over 30 intensive care unit (ICU) beds and those with ventilators in all of Bengaluru, according to Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike data, which the HT reported on Wednesday. Almost 70% of all hospital beds (private and government) are full in Bengaluru, which has stressed the city’s healthcare system amid a raging pandemic. “Private hospitals have been requested to reserve 50% of beds for Covid patients. But private hospitals have reserved only 15-20% of what has been asked for. Government will consider it as a serious lapse. Strict measures will be initiated if they do not follow the government orders,” K Sudhakar, Karnataka’s health & family welfare and medical education minister said on Thursday. He added that only critical non-Covid patients who need hospitalisation should be treated in hospitals. “Government cannot keep quiet if Covid patients are denied treatment,” Sudhakar said. The government has also sought a report from the Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) on increasing Covid-19 cases and containment measures. “The report will be handed over to the CM and he will take the decision after a detailed discussion with leaders in the all-party meeting and cabinet colleagues,” Sudhakar added.

16-04-2021||Pune||Covid impact: Eateries, food stalls feel the pinch in Pune||PUNE Amid the strict restrictions imposed by the state government to curb the Covid cases, many roadside eateries and food stalls have opted to keep their stalls closed and only a few are providing parcel services by following the virus-appropriate norms.On Thursday, hardly three to four roadside eateries were operational and provided parcel service in the peth area near Shaniwarwada, which usually attracts students, visitors, people working in nearby offices among others.Nitin Gaikwad, the owner of Shri Krishna Snacks near Saniwarwada, said, “My business has been affected, I hardly earn ₹400 daily, as compared to my regular income of ₹800. Mostly, the regulars are students who hardly come these days.”Vinod Gautam, who works at a stall “Shivam Dosa,” said, “During summer, families and students usually visit Saniwarwada and the business used to be at the peak. But the situation is different due to the pandemic. The government has allowed us to operate the business for parcel service, but there are hardly any customers.”Sai Pav Bhaji had some late diners from nearby offices. “These couple of people are my first customers of the day. Usually, by 2 pm, I would have a lot of orders, but now I have around four orders. Since people cannot stand and eat here and we have to parcel this, it is tough for them too,” said Milind Thopte, owner of Sai Pav Bhaji.Jagdish Patil, who works for a finance company nearby, said, “At least we are getting to eat even if it means to take a parcel to office. Last year it was tough during the lockdown and we had to rely on expensive restaurants.”While in Sadashiv peth, the “khau galli” is bereft of the usual crowd except for some people sitting on the steps of the shops on the opposite side of the eateries.“I was not aware that we have to do the Covid test. I will get it done tomorrow,” said one of the young employees of Bholenath tea stall. “Right now we are giving parcel only,” he said.Some of the stall owners have got themselves vaccinated from private hospitals just to open their business. Like Prithviraj Choudhary running the “Davangiri dosa” stall. “I went to a private hospital and got myself vaccinated. Only if I run my stall will I make money. There is hardly any public, but we are hoping that we can make some money to feed our family,” he said.Sagar Joshi, an employee of a bank, had to take his plate of dosa and eat in his car. “I live alone and there is no time to go to a mess and collect food. We are working on less staff hence there is a heavy workload. So the best is to come to these stalls, buy the food and eat it inside the vehicle,” said Joshi.Sachin Anda Bhurji at Balgandharva bridge run by Sachin Ingale is one of the famous spots for everyone to eat piping hot “burji”, but today (on Thursday), he waits eagerly to see customers. “I got vaccinated and only then came to open my stall. Since morning I have got only four orders. I have also advertised on my stall that I have started delivery up to a 3 km radius, using my resources. If one has to survive then I will have to use my savings to make it through this lockdown.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/covid-impact-eateries-food-stalls-feel-the-pinch-101618504270071.html
16-04-2021||Delhi||Two to a bed in Delhi hospital as Covid-19 crisis spirals||Gasping for air, two men wearing oxygen masks share a bed in a government hospital in India's capital New Delhi, victims of the country's growing Covid-19 crisis.From reporting under 10,000 new daily cases earlier this year, daily infections crossed 200,000 on Thursday, according to official data, the highest anywhere in the world.At Lok Nayak Jai Prakash Narayan Hospital (LNJP), one of India's largest Covid-only facilities with more than 1,500 beds, a stream of ambulances ferried patients to the overflowing casualty ward on Thursday.Also watch: Covid patients share bed at Delhi’s LNJP hospital amid surge in casesSome also arrived in buses and three-wheeled autorickshaws.The youngest patient was a new-born baby."We are definitely over-burdened. We are already working at full capacity," said the hospital's medical director, Suresh Kumar.From an initial 54 beds, the hospital now has over 300 for Covid-19 patients in critical condition. Even that is not enough.Unrelated patients share beds, while bodies of the recently deceased lie outside the ward before being taken to the mortuary."Today we have 158 admissions in Lok Nayak alone," Kumar said. Almost all were severe cases.After imposing one of the world's strictest lockdowns for nearly three months last year, India's government relaxed almost all curbs by the beginning of 2021, although many regions have now introduced localised restrictions.LNJP's Kumar said fast-spreading new variants that evade testing were adding to the burden, as was human behaviour as the country reopened."People are not following the Covid guidelines," he said. "They are just careless."Outside the hospital's mortuary, weeping relatives gathered in the hot sun to wait for the bodies of loved ones to be released.Prashant Mehra, 40, said he had to pay a broker for preferential treatment before he could get his 90-year-old grandfather admitted to the hospital. The hospital did not immediately respond to a request for comment on his remarks.Mehra said the effort made little difference in the end."He died after six or seven hours," he said. "We already asked for our money back."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/two-to-a-bed-in-delhi-hospital-as-covid-19-crisis-spirals-101618502635962.html

Anita Gosavi, 41, had ferried the deceased from Pimpri-Chinchwad area to Kondhwa, covering a distance of about 23 km, alone. Javed Khan, a volunteer of the group, said, “We reached the Kausar Baug Kabrastan at midnight after receiving a message that a body will arrive for burial. It was a shock for us to see a woman at the wheel of the ambulance. We salute Anita for her dedication and bravery. We have never seen a woman driving an ambulance for Covid victims as we have been performing the last rites of those who died of the virus since the outbreak last year.” Anita, a resident of Pimpri-Chinchwad, said, “I am driving a ambulance since last September when my brother, who is an ambulance driver, tested positive for Covid. As he was not getting a driver, I offered to fill his place. Though my parents were against the decision, my brother convinced them.” “Whenever I get a call, I rush to hospitals to either pick up a Covid patient or body. I have ferried bodies alone at night many times. The situation is bad. Few days ago, I picked up a 23-year-old woman who was infected by the virus. Along with the patient and her parents, I was running from one hospital to another in search of a bed till 6 am. Finally, Yashwantrao Chavan Medical hospital in Pimpri promised to give a bed at 8 am. So, her parents requested me to drop them at home. I dropped them at home and got a call at 7 am that the patient has passed away.” About the fear of carrying bodies in ambulance alone at nights, Anita said, “I am not afraid to doing this work. Earlier, I was working as a school bus assistant. I was passionate about driving, and requested the bus driver uncle to teach me. The uncle taught me to drive and later I became a school bus driver before the lockdown left me jobless. I started vegetable business, but my parents asked me to shut shop.” Anita again took to wheels after her brother went into quarantine. When the second wave of Covid started, she began the service under the name of Savitri Ambulance. “I might be the first ambulance driver for Covid service, but am not sure. My daughter is pursuing doctorate at a renowned institute and son is a diploma holder. They have allowed me to do the work, but always tell me to follow all preventive norms.” A native of Jamkhed taluka in Ahmednagar district, Anita was brought up at Pimplekher village before shifting to Akluj after marriage. “When kids grew up, we shifted to Pune for their better education,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/woman-mans-ambulance-wheels-to-ferry-covid-victims-for-burial-in-pune-even-at-nights-101618501810476.html
16-04-2021||Pune||PMC launches app for Covid patients in home isolation||The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has launched an android-based application for Covid positive patients who have opted for home isolation.PMC home isolation app will give patients a direct channel to communicate with PMC about their daily well being and raise an alert in case of any emergency, said officials.Citizens need to download the app from Google Play Store app or from the link https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.technopurple.pmc.activity.homeisolationSatya Muley, an advocate and one of the volunteers who is helping people download this app, said, “Many people are opting for home isolation, especially those asymptomatic. These people should download the app. This will also help the PMC to tackle and monitor the growing numbers.”The app is designed to capture patient’s home location and digitise the daily health assessment checks. It helps in alerting authorities about patients who need immediate attention based on captured health parameters.The patient needs to register and make sure that all permissions are allowed for the app to work successfully in real-time.The guidelines to the app specify that patients opting for this app should not change phone settings and internet connectivity needs to be on for 17 days until the end of the quarantine period. A user guide via video is available in the app in Hindi, Marathi and English languages.To enrol on this app, the patient needs to be at home location to start the enrolment procedure, where all the details of the patient including the RT-PCR should be entered. In case multiple members in the family are Covid positive and in the same home isolation, they need to download and register from their phone. If a separate phone is not available then multiple patients can be enrolled in the same phone using the add button.It is important and required for the patient to submit a daily self-assessment form each day for 17 days of the quarantine period. Patients have to submit daily self-assessment form mandatorily before 3 pm, if not done so then the patient will receive a call from PMC staff.The app also suggests submitting an emergency form only if you in an emergency and need help from PMC.

16-04-2021||Pune||Pune dist needs to step up Covid testing, say experts||With the Covid tally rising, health experts have pointed out the need to increase testing. Many labs and hospitals are delaying test reports, claim patients.Gajanan More, a resident of Kothrud said that on Thursday, he went to several labs for testing, but all of them said that the reports will come late. “I went to private hospitals for testing and they said that the reports will come in four days. After which I went to a private lab, they said that the kits are over and they can send a person to take a sample by the next day,” said More.In the Pune district, between April 1 and April 7 as many as 1,50,365 tests were conducted, while from April 8- April 14 as many as 1,96,778 tests were conducted, according to the district administration. In Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) limits, meanwhile, between April 1 and April 7 at least 1,40,823 tests were conducted and from April 8- April 14, at least 1,66,815 tests were conducted.Ayush Prasad, chief executive officer (CEO) of Zilla Parishad said, 35,000 antigen kits would be given to 234 hotspots in rural Pune for mass testing in the next three days (from April 15).“We are hoping to get more people tested in Pune rural to ensure that good medical care is given to them and there is no further spread. Till April 17, we will be mass testing every person of each household who frequently goes out for work. This will help isolate and treat various patients at the early stage avoiding complications and further reducing death rate,” he said.Dr Vichar Nigam, Internal Medicine, consultant physician and diabetes specialist, Columbia Asia hospital, said that at a 40 per cent positivity rate, this is certainly one of the worst Covid waves the city has ever seen, owing to unregulated gatherings, and complete disregard of Covid safety norms.“We did not learn any lessons from the spike in cases that happened after festive celebrations last year. Few things are different this time. So far, the death rate is lower than last time. More deaths are reported in people above 60 years of age and with comorbidities. Approximately one-third of the infected patients are in their 20s and 30s which is more than last time,” said Dr Nigam.He added that instead of individuals, we are seeing entire families getting infected, which possibly indicates that the virus or its mutant strain that is causing the infection is less virulent, but more transmissible.“There is an urgent need to check the increasing number of infections to ensure that the healthcare providers can offer services to the more critical patients. Besides, every step must be taken to continue the current pace of vaccination, and try to speed it up so that more people are covered within a shorter period. Besides, public campaigns must be planned to increase awareness about the importance of Covid protocols and vaccine hesitancy,” said Dr Nigam.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pune-dist-needs-to-step-up-covid-testing-say-experts-101618496469301.html
16-04-2021||Delhi||Capital tightens curbs as cases spiral out of control||The Delhi government on Thursday shut malls, gyms, restaurants, reduced capacity at cinemas until April 30, and clamped a curfew on movement and assembly of people this weekend, as part of its efforts to arrest surging coronavirus infections that threaten to overrun the health infrastructure in the city with India’s worst outbreak.Malls, gymnasiums, spas, assembly halls, entertainment parks and auditoriums will be shut, dine-in facilities at restaurants in the city will be barred, and cinemas will be allowed to function at 30% capacity, said an order by the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA).Only one weekly market per day per zone in municipal zones will be allowed, subject to compliance of Covid-19 protocols. Essential service workers and people out for emergencies, outstation travel or weddings will be allowed, said the order.The weekend curfew will be in place between 10pm on Friday and 5am on Monday.“On weekdays, people have to earn their livelihood. But on the weekend, people go out for entertainment and other activities, which can be curtailed. Hence, to break the chain of infections, we are imposing a weekend curfew,” said Kejriwal, an hour after meeting lieutenant governor Anil Baijal on the Capital’s coronavirus situation.A post shared by Hindustan Times (@hindustantimes)The CM, however, said that the situation will be monitored closely, and the curbs could be extended beyond April 30, and the curfew could also be imposed on following weekends, if needed. “People should not think of it as an inconvenience for them. It is in fact for their own safety,” he added. He sought to allay fears that the Capital was out of hospital beds but asked citizens to not be choosy about where to get admitted.The announcement comes a day after the city logged its highest one-day Covid-19 spike at 17,282 on Wednesday. The test positivity rate – a ratio of the number of positive cases to total tests conducted, and a measure of the scale of an outbreak in the region – has shot up from 0.59% a month ago, to 20.2% on Thursday – the highest in since June 26. Since April 1, the seven-day average of daily infections have shot up 590% and the city now has 54,309 active cases. The weekend curfew comes on top of 10pm-5am night curfew restrictions that are in place until April 30. On Thursday, the city logged 16,699 cases but the positivity rate soared to 20.22% because of lower testing the previous day as it was a public holiday. Over the weekend, restaurants will be allowed to do home deliveries and only establishments selling essential goods such as medicines, grocery or food items will be open. This means that regular markets will be open during the week, but will be shut this weekend, barring shops selling medicines or groceries. Cinemas will also be shut this weekend because only essential workers are allowed to travel.Government and judicial officials, diplomats, journalists and doctors will be allowed to travel this weekend on production of a valid identity card. People coming from or going to airports, railway stations or interstate bus terminals will be allowed on production of a valid ticket. But all other workers -- grocery shop staff, internet workers, bank staff, delivery personnel, petrol pump workers, private security staff, among others -- and people going for Covid-19 vaccination will need to show a valid curfew pass to be allowed to travel. People feeling sick, going for a Covid-19 test or in medical emergencies will be allowed.These passes will be available online on www.delhi.gov.in. A senior official said passes issued for the night curfew will be valid for movement during this weekend.“We will not allow any inconvenience to those involved in essential services like going to hospitals, railway stations or airports and also weddings. We will issue passes for their movement quickly and without harassment,” Kejriwal said.He added that steps will be taken to control crowds in all markets and public places. The government will also ensure a strict enforcement of Covd-appropriate behaviour such as wearing masks.Public transport such as Delhi Metro and DTC and cluster buses will operate during the weekend but won’t allow the general public. Only essential workers will be allowed to board. The same will hold true for cabs or auto-rickshaws during the weekend.The government allowed weddings to go ahead.“This is the wedding season and many people’s weddings are also scheduled, and all preparations done. We don’t want to inconvenience them. We will allow their movement with curfew passes and they will be provided the same without any harassment,” Kejriwal said.Under existing curbs, weddings can allow a maximum of 50 guests and funerals 20 guests.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/capital-tightens-curbs-as-cases-spiral-out-of-control-101618475999301.html

Pawar was speaking at the campaign rally for Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) nominee Bhagirath Bhalke.The event was attended by at least 100 persons in a packed auditorium in Pandharpur. During the programme, local leader Kalyan Kale joined the NCP. While Pawar himself had a mask on his face, many among the audience did not have masks, a violation of the rule.While there was no case registered till evening, Arun Pawar, senior police inspector, Pandhapur police station, said that observers appointed by the tehsildar office will register a case of Covid-19 norms violation after going through all details.When asked, Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope was cautious in his reaction, saying that everyone needs to follow Covid norms in view of the current situation.“There are elections in Pandharpur where Ajit Pawar addressed a meeting. Pawar is a senior leader and will not flout any norms on his own. There are times when it becomes difficult to control the crowd. However, I would like to reiterate that everyone needs to follow the Covid norms,” Tope said, speaking at press conference in Mumbai.Earlier on March 22, local police booked an NCP functionary for alleged Covid-19 violations while organising a political event, which was also attended Ajit Pawar.The event was held in Pandharpur and despite permission for 50 attendees, the crowd for the event was much larger.Later, a case was registered against Sandip Mandave, president of NCP’s Pandharpur-Mangalvedha assembly seat, under section 188 of IPC.NCP’s Bhalke, son of former MLA Bharat Bhalke, is its candidate for Pandharpur, and is pitted against BJP’s Samadhan Autade. The bypolls were necessitated for the Pandharpur-Mangalwedha seat after the demise of three- term NCP legislator Bharat Bhelke, in the last week of November||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ajit-pawar-addresses-poll-rally-in-pandharpur-where-covid-norms-ignored-101617899506736.html
16-04-2021||World||US says Russia was given Trump campaign polling data in 2016||It was one of the more tantalising, yet unresolved, questions of the investigation into possible connections between Russia and Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign: Why was a business associate of campaign chairman Paul Manafort given internal polling data — and what did he do with it?A Treasury Department statement Thursday offered a potentially significant clue, asserting that Konstantin Kilimnik, a Russian and Ukrainian political consultant, had shared sensitive campaign and polling information with Russian intelligence services.Kilimnik has long been alleged by US officials to have ties to Russian intelligence. But the statement in a broader Treasury Department sanctions announcement was the first time the US government had so directly drawn a connection from the Trump campaign to the Kremlin's intelligence services.The revelation was all the more startling because it went beyond any allegation made in either special counsel Robert Mueller's 2019 report or in an even more damning and detailed document released last year by the Senate Intelligence Committee.Both those investigations were unable to determine what Kilimnik did with the data and whether he shared it further.The issue resurfaced Thursday because Kilimnik was one of 32 people and entities sanctioned by the US government for interference in the 2020 election.Officials say Kilimnik sought to promote the bogus narrative that Ukraine, not Russia, had interfered in the 2016 election.Kilimnik was a key but mysterious figure in Mueller's investigation into potential coordination between Russia and the 2016 Trump campaign.A business associate of Manafort's who worked closely with him, even managing his firm's office in Kyiv, Kilimnik is mentioned by name 156 times in the Mueller report.He was also indicted alongside Manafort on witness tampering allegations, but has not appeared in the US to face those charges.The FBI has issued a USD 250,000 award for information leading to his arrest.A key episode examined by Mueller involved Manafort's decision to share campaign polling data with Kilimnik — something prosecutors say Manafort lied about when questioned. Investigators scrutinized a series of secretive encounters between the men, including one in August 2016 at the Grand Havana Club in New York.There, according to statements provided by Mueller, Manafort briefed Kilimnik on internal campaign data and messaging and they discussed battleground states.The exchange of polling data was an eye-catching data point, especially since it suggested Russia could have exploited such inside information to target influence campaigns aimed at boosting Trump's election bid in 2016.But Mueller's team said it couldn't “reliably determine” Manafort's purpose in sharing it, nor assess what Kilimnik may have done with it — in part due to questions over Manafort's credibility.The Senate committee also came up empty, though its report drew attention for its characterization of Kilimnik as a Russian intelligence officer.It was not clear what new information, if any, led to the Treasury Department's assessment that Kilimnik had “provided the Russian Intelligence Services with sensitive information on polling and campaign strategy.” A Treasury Department spokesman did not return an email seeking comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-says-russia-was-given-donald-trump-campaign-polling-data-in-2016-101618593428410.html

He pleaded guilty in a deal with prosecutors in federal court in Washington to two counts: obstruction of an official proceeding, and entering and remaining in a restricted building with a dangerous or deadly weapon.An email seeking comment was sent to an attorney for Schaffer.Schaffer is among more than 370 people facing federal charges in the deadly insurrection, which sent lawmakers into hiding and delayed the certification of Biden's win. The Justice Department has indicated it is in separate plea negotiations with other defendants.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/heavy-metal-guitarist-1st-suspect-to-plead-guilty-in-capitol-riot-101618592018162.html
16-04-2021||World||Maldives seeks renewal of annual quotas of essential items from India||Maldives foreign minister Abdulla Shahid on Friday asked the Indian government to renew quotas for essential commodities in line with the bilateral trade agreement of 1981, people familiar with the developments said. The matter figured in Shahid’s meeting with his Indian counterpart S Jaishankar in New Delhi. The two ministers discussed bilateral, regional and global issues of mutual interest and Indian assistance to help the Maldives cope with the Covid-19 pandemic, the people cited above said on condition of anonymity. “Shahid requested the Indian side for renewal of Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) notifications regarding assured supply of essential commodities to the Maldives from India according to the bilateral trade agreement,” said one of the people cited above. Jaishankar assured Shahid that the Indian commitment would be honoured, the people said. Every year, the Indian government makes quota allocations for supplying essential commodities to the Maldives. Since the Maldives is almost completely dependent on imports, these quotas provide certainty and price stability for the Indian Ocean archipelago. Last year, the quotas set by India were the highest ever since the agreement was signed. The Maldives, along with Bangladesh, occupied a special place in India’s “Neighbourhood First” policy and has benefited from grants and lines of credit for development and infrastructure projects. It was also among the first countries to benefit from grants under the Vaccine Maitri initiative. The two ministers reviewed ongoing India-aided projects in the Maldives. India is currently developing projects worth $2 billion, including major infrastructure schemes for ports, roads, bridges, water and sanitation, and socio-economic development. A growing number of Indian tourists have visited the Maldives this year, aiding the archipelago’s economy in difficult times. Under a bilateral air bubble arrangement, India is the number one tourist market for the Maldives, and Indian travellers currently account for 23% of international tourist arrivals. As part of his two-day visit to India, Shahid also participated in the Raisina Dialogue through the virtual mode. His trip to New Delhi came in the wake of Jaishankar’s visit to the Maldives in February. Jaishankar also reaffirmed India’s support for Shahid’s candidacy as the president of the 76th UN General Assembly. The ministers also discussed cooperation at international forums such as the UN, Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, Commonwealth and South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/maldives-seeks-renewal-of-annual-quotas-of-essential-items-from-india-101618591816295.html
16-04-2021||World||Russia to expel 10 US diplomats in response to sanctions by Biden administration||Russia on Friday responded in kind to a barrage of new U.S. sanctions, saying it would expel 10 U.S. diplomats and take other retaliatory moves in a tense showdown with Washington.Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov also said Moscow will add eight U.S. officials to its sanctions list and move to restrict and stop the activities of U.S. nongovernment organizations from interfering in Russia’s politics.He said the Kremlin suggested that U.S. Ambassador John Sullivan follow the example of his Russian counterpart and head home for consultations. Russia will also move to deny the U.S. Embassy the possibility to hire personnel from Russia and third countries as support staff.The moves follow the sanctions on Russia announced this week by the Biden administration.While the U.S. wields the power to cripple the Russian economy, Moscow lacks levers to respond in kind, although it potentially could hurt American interests in many other ways around the globe.Lavrov noted that while Russia could take “painful measures” against American business interests in Russia, it wouldn’t immediately move to do thatRussia has denied interfering in the 2020 U.S. presidential election and involvement in the SolarWind hack of federal agencies — the activities punished by the latest U.S. sanctions. The Russian Foreign Ministry warned of an “inevitable” retaliation, charging that “Washington should realize that it will have to pay a price for the degradation of bilateral ties.”The U.S. on Thursday ordered 10 Russian diplomats expelled, targeted dozens of companies and people, and imposed new curbs on Russia's ability to borrow money. Pundits had predicted that while Moscow would respond in kind to the expulsions, it would refrain from any other significant moves to avoid a further escalation.Russia's economic potential and its global reach are limited compared with the Soviet Union that competed with the U.S for international influence during the Cold War. Still, Russia's nuclear arsenal and its leverage in many parts of the world make it a power that Washington needs to reckon with.Aware of that, President Joe Biden called for de-escalating tensions and held the door open for cooperation with Russia in certain areas. Biden said he told Putin in Tuesday's call that he chose not to impose tougher sanctions for now and proposed to meet in a third country in the summer.Lavrov said the summit offer was being analyzed.While the new U.S. sanctions further limited Russia’s ability to borrow money by banning U.S. financial institutions from buying Russian government bonds directly from state institutions, they didn't target the secondary market.“It’s very important that there’re no sanctions on secondary debt because that means that non-U.S. persons can buy the debt and sell it to the U.S. persons,” said Tom Adshead, director of research at Macro-Advisory Ltd, an analytics and advisory company.Tougher restrictions would also hurt Western businesses, inflict significant economic pain on the Russian population and allow Putin to rally anti-U.S. sentiments to shore up his rule.Ramping up sanctions could eventually drive Russia into a corner and provoke even more reckless Kremlin action, such as a potential escalation in Ukraine, which has recently faced a surge in clashes with Russia-backed separatists in the east and a massive Russian troops buildup across the border.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was in Paris on Friday to discuss the tensions with French President Emmanuel Macron. German Chancellor Angela Merkel was to join them in a call later.Fyodor Lukyanov, a top foreign policy expert who leads the Moscow-based Council for Foreign and Defense Policies, predicted Putin would likely accept Biden's invitation to join next week’s call on climate change but could drag his feet on accepting the summit offer.“There is no way to make any deals,” Lukyanov said. “There is a mutual antipathy and a total lack of trust.”He charged that the only practical outcome of the summit could be an agreement to launch long and difficult talks on a replacement to the New START nuclear reduction agreement that Russia and the U.S. extended in February for another five years.Lukyanov noted that the growing U.S. pressure will push Russia and China closer together in the long run.“Closer cooperation with China on coordinating actions to contain the United States will develop more quickly now as the Chinese are interested in that,” he said. While Russia lacks tools for a symmetrical answer to the U.S. sanctions, “it has ample capabilities to stimulate changes in the world order,” he added.Konstantin Kosachev, the Kremlin-connected deputy speaker of the upper house of parliament, said that by hitting Russia with sanctions and proposing a summit at the same time, the U.S. sought to take a commanding stance.“Russia's consent would be interpreted as a reflection of its desire to soften the sanctions, allowing the U.S. to secure a dominant position at the meeting, while our refusal to meet would be a convenient pretext for more punitive measures," Kosachev wrote on Facebook.He argued that Russia should not rush to accept Biden's summit offer.“Revenge is a dish best served cold,” Kosachev wrote. “I believe the saying is quite adaptable to a situation when we talk not about revenge but a due answer to aggressive action by an opponent.”Some predicted the U.S. sanctions could discourage Russia from cooperating with the U.S. on international crises.“The Russian position will grow tougher on Syria, the Iranian nuclear deal and other issues,” Ivan Timofeev, program director at Russian International Affairs Council, said in a commentary. Instead of acting as a deterrent, he warned, the sanctions would “only anger Russia and make its policy even tougher.”However, any attempt by Russia to undermine American interests would dangerously escalate tensions with the U.S. and trigger even harder sanctions — something the Kremlin certainly wants to avoid.Despite the soaring tensions, Russia and the U.S. have shared interests in many global hot spots. For example, Moscow fears that instability could spread from Afghanistan to former Soviet republics in Central Asia, and it is interested in a political settlement there.As for Iran, Moscow also doesn't want to see it with nuclear weapons, despite its friendly ties with Tehran.Lukyanov said that Russia wouldn't try to use global hot spots to hurt the U.S. and would wait patiently to see them erode U.S. domination.“It's not a matter of playing the spoiler here or there,” he said. “The ongoing developments will help accelerate the process of consolidation of leading powers against the U.S. domination.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-to-expel-10-american-diplomats-in-response-to-us-sanctions-101618589458996.html

16-04-2021||World||India, Afghanistan criticise Pakistan for backing Taliban, meddling in Afghan affairs||Pakistan’s role in backing the Taliban and meddling in Afghanistan was criticised on Friday by external affairs minister S Jaishankar and Afghan National Security Adviser Hamdullah Mohib, who said democratic and constitutional structures created in the war-torn country must be preserved. Without naming Pakistan, both Jaishankar and Mohib referred to the negative role of a “neighbour” of Afghanistan while participating in a virtual discussion at the Raisina Dialogue. However, their remarks left no one in doubt as to which country they were talking about. Iranian foreign minister Javad Zarif, who also participated in the discussion, was more circumspect but urged the Taliban to join negotiations aimed at ensuring a peaceful and stable Afghanistan. Jaishankar noted that thousands of foreign fighters are still in Afghanistan and said all stakeholders should buy into a fair and broad-based process aimed at ensuring lasting peace in Afghanistan. The resolution in Afghanistan must be supported by all its neighbours and cannot be based solely on “the wishes of the most forceful set of people in that society”, he said. “The neighbours of Afghanistan unfortunately have very often played a very negative role...The neighbours also need to lay off Afghanistan and let the Afghan people do what is in their best interest,” Jaishankar said. Mohib endorsed Jaishankar’s comments about the presence of foreign fighters and said: “It’s not just the withdrawal of foreign troops from Afghanistan, it’s also the withdrawal of foreign fighters from Afghanistan, [whom] the Taliban are working closely with and who are involved in destructive activities in our country and...will remain a threat to the region.” He said everything alleged about the Taliban’s links with a neighbouring country had “become a clear reality” over the past 18 months following the visit of Taliban leaders to their injured fighters and their public discussions. “Any further push would mean that there is direct involvement in Afghanistan by a neighbour, which could be very dangerous. The nationalistic forces in Afghanistan are very upset and angry over this and if this limit is passed, I think there would be huge problems for the said neighbour, in their country by all Afghans who are there and from within Afghanistan,” Mohib said. “There could be a huge blowback effect that I think could be destructive for these neighbours,” he added. Jaishankar dismissed Pakistan’s narrative about being encircled by India and any India-friendly government in Kabul, saying New Delhi’s actions were only aimed at creating power infrastructure, dams, health clinics and roads. “This is actually an absolute fantasy that somewhere our very presence and our activities there are aimed at Pakistan. It completely ignores the feelings that we have for the Afghan people,” he said. Mohib pointed to the coordination between the Indian and Afghan governments, saying he had spoken to NSA Ajit Doval on Friday morning to assess the situation and to prepare for the dialogue with the Taliban. The Afghan side will put together a team to work with the US and NATO on a transition plan but all efforts will be aimed at ensuring a united, democratic and sovereign Afghanistan, he said. The discussion was held against the backdrop of US President Joe Biden’s announcement about the withdrawal of all American forces from Afghanistan by September to end their two-decade-long deployment. US secretary of state Antony Blinken visited Kabul on Thursday to discuss the transition with President Ashraf Ghani. The Taliban have said they won’t attend a meeting in Turkey this month to decide on Afghanistan’s future until all foreign forces leave the country. Taliban leaders have also spoken of their plans to restore the Islamic emirate they had created in the 1990s. However, Jaishankar, Mohib and Zarif ruled out the possibility of taking Afghanistan back to the era of the Taliban’s emirate and said all the gains made in the past two decades – including the rights of minorities and women, democratic structures and choosing representatives through elections – must be preserved. All three leaders acknowledged that the existing system in Afghanistan wasn’t perfect but said it was preferable to the Taliban’s plans to impose an Islamic system. “The Taliban have no reason to continue their violence in Afghanistan anymore...It’s time for them to make real peace with the Afghan government and become part of the mainstream political society,” Mohib said. Zarif said the Iranian government has had frank discussions with the Taliban to convince them of the need for a broad-based and inclusive peace in Afghanistan. The Taliban shouldn’t use the withdrawal of US troops as an opportunity to increase violence, he added. “We cannot create a vacuum, Taliban should not be asking for a vacuum. Taliban should start negotiating now with the government and people of Afghanistan, with various groups in Afghanistan,” Zarif said, adding a vacuum would draw in “fighting, violence and a civil war”....||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-afghanistan-criticise-pakistan-for-backing-taliban-meddling-in-afghan-affairs-101618586835936.html
16-04-2021||World||China's massed drills near Taiwan take aim at Washington audience||Chinese carrier drills and stepped-up incursions into Taiwan's air defence zone in recent weeks are meant to send a message to Washington to stand down and back off, security sources in Taipei say.The increased activity - which China, unusually, described as "combat drills" on Wednesday - has raised alarm in both Taipei and Washington, though security officials do not see it as a sign of an imminent attack.Rather, according to an official familiar with Taiwan's security planning, at least some of the exercises are practicing "access denial" manoeuvres to prevent foreign forces from coming to Taipei's defence in a war."China claimed that the drills are near Taiwan, but judging by their location it's actually meant for the U.S. military," said the official in Taiwan, speaking on condition of anonymity as he was not authorised to speak to the media.As China sailed an aircraft carrier group near Taiwan last week, its air force simulated attacks on American ships, although no U.S. Navy vessels were known to be in the area at the time, the source said.The U.S. Navy has been carrying out regular transits of the Taiwan Strait, which separates the island from China.One Western security source said the almost-daily flights by Chinese anti-submarine aircraft in the northernmost part of the South China Sea were probably a response to U.S. missions there, including by submarines, or to show the Pentagon that China can hunt for U.S. submarines."They are not chasing Taiwanese subs," the source said, pointing to Taiwan's own tiny fleet of four, two of which date from World War Two.The U.S. Navy does not give details of any submarine patrols near Taiwan or in the South China Sea.President Joe Biden's White House has maintained a tough-on-China stance inherited from the Trump administration. That has included more visible support for Taiwan, angering China, which considers the island part of its territory and sees Washington as giving succour to Taiwanese who seek independence, a red line for Beijing.Two U.S. military officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said that although the United States was concerned about Chinese activity around Taiwan, there was no sense of an imminent attack."For the past five years, China has been the centrepiece of the United States' national defence strategy. So of course we're concerned," one official said.China's Defence Ministry and the U.S. Navy's 7th Fleet did not respond to requests for comment.Taiwan's Defence Ministry said that it was keeping a close watch on "enemy movements" and that it has combat plans to deal with scenarios for a Chinese attack. It did not elaborate.'INESCAPABLE RESPONSIBILITY'Although China has escalated its rhetoric in response to U.S. warships passing through the Taiwan Strait, a U.S. defence official said Washington had not seen any kind of operational military escalation by the Chinese in response.In a statement to Reuters, China's Foreign Ministry said the United States has "swelled the arrogance of Taiwan independence forces".Washington "bears an inescapable responsibility for tensions in the Taiwan Strait", it added.A senior U.S. administration official said that regardless of who Beijing's incursions near Taiwan were aimed at, their effect was direct "intimidation and coercion" of Taiwan."Our operations there have been in a pretty steady state consistently," the official said. "So I don't think there's an increased pace of U.S. military operations that are necessarily driving what Beijing is doing. That feels a little bit like an excuse there for what they're doing."The U.S. Navy this month took the rare step of publishing a photo on its main website of a U.S. warship in the Philippine Sea watching China's Liaoning carrier.Raising the stakes, China's Navy said for the first time last week that carrier drills near Taiwan would become routine.Another U.S. warship sailed through the Taiwan Strait two days after China's announcement of its carrier manoeuvres, part of what the Pentagon refers to as "routine" transits that have prompted Beijing to accuse Washington of causing regional tensions."China's top concern in any Taiwan contingency would be preventing or at least blunting armed intervention by the U.S.", said Greg Poling, a maritime security expert at Washington's Center for Strategic and International Studies."So demonstrating increased ability to deny U.S. access is a coercive message sent to both Washington and Taipei."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinas-massed-drills-near-taiwan-take-aim-at-washington-audience-101618583588145.html

He created a podcast about the 1996 disappearance of college freshman Kristin Smart and it’s taken over his life.“I can’t step away from it for more than a few days,” Lambert said. “I just get sucked right back in because I want to be resolving things.”It was an unlikely turn for someone who refers to himself as a shy, “random boy with a beard” and it has produced results he never imagined.On Tuesday, as San Luis Obispo County Sheriff Ian Parkinson announced arrests, he credited Lambert with helping draw worldwide attention to the case and bringing forward several key witnesses.The longtime suspect, Paul Flores, and Smart were fellow freshmen at the California Polytechnic State University campus in San Luis Obispo. Now 44, Flores was charged with murder in the killing of the 19-year-old while trying to rape her in his dorm room, prosecutors said.His father, Ruben Flores, 80, was charged as an accessory after authorities said he helped hide the body, which has never been located.Paul Flores’ lawyer has declined to comment on the criminal charge. A lawyer for Ruben Flores said his client is innocent.Lambert has been thrust into the spotlight with the arrests. His eight-part series, “Your Own Backyard,” hit 7.5 million downloads Thursday and it was the No. 2 podcast on iTunes. Lambert’s phone has been blowing up with messages — from fans, tipsters and news reporters. He appreciates the attention but has been overwhelmed.“It’s driving me insane,” he said, yet he remained focused, patient and polite during a 45-minute interview with The Associated Press on Wednesday.All the attention isn’t leading to any money — Lambert takes no advertising for the podcast, relying on donations.His is the latest in a line of true-crime podcasts to play a role in an arrest, a court appeal or even an exoneration.“Up and Vanished” led a man to confess to killing a Georgia beauty queen, while “Serial” helped a convicted murderer win a new trial in Maryland. “In the Dark” unearthed new evidence in a case prosecutors dropped instead of seeking a seventh trial against a Mississippi man who spent decades on death row.Lambert, 33, was just 8 when Smart vanished a short drive up the coast from his own home in the small town of Orcutt, about 140 miles (225 kilometers) northwest of Los Angeles. It scared him that someone had gone missing and no one knew what happened.For more than two decades, a billboard featuring a photo of a grinning Smart advertised a $75,000 reward. It’s located in the town of Arroyo Grande. where Paul Flores grew up and his parents still live.Lambert passed it many times and it ultimately motivated him to start investigating.“I thought I’d give it a shot and see if I could get a few people talking,” Lambert said. “All I have to do is get over my shyness and start calling these people out of the blue and start asking really personal questions.”He bought some high-quality recording equipment and began making calls. He located overlooked or reluctant witnesses who hadn’t spoken with police, he said.People opened up to Lambert and he encouraged them to contact investigators with relevant information. Deputies started calling him to connect them with people he interviewed.“What Chris did with the podcast was put it out nationally to bring in new information,” Parkinson said without elaborating on the new evidence. “It did produce some information that I believe was valuable.”A former colleague of Paul Flores’ mother, Susan Flores, told him Mrs. Flores came into work after Memorial Day weekend 1996 — when Smart went missing — saying she didn’t sleep well because her husband had gotten a phone call in the middle of the night and left in his car.“The speculation has been all along that Paul called his dad in the middle of the night and his dad came up and helped him get rid of Kristin’s body,” Lambert said.A tenant who lived for a year at Susan Flores’ home told him she heard a watch alarm every morning at 4:20 a.m. Smart had worked as a lifeguard at 5 a.m. at the Cal Poly pool, so it’s possible she set her watch to wake up at that early hour.“That seems to be the moment in the podcast series that most people have been just completely shaken,” he said. “This may be the piece of evidence that points to the fact that Kristin was buried in that backyard or that her belongings were buried in that backyard.”Susan Flores, who hung up when called by the AP, told KSBY-TV in March in the only interview she’s granted that she could “shoot a lot of holes into a lot of (Lambert’s) lies.”She said Lambert never contacted her. He said he sent an intermediary to her house and Susan Flores threatened to call the police. His efforts to speak with Paul Flores were also fruitless, he said.Lambert spoke with a former Australian exchange student at Cal Poly who said he saw Flores and Smart struggling near where Smart was last seen. Lambert said investigators had dismissed that account in the early years of the probe.Lambert has developed a close relationship with the Smart family, who issued a statement after the arrest, praising his skills and “unselfish dedication.”He is grateful to have grown close to the family. He feels like he’s gotten to know Kristin Smart, but wishes he had the chance to meet her.“For most of my life, Kristin Smart has been a face on a billboard,” he wrote on Instagram. “I’ve learned about Kristin the daughter, Kristin the big sister, Kristin the friend, the neighbor, the roommate. Kristin the swimmer. Kristin the dreamer. And I’ve learned that you can miss a person you never even got to meet.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/shy-podcaster-helped-cops-solve-california-cold-case-killing-101618578672119.html
16-04-2021||World||Australia reports first blood clot death 'likely' due to AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine||Australia on Friday reported its first fatality from blood clots in a recipient of AstraZeneca's COVID-19 shot, and its regulator said there was a likely link between the 48-year-old woman's death and the vaccine.Hers was the third instance of the rare blood clots appearing in people who have been administered the vaccine in Australia. The other two are recovering well, the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) added.It said it was "carefully reviewing" similar instances in Australia.The New South Wales woman received the AstraZeneca vaccine on April 8, the day that the government announced that the Pfizer vaccine would be given as a preference to patients under 50, delaying its inoculation timetable.In the absence of an alternative cause for the clot that she developed, Australia's Vaccine Safety Investigation Group (VSIG) "believed that a causative link to vaccination should be assumed at this time," the TGA said.The VSIG had held a meeting late on Friday following news of the woman's death.The TGA said her case had been complicated by underlying medical conditions, including diabetes, "as well as some atypical features."There had been at least 885,000 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccines administered in Australia so far, equating to a frequency of instance of blood clot in every 295,000 cases, the TGA said."The overall number ...so far has been no higher than the expected background rate for the more common type of blood clots," it said.The UK regulator, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, has concluded from its review of cases reported in the UK that the overall risk of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis - a rare blood clot in the brain - was approximately 1 in 250,000 who receive the vaccine.Australia has reported over 22,000 COVID-19 cases of community transmission and 909 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australia-reports-first-blood-clot-death-likely-due-to-astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine-101618579588054.html
16-04-2021||World||With ‘folded hands’, Poonawalla urges Biden to lift export ban from these raw materials||Serum Institute of India (SII) chief executive Adar Poonawalla on Friday urged US President Joe Biden to lift the export ban on critical raw materials required for the production of vaccines against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). The United States in February invoked the Defense Production Act, which gives the power to control the distribution of products, to curb the export of raw materials critical for vaccine production.“Respected @POTUS, if we are to truly unite in beating this virus, on behalf of the vaccine industry outside the U.S., I humbly request you to lift the embargo of raw material exports out of the U.S. so that vaccine production can ramp up. Your administration has the details,” tweeted Poonawalla, adding a ‘folded hands’ emoji at the end.Respected @POTUS, if we are to truly unite in beating this virus, on behalf of the vaccine industry outside the U.S., I humbly request you to lift the embargo of raw material exports out of the U.S. so that vaccine production can ramp up. Your administration has the details. 🙏🙏Why did the US block the export of critical raw materials?In November last year, American pharmaceutical company Pfizer Inc. cut short its vaccine production target by half, citing a shortage of raw material. Pfizer, which is producing mRNA Covid-19 vaccines, had earlier planned to roll out over 1.2 billion shots in 2021 but reduced the target by half due to raw material shortage in the United States and Europe.The revised target was a major hindrance to Biden’s poll promise of administering 100 million vaccination shots in his first 100 days in office. The US government has purchased 600 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines from both Pfizer Inc. and Moderna Inc., which will be delivered in regular increments through the end of July 2021. In order to accelerate vaccine production, the Biden administration decided to invoke the Defense Production Act for the short term."We'll continue to use the Defense Production Act to expedite critical materials in vaccine production, such as equipment, machinery, and supplies," Biden had said.What are those critical raw materials?The long list of raw materials that SII imports from the US include filters, bags, and adjuvant. Large, sterile plastic bags are used to grow vaccine cells. An adjuvant is a substance that is used to increase the efficacy of a vaccine and helps the immune system generate antibodies.While vaccine manufacturers can establish a fresh supply chain for raw materials like filters and sterile plastic bags, the disruption in the supply of adjuvant could hamper production for a longer period. Authorised vaccines are made with a certain adjuvant and any change in the vendor of that adjuvant would lead to fresh clinical trials and approvals.“Developing new suppliers in the eleventh hour will take a bit of time. We will do that. We will not be dependent on the US after six months. The problem is we need it now,” Adar Poonawalla was quoted by India Today as saying.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-vaccine-what-raw-materials-poonawalla-wants-us-to-lift-export-ban-from-101618576174734.html

Tareen was facing corruption charges and had initially refused to accept the post until his name was cleared.It was not known if the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) dropped charges against him or not.He is a cousin of Jehangir Tareen, dubbed as sugar baron due to several sugar mills, who is an influential politician but is facing probe in the sugar scandal of the present government.Shaukat Tareen is replacing Hammad Azhar, who was appointed towards the end of the last month after Dr Abdul Hafeez Shaikh was removed for failure to control raging inflation in the country.Azhar, who was also serving a minister of industries and production, was appointed Minister for Energy after the reshuffle, while Khusro Bakhtiar was given the charge of ministry of industries and production.Minister for Science Fawad Chaudhry was appointed information minister while his predecessor Shibli Faraz was appointed as minister for science.It will be Chauhdry’s second stint as information minister as he was given the charge in 2018 but later shifted to ministry of science. Former energy minister Umar Ayub Khan was shifted to head the ministry of economic affairs.Khan has shuffled his cabinet several times since coming to power in August 2018, which his critics say was a sign of his failure to find a proper combination.“Ministers have been changed many times but it made no difference. Maybe it is time to change the prime minister,” Murtaza Wahab of Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/imran-khan-appoints-new-finance-minister-shaukat-tareen-to-assume-charge-101618571150998.html
16-04-2021||World||Indianapolis mass shooting: 8 killed at FedEx facility. What do we know so far||Eight people were killed and several others injured Thursday in the latest mass shooting incident at a FedEx facility in the US city of Indianapolis, according to police. Genae Cook, the police spokesperson, told a news conference that at least four people were hospitalised, including one victim with critical injuries."As officers arrived, they came into contact with an active shooting incident," said Cook, adding that the shooting had taken place at around 11:00pm local time (08:30am IST, Friday).According to the spokesperson, officers entered the facility without hesitation and “did their job”, stressing that they are trying to face this “because this is a sight no one should ever have to see.” Cook said that the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department (IMPD) is leading the investigation into the mass shooting and working with state police to interview witnesses from the scene. She added that the motive for the killing was unclear.Local media quoted a FedEx worker, Jeremiah Miller, as saying he had seen the gunman firing with a “submachine gun”. "I saw a man with a sub-machine gun of some sort, an automatic rifle, and he was firing in the open. I immediately ducked down and got scared and my friend’s mother, she came in and told us to get inside the car," Miller said.An Indian-origin man, Parminder Singh, told local WTTV that his niece was among those who were injured in the shooting incident. “She called as I was asleep at home. She said there was a shooting in the FedEx. So we just drove from Brownsburg,” said Singh. “She got shot on her left arm...she's fine, she's in the hospital now,” he added.After law enforcement officials were informed of a "mass casualty situation" at the FedEx ground facility near Indianapolis International Airport, the delivery services company said in a statement that they were working to gather more information and cooperating with investigating authorities.Last month, a shooting at a Colorado supermarket claimed 10 lives including that of a police officer. In Georgia, a white gunman went on a shooting rampage at three Atlanta-area massage parlours that sent terror through the Asian American community.According to the Gun Violence Archive, a non-profit group that provides near real-time reporting of gun violence incidents in the United States, gun violence deaths from all causes stands at 12,395 so far this year in the US, of which 147 were in mass shootings. US President Joe Biden recently announced six executive measures to help stem the gun violence cases but legislation for greater gun control is being resisted by Republicans.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indianapolis-mass-shooting-8-killed-at-fedex-facility-what-do-we-know-so-far-101618569983249.html

16-04-2021||World||Pakistan suspends services of social media platforms following violent protest||Pakistan on Friday temporarily suspended the services of social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook and WhatsApp to stop their use to organise demonstrations following violent protests by a radical religious group that has now been banned by the government.The government banned Tehreek-i-Labaik Pakistan (TLP) on Thursday following three days of violent protest by it to force the government to expel the French ambassador over a blasphemous caricature published in France last year.The TLP had launched the country-wide protest on Monday after the arrest of its chief Saad Hussain Rizvi.The TLP supporters clashed with the law enforcement agencies in several towns and cities earlier this week, leaving seven persons dead and over 300 policemen injured.To stop the protests after Friday prayers, the Interior Ministry directed the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) to suspend social media services for four hours from 11 am to 3 pm.The PTA said in a notification that “complete access to social media platforms (Twitter, Facebook, WhatsApp, YouTube and Telegram) may be blocked”.The reason for the suspension of the services was not stated by the PTA but official sources said that it was feared that protesters could use social media to organise demonstrations.Suspension of internet and mobile phone services is a common practice in Pakistan to forestall protests and acts of terrorism.But this time only social media has been particularly targeted as the TLP was reportedly using it effectively against the government action.On Thursday, Interior Minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmed warned the TLP against using YouTube to upload propaganda videos. The TLP came to prominence in November 2017 when it staged a sit-in at the Faizabad interchange near Islamabad and cut off the capital from the old international airport.Pakistan Muslims League-Nawaz (PML-N) was in the government then and Imran Khan, the current prime minister, and his Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf party had supported the protest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-suspends-services-of-social-media-platforms-following-violent-protest-101618567590777.html
16-04-2021||World||3 resign from Auschwitz museum board after right-wing leader's appointment||Three members of an advisory council for the Auschwitz-Birkenau Museum in Poland have resigned after the government appointed a former Polish prime minister Beata Szydlo, a top member of the country's right-wing ruling party, to serve on the council.Culture minister Piotr Glinski recently appointed Szydlo to a four-year term on the Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum Council, a nine-member body made up of Poles who meet once a year to advise the museum's director. It is separate from the International Auschwitz Council, which is made up of Holocaust survivors and international experts.The first advisory council member to resign was philosopher Stanislaw Krajewski, who said he took the step Tuesday to protest what he called the “politicisation” of a group that so far had been made up of experts. He was followed by historians Marek Lasota, who also belongs to the ruling party, and Krystyna Oleksy, a former deputy director of the Auschwitz museum.Krajewski, who was about to begin his third four-year term, told The Associated Press on Friday that he does not remember a politician ever being named to the council and he did not feel comfortable with the step, particularly given the of the populist and nationalist Law and Justice Party.“It’s hard to say what would happen, but it would change the nature of the body very considerably,” Krajewski said. “I don’t want to be on the same council with a major politician of the ruling party today.”Krajewski is a co-creator of a post-World War II history section at the POLIN Museum of the History of Polish Jews in Warsaw and a co-founder of the Polish Council of Christians and Jews. He is also a leading member of Warsaw's Jewish community who since the 1970s has worked to revive the Jewish life in Poland that was nearly wiped out by the Holocaust.After the Law and Justice party took power in 2015, its leaders launched what they described as a “historical policy offensive” aimed at building national pride in the nation's past. The party has used museums, state media and other tools to push a patriotic vision of Poland which critics say has veered into an abuse of history and distortion.Poles are extremely proud of the nation's role in resisting the German occupation during nearly six years of World War II, both at home and abroad. The government has sought to focus on that aspect of Polish behavior during the war, including the Poles who saved Jews, while seeking to discourage examinations of the role some Poles had in helping occupying German forces in their roundup and mass killing of Jews.The strategy has led to accusations of historical whitewashing and created international controversies in recent years.“The fear is that this would be another move in the direction of making also the Auschwitz-Birkenau museum part of their historical policy," Krajewski said.Szydlo, who was prime minister from 2015-2017, made commented at a memorial observance at Auschwitz in 2017 that appeared to defend her government's tough anti-refugee policies. Szydlo later denied that her comments were about migration.Szydlo is now is a member of the European Parliament for the Law and Justice party. She has studied ethnography and history, and is from the area of Oswiecim, the Polish town where the site of the former Auschwitz death camp is located.Earlier this week, she called her appointment “an honor and a great duty for me, an inhabitant of the Oswiecim region.”Emails to her office and the Culture Ministry seeking comment on the council resignations went unanswered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/3-resign-from-auschwitz-museum-board-after-right-wing-leader-s-appointment-101618567764143.html

16-04-2021||World||China’s GDP grows at record 18.3% in first quarter as recovery speeds up||China’s economy grew by a record 18.3% in the first quarter of 2021, propelled by demand at home and abroad and government fiscal support after a deep pandemic-induced slump last year.It was the biggest jump in gross domestic product (GDP) since China started keeping quarterly records in 1992.The GDP reached 24.93 trillion yuan ($3.82 trillion) in Q1, up 0.6% from the fourth quarter of last year, data from China’s National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed on Friday.The Chinese economy had registered a 6.8% contraction in Q1 2020 due to the impact of lockdowns following the outbreak of the coronavirus, which first emerged in the Chinese city of Wuhan.Aided by stringent virus containment and tracking measures and financial emergency relief for businesses, the economy has since slowly recovered – a rebound, firstly, led by overseas demand, and then by local consumption as shops, restaurants and markets across China opened up.The jump in GDP undershot the 19% forecast by economists in a Reuters poll, but it was the fastest since 1992, and up from 6.5% in the fourth quarter last year.“Thanks to the effective measures that the government has taken to control the pandemic and stimulate the economy, we have observed resilient momentum in economic indicators coming from both the production and consumption side,” Hoffman Cheong, EY China North managing partner, told the news agency Xinhua.In particular, catering sales had almost returned to the level at the beginning of 2019, suggesting strong sentiment of the populace to go out, meet people and spend money, said Cheong.“This is the underlying reason why we are confident in China’s outlook,” Cheong said.“Millions of Chinese stayed at their working cities during the spring festival holidays, coupled with the resurgence of sporadic coronavirus cases, which curbed consumption to some extent in the first two months. With the roll-out of vaccination plans across the country, there is a turnaround in March,” Lian Ping, head of Zhixin Investment Research Institute, told the tabloid Global Times.Despite the economic rebound, the NBS warned of “high uncertainties and instabilities” as Covid-19 continues to spread globally and the foundation for the domestic economic recovery is yet to solidify.“The long-standing structural problems remain prominent with new situations and issues arising from development,” the NBS said.The International Monetary Fund projected that the Chinese economy will grow by 8.4% in 2021, 0.3% points above the January forecast, according to its World Economic Outlook released in early April.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinas-gdp-grows-at-record-18-3-in-first-quarter-as-recovery-speeds-up-101618565715273.html
16-04-2021||World||How the Kremlin provides a safe harbor for ransomware||A global epidemic of digital extortion known as ransomware is crippling local governments, hospitals, school districts and businesses by scrambling their data files until they pay up. Law enforcement has been largely powerless to stop it.One big reason: Ransomware rackets are dominated by Russian-speaking cybercriminals who are shielded — and sometimes employed — by Russian intelligence agencies, according to security researchers, US law enforcement, and now the Biden administration.On Thursday, as the US slapped sanctions on Russia for malign activities including state-backed hacking, the Treasury Department said Russian intelligence has enabled ransomware attacks by cultivating and co-opting criminal hackers and giving them safe harbor. With ransomware damages now well into the tens of billions of dollars, former British intelligence cyber chief Marcus Willett recently deemed the scourge “arguably more strategically damaging than state cyber-spying.”The value of Kremlin protection isn’t lost on the cybercriminals themselves. Earlier this year, a Russian-language dark-web forum lit up with criticism of a ransomware purveyor known only as “Bugatti,” whose gang had been caught in a rare US-Europol sting. The assembled posters accused him of inviting the crackdown with technical sloppiness and by recruiting non-Russian affiliates who might be snitches or undercover cops.Worst of all, in the view of one long-active forum member, Bugatti had allowed Western authorities to seize ransomware servers that could have been sheltered in Russia instead. “Mother Russia will help,” that individual wrote. “Love your country and nothing will happen to you.” The conversation was captured by the security firm Advanced Intelligence, which shared it with the Associated Press.“Like almost any major industry in Russia, (cybercriminals) work kind of with the tacit consent and sometimes explicit consent of the security services,” said Michael van Landingham, a former CIA analyst who runs the consultancy Active Measures LLC.Russian authorities have a simple rule, said Karen Kazaryan, CEO of the software industry-supported Internet Research Institute in Moscow: “Just don’t ever work against your country and businesses in this country. If you steal something from Americans, that’s fine.”Unlike North Korea, there is no indication Russia’s government benefits directly from ransomware crime, although Russian President Vladimir Putin may consider the resulting havoc a strategic bonus.In the US alone last year, ransomware struck more than a hundred federal, state and municipal agencies, upward of 500 hospitals and other health care centers, some 1,680 schools, colleges and universities and hundreds of businesses, according to the cybersecurity firm Emsisoft.Damage in the public sector alone is measured in rerouted ambulances, postponed cancer treatments, interrupted municipal bill collection, canceled classes and rising insurance costs – all during the worst public health crisis in more than a century.The idea behind these attacks is simple: Criminals infiltrate malicious data-scrambling software into computer networks, use it to “kidnap” an organization’s data files, then demand huge payments, now as high as $50 million, to restore them. The latest twist: if victims fail to pay up, the criminals may publish their unscrambled data on the open internet.In recent months, US law enforcement has worked with partners including Ukraine and Bulgaria to bust up these networks. But with the criminal masterminds out of reach, such operations are generally little more than whac-a-mole.Collusion between criminals and the government is nothing new in Russia, said Adam Hickey, a US deputy assistant attorney general, who noted that cybercrime can provide good cover for espionage.Back in the 1990s, Russian intelligence frequently recruited hackers for that purpose, said Kazaryan. Now, he said, ransomware criminals are just as likely to be moonlighting state-employed hackers.The Kremlin sometimes enlists arrested criminal hackers by offering them a choice between prison and working for the state, said Dmitri Alperovitch, former chief technical officer of the cybersecurity firm Crowdstrike. Sometimes the hackers use the same computer systems for state-sanctioned hacking and off-the-clock cybercrime for personal enrichment, he said. They may even mix state with personal business.That’s what happened in a 2014 hack of Yahoo that compromised more than 500 million user accounts, allegedly including those of Russian journalists and US and Russian government officials. A US investigation led to the 2017 indictment of four men, including two officers of Russia’s FSB security service – a successor to the KGB. One of them, Dmitry Dokuchaev, worked in the same FSB office that cooperates with the FBI on computer crime. Another defendant, Alexsey Belan, allegedly used the hack for personal gain.A Russian Embassy spokesman declined to address questions about his government’s alleged ties to ransomware criminals and state employees’ alleged involvement in cybercrime. “We do not comment on any indictments or rumors,” said Anton Azizov, the deputy press attache in Washington.Proving links between the Russian state and ransomware gangs is not easy. The criminals hide behind pseudonyms and periodically change the names of their malware strains to confuse Western law enforcement.But at least one ransomware purveyor has been linked to the Kremlin. Maksim Yakubets, 33, is best known as co-leader of a cybergang that cockily calls itself Evil Corp. The Ukraine-born Yakubets lives a flashy lifestyle, He drives a customized Lamborghini supercar with a personalized number plate that translates to ‘Thief,’ according to Britain’s National Crime Agency.Yakubets started working for the FSB in 2017, tasked with projects including “acquiring confidential documents through cyber-enabled means and conducting cyber-enabled operations on its behalf,” according to a December 2019 US indictment. At the same time, the US Treasury Department slapped sanctions on Yakubets and offered a $5 million reward for information leading to his capture. It said he was known to have been “in the process of obtaining a license to work with Russian classified information from the FSB.”The indictment charged Evil Corp. with developing and distributing ransomware used to steal at least $100 million in more than 40 countries over the previous decade, including payrolls pilfered from towns in the American heartland.By the time Yakubets was indicted, Evil Corp. had become a major ransomware player, security researchers say. By May 2020, the gang was distributing a ransomware strain that was used to attack eight Fortune 500 companies, including the GPS device maker Garmin, whose network was offline for days after an attack, according to Advanced Intelligence.Yakubets remains at large. Another Russian currently imprisoned in France, however, might offer more insight into the dealings of cybercriminals and the Russian state. Alexander Vinnick was convicted of laundering $160 million in criminal proceeds through a cryptocurrency exchange called BTC-e. A 2017 US indictment charged that “some of the largest known purveyors of ransomware” actually used it to launder $4 billion. But Vinnick can’t be extradited until he completes his 5-year French prison sentence in 2024.Still, a 2018 study by the nonpartisan think tank Third Way found the odds of successfully prosecuting authors of cyberattacks against US targets — ransomware and online bank theft are the costliest — are no better than three in a thousand. Experts say that those odds have gotten longer.This week’s sanctions send a strong message, but aren't likely to deter Putin unless the financial sting hits closer to home, many analysts believe.That might require the kind of massive multinational coordination that followed the 9/11 terror attacks. For instance, allied countries could identify banking institutions known to launder ransomware proceeds and cut them off from the global financial community.“If you’re able to follow the money and disrupt the money and take the economic incentive out, that’ll go a long way in stopping ransomware attacks,” said John Riggi, cybersecurity advisor for the American Hospital Association and a former FBI official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/how-the-kremlin-provides-a-safe-harbor-for-ransomware-101618565060769.html

However, it is likely to raise tensions even as Iran negotiates with world powers in Vienna over a way to allow the U.S. back into the agreement and lift the crushing economic sanctions it faces.The announcement also marks a significant escalation after the sabotage that damaged centrifuges, an attack this past weekend suspected of having been carried out by Israel. While Israel has yet to claim it, the country is widely suspected of having carried out the still-unexplained sabotage at Natanz, Iran's main enrichment site.“The will of the Iranian nation is a miracle-maker and it will defuse any conspiracy,” state television quoted Qalibaf as saying. He said the enrichment began just after midnight Friday.The move could inspire a further response from Israel amid a long-running shadow war between the nations.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed never to allow Tehran to obtain a nuclear weapon and his country has twice preemptively bombed Mideast nations to stop their atomic programs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-starts-enriching-uranium-at-60-its-highest-level-ever-101618564147850.html

16-04-2021||World||UK finds 77 cases of Covid-19 variant first found in India||UK health authorities have identified 77 cases of the highly infectious B.1.617 variant of coronavirus which causes Covid-19, first found in India, and has designated it a Variant Under Investigation (VUI).Public Health England (PHE), which releases weekly updates on the number of confirmed new cases of Variants of Concern (VOC) and VUI in the UK, reported on Thursday that the variant first detected in India includes a number of mutations."A new variant has been designated a Variant Under Investigation (VUI) by PHE. The variant, first detected in India, includes a number of mutations including E484Q, L452R, and P681R,” the PHE weekly report said.“PHE has identified 77 cases of this variant in the UK and all appropriate public health interventions will be undertaken, including enhanced contact tracing. This variant has been designated VUI-21APR-01. PHE and international partners continue to monitor the situation closely,” it said.The B.1.617 strain's mutations are feared to make the variant spread faster and partially evade immunity. The variant is believed to be largely responsible for India’s current second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, with infection rates and hospitalisations on the rise once again.It also led to UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson deciding to shorten the length of his India visit later this month, with the bulk of the events now expected to be limited to a day-long packed schedule on April 26.“We have been in close contact with the Indian government about the Prime Minister’s upcoming visit in light of the Covid-19 situation in India. As a result of these discussions the Prime Minister has made the decision to reduce the length of the visit, due to take place at the end of this month, to a shorter programme in New Delhi,” the UK PM’s spokesperson at 10 Downing Street said.India at present is not on the "red list" of countries, which involves more stringent hotel-based quarantine requirements for travellers commuting between India and the UK. If further concerns emerge around the Indian B.1.617 variant in the UK, it could be categorised from a Variant Under Investigation to a Variant of Concern.The latest addition brings the total number of variants detected in the UK to 56, including the so-called Kent variant and South African strains which is top of the UK's concerns. The PHE said that the dominant variant in the country continues to be VOC-20DEC-01 B.1.1.7, or the Kent variant, which is being monitored closely.“The best way to stop the spread of the virus is to remember: hands, face, space and follow the restrictions in place,” the PHE said.Earlier this week, people living in four boroughs in south London were urged to get tested as part of a surge testing drive after cases of the South African variant were found in Wandsworth, Lambeth, Barnet and Southwark.It comes as all parts of the United Kingdom began easing lockdown restrictions gradually this week, with non-essential retail shops, hairdressers and outdoor-serving restaurants among the businesses allowed to operate once again after months of lockdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-finds-77-cases-of-covid-19-variant-first-found-in-india-101618563326457.html

He’s brilliant,” he said.Biprojit said his sibling was self-employed and most recently was working on a cryptocurrency security programme. Online profiles show that Shuvro also dabbled in artificial intelligence.He said the family started to see changes in Shuvro's demeanour over the past year, but that he largely kept his struggles to himself. Shuvro's family urged him to talk to someone.“We tried to convince him to the best of our abilities to seek professional help, but he always denied that he needed psychiatric help,” said Biprojit.“He was going to a neurologist but he wouldn’t say for what," he said.According to the report, in February, the management of Shuvro's West 37th Street apartment building took him to Manhattan Supreme Court, seeking to evict him over a slew of alleged bizarre acts inside the building, including setting fires, openly brandishing a knife and smearing blood inside the elevator, court filings show.“Defendant is a ticking time bomb who, just months into the lease, has engaged in numerous incidents of escalating, offensive nuisance-type conduct that threatens the lives, health, safety and well-being of Building staff, Building residents and Building property,” lawyers for the building wrote in one filing.The filing claimed that Biswas had intentionally set a mattress on fire in his unit — while leaving an open propane tank in the apartment.He also allegedly brandished a knife, smeared blood in the building elevator, illegally installed surveillance cameras and an alarm system, scattered bullets throughout the building and filed multiple false reports of intruders with the police — one of which saw him greet responding officers by “brandishing a sword,” according to the filing.Shuvro had explained the arson allegation as a cooking fire.The city Medical Examiner’s Office will determine a cause of death.

the RCSS, for example, is currently locked in conflict with two other Shan state organisations.The various rebel groups also lack the fire and manpower of Myanmar's military, a modern army equipped with fighter jets and armoured vehicles.'Our common enemy'A humanitarian crisis is already brewing in neighbouring Karen state, where the military has carried out air strikes on towns held by the Karen National Union (KNU).About 24,000 people were displaced by the bombings, said the KNU, with thousands crossing the border briefly into Thailand.The KNU is sheltering around 2,000 dissidents who have fled urban hotspots.One activist who stayed in their territory said the distrust of CRPH -- and the ethnic Bamar majority in general -- is high, even if the rebels are outraged over the coup."They must apologise to the ethnic minorities for what the previous government has done," said the activist, declining to be named."That's the very first step by which they can gain trust."KNU's head of foreign affairs Padoh Saw Taw Nee said the group is "cautiously optimistic" about the CRPH's promise for federalism."We just have to work together with them," he told AFP."There are lots of obstacles but we are trying to find a way to overthrow our common enemy."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/rebel-groups-see-opportunity-in-post-coup-myanmar-101618559965481.html
16-04-2021||World||Brazilian health workers forced to intubate Covid patients without sedatives: Reports||Reports are emerging of Brazilian health workers forced to intubate patients without the aid of sedatives, after weeks of warnings that hospitals and state governments risked running out of critical medicines.One doctor at the Albert Schweitzer municipal hospital in Rio de Janeiro told the Associated Press that for days health workers diluted sedatives to make their stock last longer. Once it ran out, nurses and doctors had to begin using neuromuscular blockers and tying patients to their beds, the doctor said.“You relax the muscles and do the procedure easily, but we don’t have sedation,” said the doctor, who agreed to discuss the sensitive situation only if not quoted by name. “Some try to talk, resist. They’re conscious.”Lack of required medicines is the latest pandemic problem to befall Brazil, which is experiencing a brutal COVID-19 outbreak that has flooded the nation’s intensive care units. The daily death count is averaging about 3,000, accounting for a quarter of deaths globally and making Brazil the epicenter of the pandemic.“Intubation kits” include anesthetics, sedatives and other medications used to put severely ill patients on ventilators. The press office of Rio city's health secretariat said in an email that occasional shortages at the Albert Schweitzer facility are due to difficulties obtaining supplies on the global market and that “substitutions are made so that there is no damage to the assistance provided.” It didn't comment on the need to tie patients to beds.The newspaper O Globo on Thursday reported similar ordeals in several other hospitals in the Rio metropolitan region, with people desperately calling other facilities seeking sedatives for their loved ones.It’s unclear whether the problem seen in Rio remains an isolated case, but others are sounding the alarm about impending shortages.Sao Paulo state's health secretary, Jean Carlo Gorinchteyn, said at a news conference Wednesday that the situation was dire in the hospitals of Brazil's most-populous state. On Thursday, more than 640 hospitals were on the verge of collapse, with shortages possible within days, officials said.“We need the federal government's support,” Gorinchteyn said. “This is not a necessity for Sao Paulo; it is a necessity for the whole country.”His state's health officials sent nine requests for intubation medication to the Health Ministry over the past 40 days, according to a statement Wednesday. Its last delivery was enough to cover just 6% of monthly needs in the state’s public health network, officials told AP.Federal Health Minister Marcelo Queiroga, who took over the post last month, said Wednesday that a shipment of sedatives was expected to arrive in Brazil “in the next ten days.” It is the result of a contract signed with the Pan American Health Organization.He said two separate efforts to acquire medications on the international market are underway “to end this day-to-day struggle.”For many weeks, the ministry has also been facing logistical constraints on getting oxygen delivered to hospitals across the country. Queiroga said it remains "a daily concern.″A more contagious coronavirus variant, known as P.1, has been spreading across Brazil this year. It may also be more aggressive than the original strain, and health workers have reported patients requiring far more oxygen than last year.The private sector has stepped up to help address some of the supply shortfall. A group of seven large companies donated 3.4 million doses of intubation drugs — enough for the management of 500 beds for six weeks — to the Health Ministry.A first batch of 2.3 million was scheduled to arrive from China late Thursday at Sao Paulo's international airport and would be distributed to states with critical shortages, the ministry said in an emailed response to AP questions about supply bottlenecks.Last month, the Health Ministry requisitioned intubation medications from laboratories, reportedly as a means to distribute to the neediest hospitals. That has caused others facilities’ stocks to dwindle, said Edson Rogatti, director of an association of more than 2,000 hospitals nationwide.“If we run out, the health sector will be in chaos,” Rogatti said on Globo News TV.Shortages aren’t limited to the public sector. Brazil’s private hospital association published a survey Thursday in which nine of 71 institutions reported having supplies for five days or less. About half said they had enough for a week.Private facilities are looking to import medications from India, but still need regulatory approval, the association told AP.The city of Itaiopolis in southern Santa Catarina state this week reported shortages of both sedatives and oxygen. Neighboring Rio Grande do Sul state also reported supplies running out.“The situation is desperate,” Rio Grande do Sul’s health secretary, Arita Bergmann, said in a statement Thursday. “We urgently need the Health Ministry to replenish hospitals’ stocks, or else intubated patients can wake up without medication, and that would be terrible.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brazilian-health-workers-forced-to-intubate-covid-patients-without-sedatives-reports-101618559004617.html

A strong performance from the bank executives may discourage progressive Democrats from scheduling more hearings or from introducing adverse legislation," he added.While the industry's image in Washington has improved since the financial crisis a decade ago, Democratic lawmakers have expressed skepticism that lenders are doing all they can to help Americans and small businesses hurt by the pandemic.They are likely to grill the CEOs on the industry's role in the small-business Paycheck Protection Program and ask them to address concerns, flagged by several congressional reports, that lenders dished out the cash to fraudsters and discriminated against some borrowers.Industry officials also expect lawmakers to focus on how mortgage lenders are helping homeowners, and whether they are doing enough to prevent a foreclosure crisis. Other Democratic goals, including tackling racial injustice and climate change, are also expected to feature in the discussion.After the banks posted bumper profits in this year's first quarter and as President Joe Biden floats the idea of raising taxes on the wealthy, the millionaire chief executives are also likely to be grilled on whether Wall Street and its rich executives pay enough to the government.Representatives for the banks declined to comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bank-ceos-to-testify-as-us-congress-ramps-up-scrutiny-of-wall-street-101618556967903.html

Its iron dome was built in Vienna and carried in sections down the Danube on barges.For its consecration in 1856, Hungarian composer and pianist Franz Liszt composed a mass. But the cathedral was still not finished, with the main portico and interior only completed later in the 19th century.A new time capsule might be placed in the cross for future generations. But its copper cover will be sealed on June 30, so they will have to move quickly, Torok said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/176yearold-time-capsule-found-inside-cross-on-hungary-s-largest-church-101618548639283.html
16-04-2021||World||US introduces law on climate action, seeks renewed cooperation with India||A group of 10 US Senators have introduced a comprehensive international climate change legislation that among other things seeks to reinvigorate bilateral cooperation with India in this sector, ahead of next week's Leaders' Summit on Climate being convened by the White House.Prime Minister Narendra Modi is among the 40 world leaders invited by US President Joe Biden to the Leaders’ Summit on Climate on April 22 and 23.Being built as a key milestone on the road to the UN Climate Change Conference (COP26) this November in Glasgow, the Leaders' Summit on Climate will underscore the urgency and the economic benefits of stronger climate action.Senator Bob Menendez, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, who introduced the United States Climate Leadership in International Mitigation, Adaptation, and Technology Enhancement Act of 2021 (U.S. CLIMATE Act), along with nine of his other Democratic colleagues, said that the legislation represents the most comprehensive foreign policy focused climate change bill introduced in Congress.Laying out a bold vision to assure the United States appropriately leads the global effort to combat the climate crisis through a new suite of climate foreign policy, climate finance and foreign assistance, and climate diplomacy programmes and initiatives, the legislation also directs US bilateral and multilateral engagements and strategies on climate and improves integration of climate policy into all aspects of American foreign affairs.Devoting a separate section on India, the legislation that runs into 212 pages urges the Biden administration to take steps to reinvigorate bilateral cooperation with India on research development and investment in clean energy technology.Since demand for energy in India will increase with the expansion of the economy and middle-class of India, it is in the interest of the United States national security and global security for the US to support India in growing the energy sector of India environmentally and socially responsible ways that mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and improve the climate security of India, the legislation says.India, the act says, has met its growing energy demands by becoming a global leader in renewable energy generation.Despite significant investments in renewable energy and the implementation of strong national greenhouse gas mitigation policies, India continues to operate some of the world's dirtiest fossil fuel power plants and has high emissions generated from its transportation sector, it said.Asserting that India is a critical market for foreign investment and will be a major competitor in international clean energy development futures, the legislation says that India's leadership within the Clean Energy Ministerial, the Mission Innovation initiative, and the International Solar Alliance has put it at the forefront of renewable energy development.It has also helped India achieve a top-five global rank among clean energy producers.Installed electricity capacity from renewables in India grew by 144 per cent between 2014 and 2020.Approximately USD 42 billion was invested into India's renewable energy sector between 2014 and 2019, it said.The CLIMATE Act says that the US should support efforts to strengthen India's resilience capacities that ensure people, households, communities, institutions, and systems can assess, anticipate, prevent, adapt to, cope with, and recover from shocks and stresses as associated with the effects of climate change.The United States, through the Bureau of Energy Resources of the Department of State, the United States Agency for International Development, the United States International Development Finance Corporation, the Department of Energy, the Export-Import Bank of the US, and the International Trade Administration, should encourage private sector investment in, and financing for the development and deployment of clean energy and climate mitigation technologies in India, it said.Among others it seeks robust cooperation between the two countries to develop and deploy clean energy technologies, including private sector cooperation, should be a top bilateral energy diplomacy priority and the top priority in the countries' energy diplomacy and should include clean energy; electric vehicles and expansive charging station networks; next-generation refrigeration equipment and refrigerants; and other technologies and chemicals that are in the interest of US industry leaders in the refrigeration and chemical coolant industries that are compliant with the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol.In a statement, Menendez said this comprehensive legislation has been introduced to bolster Biden's commitment to restore America's role as a responsible actor in confronting the climate change crisis."The US CLIMATE Act represents an important step forward in ensuring Congress does its part in providing resources, programs and policy to expedite the restoration of our nation's climate diplomacy and leadership," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-introduces-law-on-climate-action-seeks-renewed-cooperation-with-india-101618545879839.html
16-04-2021||World||SpaceX gets Nasa nod to launch third manned mission of the year||SpaceX is gearing up for its third astronaut launch in under a year, after getting the green light from Nasa a week ahead of next Thursday’s planned flight.Managers from Nasa and Elon Musk’s space company Thursday cleared the Falcon rocket and Dragon capsule for a dawn liftoff with a crew of four to the International Space Station. They will spend six months at the orbiting lab, replacing another SpaceX crew that’s close to coming home.This will be the first crew flight using a recycled Falcon and Dragon. Both were designed for reuse.The rocket was used to launch the current station crew last November from Nasa's Kennedy Space Center. The capsule, dubbed Endeavour, also will be making a repeat performance; it carried two test pilots to the space station on SpaceX’s first crew flight last spring.SpaceX refurbished both and added safety upgrades. Most of the capsule is already “flight-proven,” company officials noted, except for some new valves, thermal protection covers and parachutes.Kathy Lueders, head of Nasa's human exploration office, said it was “moving” to be on the verge of flying three SpaceX crew flights in 11 months.“Looking back, it’s really, really amazing what both the SpaceX and Nasa teams have accomplished,” she said.SpaceX said it must resolve one issue before conducting a test firing at the launch pad this weekend. It appears the company has been loading more liquid oxygen into its first-stage boosters than anticipated, and engineers want to make “extra certain” that poses no safety risks, said Bill Gerstenmaier, a new SpaceX vice president who used to work for Nasa.Three of the astronauts are back for their second space station mission: NASA’s Shane Kimbrough, France’s Thomas Pesquet and Japan’s Akihiko Hoshide. NASA astronaut Megan McArthur was part of the final Hubble Space Telescope repair team in 2009.For nearly a decade, the only route to the space station for astronauts was on Russian rockets. Nasa turned to private companies for taxi service after the space shuttles retired in 2011. SpaceX has been shipping cargo to the space station since 2012, using the same kind of rocket and similar capsules, and recycling those parts as well.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/spacex-gets-nasa-nod-to-launch-third-manned-mission-of-the-year-101618537668688.html
16-04-2021||World||Cuba's Raul Castro to step down, ending 60 years of family monopoly||Cuba's leadership is passing to a younger generation, with the last Castro leaving office and ending a 60-year family monopoly, but there is little other change as power remains firmly with the Communist Party.At a four-day party congress starting Friday, 89-year-old Raul Castro will relinquish the country's most powerful position -- that of party first secretary -- to 60-year-old Miguel Diaz-Canel, Cuba's president.This officially ends six decades of dominion over Cuban politics by Castro and his brother Fidel, who ruled for nearly half a century from 1959 to 2006 and is widely revered as the country's father and saviour.Diaz-Canel will be only the third-ever first secretary of the all-powerful Communist Party of Cuba (PCC), while still retaining the presidency.He also becomes Cuba's first civilian leader since the Castro-led revolution of the 1950s, which happened before he was even born.But while the suit-and-tie wearing, tech-savvy Beatles fan may be more modern in some ways than his predecessors -- both of whom were fond of donning military garb -- he remains first and foremost a party disciple.Socialism 'irrevocable'"He is part of the political struggle, the ideological struggle," said Carlos Alzugaray, a former Cuban diplomat."The absence of a Castro at the helm doesn't necessarily mean there's going to be an abrupt change in the Communist party's style," added Norman McKay, an analyst with The Economist Intelligence Unit.A new constitution passed in May 2019 made it clear that the country's commitment to socialism was "irrevocable."Yet many Cubans pay little heed to politics, preoccupied as they are by the worst economic crisis in 30 years, sky-high inflation, biting food shortages, snaking queues for basic necessities and limited freedoms."I hope the congress will lead to an improvement because the prices are too high," said pensioner Maria Martinez, 68."There is nothing to hope for," added Sergio, a 44-year-old cook who declined to give his full name in a country where speaking out against the government can land you in trouble."Salaries are a problem, they are not enough. There are problems with food, the lines are long," he said.Economic collapseCuba's economic crisis is caused in part by its own management failures, worsened by US sanctions ramped up under Donald Trump and the coronavirus pandemic, which dried up tourists -- a key income source for the island.The economy plummeted by 11% in 2020, the worst decline since 1993 in the country of 11.2 million.Economic reforms to phase out the US dollar-pinned "convertible" peso -- leaving only the less valuable official peso in place -- saw salaries increased by the state, but not enough to make up for the resulting price inflation.Many stores now accept only US dollars -- these are better stocked than others -- but few people can afford to frequent them.The PCC has said its congress would "review core issues of the political, economic and social life of the country."Real change 'underway'There are signs that Cuba's leadership will have little choice but to increasingly balance the interests of the old guard with a clamour for more rights and better quality of life from younger generations.In February, it opened the bulk of its government-monopolized economy to entrepreneurs in the private sector.There have also been small nods to social liberalization by Havana, under sanctions from the United States since 1962.In recent months, the government held its first-ever talks -- though short-lived -- with pro-free speech protesters, after authorizing in 2019 Cuba's first non-political demonstration, by animal rights activists."Raul Castro stepping down as head of the Communist Party in #Cuba isn't real change," tweeted US Senator Marco Rubio, who is of Cuban origin. "But real change is already underway nonetheless."'Subversion'The arrival of the internet on mobile phones at the end of 2018 has made for a paradigm shift in Cuba, with never-before-seen access to information and new forums for expression. People are even organizing demonstrations in a country where protests are rare.In response, the PCC has said its congress would be "confronting political and ideological subversion, which has made internet and social media its principal field of operations."Control over information has always been a key tool of the PCC rule.Castro has said he plans to read and take care of his grandchildren after retiring.But there are those who think he may hover in the background."Raul will be there," said former diplomat Alzugaray, in a system that may resemble "the one in China when Deng Xiaoping had no position but... everything had to be discussed with him. He had the last word."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/cubas-raul-castro-to-step-down-ending-60-years-of-family-monopoly-101618537100585.html
16-04-2021||World||Capitol Police leadership held back some equipment during riot: Official||Police officers defending the US Capitol against an attack by Donald Trump's supporters might have quelled the violence sooner had their leadership not blocked them from using weapons like sting-ball grenades, a watchdog testified on Thursday.Michael Bolton, the US Capitol Police inspector general, told the House of Representatives Administration Committee that such equipment, which release dozens of small, stinging balls, "would have provided a better posture to repel the attacks."But he testified that a Capitol Police assistant deputy chief decided that such non-lethal grenades and launchers, could have been deployed in an unsafe manner, causing serious injuries. Protesters during last summer's anti-racism demonstrations were injured by such weapons.Bolton said better training would have been the remedy to that concern.Committee Chairwoman Zoe Lofgren said investigators found that riot shields were locked in a bus too far away from police officers to quickly gain access to them during the Jan. 6 attack, forcing officers to face a violent, unruly mob with inadequate protective equipment.Former President Donald Trump and some of his fellow Republicans have tried to downplay the attack, when hundreds of his supporters stormed the Capitol in an attempt to disrupt Congress' certification of Joe Biden's presidential election victory.Five people, including Capitol Police officer Brian Sicknick, died in the violence, and many more officers suffered injuries. Lawmakers were forced to huddle in secure rooms while law enforcement battled the rioters.Bolton also testified that police standard operating procedures were not followed and that officer training deficiencies contributed to rioters being able to breach security and storm their way through the iconic Capitol.Republican Representative Bryan Steil asked Bolton whether past years' inspector general recommendations for improvements in intelligence operations and other areas were implemented.Bolton replied that in some cases they were, but subsequently they sometimes "slid off."He added that a recommendation that USCP officers receive security clearances so that they could receive detailed intelligence information -- allowing them to react to threats in a more nimble way -- were not implemented.Bolton's reports to Congress found the Capitol Police Civil Disturbance Unit was operating on Jan. 6 "at a decreased level of readiness" and that the department needed to improve its management of weapons, ammunition and riot shields.Internal investigations led to detailed recommendations that the Capitol Police immediately improve its intelligence operations and beef up the readiness of the civil disturbances unit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/capitol-police-leadership-held-back-some-equipment-during-riot-official-101618533807752.html
16-04-2021||World||Russian IT company, sanctioned by US, partners with Microsoft, IBM||The Treasury Department on Thursday slapped six Russian technology companies with sanctions for supporting Kremlin intelligence agencies engaged in “dangerous and disruptive cyber attacks.”But only one of them stands out for its international footprint and partnerships with such IT heavyweights as Microsoft and IBM.That company, Positive Technologies, claims more than 2,000 customers in 30 countries, including major European banks Societe Generale and ING, as well as Samsung, SK Telecom of South Korea and BT, the British telecommunications giant.Its clients also include the FSB, a successor to the KGB that “cultivates and co-opts criminal hackers” who carry out ransomware and phishing attacks, the Treasury Department said. The U.S. said big conventions hosted by Positive Technologies are “used as recruiting events” by the FSB and the GRU, Russia's military intelligence agency.GRU agents are the swashbucklers of Russian intelligence. The agency stands accused of spearheading the hack-and-leak operation that interfered in the 2016 U.S. presidential election to favor Donald Trump. Its agents also conducted the most damaging cyberattack on record, the runaway 2017 NotPetya virus that did more than $10 billion in global damage, its victims including the shipping giant Maersk and pharmaceutical company Merck.The CEO of the software industry-supported Internet Research Institute in Moscow, Karen Kazaryan, said he was not familiar with most of the Russian IT companies sanctioned on Thursday. But Positive Tech is well-known in the industry for its annual Hack Days conference, which is scheduled for May 20-21 at a Moscow hotel.Former CIA analyst Michael van Landingham applauded the naming and sanctioning of Russian IT companies known to have aided and abetted malign government activity.“Naming specific companies can create incentives for educated and skilled Russians who might be able to obtain jobs elsewhere where they don’t support Russian state hacking,” he said.Positive Tech's specialty is identifying vulnerabilities in popular software such as Microsoft's Windows operating system. The world’s intelligence agencies regularly lean on companies like it not to disclose potent vulnerabilities publicly when they find them but to instead quietly share them for hacking adversaries’ networks.The U.S. did not accuse Positive Technologies of any such behavior and the Treasury Department declined to answer questions about the company's activities beyond a press release.Nor would a Microsoft spokesperson discuss the company's business relationship with Positive Tech. On its website, Microsoft names the company as one of among more than 80 security software providers to which it gives early access to vulnerability information so they can make sure their customers get patches quickly. IBM also lists Positive Technologies as a security partner, offering customers one of its scanning tools.IBM didn't respond to requests for comment Thursday. Neither did other U.S. tech companies HP and VMware, which Positive Technologies lists as technology partners.On its website, Positive Technologies lists Russia’s Defense Ministry as among its first major clients, in 2004 when it was two years old with just 11 employees. It claimed more than 800 employees in 2018.Russia's biggest business database lists the company's CEO and founder as Yury Maximov, about whom little is known other than he graduated from Moscow State University. The company did not respond to questions sent to press contacts on its website.Positive Tech's website boasts of a number of accomplishments, such as providing cybersecurity for the 2018 soccer World Cup hosted by Russia and publishing data that same year on 30 high-risk vulnerabilities. It said it opened its first international office in London in 2010 and its first U.S. office in 2012.The company has sometimes used Framingham, Massachusetts, as its U.S. location in news releases, though it's not recorded in city or state records as a business by that name. An office building with an address linked to the company is a co-working space that can be rented on flexible terms for “one person or more."Market research firm IDC listed Positive Technologies as one of the fastest-growing companies in security and vulnerability management in 2012, in part because it was so small at the time, growing nearly 82% year-over-year to $30 million in worldwide revenue. Nearly all that revenue came from assessing vulnerabilities. But by 2015, its worldwide revenues fell 37.6% to $26.5 million, according to IDC, which eventually stopped tracking the company.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russian-it-company-sanctioned-by-us-partners-with-microsoft-ibm-101618533507556.html
16-04-2021||World||Daunte Wright's family wants stiffer charge for Minnesota ex-cop||Daunte Wright's family members joined with community leaders Thursday in calling for more serious charges against the white former police officer who fatally shot him, comparing her case to the murder charge brought against a Black officer who killed a white woman in nearby Minneapolis.Former Brooklyn Center police Officer Kim Potter was charged with second-degree manslaughter in Sunday's shooting of Wright, a 20-year-old Black man, during a traffic stop. The former police chief in Brooklyn Center, a majority nonwhite suburb, said Potter mistakenly fired her handgun when she meant to use her Taser. Both the chief and Potter resigned Tuesday.Also Read: Minneapolis under curfew after officer shoots Black motorist deadPotter — who was released on $100,000 bond hours after her arrest Wednesday — appeared alongside her attorney, Earl Gray, at her initial appearance Thursday over Zoom, saying little. Gray kept his camera on himself for most of the hearing, swiveling it to show Potter only briefly. Her next court appearance was set for May 17.Wright's death has been followed by protests every night this week outside the city's police station, with some demonstrators hurling objects at officers who have responded at times with gas and rubber bullets before clearing the scene with a riot line. Another protest was scheduled Thursday night, just hours after police in Chicago released graphic body camera video of an officer fatally shooting a 13-year-old boy in March.Wright's family members and protesters who have confronted police all week since his death say there’s no excuse for the shooting.“Unfortunately, there’s never going to be justice for us,” Wright’s mother, Katie Wright, said at a news conference Thursday. “Justice isn’t even a word to me. I do want accountability.”Wright family attorney Ben Crump said “full accountability, to get equal justice” is all the family wants — “nothing more, nothing less."Crump and other advocates for Wright point to the 2017 case of Mohamed Noor. The Black former Minneapolis police officer fatally shot Justine Ruszczyk Damond, a white woman who was a dual citizen of the U.S. and Australia, in the alley behind her home after she called 911 to report what she thought was a woman being assaulted.Noor was convicted of third-degree murder in addition to second-degree manslaughter and sentenced to 12 1/2 years in prison. Potter’s charge carries a maximum 10-year prison sentence. Intent isn't a necessary component of either charge. A key difference is that third-degree murder requires someone to act with a “depraved mind,” a term that has been the subject of legal disputes, but includes an act eminently dangerous to others, performed without regard for human life.Noor testified that he fired to protect his partner's life after hearing a loud bang on the squad car and seeing a woman at his partner’s window raising her arm. Prosecutors criticized Noor for shooting without seeing a weapon or Damond’s hands.Many critics of the police believe the race of those involved in the Wright shooting played a role in which charges were brought.“If the officer was Black, perhaps even a minority man, and the victim was a young, white female affluent kid, the chief would have fired him immediately and the county prosecutor would have charged him with murder, without a doubt,” said Jaylani Hussein, executive director of the Minnesota chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations.Potter could have easily been charged with third-degree murder, which carries a 25-year maximum sentence, said Rachel Moran, a law professor at the University of St. Thomas in St. Paul, Minnesota. But she noted that one difference between the Noor and Potter cases is that Potter will likely argue using the gun was a mistake, while Noor never said he didn’t intend to use his weapon.“This is kind of the compromise charge, which isn’t to say it’s not serious. It is,” Moran said. “But they’re not reaching for the most serious charge they could theoretically file. They’re also not washing their hands and saying she has no criminal liability.”The prosecutor who brought the case, Washington County Attorney Pete Orput, did not return messages seeking comment.Wright’s death came as the broader Minneapolis area awaits the outcome of the trial for Derek Chauvin, one of four officers charged in George Floyd’s death last May. Crump pointed to that trial as having the potential to set a precedent for “police officers being held accountable and sent to prison for killing Black people.”Police say Wright was pulled over for expired tags, but they sought to arrest him after discovering he had an outstanding warrant. The warrant was for his failure to appear in court on charges that he fled from officers and possessed a gun without a permit during an encounter with Minneapolis police in June.Potter, a 26-year veteran, was training another officer at the time.Body camera video shows Wright struggling with police after they say they’re going to arrest him, before Potter pulls her gun. Potter is heard yelling “Taser!” three times before she fires and then says, “Holy (expletive), I shot him.”Naisha Wright, Daunte Wright’s aunt, grew emotional at the news conference with other family members, saying, “Can we get a conviction? Can we get something? Manslaughter?”She held up a photo of a Taser. “This is a Taser, but no,” she said, displaying a photo of a handgun. “My nephew was killed with this -- a Glock.”The criminal complaint noted that Potter holstered her handgun on the right side and her Taser on the left. To remove the Taser — which is yellow and has a black grip — Potter would have to use her left hand, the complaint said.Experts say cases of officers mistakenly firing their gun instead of a Taser are rare, usually less than once a year nationwide.Wright's funeral will be April 22 at the New Salem Missionary Baptist Church in Minneapolis, his attorney said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/daunte-wright-s-family-wants-stiffer-charge-for-minnesota-excop-101618532833824.html

"We are studying the durability of the antibody response."It seems strong but there is some waning of that and no doubt the variants challenge," he said."I think for planning purposes, planning purposes only, I think we should expect that we may have to boost."The Pfizer vaccine, developed in partnership with German firm BioNTech, currently plays a leading role in American and European vaccination campaigns.The pharmaceutical giant announced in February that it was testing a third dose of its vaccine to better combat the emerging variants.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-vaccine-3rd-dose-likely-needed-within-12-months-says-pfizer-ceo-101618531882165.html
16-04-2021||World||Fears grow over mutating Brazil Covid-19 variant||Brazil’s P1 coronavirus variant, behind a deadly Covid-19 surge in the Latin American country that has raised international alarm, is mutating in ways that could make it better able to evade antibodies, according to scientists studying the virus.Research conducted by the public health institute Fiocruz into the variants circulating in Brazil found mutations in the spike region of the virus that is used to enter and infect cells.Those changes, the scientists said, could make the virus more resistant to vaccines with grave implications for the severity of the outbreak in the country.“We believe it’s another escape mechanism the virus is creating to evade the response of antibodies,” said Felipe Naveca, one of the authors of the study and part of Fiocruz in Manaus, where the P1 variant is believed to have originated. Naveca said the changes appeared to be similar to the mutations seen in the even more aggressive South African variant. “This is particularly worrying because the virus is continuing to accelerate in its evolution,” he added.In a bizarre development, federal prosecutors in the Brazilian state of Roraima are investigating reports that illegally-mined gold is being exchanged for Covid-19 vaccines in the Yanomami indigenous reserve.The number of people killed by Covid-19 climbed past 100,000 in France on Thursday, with the virus claiming a further 300 lives in the past 24 hours, the country’s health authority said. A day earlier, the death toll had stood at 99,805.The country of 67 million is the eighth in the world to reach the symbolic mark, and the third in Europe after the UK and Italy.Germany’s health care system is getting stretched to the brink, with many hospitals overwhelmed with Covid-19 patients and rising case numbers pointing to tougher days ahead. The occupancy rate in ICUs rose to 88% on Wednesday. On Thursday, Germany reported 31,117 new cases.More than 170 former world leaders and Nobel laureates have urged US President Joe Biden to make Covid-19 vaccines more readily available by waiving US intellectual property rules.

16-04-2021||World||US targets Russia for cyberattacks, election interference||The US on Thursday announced tough new sanctions targeting the Russian economy, its officials and entities for “the full scope of… harmful foreign activities” including election interference, cyber-spying, misinformation campaigns and a range of “destabilising international actions” such as in Afghanistan and Crimea.America also ordered the expulsion of 10 diplomats from the Russian mission in Washington, DC, calling them “representatives of Russian intelligence services”.Russia responded sharply to the sanctions. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov called them illegal and warned of retaliatory measures. “We condemn any sanction aspirations. We believe they are illegal. In any case, the principle of reciprocity applies in this case. Reciprocity will meet our interests in the best possible way,” he said.US President Joe Biden issued these sanctions and punitive measures through a new executive order “that provides strengthened authorities to demonstrate the administration’s resolve in responding to and deterring the full scope of Russia’s harmful foreign activities”, according to a note issued by the White House.These measures are intended, the note added, to send “a signal that the US will impose costs in a strategic and economically impactful manner on Russia if it continues or escalates its destabilising international actions”.Under the authority of the executive order, US treasury has prohibited American financial institutions from trading in Ruble or non-Ruble bonds issued by the Central Bank of the Russian Federation and other Russian institutions after 2014.It designated six tech companies charging them with providing support to Russian Intelligence Services’ cyber programme. Among these cyber actions was the SolarWinds hacking of 16,000 computer systems around the world that, the US has said, were carried out by the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service, also known as APT 29, Cozy Bear, and The Dukes.US treasury also designated 32 entities and individuals, including a top official in the president’s office first deputy chief of staff Alexei Gromov, for “government-directed attempts to influence” the 2020 presidential election.Biden had informed Russian President Vladimir Putin of these upcoming measures in a phone call on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-targets-russia-for-cyber-attacks-election-interference-101618502410418.html
16-04-2021||World||China should lift birth restrictions to take on India, US economically: Report||China should lift all birth restrictions to tackle the problems of an ageing population and plan ahead to compete economically with a demographically young India and an immigration-friendly US, a new report by the central bank has said.A working paper released by the People’s Bank of China (PBOC), China’s central bank, made public on Wednesday said the country’s ageing population problems were worse than that of other nations.Primarily focused on how China should tackle the problem of its ageing population, the paper - written by four PBOC researchers - compared the country’s situation to India and the US, making the radical suggestion that the government allow three or more children per household.China’s birth rate has been falling for years and that was why the government eased the strict one-child policy, which was in place since the late 1970s, in 2016, allowing couples to have two children.The easing of the policy hasn’t worked, though.The birth rate on the Chinese mainland dropped to 10.48 per 1,000 people in 2019, the lowest in seven decades, according to the National Bureau of Statistics; the statistics of 2020’s birth rate has not been released.“In order to achieve the long-term goals in 2035, China should fully liberalise and encourage childbirth, and sweep off difficulties women faced during pregnancy, childbirth, and kindergarten and school enrollment by all means,” the report “Understanding and Countermeasures of Demographic Countermeasures in China” said in its abstract.“Since 1949, the population of China has expanded rapidly to slower growth, the population structure has changed from pyramid to rectangle, and China’s population transition is faster, and ageing problem and sub-replacement fertility is severer,” the report said.IT’S ADVANTAGE INDIAIn a detailed section on India, the report said the gap between the two countries is narrowing.As two big countries in Asia, China’s economic growth has been faster than India’s for a long time but in recent years, with India’s late-comer advantages, China’s demographic dividend fading, India’s economic growth has tended to approach China’s, the report said.More importantly, it added that China’s ageing population and the declining birth rate will become more serious in 10 years while India’s demographic structure will be further optimised.The report pointed out that India’s labour force will exceed China’s by hundreds of millions in the years ahead. “In 2019, China’s labour force was 990 million while India had 880 million, which is 110 million less than that of China. In 2035 and 2050, India will have 1.06 billion and 1.11 billion labour force respectively, which is 120 million and 270 million more than those of China.”It added that India’s pension burden will be lighter than China’s in the future.“In 2019, the dependency ratio of India was 8.3 percentage points than that of China, while in 2035 and 2050, the gap will be widened to 18 and 23.3 percentage points; In 2019, the proportion of the elderly in India was only 6.4%, 6.2 percentage points lower than that in China. In 2035 and 2050, this advantage will expand to 11.1 percentage points and 12.3 percentage points.”By 2050, India’s demographic advantage will continue to expand, the report said, adding that in 2019, the demographics of India were much narrower at the top and wider in the middle than in China.“By 2050, this advantage will continue to grow. Not only will India have a much narrower elderly population at the top and a much wider workforce in the middle, but it will also have a wider workforce at the bottom, indicating a more abundant workforce and greater growth potential beyond 2050,” the report added.The report went on to argue that since India’s demographic advantage is expected to grow for at least the next three decades, “…India’s demographic dividend will blossom more significantly and the gap between China and India will be narrower provided that appropriate political and economic measures are taken.”U.S. BENEFITS FROM IMMIGRATIONAbout the US, the authors raised the question that if China had narrowed the gap with the country over the past 40 years by relying on cheap labour and the bonus of a huge population, what can it rely on in the next 30 years?They noted how the US benefits from immigration even as China’s population ages.The report pointed out what needs to be done for China to try and reverse the trend.“China must recognise that the demographic situation has changed…recognise that population inertia is a huge force across generations, and its reactionary force will lead to changes in the population in the opposite direction; realise that education and technological progress cannot compensate for the decline in population,” the report said.China should fully liberalise the practice of having three or more children without hesitation or limitation of the effect of the existing policy, the report added.The authors suggested that China “…should vigorously encourage childbearing. To advocate procreation is not only the business of parents and families but also the responsibility of the state and society”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-should-lift-birth-restrictions-to-take-on-india-us-economically-report-101618499230061.html
16-04-2021||India||Use hospitals of PSUs, hire retired doctors under NHM to deal with surge: Centre tells states||Reviewing the surge of coronavirus infections in Uttar Pradesh and Chhattisgarh on Friday, the Centre advised states to increase dedicated Covid-19 beds and use the hospitals of Union ministries and Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs) for treating the patients, according to a statement issued by the Central government. The states have also been advised to deploy volunteers of NSS (National Service Scheme), Nehru Yuva Kendra (NYK), women self-help groups as well as hire retired doctors/paramedics on contracts under National Health Mission (NHM) funds. In the review meeting, chaired by Union home secretary Ajay Kumar Bhalla and Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan, the Director General of ICMR – Balram Bhargava recommended setting up of more testing labs, including mobile labs. He also advised about keeping a vigil and ramping up of testing on a continuous basis in districts showing more than 5% positivity rate. At the end of the meeting, a five-fold strategy for tackling the recent surge was re-emphasised, which includes significantly increasing testing in all districts with a minimum of 70% RT-PCR tests and use of Rapid Antigen Tests as screening tests in densely populated areas as well as areas where fresh clusters are emerging; ramping up effective and timely tracing, containment and surveillance activities to curb the chain of transmission; effectively following the protocol of clinical care, treatment and supported home/facility care; effective enforcement of Covid-19 safe behaviour and time-bound plan of 100% vaccination of eligible population groups, especially in the high focus districts, according to the Press Information Bureau (PIB) statement. States have been particularly asked to increase dedicated beds by using available buildings in the hospital campus (including AIIMS) for creation of additional Covid-19 dedicated wards. The PIB said that the “health ministry is informing states every day in the morning of the day’s supply of Covid-19 vaccines, to enable better planning for optimum utilisation of the vaccines. An augmented health workforce would be needed in the coming days for contact tracing and house-to-house survey for symptomatic patients.” Chhattisgarh and Uttar Pradesh along with Maharashtra are the only three states in the country which have more than one lakh active cases. Both Chhattisgarh and Uttar Pradesh are reporting very high numbers of daily new Covid-19 cases and high deaths. “The reported shortage of hospital infrastructure such as ICU and oxygen supported hospitals beds resulting in difficulty to the public in easily accessing critical healthcare services were discussed in comprehensive detail, requiring an urgent ramping up of hospital infrastructure. The states were advised to increase the number of isolation beds, oxygen beds, ventilators/ICU beds, ambulance fleet as per requirement; plan for adequate oxygen supply; and focus on mortality reduction by early identification of positive cases and adherence to national treatment protocol,” said PIB statement. Bhushan informed the states that demand for oxygen cylinders (including 10 litre cylinders and 45 litre jumbo cylinders) and demand for additional ventilators (having high flow nasal canula) will be met very soon.

16-04-2021||India||Doctor talks about ‘horrors’ at Covid-19 hospitals, urges people to ‘wear masks'||A doctor took to social media on Friday to share the plight of healthcare workers at Covid-19 hospitals and the disturbing episodes they witness as people break down when told about the condition of their family members infected with the viral disease. As she spoke about her traumatic experience and reflected on how she could have been more tolerant and loving with the patients, Saandhra, in her now-viral Instagram post, urged the citizens of the country to “just wear your masks when you are out.”Follow latest updates on Covid-19 hereTalking about the events in the past two weeks, Saandhra wrote, “I've been telling people that their 22-year-old son has died, lying to patients, telling them theek ho jaoge (you will getter better), when I know to my bones vo theek nhi honge… (they won’t getter better), hearing breathless women crying allah allah in anguish all night.”A post shared by Saandhra (@_saandhra_)She mentioned one of the Covid-19 patients who was put on a ventilator and eventually died. “...the last words of one of our patients before my friend intubated her was that she has an 11 and 4-year-old at home, not to let her die (she died), telling children that they may not get their mother's body, mother's standing before us with folded hands asking us to save their children's lives,” Saandhra wrote in a heart-rending post. The doctor’s post comes at a time when India is reporting over two lakh cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) daily for the past two days and the total infection tally has surged past 14.29 million. Following the spike as the country is witnessing the second wave of Covid-19 infections, several states have imposed restrictions including night curfews and weekend lockdowns to prevent the disease from spreading. The states have also imposed heavy fines for people found without masks.Saandhra also spoke about the trauma doctors deal with and wished they continued to work hard as their family members may also need the support of healthcare workers if they get infected with Covid-19. “Working as hard as I can wishing other healthcare workers would do the same for my parents if they were to be hospitalized with covid… Coming back from my duty and crying about all of that I am forced to do/forced to watch… Crying about how I could have been a little more patient and a lot more loving to people who are suffocating to their deaths.. (6 hours in PPE all the while anxious about being exposed, anxious about dying just like our patients does not exactly leave you the sweetest person). To think that the pain I feel as a spectator is not even a quarter of the pain that our patients/their relatives feel,” the doctor wrote in her Instagram post.As governments mull partial lockdown in view of the rising Covid-19 cases, Saandhra says, “Trust me your lockdowns are not difficult…You haven't seen the horrors we see… I wish I could show you videos of the pain I see, just to scare everyone enough for you to stay inside…Saying that it's difficult is the understatement of the century... I do not want to see this pain... None of us do. Do not put us through this.”Acknowledging that it may not be possible for everyone to stay off work and be inside their homes for a long time, the doctor requested the people of the country to wear masks every time they step out.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/doctor-talks-about-horrors-at-covid-19-hospitals-urges-people-to-wear-masks-101618594884905.html

This was a policy decision taken by the then government,” stated the letter. “The move to change the names of the roads will insult Tamil personalities belonging to various political parties and create a tense and unrest situation in the state. May lead to further struggles and unrest,” it added.On Thursday, a three-member delegation of the DMK, led by organising secretary and MP RS Bharathi, submitted a representation to chief secretary Rajeev Ranjan urging him to intervene to roll back names of three arterial roads. They were named after Dravidian icons of the state such as EV Ramasamy, CN Annadurai and K Kamaraj but now bear English names.The AIADMK said that no names have been changed. “It seems the highways department used names from old records and during a routine job of installing name boards they have done this,” said AIADMK spokesperson and candidate C Vaigaichelvan. “We don’t have the power to do anything now. So after we form the government again we will take necessary steps,” he added. Vaigaichelvan dismissed DMK’s charges that this was done to appease their ally, the BJP. “BJP doesn’t tell us to change any names and we won’t do such things. We are also for Periyar. What do we have against these road names?” he said.Also read: TN govt agrees to hold online exams for arrear subjectsIn the past, both DMK and AIADMK have indulged in the name changing game of roads after Tamil scholars and personalities to evoke linguistic pride. Chennai’s Poonamallee high road was renamed in 1979 by AIADMK founder MG Ramachandran (MGR) to Periyar EVR high road after EV Ramasamy, the father of the Dravidian movement. Mount Road was renamed to Anna Salai and Beach Road as Kamarajar Salai. The names of these roads have now been changed to Grand Western Trunk Road, Grand Southern Trunk Road and Grand Northern Trunk Road. The DMK sought for the old names to be restored as signboards of the same have come up.“This action of changing the names of the roads, and the sheer disrespect to Tamil icons cutting across all parties, has brought uneasiness and unrest in the state and this may even lead to agitations and unrest,” Bharathi said in his letter. “It is quite apparent that the name change is done to please the ideologies of the AIADMK’s masters from the north, whose dislike of the Dravidian movement and its icon Thanthai Periyar is well known. They aim to ‘sanskritise’ and ‘saffronise’ everything.”Former Union minister P Chidambaram on Friday night tweeted that a smart government would immediately let leaders know that the names of the highways have not been changed. “The controversy should end tonight,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aiadmk-appeasing-masters-in-north-dmk-on-road-name-change-in-tn-101618591156229.html

However, whenever there are concerns, the state governments have discussed the issues with us and where there are containment zones, they are doing random tests and checks. The railways has all these details on the e-ticketing website and passengers are provided information on whether they have to undergo tests or carry a COVID-negative certificate on arrival," he said.Sharma also said the railways is doing a thermal screening of the passengers and has also notified the fine amounts for not following COVID protocols.He ruled out running Shramik Special trains and said trains will be run wherever there is demand and requirement.Sharma also said the price of platform tickets has been increased at several stations to discourage crowding."We have 4,000 isolation coaches for COVID-19 at different locations across the country. We have received a demand from Nandurbar in Maharashtra for over 100 coaches and 20 isolation coaches have been provided," he said when asked about the converted coaches that can act as COVID care centres.Sharma said the railways is keeping a close watch on all stations in Mumbai, Gujarat, Karnataka and wherever the demand is high, the zonal general managers have been authorised to operate more trains."I assure you that there is no dearth of services, the situation is quite normal, particularly in Mumbai, Surat and Bengaluru," he said.The Indian Railways is currently running 1,490 mail and express trains and 5,397 suburban train services on an average per day."We are also running 28 clone trains of highly-patronised trains and 947 passenger trains," Sharma said, adding that 70 per cent of the train services have been restored."To clear the extra rush across the country, the railways is operating 140 additional trains," he said.Sharma said the 140 special trains will make 483 trips in April and May.Citing the figures of the additional trains operating in several states, he said the Central Railway is operating 85 such services which will complete 284 trips, the Western Railway is operating 28 trains for 152 trips, the Northern Railway is operating 15 special trains for 19 trips, the East Central Railway is operating two special trains for four trips, the North Eastern Railway is operating nine trains for 14 trips and the North Central Railway is operating one train for 10 trips.Sharma also said trains for high-demand destinations such as Uttar Pradesh's Gorakhpur, Lucknow, Varanasi, Manduadih, Prayagraj, Bihar's Patna, Bhagalpur, Darbhanga, Barauni, Jharkhand's Bokaro, Ranchi, Assam's Guwahati and West Bengal's Kolkata are also being operated.The Railway Board chairman said the national transporter has operated 42 trains between Delhi and Mumbai from April 12 to 16.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-state-has-asked-to-stop-train-services-railway-board-chairman-101618583367453.html

Indian Genomic Consortium has so far processed more than 13,000 samples for Genome Sequencing,” the government said in a press release.The Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genomics Consortium (INSACOG) is a network of 10 laboratories established in December 2020 to continuously monitor the genomic changes of SARS-CoV-2 in India, through Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS), the release added.It further said that INSACOG guidelines were shared with states, which were also advised to send samples for genome sequencing along with clinical data of positive persons. This, the release said, would have helped INSACOG to discover other variants of concern, if present in the community. “However, several states, including Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Kerala have not shared such data, though others including Punjab and Delhi have,” the government said.The release also noted that detailed INSACOG guidelines were uploaded on the website of the Union ministry of health and family welfare (MoHFW) on December 27 last year. Out of the 13,614 WGS samples processed at the 10 designated INSACOG labs, 1,189 tested positive for “variants of concern” of SARS-CoV-2. Of these, 1,109 samples were positive with the UK variant, and 79 and one with the South African and Brazilian ones.“The RT-PCR tests being used in India do not miss these mutations as these tests being used in India target more than two genes. Sensitivity and specificity of the RT-PCR tests remain same as earlier,” the statement emphasised.According to the government-run Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), 263,476,625 samples have been tested for the viral disease till April 15. Of these, 1,473,210 samples were tested on April 15, ICMR said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rtpcr-tests-in-india-do-not-miss-any-variants-of-sars-cov-2-clarifies-govt-101618581682175.html
16-04-2021||India||UK home secretary Priti Patel approves Nirav Modi’s extradition||Almost two months after a UK court found fugitive businessman Nirav Modi guilty of fraud and money laundering in the Punjab National Bank scam and ordered his extradition to India, UK home secretary Priti Patel has approved the extradition, people familiar with the development said on Friday.The decision comes as a shot in the arm for the Indian government, which has been trying to bring fugitive economic offenders back to India, but Nirav Modi reserves a right to appeal his extradition in the high court, which his lawyer said would be the next course of action. Zulfiquar Memon, who represents Nirav Modi, told HT – “We will now go to the high court challenging the order of the Westminster Magistrate Court.”A UK Home Office spokesperson said: “On February 25, the District Judge gave judgment in the extradition case of Nirav Modi. The extradition order was signed on April 15.”Nirav Modi now has 14 days to make an application for leave to appeal to the High Court. He may seek leave to appeal against both the decisions of the District Judge and of the Home Secretary, people cited above said.While ordering his extradition on February 25, the Westminster District Judge Sam Goozee stated that Modi has a case to answer in India as he, along with his brother Nehal Modi and others, had defrauded the public sector bank, laundered the money taken from it and conspired to destroy evidence and intimidate witnesses.The judge had observed that the circulation of pearls, diamonds and gold between the Nirav Modi firms and the Dubai and Hong Kong based dummy companies was not genuine business and the companies were being used for transferring funds generated in the guise of sale-purchase/export-import of goods colloquially referred to as round tripping transactions.Modi’s contention that he won’t get a fair trial in India and that he was being targeted due to political reasons was junked by the court.A Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) official following the case said, “UK government signing the extradition order is a positive development. Even if he goes to a higher court, he doesn’t stand a chance as there is very strong evidence against him.”Nirav Modi is lodged in Wandsworth prison, on the outskirts of London, since March 19, 2019, when he was arrested on the basis of India’s extradition request.Modi’s is the second high-profile economic offender after former liquor baron Vijay Mallya whose extradition has been cleared by the trial court in the United Kingdom. Mallya lost his appeal against the extradition in April 2020 as well as any opportunity to approach the UK Supreme Court the next month but the British government has claimed that his extradition is held up due to a ‘confidential legal issue’.Officials familiar with Mallya’s case say he has applied for asylum in the UK and it is not known how much time British authorities will take to decide it.Like Vijay Mallya, the CBI and Enforcement Directorate (ED) investigators are confident that the UK high court will reject Nirav Modi’s plea too as there is irrefutable evidence of fraud and money laundering against him.TIMELINE:January 2018: Nirav Modi flees India along with his family after cheating Punjab National Bank of around ₹6,498 crore while his partner-in-crime, his uncle, Mehul Choksi – who siphoned of another ₹7,080 crore from PNB, is hiding in Antigua and Barbuda. Choksi’s extradition may take some time.July 27, 2018: India applied for Nirav Modi’s extradition for fraud and money laundering.March 19, 2019: Nirav Modi is arrested by Scotland Yard and sent to jail and is lodged in Wandsworth prison on the outskirts of London. He has never got bail in two years.May 2020: Full hearings pertaining to extradition of Modi begin in the Westminster’s’ Magistrate Court.February 25, 2021: The Magistrate Court orders extradition saying Nirav Modi has a case to answer and added he and his brother, Nehal Modi, and others, defrauded the public sector bank, laundered the money taken from it, and conspired to destroy evidence and intimidate witnesses. The case is sent to UK home secretary for consideration. She has two months to decide the extradition.April 15, 2021: Much before two month deadline, UK home secretary Priti Patel signed the extradition.During the trial, which went on for more than one year, the UK court rejected Modi’s lawyers’ argument and the testimony of experts, including retired Supreme Court judge Markandey Katju, that he would not get a fair trial in India and that he was being targeted due to political reasons.Describing Katju’s testimony as not reliable, the court said it had the “hallmarks of an outspoken critic with his own personal agenda”.The court also said Modi’s extradition is compatible with the Convention Rights within the meaning of the Human Rights Act 1998.What next? Nirav Modi has 14 days to appeal against the Westminster Court’s decision and Priti Patel’s approval in the UK high court.If his leave to file appeal is accepted, the high court will hear his arguments and decide the case. The whole process may take six months to one year.Post high court decision, if it comes in India’s favour, he can go to Supreme Court as well only if the high court allows him. In Vijay Mallya’s case, the UK high court had denied him permission to go to the Supreme Court.Post court appeals, Nirav Modi can also apply for asylum in the UK.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uk-home-secretary-priti-patel-approves-nirav-modi-s-extradition-101618582156083.html

Hearing a petition filed by Tresa Josefine, an engineering graduate, working with the Kerala Minerals and Metals Limited, a state PSU, challenging the provision put forward by it that for the post of the safety officer only men can apply, the court said such protective provisions cannot stand in the way of employment. The court later set aside the notification of the PSU and said it was violating provisions of the Article 14, 15 & 16 of the Constitution. “It is the bounden duty of respondents to take all appropriate steps to see that a woman worker is able to carry out duties assigned to her at all hours, safely and conveniently. Protective provisions cannot stand in the way of a woman not being considered for an employment for which she is otherwise eligible,” the single bench of Justice Anu Sivaraman observed. The petitioner was working as an engineering trainee at the PSU, when the post of the safety officer fell vacant. She was denied the opportunity citing night hours which she challenged. She contended that Section 66 (I) (B) of the Factories Act 1948 was violative of the Constitution_ the said provision mandates that no woman shall be required to work in any factory except between 6 am and 7 pm. The court observed that provisions of Section 66 (1) (B) are beneficial in nature and are intended to protect women from exploitation but it cannot be used as an excuse for denying a job to the woman.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/women-can-t-be-denied-jobs-citing-late-hours-rules-kerala-hc-101618577776180.html

On Thursday, the Empowered Group2 (EG2) ministers chaired a meeting and took several key decisions, including on the installation of oxygen plants, sanctioned under the PM-Cares fund, in 100 hospitals in far-flung areas.Also Read | Oxygen plants under PM-Cares to be installed in hospitals as Covid cases surgeIn the last two days, India has seen record new Covid-19 cases, crossing 200,000 mark on each day.

16-04-2021||India||Ajay Seth takes charge as economic affairs secretary||Ajay Seth, a 1987-batch Karnataka cadre officer of the Indian Administrative Service (IAS), on Friday took charge as economic affairs secretary. His appointment comes at a crucial time when India is witnessing the second wave of Covid-19 pandemic that is threatening to slow down economic recovery.Seth, who was previously the managing director of Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Limited, will now be responsible for the execution of the government’s efforts to insulate the economy from the adverse impact of the second Covid-19 wave.The new economic affairs secretary will coordinate the policy efforts of various arms of the government, the central bank and states to ensure that the projected growth path of the economic recovery is maintained, one official said, requesting anonymity. Although there is unlikely to be a nationwide lockdown during the second wave, local and state-level lockdowns, particularly in economic hubs such as Maharashtra, will adversely impact the economy.Also Read | How will the second Covid wave affect India’s economy?India’s economy shrank by 24.4% in the first quarter of 2020-21, which bore the brunt of a 68-day lockdown imposed to slow the spread of coronavirus disease, and 7.3% in the second, before entering growth territory and expanding by 0.4% in the last three months of 2020 (ending December 31). Overall, it is expected that the economy will contract by 8% in 2020-21. According to an estimate of the Reserve Bank of India, the economy is expected to grow at 10.5% in 2021-22, with a quarterly path of 26.2% in Q1, 8.3% in Q2, 5.4% in Q3, and 6.2% in Q4.Seth is expected to take stock of sectors that will be adversely affected due to the second wave of the pandemic and help the government in framing both fiscal and monetary policies to boost growth, the person mentioned above said. The economic affairs secretary plays a crucial role in the country’s monetary and market-related policies as he is the bridge between the Union government and regulators such as RBI and the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi). The department of expenditure (DEA), one of the five arms of the Union finance ministry, is the nodal department for the execution of the government’s efforts to boost the economy, implement policies to enhance domestic and international investments, and prepared budget-related proposals.In a bureaucratic reshuffle last week, DEA secretary Tarun Bajaj was made the new revenue secretary, while Seth was brought in from his home cadre to manage economic affairs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ajay-seth-takes-charge-as-economic-affairs-secretary-101618563734762.html
16-04-2021||India||Manipur HC scraps MLA’s election, declares candidate in second position winner||The Manipur high court has declared the election of Okram Henry Singh from Wangkhei assembly constituency in 2017 assembly elections as null and void over submitting incorrect and incomplete information in affidavit with his nomination papers, and has named Y Erabot Singh, who secured the second place in the elections, as the elected MLA.A single bench of justice MV Muralidaran passed the verdict on Thursday on a petition filed by Y Erabot Singh.The petition alleged that Henry had violated the provision of the Representation of People Act 1951 during the nomination process.Sources in Imphal said the final hearing in the case was held on March 17 and its judgment was pronounced on April 15.Also Read | Manipur University student found Covid-positive after taking exam on campusHenry, 32, contested the assembly election in 2017 as an Indian National Congress candidate and was declared the MLA from Wangkhei constituency after winning the seat with 16,753 votes while Erabot, a Bharatiya Janata Party(BJP) candidate, got 12,417 votes.Later, Henry joined the BJP, resulting in his disqualification as MLA.In the verdict, the court said that Henry was supposed to provide in the affidavit details of the name of his spouse and dependents, and those of his pending criminal cases and educational qualification.“... but for reasons best known to him, (he) failed to disclose the said information. Non-disclosure of the material information of the Respondent No. 1 (Henry) amounts to violation of the Representation of Peoples Act, 1951 and rules thereof, and hence his election is fit to be declared as null and void,” it said.Henry recently moved the Supreme Court seeking a direction to the Election Commission to hold by-poll in Wangkhei constituency. However, the apex court on April 7 told him to approach the state high court.It may be worth mentioning here that this is the second time the Manipur high court has passed such an order recently.In a similar case in November last year, the court also declared the election of Y Surchandra from Kakching assembly constituency in 2017 assembly elections as null and void over non-disclosure of information in his election affidavit and named M Rameshwar, who secured the second place in the elections, as the elected MLA.

16-04-2021||India||Vaccination not shield against Covid, can reduce severity: Experts||Amid cases of the coronavirus infection being reported post vaccination from a few parts of the country, experts have said inoculation against COVID-19 "does not produce a shield" against the deadly virus, but helps reduce the severity of the infection and chances of death.They have also said that "no causal link has been established" yet between vaccination and the complications suffered thereafter by a person through any clinical or epidemiological studies.From Delhi to Chennai and even in tier-2 cities like Patna, cases of vaccination beneficiaries contracting the coronavirus infection have been reported in the last couple of months.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageThirty-seven doctors at the Sir Ganga Ram Hospital in Delhi have tested positive for COVID-19 since the latest surge in cases, five of whom were admitted for treatment, hospital sources said last week.Many of them had taken both doses of the Covieshield vaccine, the sources said.A 54-year-old sanitation worker in Delhi died from health complications on February 22."My father had received his first shot of Covieshield on February 17. That day, when he returned home, he started feeling uneasy and the very next day, he was running temperature, which lasted for two-three days," his son Dheeraj had said.He had said his father continued to go to work despite the "weakness post vaccination", collapsed while being on duty and died at a hospital later.In Chennai, a vaccination beneficiary, who had got his first shot on March 15, tested positive for COVID-19 on March 29. He was hospitalised on March 30 and died on April 4, raising concerns among the family members on the efficacy of the vaccine.While cases of minor adverse events following immunisation (AEFIs) have been reported in various parts of the country, in some cases, it has been major too, leading to hospitalisation.The Centre, however, has maintained that both Covieshield and Covaxin are safe to take, and urged people not to get swayed by rumours.Several experts have concurred that vaccination against COVID-19 "does not produce a shield" against the deadly virus, but helps reduce the severity of the infection and chances of death."We know of cases of the infection reported post vaccination, even after taking two doses. But these cases are largely where the beneficiaries have had very mild symptoms. The vaccine at least reduces the severity of the infection and chances of mortality," Dr Avdhesh Bansal, a pulmonologist at the Apollo hospital here, said.Also, the full efficacy of the vaccine comes in only after two doses, he added.Dr Richa Sareen, consultant, pulmonology at the Fortis hospital here, echoed Bansal, saying, "The anti-bodies fully kick in only after both the doses have been taken. So a person getting infected after the first dose is possible, if exposed to a source of infection."A senior doctor at a Delhi government hospital, on the condition of anonymity, said "the vaccine is not a full safety shield", but wearing masks can complement the fight against the virus, which is mutating in multiple ways."Many people after getting vaccinated think that now they are immune to getting the infection. So they either do not wear a mask or wear it improperly. The virus first attacks the nasal passage and then the chest region. So if the mouth and the nostrils are exposed, chances are high that a person, after vaccination, may still get infected," he said.Also, the individual immunity level and associated co-morbidities could be a factor when it comes to getting infected after the first or the second dose of the vaccine, the doctor said, adding, "Our mask is our best vaccine now."While medical and pharmaceutical industry experts debate over the efficacy of vaccines, many doctors conjecture that as the coronavirus has been mutating, it will affect the efforts to detect the infection, develop vaccination and capability to develop herd immunity.So far, a UK strain, Brazil and South African variants and a double mutant of the virus have been reported in Delhi.Vaccination of healthcare workers began in India since the launch of the inoculation drive on January 16 and then it was opened in phases to the elderly and those in the 45-59 age group with co-morbidities, with the Centre eventually allowing all aged above 45 to be eligible for immunisation against COVID-19.The post-vaccination infection has brought trauma to the family members of the patients, who were hoping to get some reprieve after getting the shots.Former IT cell head of the BJP and ex-CEO of MyGov Arvind Gupta on Friday wrote on Twitter: "#Vaccine being put to test in our family. All taken Dose2 1. Patient 1 - Infected +- 7 days. In hospital with mild-moderate symptoms 2. Patient 2 - Infected +- 9 days. At home with high fever & cough 3. Patient 3 - Infected +- 14 days. At home with ~100F fever @MoHFW_INDIA."Hyderabad-based doctor Lakshmi Lavanya Alapati replied to his tweet on the microblogging platform, saying, "After both doses are admi­nistered, antibodies develop and severity of infection and chances of death are lowered. There is a 85% reduction in chances of hospitali­sation after vaccination. But vaccines cannot prevent the virus to enter your body - only mask can stop virus entry."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vaccination-not-shield-against-covid-can-reduce-severity-experts-101618563246984.html

This is the second time that the chief minister contracted the infection. In August 2020, he was infected for the first time, along with several of his family members.The 78-year-old CM complained of running a fever for the last two days following which he got tested on Thursday. Now, he will be shifted to Manipal hospital, CMO sources have confirmed.Follow Covid-19 Live updatesHe was tested two days ago when his result came negative, reports said.Upon having mild fever, today I got tested for Covid-19 and my report has come out positive. Although I am doing fine, I am being hospitalised based on the advise of doctors. I request all those who have come in my contact recently to be observant and exercise self-quarantine.In March, the chief minister took the first dose of the vaccine at Bengaluru's Victoria Hospital when several other state chief ministers took their jabs after the vaccination drive was open for senior citizens. He was due to take the second dose in a few days. After he was admitted to the hospital for Covid-19 treatment, the CM tweeted saying he is doing fine and doesn't have any symptom apart from mild fever. He also urged those who came in close contact with him in the past few days to go into self-isolation.Yediyurappa called an emergency meeting on Friday at his residence to discuss the Covid-19 situation of the state, as the state is recording the sharpest single-day spike of fresh Covid-19 cases. On Wednesday, Karnataka reported 14,738 new infections and 66 fatalities.Amid the raging second wave of the pandemic, concerns over reinfections are gaining ground as several such cases have been reported, though the Union health ministry has not confirmed reinfection. However, an investigative study by the Indian Council of Medical Research has found reinfection in 4.5 per cent of those who earlier contracted the disease. Yeddyurappa's 2nd-time infection is being seen as a rare case of this reinfection.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-cm-yediyurappa-tests-positive-for-covid-19-for-2nd-time-101618563329770.html

16-04-2021||India||April 29 meeting shores up hopes on India-EU trade, investment talks next month||Union commerce minister Piyush Goyal will hold a virtual meeting with Valdis Dombrovskis, the European Commission executive vice-president and commissioner of trade, on April 29, brightening the prospects for a firm start of negotiations on an India-European Union broad-based trade and investment agreement, people familiar with the matter said.This is their second meeting in less than three months; the first was on February 5 when Piyush Goyal hosted the first India-EU high-level dialogue, or HLD, where the two sides had extensively discussed the state of play of India-EU bilateral trade and investment relations and the way forward. At this discussion also, Dombrovskis had reiterated the EU’s interest in resuming negotiations for ambitious, comprehensive and mutually beneficial trade and investment agreements.New Delhi expects the resumption of negotiations for the India-EU trade and the investment agreement at the India-EU Summit scheduled to be held on May 8 in Portugal’s Porto given the broad-based support to the pact within the EU. There is, however, a possibility that the summit could be advanced by a day to May 7 due to a change in French President Emmanuel Macron’s sked.The topic had come up for discussion during the visit of French Foreign Minister Jean Yves Le Drian as well; he added weight to the forward movement by reassuring his Indian counterparts that Paris is committed to supporting the deal. The India-EU trade pact also came up during Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Dutch counterpart Mark Rutte’s summit-level meeting last week. Both sides expressed hope for early resumption of negotiations.Indian officials suggest that the two sides have decided to hold negotiations on separate trade and investment pacts since they believe it will be easier to seal an agreement on investments. India’s investment agreements with most of the 27 members of the EU expired during 2017-18, leading to higher costs of investment and some uncertainty among European investors.Officials said the contentious issues related to market access for an all-encompassing free trade agreement will take more time to be addressed.The India-EU trade negotiations were launched in June 2007 but have been stalled since May 2013, when both sides failed to bridge the gaps on issues related to data security and sustainable development.But this time both sides are more accommodating with the UK post-Brexit looking for a bilateral free trade agreement with India during Prime Minister Boris Johnson visit to India on April 25.Officials acknowledge that there may be some uncertainty around the format of the India-EU Summit, which was to mark the resumption of negotiations for the trade and investment pacts, due to the surge in coronavirus cases As things stand, the plan is that PM Modi is scheduled to Portugal for the summit to be held in Porto, its second-largest metropolis after Lisbon, before flying to France for a crucial bilateral visit.An official said the final call on holding the in-person summit is yet to be taken in view of the surge in Covid cases though all the leaders are vaccinated against Covid-19 and the situation in Portugal is considered to be under controlPortugal, according to news agency Reuters, imposed a lockdown in January to curb what was then the world’s worst Covid-19 surge but has started lifting restrictions from March, reopening some schools, restaurant and cafe terraces, museums and hair salons.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indiaeu-to-start-groundwork-for-talks-on-trade-investment-deals-on-april-29-101618559820117.html

16-04-2021||India||Bengal has been committed to secularism in a way that’s remarkable: Amartya Sen||Ahead of the fifth of eight phase assembly elections in West Bengal on Saturday, Nobel laureate Amartya Sen spoke to Sunetra Choudhury about the elections and the issues involved. Edited excerpts from the interview:How closely have you been following the Bengal elections?There is a lot of time difference between Kolkata and where I stay right now [Harvard]. So as closely as possible, I do try to follow these elections.Also watch: Amartya Sen on why BJP’s attracting Dalit and backward voters | On The Record﻿The elections are largely seen as a battle for Bengal’s soul wherein all the parties are claiming to be representatives of real Bengal. What do you make of this electoral fight?Well, it’s an extraordinary fight and there can’t be any other occasion when an election in a state has generated so much interest, given the unusual amount of importance that the Central government has given it. On the other hand, it’s not so unusual that the local Bengalis think the elections really are an important thing. The two together have caused a confrontation rare in the history of elections anywhere in the world.Also Read | ‘Criminal negligence’: Mahua Moitra slams EC over 8-phase WB polls amid Covid-19Why are Bengal elections associated with violence? The fear of violence was also cited by Election Commission (EC) to have the elections over eight phases...I don’t think it is because Bengal is more violent. I think the EC wanted it divided and if you see how the election is going, where the Prime Minister goes away and does a little bit of work for his Prime Ministerial role and then comes back in time for another part of the elections. This is something in which the Central government clearly has some ability to participate in every activity in a way that would not have been possible if it were a one-day election or a two-day election. Now, I don’t know whether that was the reason for EC doing it in this form. A lot of people in Bengal are rather critical of the Election Commission, the way law and order situation has gone. Even in the firing [during the fourth phase of polling], four Bengalis, all Muslims were killed. I’m not going into that story. But it is not the case that it’s only the issue of peace in Bengal and the absence of it that makes Bengal prone to having...eight-phase [elections]...rather than for similarly sized places that have it in one or two-day scenario. There’s an element of political reasoning involved in it, and we could discuss that too....I don’t know that traditionally Bengal has had more bloodshed in elections. There have been many fights over Bengal over the years if you think of the history of the British Empire. The British Empire was established in Bengal in the Battle of Plassey. There were fights going on between Siraj ud-Daulah, the last King of Bengal, and the British. Then in the Indian national movement, a lot of the violence in trying to get the British out had its roots in Bengal. So, there’s a historical tradition too.Bengal is divided between Hindus and Muslims that has not been traditionally a big divider. On the contrary, if you go back to the beginning of Bengali culture and literature, in the 10th century, you will see an intermingling of Hindus and Muslims... The main epics, the Ramayana and Mahabharata, the main translating initiative came from the Muslim King in Bengal who was very fond of the epics. There has been a tradition of Hindu-Muslim unity from time to time... The British were quite keen on a division between Hindus and Muslims. It used to be called divide and rule. A certain amount of that going on now if you take a thing like the new citizenship act. That is not popular among Muslims as they don’t have rights that the Hindus are given in this. That generates not only discontent among Muslims but also Hindus who are very strongly involved with the cause of secularism.After all, Bengal with Rabindranath Tagore and Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose has been committed to secularism in a way that’s quite remarkable... so any violation where only Muslims are shot in a particular incident involving police from outside, or a major party trying to win elections with the party leader saying, “we don’t expect Muslims to vote for us”. Why not? That raises all kinds of questions. So, there are reasons for tension that we have to think about. And these are not necessarily to the detriment of the civilization of Bengal. Secularism has been a very big cause in Bengal. Our most famous poet is Rabindranath Tagore but the next one is Kazi Nazrul Islam. And the magazine in which he used to publish had as its masthead a Bengali poem from the 15th century which said: “Above everything, a human being and there’s nothing above that”. ...secularism is very much on the ground, on the battlefield in these elections.BJP no doubt uses polarisation, but election strategist Prashant Kishore has acknowledged that TMC and Congress had only tried to appease Muslims and now Hindus wanted to vote for a party that was looking at their interests. Do you agree with this?It seems like an approximate history. Bengal has been a divided ground for a long time. When the British partitioned it early in the 20th century and wanted a Muslim part separated out, they hoped that there would be support from the Muslims in Bengal to having a part in which their numerical dominance would be acknowledged. What did the Bengalis do? Bengalis, both Hindus, and Muslims, were totally against it. One of the poems about the unity of Bengal “Amar Sonar Bangla” became later the national anthem of Bangladesh. Given that Muslims have been traditionally a lot poorer than Hindus in Bengal, which has been demonstrated by various studies, there is a need for justice in dealing with it, in looking after the poor, in looking after those at the rougher end of the pyramid of justice. This is important as people like Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose always pointed out. It is important to see who the poor in a region are and what can be done to help them. Now some of the concern with Muslims came for the same reason as the concern for Mataus, Namasudra, and the Hindu lower caste or the Hindu-related tribal population of Bengal.So, I think the whole idea of Muslims having done it, and now it was the time for Hindus to teach them a lesson, is just a part of the propaganda of a party inspired by Hindutva thoughts. And whoever says it is making a mistake because you have to look at people in terms of privilege and under-privilege. Indian government itself has made Muslims underprivileged so if you are being maltreated outside India, you cannot ask for a home in India as Hindus can. In these circumstances, you have to look at a fuller picture.Also watch | 8 phases not due to violence threat but political: Amartya Sen | On The RecordYou spoke about the lower caste communities and the underprivileged, the BJP counts them as their voters. They also voted for them in Uttar Pradesh and in the 2019 general elections. What would explain that?That’s a very interesting question because what happens electorally is not just a matter of what preceding justice was in a particular area. It depends so much on the organisational facility. One of the interesting things to look at far away from Bengal or UP would be say Kerala. Kerala had more untouchability, more caste division than almost anywhere else in India. And yet, because of ultimate organisation, in this case by the Left, the caste situation changed radically over time. And it was possible for the Communist Party, which ignored these caste divisions, to get support from all the castes. We must not ignore the enormous role that political organisation plays.Hindutva has been a very dynamic political movement. I may not agree with them, but I certainly admire many of their organisational feats and they were successful not in all the elections. ...As happened in some tribal areas, for example, take Tripura, the tribal population could be captured by BJP... We have to look at these organisational sides. That’s why if you were to ask the question, if Bengal is so secular, how come a Hindu party, whether they win or not, could be counted as a possibility? That’s because of the organisation. I don’t think we have ever seen an election in which we have seen so much attention paid from the Centre. Not only the Prime Minister but the [Union] Home minister [Amit Shah] and CM of the largest state of India [Yogi Adityanath] coming every other day, as it were, but also spending a lot more money. BJP has a lot more money to spend and is making good use of that. So, I think I would tend to look at it that way, that is neither a reason for hopelessness saying there’s nothing we can do. If you believe in your principles including that of secularism and non-divisive justice, you have to work for it. You have to work for it in a way that your own principles resonate better with all the groups, whether they be Muslims or Hindus, Dalits or non-Dalits.Do you think certain crucial mistakes were made by the state government?There may well have been, I haven’t studied it in particular. There are also achievements. The Bengali peasants still have a better health condition than the Gujarati peasants, despite being poorer. There are some delivery issues, but distribution has worked quite well and so on. There are mistakes made, for example, the way farmers are treated in India, but that doesn’t mean that the farmers are lost forever to the Central government. They still manage to win elections at the central level. So, it’s not such a simple thing because it’s very easy to point out mistakes but when we are doing political analysis, we have to search for the truth, and we have to have some humility also. What looks immediately like an answer, may not be an answer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-has-been-committed-to-secularism-in-a-way-that-s-quite-remarkable-amartya-sen-101618558274488.html

The state 2 that Gandhi mentioned was in the context of PM Modi’s appeal to the public to ring bells and thalis during Janta curfew last year.A day ago, Gandhi had mocked the PM-Cares Fund by alleging that there weren’t enough hospital beds, ventilators or oxygen, and yet, there was a sham of a festival. In a letter addressed to PM, Gandhi had also criticised the Centre for the poor implementation of the vaccination programme by exporting the vaccines and thereby creating “vaccine starvation” in the country.Earlier, in a meeting held with the Congress-led states, Congress chief Sonia Gandhi had also blamed the Centre for mismanagement of the situation in the country.The country has been witnessing a sharp increase in Covid cases with a daily tally of 217,353 new infections taking India’s total tally to 1,569,743.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tughlaqi-lockdown-says-rahul-gandhi-as-he-slams-centre-over-covid-strategy-101618557914504.html

16-04-2021||India||Covid-19 vaccine: One dose isn't enough. Govt explains why you need both||The Centre on Friday released a video on why citizens need to take two doses of the vaccine against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) to keep themselves and their loved ones safe. Dr Randeep Guleria, director of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in New Delhi, explained the importance of getting two doses of the Covid-19 vaccine. The clip issued on the Press Information Bureau’s (PIB)'s Twitter account.#COVID19Vaccine Is the first dose enough? No, 2 doses are essential to give us protection. Learn why & get yourself or your loved ones vaccinated And remind your loved ones to get their 2nd dose promptly#Unite2FightCorona @MIB_India @ddsahyadrinews @airnews_mumbai pic.twitter.com/2z34RRPyfwThe AIIMS chief said the first Covid-19 vaccine dose, known as the "prime dose", prepares the human immune system to build antibodies. However, these antibodies that are generated with the first dose won't last for a long time and will gradually wane with time, according to the senior doctor. After the second dose, called the "booster dose”, the immune system receives the boost to produce a large number of antibodies, Dr Guleria said, adding that it gives good "cell-mediated immunity", another defence mechanism against the coronavirus infection."It also stimulates what we call your memory cells so that the body remembers this infection for the long-term and is able to quickly produce anti-bodies later on as well if you get this infection,” the AIIMS director said. Dr Guleria urged citizens to get the two essential doses of the Covid-19 vaccine for optimum protection against the coronavirus disease.The Union ministry of health and family welfare, in its official Covid-19 related guidelines, states that an individual needs to take two doses of the vaccine, 28 days apart, to complete the vaccination schedule since protective levels of antibodies are generally developed two weeks after receiving the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. The guidelines by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) also recommend taking the second vaccine dose as close to the required interval as possible. If the second dose cannot be taken within the specified timeframes, it can be given up to six weeks (42 days) after the first dose as well, CDC’s guidelines state. It is not yet known if delaying the second dose longer than the aforementioned timeframe has an impact on the immune system's response to the coronavirus.Meanwhile, India extended its record daily run of new Covid-19 infections on Friday, with 217,353 fresh cases, according to the Union health ministry. This marks the eighth record daily increase in the last nine days and took total cases to nearly 14.3 million.

The Election Commission (EC) had banned him from campaigning for 48 hours for violating the poll code.“If central forces were attacked, they would again shoot. The statement, which I had made, has now been echoed by a poll panel observer. I am telling yet again. If central forces are attacked and people are obstructed from casting their votes, central forces should open fire. It doesn’t matter who gets killed ... The main objective is that the polling should be peaceful and violence-free,” Sinha said while addressing a rally at Habra in North 24 Parganas on Thursday afternoon.

He talks all nonsense. He knows that he is going to lose and is hence talking through his hat to grab attention. We will bring this to the notice of the EC and urge the panel to ban him for the entire poll period till April 29. He is not fit to speak in public,” said Jyotipriyo Mullick, state minister and senior Trinamool Congress (TMC) leader. The EC on Thursday also banned Dilip Ghosh, BJP’s president in West Bengal, from campaigning for 24 hours for his remarks on Sitalkuchi firing.

16-04-2021||India||The 1994 espionage case that led to Isro scientist Nambi Narayanan's arrest||The Supreme Court on Thursday ordered a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) probe into the conspiracy behind the alleged framing of former Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) scientist Nambi Narayanan in a 1994 espionage case.Terming the matter as ‘serious’, the bench headed by Justice AM Khanwilkar ruled that the matter required ‘deeper investigation’ into the role of the officers responsible for the false implication of the former space scientist.What was the espionage case?In 1994, Kerala police arrested Isro scientist Nambi Narayanan for alleged espionage over the allegations of transfer of certain confidential documents on India's space programme to foreign countries.The case came to the light after a Maldivian national named Rasheeda was arrested in Thiruvananthapuram in October 1994 for allegedly obtaining secret drawings of Isro rocket engines to sell it to Pakistan.Narayanan was arrested along with the then Isro deputy director D Sasikumaran, and Fousiya Hasan, a Maldivian friend of Rasheeda.After two years of investigation, Narayanan was given clean-chit by CBI following a closure report in 1996. The investigation agency blamed state police officials and the then intelligence bureau deputy director RB Shreekumar for implicating the scientist.In 2018, the top court directed a high-level panel to probe the role of police officials and ordered the Kerala government to award ₹50 lakh in compensation to Narayanan for wrongful incarceration. The court called the police action against the former Isro scientists as a ‘psycho-pathological treatment’. In its order, the top court said, the scientist’s "liberty and dignity", basic to his human rights, were jeopardised as he was taken into custody and, eventually, despite all the glory of the past, was compelled to face "cynical abhorrence".On April 5 this year, the central government approached the Supreme Court seeking consideration of a report filed by a committee regarding the role of police officials in the 1994 case.What Narayanan said:The 79-year-old Narayanan said that the Kerala police had "fabricated" the case. He also claimed that the technology that he was accused of stealing did not even exist at that time.Political fallout of the case:A section of the Congress leaders targeted the then chief minister of Kerala, late K Karunakaran, over his alleged involvement in the case. It eventually led Karunakaran to resign from his post.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/the-1994-espionage-case-that-led-to-isro-scientist-nambi-narayanan-s-arrest-101618555565896.html

After two years of above average rain, we are likely to receive normal monsoon rain this year,” said M Rajeevan, secretary, ministry of earth sciences (MoES). The LPA is the average rainfall recorded during 1961 to 2010 which is 88cm. IMD considers rainfall between 96% to 104% of LPA to be in “normal” range.The 2020 and 2019 monsoon was “above normal” at 110% and 109% of LPA respectively. During 1996, 1997 and 1998, monsoon was normal for three consecutive years at 103.4%; 102.2% and 104% respectively. La Niña conditions, which started in 2020, have started weakening, Rajeevan said. “La Niña conditions are likely to prevail only till May so we will transition to ENSO neutral conditions during monsoon. There is very little chance of El Niño conditions developing during monsoon months. There is a very small probability of Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) negative condition developing during monsoon. So these conditions are likely to lead to a normal monsoon this year,” Rajeevan explained.Also Read | Pre-monsoon rain deficiency hits statesEl Niño and the Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is a periodic fluctuation in sea surface temperature and the air pressure of the overlying atmosphere across the equatorial Pacific Ocean according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).ENSO has a major influence on weather and climate patterns and leads to heavy rains, floods and drought. El Niño has a warming influence on global temperatures, whilst La Niña has the opposite effect. In India for example, El Niño is associated with drought or weak monsoon while La Niña is associated with strong monsoon and above average rain and colder winters.IOD is characterised by warmer sea surface temperature in the equatorial Indian Ocean; positive IOD conditions are usually associated with normal or above normal monsoon.A large part of east and northeast India including Jharkhand, Odisha, Bihar and the northeastern states are likely to record below normal rains this year according to IMD’s analysis.Monsoon is likely to be “normal” or “above normal” for the third consecutive year, according to private weather forecasting company Skymet Weather’s preliminary monsoon forecast for 2021. The forecast said monsoon rain from June to September is likely to be 103% of the long period average of 880.6mm.“The onset month of June and the withdrawal phase of September is assuring good countrywide rainfall distribution,” Skymet Weather said in a statement on Tuesday. In June, July and August, rainfall is likely to be “normal” with higher probability of “above normal” rain in September according to the forecast.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/monsoon-likely-to-be-normal-at-98-of-long-period-average-imd-101618555694722.html

In total, the government had filed three cases against the probe agency and also announced a judicial probe against it.One of the cases was based on the statement of accused Sandeep Nair, in which he said there was pressure on him to implicate the state government and the CM in the smuggling case. Earlier, according to another case filed by the state police, main accused Swapna Suresh alleged that the CM, three of his ministers and the Speaker were aware of the smuggling activities through the consulate.On Monday, the ED approached the HC and demanded that the FIRs be quashed as its officials were 'intimidated' and it was a ploy to weaken the gold smuggling case. The main accused, including Swapna Suresh and Sandeep Nair, are in custody after being detained under Cofeposa (Conservation of Foreign Exchange and Prevention of Smuggling Activities Act).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2-firs-filled-by-kerala-police-against-ed-quashed-by-high-court-101618555142020.html

16-04-2021||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||A young population, previous exposure to other coronaviruses, and some amount of resilience in warding off or fighting the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes Covid-19 may have all helped India flatten the curve of the first wave of the coronavirus disease pandemic, from a peak of 93,617 (seven-day average on September 16) to a low of 10,988 (seven-day average on February 11), but the three most significant factors were not any of these.These were, in no particular order, non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), mostly to do with behaviour (masking, hand-washing, social distancing) and restrictions on movement and activities; the test-trace-isolate-treat protocol that most states and territories adopted; and the fear of getting infected. It was the last that made people stay at home, not socialise, put off weddings or keep them really small, and generally behave as if going out would endanger their lives as well as the lives of those they lived with (in truth, it would have), and that it was not worth it.Over time, the benefits of all of these kicked in, India launched a vaccine drive, and everyone thought the battle was won. States and UTs went easy on testing, tracing, and isolating; the Union government as well as the states relaxed restrictions on movement and activities, and stopped monitoring compliance with other NPIs; and, driven by a potent mix of complacence and Covid-fatigue, people let their guards down. As I first wrote on June 21 last year (#87 of my first wave of columns): “So, bored, tired, lonely perhaps, and physically, mentally, and emotionally weary, we let things slip. And the virus wins.”Which is exactly what is playing out now. Based on health ministry’s data, India registered more than 200,000 daily new cases in the 24 hours to Thursday morning, with the actual number likely to be 10 times as high. Some worthies would like people to take comfort in the fewer deaths this time around, but as Jamie Mullick, who has probably done the best data journalism around the pandemic, wrote in HT, assuming a steady case fatality rate of 1.1%, it is clear that the death rate is inching up. This is best illustrated in his chart mapping the trajectory of cases (blue) and deaths (red). Reports coming in from some parts of India seem to suggest that the actual number of deaths could be higher. That’s entirely possible. Assuming that India was reporting deaths accurately in the first wave, and an infection fatality rate (deaths as a proportion of infections) of 0.1% (Dispatch 152 , published on September 8, explains how I arrived at this number), 2 million cases a day translates to 2,000 deaths. If all cases of Covid-19 are not being recorded, it stands to reason that all deaths on account of Covid-19 are also not being counted. Most states and UTs have also been quite brazen in their violation of an Indian Council of Medical Research guideline from last year requiring that a test be conducted on those suspected to have died from Covid-19.The big gap in our knowledge is whether the sudden surge in cases is being caused only by the factors discussed above, or if mutant strains of the virus (the co-called variants of concern) are at play. That is something only genome sequencing can tell us, and we are not doing enough of it. Still, NPIs will clearly work even when the infections are being caused by VOCs. So, what should India do now?One, everyone, governments, political leaders (if a private car can be considered a public space, what can be said of the stage for a political rally?), and all of us, need to get serious about NPIs.Two, governments need to accelerate testing (there’s simply nothing to be gained if the waiting time for a result is 2-3 days), tracing, and isolating.Three, the vaccine drive needs to be expanded and accelerated, which would entail ensuring more supplies, and dynamically redefining eligibility criteria.And four, India, which is one of the world’s leaders in the manufacture of small molecule drugs (even more than it is in vaccines), should start working with companies on some very promising lines of therapy. More on this in the next instalment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-what-you-need-to-know-today-101618541908213.html

16-04-2021||India||Delhi HC denies bail to Shahrukh Pathan, who pointed gun at cop during riots||The Delhi high court on Thursday dismissed a bail plea by Shahrukh Pathan, who allegedly pointed a pistol at a police head constable during the riots that broke out in north-east Delhi in February last year, saying “the video clips have shaken the court’s conscience”.Justice Suresh Kait said Pathan was not just part of a mob of rioters but he was leading the crowd. “It is hard to believe that the accused had no knowledge that his act may harm anyone present at the spot. The role attributed to the petitioner is not confined to participation in the mob of rioters but of heading the large crowd, holding a pistol in hand and releasing open fire shots,” the judge said.“...In the opinion of this court, the learned trial court has rightly held that the petitioner is alleged to have participated in riots and his picture speaks a volume about his involvement. Keeping in mind the gravity of offence committed by the petitioner as also the facts of the present case, I am not inclined to grant bail to the petitioner (Pathan),” said the judge.A picture of Pathan, 24, showing him pointing a pistol at an unarmed Delhi Police head constable, Deepak Dahiya, during the communal violence last year in Seelampur, went viral on social media. He was arrested on March 3 last year from Uttar Pradesh’s Shamli district.The police registered a case against him alleging that on February 24 last year, Pathan was party to the huge crowd which had pelted stones, petrol bombs and fired gunshots on the road between Jafrabad Metro station and Maujpur Chowk.The court also took strong note of some of the contents mentioned in the petition, which it said are not worth disclosing.Pathan sought bail on grounds that there was a 50-hour delay in lodging the case against him as the alleged incident took place on February 24, 2020, and the FIR was registered on February 26.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-hc-denies-bail-to-shahrukh-pathan-who-pointed-gun-at-cop-during-riots-101618540381294.html

16-04-2021||India||CBI to probe conspiracy against ex-Isro scientist||The Supreme Court on Thursday ordered a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) into the conspiracy behind framing former Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) scientist Nambi Narayanan in a spy case in 1994.The bench, headed by justice AM Khanwilkar, termed the matter “serious”, and required “deeper investigation” into the role of the officers responsible for the false implication of the former space scientist.Accepting the report by a committee appointed by the court in 2018, the bench said that CBI will be at liberty to use the contents of the report for registration of a preliminary enquiry (PE) to carry out further investigation.Former Supreme Court judge DK Jain was entrusted with the task of holding an inquiry into the circumstances that led to framing of Narayanan, now 79, and his arrest by the Kerala police in 1994 in an espionage case in which he was exonerated two years later following a closure report by CBI.Referring to the report, the bench, which also included justices Dinesh Maheshwari and Krishna Murari, said that the report did reveal that “everything was not hunky dory” and that the facts disclosed “acts of omission and commission by some officers of the state”.The bench added that the report has recommended that CBI should register a PE and conduct a thorough investigation so that criminal liability could be fastened on some officers identified by the committee who were “responsible for the situation”.The bench then recorded in its order that CBI will proceed in accordance with the law, and is at liberty to treat the report as a preliminary report. It said that CBI shall submit an action taken report in the court within three months to apprise the bench of the progress in the case.Narayanan welcomed the court order. “I welcome the verdict. I would like to know who all played behind the conspiracy that delayed our cryogenic project. The technology should have been in use by 1999, but it was delayed by 15 years. Let the truth come out,” he said in Thiruvananthapuram.During the proceedings, Sibi Mathews, former director general of the police of Kerala, who was identified by CBI as one of the officers responsible for concocting the case, complained that justice Jain did not hear his side of the story even though he heard Narayanan’s.Advocate Amit Sharma, representing Mathews, also said that the committee should have heard him if any aspersion was cast on him in the report. But the bench replied that the purpose of the committee was not to adjudicate, but to make recommendations. It added that an accused was not supposed to be heard before the registration of a case, which was yet to happen. The bench, however, accepted Sharma’s request that the report should be kept confidential and be not be leaked to the press.On his part, solicitor general Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Union government, requested the bench to direct CBI to register a regular case (RC) straightaway in spite of first conducting a preliminary enquiry but the court said that CBI will have the freedom to choose its course of action.The case against Narayanan was filed by the state’s Congress government in 1994. The government handed over the probe to CBI, which cleared Narayanan of all charges and blamed some police officials and then Intelligence Bureau (IB) deputy director RB Shreekumar of implicating the space scientist. After a trial court accepted CBI’s closure report, the state government tried to revive the investigation but the apex court rebuffed this endeavour.In 2018, the SC also directed the state government to award Rs.50 lakh in compensation to Narayanan for his wrongful incarceration, malicious prosecution, and humiliation for being dragged in a false case. It had also observed that Narayanan deserved more, and that he could approach a lower court in Kerala for proper compensation. In August 2020, the Kerala government handed over an additional compensation of Rs.1.3 crore to Narayanan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cbito-probe-conspiracy-against-ex-isro-scientist-101618533627534.html

He, however, did not name the countries.Afghanistan is a nation which is rich in resources and there are nations which tend to exploit resources for their own benefit...If that happens, it should be prevented. The international community must step in to ensure that Afghanistan is for the Afghans," he said.There have been renewed global efforts to bring lasting peace to Afghanistan.Russia recently organised a conference in Moscow where all major stakeholders were invited to brainstorm over ways to move forward in the peace process.India has been a major stakeholder in the peace and stability of Afghanistan.It has already invested USD two billion in aid and reconstruction activities in the country.India has been supporting a national peace and reconciliation process which is Afghan-led, Afghan-owned and Afghan-controlled.Last month, Afghan foreign minister Mohammad Haneef Atmar visited India during which External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar conveyed to him New Delhi's long-term commitment towards a peaceful, sovereign and stable Afghanistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/troops-withdrawal-from-afghanistan-shouldn-t-create-vacuum-for-disruptors-in-afghanistan-bipin-rawat-101618533217752.html

Later, Abhimanyu’s father A Kumar claimed that he was not so active in politics but his elder brother was a regular worker of the party. Police said they had identified two assailants and they would be arrested soon.“It is fact all our family members are Communists. He may be an SFI activist at school but he was not at all active. My second son, he was about to write the SSLC examination. I have no idea why he was killed like this,” his father said.But CPI(M) Alappuzha district secretary R Nazar said he was an active worker of the SFI and RSS workers were behind the murder. “It was a clear political murder,” he said adding assailants came in search of his elder brother but when they failed to get him they took revenge on his brother.But both the RSS and BJP distanced themselves from the incident saying the CPI(M) was desperate to make all murders political killings to mask the murder of a Muslim League activist in Kannur on the polling day-- April 6. Three days after the Kannur murder, one of the accused in the case was found hanging and his autopsy report claimed that he was attacked before suicide.“Police officials and the father of the victim said politics was not involved in the incident. CPI(M) is desperate to make it a political murder to get some sympathy as the party was exposed in some of the recent political clashes,” said BJP district president A V Gopakumar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cpim-bjp-lock-horns-over-15-year-old-boy-s-murder-in-kerala-101618515134236.html

These 10 districts account for more than 51 per cent of the 13,784 active cases in the state.“The night curfew has been clamped to restrict the movement of people. There will be no restrictions on the vehicles carrying goods within the state and outside. No religious, social, cultural, academic and political gathering or procession will be allowed in Odisha, starting from Friday. The restrictions will be there till further orders,” said Mohapatra.While night curfew in the 10 districts close to Chhattisgarh would be between 6 pm and 5 am, for the rest of the state the timing is 9 pm- 5 am.The Odisha government also said inter-state bus operations would be suspended from April 19 while intra-state bus services will continue with limited capacity only. Only 2 passengers would be allowed in an auto and taxi while government offices will function with 50% staff.The Covid-19 surge in Odisha has been among the highest in eastern states this month. From 394 new cases on April 1 to 2989 cases now, infections have shot through the roof primarily due to R0 of 2.14, said epidemiologists. They said if the current surge continues, then by the mid-May, Odisha would see more than 10,000 cases daily.While the resurgence has been led by growth in districts like Sundargarh and Kalahandi, districts like Khurda and Cuttack are also fuelling the numbers. The holy town of Puri also witnessed a sudden spike registering 112 positive cases in a single day. Many servitors and their family members have tested positive for Covid-19..With Covid-19 cases exploding in Odisha, the state government on Thursday postponed the Class 10 and 12 board examinations while the Biju Patnaik University of Technology rescheduled the semester (regular/back) examinations for the academic session 2020-21.The Steel Authority of India Limited announced that its newly-opened Super Specialty Hospital at Rourkela with 60 ICU beds would be utilised as a Covid Care Hospital.

16-04-2021||India||Slugest as Oppn accuses Vijayan of protocol breach||Thiruvananthapuram: Amid the surging second wave of the coronavirus disease in Kerala, the opposition Congress and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Thursday sought action against chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan, claiming he flouted Covid-19 protocols and hid his illness so as to participate in a road show ahead of and voting during the assembly election on April 6, thereby endangering others. The chief minister tested positive for Covid-19 on April 8 and was admitted to the Government Medical College in Kozhikode the same day. He was discharged on Wednesday, six days after being hospitalised. When a controversy erupted over his early discharge, hospital authorities said he might have contracted the infection days before he got admitted. They added that when he was infected severely when admitted, but asymptomatic. According to Covid-19 protocol, patients have to be in quarantine for at least a week after testing negative -- usually two weeks in quarantine is prescribed. Hospital authorities said the CM would isolate in his home for a week. Union minister of state for external affairs V Muraleedharan said, “Hospital records show he was infected much earlier. On the polling day (April 6) his daughter Veena Vjayan, who was staying with him, came in a PPE suit to cast her vote. He should have gone on quarantine immediately. But on polling day, he came in a large group to the polling booth in Pinarayi village.” Muraleedharan asked the police to register a case against Vijayan. “Two days before the polling, the CM carried out a mega road show in his constituency.” “He gives big lessons to all on quarantine and post-quarantine norms. But it seems he is beyond these restrictions. He flouted all norms brazenly,” said Muraleedharan. The Kerala Youth Congress said it will petition Governor Arif Mohamad Khan against the CM. “If I would have violated Covid norms like this and stood in the long queue to exercise my franchise, my house would have been destroyed the same day,” Kerala Youth Congress leader Veena Nair, who is a candidate from Vattiyoorkavu, posted on social media. However, state health minister K K Shailaja said the whole controversy was unwarranted . She said the CM was discharged after testing negative, adding that he was in home quarantine for a week. “How can you say he was infected two days before the election? His daughter was infected on polling day (April 6) and got herself isolated in her house. There is no room for any controversy,” she said. But opposition parties said the minister was forced to defend the CM and some of her observations were “ill-founded”. As cases rise alarmingly in the state, the CM has convened a virtual meeting on Thursday to assess the situation.  Kerala logged 8,778 new Covid-19 cases and 22 related fatalities on Wednesday, taking the caseload to 1.18 million and the toll to 4,836, according to state government data. Among the districts, Ernakulam reported the highest number of 1,226 cases, followed by Kozhikode with 1,098 and Malappuram with 888.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/slugest-as-oppn-accuses-vijayan-of-protocol-breach-101618512971079.html
16-04-2021||India||80-90% decline in water birds’ count in last 2-3 decades in B’luru||Bengaluru Deteriorating ecology of lakes, the presence of untreated sewage, and concrete embankments that claim to help waterbody rejuvenation have led to a steady decline in the number of water birds found in Bengaluru, according to experts and environmentalists.Bird watchers and ornithologists say the decline could be anywhere between 80% to 90% over the last two to three decades. According to ornithologist and scientist S Subramanya, the use of civil engineering techniques for lake development has a profound impact on the water birds. “The lakes used to be shallow water basins with varying water depths and different birds would occupy different depths of water. Now, the lakes are usually desilted uniformly and only a small section of birds benefit from that,” he explained. For instance, deep water of uniform depth discourages waders, diverse populations of which migrate to India, including the southern peninsula in winter. Subramanya added that the lakes, which used to be seasonal have turned perennial due to the inflow of sewage water. “The structure and ecology of these lakes have changed and as a consequence, the water bird population has nosedived,” he added. Bird watchers who update lists of various species on online platforms also noticed higher presence of birds of a single species rather than diverse ones. According to a joint report by Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) and National Environmental Research Institute (NEERI), 19 of the 205 extant lakes (out of an earlier estimate of 250) in and around the city are completely encroached. And only 21 have water that’s fit to drink. A report by the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB) in 2020 suggested that not even one lake had water fit for drinking. Between 2008 and 2020, the BBMP claimed to have developed around 80 out of 205 lakes with another 20 under various stages of completion, but this development often refers to the building of concrete structures around the lake rather than any focus on the ecology itself. According to State of India’s Birds 2020 , a report on the distribution and conservation of birds, there has been a “gradual decline” in the population of birds in the metro cities of Bengaluru, Chennai, Delhi, Hyderabad, Kolkata and Mumbai.Birders and environmentalists also referred to “man-made problems” such as rapid and unplanned urbanisation that is replacing the habitats of these winged creatures. Moreover, conservation efforts by the government often refers to the legal protection of animals, they added. The most noticeable change in Bengaluru is the disappearance and an explosion in the number of pigeons and barn owls, experts said. “Pigeons are traditionally known to lay eggs based on the availability of food. But they breed all year now since there is feeding by humans that has altered the very nature of their reproductive structures and caused an explosion in their numbers,” Chandrakanth, formerly with the University of Agricultural Sciences (UAS) in Bengaluru, said.Pigeons now tend to nest in every possible concrete structure, including apartments and other buildings to avoid threats from other predators as well, experts said. Studies showed that their excreta is capable of causing multiple diseases and is extremely acidic that can cause long-term damage to structures and humans and spread salmonella germs .  Similarly, Barn Owls which were a rare species of bird in the city, also nest in apartment complexes as open garbage attracts rats which are easy prey for these nocturnal birds, experts added. The sight of walkers and joggers feeding birds with all kinds of food such as biscuits, grains, puffed rice and even bread is a common sight in areas such as Cubbon Park and Lal Bagh . The use of chemicals and pesticides has also impacted the health of these birds who feed on seeds and insects in these areas. The trouble in assessing the actual impact is the lack of proper studies to determine the rise in population of a few birds and disappearance of others, birders and ornithologists said.“Of the 261 species for which long-term trends could be determined (i.e. not uncertain or data deficient), 52% have declined since 2000. In all, 43% of species showed a long-term trend that was stable and 5% showed an increasing trend,” according to the report by CSIR and NEERI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/8090-decline-in-water-birds-count-in-last-2-3-decades-in-bluru-101618512911783.html

State capital Patna, the worst affected, with a cumulative death toll of 486 and case load of 66,913 out of Bihar’s 3.01 lakh cases and 1,675 deaths so far, breached all previous records, when it reported 2,105 cases, the highest in a day so far. Patna contributed to 10,068 active cases in Bihar’s 29,078 on Thursday. All 50 beds, which the AIIMS-Patna increased during the day, were filled up in a couple of hours. The AIIMS has now increased its bed capacity to 200, with the state government pushing it to scale it up to 250. Similarly, the 50 ICU beds, which were made operational at the Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (IGIMS), were also filled up in quick time. The Bihar government had earlier decided to convert its 750-bed Nalanda Medical College Hospital (NMCH) in Patna into a dedicated Covid-19 hospital. It was declared a Covid-19 dedicated hospital, along with AIIMS-Patna, last year too. “We have decided to convert the NMCH into a dedicated Covid-19 hospital,” said state health minister Mangal Pandey. He said the IGIMS would add another 100 beds for Covid-19 patients in the next three days. Pandey had also instructed the department’s principal secretary Pratyaya Amrit to ensure that there was no shortage of oxygen, amid reports of shortage of oxygen at some private nursing homes and clinics. Amrit held discussions with the industries department in this connection. Some private facilities like Sai Hospital and Satyabrat Hospital at Kankerbagh locality in Patna reported shortage of oxygen on Wednesday. According to people familiar with the development, the crisis had arisen as one of the three suppliers in Patna had shut its unit for two days due to maintenance.Patna district magistrate Chandrashekhar Singh, who held a meeting with oxygen suppliers and hospital representatives, had instructed suppliers to make available 90% of their supply to hospitals. He asked the three suppliers — Usha Air Products Ltd, Bypass Road Sipara; Patliputra Industrial Gases Private Limited, Sabalpur, Deedarganj; and Banshi Air Gas Private Ltd at Fatuha — to ensure regular supply of oxygen so that there was no scarcity. Singh also advised all hospitals and nursing homes not to hoard any oxygen cylinders and take them as per their daily requirement to ensure seamless supply as demand had peaked with a spike in Covid-19 cases in the last couple of days. He also deputed a magistrate at each of the three supply centres to monitor supply to hospitals and ensure there was no hoarding and black marketing. The district administration also sealed a private engineering coaching institute at Kankerbagh, which was functioning despite the government’s instructions to keep them closed and was also not conforming to Covid-19 norms. Around 200 students were crammed in two rooms when the raiding party visited the institute on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/new-high-for-covid-19-cases-in-bihar-as-state-adds-6-133-fresh-infections-101618512672340.html

Visakhapatnam commissioner of police Manish Kumar Sinha, who visited the spot, told reporters that the incident came to light when one of the residents noticed smoke billowing out of Naidu’s flat at around 4 am and informed the local fire station. “The fire staff, who rushed to the spot, found the apartment locked from inside. They broke open the lock only to find all the four members of the family burnt,” Sinha said. Residents informed P M Palem police station about the incident. “While a short circuit was initially suspected as the reason behind the deaths, as the air conditioner and other electric appliances in the room were also found burnt, police turned wary after they found blood stains in the room,” the police commissioner said.A senior police official probing the case said on condition of anonymity that the bodies of Naidu, Nirmala and Kashyap were found with severe stab injuries near the main door, hall and bed room, respectively. The body of Deepak, was found in the bathroom of one of the rooms. “No injuries were found on his (Deepak’s) body and he was clad in a suit and tie. The dog squad and forensic team of the city police have visited the crime scene and collected evidence,” the official said. “Prima facie, it appeared there was an argument between Deepak and other members of the family over some issue. This may have gotten out of hand . It appears that the elder son later tried to set the place ablaze and escape but in the process, he too was caught in the fire,” the official added. The official also said that neighbours told the police that they heard screams around 2 am. “The forensic team is collecting all evidence from the spot. The visuals obtained from closed circuit television (CCTV) cameras showed Naidu was the last one who entered the flat at around 8.56 pm on Wednesday night. After that, there is no information on what happened inside,” Sinha said. The police commissioner said the family, from Gantwada village of Vizianagaram district, lived in Bahrain for four years before returning to Visakhapatnam eight months ago. “The family was constructing a new house nearby and had taken the flat on rent ,” Sinha said. During the course of the probe, police learnt that Naidu worked with a firm in Bahrain for about two decades. His wife Nirmala was a homeopathic doctor. “Deepak completed his engineering from National Institute of Techonology (NIT), Warangal, and was believed to be preparing for Civil Services Examination.The younger son was a student of Class 12,” Sinha said. “The family has no relatives and acquaintances in the area, so we couldn’t gather much information on Naidu. More details will be available after a thorough probe,” he added. A case has been registered under Sections 302 (murder) and 201 (hiding of evidence) of the Indian Penal Code.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/family-of-four-found-dead-in-vizag-flat-101618512672872.html

Darbar Move deferred because of Covid. Secretariat to function in both #Srinagar & #Jammu. Office functioning not to be affected because of eOffice,” Sinha tweeted on Thursday.Jammu & Kashmir recorded 1,141 fresh Covid-19 cases on Thursday, taking the infection count to 142,877, while four more deaths raised the toll to 2,046. The practice of Darbar Move, under which the administration functions for six months from Jammu and six months from Srinagar, was started by Maharaja Gulab Singh in 1872 to escape the extreme weather conditions in the two regions.Since Jammu & Kashmir is witnessing a surge in the number of Covid-19 cases, the threat it poses to people and the staff on the move, it has been decided to defer the Darbar Move this time, the lieutenant governor said.“However, Secretariat will function in both Srinagar & Jammu with staff equitably split between two Secretaries will function from both locations in an equitable manner,” he said.He said the government’s functioning will not be affected as files will move electronically between the secretariats using the e-Office software.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jk-l-g-defers-darbar-move-secretariat-to-run-from-both-jammu-srinagar-101618512551832.html
16-04-2021||India||Set up control rooms for smooth oxygen supply, states told||New Delhi The Centre on Thursday directed states to set up control rooms to ensure smooth supply of medical oxygen to districts, and to review requirement of cylinders and tankers on a regular basis, with reports coming in of shortages in various parts of the country. In a meeting later on Thursday, the government decided to import 50,000 metric tonne of medical oxygen as a matter of precaution. The decision was taken at a high-level meeting of the empowered group 2 (EG2) that looks after the availability of essential medical equipment including medical oxygen. The officials also decided to map 12 high disease burden states to oxygen sources so that these states don’t face any shortage.Government data showed about 50% of the country’s supplies were available.“There has been increasing demand for medical oxygen, especially from the 12 states with high burden of active COVID cases… To give clarity and assurance to the states on oxygen supplied over the next few weeks of surge in cases, a mapping exercise was undertaken… as per the directions of EG2. Sources of medical oxygen and their production capacity was mapped to match the requirement of states and an indicative framework has been developed to guide the states on the sources of medical oxygen,” said Union health ministry in a statement. The high burden states are Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, Chhattisgarh, Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan. While the demand in Maharashtra expected to go beyond available production capacity of the state, states like Madhya Pradesh do not have any production capacity to meet demand for medical oxygen. Besides, there is a trend of increasing demand in other oxygen producing states such as Gujarat, Karnataka, Rajasthan, according to the health ministry. Accordingly, the health ministry has indicated 4,880 metric tonne, 5,619 metric tonne and 6,593 metric tonne to these 12 states for meeting their projected demand as on April 20, April 25, and April 30, respectively.“There is no shortage of medical oxygen in the country; in fact, there is more than what we currently need, and the supplies are being further ramped up as a measure of abundant precaution,” said a senior government official aware of the matter, who did not wish to be identified. On Wednesday, the medical oxygen consumption in the country was 3,842 metric tons, which is about 54% of the daily production capacity.The health ministry reiterated in a statement that there is sufficient production capacity of around 7,127 MT for oxygen in the country, and as per need, the surplus oxygen available with the steel plants is also being utilized. On Thursday, Reliance Industries’ Mukesh Ambani started supplying oxygen from the company’s refinery in Jamnagar to Mumbai, which is among the biggest hotspots of Covid-19 in the country. The problem may not be in the cities as much as it is outside them, said one expert. “In cities, oxygen shortage is not usually a problem; it is the smaller towns that may face a supply crunch if hospitalizations increase in a big way. Oxygen therapy is critical in saving lives, and it is not just about giving oxygen but also how it is given that makes a huge difference in treatment outcome. The need is to keep the wastage minimal,” said a senior critical care specialist, in a prominent government-run hospital, who asked not to be named....||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/set-up-control-rooms-for-smooth-oxygen-supply-states-told-101618512431640.html

All social, religious, political, or weddings of over 200 people were barred and all cinema halls, restaurants, bars and gyms were asked to operate at 50 % capacity. All educational coaching institutes and swimming pools will be closed, said the government.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageThe order came hours after the state reported its highest one-day spike of Covid infections, posting 2,220 cases.But the order said in case of the Mahakumbh – which is ongoing in Haridwar --- the standard operating procedure (SOP) issued by Centre in January and the state government in February will remain in effect. The standard operating procedure does not place any restrictions on the gathering of people and only seeks social distancing and Covid negative test report to enter the Kumbh area.Activists said the decision was inexplicable. “It is a strange decision at a time when the state has reported the highest daily spike...exempting Mahakumbh area from these restrictions will make it difficult to check Covid in the state in particular and in India in general. Just on Wednesday, Haridwar witnessed pilgrim rush of over 1.3 million people at a time when we are witnessing a sharp surge in Covid cases,” said Anoop Nautiyal, from Social Development for Communities Foundation, a non-governmental organisation.Hundreds of thousands of people have violated the government’s Covid-19 guidelines since the Mahakumbh began on April 1. On the third “shahi snan” on Wednesday, 1.35 million devotees took a dip in the Ganga,. In the previous “shahi snan” (royal bath) on April 12, 3.1million people participated.Security personnel handed out challans to some people in the crowd over violations of the Covid-19 norms, but visuals showed that a majority of seers gathered to bathe in the Ganga were in violation of Covid-appropriate behaviour.After the capital Dehradun (37,743 cases), Haridwar is the worst-hit district in the state with 19575 infections. On Thursday, Haridwar posted 613 cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/night-curfew-in-u-khand-but-not-at-kumbh-mela-101618512430986.html
16-04-2021||India||Gujarat is facing tsunami of cases: HC pulls up state govt||AhmedabadThe Gujarat high court on Thursday pulled up the state government for alleged discrepancies in the number of coronavirus disease cases and said that the state is facing a “Tsunami” of infections.The court was hearing a suo moto petition into the state’s response to the pandemic. “The figures given by the state are not matching with the actual number of positive cases,” a division bench led by Chief Justice Vikram Nath said. Gujarat on Thursday reported 8,152 fresh infections and 81 new fatalities, taking the state’s tally to 375,768 cases and 5,089 deaths. “We told you to get ready with more COVID-designated hospitals; sufficient beds should be available; testing should be increased; make sure people wear masks; and (maintain) strict vigilance at public places,” the bench said.“But, it seems that the state government did not give due consideration to our suggestions. That is why we are seeing a Tsunami of corona at present,” the bench said.In his response, Advocate General Kamal Trivedi assured the court that the state government was “serious” and doing everything possible to fight the pandemic.The bench also raised doubts over the Bharatiya Janata Party government’s claims about the availability of beds, testing facilities, medical oxygen and Remdesivir injections.“Doctors are administering it (Remdesivir) indiscriminately,” Trivedi claimed, adding that the situation would improve after the Centre, banned the export of the drug at the request of the Gujarat government.An unimpressed bench, also comprising Justice Bhargav D Karia, asked, “Do you mean to say that the hype behind Remdisivir is being created by doctors? Do you have an idea of what is the requirement of Remdevisir?” According to the national treatment protocol, Remdesvir is one of the investigational drugs approved for use in treating hospitalized Covid-19 patients. With the rising cases, the demand for the drug has also shot up. To be sure, most studies have shown the drug has no real effect and it has been removed from the treatment protocol in many countries. According to a status report filed by Trivedi, 71,021 beds are available in over 1,000 facilities across the state and Covid-19 patients occupy only 53% of beds as on April 12.Questioning these numbers, the bench said, “We have serious doubts about this figure. You are saying only 53% are occupied. Yet patients are not being admitted. In that case, how can this figure be true?” The high court also appeared unconvinced about the government’s claim that it is doing its best to meet the demand of medical oxygen. “Hospitals are not admitting patients who require oxygen. We have learned that oxygen is being black-marketed. Hospitals are misusing their quota. Oxygen is being siphoned off after getting approval for beds while patients are turned away claiming that it is not available,” the bench said.(With PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gujarat-is-facing-tsunami-of-cases-hc-pulls-up-state-govt-101618512371023.html
16-04-2021||India||EC bars Bengal BJP chief for 24 hours for ‘inciteful remarks’||The Election Commission of India (ECI) on Thursday banned Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)’s West Bengal chief Dilip Ghosh from campaigning in the state for 24 hours for his “highly provocative and inciteful remarks” on the Sitalkuchi firing incident, in which four people were killed as polling was underway last week. A day after violence broke out during fourth phase of polling in Cooch Behar district on April 10, Ghosh had said at a rally in Baranagar in North 24 Parganas that “there will be Sitalkuchi in several places”. Four people were killed in firing by Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) personnel in Sitalkuchi. While the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) alleged the firing was unprovoked, the poll watchdog and central forces said it was in “self-defence” as the security personnel at the polling booth were under attack by a mob. On Sunday, the TMC filed a complaint against Ghosh for his statement, prompting the ECI to seek his response. “The commission sternly warns Dilip Ghosh and advises him to desist from using such statement while making public utterances during the period when Model Code of Conduct is in force and imposes a ban of 24 hours...,” the ECI order said, adding that the “highly provocative and inciteful remarks” can “adversely impact law and order thereby adversely affecting the election process”.The ban for violating the Model Code of Conduct is applicable from 7pm Thursday till 7pm Friday, April 16, the order stated. Ghosh, when asked about the ban, said on Thursday he will take the time off campaigning to rest. “The ECI ordered whatever it thought was right. I will stay at home and take rest. I was not getting proper sleep and time to have a proper meal because of the campaigning,” he said. The TMC, however, said that Ghosh should have been banned for at least 72 hours. “Today (Thursday) was a holiday. He will eat sweets. He should have been banned for 72 hours,” said chief minister Mamata Banerjee in an interview to ABP Ananda on Thursday evening.Ghosh isn’t the only leader to have been banned from campaigning by the poll panel as the state began voting in eight phases on March 27. On Monday, Banerjee too was barred from campaigning for 24 hours by the ECI for allegedly appealing to Muslim voters to unite and urging local women to surround central forces if they create disturbances. The TMC called the decision unfair and Banerjee protested in Kolkata on Tuesday.BJP leader Rahul Sinha had been banned earlier this week from canvassing for the party after he said “not just four, but eight people should have been killed by central forces in Sitalkuchi”. TMC defector and Banerjee’s rival in Nandigram constituency Suvendu Adhikari was, too, warned by the ECI to desist from making communally charged statements. Forty-five constituencies will vote in the fifth phase of polling in Bengal on April 17. Voting will end on April 29, and results counted on May 2.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ec-bars-bengal-bjp-chief-for-24-hours-for-inciteful-remarks-101618512251016.html
16-04-2021||India||Railways adds more special trains as Covid-19 curbs return||The Indian Railways is adding special trains to cater to the rush of migrant workers heading back to their home states from the big cities, taking current operations to nearly 70% of pre-Covid levels, as the country’s mass transport lifeline seeks to avoid a rerun of last summer’s situation where thousands of people were forced to walk hundreds of miles in the absence of rail services.Over the past week, the railways planned 69 additional “summer special trains” to cater to the rush being reported across stations. By April 30, the national transporter has planned 133 additional trains with 88 “summer special”’ and 45 “festival special” trains.According to railway ministry data till Wednesday, the national carrier has approved a total of 9,622 special trains and is currently running an average of 7,745 trains as against 11,283 during pre-Covid times. Of these, a total of 5,387 suburban trains are currently deployed, nearly 92% of pre-Covid capacity, with the most services operating in the central railway zone that caters to Maharashtra’s highly populated cities, including Mumbai and Pune.“We have told zones to add special trains wherever the demand is coming. We are ready to deploy more trains. This is regular summer rush that the railways witnesses. As per the demand we are adding these summer special trains,” a senior ministry official said.According to the railways, these additional trains are for high-demand destinations such as Gorakhpur, Patna, Darbhanga, Varanasi, Guwahati, Barauni, Prayagraj, Bokaro, Ranchi and Lucknow.Amid lockdown curbs being announced by states with heavy migrant populations, such as Maharashtra, several cities have reported an unusual rush of people across interstate bus stations and railway stations though the railway ministry has maintained that this is the regular summer festival rush.On May 1 last year, the Centre began operating Shramik Special trains to ferry hundreds of thousands of stranded migrants back to their home states. The national carrier last year deployed a total of 4,621 special trains and carried 6.31 million migrant workers. The trains ferried the highest number of migrants back to Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, the country’s most populous states, followed by Jharkhand, Odisha and West Bengal.Last week railway board chairman Suneet Sharma clarified there were no plans to curtail passenger trains services. He added that the railways will continue to run trains as per the demand amid reports of migrant labourers rushing to stations due to fears of another hard lockdown.“There is no plan to curtail or stop train services. We will run as many services as required. There is no cause for alarm…Wherever there is a surge in demand we will increase trains. There is no shortage of trains for those who want to travel. I assure everyone that trains will be provided on demand wherever the need arises,” Sharma said at a press conference.The railways last year in March suspended regular train services during the nationwide lockdown to curb the spread of Covid while regular freight train movement continued. At present, it is running special passenger trains while regular operations have still not resumed. The ministry is restoring passenger train operations in a phased manner. It has planned more trains during April-May to clear the rush.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rlys-adds-more-migrant-trains-as-curbs-return-101618512131589.html
16-04-2021||India||Conduct remaining phases of polls in one go: Mamata to EC||Kolkata With West Bengal registering an alarming spike in the daily count of Covid-19 cases, chief minister Mamata Banerjee urged the Election Commission of India on Thursday to hold the remaining phases of the state assembly elections in one go. On Friday, the state’s chief electoral officer will meet representatives of all the 10 recognised political parties in the state to ensure that Covid-19 protocols are followed during election campaigns. “Amid an ongoing pandemic, we firmly opposed ‪@ECISVEEP’s decision to conduct WB polls in 8 phases. Now, in view of the huge surge in #COVID19 cases, I urge the ECI to consider holding the remaining phases in ONE go. This will protect the people from further exposure to #COVID19,” Banerjee tweeted on Thursday evening. On Wednesday, the Calcutta high court ordered the state’s chief election officer and all district magistrates to ensure strict implementation of coronavirus-related protocols in political campaigns for the remaining four phases of polling. “Four phases have been completed while the fifth phase is scheduled on Saturday. The ECI can hold the remaining three phases in one go. After the fifth phase ends around 114 seats will remain. They can give us (political parties) some time for campaigning and conduct the polls in one phase around April 26,” Banerjee said in an interview to a vernacular media channel on Thursday evening. A senior official of the poll panel has said that there are no plans at present to hold the remaining phases in one go. West Bengal reported 6,769 new cases on Thursday, which was more than 31 times the daily count on February 26, when the ECI had announced the poll dates. This is also the highest daily count of Covid-19 the state has registered since the disease broke out in 2020. “The election is being conducted by the ECI. Every political party has to have deep faith in the poll panel’s ability and neutrality,” said Jay Prakash Majumdar, vice-president of the BJP’s state unit. While a Congress candidate from Murshidabad district, who was Covid-positive, died on Thursday, at least five other candidates of various political parties have been diagnosed with the virus. “If the ECI decides to postpone or conduct the election (remaining phases) before the scheduled dates the Congress has no objection. The Congress party and the Sanjukta Morcha don’t play with the life of the common people,” Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, president of the Congress party in West Bengal, told the media in Murshidabad. The TMC chief slammed the BJP and held it responsible for the spike in Covid cases, alleging that the party is bringing in hundreds of men from outside the state for election campaigns. “They (BJP) are bringing in hundreds of men from outside. All their top leaders, including the Prime Minister, Union home minister, other central ministers and chief ministers of all BJP-ruled states are coming every day and holding rallies. Can we test each and every one of them?” said Banerjee. Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath tested positive for Covid-19 and is isolating himself, he tweeted on Wednesday. He held three rallies in south Bengal on April 8. “The ECI should complete the poll process at the earliest. The more it lingers, the higher would be the spike. We need to focus on Covid-19 at the moment. Else the situation would aggravate further. Mass gatherings where people hardly follow the safety protocols act as superspreaders. The HC order is welcome and should be strictly implemented. All safety protocols have taken a back seat in the elections rallies as a result of which, the cases are rising,” said Manas Gumta, general secretary of Association of Health Service Doctors in the state. While the BJP earlier on Thursday alleged that the same group of miscreants who shot an 18-year-old first-time voter at Sitalkuchi in Cooch Behar on April 10 attacked central forces in a planned manner, Banerjee said later the entire sequence of events in which four people were shot dead by central forces was planned by a BJP MP along with central agencies. Meanwhile, an FIR was lodged against Banerjee in Cooch Behar alleging that she instigated voters to gherao central forces which led to the firing incident in which four persons were killed. Banerjee had earlier been banned for 24 hours from canvassing for allegedly making statements against central forces.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/conduct-remaining-phases-of-polls-in-one-go-mamata-to-ec-101618512130981.html
16-04-2021||India||Centre simplifies re-issue process for OCI cardholders||The Centre said on Thursday that the Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) cardholders will now be required to get their document re-issued only once at the age of 20 instead of multiple times needed currently.According to a Press Information Bureau statement, a person who has got registration as OCI cardholder prior to attaining the age of 20 years will have to get the card re-issued only once when a new passport is issued after his or her completing 20 years of age, so as to capture his or her facial features on attaining adulthood.If a person has obtained registration as OCI cardholder after attaining the age of 20 years, there will be no requirement of re-issue of OCI card, it said.Currently, the OCI card is required to be re-issued each time a new passport is issued up to 20 years of age and once after completing 50 years of age, in view of biological changes in the face of the applicant. “With a view to facilitate the OCI cardholders, the government has decided to dispense with this requirement,” it added.The decision, officials familiar with the matter said, has been taken on the directions of Union home minister Amit Shah as part of the government’s desire to simplify the process and it is expected to significantly ease the process for re-issue of OCI cards.The OCI card has proved to be very popular among foreigners of Indian origin and spouses of foreign origin of Indian citizens or OCI cardholders, as it helps them in hassle-free entry and unlimited stay in India. So far about 37.72 lakh OCI cards have been issued by the government of India, the statement said.According to the extant law, a foreigner of Indian origin or a foreign spouse of an Indian citizen or foreign spouse of an OCI cardholder, can be registered as an OCI cardholder. The OCI card is a life-long visa for entry into and stay in India with a number of other major benefits attached to it which are not available to other foreigners.The PIB said, “With a view to update the data regarding new passports obtained by the OCI cardholder, it has been decided that he or she shall upload a copy of the new passport containing his or her photo and also a latest photo on the online OCI portal, each time a new passport is issued up to 20 years of age and once after completing 50 years of age. These documents may be uploaded by the OCI cardholder within three months of receipt of the new passport.”However, the spouses of the cardholders will have to upload the copy of their passport along with a declaration that their marriage is still subsisting each time a new passport is issued.The Centre said there will be no restriction on the cardholder to travel to or from India during the period from the date of issue of new passport till the date of final acknowledgement of documents in the web-based system.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-simplifies-re-issue-process-for-oci-cardholders-101618511770949.html
16-04-2021||India||India to process Covid vaccine import license in 3 working days post approval||India’s drug controller will process import licenses and registration certificate applications of foreign-made Covid-19 vaccines in three working days after granting the emergency-use approval, according to the Union health ministry’s regulatory pathways announced on Thursday.The government on Tuesday said Covid-19 vaccines cleared for use in the US, the UK, the European Union, and Japan will get fast-track approval in India. The move is expected to potentially boost India’s pandemic response when it has recorded the world’s biggest surge in infections.“Applications for restricted use in emergency situation for such vaccines maybe accompanied by bridging trial protocol, application for import registration certificate and application for import license. Central Drugs Standards Control Organisation (CDSCO) will process applications for registration certificate (registration of overseas manufacturing site and product) and import license, within 3 working days from the date of approval of restricted use in emergency situation,” said Union health ministry in a statement.An application can be made by a foreign manufacturer through its Indian subsidiary. It can also be filed through an authorised agent in India in case a company does not have an Indian subsidiary.“The drugs controller general of India (DCGI) will issue permission for restricted use in emergency situation with, inter-alia, the following conditions: vaccine shall be used as per the guidelines prescribed under National Covid-19 Vaccination Programme. First 100 beneficiaries of such vaccines shall be assessed for 7 days for safety outcomes before it is rolled out for further Vaccination program. Applicant shall initiate conduct of post approval bridging clinical trials within 30 days of such approval,” the Centre’s guidelines said.Foreign-made Covid-19 vaccines were also Tuesday granted exemption from conducting local bridging studies prior to seeking emergency use authorisation provided they have approval from any of the major regulators globally or the World Health Organisation (WHO).Companies have been given the flexibility to perform the bridging studies parallel to administering of the shots to the general population.The Centre has said each vaccine batch will be released by the Central Drugs Laboratory (CDL), Kasauli, before it can be used as per the guidelines prescribed under the National Covid-19 Vaccination Programme.After receiving approval from the CDL, an applicant will use the Covid-19 vaccine only on 100 beneficiaries initially and submit the safety data to the CDSCO. The company concerned will be allowed to use the vaccine only after the safety data of 100 beneficiaries submitted by it is reviewed by the subject experts in CDSCO and found to be satisfactory.The regulator will approve the protocol for the bridging trial in consultation with its subject expert panel within seven days of the receipt of the proposal.The government hopes that this decision will facilitate quicker access to foreign vaccines by India and encourage imports including that of bulk drug material, optimal utilization of domestic fill and finish capacity etc, which will, in turn, provide a flip to vaccine manufacturing capacity and total vaccine availability within the country.Dr V K Paul, member (health), Niti Aayog, said there is no compromise on the quality of data. “It has to be robust. India is known to approve quality drugs and vaccines globally, and export in large volumes, and there is no question of diluting that. The regulatory mechanism has been modified to save time in special situations like this pandemic,” he saidCompanies will conduct the bridging trial within the timelines specified under the approved protocol and submit the data. After the receipt of the bridging trial results, the ’ controller will review the permission granted for restricted use in an emergency situation.Also Read | WHO asks researchers to use Covid-19 lessons to battle deadly superbugs“Only the condition of a prior bridging trial has been done away with, and that has been allowed to run in parallel,” said Paul.Paul on Tuesday said they hope to invite vaccine makers such as Pfizer, Moderna, and J&J.The accelerated approval will apply to doses authorised by the US Food and Drug Administration, UK’s Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, European Medicines Agency, Pharmaceuticals, and Medical Devices Agency Japan, or by the World Health Organization.There are vaccines by three companies that are approved by regulators identified by the government and are yet to be authorised in India: Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and J&J. A fourth vaccine, made by Novavax, has made progress in clinical trials and sought approval from several of these regulators.Among these, two companies already have tied up with Indian companies for production — Novavax and J&J. Novavax has licensed Serum Institute of India to produce a billion doses and the Pune-based company is also carrying out bridging trials in the country. Similarly, Hyderabad’s Biological E has a deal to produce 600 million doses of the J&J vaccine and was recently poised to begin bridging studies.The Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines were among the first to be approved anywhere in the world last year. Both have an efficacy rate of over 95% and use mRNA technology, which has emerged as a breakthrough platform for coronavirus vaccines.India is the world’s biggest maker of vaccines. It has so far doses of Covishield and Covaxin, the first two shots to be approved in the country. A third, Sputnik V made by Russia’s Gamaleya Institute, was approved formally on Tuesday, and doses are expected to be imported at first before a group of five Indian companies that have contracts to begin churning out doses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-to-process-covid-vaccine-import-license-in-3-working-days-post-approval-101618489929093.html
16-04-2021||Today's||The Taste with Vir: The politician as super-spreader||The economist Joan Robinson is supposed to have said that for every statement about India, the exact opposite is also true.I was reminded of her words as I watched the latest wave of the Covid pandemic cut a swathe through India. In our cities and our towns, grim-faced ministers announced ‘curfews’ (the word ‘lockdown’ is to be avoided, apparently, after the fiasco last year) while poor migrant workers thronged railway platforms looking for trains that would take them back to their villages. Small businesses prepared to go bust. Hawkers starved. Hospitals struggled to keep up with the flood of new cases while crematoria said they were full; anyone with a funeral to conduct would have to wait in line for at least a few hours.And yet, just two hours from Mussoorie where I am writing this, lakhs of pilgrims thronged the banks of the Ganga to celebrate the Kumbh Mela. There were no masks. There was no social distancing. The pilgrims were assured by politicians and others who should know better that they were in no danger because they had divine protection.Alas, no such protection was forthcoming. Each day, hundreds tested positive. God knows how many Covid cases there really were because only a small proportion of the pilgrims were actually tested. As the symptoms took hold, the condition of those afflicted turned worse and the death toll began to rise.The contrast between the imposition of curfews and the insistence on strict social distancing all over India and the super-spreader nature of the Kumbh could not have been greater or more glaring.But all calls to cancel the Mela had been rejected and even as the Covid cases mounted, state officials maintained, with increasing levels of desperation and mendacity, that the Kumbh was not a threat to public safety.Even as people were dying in Haridwar, another tamasha was taking place in another part of India. For reasons nobody can fully explain, the Election Commission planned an extraordinarily long campaign for the assembly election in West Bengal. It is true that Bengal is a large state with its own set of specific problems but it did seem odd that the Election Commission managed a poll for 234 seats in Tamilnadu in one day. But Bengal with its 294 seats took over a month.It was hard to dispel the suspicion that the Commission wanted there to be lots of time available for the BJP’s central leadership to go from region to region to campaign against the TMC, which is a local Bengal party.Well, the Commission got its wish. For over a month now, politicians have been organising massive super-spreader rallies in Bengal. There are huge crowds. There is no social distancing. And even the leaders who address these rallies and mix with local workers don’t worry unduly about masks or distancing. There is not much testing in the villages of Bengal so it is hard to tell what the accurate Covid figures are, but there is little doubt that infections are going up.How can a country with the second largest number of Covid cases in the world (or the largest number if you believe those who say that India is under-reporting its cases), occupy two separate realities? There is the India where people die or are thrown out of work, where the health structure is collapsing. And there is the India where lakhs of pilgrims cheerfully bless each other with the virus; the India where politicians urge people to gather together so the infection can spread.For every statement about India: the opposite is also true.Yes we are imposing strict anti Covid measures. And yes we are also encouraging the spread of the virus.We all know what the real reason for these bizarre alternate realities is.Politics. The BJP is the party of Hindutva. It fears a dent in its loyal support base if it interferes with religious festivals. Far better to let the Kumbh turn into a super-spreader festival than to risk upsetting its supporters. And the West Bengal election is crucial to the BJP. Opinion polls suggest that it has, for the first time, an opportunity to form the government in West Bengal, a huge breakthrough for a party that, only a decade or so ago, was not such a significant player in the state.Is it going to throw away that opportunity only because of a little spiked ball of death called the Corona virus? Once you recognise what the government’s priorities are, then it becomes clear why India is losing the battle against Covid.It seems probable now that the sudden surge in Covid cases is due to a more easily transmissible virus variant. This is not unprecedented. The virus mutates all the time and new variants have been discovered all over the world. In the UK, for instance, when the Kent variant was discovered, the government locked the country down and ordered vaccinations on an emergency footing. Britain is now opening up again, its numbers largely under control.In India, there has been no conclusive word yet from the Centre about any more transmissible variant. Meanwhile the UK is studying what it thinks might be a new Indian variant. And though state health authorities suggest that this might in fact be the case, the Centre continues to act as though the surge is our own fault. Why didn’t we wear our masks properly? We caused the surge ourselves.Variant? What variant?Because everybody at the top of the political structure was too busy with elections, the fight against Covid was left to second-raters and middle-level morons. It suited the politicians to pose as heroes who would send vaccines to the world. Clearly nobody in the medical establishment told them that we did not really have enough vaccines to supply the world. Now, we are reduced to importing vaccines.The UK vaccinated its people at super-speed once it knew that a dangerous new variant was around. We stuck to our own pre-arranged pace. This was passed off as a thought-out strategy when actually we had no other choice. We did not have the vaccine doses required to open vaccination to those at risk in hot-spots. When vaccines began to run out, then like all second-raters who find that the situation is slipping out of their control, the minister and his henchmen began playing politics and blaming state governments.Now that the situation is desperate, the Prime Minister has finally over-ruled the smug buffoons who have been handling our Covid response. More vaccines will be approved. The vaccine programme will be stepped up.No doubt in time, these will be lauded by pliant media as master-strokes. By then, people will have died or suffered terribly. All because politicians were too busy fighting elections to care about our health. Here’s one generalisation about India that I don’t think even Joan Robinson can dispute. Every time there is a crisis, you can count on politicians to slip up and let the people down.And no, the opposite is never true.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/the-taste-with-vir-sanghvi-the-politician-as-coronavirus-superspreader-101618576307363.html
16-04-2021||Today's||The Great Indian Kitchen raises the right questions||The unannounced guest is someone we’ve all met. “The women can rest today,” he says grandly. The men are taking over the kitchen.After dinner, you can see from the way her shoulders sag that the kitchen is an apocalyptic mess: Dirty utensils, splattered curry, onion peels, and, from afar, a voice demanding two cups of black tea.Much has been written about Jeo Baby’s The Great Indian Kitchen, streaming on Amazon Prime. At an online function, Supreme Court judge DY Chandrachud referred to it. Others see it as a comment on socially-imposed gender roles, patriarchy in religion and society, a remark on the Sabarimala judgment, and the stifling of female aspiration.Its truth prevails across the globe. Leisure is a male pursuit while the women chop, clean, sweep, fry, wash, simmer, serve. Worse is the justification of this drudgery as “auspicious” work, because what can be more important than running a house and raising children? Also Read |The Great Indian Kitchen movie review: A powerful film on patriarchyThere is no country where housework, or to use its more accurate term, unpaid care work, is equally shared. But the gap in India is particularly wide with women spending around six hours a day; men 52 minutes. No surprise then that unpaid care work is the “main barrier to women’s participation in the labour force,” finds the International Labour Organisation.With so much to be done (unpaid) at home, women in India continue to leave the paid labour force in droves. It’s a situation made worse by the pandemic where the labour of housework has shot up with families at home, leading to a disproportionate job loss among women.In the latest round of assembly elections, some parties promised salaries for housework, leading to a welcome debate on putting a value to domestic work.Should housework be paid for? If so, what’s a fair compensation? Who will pay? Would it lead to a greater sense of entitlement by men or would it lead to more opting for paid housework?Housework certainly needs an image makeover, stripped of all the humbug of noble work and shorn off its gender stereotyping. Media must play a role in normalising the man in the kitchen, not as a super-hero but as a regular guy putting dinner on the table every day.Also Read | Study finds disproportionate ‘gender bias’ behind Facebook’s job adsThe courts have insisted on equal compensation to housewives killed in motor accidents, implying that their lives are of equal monetary value, even if they do not bring an actual salary home. This attitude of an equal partnership should inform other legal matters including divorce and maintenance. The noisy salary debate does little to hide the zero policy measures to ensure a reduction in the gender gap in housework. There is silence by government around the crisis in female workforce participation. We do not have a pandemic recovery plan tailored to the needs of women who have been hit harder than men.The Great Indian Kitchen raises the questions. The answers are yet to come.Namita Bhandare writes on genderThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/the-great-indian-kitchen-raises-the-right-questions-101618565534811.html
16-04-2021||Editorials||Delhi’s Afghan dilemma||For India, the paradox of the unfolding situation in Afghanistan is stark — and geopolitically painful. Few countries are as deeply affected by developments in Afghanistan as India. There is geographical proximity; there is the ideological outlook of the Taliban and its close association with Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI); there is the history of Afghanistan having been used to stir up instability in India, with groups and radical Islamists on both sides of the Durand Line responsible for terror attacks on Indian soil, especially in Kashmir through the 1990s. And there is the experience of having seen what an unfriendly regime in Kabul can do — most visibly, in 1999, when IC-814 was hijacked and then flown to Kandahar, under sympathetic ISI-Taliban gaze, forcing India to give up terrorists who continue to engage in terror and destruction two decades later.Yet, India’s ability to influence developments in Afghanistan is exceptionally limited — especially since the United States (US) decided it was time to go home and, a tad too enthusiastically, gave a resurgent Taliban a seat at the negotiating table. With President Joe Biden declaring that troops will come back home by September 11 — two decades since the attack which led to the war in Afghanistan — the Taliban just has to wait it out and will exercise power in Kabul, much to the glee of its handlers in Rawalpindi.India recognises the new reality, and has a seat on the table. But it is acutely conscious, as Chief of Defence Staff Bipin Rawat said at the Raisina Dialogue, that US withdrawal could lead to a vacuum, filled by disruptors. The disruptors, the Taliban internally and Pakistan externally, will become decisive players in Kabul — with a fair degree of backing from China and Russia, as the US retreats even more and the current Afghan government struggles to retain its legitimacy and power. India can sound the warning bells, but has to deal with reality as it exists. To begin with, this will require narrowing down its interests to a core principle — there must be no security threat to Indian interests if the Taliban comes to power. But conveying this message only to external interlocutors won’t suffice. Delhi now needs to formally talk to the Taliban, and leverage its equity in Afghanistan — influence with the elite and popularity with the people — to drive home the message that the Afghanistan of 2020s must not be the Afghanistan of 1990s.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/delhis-afghan-dilemma-101618578075736.html
