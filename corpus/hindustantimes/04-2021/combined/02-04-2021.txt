Is it for real?||West Bengal 2021 is as thrilling as it gets as far as elections in India go… There are big stars, action, drama and emotions thrown into this political pot-boiler that has all of us on the edge of our seats every minute.In the latest, speculation is flying thick and fast that Mamata may well contest against PM Modi from Varanasi in 2024.The buzz ties up beautifully with perceptions of Mamata Banerjee’s national ambitions. There is no doubt that if Mamata Banerjee wins this high octane election - and if she wins comfortably - she could emerge as the most powerful leader in the Opposition camp that has mostly been rudderless over the last several years.For now, the Mamata vs Modi face-off in Varanasi is just a social media virtual thought and not an on-ground reality. But what if….HOW THE VARANASI CHATTER BEGANA seemingly humble, retaliatory Twitter post by the Trinamool Congress on Thursday night set the cat among the pigeons. The post, which was uploaded late Thursday night from Trinamool’s official handle, was a comeback to PM Modi’s claim at a rally in Bengal that there were rumours that Mamata Banerjee may contest from another seat in the last phase.“Is there any truth in the rumour that you (Mamata) are going to file your nomination from another constituency? First, you went to Nandigram and people gave you an answer. Go somewhere else and the people of Bengal will give you the right answer," PM Modi said on Thursday while campaigning in South 24 Paraganas.The TMC delivered its counter on Twitter: “Didi is winning Nandigram. The question of her fighting from another seat doesn't arise.” The tweet also cautioned PM Modi to “look for a safer seat in 2024, as you (Modi) will be challenged in Varanasi.”The cryptic reference to Varanasi came not just from Trinamool’s official Twitter handle but also echoed by another firebrand TMC MP Mahua Moitra. In a tweet, she categorically asked the PM to don his “armour” as Mamata Banerjee will run from Varanasi in the 2024 Lok Sabha polls.Varanasi has been PM Modi's constituency since 2014 when he first came to power at the Centre following the BJP's landslide victory in the national elections.MAMATA’S NATIONAL AMBITIONSNow just five days ago – and smack in the middle of a do-or-die assembly election - the Bengal chief minister wrote a letter to at least a dozen opposition leaders – Sonia Gandhi, Sharad Pawar, MK Stalin, Akhilesh Yadav, Uddhav Thackeray, Hemant Soren, Arvind Kejriwal - calling for a united and effective struggle against the BJP.In the letter, she made a clarion call to all opposition parties to come together and offer a credible alternative to what she dubbed was BJP’s “one-party authoritarian rule” in India. The Trinamool supremo had suggested that a meeting of all leaders be held to chart out a plan of action after these assembly elections.Several opposition leaders have accused the BJP of aspiring to rule all the states. No doubt that a democracy is defined not only by the government, but also by the dynamism of its Opposition. And by all accounts, India’s opposition has never been as weak as it is today. So if India seems to be veering towards a one-party rule, many analysts have argued the opposition is also to be blamed.Mamata Banerjee’s letter is seen as significant in this context. Several political analysts in Bengal and outside have interpreted the letter to signal that Mamata Banerjee wants to focus on national politics once the assembly polls are over.And if Mamata wins Bengal in 2021 – many opinion polls did make this prediction before the election process was formally kickstarted – she might just acquire the necessary heft among opposition parties to become the face of the anti-BJP front that she has outlined in her letter.Mamata Banerjee did play a key role in trying to forge an anti-BJP coalition of parties ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections too. She had organised a massive rally in Kolkata’s Brigade Parade Ground in January 2019 attended by almost all leaders of regional parties opposed to the BJP.But that initiative fell flat owing to differences between various parties over seat-sharing.THE 2024 POLL BUGLEWest Bengal 2021, and the chatter about Mamata contesting against Prime Minister Modi from Varanasi, has certainly blown the poll bugle for 2024.When Arvind Kejriwal picked up the cudgels in Varanasi in 2014, many dubbed it the proverbial David vs Goliath battle. PM Modi had won Varanasi by a massive margin of 3.37 lakh votes.If Mamata Banerjee goes up against the PM in 2024 – the ‘Khela’ in Varanasi will be worth a seat in the front row with popcorn to match.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/mamata-banerjee-versus-pm-modi-in-varanasi-is-the-buzz-is-it-for-real-101617361419285.html

Mahesh and Mohit were out on bail since last September and November, respectively, after being arrested following a shoot-out with the Rohini district police team in September 2019. They did not sustain any injury in that incident. Police said they received a tip-off on Thursday about the duo passing through Rohini on their way to Rohtak, following which a trap was laid on Helipad Road in Rohini’s Sector 37.An officer said the two suspects were spotted on a motorcycle around 3am. While the duo took a U-turn and allegedly tried to escape, their bike skid and they fell on the road during the police chase.According to police, the duo allegedly pulled out their guns and began firing at the police. Police said the two men fired five rounds at the police -- three of which hit the bulletproof vests of two policemen. “We fired three rounds at them,” said DCP Yadav. While Mahesh was shot near his right knee, Mohit sustained a wound near his left knee.Police arrested the two and alleged seized two guns and five bullets from their possession.Police said overall, Mahesh has been involved in 70 cases while Mohit’s name has cropped up in 25 cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/2-criminals-arrested-after-brief-exchange-of-fire-in-rohini-101617388144680.html
02-04-2021||Other||AAP, BJP spar over proposed excise policy||New Delhi The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Friday criticised the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) for protesting against the Delhi government’s proposed excise policy for the national capital and accused it of corruption, a charge which was denied by the latter as “baseless”. The BJP further hit back saying the AAP is engaging in corruption through the proposed policy.The proposed excise policy for Delhi aims at increasing the government’s revenue, improving consumer experience, contributing to ease of doing business, and cracking down on import of liquor from other states which cause revenue loss to the Delhi government. The policy proposes to reduce legal drinking age in Delhi from 25 to 21 years, bring down the number of dry days and ensure equitable distribution of liquor stores across the city. Delhi BJP leaders have been protesting against the proposed policy since Tuesday.“In Delhi, a lot of people aged below 25 years go to restaurants and pubs and consume liquor. For that, the BJP leaders extort money from restaurant and pub owners. With the new policy, this extortion will stop. Also, several BJP-ruled states such as Goa, Karnataka and Himachal Pradesh have 18 years as the legal drinking age. Why do they have a problem with the Delhi government reducing it to 21?” said AAP MLA Atishi in a press conference at the party office in central Delhi on Friday.Delhi BJP, however, termed the allegations “baseless”. “They should stop misleading people on the issue and answer questions such as why is the Delhi government adding liquor shops? Why are they handing over 500 shops to private enterprises? Why are they (government) preferring a system with fewer number of wholesale distributors? This policy reeks of corruption,” said Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor.While AAP is in charge of the Delhi government, the BJP rules all three municipal corporations. Restaurants and pubs in the city have to adhere to guidelines, regulations, and protocols under the jurisdiction of both administrations, depending on the nature of the issue – like food safety standards, taxes, excise, fire safety, pollution, etc.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/aap-bjp-spar-over-proposed-excise-policy-101617387844727.html
02-04-2021||Other||5 hitmen, part of Lawrence Bishnoi gang, arrested in north Delhi||New Delhi Delhi Police on Friday arrested five hitmen, who are allegedly part of an interstate syndicate led by jailed gangster Lawrence Bishnoi and his key confidant Sandeep alias Kala Jatheri, from near north Delhi and recovered four pistols, a revolver and 70 cartridges from their possession.Bishnoi is lodged in Ajmer jail while Jatheri, who fled from Haryana Police’s custody following a gunfight last year and carries a ₹7 lakh reward on his arrest, is controlling the gang’s operations in Delhi, Haryana, Rajasthan, Punjab and Uttarakhand, police said. “The arrested men are ‘guns-for-hire’ (hired shooters) and were wanted for a series of gruesome crimes including a triple- and a double-murder at two places in Haryana last year. They were acting as a bridge between Bishnoi-Jatheri and another wanted gangster from Gurugram, Sube Gurjar, who also carries ₹7 lakh reward on his arrest,” said deputy commissioner of police (counter intelligence wing of special cell) Manishi Chandra. DCP Chandra said that the five were caught early Friday morning from near Chandgi Ram Akhara in north Delhi, following multiple operations that his teams had been conducting in five cities in four states – Haryana, Punjab, Rajasthan, Uttarakhand – using its “Trace-Track-Monitor” capabilities. Police identified the five as Kapil Nehra (23), Yashpal alias Sarpanch (28), Rajeev alias Raju Basai (25), Rahul Mehalawat (23), and Gagandeep alias Guni (35). While Nehra and Gagandeep hail from Haryana’s Rohtak and Punjab’s Barnala respectively, the rest are from Gurugram. “They all have been found involved in more than a dozen cases of murder, attempt to murder, contract killing, extortion and shootouts with police in Delhi and the four states,” said Chandra. About the operation against the syndicate, DCP Chandra said that after escaping from Haryana police custody in February last year, Jatheri had been working to expand his network in Delhi and its adjoining states. As some most wanted criminals were arrested in the last one year, many criminals from the neighbouring states, including Bishnoi and Jatheri, have been trying to fill the void of Delhi’s crime world, the officer said. “While Bishnoi himself is in jail, he roped in Jatheri to expand the syndicate’s footprints in Delhi. Jatheri is closely assisted by one Kala Rana, who is from Bishnoi’s gang and is suspected to be hiding in a southeast Asian country. This gang has committed several firing and extortion incidents in Delhi-NCR in the last eight-nine months,” said an officer, who did not want to be named. Even as the arrested men are being questioned regarding their visit to the capital, on account of the recovery of arms and ammunition, Delhi Police officers suspect that they were planning “something big”.According to police, on August 20, the arrested men and their associates had allegedly killed three rival gang members in Gurugram. In a case of mistaken identity in February this year, they had allegedly killed two men in Rohtak. They had also committed contract killings on the directions of Bishnoi and his Canada-based aide Goldy Brar, said the DCP. Police said that at least half a dozen similar firings for extortion were reported from other areas in southwest Delhi last year. In most of the cases, the attackers threw “threat slips” with the names of their gangs, police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/5-hitmen-part-of-lawrence-bishnoi-gang-arrested-in-north-delhi-101617387844113.html
02-04-2021||Delhi||Body of a woman found in Mangolpuri, while a man is found killed in Narela in two separate cases||Two persons, including a 26-year-old woman, were found murdered in outer Delhi’s Mangolpuri and Narela between Thursday and Friday. Police said the two murders are not connected, but in both cases, the prime suspects were known to the victims and are currently on the run. In the woman’s murder, the prime suspect is her live-in partner, the police said. In the other case, the brother-in-law of the 36-year-old dead man is the suspect, police said, adding that the motive in both the cases is unclear.According to police, at 10.52am on Friday, the police received a call regarding the discovery of a woman’s body in her rented room, on the fourth floor of a building in Mangolpuri. A team reached there and found that the woman’s two children –aged 6 and 4 – were sitting next to the body. There were injury marks on the woman’s head and the right side of the face. She was identified as Jyoti alias Soni, said deputy commissioner of police (outer) Parvinder Singh.Through local inquiry, the DCP said the police learnt that Jyoti had shifted to the rented room a few days ago with her live-in partner Shiva Sharma, a carpenter. She was separated from her husband, the police said.“Prime facie, it seems that the woman had a fight with Sharma on Wednesday night and he hit her on the face and head. She suffered injuries and started bleeding and Sharma fled, after locking the main door leading to the staircase,” said DCP Singh. In the morning, the children were calling out to people from the fourth floor window, asking for help. That was when the body was discovered, the DCP said.“Efforts are on to nab Sharma,” he added.Nearly 24 hours before the woman’s body was found, the body of a 36-year-old man, with the face burnt, was found at a vacant DSIIDC flat in north Delhi’s Bhorgarh near Narela, the police said. Police identified the deceased as Karan Kumar from Kanjhawala and a murder case has been registered. Police are conducting searches to arrest the man’s brother-in-law, Panna Ram.Deputy commissioner of police (outer north) Rajiv Ranjan Singh said Kumar’s relatives discovered his body at the vacant second floor flat on Thursday morning and informed the police. Kumar was missing since March 31 and a complaint in this regard was already lodged with the police.“There were injury marks on the man’s neck and hands; his face was burnt, probably to mask his identity. However, relatives who were present at the spot identified the body as that of Karan Kumar,” the DCP said.In his statement, Kumar’s nephew Vicky told the police that his uncle left home around 11am on March 31, purportedly to meet Panna Ram. But when Kumar did not return home, the family met Panna Ram, who claimed that Kumar had not met him.However, Panna Ram had an injury in his leg and he asked Kumar’s family members to search for him at the DSIIDC flats. “Panna Ram became the prime suspect after Kumar’s body was found in one of the flats and he has been on the run since then,” said a police officer, asking not to be named.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/body-of-a-woman-found-in-mangolpuri-while-a-man-is-found-killed-in-narela-in-two-separate-cases-101617387786948.html

His interrogation has revealed that he has abused and blackmailed at least six other women so far. In one of those cases, a minor girl had approached the cyber cell of Faridabad Police last year to allege that Khatar had morphed her photos, uploaded them online and was blackmailing her. He was later arrested in that case also,” said Atul Kumar Thakur, deputy commissioner of police (south). The precise details of his past involvements in such cases are being looked into, Thakur said, adding that two mobile phones allegedly belonging to Khatar have been sent for forensic examination.The present complaint against Khatar was made by the13-year-old’s mother at Kotla Mubarakpur police station last month after she got to know that her daughter was being blackmailed.During the probe, police got to know that the whole incident started after the girl’s 15-year-old friend came in contact with Khatar online. “They got chatting and later exchanged numbers. However, Khatar later allegedly started trying to have obscene chats with her. This led to a heated exchange between them,” said the DCP.Later, when the 13-year-old girl got to know of this, she got in touch with Khatar and warned him against it.“Khatar then wanted revenge against the 13-year-old for having confronted him. So, he created three fake social media profiles, morphed her photographs, and uploaded them on those accounts. When the girl got to know of this and demanded that the accounts be deleted, he demanded sexual favours from her in return. The girl then went and told her mother everything, after which she approached the police with a complaint,” the DCP said.After receiving the complaint last month, investigators tracked down the IP address from which the fake accounts were created. That led them to Khatar who was arrested from his home in NIT Faridabad on Thursday, the DCP said.The officer said that Khatar would habitually create fake accounts on social media and use them to contact girls and women. He would then allegedly start morphing their images and blackmailing them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/man-arrested-for-creating-fake-profiles-blackmailing-minor-for-sexual-favours-101617387784593.html

The two children were allegedly administered bathroom disinfectant and their mouths were gagged with cloth pieces.No suicide note was recovered from the house, but investigators believe that the woman first allegedly tried to poison her children before hanging herself.Police said both the children had been rushed to a private hospital for treatment and the condition of the younger child was serious while that of the elder one was stable. The incident came to light after the constable made two calls to the police control room around 8pm that his wife had failed to respond to repeated knocks, said deputy commissioner of police (southwest) Ingit Pratap Singh.The couple married in 2014 and lived in a two-bedroom flat. The constable had gone to his native village in Rajasthan and returned to Delhi on Thursday evening only to find the door locked from inside. When his wife did not respond to repeated knocks or his calls, he panicked and called the police, said a neighbour.“Nobody in our neighbourhood was aware of the matter until they saw a police van reach the area and saw some policemen rushing to the constable’s flat. I followed them. They broke open the door and found the constable’s wife hanging from a ceiling fan. Their two children were found unconscious in the bathroom with pieces of cloth stuffed in their mouths. All of them were rushed to a nearby hospital, where the woman was declared brought dead,” said the neighbour.DCP Singh that the woman’s family has been informed about the incident. “The statements of her family members are being recorded before the local sub-divisional magistrate. Legal action will be taken in case a complaint is made on the basis of their statements,” he said.In a similar incident reported on Thursday morning from Rohini, a contractual DTC bus driver had also died by suicide with the bodies of his wife and their two sons — aged 6 and 3 — found lying in the same room with stab wounds.

The revelations came following the arrest of Giri in an attempt to murder case registered on March 28, said Khanna senior superintendent of police (Khanna) Gursharandeep Singh Grewal.The case was lodged against Giri, his two sons and their accomplices following a complaint by one Nikhil Sharma of Khanna. An FIR under Sections 307, 323, 324, 148, 149, 506 and 120-B of the Indian Penal Code, and Sections 25, 54 and 59 of the Arms Act is registered against them in this regard.During questioning, the SSP said, Giri confessed that he had orchestrated the attack on himself to get more security. For this, his son, Rajan, had hired two men, Jaswinder Singh of Lakhpur village, Banga, and Gurinder Singh of Mukandpur village, Nawanshahr, to carry out the fake murder attempt.On March 9, 2020, the two men arrived on a motorcycle and opened fire outside Giri’s house, following which he called the police.“Giri had claimed that while walking to a nearby temple, he had noticed the shooters making rounds of his colony, due to which he had walked back home and bolted the gate from inside. The accused had fired twice and one bullet had hit the main gate of the house,” said the SSP, adding that the accused were captured in the CCTV cameras while escaping.“They had a foolproof plan to make the attack appear real, which helped Giri get more security cover, while earlier he had only one gunman,” the police official added.The police are investigating where the accused procured the gun and have launched a manhunt for Bawa and the two shooters.In a similar case in March 2020, chairman of the labour wing of Shiv Sena (Hindustan), Narinder Bhardwaj, was arrested for concocting a story of assault on him. According to police, the 45-year-old was also eyeing more security cover.Shooters were arrested in another case, got bailNotably, the Samrala police had arrested Jaswinder and Gurinder, along with their two accomplices, for possessing illegal weapons on July 28, 2020. They were sent to jail on judicial remand and were later granted bail.

A manhunt has been launched following a complaint by Rajwinder Kaur, 67, the mother of the accused – Amarjit Singh and Narinder Singh.Rajwinder told the police that she lived with her husband, Harbhajan Singh, and grandson, Sarbjit Singh, 17, at their house in Vishwakarma Colony.She said two of her three sons, Amarjit and Narinder, had been staking claim to this property, besides others owned by her husband. On Thursday, Amarjit and Narinder, with their respective sons, a relative and three more men, barged into their house and assaulted her husband. They ransacked the house and stole ₹1.5 lakh in cash, their house’s legal papers and other financial documents. They then forcibly dragged her husband out of the house and left with him. Rajwinder said they had already divided their 14-acre land in Bijnor, Uttar Pradesh, among their three sons, while their only daughter had died. Besides their house in Moti Nagar, they own another building in Ludhiana, whose rent is their primary source of income.The woman added that Amarjit and Narinder wanted to grab all their properties and money and had therefore kidnapped her husband to force him to give in.Rajwinder claimed that her sons had assaulted her husband in December 19, 2020, as well.

02-04-2021||Ranchi||Jharkhand to prepare Tribal Development Index||A Tribal Development Index (TDI) will soon be prepared in Jharkhand on the lines of United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)’s human development index (HDI) to understand the current condition of tribal people and find out the areas of improvement.The TDI will be prepared by the Tribal Research Institute (TRI), a tribal research wing of Jharkhand government, in association with Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Roorkee.The project, to be funded by the union tribal affairs ministry and state welfare department, has already been allotted to IIT, Roorkee, to carry out the study. The project, estimated at ₹14 lakh, is likely to complete by year end.Chintu Doraiburu, who handed over the charge of TRI deputy director on Thursday after his transfer to personnel department, has been instrumental in drafting the project.“The TDI will be a prototype of HDI. It will concentrate on tribal population. Objective of the project is to understand how government schemes have benefited the tribal to uplift their lifestyles and livelihood. The research work will also look into the areas where improvement is required,” he said. Doraiburu said, “IIT Roorkee will carry out random sampling covering all tribes of Jharkhand. All indicators prescribed under UNDP’s HDI such as population trends, health outcomes, education achievements, income, livelihood and human security will be covered in the study. The institution is expected to submit its outcome report by December.”He said the project was to start last year but got delayed due to Covid-19 pandemic and lockdown.Jharkhand has 32 tribal groups, of which eight tribes — Asur, Birhor,Birjia, Korwa, Mal Paharia, Pahariya, Sauria Paharia and Savar— are from Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Group (PVTG). Tribal people form 26.2% of the state population.According to the Census 2011, population of PVTGs in Jharkhand has increased from 2,23,336 in 2001 to 2,92, 359, around 30.9%.Former Tribal Advisory Council (TAC), Jharkhand, member Ratan Tirkey said, “If done in a right manner, the TDI would immensely help to understand current situation of tribal people in Jharkhand.”He said conditions of many tribes, particularly PVTGs, are still not good. Most of them still live in hills or forests without basic minimum facilities, he added.“I do not know on which parameters the study would be based. But, I would suggest the researchers to study the circumstances under which many tribes are leaving their past tradition and culture,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/jharkhand-to-prepare-tribal-development-index-101617383943797.html
02-04-2021||Ranchi||45% people have antibodies, 55% vulnerable in Jharkhand: Sero survey||A sero survey conducted in Jharkhand’s 10 districts has revealed that 45% of the over three crore population in the state has already been infected with Sars-Cov-2 virus that causes Covid-19 and developed antibodies.The sero survey phase 2 reflected that the remaining 55% population was vulnerable to the disease and at the risk of contracting the contagion.An interpretation of the survey report also highlighted that there was a possibility of antibodies weaning off with time (sero reversion).Jharkhand had conducted the sero survey (in-vitro qualitative detection of antibodies to SARS-COV-2) between February 4-26 in 10 districts namely Bokaro, Dhanbad, Dumka, East Singhbhum, Garhwa, Hazaribag, Khunti, Palamu, Ranchi and West Singhbhum.According to a health department’s press communique issued on Wednesday, as many as 3,965 samples were collected from community and high-risk group. Of the samples collected, 1,774 were found positive for Sars-Cov-2 antibody. This accounts for 44.74% spread.Among 1,774 samples found positive, 833 came from community and 941 were reported from high-risk group.According to the survey report, seropositivity was highest in Bokaro from where 425 samples were collected, out of which 245 were found positive for SARS-COV-2 antibody.In Ranchi, 241 samples out of 464 returned positive for SARS-COV-2 antibody.Considering Jharkhand’s 3.26 crore population, the size of the samples was small. However, experts say that if samples were collected scientifically, the present size is sufficient for the prediction.“Under the serosurvey, the samples were collected scientifically from both sectors, including from community and high risk zone. So, around 4,000 samples were enough for making the prediction,” said Dr Dewesh Kumar, assistant professor of department of preventive and social medicine at Ranchi’s Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences (RIMS).The survey among other things recommends to escalate Covid-19 vaccination coverage in the state at the earliest to achieve faster rate of population immunity. Besides, it focuses on continuation of the Covid-19 appropriate behaviour without complacency.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/45-people-have-antibodies-55-vulnerable-in-jharkhand-sero-survey-101617383764417.html

State rural development director Aditya Ranjan said, “The Centre had increased the minimum wage for the labourers under the scheme from ₹194 to ₹198 in March this year.”Chief minister (CM) Hemant Soren had requested the central government to escalate the wage from ₹198. “After getting no positive response from the Centre, the CM decided to increase the wage to ₹225. The gap between the Centre’s wage and state’s decided wage will be filled from the state exchequer,” stated a press communiqué issued by the information and public relation department of Jharkhand on Friday. In a bid to raise the workers’ income, the state would also request the Centre to revise the CFT (cubic feet) provision per man-day for labourers working under MGNREGS, a rural development official said.A worker’s man-day under the Centre’s scheme is considered after he digs 73 CFT soil in Jharkhand. In other words, a worker gets the minimum wage of ₹194 after he digs 73 CFT soil in Jharkhand. MGNREGS labourers in Andhra Pradesh get the minimum wage after digging just 28 CFT. In Chhattisgarh, it is 48 CFT, officials said.However, a time-motion study is begin carried out in Jharkhand by the National Institute of Rural Development and Panchayati Raj (NIRDPR) for revision in the CFT rule. Jharkhand has already achieved man days target of 8 crore this year. The state had requested the Centre to revise it. The Centre has set new target of 9 crore man days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/jharkhand-mgnregs-workers-to-get-225-minimum-wage-from-april-1-101617383703817.html
02-04-2021||Other||Proposed flyover bends to stay off historic Khuda Bhakhsh library||The proposed flyover between Kargil Chowk and Patna Science College on the contested stretch of Ashok Rajpath is set to undergo a design modification to save the heritage building of the famous Khuda Bakhsh Oriental Public Library (KBOPL). KBOPL, which has in its possession over 22,000 manuscripts, 3 lakh books and over 2000 rare paintings dating back to 14th Century, had objected to the road construction department’s (RCD) plan to build the flyover on Ashok Rajpath as the proposed construction required demolishing a portion of its spacious reading hall, named after the erstwhile Viceroy to India George Curzon to mark his visit to the library in 1905. In its bid to streamline traffic flow on Ashok Rajpath between Gandhi Maidan to the existing National Institute of Technology (NIT), Patna, which houses important institutions like Patna Medical College and Hospital (PMCH), Science College, Patna University and Patna College, chief minister Nitish Kumar had asked the RCD to build a flyover. Accordingly, the RCD had proposed a 2.20km-long four-lane flyover in double deck from Kargil Chowk to Science College, to be built at a cost of ₹369 crore, and sought permission to acquire a portion of land of the institutions near the roadside for the new project. While the PMCH has given its no-objection to offer land to the RCD, Patna University and Urdu Library are yet to give their consent. KBOPL director Shayesta Bedar, citing resolution of the board’s meeting, said essential elegance of the library and its hoary past would be obliterated if any portion of its land taken over for road construction. “We preserved the library’s reading room, which was more than a century old, even as a modern three-story building of the KBOPL was opened by President Ram Nath Kovind in 2017,” said Bedar. KBOPL has been frequented by research scholars from across the world ever since it was opened for public in 1891 by Khuda Bakhsh, the first vice chairman of Patna Municipal Corporation and bibliophile. Acknowledging the immense historical and intellectual value of its rich and valued collection, the Government of India declared the KBOPL an Institution of National Importance by an act of Parliament in 1969. The library, an autonomous institution, is fully funded by the Ministry of Culture. Bedar said they studied the new road proposal once the Bihar Rajya Pul Nirman Nigam Limited (BRPNNL) served notice on the library to give up its land and subsequently sent their objections to the district magistrate and later to the chief minister with valid reasons. BRPNNL had sent notices to all the institutions concerned a couple of months ago. “We hope CM Nitish Kumar, who had great sense and knowledge for history and archaeology, would understand out issues,” she said. Additional chief secretary, RCD, Amrit Lal Meena, said he had instructed the BRPNNL to modify the design of double decker elevated road so that quintessential of the KBOPL would not be disturbed in any way.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/proposed-flyover-bends-to-stay-off-historic-khuda-bhakhsh-library-101617383463765.html
02-04-2021||Other||Halted by Covid, kidney transplants pick up in Bihar again||Kidney transplants are gradually gathering momentum after a gap of six months due to the pandemic even as doctors are guarded given the second wave of coronavirus, with the state reporting over 2,000 cases and 13 deaths over the last eight days — the highest single-day spike in cases being 488 on April 1. The state reported 12 kidney transplants in the last six months at the four facilities approved by the health department — Ruban Memorial Hospital, Paras HMRI Hospital, IGIMS and BIG Apollo hospital — all in Patna.Doctors had put on hold all such procedures given the high probability of infection among patients on immunosuppressive drugs, after the Centre announced a nationwide lockdown on March 23 last year. The Ruban Memorial Hospital in Patna, accredited to the National Accreditation Board of Hospital (NABH), did the last such procedure on two patients on March 20. The two male patients, a 34-year-old from Hajipur and a 19-year- old from Patna, were discharged from the hospital on Thursday. “These were our first post-Covid-19 renal transplants since the previous one done at our hospital in 2019,” said Dr Satyajit Kumar Singh, managing director and senior urologist of the Ruban hospital. Most of the post-Covid-19 renal transplants in the state have been done during the last two months. The Paras HMRI Hospital, also accredited to the NABH, had done three, while the Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (IGIMS), an autonomous institution funded by the state government, and the Ruban Hospital had done two each. The Paras HMRI hospital, however, was the first facility in the state to do a renal transplant post Covid-19, in last October. “After our last pre-Covid-19 renal transplant in February 2020, we had temporarily stopped doing the procedure at our centre till last September. We gradually began again, having done one renal transplant in October, two each in November and December last year and three in February this year,” said Dr Syed Asif Rahman, medical superintendent, Paras-HMRI hospital. The IGIMS did its first post-Covid-19 kidney transplant in February and then in March, said Dr Om Kumar, professor and head, department of nephrology. “The first post-Covid-19 renal transplant at IGIMS was done in February on a 24-year-old male from Patna’s Baktiyarpur block and the second in March on a 25-year-old male from Munger. Both are doing fine,” he said. “We have planned another kidney transplant on April 6, but we will wait and watch the trend of Covid-19 infections in the state because we do not want to put the patient and their kidney donors at risk if the coronavirus infection increases in the state,” Dr Kumar said. Dr Pankaj Hans, head, department of nephrology, Ruban Memorial Hospital, and an associate professor at the Patna Medical College Hospital, said putting on hold renal transplants was not the solution in the present scenario. “We are much better prepared to tackle the pandemic now and have also gained in experience. Kidney transplant is a better mode of therapy in comparison to dialysis, as the patient’s quality of life improves. We should not deprive those who have donors and are willing to undertake the procedure,” said Dr Hans. He, however, cautioned, that doctors need to be guarded. “The new strain of Covid-19 virus may have higher transmissibility but is less severe in terms of mortality rate. We will adopt a cautious approach in doing kidney transplants. We need to be careful with patients taking immunosuppressive drugs and regulate their medicines because they are prone to contracting Covid-19 infection,” he said. The Ruban Memorial Hospital, which was the first in the state to do a successful kidney transplant in 2008, has done 14 such procedures so far. “The state government told us to wait till it framed its own rules, governing organ tissue transplant. We then lost three to four years because of change in ownership of our hospital and the government rules on the mandatory three-year cooling off period,” said managing director Dr Singh. In terms of kidney transplant, the IGIMS leads in the state, having done 73 procedures so far since it initiated it in 2016. The Paras-HMRI hospital had done 38 after introducing the facility in January 2018. The BIG Apollo hospital hasn’t done any kidney transplant procedure. “We got the government approval to perform kidney transplants only last month. We have the requisite infrastructure in place,” said its nephrologist Dr Harsh Vardhan. Quoting statistics, Dr Hans said 1.50 lakh patients required kidney transplant but only 7,500 transplants, on an average, were being done in India every year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/halted-by-covid-kidney-transplants-pick-up-in-bihar-again-101617383403807.html
02-04-2021||Patna||Taxing times for staff at Bihar varsities, colleges as I-T trashes their PF scheme||Several university teachers in Bihar are in a fix after receiving notice from the income tax department regarding identification of “high value information, which does not appear to be in line with their income tax returns filed for assessment year 2020-21 (relating to financial year 2019-20)”. The teachers have been asked to revise their ITRs and submit online response on compliance portal. The teachers say the “high value information” is their provident fund (PF) deposit, which the universities in Bihar deposit in the savings bank account as an old practice, and not in the general provident fund (GPF) account. So far, they availed tax relief on the basis of the income and deduction certificate issued by the college principals concerned. However, the I-T department has refused to accept this system and served notices to individual teachers. This could affect all the teachers and employees working in the universities and colleges of the state, as the same practice has been followed everywhere for decades. Last year also, the I-T department had refused to recognise PF deductions presently being made for teachers and disallowed any claim of relief u/s 80C of the IT Act, 1960. It also disallowed any claim made by the employees u/s 10 of the I-T Act on the interest received from such prevalent PF schemes in the state universities. As the teachers usually fix their PF amounts with banks to get higher interest, though it is still lower than the GPF interest, the I-T department treats these fixed deposits taxable income. The Universal Account Number (UAN) also eludes the college/university teachers and employees, as they are out of the PF net. “Any failure on the part of the drawing and disbursing officers to make deductions of income tax at source at the rate applicable on the income chargeable to salary will lead to recovery from the deductor along with monthly interest,” said an earlier letter from assistant commissioner (I-T, Patna circle) TT Bhutia. The I-T department has stuck to its stand again this year. Former chief commissioner, I-T, Vijay Sharma, who had sought information from the universities under the Right to Information Act, said there seemed to be a nexus involving all the stakeholders behind the practice adopted in state’s universities. “The PF commissioner should also have taken cognizance of it, as the I-T department is correct in not treating general savings account or fixed deposits out of the purview of PF to avail benefits under relief u/s 80C of the IT Act,” he said. He said the IT department would recognise the deductions for relief only if the amount goes to the GPF, which is regulated by the state government. Prof Parvez Ahmad of Patliputra University in Patna said the teachers and employees were the ultimate losers. “Instead of minuscule interest on savings account, they could get higher returns in GPF and the government and the universities must act on it,” he said. KB Sinha , working president of Federation of University Teachers’ Associations of Bihar (FUTAB), said he had written to the assistant commissioner of income tax earlier, saying there was nothing wrong with the PF deductions in colleges and universities, as the accounts were with the nationalized banks as per provisions of university Acts and statutes and were hitherto treated equivalent to government PF accounts.“All PF accounts, whether in government or private and autonomous institutions, have controlling officers, Similarly in universities and colleges, registrar/principals are the custodians of PF accounts . No deposit or withdrawal can be made without their consent,” wrote FUTAB working president KB Sinha and general secretary Sanjay Kumar, urging the I-T department to withdraw the letter. However, I-T department has refused to oblige. The delay in PF deduction of school teachers appointed in the state since 2006 had also landed in the Patna High Court. After the Patna High Court order and letter from the additional central provident fund commissioner (Bihar and Jharkhand) Rajib Bhattacharya to the department of education, the government finally decided to extend EPF coverage to its nearly four lakh teachers last year, though the teachers have still moved the court with a petition seeking that the benefit be extended from their date of joining, not the date when the government brought them under PF coverage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/taxing-times-for-staff-at-bihar-varsities-colleges-as-i-t-trashes-their-pfscheme-101617383283766.html

Old enmity is stated to be the reason behind the attack. Police said all four accused had been arrested. Reports said the youth sustained injuries in his private parts but circle officer (CO), Nighasan, Pradeep Kumar Verma, who is investigating the case, said, “Such injuries are mentioned neither in the complaint nor in the statement of the victim.” “Even the attending doctors were not informed about such injuries by the victim or his relatives,” he said. However, he added that investigation was underway and all the four accused had been arrested. According to Tikonia police sources, Dharmendra, the victim’s brother, told the police in his complaint that Harendra was preparing for a competition and practised running early morning. According to his complaint, Harendra was running outside his house on Wednesday when the accused Bramhadeen and his three sons Bharat, Gajraj and Raju caught hold of him and took him to their house where they brutally beat him. The assailants left him seriously injured. Later, his family members rescued him and rushed him to the local primary health centre. However, in view of his serious condition, Harendra was sent to the district hospital where he is still under treatment. CO Pradeep Kumar Verma said an FIR under Sections 323, 504, 506, 342 and 308 of IPC and Sections 3(27) 5A of SC/ST Act had been registered against the four accused who had been arrested.

02-04-2021||Pune||PMC won’t budge on decision to not pickup waste from bulk generators||In the background of next year’s civic elections, political parties have raised strong objection on the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC)’s decision to not pick up garbage from bulk waste generators.After the objection, the PMC has decided to only impose a fine and give some more time to make arrangements to bulk waste generators. For the past year, the PMC has been creating awareness and warning bulk generators including big residential societies, government, and private establishments to make arrangements to process their own wet waste. In December 2020, the PMC solid waste department set a deadline of March 31, 2021for bulk generators to make arrangements or set up a system to process garbage within their premises. As per the data of the solid waste management department, there are a total of 1,403 bulk waste generators. The number of residential societies is more in comparison to the commercial establishments. However, the PMC has not initiated strict action on bulk waste generators after the Congress, NCP and Shiv Sena’s objections. The MVA parties warned PMC that if the civic body stops picking up wet waste, garbage will be dumped at the doorstep of BJP office bearers. Aba Bagul, Congress party leader said, “It is the duty of the administration to pick up, transport and dispose of garbage. It cannot be denied. We will conduct an agitation against the administration and BJP office bearers.” Prithiviraj Sutar, Sena leader said, “In the solid waste management department’s policy, there is no such provision or action mentioned to stop picking up garbage. The PMC is not able to process or run garbage processing plants in the city. Now, they are pressurizing societies to set processing plants. Most of the societies don’t have enough space; the PMC should give more time and find a solution to this kind of problem because setting up a plant was not mandatory to societies before 2002. We are against this decision,” he added. Ganesh Bidkar, BJP leader of house in PMC said, “The PMC has not started any action on societies till date. We will discuss with the administration on this decision.” Kunal Khemnar, PMC’s additional municipal commissioner said, “Due to the Covid-19 situation, we have decided to impose a fine on bulk waste generators and give more time to make arrangements of processing garbage.” He further said, “We have sorted only 3,000 establishments. It is not for the entire city. It is a very small chunk compared to the city population. We are following policy and government directives which were passed by local representatives. Another thing, we are ready to cooperate with societies to sort out their problems but, they should have to approach us. The bulk generators should appoint a private agency to process wet garbage. The PMC is ready to pick up dry garbage, but the PMC will not pick up garbage from bulk generators after March 31, 2021 and impose a fine as per law. However, we are concentrating on the commercial establishments.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pmc-won-t-budge-on-decision-to-not-pickup-waste-from-bulk-generators-101617378003585.html

A letter from the director-general of National Mission for Clean Ganga, Rajeev Ranjan Mishra, was handed to Swami Shivanand Saraswati by Ganga Vichar Manch national convener Bharat Pathak at Matri Sadan ashram. Soon after reading the letter, the seer broke his three-week-long agitation. “NMCG has already written to the Environment, Forest and Climate Change Ministry to review its decision on environmental and technical grounds to stop illegal quarrying from Raiwala till Bhogpur. We have also written to the Uttarakhand government regarding environment clearance for quarrying in the area. Regarding hydropower projects, we apprise Swami Shivanand Saraswati that no consent has been granted by the ministry for any new project. The government is committed to the conservation of the Ganga. We all are committed and jointly make efforts for its conservation,” said Mishra. After a discussion with the ashram members and Ganga activists, Swami Shivanand Saraswati announced breaking his agitation and sipped water in presence of Ganga Vichar Manch office bearers Bharat Pathak and Ashish Jha.

Expressing happiness over the development, Magsaysay awardee Rajendra Singh said that the demands of Swami Shivanand Saraswati, as well as other seers who previously protested for the cause, are genuine and related to river Ganga, the ecology and environmental concerns. “Government should take prompt and long term measures on demands of these saints who are the real heroes of our country,” said Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/matri-sadan-founder-gives-up-agitation-on-ganga-after-assurance-by-mission-director-101617377885141.html
02-04-2021||Pune||Cleric assault case: Court acquits four accused due to lack of evidence||A Pune court has acquitted four persons who were charged for attacking a Muslim cleric due to lack of evidence. The accused were charged under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) in an FIR lodged against them at Kondhwa police station by the victim in 2014. Additional sessions judge S R Navander ordered acquittal of Dada alias Amit Valmiki Harpale (21), a resident of Phursungi, Deepak Vasant Gorgale (23), a resident of Undri, Dattatreya Rajesh Tak (25), a resident of Pisoli and Srikant Nagesh Malge (29), a resident of Undri for lack of evidence. The fifth accused identified as Atuk Ravindra Kad (27), a resident of Kadnagar in Undri died during the trial. On June 1, 2014 , at 9.45 pm Maulana Ashpaque Ahmed Ansari (40), a resident of Ayesha Masjid in Undri and his brother Izhar Ahmed Ansari ( 30) had finished prayers and were on their way to the Wanowrie Bazaar when they stopped on Bishop’s school road for an auto rickshaw. At that time, they were attacked by the accused with wooden sticks without any valid reason. Ashpaque fell unconscious on the ground and his brother rushed him to Inamdar hospital where he was admitted. Maulana Ashpaque Ansari later lodged an FIR with the Kondhwa police stating that they were assaulted as objectionable photos of deities went viral on social media. Seven witnesses were examined and all of them told the court that they had attempted to murder the victim. The accused were represented by advocate Milind Pawar. The order stated “Based on the circumstantial evidence submitted by the prosecution before the court, it cannot be proved that the accused attacked the victim with sticks. Neither can it prove that they had sticks at the time of the incident which were used as weapons of assault. The court acquits them for want of evidence.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/cleric-assault-case-court-acquits-four-accused-due-to-lack-of-evidence-101617377883634.html
02-04-2021||Pune||Students raise concerns over SPPU exam guidelines||The first semester examination of the Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU) is going to start from April 10 and guidelines regarding conducting the exams have been issued by the university. All SPPU affiliated colleges will be conducting the exams for more than 3,500 subjects in the online mode and its timetable has been declared department wise. Students have raised certain questions over conducting the exam in online mode which will affect the examination as well as the results. As per the guidelines issued by SPPU’s examination department it is stated that, “Students must register themselves for the examination through their mobile or email id. If there is any technical issue raised while appearing for the online exam, then only that specific time period will be increased due to which the exam was delayed.” The most important issue given in the guidelines is about declaration of results within 48 hours after appearing for the exam. “Once the student completes the exam and submits his/her paper, the result will be declared within the next 48 hours on the student profile system. If the student has any doubt or issue with the results, then he/she should immediately apply online in the same system in the next 48 hours. If the student doesn’t apply within the given time, then there won’t be any further complaint will be considered valid,” said Mahesh Kakade, director of the board of examination and evaluation. Last year, the SPPU started its final year exams for 3,300 subjects for which 2.5 lakh students enrolled. From the first day, both online and offline students faced a lot of issues while appearing for the exam and it even continued in the results. While for the offline exams, 113 centres were identified where physical exams were conducted in Pune, Nashik and Ahmednagar districts. These exams were 50 marks with multiple-choice questions (MCQ) for one-hour duration. Strongly opposing these new guidelines specifically about the result, Kuldeep Ambekar, president of students helping hand organisation said, “We all have experienced that there are several technical issues and problems come while appearing for the exam and it continues in result process too. Students had to fight for two to three months to get their results corrected from the university. Now, they are saying that apply within 48 hours to correct the results or later on it won’t be taken. This is not acceptable and there should be a provision to keep offline application for verification or correction of results.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/students-raise-concerns-over-sppu-exam-guidelines-101617377763494.html

02-04-2021||Mumbai||Malavika’s Mumbaistan: Lost star||She would have turned 67 tomorrow, had she lived. How would she have marked the occasion? The last birthday she’d celebrated had been her fiftieth. She’d hosted a dinner for a handful of her friends — the few people who had managed to pierce through the smog of her paranoia and who she had accepted into her inner circle; her trusty manager who’d stuck by her through the savage spins of her tumultuous career; her building watchman along with the neighbourhood handyman; a couple of priests from the Church where she’d been baptized a few months before; and inexplicably, a random fan who had cold-called her and had managed to win her trust. She’d worn her prettiest kaftan and most flamboyant lipstick for the occasion. The table had been laden with dishes which she had prepared herself and glasses were clinked and jokes cracked. But, according to “Parveen Babi: A Life” authored by journalist Karishma Upadhaya, “Under that bright veneer of fun though, there was anxiety, and the laughter had not been as spontaneous as it had once been. The guests found it very hard to ignore the Dictaphone she had casually placed on the coffee table, in between glasses of mocktails and plates of food.’ It was to be one of her last hurrahs. Nine months later, this once-celebrated leading lady of the Indian film industry, a veteran of over 50 movies of which a dozen or so had been blockbusters at the box office, whose face had once adorned the cover of an international magazine when it turned its focus on India’s film industry, was found dead. Her body starved and gangrenous and only discovered two days after her passing, when her building security had alerted the police. Parveen Babi’s life is a morality tale on so many levels. On the most basic level, it teaches us about the dangers of the brittle world of show business and the damage it can wreak on the vulnerable and fragile; it underlines the importance of family and a support system for those in the limelight; it reveals the prejudice and pain endured by intelligent, beautiful and successful women who do not abide by patriarchal societal conventions. But above all, it emphasises the need to de-stigmatise mental illness and the way its victims are viewed and treated. At the height of her illness, when this once celebrated and vivacious leading lady, a woman known for her magnanimity and good manners and her intellect and sophistication, had begun to tell anyone willing to listen that she was the victim of an international conspiracy, that her food was poisoned and that a bugging device had been surgically planted under her ear, the media and the public had lapped it up. “She’s gone crazy”, “She’s lost her mind” the headlines had screamed. Sixteen years ago, the empathy and sensitivity for those suffering from mental illness had been more absent than it is today. An overweight, unkempt Babi spewing fantastic conspiracy theories was given none of the support and understanding that she so urgently required. Alone and friendless in Mumbai (according to some versions she rebuffed their overtures and stonewalled their solicitations), she was a walking train wreck, a tragedy waiting to happen in full public view, and no one, not her family, her lovers, colleagues, nor her adoring fans had stepped forward to prevent it. Would things have been different if it had happened sixteen years later, today? Perhaps not. Yes, since Babi’s death there have been others in the public eye who have tried to bring about a more empathetic understanding of mental illness. Deepika Padukone was brave enough to share her own; Ira Rao, Aamir Khan’s daughter, courageously faces prejudice stigma and vicious trolling each day as she recounts her tryst with depression; and Neerja Birla, through her NGO Mpower, have attempted to educate the public about its vicissitudes. But these interventions have been a drop in the ocean against the tide of misunderstanding and prejudice. We have only to look back as recently as last year to know how Sushant Singh Rajput’s struggle with depression and his ultimate suicide resulted in a heinous media circus that engulfed the nation. According to her friends, before Babi’s illness manifested itself, she had been a warm, effervescent and hardworking woman who had achieved a fair measure of success in a very competitive and demanding industry through her own merit. Why then had she ended up so alone and ill? The answer lies in our individual responses to mental illness. How would we respond to a manic and distraught Parveen Babi today? In a world already so fraught and hard-hearted, who would have the compassion and sensitivity to view someone with Babi’s affliction with the empathy and sensitivity it deserved? Which of her friends and colleagues would have the patience and perseverance to assist her in accessing the medical help that she so urgently required? Which media outlets would turn down the opportunity to make fodder of her illness or moolah out of the TRP it generated and leave her alone until she had healed? As for her doting fans and the general public, would anyone have cared to look beyond the manifestations of her paranoid schizophrenia and see the unwell and ailing woman under it, crying out for help? Sixteen years ago, a once-strong and successful woman was allowed to suffer unimaginable pain and to die alone. The tragedy is that were the same circumstances to present themselves today, she’d probably have met the same fate, or worse given the all-pervasive presence of social media and its army of trolls. “The death of human empathy is one of the earliest and most telling signs of a culture about to fall into barbarism,” Wrote political theorist Hannah Arendt, an early victim of Hitler’s anti-Semitism. On the eve of what would have been her 67th birth anniversary, what does it say about the prevailing culture of our time that had she been alive, Parveen Babi would perhaps still not get the understanding or empathy that she required? It is a sobering thought, one that should engage us far more than it does.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/malavikas-mumbaistan-lost-star-101617374884028.html

The Hussainabad and Allied Trust (HAT) — the custodian of the imambada – made it clear that the wall was not a heritage structure. The trust blamed the Jal Nigam for the collapse as the civic agency was carrying out deep sewer line laying work along the wall. “Though the wall belonged to the Shahnajaf Imambada, it was not a heritage structure. The wall possibly collapsed due to the ongoing deep sewer line laying work being carried out along the wall the by Jal Nigam,” said Santosh Kumar, additional city magistrate (ACM) II, who holds charge of HAT secretary. He said the wall was recently repaired by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI).Sanjay Kumar Singh, chief engineer Jal Nigam (Lucknow zone) said the wall of Shahnajaf Imambada collapsed due to excessive mud pressure. “That was not a heritage wall.

The Electricity Act, 2003, already prohibits unmetered supply of power to any consumer. “All the efforts by the state government and the UP Power Corporaion Ltd (UPPCL) management as well as repeated orders by the UP Electricity Regulatory Commission (UPERC) have failed to convince or force power employees to install energy metres in their houses,” a senior energy department official said. The UPERC recently sought a status report from the UPPCL on the number of power employees in whose houses meters have been installed before it admitted and approved the latter’s annual revenue requirement (ARR) proposal for 2021-22. The corporation had no reply to the question. “We sought information on the number of power personnel who have been connected to metered supply so far but they did not give any direct reply,” said RP Singh, UPERC chairman. UPPCL chairman M Devraj refused to comment on the issue. “No comment please,” he said when asked to tell if the corporation had any action plan to install meters on the premises owned by power employees and pensioners. The UPERC, in its September 3, 2019 tariff order, abolished the separate category (LMV-10) that was meant for unmetered supply to powermen and put them into the MLV-1 tariff category applicable for domestic consumers. “After the UPERC abolished the power employees’ separate tariff category and put them in the schedule applicable to any other domestic consumer, the UPPCL should have installed meters at power employees’ residences or started doing normative billing in their case (as is done in case of domestic consumers whose meter is defective or have no meter at all) till the meters were installed,” a senior official pointed out. Under the rules prevailing till the 2019 tariff order, power employees would pay minimum monthly charges fixed for them for unmetered and unlimited electricity use. The charges were deducted from their monthly salary. “Now, even those minimum charges are not being deducted from their salary because doing it is legally not possible after the UPERC abolished employees’ separate tariff category,” the official claimed.

02-04-2021||Dehradun||Tirath Singh Rawat govt overturns previous leadership’s major move||Chief minister Tirath Singh Rawat-led Uttarakhand government on Friday reversed one more major decision of the previous government led by Trivendra Singh Rawat. The state government decided to remove all non-government appointments and nominations made for the post of chairmen, vice-chairmen, advisors in corporations, commissions, civic bodies, councils and those with the status of a minister or minister of state in such bodies. The move applies to all appointments made since March 18, 2017, except in cases where such appointments were made on constitutional posts for fixed periods. The order in this regard was issued by chief secretary Om Prakash on Friday. Such appointments are generally made from among party leaders on the directions of the chief minister keeping various political equations and regional considerations in mind. Opposition Congress termed the development an expression of the ongoing infighting and power struggle within the state BJP unit. Pritam Singh, state Congress president, said that all such appointments and nominations in such bodies were made by the BJP government. “It was not as if the government had changed and it was necessary to remove such people. It is a clear indication that it is another decision that has been reversed. There is infighting in the state BJP due to which many decisions of the previous government are being changed. All this shows that the BJP has misled the people for four years and now in the last year, they are bringing changes, which won’t fool people here anymore”. A close aide of former CM Trivendra Singh Rawat, wishing not to be named, said that whenever a new chief minister takes over, he has the right to select his ministers and appoint people in such bodies. “Every new CM makes these changes. Nothing more should be read in this development beyond that,” he said. The official added that since 2017, around 70 to 80 such appointments had been made in such bodies by the previous government. The BJP called the development a routine affair, adding that the Congress is unnecessary raking up the issue as it has been its habit in most cases. Devendra Bhasin, state BJP spokesperson, said it is a routine development with every new CM, whether it is the BJP or the Congress. “The new CM will choose new party members, who may even include some old ones as well. Our government had appointed around 70 to 80 people, while the Congress government in the past had appointed over 200 or so. They should see what they had done when they were in power and then comment on us,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/tirath-singh-rawat-govt-overturns-previous-leadership-s-major-move-101617370083838.html

The Pune administration, however, has decided against imposing complete lockdown similar to last year even as cases are rising sharply with the weekly positivity rate touching 32%. Amid a massive surge in Covid-19 infections, Pune Divisional Commissioner Saurabh Rao announced fresh restrictions after reviewing the situation in the city, at a meeting chaired by deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar on Friday. Although new measures have been taken, all essential services are exempted from the restrictions. Besides curfew post evening, the assembly of more than four people has been prohibited during the daytime too.The administration has also suspended the public transport service run by PMPML for common people.

But this week the positivity rate has reached 32 per cent. According to health experts, if this situation persists, we will have 9000 Covid-19 cases per day from the existing daily caseload of 8000. After the discussion in the meeting with elected representatives these decisions have been taken. We are also focusing on increasing health infrastructure by ramping up beds,” Rao.As part of the new curbs, weekly markets in rural areas of the district and parts of the city have been banned while the Market Yard (Agriculture Produce Market Committee) at Gultekdi will be operational under the watch of authorities to ensure the guidelines are being followed.

He said a total of 71,000 beneficiaries in Delhi were given doses on Thursday of which only four people experienced some reactions and got recovered in an hour or two.“However, we are facing two problems. Firstly, as per the Centre’s guidelines, vaccinations can only be done at hospitals and health facilities. Initially, there were fears that if people experience any side effects or reactions after taking the dose, there had to be a facility where they can be immediately treated. But it has been three months since vaccination started. And it is proven that vaccines are safe,” he said.Also Read| No lockdown in Delhi, situation not as serious as before, says KejriwalThe chief minister pointed out that if vaccination begins at a mass level at non-hospital facilities, the Covid-19 disease can be brought under control.

Eshwarappa had made serious allegations against chief minister Yediyurappa, giving the Opposition the opportunity to approach the Governor and demand President’s rule in the state.State BJP chief Nalin Kumar Kateel told reporters in Mangaluru, “This will end well.In the next two days, I will only resolve it.” He said that the party is reviewing all incidents that have taken place in the last two days and they will discuss it with all those involved and resolve the issue.Kateel’s assurance comes a couple of days after Eshwarappa, the rural development and panchayati raj minister, made allegations of interference against chief minister Yediyurappa and called his administration “authoritarian”.The developments have given the Opposition more ammunition to attack an already pressured Yediyurappa government. The incident has also given rise to the speculation that the attacks against the chief minister had the BJP’s sanction. Eshwarappa alleged that he held back the approval to three projects, totalling ₹1,299 crore, which Yediyurappa was forcing the department to approve after bypassing the minister in charge.Also Read | K’taka minister’s letter fans new political rowDismissing claims that he was targeting the CM over their personal differences, Eshwarappa on Friday said that he was merely trying to reinstate the practice of following rules and procedures.“I am not a rebel, I am loyal,” he said as he pointed out that Yediyurappa left the BJP in 2012 and formed the Karnataka Janata Party.The two leaders are from Shivamogga and share a tempestuous relationship.On Thursday, Congress legislature party leader Siddaramaiah had urged the Karnataka Governor to intervene, remove Yediyurappa and recommend President’s Rule in the state.Eshwarappa’s criticism has added to the pressure on Yediyurappa who faces dissent from within the party and government. With the Covid-19 situation deteriorating steadily, the CM is also struggling to keep the numbers down without having to implement strict restrictions or lockdown-like measures.To add to the CM’s woes, voices within the party have been growing against Yediyurappa and his second son, BY Vijayendra, who has been accused of running a parallel administration. The upcoming bypolls in Basavakalyan, Belagavi and Maski presented an opportunity for Yediyurappa to silence some of this dissent but the sex scandal involving Ramesh Jarkiholi and Eshwarappa’s allegations have dented the party’s prospects.Basanagouda Patil (Yatnal), the legislator from Bijapur City continues to attack the chief minister, calling for his removal.However, Kateel said that Yatnal and Eshwarappa’s cases were different. He said the party had issued a notice to Yatnal and that the legislator will respond to it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/eshwarappa-plaints-against-cm-will-be-resolved-in-2-days-karnataka-bjp-chief-101617366783742.html

On his complaint, RPF took off the nuns and the postulants from the Odisha-bound Utkal Express on March 19.Yadav said Tiwari later lodged a formal complaint with GRP in Jhansi on March 19. . Yadav said the three were building pressure on the police to act upon the complaint.An inquiry into the harassment was ordered late last month hours after Union home minister Amit Shah assured at a public rally in election-bound Kerala that strong action would be taken against those who harassed the nuns. The issue snowballed into a major controversy after Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan and Congress leader Rahul Gandhi took the nuns’ case up when the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is reaching out to the Christian community, which accounts for 16% of the electorate in Kerala.Also Read | Kerala nun harassment case: Investigating officer picked for probeABVP is a student organisation affiliated with Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, the BJP’s ideological fount.The nuns and postulants belong to New Delhi’s Sacred Hearts Congregation.

The auspicious ritual of Dharm Dhwaja was carried out at Bairagi Akhada’s camp on Friday.This is the second time when chief minister Tirath Singh Rawat directed officials to do so. On March 11, Rawat had ordered flowers to be showered on pilgrims and Akhada seers in Haridwar on the occasion of the first Shahi Snan (holy royal dip) on Shivratri. “We thank the state government for ensuring showering of petals through helicopters earlier during Shahi Snan of Maha Shivratri and now during the religious flag hoisting at Kankhal of Bairagi Akhadas.

While Sanyasi Akhada’s religious flag was hoisted in March, the flag of three Bairagi Akhadas, which include Nirmohi, Nirvani and Digambar akhadas, was hoisted a day after the notification for Mahakumbh came into effect on Friday. To mark the major occasion, saints representing all thirteen Akhadas, along with Kumbh mela officer-in-charge Deepak Rawat and Kumbh mela force Inspector-General of Police Sanjay Gunjiyal, were present during the flag hoisting. As soon as the flag was hoisted, a chopper showered flowers on seers, devotees and tourists. Shri Panch Nirmohi Akhada’s spiritual ideologue, Shri Mahant Rajendra Das, said that with the hoisting of the religious flag and offering of prayers to Lord Hanuman, Akhada activities related to the Kumbh fair will begin on a wider scale. Akhada seers, as well as followers, have already started arriving for the Kumbh fair at the Bairagi camp. “First, rituals are carried out to worship mother earth (Bhoomi Pujan) after which the religious flag is hoisted. This is followed by offering prayers to the respective deity of all Akhadas. The religious flag remains throughout the tenure of Mahakumbh and is symbolic of the respective Akhada tradition, custom, presence and identity as well the Kumbh fair,” said Mahant Hari Giri Maharaj, international convener of Shri Panch Dashnam Juna Akhada.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/helicopter-showers-petals-as-akhadas-hoist-flag-on-day-2-of-mahakumbh-101617362643373.html
02-04-2021||Pune||Slam Dunk: One size does not fit all – how basketball shapes shoe technology||In one of the most famous and popular commercials advertising and promoting Air Jordan shoes, the fictional character Mars Blackmon exclaims to Michael Jordan the famous phrase, “It’s gotta be the shoes!” While we clearly must not attribute the global success of Michael Jordan solely to his sneakers, there is no arguing the importance of his footwear as one of the primary components that catapulted his worldwide notoriety to levels never seen in a basketball player. In fact, one of the most coveted honours that a player can receive nowadays, is to have a shoe company create a “signature shoe”, customized, in which the individual player leads the entire concept and creative design process and vision for the shoe company. Currently, there are only 16 players in the NBA who have their own signature shoe with a particular shoe brand. Basketball shoe technology has evolved significantly since the heyday of canvas Converse sneakers being used in the early 1970s. As the speed of the game and athletic ability of players has been maximised, shoes have become more important than ever to player performance. A unique angle of individual player signature shoes is their ability to tell a story through the design and color of the shoes. Primarily, the shoes serve as a performance vehicle for a player to feel as comfortable and powerful as possible during game play. Shoe technology has closely reflected the evolution of basketball game play in the NBA. While the earlier versions of the modern game emphasised physical contact, slower tempo and limited space to move freely on court, shoes designed by manufacturers such as Nike, featured higher ankle supports, more rigid outsoles and premium air cushions, which contributed to the overall support of the shoes. The trade off in utilising air cushion technology such as the Nike Shox technology, was a large increase in the absolute weight of basketball shoes. As the game has progressed to increasing in speed, with players required to cover more ground and decelerate aggressively, shoe technology has morphed and focused on becoming lighter, while staying low to the ground and providing enough support to avoid ankle sprains. One of the first low-top basketball signature shoes was the Adidas Gil Zero made for Washington Wizards star guard Gilbert Arenas. However, low-top shoes were more commonly accepted after Kobe Bryant’s championship runs wearing low top Nike sneakers. The late 2000s also spurred Nike Flywire technology, which allowed shoes to maintain their support while not compromising on the overall weight and keeping the shoe low to the ground. Among contemporary sneakers, observing the playing style of Stephen Curry clearly shows the essential necessity of a basketball shoe that needs to have extreme traction while not compromising on comfort or weight. The recently released Curry 8 has pioneered the revolutionary “Flow” technology, which has made it the first basketball shoe to be created with a non-rubber and all foam sole, continuing to push the envelope even further on what is possible for performance in basketball shoes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/slam-dunk-one-size-does-not-fit-all-how-basketball-shapes-shoe-technology-101617362166527.html
02-04-2021||Chandigarh||HP health secy reviews Covid test, track and treat strategy||Amid the surge in Covid-19 cases in Himachal Pradesh, health secretary Amitabh Avasthi on Friday called for the efficient implementation of the test, track and treat strategy to control community transmission of the virus. Presiding over a review meeting with district officials through video-conference to review the evolving situation amid the second wave of Covid-19, Avasthi said all individuals with fever or flu-like symptoms should be tested and those who turn positive should be isolated. Also read: ‘Nobody wants lockdown but..’: Mumbai mayor warns of stricter Covid-19 normsThe district authorities have been told that all possible close contacts of positive persons must be traced within 48 hours and appropriately quarantined and subsequently tested for Covid-19 according to the protocol. Avasthi said more than 70% of the total testing should be through RT-PCR. He pointed to the low percentage of RT-PCR tests in districts such as Bilaspur, Kinnaur, Kullu, Lahaul and Spiti and Mandi. Districts told to activate Covid facilities Deputy commissioners were asked to conduct a meticulous analysis of the situation and containment zones. All districts were directed to activate the dedicated Covid facilities in view of the increasing number of cases. “Quality services in terms of diet, sanitation and treatment should be provided to patients admitted in hospitals,” he said and directed regular monitoring of home isolated patients. Eighty ambulances have again been deployed in all 12 districts. “Border districts of Una, Kangra, Solan and Sirmaur need to be more vigilant given the inter-state movement in these districts,” he said. Vaccination lagging in Solan, Sirmaur and ChambaThe health secretary said people were not taking precautionary measures and should be made aware through all the available channels. He called for holding vigorous vaccination drives in areas where more cases were being reported. He said Himachal figures among the few states to have vaccinated more than 30% of the estimated 60+ population. He said the vaccination drive is lagging in Solan, Sirmaur and Chamba districts and asked the authorities to increase the pace.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hp-health-secy-reviews-covid-test-track-and-treat-strategy-101617362164937.html
02-04-2021||Delhi||Covid-19: A look at Delhi’s health apparatus for patients in home isolation||Manoj Jha, 53, a Delhi government schoolteacher, makes phone calls throughout an eight-hour shift and records details of Covid-19 patients under isolation. They tell him about breathlessness and other complications, which may need immediate medical intervention.“The details have to be accurate,” said Jha. “Name, address, pulse rate, oxygen saturation levels, type of symptoms, etc. All patients isolated at their residences are given pulse oximeters. Last November was madness. It looks like we are headed towards another such phase.”At the peak of the pandemic, Delhi recorded 8,593 cases on November 11. There has been a fresh spike in cases with the number of active Covid-19 cases increasing from 1,404 on March 1 to 10,498 on April 1. With the rising numbers, the government is investing in strengthening the home isolation monitoring system to keep the pressure off the health infrastructure system, officials said.People such as Jha and health officials posted in government dispensaries are part of the lowest rung of a multi-layered monitoring system that oversees home isolated patients.Delhi has 11 revenue districts. Each district has one such control room. Also, there are 260 government dispensaries.Also Read | Fresh restrictions in Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh districts amid Covid-19 surge“When cases increase, our daily routines get more hectic,” said Praveen Kumar, another teacher, who has also been working as a home isolation control room operator.Of the 10,498 active Covid-19 cases in Delhi as of April 1, as many as 5,698 were in home isolation. As of March 1, the home isolation number was 739.On Thursday, Delhi recorded 2,790 new cases, the highest in nearly four months. As the numbers go up, strengthening the home isolation system essentially means scaling up preparedness for handling a higher number of follow up cases a day, maintaining a quick, simple and efficient system to deal with emergencies, and building up a stronger check and balance system to ensure that people are not violating isolation rules.More cases mean an increased probability of emergency situations. The emergency handling system for home isolation cases operates stage by stage in Delhi. It involves control room doctors, nurses in dispensaries, primary health nursing officers in sub-divisions, doctors engaged by the government for home isolation, and bureaucrats monitoring the system.Over 300,000 Covid-19 patients have recovered at their homes. While 43 of them died last year – either at home or while being taken to hospital or in less than 24 hours of hospitalisation, there have been no such deaths so far this year.Home isolation is for Covid-19 patients with mild or no symptoms who can afford to isolate themselves from other family members at their residences. Patients in home isolation are supposed to remain isolated for 10 days after the onset of symptoms -- or testing positive, in case there are no symptoms – provided they do not have fever for three consecutive days.What happens when a patient suddenly develops symptoms, which need medical intervention and hospitalisation?“Emergency contact numbers are shared with each patient in home isolation. They have to either call up their nearest dispensary from which they receive health check calls or call up the district control room. These are the first contact points. Dispensaries operate from 9am to 5pm. Beyond these hours, the control room is the only contact point in case of an emergency,” said Aman Prasad, a nodal officer for home isolation cases.On receiving emergency calls, dispensary officials and control room operators are supposed to note down details thoroughly and then share the contact numbers of a public health nursing officer (PHNO) for further help. In case the patients fail to connect PHNOs, the dispensary officials and control room operators have to ensure that the PHNOs call the patients at the earliest.“But it is easier said than done,” said a nurse with a government dispensary, who did not wish to be identified. “Once a patient called up saying he needed medical help immediately. It was evident from his voice that he was suffering from breathlessness. While I checked for the concerned PHNO during the call, I could hear the patient’s voice go weak. It was around 2am. I was sweating with anxiety. But we finally managed. The patient was moved to a hospital and later recovered from Covid-19.”Each revenue district has three subdivisions. Each subdivision has two to three such nursing officers. PHNOs are supposed to brief patients about what to do and connect them with a doctor.“As the doctor takes up the case, the PHNOs start arranging for oxygen concentrators and an ambulance to be sent to the patient’s residence. They do not have to wait for the doctor’s approval for that. The aim is to save time. Every district has stocks of oxygen concentrators and a few reserved ambulances. The doctors are supposed to assess if the patients need hospitalisation and help with arrangements in that regard,” said a PHNO, who did not wish to be identified.While PHNOs and doctors form the middle rungs of the hierarchy in the multi-layered monitoring system of home isolation cases, bureaucrats are at the top of it.“We have to constantly look out for gaps to be plugged and strategies to make the emergency system more efficient. This is one aspect of home isolation management. We also have to ensure that there are teams to conduct surprise checks on home isolation patients to check for potential violation of rules. We have teams to ensure that essentials are delivered to their residence,” said Dharmendra Kumar, additional district magistrate (West Delhi).Chief secretary Vijay Dev said Delhi was one of the first states to implement a home isolation model. “With time we have further invested in the system, plugged gaps, and scaled up surveillance. The results are visible. We have a better and stronger model in place now. We have had a successful home isolation model in Delhi because each stage of the system -- from the point at which one tests positive to the point at which the patient recovers -- is closely monitored and there is a systematic way to deal with any kind of emergency. Consequently, there have been no deaths in the last three months in the robust home isolation system being followed in Delhi.”Lalit Kant, a former head of the division of epidemiology and communicable diseases at the Indian Council of Medical Research, said a strong and efficient home isolation model is important to ensure that people do not hesitate to get tested for Covid-19, especially when cases are increasing. “But it is also essential to carefully assess the feasibility of each home isolation case. There has to be a separate room, a washroom, and another person in the same house to help during potential emergencies. Improper home isolation assignments can lead to higher transmission of the disease. Also, there should be strong checks and balances in place to ensure that people adhere to home isolation rules.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/covid19-a-look-at-delhi-s-health-apparatus-for-patients-in-home-isolation-101617362163551.html

02-04-2021||Jaipur||‘Covid-19 now more dangerous, majority in 2nd wave asymptomatic’: Gehlot||Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot on Friday said the majority of Covid-19 patients infected in the second wave were asymptomatic and the virus was now more dangerous as it could spread rapidly through asymptomatic patients, who do not adhere to Covid appropriate behaviour.“Majority of the patients in this second wave are asymptomatic. Earlier, the symptoms were visible in the patients and it was easy to identify and quarantine them. But identification of patients with no symptoms is difficult without a test. Such a patient is not even aware of his own infection,” Gehlot tweeted.He added that such a situation warranted strict compliance to Covid-19 protocols as several unaware asymptomatic patients were likely to be moving around in public increasing the threat of infection to others.“Now the coronavirus has become more dangerous than before. In such a situation, we all have to show seriousness. I again appeal to everyone to strictly follow the protocol of wearing masks, washing hands and maintaining social distancing. Even a little carelessness can cause someone’s life,” one of his tweets on the issue said.The chief minister presented data to underscore the rapid spread of the virus in the second wave. He said within 43 days between February 16 and April 1, daily reporting of Covid cases jumped to 1350 from 60. He added that from 1195 active cases on February 23, the number had risen to 9563 on April 1 as the case doubling rate of 2521 days as seen on February 24 had declined sharply to 270 days now.Gehlot’s expression of concern comes at a time when new infections have nearly tripled in the last ten days with 1,350 cases reported across the state on April 1, compared to only 476 on March 21. Total Covid-19 infections registered in the state reached 334,499 on Thursday, while the death toll mounted to 28,222 as four more people succumbed to the disease. So far, 322,114 people have recovered from Covid-19, a health department release said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/covid19-now-more-dangerous-majority-in-2nd-wave-asymptomatic-gehlot-101617359883393.html
02-04-2021||Dehradun||Uttarakhand: Tirath Singh Rawat cancels political appointments by previous govt||Uttarakhand government on Friday reversed another major decision by previous chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat by cancelling all the political appointments and nominations made in state corporations, commissions, civic bodies, councils since March 18, 2017, including for posts with status of minister or minister of state, except for constitutional posts of fixed tenure. Opposition Congress said it was another proof of “infighting” and “power struggle” in state BJP. “It was not as if the government changed and it was necessary to remove such people. It is clear that another decision has been reversed. There is infighting and power struggle in the state BJP due to which, many decisions of the previous government are being changed. All this shows that the BJP misled the people for four years and is bringing changes in the last year. This won’t fool people here anymore,” said Pritam Singh, state Congress president. However, a close aide of former chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat, wishing not to be named, said the new chief minister has the right to select his ministers and make fresh appointments to such bodies. “Every new CM makes these changes. Nothing much should be read into this development beyond that,” he said, adding that around 70 to 80 such appointments were made since 2017 by the Trivendra Singh Rawat government. BJP state unit’s official spokesperson too termed the development as routine while dismissing allegations levelled by the Congress. “New CM will choose new party members, which may also include some old ones. Our government appointed around 70 to 80 people, while the Congress government in the past appointed over 200 people or so. They should first see what they did when in power before commenting on us,” said Devendra Bhasin, state BJP spokesperson.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/uttarakhand-tirath-singh-rawat-cancels-political-appointments-by-previous-govt-101617357003296.html
02-04-2021||Chandigarh||Flame of the Forest blooms bright and early in Himachal||Rhododendrons, the first among flowers in the wild to signal a shift to spring as the chill thaws, have arrived three weeks ahead of schedule in Himachal Pradesh, causing concern among environmentalists. “Early flowering in the rhododendron is usually the result of less snow and it has an adverse impact on the seed setting,” says Himachal Pradesh’s principal chief conservator of forests, Savita. “We will study this phenomenon. I had noticed a similar trend in 2016 when I was posted at the Forest Research Institute in Dehradun. The rhododendrons in and around the hill station of Mussoorie had bloomed as early as January and villagers considered it ominous.” Though the blooming of the Flame of the Forest, as the state flower of Himachal Pradesh is also known as, is celebrated as it indicates the end of a harsh winter, this year the flowering has been erratic and premature. It’s folklore in the hills that the early blooming affects the crop cycle. Warmer winter, sunny spring leads to early blooming Rhododendron arboreum needs a temperature of 15-20 degrees Celsius to bloom. It is the average temperature in April in the middle and higher reaches of the Himalayas. “But the winter months this time recorded higher temperatures, leading to the early flowering. There was a lot of sun in March,” says Manmohan Singh, the director of the regional meteorological office in Shimla. This year, the state received 80% deficient rainfall in February and 62% in March, he says. “The changing phenomenon in the flowering pattern of the rhododendron requires deeper study. The sudden spurt of warmth is a concern. The changing flowering pattern can threaten the existence of these beautiful trees,” says Himachal-based author and historian Raja Bhasin. Changing pattern, shifting of baseline concern scientists Himachal Pradesh is home to two main varieties of the flower: The pink (rhododendron cinnamomeum) and red (rhododendron arboreum). The red flowers grow in the wild at an altitude of 6,000 ft to 8,000 ft, while the pink variety is found in the higher reaches of the Himalayas, ranging from 8,000 ft to 11,000 ft. Besides the changing flowering pattern, scientists are concerned about the shifting of the baseline of the rhododendron. “Rhododendron is getting rare and shifting its altitude. The variation in the rainfall pattern and the rise in temperature is the cause. This is the time to conserve and save this rare, beautiful flower,” says Suresh Attri, the principal scientific officer in the state government’s department of science, technology and environment. Experts working on climate change in the region have shared the concern. “The pink variety is not visible in the lower altitudes anymore and the red can be found in Kullu through the Prasher valley route. It’s time to organise conservation efforts and sensitise the local population so that there is awareness to protect this flower,” says Monica Sharma, a research scholar. Medicinal value of rhododendron The flower, which has medicinal value, grows in the wild in neighbouring Uttarakhand and Jammu and Kashmir, too. Locally known as buras, the flowers help in heart ailments and controlling blood pressure. The flowers are also offered in the hill temples and used to make chutney with pomegranate seeds besides squashes. To beautify their summer capital, the British had planted red rhododendrons in Jakhu, Tara Devi, Summer Hill, Chowra Maidan and Boileauganj and they continue to bloom bright and beautiful even today.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/flame-of-the-forest-blooms-bright-and-early-in-himachal-101617356643425.html

Pednekar’s warning comes a day after Mumbai recorded the highest single-day spike of 8,646 cases on Thursday and hours before chief minister Uddhav Thackeray is set to hold a meeting over the surge in infections across Maharashtra.Thackeray will address the state at 8:30pm after Friday’s meeting with officials over the Covid-19 situation in the state and is likely to announce fresh curbs. The chief minister has already declared a state-wide night curfew from Sunday under the Maharashtra government's 'Mission Begin Again' programme.Follow latest updates on Covid-19 here“Nobody wants lockdown but keeping in mind the manner in which cases are rising and creating pressure on the health infrastructure, some strict measures will have to be taken,” the Mumbai mayor told news agency ANI.The western state witnessed a record jump of 43,183 Covid-19 cases on Thursday, which is the highest single-day spike since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic. As many as 139 fatalities were also reported, data showed.“Due to the surge, a shortage of beds and ventilators is also being seen. We had been appealing to people since last March but they are showing carelessness,” Pednekar said pointing to infrastructural challenges following the spike.The mayor hinted at stricter curbs including shutting of malls, religious places, and restrictions on travel in local trains on Thursday. She, however, said there were enough beds to accommodate the increasing number of Covid-19 patients. “There are enough beds to handle the increasing number of cases, but we have to act wisely before the city enters the danger zone,” she told reporters.The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has maintained it has not decided about the lockdown yet. In order to curb the chain of transmission, the civic body has asked officials to ensure that home isolated patients monitor their health and take treatment for the viral infection.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/nobody-wants-lockdown-but-mumbai-mayor-warns-of-stricter-covid-19-norms-101617355027212.html
02-04-2021||Jaipur||Rajasthan MLA suggests using Camels for patrolling in wildlife sanctuaries||Rajasthan MLA from Kota’s Sangod, Bharat Singh, who is also a member of the state wildlife board, has suggested that patrolling in state’s wildlife sanctuaries and tiger reserves is done using camels for greater efficiency and to aid camel conservation.In his letter to Mohanlal Meena, the chief wildlife warden of Rajasthan, Bharat Singh claimed that the camel population was declining in the state due to lesser demand for camel rides. He said the issue had often been raised in the state assembly and argued that engaging camels for patrolling in sanctuaries could prove to be a win-win formula for all parties.“Since the vehicles of the wildlife department break down frequently and go through intense wear and tear due to use on the rough and often muddy roads in the wildlife sanctuaries, camels can be used for patrolling in the wildlife sanctuaries and tiger reserves,” his letter said.He cited the use of camels by the Border Security Force (BSF) in the state and said the animals could also be reared for patrolling purposes by the wildlife department.“The forest guards are hesitant to patrol on foot, so if they are provided camels then 2 forest guards can patrol on a single camel in the wildlife sanctuaries and tiger reserves in the manner BSF jawans patrol border areas for security,” he said.Reasoning that the camel rides may also attract tourists, Singh further suggested that the experiment could begin with 6 camel-mounted patrols at Mukundra Hills Tiger reserve in Kota since the area provided for enough fodder and facilities for rearing camels. He further suggested that patrolling on camels can also be done on contract basis.Singh has urged that the proposal be discussed in the state wildlife board’s next meeting.Chief conservator of forest, Mukundra Hills Tiger reserve, SR Yadav said that the idea could be feasible in wildlife sanctuaries situated in desert areas but was unlikely to work in hilly areas.Chief wildlife warden of Rajasthan Mohan Lal Meena said the MLA’s suggestions will be debated before any decision is taken on this matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/rajasthan-mla-suggests-using-camels-for-patrolling-in-wildlife-sanctuaries-101617354063166.html

It is my great privilege that I am getting the opportunity to join this Dandi Yatra today, organised in the memory of the Father of the Nation, Mahatma Gandhi's Dandi Salt Satyagraha,” Chouhan said.The chief minister said while the Father of the Nation brought freedom to the country and Sardar Vallbhbhai Patel united it, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is building a “self-reliant India.” Through this Dandi Yatra, he said, “we all resolve to build a self-reliant India.”The chief minister further remarked that in the history of 1000 years of the world, “there has been no personality like Mahatma Gandhiji”, who has given the freedom to the country through non-violence. “We did not get freedom from the British easily. On one hand, there was Gandhiji's nonviolent movement, and on the other hand, thousands of revolutionaries sacrificed their lives for the freedom of the country,” he said.Chouhan also said that from the very day that Prime Minister Modi announced the creation of a self-reliant India, the state government has been working at great speed to make Madhya Pradesh self-reliant. “Self-Reliant India is a Mantra for us. We will fulfill it with full devotion, effort and dedication,” the chief minister said.He said that Gujarat has given great personalities like Mahatma Gandhi, Vallabhbhai Patel and PM Modi to the country.“During my visit to Gujarat, I performed darshan and pujan of Mother Narmada and Maa Tapti, this morning. Both the rivers originate from Madhya Pradesh, flow in Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat and connect both the states with hearts,” CM Chouhan said.Gujarat’s minister of forest and tribal welfare Raman Lal Patkar and Darshana Jardosh, member of Parliament from Surat, were also present on the occasion.Prime Minister Modi flagged off the “Azadi ka Amrut Mahotsav” on March 12 ahead of 75 years of India’s Independence in August 2022 to commemorate 91 years of Dandi March.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/mp-cm-attends-dandi-yatra-in-gujarat-calls-it-resolve-for-self-reliant-india-101617345503405.html
02-04-2021||Patna||March from historic Vrindavan ashram to mark Gandhi’s 1st visit to Bihar||A march starting from the historic Vrindavan ashram in West Champaran district of Bihar will be held on April 10 to mark the 75th anniversary of Independence and Mahatma Gandhi’s first visit to Bihar in 1917 in support of Indigo farmers, suffering under the British rule. Union minister of art and culture Prahlad Singh Patel and Bihar deputy chief minister Renu Devi will attend the event, Bihar BJP state president and West Champaran MP Sanjay Jaiswal said on Thursday.“The event is being organised as part of Amrut Mahotsav, by the government of India, to commemorate the 75th anniversary of India’s Independence, kick started by Prime Minister Narendra Modi,” said Jaiswal.Jaiswal said the march from Vrindavan Ashram, featuring several leaders, will culminate into a cultural programme at Bettiah’s Raj Kachahari grounds on April 10. Mahatma Gandhi had reached Patna on April 10, 1917 for his first visit to Bihar to first hand witness the plight of indigo planters of West Champaran. Gandhi’s visit snowballed into his first satyagraha in the country after return from South Africa.Later in 1939, Gandhi, persuaded by Prajapati Mishra, the then Bihar Congress president, organised the fifth Gandhi Seva Sangh Conference at Vrindavan ashram between May 2 and May 9. The conference highlighted the need for basic education and total dependence on indigenous goods as means to arouse mass consciousness against the British rule, paving the way for establishing basic education schools and khadi gramodyog kendra in erstwhile Champaran.Spread over 2.5 km wide area, Vrindavan ashram houses private cottages, orchards and Gandhian memorials. Gandhi had addressed a gathering here after the conclusion of the fifth Gandhi Seva Sangh Conference in 1939.The two basic education schools Gandhi started here- Rajkiya Bunyadi Vidyalaya and Rajkiya Bunyadi Kanya Vidyalaya, have witnessed a decline in the past few years with shrinking students size and the locals citing poor quality of teaching as the chief reason.From 735 students in 2016-17, the strength at Rajkiya Bunyadi Vidyalaya came down to 617 in 2017-18, followed by 510 in 2018-19, 448 in 2019-20 and 444 in 2020-21. Similarly, the student strength at Rajkiya Bunyadi Kanya Vidyalaya has come down to 250 odd in the current session.Teachers allege discontinuation of incentives like scholarship, dress compensation etc in the past few years, coupled with poor remuneration for the teachers, as the primary reasons for the decline. “Though the scholarship and dress compensation have been reinstated, the teachers here get mere ₹6,500 as salary. Moreover, Rajkiya Bunyadi Vidyalaya continues to function without a regular headmaster,” said a teacher, who didn’t wish to be named.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/march-from-historic-vrindavan-ashram-to-mark-gandhi-s-1st-visit-to-bihar-101617336782271.html

The Ghazipur border, which connects Uttar Pradesh with Delhi, was opened partially as vehicular movement from Delhi to Ghaziabad was allowed on the stretch.“Ghazipur NH-24 upper side towards Ghaziabad is open for traffic movement. Chilla border between Noida and Delhi is open on both sides,” a traffic police officer said. The Delhi Traffic Police have diverted the traffic that may possibly lead to traffic congestions in parts of the city during the peak hours. According to Delhi Traffic Police officials, vehicles entering Delhi from Ghaziabad are being diverted to alternate border routes such as Anand Vihar, Surya Nagar, Apsara, Bhopra, Loni, Kondli, Chilla, New Ashok Nagar, DND, and Kalindi Kunj, so these routes may see traffic congestion.Apart from the Ghazipur, other borders, namely Singhu, and Tikri, are closed. “The following borders are closed for traffic movement — Piyau Maniyari, Singhu border, Harewali, Mangeshpur and Tikri border,” said a traffic police officer.Traffic police officers also said that Auchandi border is opened only during morning and evening peak hours while Lampur, Safiabad are open.

02-04-2021||Delhi||4th wave swells: Delhi adds 2,790 cases, most in 114 days||Experts called for faster vaccinations and urged authorities to open the drive up for all adults in the Capital, arguing that widespread coronavirus inoculations were the only way to prevent the infection surge from spiralling out of control.The city added 2,790 Covid-19 cases on Thursday, a jump of nearly 1,000 cases more than the previous day’s count.Thursday’s spike was the highest single-day surge in 114 days, since the city recorded 3,188 infections on December 8.“The number of cases has increased more than we anticipated. There is a need to quickly vaccinate as many people as we can — everyone above the age of 18 must be allowed to get doses,” said Dr SK Sarin, director, Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences (ILBS). He headed the Delhi government’s first committee on Covid-19 management and control. The Delhi government had in the third week of March written to the Centre, asking for permission to vaccinate all adults, but hasn’t received approval yet.“All eligible residents should be administered the vaccine quickly. If south Delhi is reporting a high number of cases right now, there will surely be an increase in other districts as well,” said Dr Lalit Kant, former head of the department of epidemiology at the Indian Council of Medical Research.Apart from the sharp spike in cases, the positivity rate — proportion of samples that return positive among total tested — also increased sharply on Thursday, jumping to 3.57% from 2.71% a day ago.Experts regard the positivity rate as a crucial metric to assess the spread of an infection. While Delhi’s positivity rate stayed below 1% for 82 days, it has jumped over the past few days.The number of active cases also crossed the 10,000-mark on Thursday. There were 10,498 people with the infection in the city as on Wednesday night – as reported a day later in Thursday’s health bulletin.The Delhi government on Wednesday ordered 33 major private hospitals to increase the number of Covid-19 beds after occupancy in some facilities crossed 75%.“In my hospital, the Covid wards that had been closed were re-opened. ICUs have started filling up. And, this will continue to increase as the number of cases keeps going up. This is the cycle of Covid-19 that has been seen in other countries as well. People became jubilant as the number of cases went down and the vaccinations started happening, leading to a second wave of cases. In Delhi, it doesn’t seem like a mutant variant is responsible for the current increase. It is the behaviour of people, increase in inter-state and country travel, and over-crowding in public places, get-togethers etc,” said Dr GC Khilnani, former head of the department of pulmonology at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS). He is currently the chairman of PSRI Institute of pulmonary, critical care and sleep medicine.“We have to start worrying about infections in children as well. Younger people are likely to become superspreaders now, with schools and colleges slowly opening up, but none of the vaccines being approved for them,” said Dr Sarin.“Last year, at this time, people were scared of the infection and were minimising activities, taking precautions such as wearing masks and washing hands. But now there is no scare or panic. If you go to the market, it seems as if there is no pandemic. Then there are congregations for festivities and marriages. These lead to the spread of the infection and have to be curtailed, because they are optional activities,” said Dr Khilnani.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/4th-wave-swells-delhi-adds-2-790-cases-most-in-114-days-101617316529450.html
02-04-2021||Chandigarh||2 teachers test positive in Jammu||Authorities in Jammu were sent into a tizzy as two teachers tested positive for the novel coronavirus while the rapid antigen tests of five teachers at Government Girls Higher Secondary School, Satwari, were unclear. As a result, principal Surjit Singh, closed the school, which will be reopened on Monday after thorough sanitisation. Director school education Dr Ravi Shanker Sharma said, “As per reports with me, only one teacher had tested positive, while the result of four others are awaited.” The principal said, “One of our colleagues, who was on leave for five to six days, has tested positive. Therefore, the school was sanitised and other teachers underwent the teat in the school itself. The second teacher to test positive was also on leave. She has isolated herself,” he said. The principal said the uncertain results of five other teachers, who were tested, had added to the confusion and panic. “By then the health team that had conducted the test had returned. The teachers were mistakenly believed to be infected. However, they underwent a test at a private lab where three of them were tested negative while results of two others are awaited,” he said. Jammu district commissioner Anshul Garg has now asked the five teachers to undergo another test on Friday at 10.30am. As the school is an examination centre, it will be sanitised and re-opened. Following the surge, the government of Jammu and Kashmir has started opening schools in a staggered manner. The schools, private and public, have also been seeking indemnity bonds from the parents. However, many parents feel reluctant to send their children to schools. Meenakshi Sharma, the mother of a Class-6 student of an elite school, said, “School authorities are seeking indemnity bond from the parents that says that should any untoward incident happen with the child, the school will not be held responsible. How can a small child take care of herself in school. Given the Covid surge, can’t they continue with e-learning system?” Another parent, Mahesh Kaul also echoed similar views and said that the government should sense the gravity of the situation and should not risk the lives of small children. “How can they expect Covid-apt behavior from small children? Can’t they see spiraling Covid surge,” he asked||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/2-teachers-test-positive-in-jammu-101617311099974.html

With their number close to 8,000 in the state, they say the decision could also have been made applicable for them.Mohini Mahant, 55, who has been working with the District Legal Service Authority (DLSA) and was the first member of the LGBT community to be appointed as a member of bench of Lok Adalat in the past, said, “It is good that the government is providing services for benefit of women. But what about us? We struggled hard and long to get voting rights in 2014. We need to travel, and buses are the only means of transport for many of us,” she said. Mohini holds a master’s degree in public administration. Another transgender Aaina said they face difficulties travelling in buses, as such. “We are ridiculed and not given a seat. We were hoping that there will be something for us when the government announces free bus service for women. We are very disappointed,” she said. Reshma, another transgender, said the coronavirus pandemic had already hit their earnings. “We are not given proper recognition in education, healthcare or jobs. The last year has been difficult, as social events where we performed have been few in number, and have restrictions. A free bus service will benefit us immensely.

It will also hold a rally in May, where its top brass will participate.The party has crafted a strategy to use the humiliation of its Abohar MLA Arun Narang in Malout as its political weapon to not only target the state government, but also to discredit the hardliners’ in farmers’ stir. Farmers had attacked Narang and tore his clothes, when the first-time MLA had gone to Malout to address a press conference against the four-year term of the Congress government. The visuals of Narang being thrashed publicly had evoked a strong response from the party, which had called for Abohar bandh on March 30.“We will take up this issue head-on as the Congress-led state government is openly instigating hardliners to divide the state on communal lines. From tomorrow (Friday), we will be holding rallies at the district level to expose the state government. In May, we are planning to hold a mega rally on this issue,” said Punjab BJP president Sharma, adding that the party high command has taken note of the situation in Punjab. “Senior leaders are in touch with us to ensure workers’ morale remains high,” he added. This issue of low morale among cadre due to the farm protest was discussed at length during a meeting that Sharma had chaired on Wednesday in Jalandhar. The incident forced chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh to not only condemn the incident, but to also direct all SSPs to ensure the safety of BJP leaders Before Malout, party leaders had been at the receiving end with its leaders not being allowed by farmers to come out in public. Senior leaders say, “A sentiment prevails within the party rank and file to leverage this incident to showcase its aggressive political posturing.” Leaders claim that if the BJP did not give a strong response, the cadre will be demoralised, with less than a year left for the assembly polls. There is also a growing perception that the BJP has been losing its traditional base in cities and in areas, where the Hindu community dominates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/abohar-mla-thrashing-bjp-to-launch-rallies-against-state-govt-says-will-go-hard-at-farm-stir-101617309002098.html

Sources said one of the groups had resorted to indiscriminate firing and the woman became a victim, as she stepped out of her house. Devi’s son, Prahlad Kumar, said, “I and my brother Sunny Kumar work as labourers. Four months ago, one Sunny (namesake of his brother) and his uncle Labha had accused my brother of teasing a girl. The case reached the police station where a compromise was reached, as Sunny and his uncle failed to prove their charges. Since then, the accused had been holding a grudge against my brother.”Kumar added, “Two weeks ago, the accused met me in a market and a minor quarrel occurred. On Thursday afternoon, both came into locality, outside our house, and started hurling abuses. When we said we will file a police complaint, the duo fled. Minutes later, the two came back with a mob of 20 unidentified aides. All of them were armed and opened fire.”He said, “We climbed to our rooftop and started pelting stones to disperse the accused. My mother, who was in the house, went out and two of the gunshots hit her. She collapsed and the accused fled. We rushed my mother to a nearby private hospital where she was declared brought dead.”Amritsar Sadar SHO Parveen Kumar said they were yet to record the statement of the victim’s family. “Action will be taken,” he said, adding a that case under Sections 302 (murder) of the IPC and the relevant sections of the Arms Act has been registered against Sunny and some unidentified persons.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/woman-killed-in-group-clash-in-amritsar-101617308520992.html

He ( Sharma) should have joined the campaign,” said Thakur. Shrama had joined the BJP ahead of the assembly elections but was forced to give up his Cabinet berth after the Congress made his son Ashray, the Congress nominee for the Lok Sabha elections . BJP did not include Sharma in any of the poll panels constituted for the elections to Mandi MC. “ I learnt that he (Sharma ) is holding group meetings. God knows for what are the meetings are being convened when the party workers are out in the field,” the CM said. Reiterating that nobody was above the party. Thakur said, “The party had allocated a ticket to Sharma in the assembly elections. I was campaigning in remote villages at the time yet I was told to remain present for his nomination. I followed party directives and did my best to help him during the elections. However, for him his family is always comes first.” Striking an emotional cord with the Mandi electorate, he said, “Elections to the municipal corporation are prestigious not just for me but for the entire district. After all, it is after 70 years that the state has had a CM from Mandi. If you think Jai Ram is resident of Mandi then all of us have to make concerted efforts to ensure the party’s victory in the elections.” Making a fervent appeal to voters, Thakur said, “Congress is misleading people by saying taxes will be levied if rural areas are merged into the corporation. No taxes will be imposed in rural areas.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/rift-within-bjp-widens-as-jai-ram-fires-salvo-at-mandi-mla-anil-sharma-101617308404633.html

As per PAU authorities, the virtual event had witnessed a participation of 2.66 lakh persons from India and abroad.The online mela at the sub-stations of Gurdaspur, Bathinda and Ballowal Saunkhri had received a timid response. One of the online melas held at Bathinda also drew criticism due to low attendance and continuous internet issues.Event could have had political overtonesAs PAU Kisan Mela always attracts political attention, the timing of the offline event was also significant as it was being organised at a time when farmer unions were at loggerheads with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led central government over the three contentious farm laws. It was being anticipated that the mela could have political overtones as there’s less than a year left for the assembly polls.However, without any prior announcement, the farmers were informed about the event being held virtually during the PAU live programme on Thursday.Dr JS Mahal, director of extension education, PAU, said the Kisan Melas were organised twice a year during March and September for Kharif and Rabi seasons. Due to the pandemic, virtual melas are being organised, he said, adding that the two-day event was all set to be held on April 5 and 6.During the mela, videos of field demonstrations, farm machinery and latest agricultural recommendations will be uploaded on the website portal of Kisan Mela. Farmers, farm women and rural youth can participate by logging in on the website, added Mahal.Farmers can also attend the mela on Facebook and YouTube.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/for-second-time-in-row-pau-kisan-mela-to-be-held-virtually-101617308339762.html

It is nothing but an election gimmick. No funds have been allocated in the recent budget for government transport vehicles. Punjab Roadways has 250 buses in 18 depots, while PRTC has a fleet of 1,800, of which around 1,500 buses are run by being hired from a private bus operator who is paid for each kilometre.”He further added that during the time of elections, chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh had vowed to eradicate the private transport mafia, but nothing was done. On the other hand, the government buses were running into losses with each passing day, he said.Due to the protest, the launch of the free bus scheme was delayed by over an hour. Earlier it was stated that cabinet minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu would inaugurate the scheme at 12 noon, but later deputy commissioner Varinder Sharma, along with MLA Surinder Dawar, district Congress committee president Ashwani Sharma and Youth Development Board president Sukhwinder Singh Bindra launched it at 1pm.Confusion prevailed at the ticket counter as many women were seen calling their relatives to the bus stand to handover their Aadhaar cards or driving licences.Puja, 23, who was travelling with a friend, said she was not carrying any identity card: “It was only after reaching here that I learned of the free travel scheme for women, but since I was not carrying an identity proof, I had to pay for the ticket.”Scheme will encourage independenceNeha and Sonia, residents of Doraha and Samrala, respectively, said they were excited about the new government scheme. The scheme will help women immensely in making them independent and also lessen the financial burden the family incurring on their education.“Earlier we used to travel through student passes. Renewing it was a tedious process. Sometimes we used to shell out money to travel through private buses. With government making travelling in government buses free for women anywhere in the state, it has opened abundant opportunities for us,” said the duo, who are NCC cadets.Vina Rani, Nisha, Mamta, Nirmala and Simarjit, who were visiting a shrine at Nakodar, said: “Earlier we used to request our husbands to ferry us because we could not travel by public transport due to financial constraints. Now that travel is free, we have decided to visit each district and town of Punjab.”Demands of protesting unionThe union members want regularisation of contractual staff working for over 12 years; implementation of equal pay for equal work; inclusion of new buses to meet the need of rising population; and proper availability of spare parts at the workshop for timely maintenance of buses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/protests-confusion-in-ludhiana-on-first-day-of-free-bus-scheme-for-women-101617308160351.html

Questioning timing of the ED raids on his properties, the legislator responded to the agency’s affidavit in the high court that ₹4.86 crore was deposited in his bank accounts in 12 years while his declared income was only ₹99 lakh. The agency had also submitted that as money laundering is a standalone offence it can continue with the probe despite the apex court staying criminal proceedings against Khaira. These claims were made by the ED in response to the MLA’s plea against March 9 raids on the properties of Khaira and some people associated with him in connection with a 2015 Fazilka drug smuggling case. Nine persons were convicted in October 2017 in the case with Khaira summoned as “additional accused” through same order, a decision subsequently stayed by the Supreme Court. He alleged the ED was indulging in a political witch-hunt and it chose to launch probe when he was vocally criticising the central government over the farm laws. No cash was recovered in raids and he could explain every transaction made as not a single penny was unaccounted for, he said. He admitted to making some calls to police officers about Gurdev Singh, a convict in the 2015 drug trafficking case as he belonged to his constituency. “If the SC orders are allowed to be violated with impunity, it would spell a death knell for the citizens of this country. .... The court should take a stern view of the matter and deal with all excesses and illegalities committed by the ED,” he added. The matter was adjourned to April 20.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/enforcement-directorate-initiated-probe-into-case-despite-apex-court-s-stay-punjab-mla-khaira-tells-hc-101617307619611.html

Addressed a rally at Ajnala in Amritsar district, his first after recovering from the coronavirus infection, Sukhbir leader also accused Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) national convener Arvind Kejriwal and party’s Punjab chief Bhagwant Mann of playing a double game on the three agricultural laws. “Kejriwal enacted a big drama of opposing the farm laws during the party’s recent meeting in Baghapurana even as his government was the first to implement the legislations in Delhi. Similarly, Bhagwant Mann gave his assent to the amended Essential Commodities Act in a meeting of the standing committee on food and consumer affairs,” he claimed. Later, talking to mediapersons, he said, “Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh is playing a fixed match with the Centre and it is clear from the fact that he had sought time to implement the DBT scheme instead of declining to execute it.”Also, he accused the Centre of teaming up with the AAP government in Delhi as well as the Sarna and GK groups to debar SAD from contesting the Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (DSGMC) elections.Assuring the people that the SAD would continue to safeguard people’s interests, Sukhbir announced SAD would not allow implementation of the three farm laws in Punjab once it forms government in the state.Party leader Bikram Singh Majithia said, “The SAD is the only party which is committed to protect the interests of Panth and Punjab. The Congress is ruining the state under the supervision of Amarinder Singh.”The rally organised former MLA Amarpal Singh Bony whose father Rattan Singh Ajnala along with others had floated the Shiromani Akali Dal (Taksali) in 2019.

Kaur, a senior IAS officer, along with Patiala deputy commissioner Kumar Amit and senior superintendent of police (SSP) Vikram Jeet Duggal visited the university campus and held meetings with the faculty members who recently tendered their resignations from various administrative posts. She also held discussions with representatives of the Punjabi University Teachers’ Association (PUTA) and other unions to end the deadlock. Kaushik, who is from the varsity’s Punjab school of law, had unsuccessfully contested against incumbent PUTA president Nishan Singh Deol in the last elections. The appointments for other top posts such as dean academic affairs, controller of examination, dean colleges and director planning and monitoring are also under consideration, it was learnt. The varsity’s functioning has come to a standstill for over a week after 40 senior faculty members tendered resignations from various posts, accusing the officiating V-C of working in an autocratic manner. They are also miffed over non-clearance of 105 promotion cases. “The new registrar has been appointed on priority basis as the university has to be run. We need to finalise and approve the annual budget to run the institution’s affairs. We cannot afford further deadlock. Meetings are being held to make other top appointments as the names of faculty members are under consideration,” said the officiating V-C. “In the past one week, I have held three meetings with outgoing registrar Devinder Sidhu but he was reluctant to come on board again,” she added. Candlelight march held on campusPUTA and other employee unions on Thursday staged a protest and held a candlelight march on the campus over the decision to appoint the new registrar. “We strongly oppose the appointment of new registrar as the administration has resorted to divide-and-rule ploy. The officials are using pressure tactics to force other teachers to rejoin their administrative posts,” Deol said. “We will intensify our protest in the coming days and won’t allow the varsity administration to work till our demands are met,” he added. The protesters have locked the registrar’s office and stalled the administrative work.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjabi-university-officiating-v-c-appoints-new-registrar-employee-unions-threaten-to-intensify-stir-101617307500678.html

As per information, the girl fell through the emergency exit window. Her mother had gone to the washroom at the time. It was after the mother raised the alarm that other passengers pulled the chain and brought the train to a halt and informed railway officials. After two hours of search, the girl, identified as Mahira Sharma, was found lying in the fields, about six kilometres from where the train halted. She was rushed to the Samrala civil hospital from where she was shifted to a private hospital. Doctors said she has suffered only minor injuries and is in a stable condition. Vaishali Sharma, the girl’s mother, said that she resides in Mumbai and had come to Phagwara with her three children to meet her relatives. On Thursday, the four of them boarded the Paschim Express from Phagwara to reach Mumbai. The seats allotted to them were in the middle of the compartment. Around afternoon, she went to the washroom, leaving the three children on their seats. When she came back, her five-year-old daughter told her that Mahira had fallen off the window. A passenger on the train said that it is nothing less than a miracle that the girl suffered only minor injuries as the train was moving very fast.

Punjab food and civil supplies minister tells HT that the state government is committed to ensuring procurement of every grain. The deadlock between the Punjab government and the Centre continues. Will it cast a shadow on upcoming wheat procurement? You have already deferred it by ten days. We are trying to resolve the deadlock between our government and the Centre. I, however, want to assure you that there will be no impact on procurement this season, and every grain of the farmer will be purchased. Procurement was deferred due to the spike in covid cases. We are ready and have set up at least 3,900 mandis for staggered procurement.How will you resolve the deadlock?We are trying to meet Union food minister Piyush Goyal. The issues are complicated and have to be resolved in a face-to-face meeting. Writing letters will not solve any purpose. The Centre is duty-bound to redress the state’s grievances. The CM is also trying to meet the PM.What are Punjab’s apprehensions in implementing direct payment? It concerns the state’s Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) Act, which mandates an important role for kutcha arhtiyas (commission agents) in our procurement system. If we make direct payment to farmers, we have to amend the APMC Act. Arhtiyas manage entire mandi operations and other logistics related to the crop. In addition to all of this, an Indian state also has federal powers, which need to be respected.Arhtiyas claim there are other issues which need resolution.There are incidental charges that we need to be recover from the Centre.

At many places, social distancing norms were also seen being openly flouted as patrons rushed to secure themselves a stock of their preferred brand of liquor. At some places, liquor vend owners had pulled the shutters down but continued sale through a small holed carved in the shutter.A staffer at one of the vends, requesting anonymity, said, “It would have been a huge revenue loss for us if the vends had been closed at 9pm. People came in large numbers in view of the year-end discounts. The government should also have made exceptions for us in view of the March 31 rush.”Sahil, a customer standing in a queue at a vend on Pakhowal road, said it is the only time of the year when liquor is available at discounted rates so everyone is trying to make the best out of it.Traders slam police inaction against liquor vendsMeanwhile, police inaction against the liquor vend owners did not go down well with the traders who accused the administration of discriminating against them.

02-04-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab’s kitty got ₹30,713-crore GST boost in 2020-21||Punjab received a financial boost from the goods and services tax (GST) during the financial year 2020-21, thanks to the highest-ever compensation and sharp recovery in collections after the Covid-19 pandemic hit the state economy. The cash-strapped state government received ₹30,713 crore from GST, including compensation from the central government, in 2020-21 as against ₹22,099 crore during the previous financial year, according to data compiled by the taxation department. The 39% increase in GST revenue has provided a considerable financial wiggle room to the state government that has less than a year to go for the assembly polls, allowing it to release pending bills and payments and give a push to welfare schemes. 105% JUMP IN GST COMPENSATION FROM CENTRE The indirect tax funds include GST compensation of ₹18,050 crore which is more than double, 105% to be precise, the amount of ₹8,805 crore received by the state government from the central government in financial year 2019-20. The compensation is for shortfall in the state’s monthly protected revenue of ₹2,403 crore last year in addition to some pending claims, a department official said. At the time of switching to GST, the central government had guaranteed 14% year-on-year growth over the revenue base in 2015-16 and agreed to compensate the state for any shortfall. The Centre has borrowed funds to give compensation to the states as tax collections were severely hit due to the Covid-19 pandemic last year. COLLECTIONS POINT TO ECONOMIC RECOVERY The state’s GST revenue signalled a significant pickup in economic activity, nearly matching the revenue in 2019-20 revenue, after the coronavirus-induced lockdown in the first two months of the year gone by. The collections including state GST (SGST) and integrated GST (IGST) settlement stood at ₹12,663 crore in 2020-21, down 4.7% from ₹13,300 in the previous year, which is a considerable improvement from the first half when the mop-up was sluggish. The state’s revenue collection for the April-September period of 2020-21 was down by 31% year-on-year and started picking up as lockdown restrictions were eased gradually. Additional chief secretary, taxation, A Venu Prasad said the GST amount is at a “historic high” as the department pursued GST compensation claims vigorously with the central government and filed claims on time which also helped settlement of some compensation claims of previous years. “Our GST and excise teams carried out strict enforcement and launching crackdowns on those indulging in tax frauds and illicit liquor trade,” he said. DOUBLE-DIGIT GROWTH IN EXCISE, VAT REVENUES The increase in excise and value-added tax revenues also provided relief to the state government. The excise collection jumped by 21% year-on-year, going to ₹6091.21 crore in 2020-21 from ₹5,022.36 crore. Besides release of additional quota that fetched extra ₹450 crore, action against illegal distillers and smugglers under Operation Red Rose also saw collections go up. VAT and central sales tax collections, which mostly come from diesel, petrol and other petroleum productions, swelled by 13%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjabs-kitty-got-30-713-crore-gst-boost-in-202021-101617306779388.html

02-04-2021||Chandigarh||IAS officer Khemka moves HC over strictures passed by court||IAS officer, Ashok Khemka, has approached the Punjab and Haryana high court over strictures passed by the court against him in a case related to appointment of international shooter Vishwajeet Singh as a Haryana Civil Service (HCS) officer. The HC bench of justice Ajay Tewari and justice Rajesh Bhardwaj has issued notice of motion for April 20. In January, a high court judge had decried his role for causing delay in appointment of Vishwajeet as an HCS officer. The appointment of Vishwajeet, son of IAS officer Jagdeep Singh, got delayed on complaint of Khemka in December 2019. The appointment has now been made after HC intervention in January in which court made remarks against Khemka. Khemka demanded that strictures passed against him should be expunged as he was not associated with proceedings before court in any manner. “It is submitted with the greatest respect and in all humility that the impugned strictures are not only absolutely unfounded and perverse but have been passed by the learned single judge in manifest violation of the principles of natural justice and are thus ex facie illegal and liable to be expunged,” Khemka stated. The single judge bench had recorded in its order that the shooter’s appointment got delayed due to an “ill-informed perspective which complainant Ashok Khemka entertained regarding shooting sport.” “Even the questions raised by Khemka in his complaint, reflected his utter ignorance about the sports activity and regarding award of medals in the sport of shooting,” the court recorded. “This was the height of unfounded self-righteousness. This totally takes away the pretense of acting in public interest and shows that Khemka might have used all these tactics to bring the officers under pressure and to bring junior officials of the department under fear psychosis, which forced them to continue the tirade against the petitioner in one form or the other” was another remark the judge had made on Khemka’s role.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ias-officer-khemka-moves-hc-over-strictures-passed-by-court-101617306428212.html

Raj Kumar said the safety of students remains the prime concern for the university.“Given the present situation, the university will continue with online teaching. It is not feasible for us to resume physical teaching for all students. Almost 99% of our online classes are successful,” he added. PU had allowed certain categories of postgraduate final-year students to stay at hostels in February, but later halted the further reopening in the wake of spike in Covid-19 cases. Many students have also boycotted the online classes, seeking resumption of regular classes. Regarding the ongoing protest of students who are demanding the reopening of AC Joshi library, Raj Kumar said that a committee has already been constituted to deliberate on the matter. Research scholars of the university are facing many issues that are affecting their research work. When asked about this, Raj Kumar said, “We are already thinking about it. We are trying to find an alternative within the PU regulations in the interest of our students.”With the senate election of PU pending since last August, the varsity is functioning without its apex governing body. The term of senate had ended on October 31. The annual budget for the 2021-22 financial year recommended by the Board of Finance has not been approved by the senate so far. “The annual budget has been recommended by the BoF which has a member of the ministry of education, Punjab government, and the Chandigarh administration. I do not think that university will face any issue in its implementation,” the V-C said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/panjab-university-will-continue-with-online-teaching-for-now-says-vc-101617306182286.html

The protesting students entered the reading hall as the meeting between them and the varsity officials was not held after both sides differed on how many students will attend the meeting. The research scholars and students have been protesting for the last nine days outside the library demanding its immediate reopening.Last week, the university had closed all the departmental libraries, along with AC Joshi library, in the wake of recent surge in the numbers of Covid-19 positive cases.Continuing the stir, students also marched towards the administrative block of PU on Thursday where they raised slogans against the vice-chancellor, Raj Kumar, and other varsity officials. Raj Kumar also held an emergent meeting with officials in the day regarding the issue after which officials called a meeting with student representatives. The university, in its official communiqué, said, “PU authorities tried to meet the protesting students to continue dialogue with them related to the opening of the library. The authorities asked the students to send five representatives whereas students were insisting on sending nine members for the meeting. The authorities kept on waiting for two hours but no one turned up.”The university also said that there was a protest by students at the administrative block after which they went to the library and broke open the lock of the reading room. “A police complaint has been made in this regard. Thereafter, with the help of the police, the reading room was locked,” the university said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/protesting-pu-students-break-into-reading-hall-101617306181268.html
02-04-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh pollution panel seeks report on garbage dump fire||As the fire at the dumping ground in Dadumajra continued to smoulder on Thursday, the Chandigarh Pollution Control Committee sought a report from the municipal corporation detailing the reasons.The letter to the MC commissioner came after an expert team from the CPCC was constituted and rushed to the spot for inspection.Debendra Dalai, member secretary, CPCC, said: “The committee has asked the corporation to immediately submit a report detailing the reasons for the fire and also submit an accident report.”In case of a fire at the dumping site, the MC is mandated to submit an accident report on its own to the pollution board, as per the Municipal Solid Waste Management Rules.“After the last fire incident, the MC didn’t submit the report. This time, the CPCC has sought the report,” said Dalai.According to MC officials, this is the fourth fire incident at the dumping site in the past one year, with two of these being major ones.On the environmental and health impact of the fire, Dalai said: “Such a fire can have detrimental impact on the air quality with release of toxic gases. The poor air quality results in health issues for people.”The committee in the letter to the MC has also directed it to take immediate steps so that such an incidents are not repeated in future, said Dalai.The fire has engulfed the site of legacy mining from where more than 5 lakh tonne of legacy waste is to be removed. The legacy mining project, worth ₹33 crore, started in December 2019, was to be completed in 18 months. So far, only around 30% of it has been completed.MC commissioner KK Yadav said: “The project deadline was revised in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. Now, the firm has been directed to complete it by December this year. So far 1.5 lakh tonne of legacy waste has been removed.”Fire still simmering, residents complain of issues in breathingAs many as eight fire tenders along with earth-moving equipment have been pressed into service since the fire broke out on Wednesday afternoon. It is still simmering, and every few hours, huge flames can be seen erupting from some parts of the dump.“The operation is still on. The fire had spread towards the processing plant but was brought under control,” said Anil Kumar Garg, chief fire officer. Though the exact cause of the fire is unclear, the authorities pin suspicion on scrap dealers and rag pickers. Garg said: “Methane gas produced in the garbage catches fire very easily. Ragpickers who move around in the area drop bidis and cigarettes that leads to fire.” Scrap dealers burn the plastic coating to extract wires, and that could have led to the fire, said another fire official. Medical officer health Dr Amrit Warring said about 10 earth-moving vehicles have been pressed into service to put sand on the dump.Meanwhile, people residing in nearby areas, including Dadumajra, Sector 25, Sector 38 West, Maloya and Dhanas, had a sleepless night. Many complained of problems in breathing and irritation in eyes. Rohit Sharma, a resident of Sector 38 West, said: “The smell made it difficult to breath.” Satprakash, a shopkeeper in Sector 25, said: “The smoke brought down visibility. We are wearing masks, but they are ineffective in keeping away the smoke and smell.” Dyal Krishan, president, Dadumajra Dumping Site Joint Action Committee, said, “In the past one year, many fires have broken out at the dump. An inquiry is needed into these repeated firing incidents so that corrective measures can be taken.” Meanwhile, even as a thick blanket of smoke covered the area around the dumping ground, air quality index (AQI) at various observatories in the city didn’t show any unusual rise. Debendra Dalai attributed it to fast winds blowing in the city. “While the values of PM 2.5 and PM 10 rose slightly on Thursday afternoon, the overall AQI remained unchanged around 120 at various CPCC observatories. The AQI had stayed below 100 about a week back; so there was only a marginal rise due to the fire,” he said. The continuous ambient air quality monitoring station in Sector 25, situated close to the dumping ground, also didn’t show any spike in AQI on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-pollution-panel-seeks-report-on-garbage-dump-fire-101617306180186.html

Of the total rain in the month gone by, the maximum was recorded at 2.4mm on March 24. This is the driest the city has been since 2018, when 3mm showers were recorded.However, a WD is likely to affect the region in the coming week, and will bring along rain.“Western disturbances remained weak this time and didn’t bring much rain. Temperature also remained high and dry, and cloudless weather was prevalent throughout the month,” said Surender Paul, director, IMD, Chandigarh.Paul added that it could not be determined as yet if the same effect will continue through April. However, due to a WD next week, light rain up to 20mm is likely on Monday and Tuesday.Mercury lowers to 31.1°CMeanwhile, after soaring to 36.5°C on Tuesday, the maximum temperature dropped to 32°C on Wednesday and further to 31.1°C on Thursday. The minimum temperature also decreased from 15.6°C on Wednesday to 14.3°C on Thursday. The drop in temperature over the past couple of days is due to the movement of easterly winds, which cooled down the city, while earlier, warm and dry northerly winds had caused the day temperature to soar past 36°C.But, with the effect of the easterly winds diminishing, the maximum temperature is expected rise up to 33°C in the next three days, while the minimum temperature may also go up to 16°C.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/this-march-in-chandigarh-was-driest-since-2018-101617305821233.html
02-04-2021||Chandigarh||Hold senate polls in 2 months: HC to Panjab University||Criticising the role of vice-chancellor Raj Kumar, the Punjab and Haryana high court has directed Panjab University to hold its senate polls within two months.The order came on the plea of seven former senators, who had moved the high court on December 22, seeking directions to hold governing body polls. The term of the senate, the apex governing body of PU, ended on October 31 and the syndicate’s term got over on December 31. The varsity is without a governing body now. Elections were to take place in August, but the varsity deferred them citing Covid-19 pandemic as the reason.“Little did the enacters of the Panjab University Act, 1947, would have realised that what they have framed as a comprehensive and exhaustive legislation would come to be a tool in the hands of its own academic officer, pursuing not the educational goals but satisfying his own personal ends and thereby in the process virtually oust its own governing body, looking after the management and superintendence of this August institution once of international fame and oldest in this country,” the bench of justice Fatehdeep Singh observed, while questioning the V-C’s role in delaying the elections. The bench further observed that provisions on governance have been thrown “off to the winds” and the university is being run as a “one-man show”. ‘Can’t postpone indefinitely’On the varsity’s argument that the elections were deferred in view of the Covid-19 situation, the court observed that the argument is apparently a way to duck the obligations, at a time when elections are being conducted to various institutions, including state assemblies and local bodies, throughout the country. No doubt the V-C is empowered to postpone the elections for the time being, but this does not clothe him with unbridled powers to carry on indefinitely when throughout the country elections are being held, the bench added. It further recorded that all was not well with the decision of the authorities to defer the polls and it could have been done with “motive and malice”. ‘Decision smacks of caprice’As for the argument that the new education policy is to be implemented and it calls for a re-examination of the governance structure, the court said its implementation is too far-fetched a proposition and till that time regulations on governance, which call for the polls, can’t be put into a “cold freezer.”It further said that for properly running the university and ensuring that the very purpose of its formation is not jeopardised, the election needs to be held at the earliest so that it does not lead to autocratic governance affecting democratic functioning of the institution. “In a democratic system, elections need to be held periodically, which in turn leads to democratic governance and thus are a very essential function in decision making. Besides, it leads to accountability, resulting in better and efficient running/governance of an institution,” the court said, recording that the decision of the varsity “smacks of mala fide, caprice” and is in utter violation of the law governing it. Now, the V-C has been asked to complete the poll process by all means within two months. Reacting to the development, the V-C said the varsity will abide by the directions of the high court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hold-senate-polls-in-2-months-hc-to-panjab-university-101617305819659.html

After seeing the farmers’ numbers increasing, Dushyant took off in a chopper for Chaudhary Charan Singh Haryana Agriculture University (CCHAU) from where he went to the mini-secretariat and inaugurated many developmental projects in the presence of state minister Anoop Dhanak, Hisar deputy commissioner Priyanka Soni, Barwala MLA Jogi Ram Sihag, and Tohana legislator Devinder Singh Babli.Later, the farmers went to Dushyant’s residence and raised slogans against him while carrying black flags.A senior administrative official, seeking anonymity, said the deputy CM attended a wedding at international boxer Pinki Jangra’s home in Hisar and skipped his plan to visit the grain market to inspect wheat procurement.Soni said Dushyant inaugurated a two-lane overbridge on the Rewari-Bathinda railway line, distributed 45 water tankers in different panchayats, etc.Farm leader Vikas Sisar said they will continue to protest against the BJP-JJP leaders until the Centre’s three farm laws are repealed.JJP MLAs put a united showEven as farmers’ anger against Dushyant continued across state, his party MLAs, including Dhanak, Sihag and Babli put up a united show by attending his public programme for the first time since the farmers started agitating.However, Narnaund MLA Ram Kumar Gautam, who is at loggerhead with Dushyant, skipped the programme.Political observer Anant Ram, a retired professor from Bhiwani, said Babli and Sihag have no option than supporting Dushyant after they backed BJP during trust vote.“Both know that the farming community is unhappy with them as they assured the farmers of putting weight behind them in the ongoing stir. After seeing all situations, both the MLAs decided to repose faith in Chautala,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/farmers-protest-haryana-dy-cm-s-visit-to-hisar-101617305759587.html

The agency suspects that the Audi, seized from Vasai, could be the vehicle in which the trader was smothered. NIA sources said the Audi was taken to south Mumbai, where forensic experts thoroughly examined it on Thursday for possible biological and other traces.Hiran was linked to the explosives-laden Scorpio found abandoned near industrialist Mukesh Ambani Antilia home in south Mumbai. He had gone missing late in the evening on March 4 and his body was recovered from a creek at Reti Bunder near Mumbra the next day.Six handkerchiefs were found stuffed in his mouth, and his face was covered by a scarf. The Maharashtra anti-terrorism squad (ATS), which was earlier probing the case, had arrested former constable Vinayak Shinde and cricket bookie Naresh Gor in connection with the murder. ATS suspected that suspended Mumbai Police officer Sachin Vaze – who has been arrested by NIA for his alleged role in the Antilia security scare case – is also the prime accused in Hiran’s murder case, while Shinde allegedly helped him execute the murder, and Gor arranged for some SIM cards used in the commission of the crime from Gujarat.Both ATS and NIA officials believe that Mansukh was smothered in a vehicle at Gaimukh, along Ghodbunder Road.The initial probe by ATS had revealed that Hiran had received a call around 8.29pm on March 4, and the caller spoke to him for around 11 minutes and asked him to meet near Majiwada junction on Ghodbunder Road.According to an ATS officer, the trader was made to sit in a four-wheeler at Majiwada junction, taken 10km away to Gaimukh breach front, and smothered in the vehicle at the spot. Later the body was dumped in the creek at Reti Bunder, suspect NIA officials.NIA is also trying to trace the Maruti Eeco, allegedly stolen from Aurangabad in November. The car’s original number plates were found during a search in Mithi river on March 28.Meanwhile, NIA also raided a Girgaum club, whose owner had introduced Vaze and Shinde to Gor. An NIA team conducted a search for three hours and recorded the statements of the owner, manager and staff. NIA also questioned a woman on Thursday in the connection with the Antilia case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/mansukh-hiran-murder-case-nia-seizes-audi-suspects-trader-was-smothered-in-it-101617305339825.html
02-04-2021||Chandigarh||Central panel flags low contact tracing, vaccination coverage in Chandigarh||A three-member central panel, in city to assist the UT administration with reining in the Covid-19 pandemic, has observed that contact tracing can be strengthened and vaccination coverage must be improved through rigorous information and educational activities. The team is led by Vijoy Kumar Singh, additional secretary and financial adviser, Union ministry of textiles, with experts drawn from Dr Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital, New Delhi, and Safdarjung Hospital, New Delhi.The panel on Thursday held a two-hour meeting with officials of the health department and Chandigarh administration, and doctors from the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) at the UT Guest House here. Stating that the system developed by the authorities in Chandigarh was better than most places in the country, Vijoy said there was still a scope for improvement. “In the contact-tracing exercise, the number of contacts currently stands at 13-15 persons. This can be improved to 20-25 persons,” said Vijoy, the chairman of the panel.On the vaccination drive front, the panel took note of low response by health and frontline workers.Even after over two months since the vaccination drive’s rollout on January 16, the coverage among healthcare staff and frontline workers was quite less, as compared to other states. Similarly, among the senior citizens, only 32,154 people had received the first dose through March.“The vaccination coverage among the priority group of senior citizens has been less, and even if we assume that there are around 3 lakh senior citizens in the country, the coverage in one month is not encouraging,” said Arun Gupta, UT health secretary.The panel also suggested that UT should conduct a sero-survey to know the extent of infection spread in the city, officials part of the meeting said. Taking note of its steadily rising cases, the Union health ministry on Wednesday had asked Chandigarh to step up its test-track-treat strategy against the Covid-19 pandemic.History of lapsesA team of experts, deputed by the central government in early September, had found that as the Covid-19 pandemic surged in Chandigarh in September last year, the administration was not able to get in touch with those testing positive within 24 hours of samples testing positive, which further delayed contact tracing.The month saw a major surge in infections, with the highest single-day cases (449) being recorded on September 13, while the highest number of active cases (3,171) was reported on September 16.After September’s 7,595 cases, the highest so far, March has the second-most infections at 5,229.‘Make test results available sooner’Second Innings Association, a civil society group, in a representation to the panel suggested that Covid-19 test results should be made available in the minimum possible time, so that the affected people can be isolated at the earliest. “Presently, test results are received quite late, which delays the contact tracing exercise,” the association said. Emphasis should also be on taking strict action against those violating Covid norms and testing capacity should be enhanced at government institutes, it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/central-panel-flags-low-contact-tracing-vaccination-coverage-in-chandigarh-101617305279545.html
02-04-2021||Mumbai||Most cases, tests in Mumbai in March: Mayor warns of curbs on train travel, malls||Mayor Kishori Pednekar on Thursday hinted at strict restrictions, including shutting of malls, religious places and restrictions on travel in local trains, as the city reported its highest every cases – 8,646 – since the outbreak of Covid-19 on Thursday, along with 18 deaths. The authorities have started testing aggressively since the past one week, taking the city’s tally between March 1 and 31 to 838,500 tests. This is the highest number of testing conducted in the city ever since the outbreak of the pandemic. March also reported the highest – over 80,000 cases – in one single month, followed by around 211 deaths in the city, according to the state health department data. Pednekar, while speaking to reporters on Wednesday, said, “There are enough beds to handle the increasing number of cases, but we have to act wisely before the city enters the danger zone. The new restrictions that might be announced will have malls and religious places completely shut, followed by shops that might be allowed to open on alternate days. We might also allow local trains to be only used by essential workers owing to the increasing cases.” However, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has maintained they have not decided about the lockdown yet. Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner, said, “We have not received any directions on lockdown. There is no such directive or announcement yet.” The BMC officials claimed a final decision on restrictions might only be taken by weekend, after chief minister Uddhav Thackeray takes a review meeting on Covid-19 situation. According to BMC officials, as the tests have almost doubled, the detection has also increased and the variations in mutants have added to the case tally. The mortality rate has, however, remained under control. Mumbai reported around 211 deaths in March 2021, whereas in September and October, when Mumbai was at its peak, it reported around 2,500 deaths with around 0.1 million cases. Since February 3, 2020, Mumbai has tested 4.1 million tests and the positivity rate is around 10.04%, according to BMC’s data. March 2021 saw the highest spike in testing, when 838,500 tests were conducted, much higher than compared to the tests conducted during the peak in Mumbai. In September and October, when Mumbai was at its peak, the city tested around 0.7 million samples cumulatively. According to BMC officials, the testing has increased in the city as the authorities have started random testing at malls, markets and other crowded places. Municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal had last week said, “We aim to test around 60,000 samples daily, which is around 50,000 right now, and with this, the daily caseload might also go up to 10,000 on a daily basis. However, this might not result in shortage of beds.” As of Thursday, the city has recorded 423,419 cases and 11,708 deaths. The city’s recovery rate is 84% with 355,944 recoveries, followed by the city’s mortality rate is 2.76. There are 54,807 active cases in the city. Meanwhile, the BMC in a statement said that it has issued revised guidelines for home isolation of Covid-19 patients. In the guidelines, the BMC has listed out specific warning signs to be looked for immediate hospital transfer of patients under home isolation. The BMC has also asked its officers to ensure that home isolated patients monitor their health and take treatment for Covid-19 from their family physician and continue comorbidity treatment. Some of the warning signs that would need admission include difficulty in breathing, oxygen saturation < 95% using fingertip pulse oximeter, persistent fever of 100.4 for more than 24 hours, persistent pain, pressure in the chest or cough, hypoxic on mild exertion like six-minute walk test, climbing 1 or 2 flight of stairs, mental confusion or inability to arouse, slurred speech, seizures, weakness or numbness in any limb or face, bluish discoloration of lips, face, any other new onset organ dysfunction, like hypotension, drowsiness, kidney dysfunction.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/most-cases-tests-in-mumbai-in-march-mayor-warns-of-curbs-on-train-travel-malls-101617304558780.html

The toll surged to 4630 after 11 more deaths were reported. The spike in Bengaluru took the number of infections in Karnataka beyond the 4000 mark for a second day in a row. Karnataka recorded 4234 new Covid cases on Wednesday thereby taking its active case count to 30865. The death toll climbed to 12585 as 18 more people succumbed to the virus. The surge in cases has prompted the government to declare that the state is reeling from a second wave.The infections since the beginning of March have seen a sharp spike, sparking fears that Bengaluru could relapse into a phase it had seen in September and October last year when it started to record an average case count of over 3000 and a high of over 5000 per day. The BS Yediyurappa-led government has even been accused of not taking the recommendations of the technical advisory committee or officials from announcing stricter measures to contain the spread. Former BBMP commissioner Manjunath Prasad on Wednesday said that their proposal to make negative RT-PCR Covid test reports mandatory for passengers entering Bengaluru from all states was not approved by the government. The state government has ruled out another lockdown that could further cripple the already fledgling economy and cash crunch in the state, experts and political leaders said. Not only Bengaluru, the situation in other districts in the state has deteriorated as well, data shows. The border district of Bidar registered 208 new cases while Kalaburagi, Mysuru and Tumakuru reported 144, 109 and 102 cases respectively on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bluru-adds-over-2k-cases-k-taka-s-tally-crosses-1mn-101617304499379.html
02-04-2021||Mumbai||‘80% of ICU beds occupied in Mumbai, need more to fight 2nd wave’||With the number of active Covid-19 patients crossing 51,000, almost 80% of the intensive care unit (ICU) beds are occupied by severely infected patients. Although the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) plans to increase the bed strength to 21,000 from the current 13,000, doctors claim the civic body should focus more on ICU beds. Currently, there are a total of 1,627 ICU beds in hospitals, of which only 324 beds are vacant. It includes 155 vacant beds in civic-run hospitals, while the remaining 169 unoccupied beds are in private hospitals. Similarly, of the 1,000 ventilator beds, only 170 beds are vacant with 81 beds in private and 89 beds in BMC-run hospitals. Mumbai is recording between 5,000-6,000 cases daily, of which 10-15% need hospitalisation. With around 700 patients needing hospitalisation for a period of 14 days, soon, the remaining vacant beds are likely to get filled. Naresh Mehra, 71, a resident of Andheri, was diagnosed with Covid-19 on Wednesday, along with his 45-year-old son. His oxygen saturation dropped below 90% and considering he has diabetes, his family physician suggested he be admitted to the ICU. But even after approaching two-three hospitals, they couldn’t find a bed. “We enquired at private hospitals, including Holy Spirit and Apex Hospital in Andheri. Then we scouted for beds in Thunga Hospital in Malad, but didn’t get an ICU bed. Later, through BMC, we admitted him at Dahisar jumbo centre,” said Sukanya Mehra, daughter-in-law of the patient. “Many hospitals are complaining of shortage of ICU beds. So, on priority, the civic body should increase the ICU beds to provide timely treatment to patients who have been severely infected,” said Dr Amit Thadani, a general surgeon in Chembur who is currently in-charge of Covid care at a private hospital. Major private hospitals like Lilavati, Nanavati, Saifee, Bombay hospitals, among others, have run out of ICU beds who keep patients on waiting lists. “The flow of patients has increased. As soon as a patient gets discharged from the ICU, we admit another one. So, we don’t have any vacant bed at the moment,” said Dr V Ravishankar, chief operating officer, Lilavati Hospital. Due to the growing fear, many mildly symptomatic patients who can be treated at home are also requesting for beds. To address the issue, the BMC has issued a circular instructing private hospitals to admit patients only through the respective civic war rooms. “There is a growing fear among people due to the second wave and misinformation about the mutation of the virus. Mildly symptomatic patients also want to get admitted. Some even provide incorrect information about symptoms to get a bed,” said Dr Gautam Bhansali, in-charge of covid beds in private hospitals. City hospitals are also struggling with manpower crunch. Compared to last year, the workload is more this year due to the second wave and rising footfall of non-Covid patients. “Last year, when the pandemic started, due to the lockdown, the footfall of non-Covid patients fell by almost 90%. But now, with the starting of public transport, we are getting a large number of non-Covid patients. So, the workload has doubled, which is too much to handle,” said a senior doctor from BYL Nair Hospital. With the flattening of the pandemic curve post October 2020, many hospitals have reduced their Covid bed strength to make space for non-Covid patients. Now, they are struggling to make arrangements for it. “When the pandemic started, we had more than 150 Covid beds. But with the drop in daily cases, we reduced the bed strength to 15. Now again, we are increasing Covid beds in the hospitals. At present, we have 39 beds, including 11 ICU beds. Soon, we would add another 40 beds,” said Dr Bhansali.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/80-of-icu-beds-occupied-in-mumbai-need-more-to-fight-2nd-wave-101617304499930.html

The incident took place on Wednesday morning and the two victims -- Abdul Rahim and Musthafa have been hospitalised. According to officials of Dakshin Kannada police headquarters, the attack took place when the two men were returning home in a pick-up truck after repairing the vehicle at a garage in Belthangady. The men had gone to visit Rahim’s relative near Belthangady when their vehicle broke down and they had given it for repair on Tuesday. “Around 10 am, when the two men reached Melanthabettu village, two men on a motorcycle waylaid them. They questioned where they were going and as per the victims, the two men started attacking them,” said a police official. Soon, few more men joined the duo. “They damaged the vehicle claiming the two men were transporting cattle. They attacked them using clubs and hit them with slippers as well. Our officials were informed about the attack and we rescued them,” police added.

02-04-2021||Mumbai||37,563 aged 45-59 vaccinated in Mumbai||As the city started to vaccinate all citizens in aged 45-59, irrespective of their comorbidities, on Thursday, the turnout of beneficiaries in this age group increased drastically compared to the figures so far. On Thursday, Mumbai vaccinated 37,563 beneficiaries in this age group, of which 270 beneficiaries received their second dose, in comparison to the earlier average of 5000-6000 beneficiaries from this age group in the past week. The average turnout was even lower in the beginning of March. On March 31, 4,896 beneficiaries in the 45-59 age group were vaccinated; on March 30, 4,792 and 3,023 on March 29. Effectively, the overall number of beneficiaries vaccinated increased on Thursday increased to 55,870 across 116 centres, in comparison to the average of 40,000 to 45,000 beneficiaries vaccinated per day in the past few weeks. Of the 55,870, 3,050 received their second dose; 10,203 senior citizens received their first dose, and 373 senior citizens received their second dose; 3,556 frontline workers received their first dose, and 1,867 frontline workers received their second dose; 1,768 healthcare workers received their first dose, and 540 healthcare workers received their second dose. 12 beneficiaries reported minor side effects after receiving their shots. In the first week of March, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation began vaccinating senior citizens and citizens between the age of 45-59 with comorbidities. Overall, 4,000,000 Mumbaiites are above the age of 45 years, 2,300,000 are senior citizens, and 300,000 are citizens between the age of 45 and 59 with comorbidities, as per data collected by the civic body during the My Family, My Responsibility drive. Until Wednesday, 102,475 citizens between the age of 45 and 59 years were vaccinated. This figure shot up to 139,768 on Thursday. Many vaccination centres saw crowds. At Dahisar jumbo vaccination centre, the crowd was a mix of senior citizens and those above 45 years. Among them, many were above the age of 45 and wanted to rush to get vaccinated on the first day itself. Vimal Patel, 45, Dahisar resident, said, “I do a lot of field work for sales, and hence I was waiting to get myself vaccinated.” Rakesh Srivastava, 47, an advertising professional from Kandivli, said, “I have been taking medicines for blood pressure, but I did not have any doctor’s certificate, and hence my vaccination got delayed. The process was very smooth.” Four vaccination centres in the city – Nair Hospital, Rajawadi Hospital, KEM Hospital, and the jumbo facility at Bandra-Kurla Complex (BKC) – are now working in two shifts to accommodate the increased load. Mohan Kataria, 67, who came to KEM hospital in Parel, said, “It was smooth once we entered the vaccination centre, but the registration process took a lot of time.” Meenal Chavan, 48, who came with her husband Manohar to KEM hospital, said, “We don’t have any comorbidities. There are other senior citizens in my family, but they will decide on taking the shot based on our experience.” So far, Mumbai has vaccinated a total of 1,054,825 beneficiaries with their first dose, and 154,172 beneficiaries with their second dose.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/37563-aged-45-59-vaccinated-in-mumbai-101617304439331.html
02-04-2021||Mumbai||NCP men in Maharashtra home dept and their tryst with controversy||In the recent past, there were at least four occasions when the Maharashtra home minister and home department were under severe criticism for allegations of corruption or mishandling. Significantly, every time such allegations were made, the department happened to be headed by a Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) minister. Over the past two decades, two home ministers had to resign over controversies while the third one, incumbent home minister Anil Deshmukh, is on the verge of losing his portfolio after narrowly surviving the opposition’s onslaught over the allegations made by IPS officer Param Bir Singh. A probe panel headed by a retired high court judge KU Chandiwal will now probe allegations against Deshmukh. During the formation of the Congress and NCP government in 1999, the latter was insistent on the home department along with finance. The party believed that finance department helps keeping financial control, while the other empowers in social control with the help of police administration. Barring the five years of the previous government led by Devendra Fadnavis during 2014-19, the NCP handled the home department for more than 16 years, and its four senior leaders were appointed as home ministers. Past incidents One of Deshmukh’s predecessors, Chhagan Bhujbal, also faced allegations of corruption in transfers but none of the charges against him were proven. Bhujbal had to resign from the post in the wake of the multi-crore stamp paper scam, also known as Telgi scam, in December 2003. Though the resignation was taken following an attack on a Marathi TV channel’s office in central Mumbai for satirical depiction of the home minister’s involvement in the scam, it is believed to be just a trigger. Bhujbal’s four-year tenure saw many controversies including Telgi scam, arrest of Shiv Sena founder Bal Thackeray and the allegations of corruption levelled by then opposition leader in the Assembly Narayan Rane who was in Shiv Sena then. A group of NCP workers had attacked the office of Alpha Marathi, belonging to the Zee group, after the channel aired a satire on Bhujbal’s alleged role in the multi-crore stamp paper scam. NCP chief Sharad Pawar had said that Bhujbal offered to resign on moral grounds after the attack. “Everyone knows that the resignation was taken after a lot of controversy over the scam. It had dented the party and the government’s image when the Assembly elections were just a few months away,” said a senior Congress leader. RR Patil was another home minister from the NCP to resign in December 2008, just a few days after the 26/11 terror attack on Mumbai. The resignation came after his remarks kicked up a controversy. He had said, “Bade Sharon mein chhoti bate hoti rehti hai. (Small things do happen in a big city).” He was speaking in the context of alleged intelligence failure. Later he clarified that he meant that it was difficult to keep tabs on each and every movement in a big city but he was misquoted. The remarks led to controversy and Patil had to resign. Many in NCP maintain that Patil was made to resign by Pawar to diffuse the anger among the people that government had failed to protect them from the terrorists. Patil, one of the longest serving home ministers (from December 2003 to December 2008 and October 2009 to September 2014), was made the home minister within a year of his resignation after the Assembly polls. “He was not sacked on the allegations of the corruption, but for his failure to handle the situation post the terror attack which was unprecedented. His statement was just a reason. In fact, in the backdrop of today’s mess, Patil is perceived to be a successful home minister. He was not a taskmaster as political boss, but his clean image helped him gaining respect in the police force,” said an official from the home department. Soon after RR Patil had resigned in 2008, his senior party colleague Jayant Patil was made home minister for about ten months. Leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis too held the portfolio for five years from 2014 to 2019 when he was at the helm as chief minister. Fadnavis and Patil handled the department without much of the controversies. Way back, during the first Shiv Sena-BJP government during 1995-99, home minister Gopinath Munde’s term too had been controversial. “The breed of ‘encounter specialist officers’ in the police force had shot to fame after police started cracking down on gang war in the city. The free hand given to these encounter specialists was questioned as some of them were believably involved into extortion as well as illegal activities related to real estate and some other businesses. Transfers in key postings too had been the subject of murmuring in the police force then,” said another NCP minister. Former Mumbai Police commissioner MN Singh said the home department is very sensitive and needs to be handled by the home minister sensitively. “The minister should never break the chain of hierarchy as it leads to the breaking the discipline, which is the very key in the uniformed service. Whenever the ministers tried meddling with it, they had to pay the price. The political interference in police transfers and postings is badly affecting the efficiency and credibility of the police force. The current episode of the allegations against the home minister has greatly ruined the image of the Mumbai Police and the state government. People’s confidence in the police has shaken. When we say that the politicians should understand this, the police officers at the commanding positions too should have the courage to safeguard their powers and bring it to the notice of politicians,” he said. Current state of affairs Leaders from the ruling Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) believe that Deshmukh failed to gain command over the police force and indulged in too many announcements. A senior NCP leader said that Deshmukh announced a probe in phone tapping during Fadnavis government’s rule as well as a special investigation team to probe Bhima-Koregaon violence, but nothing happened. “Deshmukh was never known for his administrative skills in the departments he handled in previous government. His choice as home minister surprised many, even in the NCP. Maintaining law and order and social peace in Mumbai is very important while handling home department. The home minister appears to have failed in command over Mumbai Police commissionerate and its vital crime branch, leading to the mess the police force is going through right now,” the leader said. The leader added that the home department, under Deshmukh, failed to pre-empt the challenges in cases like Antilia explosives scare, Sushant Singh Rajput’s death, Pooja Chavan’s suicide cases. “The opposition could damage the state government in SSR death case by handing it over to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and registering a case in Patna, because the home department failed in the proper strategy. In Antilia and Mansukh Hiran case, the home department could not even face the opposition properly on the floor of the Assembly. Home minister’s response time was poor,” said the minister. Why the portfolio is so ‘lucrative’ While in the government, the NCP always ensured that the home department remains with it. The party believes that by holding the department, it gets leverage in state politics. Many a times transfers of local officers are done as per the convenience of the party in control, and thus the party has power over local administration. The ruling party leaders also believe police administration plays a key role in elections at local level, making the portfolio important. “Transfers and promotions of police officers are directly controlled by the home minister and it gives him enormous power. The home department is assumed to be very important in keeping control in Mumbai, Bollywood and industries. Allegations of monetary considerations for transfers of police officers are not new for the department. The menace is believed to be prevailing in the police force,” said political analyst Hemant Desai. Political implications The controversy embroiling the home minister has led to rifts within the ruling parties. Congress leaders, in their meeting of senior leaders last week, expressed their dismay over the beating the MVA government was facing because of the NCP. The leaders said that be it their government between 1999 and 2014 or the incumbent three-party government in the state, the alliance faced embarrassment because of the controversies related to the departments handled by the NCP. Deshmukh, during his meeting with party chief Sharad Pawar, believably complained about interference by Sena leadership in his department. He reportedly said that a Sena minister would take meetings with key officers, bypassing him. In turn, Sena leaders pointed at transfers of a few deputy commissioners of police in Mumbai by Deshmukh without taking permission from chief minister Uddhav Thackeray last year. Fadnavis, leader of opposition and former home and chief minister, said, “Home department is a very delicate area. One has to be always careful in dealing with the force. Minimum interference in positing and discipline related to the hierarchy are the keys. If postings are done for some considerations, it is bound to create mess. It is a disciplined force, and the home minister has to maintain the discipline and follow the sanctity of the hierarchy. If the juniors are dealt directly, they tend to undermine their senior officers. It is not minister’s private force but it is for maintaining law and order in the interest of general public.” Former minister of state for home and senior Congress leader Manikrao Thakre said the home department should always remain with the chief minister. “When I was minister of state for home, Sharad Pawar was chief minister with home department with him in 1993. He used to tell me that there should not be interference in the police department. The home department is the face of the government, and its administrative image is largely dependent on the law and order in the state. I think the political interference in the force increased in later years. To avoid it, the department should always remain with the chief minister,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/ncp-men-in-maharashtra-home-dept-and-their-tryst-with-controversy-101617304380213.html
02-04-2021||Mumbai||Demand for plasma soars again amid Covid wave||Amid the second wave, the demand for convalescent plasma therapy, often termed as debatable, for treatment of symptomatic patients has increased. However, the demand is much higher than the supply, leading to harassment of patients’ relatives, claim insiders. Convalescent plasma is an experimental treatment where antibodies from the blood of patients who have recovered from the coronavirus are given to those battling the virus. It is believed that it helps produce an immune response to Sars-Cov-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) conducted a trial called PLACID, involving 464 Covid patients in 39 hospitals across the country. Following which, the council declared the plasma therapy didn’t help in reducing mortality or progression to a severe case. It is the largest convalescent plasma therapy trial in the world to be completed. Although this had initially discouraged doctors from treating Covid-19 infected patients with convalescent plasma, with the start of the second wave, they believe, it would contribute to faster recovery of infected patients. “Plasma therapy is effective for moderate to severely ill patients. For the treatment to be effective on patients, the selection of candidates and timing plays an important role. If the therapy is given to patients (moderate to severe) within the first three days, the mortality rate reduces to 8.5%. But if it is delayed, the mortality rate can be around 11.5%,” said Dr Farah Ingale, director, internal medicine, Fortis Hiranandani Hospital Vashi, where almost 15% rise in demand has been observed. Talking about ICMR’s clinical trial, a senior doctor who is associated with the state Covid task force refuting the findings: “During the clinical trial, the researchers did not check antibody levels of the donors. In fact, most of the donors were asymptomatic patients.” Since the start of the pandemic, doctors in Mumbai have treated over 4lakh Covid-19 infected patients. So public health experts believe doctors have gained enough expertise to decide the treatment protocol for patients. “Firstly, as this is a new virus, we still don’t have a specific medicine for its treatment. It is a trial-and-error process for doctors across the globe. So, after over a year of treatment, these doctors have the expertise to decide if a patient needs plasma therapy or not. Some decision has to be left to doctors,” said Dr Subhas Salunke, state advisor for Covid-19 treatment. Dr Sujit Chatterjee, chief executive officer of LH Hiranandani Hospital, Powai, said plasma therapy can’t solely be attributed to the treatment of patients. “At our hospital, we have found that the early induction of convalescent plasma in moderately severe cases, in combination with Remdesivir and anticoagulants, showed very good results,” he said. But finding a donor has turned into an uphill task, as only 1% of the total 3.5lakh recovered patients in the city have donated plasma. Subhas Nandi, 28-year-old from Dahisar, has been helping people in arranging for plasma donors since last year. Post-October, when the pandemic curve flattened, he was getting one-two queries about donors. But last month, when the city witnessed over 300% rise in active Covid-19 patients, on a daily basis, he has started to get 20 calls seeking help for plasma donors. “Unlike last year, the number of donors has decreased. People aren’t so enthusiastic to donate plasma to help other patients. Also, due to vaccination, many interested public don’t get qualified as after a jab, they can’t donate their plasma. Somedays, it takes us four-five days to arrange for a donor,” he said. Dr Ingale said a person can donate plasma twice a week with a gap of 48hours. However, the doctor needs to identify the patient wisely for donation. “The donor’s antibody levels should be good. Also, probable donors shouldn’t have any Covid-like symptoms for at least four weeks. They should test negative for RT-PCR for at least two weeks in advance and be free from any infection or comorbidities,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/demand-for-plasma-soars-again-amid-covid-wave-101617304378815.html

The court also applauded the police’s speedy investigation and the subsequent trial, and said that it was an ideal case of delivering speedy justice. A single-judge bench of justice Revati Mohite-Dere was hearing the appeal filed by Jitendra Mazi from Bihar, who was convicted for kidnapping and raping a seven-year-old in September 2015. According to the complaint lodged by the girl’s parents on the intervening night of September 30 and October 1, 2015, the appellant had kidnapped the survivor from Sindhudurgnagari station, where they were sleeping after missing their train. The complaint stated that the appellant took the minor to a forest area and sexually assaulted her. After she returned to the platform, she informed her parents about the incident, following which the station master was alerted. Mazi was later arrested, and the special Pocso court convicted and sentenced him to 12 years’ rigorous imprisonment. The court was informed by advocate Nasreen Khalique that her client was falsely implicated in the case at the instance of his employer. Mazi, who worked as the driver of a railway contractor, claimed that his employer had not paid him for three months, as a result of which there was a fight between them, and he was removed from the job. Khalique argued that the prosecution had failed to establish the identity of her client as being the perpetrator and also challenged the DNA report which showed that the blood found on Mazi’s clothes was that of the minor. Additional public prosecutor PH Gaikwad-Patil opposed the plea. After hearing the submissions, justice Mohite-Dere held, “I am of the opinion that no interference is warranted in the impugned judgment and order of conviction and sentence passed by the learned special judge.” HC, while appreciating the speedy investigation and trial, observed, “If cases are investigated with diligence, alacrity and promptness – in the manner as aforesaid – and trial conducted in the manner, in which it has, the perpetrators of crime can be brought to book at the earliest. Probably, this case can be used as an `ideal case’, by the police, on how an investigation can be done.” The judge also warned special courts from falling prey to the slow-motion syndrome, which is lethal to the administration of justice regardless of the ultimate outcome. The court then directed the District Legal Services Authority (DLSA) to compensate the survivor within six months and rejected Mazi’s appeal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/hc-lauds-speedy-trial-in-pocso-case-rejects-convict-s-appeal-101617304318843.html

02-04-2021||Mumbai||MU colleges gear up for another semester exam online, get new online exam providers||A week after the University of Mumbai (MU) announced that the upcoming semester exam too will be conducted in the online mode, colleges are slowly gearing up for the same.“We have dropped Google forms and instead, the exam will be conducted using another software this semester. Proctoring will not only be conducted by the software. Our teachers too will be monitoring exams through the day,” said Neha Jagtani, principal of RD National College, Bandra. She added that the college has decided to set up a war room, where teachers will be monitoring students on various screens while the exam is conducted. “Over and above monitoring, the war room will also act as a helpline for students if they face trouble during the exam,” added Jagtani.Once again, MU has asked colleges to conduct exams in multiple choice questions (MCQ) format and avoid descriptive questions. This decision has not gone down well with colleges. “Since the exam will be in MCQ format, we will continue to shuffle the question numbers and the answers in order to avoid any form of malpractices. We will be stricter with the proctoring process as well,” said Ashok Wadia, principal of Jai Hind College, Churchgate.In a circular issued last week, Vinod Patil, director of board of examination and evaluations, MU, said that summer semester exams will be conducted online using the same guidelines issued earlier for the winter semester exams held last year.The exams for semester 1 to 4 for both regular and repeater students will be held between April 15 and May 5. Semester 6 exams for regular and repeater students will be conducted from May 6 to 21 while semester 5 repeater exams will be held from May 24 to June 2. A separate circular will be issued to announce the dates of the remaining exams.All theory exams are to be conducted online. For degree and post-graduate exams of traditional students (arts, commerce and science), an online test will be held consisting 50 MCQs for 50 marks and the students will be given one hour to complete the same. For vocational courses, an online theory test for a total of 80 marks will be conducted of which 40 marks will be for MCQs and the rest will be for descriptive answers. For inter-disciplinary courses, exams will be held for 60 marks of which 30 will be for MCQ and 30 for descriptive questions. While institutes are trying newer ways to enhance the online examination system, some are worried that proctoring software will not work for larger batches, especially in aided courses. “There are 300 students in our third-year BCom batch, and switching on the camera for all of them for proctoring purposes is impossible because most students don’t have that kind of internet bandwidth. We also need to think about students appearing for their exams from their hometowns where internet will be slow, so video proctoring might be a task,” said Marie Fernandes, principal of St Andrew’s College, Bandra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mu-colleges-gear-up-for-another-semester-exam-online-get-new-online-exam-providers-101617304259391.html

The agency had made Mehta and Maiank accused in the case and sought to issue non-bailable warrants against the two.ED, in its charge sheet, claimed Mehta was an active participant in the generation of proceeds of crime and the process of money laundering. It further claimed that Mehta was a director in Dubai and Hongkong-based companies which received funds obtained through letters of understandings issued by PNB in favour of Modi’s firms.Mehta has, however, maintained that she had no knowledge of the transactions. In a response filed before the designated court which is hearing ED’s plea for confiscation of Modi’s properties, she claimed she had nothing to do with the alleged proceeds of crime.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/pmla-court-keeps-warrants-against-nirav-modi-s-sister-her-husband-in-abeyance-101617304259909.html

In a strongly-worded letter to governor Vajubai Vala on Wednesday, Eshwarappa had said that the chief minister had indiscriminately sanctioned funds to various MLAs and other persons in violation of rules. In his statement on Thursday, Siddaramaiah said that Eshwarappa, who belongs to Yediyurappa’s home district of Shivamogga, had provided evidence of corruption and his allegations had shown a collapse of the administration. “Eshwarappa has provided evidence for the allegations of corruption, nepotism and illegalities against the BJP that I have been making as the leader of opposition. He should not bow down to any pressure and stick to his statement,” the former chief minister said. The Congress leader also referred to the Karnataka high court’s Wednesday order, allowing a probe against the chief minister in a 2019 corruption case wherein he allegedly tried to lure a Janata Dal (Secular) MLA to the BJP by offering him money.Yediyurappa is alleged to have lured opposition legislators, in an exercise termed ‘Operation Kamala’, with the promise of giving them plum portfolios and other monetary rewards. At least 17 legislators from the JD(S) - Congress coalition had defected and helped Yediyurappa come to power after weeks and months of high drama in the southern state.“This proves our allegation that the BJP government in the state is an illicit child from an immoral act called ‘Operation Kamala’,” Siddaramaiah said.The developments come at a time when Yediyurappa already finds himself in a corner over the recent sexual harassment case involving former minister Ramesh Jarkiholi, non-performance of his two-year-old government, cash crunch and growing calls for his removal among other problems.The three bypolls on April 17 have presented the 78-year-old with an opportunity to silence growing dissent and consolidate his position for the remainder of the two years in power.However, at least four Cabinet ministers extended their support to the chief minister on Thursday. “The chief minister has allocated RDPR funds to the MLAs and it is an administrative issue. Since Eshwarappa heads the department and is unhappy over this, it has to be resolved among ourselves,” Karnataka home, law and parliamentary affairs minister Basavaraj Bommai said. Another minister claimed the matter could have been resolved through discussion. “If he (Eshwarappa) had any problems with the decisions taken by the chief minister… I think it could have been resolved within five minutes through a discussion. This situation has caused some sort of embarrassment to the government and the party,” state health & family welfare and medical education minister K Sudhakar said. Political analysts believe that the inaction against BJP MLA Basanagouda Patil (Yatnal), who had earlier sought the removal of the chief minister, and Eshwarappa’s letter were an indication of how the central leadership of the party allowed these attacks against Yediyurappa. “We do not know if there is Centre’s sanction but there are some invisible hands operating. Yatnal and Eshwarappa are only mouths and the hands operating them are unseen,” A Narayana, political analyst and faculty at the Azim Premji University, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ktaka-minister-s-letter-fans-new-political-row-101617304258767.html
02-04-2021||Mumbai||Grant flexibility in bonus mark criteria, request students||Students from Maharashtra who are set to write their Class 10 (SSC) exams this year have requested the state education department to grant them flexibility in allowing bonus marks for the exam.Students said that with a lot of cultural and sporting events not taking place all of last year , the department needs to consider achievements in various areas in the past for granting bonus marks. “For instance, even the drawing grade exam did not take place last year. The department should allow students to produce documents of participation in events and exams before 2020 and should consider such letters for awarding bonus marks too,” said a student from a suburban school.In 2017, the state education department had, for the first time, decided to grant additional marks up to 25 to students for excelling in areas in addition to sports. It announced bonus marks for arts and cultural activities. In 2018, after scores of students soared high with bonus marks, the department amended the rules and reduced the maximum bonus scores to 15 marks. For intermediate examinations, students now get three to seven bonus marks depending on the grade that the student gets in the exams. Last year (2020), more than 188,000 students were awarded bonus marks in various categories.Officials from the education department said a decision in this regard is awaited. “We have received several requests from students, but the government will take a decision in this regard,” said an official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/grant-flexibility-in-bonus-mark-criteria-request-students-101617304199790.html
02-04-2021||Mumbai||Third leatherback turtle sighting reported in Maharashtra in 35 years||Fishermen in Palghar district inadvertently caught and released an endangered leatherback turtle (dermochelys coriacea) into the ocean on March 12 this year, about 70 to 80 nautical miles off the coast of Narpada village in Dahanu. The incident was brought to the attention of the forest department’s mangrove cell earlier this week. It marks the third record of the species in Maharashtra in 35 years and the second record with photographic evidence.Previously, a leatherback turtle had been captured and released by fishermen at Raigad’s Bharadkol beach in July 2019. The first-ever record of the species in Maharashtra, however, dates back to 1985 when a four-and-a-half foot long specimen was found on Devbagh beach in Malvan, as per the records of the Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute (CMFRI).The leatherback turtle is a Schedule-I species under India’s Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972. This particular species of oceanic turtle is also listed as vulnerable in the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species.Marine biologists from the Mangrove Foundation explained that little is known about the species’ occurrence along India’s west coast and that they are known to nest in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. They are the largest of the seven oceanic turtle species and can grow six feet in length and weigh over 500 kg.Within the wider Indian Ocean region, they are also known to nest in Sri Lanka, Indonesia, and South Africa. As per the IUCN, the status of the species in the northeast Indian Ocean is categorised as “data deficient”, while in southwest Indian Ocean they are categorised as “critically endangered”.“There is very little data about the species from India’s west coast, so it is definitely exciting to see them. While these sightings are uncommon, the two in the recent past have come from fishers. We should engage more with fishing communities to try and understand how often they see it. Perhaps that could be a first step to understand their distribution.” said Shaunak Modi from the Coastal Conservation Foundation.Modi’s view was echoed by Dhanashree Bagade, a marine biologist with Mangrove Foundation, who said, “There are several questions that an incident like this prompts. Is the turtle feeding in the area? Are they nesting? Is the area part of a migratory route that we don’t know about? Unfortunately we do not have answers just yet. Further study is required.”Prakash Tandel, the fisherman who released the turtle into the water on March 12 and filmed the process, will be entitled to a compensation of ₹25,000 under a scheme launched by the state government in December 2018 which reimburses fisherfolks for damage sustained to fishing equipment when an endangered marine animal has to be released. A total of 178 endangered marine organisms have been released after incidental capture under the scheme so far.Around 10 years ago, researchers also documented leatherback turtle nests in Raigad and Sindhudurg districts, but were unable to establish that they were nesting in the area. A similar incidental capture of a leatherback turtle was also reported from Kerala in 2008, albeit without photographic evidence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/third-leatherback-turtle-sighting-reported-in-maharashtra-in-35-years-101617304199319.html

The victim has been identified as Asad Khan, a leader of the Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen party, from Mailardevpally area in the old city. According to Mailardevpally police, Khan was going on his two-wheeler at around 1 pm, when a group of persons waylaid him near Indian Function Hall at Shastripuram road. They pushed him down from his vehicle and assaulted him with arms. “Preliminary inquiries revealed that Khan had rivalry with some persons in the area and was arrested in the past in connection with the murder of one Amjad Khan in Shastripuram. We suspect that the relatives or friends of the victim must be behind the murder of Asad Khan,” a police official from the Mailardevpally police station said. A 10-second video clip of a man attacking Khan repeatedly on his head with a sickle-like weapon went viral in the social media. The attacker was seen throwing the weapon on the road before fleeing the spot. Though there was normal traffic on the road, nobody bothered to come to the rescue of the victim. On receiving the information, the police rushed to the spot and shifted Khan to Osmania General Hospital, where he was declared brought dead. The Clues Team of the Hyderabad police was pressed into action to find out the evidences. “We are also examining CCTV cameras to identify the assailants,” the police said. The police have lodged a case of murder and have started investigation. Unconfirmed reports said the police have picked up six persons suspected to be linked to the murder and are questioning them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/man-hacked-to-death-in-public-in-hyderabad-101617304138729.html

Of the total cases, 50% are from rural areas. Last time, this ratio was three-fourth and one-fourth among urban and rural areas,” said Prasad. “This time, contacts of a positive case are getting infected fast and in large numbers. But in case of those vaccinated, fewer of their contacts are getting infected. Hence vaccination is necessary for all whether in rural or urban areas,” he said. “Those infected after second dose did not have serious illness,” he added. Stressing on complete vaccination, Prasad said gram nigrani samitis in rural pockets were being activated to keep a check on the spread of infection. “Do not skip the second dose as first dose does not give the expected protection. Do make use of the vaccination facility being provided for all people above the age of 45 years,” said Prasad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/50-of-covid-cases-from-rural-areas-acs-101617304079838.html

02-04-2021||Mumbai||State sees record one-day Covid spike||Maharashtra on Thursday recorded its highest single-day spike in Covid-19 cases with 43,183 new infections. Similarly, Mumbai also added a record number of 8,646 new infections. The state’s active case count rose to 366,533, while its total rose to 2,856,163. As Maharashtra continues to record daily highs, in terms of new infections and fatalities, health minister Rajesh Tope said that the government, at this point, does not intend to go for a complete lockdown. Instead, the restrictions will be made stricter, the minister said.For a second day straight, the state added over 200 fatalities. Maharashtra saw 249 deaths—highest in a day since October 17—on Thursday, taking the death toll to 54,898. Nagpur city had the highest deaths with 50 fatalities and 10 from its rural areas. Aurangabad city reported 35 deaths.Mumbai, meanwhile, added 18 fatalities, pushing its death toll to 11,708. Mumbai’s active case count rose to 54,807. The state also reported recoveries of 32,641 patients on Thursday, taking the tally of recovered patients to 2,433,368. In the last 24 hours, the state tested 183,198 samples, and had a positivity rate of 23.57%. The overall positivity rate of the state stood at 14.3%. Pune, Nagpur, Nashik and Aurangabad districts have contributed majorly in Thursday’s surge. Pune district added 8,025 new cases, while Nagpur district added 3,696. Nashik saw 3,039 new cases. Aurangabad district added 1,454 new cases. Tier-two cities and rural areas, too, have added considerable number of new cases on Thursday. Nanded added 1,322 new cases, Ahmednagar added 1,279 new cases, Jalgaon district added 1,065 new infections, Nandurbar added 466, and Satara added 528. Meanwhile, districts and cities in Vidarbha region (excluding Nagpur district) added 3,553 new cases and 10 deaths. Tope said that the state government will not immediately impose a complete lockdown.“At the moment, the restrictions will be made stricter for a few days. The chief minister takes the final call on the lockdown. He consults health department, task force, and others. The pros and cons of a lockdown will be weighed. Depending on the situation, a call will be taken. Lockdown is always the last alternative... There is no separate lockdown plan for Mumbai. It is true that cases are increasing but the BMC has increased testing and vaccination. Besides that, there is no shortage of beds in the city as of now,” Tope said. The minister added that a lockdown would also be imposed if the bed capacity of the state is exhausted. However, there are several steps before reaching the ultimate step.Senior bureaucrats, who are involved in the discussions, said that the government will gradually ramp up existing restrictions. The state government is deliberating on options including closing down markets, shops, malls, religious places theatres and even local trains in Mumbai, keeping it only for the workforce in the essential services category. A bureaucrat, who did not wish to be named, said that these options will be presented before chief minister Uddhav Thackeray in a day or two, when he reviews the situation.“There are several options on the table right now. But we cannot take the last step of closing down as our first step. The idea is to gradually tighten the existing restrictions, while enforcing the existing ones. A lockdown is not an immediate option; we have to look at the economy and epidemic. We are not using the word lockdown now, instead, it should be looked at in terms of severity of the restrictions. In those terms, the restrictions that will follow could be between 25% and 50% of what were there last year,” he said, requesting anonymity. The increasing death numbers are particularly a concern for state authorities. In the past two days, Maharashtra has added over 200 deaths daily. Health department officials and state Covid task force members attribute this to late detection and late admissions in hospitals. Maharashtra was seeing a decline in fatality figures since October 2020, which showed an upward trend in March. The state recorded 7,249 deaths in October, 3,240 deaths in November, 2,370 in December, 1,561 in January, 1,072 in February and 2,495 in March. Similarly, Mumbai has seen an increase in fatalities month-on-month. Mumbai saw 1,310 deaths in October, 645 in November, 232 in December, 236 in January, 123 in February, and 215 in March.Tope said that people should get tested early and seek medical advice if there is any major health issue, such aa breathing difficulty, etc. “I appeal to the people that they should get tested if they have any symptoms. If any positive case has low oxygen saturation, then they must get admitted immediately. If they delay then they will reach the hospital in a bad condition. Because of such cases, the fatality rate is increasing,” he said. A senior health department official said that people get tested late despite experiencing symptoms. “We have seen many late presentations [at hospitals] and they fall die within 24 hours of admission. If we have to stop the deaths, early detection and paying attention to any symptom are two important steps.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/state-sees-record-one-day-covid-spike-101617304018775.html
02-04-2021||Mumbai||State aims to inoculate 400,000 citizens a day||With over 27% or 33.8 million people having qualified for Covid-19 vaccination after those above 45 years of age were allowed to get a vaccine from Thursday, the Maharashtra government has set a target of vaccinating 400,000 beneficiaries a day. To help achieve the target, the state government has asked all vaccination centres, both private and public, to operate seven days a week.As a result of the new group of beneficiaries, the state witnessed its highest number of vaccinations in a day. More than 300,000 citizens were inoculated at 3,295 centres, with the highest, 57,000, in Pune. There were 216,211 beneficiaries on Wednesday. “With more than 6,500,000 vaccinated, the state remains on the top in the country,” a statement issued by the public health department stated.“Although the exact figures of beneficiaries inoculated on the first day are yet to come, the response has been very good in the state. We are asking private and government facilities to implement the vaccination drive all seven days of the week for the entire month of April. Some government facilities were implementing the drive three days a week. With operations for seven days a week, we expect the daily vaccination numbers to go up to 400,000 in the next few days,” said Dr Ramaswami N, commissioner, family welfare, and director, National Health Mission.Currently, the daily average of beneficiaries is around 225,000. DN Patil, state immunisation officer, said they are planning to increase the number of vaccination centres by 300 gradually over the next few days. Until March 31, Maharashtra had inoculated 5,495,934 beneficiaries, while 749,926 have been given a second shot too. Dr Ramaswami said the vaccination centres have already been allowed to operate 24x7 as per their convenience and the call over it was being taken at local level. “There will be more hospitals added to the list of vaccination centres. The hospitals have also been told to manage the drive in such a fashion that the wastage rate of the vaccine is reduced from the current 6.5%,” he said. When asked if the corporate houses will be allowed to hold vaccination sessions on their premises, he said that the decision about it has to be taken by the Centre. “Centre has told us that although Maharashtra tops in the terms of vaccination beneficiaries in the country, we need to double the rate of vaccination. They have assured us adequate supply of doses. We have been appealing people to come forward in large numbers for inoculation. Political parties and social outfits should ensure the people come to the centres like they beeline at polling booths,” said state health minister Rajesh Tope.Dr PD Gandhal, deputy director, Nashik Division, said, “We have around 500 vaccination centres in five districts in north Maharashtra with the daily average of vaccination of 22,000 beneficiaries. We expect it to increase after the addition of the new category of the beneficiaries. Since 90% of the healthcare and more than 80% of frontline workers in our division have been inoculated, we would not have any problem in taking addition load of beneficiaries.”State received 2,627,000 more doses on Wednesday ahead of the new phase that started from Thursday. State health department said that most of the centres received the additional stock of vaccines on Thursday. Until March 23, the stock of vaccine with the state was the 7,601,500 doses it received from the Central government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/state-aims-to-inoculate-400-000-citizens-a-day-101617303958669.html

The doctors allowed the veteran politician to walk and have solid foods on Thursday evening. “Our party president Sharad Pawar saheb is responding well to the treatment in hospital and is in the pink of health. He was checked upon by Dr Amit Maydeo at 7pm and he is now allowed to walk and take solid foods,” party’s chief spokesperson and state minority affairs minister Nawab Malik tweeted on Thursday. Dr Maydeo, a gastroenterologist and endoscopy expert, said it will take a few days for Pawar to recover completely. “He [Pawar] is doing fine and recovering from the issues, but it takes some time [to recover]. We will be able to consider discharging him only after two days,” he said. Pawar was admitted to Breach Candy on Tuesday night for the endoscopic procedure. He will have to be operated upon for a gallbladder surgery, for which he will have to be admitted again. This may take more than a week as he has swelling and inflammation in the pancreas. He was also suffering with jaundice when he was admitted to the hospital.

02-04-2021||Mumbai||PIL challenging CRZ 2019 notification filed in Bombay HC||Environmental action group Vanashakti has filed a public interest litigation (PIL) in the Bombay high court (HC) challenging the constitutional validity of the Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) notification, 2019 issued by the Union ministry of environment, forest and climate change (MoEFCC) under Environment (Protection) Act, 1986. The PIL has claimed the new CRZ regulations drastically reduces protection granted to coastal areas in the country by reducing No Development Zone Areas on the coast thus reducing the number of prohibited activities in CRZ areas. The PIL is expected to come up for hearing in due course. The PIL has claimed that the CRZ 2019 notification is unconstitutional, arbitrary and violates the right to live in a healthy environment and right to life. The PIL claims that some of the provisions in the notifications have already been struck down by the Supreme Court in earlier judgements and contrary to the recommendations of the various committees appointed by the government of India to review the CRZ regime. The petition also claims the provisions are in violation of section 5(3) of the Environment (Protection) Act and were not part of the draft CRZ notification. The PIL has further claimed that the 2019 notification reduces the limits of protected areas near tidally-influenced water bodies, dispensing with the requirement of conducting an Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) report in many instances, diluting essential components of Coastal Zone Maps, diluting protection granted to mangroves, increasing FSI in CRZ areas, deleting special protections granted to traditional fishermen communities, and deleting special provisions relating to Greater Mumbai. The PIL is expected to be heard for urgent interim reliefs in due course.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/pil-challenging-crz-2019-notification-filed-in-bombay-hc-101617303179190.html
02-04-2021||Noida||The new normal: Co-working spaces become popular workstations in Noida||When the Covid-19 outbreak brought the world to a standstill last year, no one imagined it would bring irreversible changes to people’s lifestyle, including work culture. Though office spaces in the country closed after the lockdown was imposed and many have still not opened up fully, coworking spaces in Noida are fast becoming a preferred place for working professionals.Coworking spaces provide readymade office space for small teams or individuals which are available on rent – starting from ₹200-400 per hour to ₹5,000 per month for a work station.Till 2020, coworking spaces in Noida were beginning to make a mark till the lockdown flattened their clientele. However, from September, these spaces again started seeing a surge in queries from people wanting to hire desks. “When the lockdown was imposed, it was a very depressing time for all coworking operators as there was no footfall. By January, however, occupancy at our coworking spaces almost equalled to that of the pre-Covid era,” said Mukul Parischa, founder of Springhouse coworking that has several such outlets in Noida,Those who run coworking spaces also ensure proper Covid norms are followed. “Due to social distancing norms, the seating arrangements and the number of people occupying a floor has changed. For instance, a desk that earlier had three seats now has two. Wearing a mask is mandatory and several awareness posters have been put up across the facility to remind people to follow Covid guidelines,” says Tejashwi Bansal, who runs a coworking space called ‘Unboxed’ in Sector 65.Though many working professionals were exulted with the work-from-home (WFH) arrangement which became a necessity due to the lockdown, a year on, it turns out that the new structure has not only led to a work-life imbalance but also resulted in lower productivity and output.“At home, my work would get delayed and I would end up sitting with my laptop for over 12 hours. By working out of a coworking space, I am able to focus better,” said Rajat Saxena, currently working out of a coworking space in Sector 41.“Working alone at home was taking a toll on me. Now, I work from a coworking space at least thrice a week,” said Janet Jose, a resident of East Delhi who works with an MNC in Noida’s Sector 16.Those who operate such spaces agree that most of the clientele are professionals working with MNCs who are tired of the WFH module. “Working professionals are opting for flexible options which allow them to work out of a coworking space at least once or twice a week,” said Vinayak Agarawal, co-founder of MyHQ, which collaborates with other co-working spaces.Many companies gave up their offices last year but are now looking to go back to their previous setups.For Ghaziabad resident Abhilash Singh, moving from his rented office in Noida’s Sector 2 to a coworking space called ‘Hackerspace’ in the same area was a logical decision. “After working from home for almost ten months, we decided to resume operations from an office in January. However, this time, renting a space was off the table. Coworking spaces came to my rescue because now, I do not have to worry about operation costs, which have reduced. Opting for a coworking office reduced operation costs by almost 60%,” said Singh.Kavita Sharma, who runs an online platform called Ziyyara Edutech Pvt. Ltd, has shifted from a rented office in Sector 2 to a coworking space in Sector 16 with her team of 10. “This has been a boon. If it wasn’t for the pandemic, I wouldn’t have shifted to a coworking space but continued paying rent out of my earnings,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/the-new-normal-co-working-spaces-become-popular-workstations-in-noida-101617302938615.html
02-04-2021||Noida||Noida achieves 85% of daily target on day 1 of vaccination for people above 45 years||NOIDA: Gautam Budh Nagar achieved almost 85% of its target on Thursday, with 8,583 people being inoculated out of the goal of 10,000 beneficiaries for the day across 88 booths. The district is to vaccinate at least 1.62 lakh people above the age of 45 years in the month.District magistrate Suhas LY said: “We’ve already chalked out a micro plan to achieve this target on time. There is no need for a co-morbidity certificate for people aged between 45 and 59 years in the April vaccination drive. Although nearly 15% of the target was missed, we hope it will pick up pace in the coming days. We have already planned to increase the daily target to 10,000 for Mondays, Thursdays and Fridays and 3,500 for Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Saturdays, which will cover over 40,000 people in a week,” he said. Suhas further said that the number of booths will also be increased to 120 in the coming days. “The daily vaccination per booth will also be doubled from 125 at present to 250. Our officials are repeatedly making appeals to all eligible citizens to get themselves registered to get their shots,” he said.Echoing similar views, Dr Deepak Ohri, chief medical officer (CMO), said that the number of vaccination booths will be increased in private hospitals as well. “In Thursday’s vaccination drive, the number of booths in private hospitals was 39, while there were 49 booths in government facilities. We are trying our level best to allot vaccination booths in hospitals in close to where beneficiaries live,” he said. Dr Neeraj Tyagi, the in-charge of vaccination in the district, said that out of the 8,583 persons inoculated, as many as 3,240 were senior citizens while the remaining were in the age group of 45 to 59 years. “The Government Institute of Medical Sciences inoculated 410 persons while 180 were vaccinated at Sharda hospital,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-achieves-85-of-daily-target-on-day-1-of-vaccination-for-people-above-45-years-101617302518650.html
02-04-2021||Noida||Noida admin asks private hospitals to get ready with Covid-19 beds||NOIDA: Taking note of the surge in coronavirus (Covid-19) cases, the Gautam Budh Nagar district administration has asked all major private hospitals in the district to prepare beds for Sars-Cov-2 patients in their premises. A final call on whether these private hospitals need to restart their Covid wards is yet to be taken, said officials.Till January this year, several private hospitals in the district ran Covid-19 wards in the district. However, on January 13, the administration had de-notified most of the private Covid facilities in the district – except for the District Hospital in Sector 39, the Government Institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS) in Greater Noida, Yatharth hospital in Sector 108 and Fortis hospital in Sector 62.In January this year, the district had a total of 2,964 beds for Covid-19 patients. As of now, the district has a total of 250 beds for Covid-19 patients – 200 in government facilities and 50 in private ones.According to district magistrate Suhas LY, the decision was taken in light of the increase in cases, which he said was almost three-fold in March (564 new cases) as compared to February (179 new cases).“At present, both the government hospitals – the District Hospital and GIMS – have a capacity to accommodate nearly 600 patients. However, to tackle an emergency situation, all major private hospitals in the district which were serving as Covid-19 facilities during the peak of the pandemic, have been asked to ready beds again. If the graph of new cases increases at the same rate, we’ll take the final decision on making private hospitals dedicated Covid facilities in a week,” he said.However, they did not specify how many Covid beds each of these private hospitals needs to be ready. As per information received by late Thursday, however, Sharda hospital had been readied a 350-bed Covid facility.The district’s chief medical officer (CMO), Dr Deepak Ohri, said: “At present, only two private Covid facilities – Yatharth and Fortis hospitals – are operative in the district, but their joint capacity of beds is only about 100. If new cases keep coming up at the same rate, we’ll have no option other than to ask private hospitals to restart their Covid-dedicated wards in their premises,” he said.Additional chief medical officer (ACMO), Dr Lalit Kumar, who is also the in-charge of home isolation in the district, said that as of Wednesday, out of 331 active Covid-19 patients in the district, as many as 131 were asymptomatic and were permitted home isolation. “The remaining 200 are under treatment in different government and private Covid-19 facilities in the district,” he said.The country on Thurs reported about 72,000 new cases, with neighbouring Delhi as many as 2,790 fresh cases at a positivity rate of 3.57%. While the national Capital recorded nine deaths, the country recorded an overall 459 Covid deaths in the past 24 hours.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-admin-asks-private-hospitals-to-get-ready-with-covid-19-beds-101617301978536.html
02-04-2021||Noida||Covid-19: Ghaziabad sees 66% coverage on day 1 of vaccination for people above 45 years||Ghaziabad: On Thursday, when Ghaziabad district was to vaccinate 14,000 beneficiaries against the coronavirus (Covid-19) disease, only 9309 beneficiaries could be administered the jab across 96 centres. Thursday was also when the vaccination drive for people aged above 45 years was initiated. The Ghaziabad district is to achieve a target of inoculating 216,000 beneficiaries by April 30.According to official figures, out of the 96 centres, 29 were at private, where 2794 persons were inoculated, while 67 were government facilities, where 6,515 beneficiaries got their jabs. The day’s coverage was about 66.49%.“We are trying to cover more beneficiaries per day, and will improve our coverage in the coming days. We have already asked our officers to spread awareness among the public to take up vaccination. Ahead of the upcoming panchayat elections, we have also issued an advisory to contesting candidates to spread awareness about vaccination among the masses and help us bring more people to vaccination centres,” district magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey said.As per the target given by the Uttar Pradesh government, the district has been given a target of inoculating 216,000 beneficiaries this month, with the weekly target being 54,000. On Thursday, some of the vaccination centres reported a huge rush in the morning, and officials had to depute home guards and also call up local police control room vans to help control the crowd. “There was a huge rush in the morning hours and people who were lined up were hardly maintaining social distancing. Even after repeated appeals made by us and intervention by home guards, they did not listen. So, we called up the local police for help. Once the PCR van arrived, the queues came in order,” said Dr Sanjay Teotia, chief medical superintendent of the government-run Sanjay Nagar Combined District Hospital.The hospital was able to vaccinate 440 people on Thursday, exceeding its target of 400 for the day. It also started functioning as dedicated Covid L2 category (for mild and moderate symptomatic Covid patients) hospital from Thursday and doubling up as a Covid testing centre. The primary health centre at Shastri Nagar, meanwhile, vaccinated 376 beneficiaries against its target of 300 for the day. Health centres at Vasundhara, Makanpur (Indirapuram), Rajbagh and Vijay Nagar (1) also exceeded their respective targets of vaccinating 200 beneficiaries each on Thursday. The performing health centres are in city areas. On the other hand, none of the 15 government-run health-and-wellness centres (additional PHCs) in rural segments of Loni, Muradnagar, Bhojpur and Dasna could achieve their target of vaccinating 100 beneficiaries each on Thursday. They could vaccinate only between 10 and 90 beneficiaries, official data shows. Regarding the ongoing vaccination drive, state officials said they will be starting with “focussed vaccination” for beneficiaries of specific groups such as bankers, teachers, vendors, drivers, media persons and lawyers, among others, for whom specific days for inoculation will be chalked out by next week.“We are chalking out a calendar for focused vaccination of specific groups and they will be requested to come for the shots to their nearest centre. Although such people aged over 45 years can always go to their nearest centre for taking up vaccination any day. But on days chalked out in the calendar, we will request specific groups to come and take up vaccination,” said Amit Mohan Prasad, UP’s additional chief secretary (health).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/covid19-ghaziabad-sees-66-coverage-on-day-1-of-vaccination-for-people-above-45-years-101617301858490.html
02-04-2021||Delhi||Man found hanging, his wife and children with throats slit; cops say it was murder-suicide||The body of a 31-year-old contractual Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) bus driver was found hanging from a ceiling fan at his home in a village near outer Delhi’s Rohini early Thursday, while his wife and two sons – aged 3 and 6 years – were found dead with their throats slit in the same room, police said.The police said a “suicide note”, purportedly written by the man, was found in the room and the contents of the note suggested that he allegedly murdered his wife and children before killing himself. Since the room was locked from inside, as of now, neither the family members nor the police is suspecting any foul play. The man had allegedly attempted to die by suicide, by slitting his wrist around three years ago, his family told police.The one-page note mentioned that the man was upset that his two sons had developmental challenges. It went on to talk of other personal and family issues that he had, apart from concerns about his parents and grandmother, said a senior police officer who asked not to be named.“Prime facie, it appears that the note was written by the man before he took his life. However, it will be examined by experts before it is confirmed as his,” the officer said, adding that they have learnt that apart from the man and his two children, his mother and grandmother too had mental health issues.Police said the family lived in a single-room flat on the second floor of the building, while the first floor is occupied by his elder brother, a government hospital employee, his wife, a teacher, and their two children. Their parents and grandmother live on the ground floor.The man’s brother said he was sleeping when he heard his brother quarrelling with his wife on the second floor around 2am on Thursday. He sent his wife to pacify the couple. “My wife returned after a few minutes and we went to sleep,” said the brother.In the morning around 5am, the man’s father went to wake him up as he had to leave for his morning DTC bus duty. The father found the door locked from inside. When nobody responded to his repeated knocks, the father panicked and peeped into the room through a ventilation space after climbing onto a container drum. He found his son hanging from a ceiling fan and immediately raised the alarm, said the dead man’s uncle.“The police were informed. A team arrived and broke open the door. My nephew’s wife’s body was on the floor while the bodies of their two children were on the bed. The police cordoned off the entire floor,” said the uncle.Deputy commissioner of police (Rohini) Pranav Tayal said the bodies were shifted to a nearby government hospital for autopsy. “A case of murder was registered and it is being probed. The suicide note recovered from the scene is in the police custody,” said Tayal.According to the man’s brother, the DTC driver often had quarrels with his wife, mainly over the health issues of their sons. “Our mother and grandmother also have mental health issues. My brother thought that his sons’ problems were genetic,” the brother said.Around three years ago, the brother said the man had slit his writs at his workplace in Paharganj over what seemed to him “ a trivial issue”.Psychiatrist Samir Parikh, director of Fortis National Mental Health Programme, said, “The concern about mental health issues is that we are either frightened by them or try to hide them. It is the responsibility of society, family, friends, relatives and neighbours to identify an individual’s mental issues early and get such persons timely treatment. Ensuring a support system for such patients may help avoid suicides.”If you need support or know someone who does, please reach out to your nearest mental health specialists.

02-04-2021||Delhi||Trial of faceless transport services a hit, helps RTOs reduce pendency||In a first, the Delhi transport department has been able to clear 64% (49,653) of the 77,421 online applications it received for services related to driver’s licence (DL) and vehicle registration certificate (RC) between February 18 and March 30, government data showed.The online system for applying and getting clearance for transport documents is a new project undertaken by the Delhi government through which it aims to take nearly 70 essential transport services completely online in two phases over the next few months.The data cited above is part of the findings from an ongoing trial run, which began from February 19. Currently, 12 services, including renewal and duplicate DL or RC, permit or RC transfer, among others, have been shifted to the online mode completely. The second phase will include 58 services.“The low number of pending application is quite encouraging given the fact that this is the first time that a state is attempting to provide 100% faceless transport services. The project aims to decongest all RTOs (regional transport offices) of the city as it will allow people to get important documents from the comfort of their homes,” said transport minister Kailash Gahlot.Data showed that of the 77,421 applications, only 22,466 (29%) were pending as on March 30. While the RTO at Surajmal Vihar cleared 72% of online applications, the Burari auto unit RTO had the highest pendency of applications at 78%.As for DL related documents, the department received 29,441 e-applications and only 1,070 (3.63%) are pending as on March 30.During the period between February 18 and March 30, the transport department received 47,980 online applications for RC related documents of which 21,396 (44.6%) are pending. The applications ranged from change of address, renewal of RC, addition/termination of hypothecation, issue of NOC for sale of vehicle in a different state, duplicate RC and so on. The RTOs at north Delhi’s Mall Road and Central Delhi’s Indraprastha had cleared 65% and 60% of the applications, respectively.Special commissioner (transport) KK Dahiya said in the pre-Covid times, Delhi’s 13 RTOs together used to witness a footfall of at least 100,000 every month. “The trial period itself has ensured that at least 77,000 people did not have to visit any RTO. All these applicants received or will receive their RC or DL related documents at their homes via speed post,” he said.Once fully implemented, only applicants seeking a learner’s licence or permanent DL or vehicle fitness certificate will have to physically visit the RTOs as these documents require applicants to appear for tests, Dahiya added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/trial-of-faceless-transport-services-a-hit-helps-rtos-reduce-pendency-101617301260016.html
02-04-2021||Delhi||Enthusiastic start to inoculation of all above 45 years, many centres achieve 100% target||Hospitals and dispensaries across the city saw long queues outside Covid-19 vaccination centres on Thursday, when the city’s immunisation drive was opened up to all those who are above the age of 45 years. To ensure maximum turnout, Delhi government-run hospitals are informing patients arriving for doctor consultations about the inoculation drive and urging them to take the jab, and also inviting residents’ welfare associations to book bulk slots for entire societies.So far, only people above the age of 60 years and those between the ages of 45 and 59 years with a combination of 20 specified comorbidities were being administered the Covid-19 vaccine. There are nearly 4.5 million people between the ages of 45 and 59 living in Delhi, health minister Satyendar Jain had said on Wednesday.The city plans to immunise everyone in this age group within 40 days.“The government has set a target of immunising everyone over the age of 45 years within the next 40 days. To ensure that this happens, we will start creating more and more vaccination centres, training more vaccinators to man these centres, keeping centres open for 12 hours, and motivating people to come and get immunised,” said a senior official from Delhi’s health department, asking not to be named.The Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences in Vasant Kunj has sent out invitations to all residents’ welfare associations in neighbouring areas to book bulk slots for those living in their societies. “Initially, when the drive opened to those above the age of 60 years and those above the age of 45 with comorbidities, we had immunised over 800 to 900 people a day, but the numbers dwindled gradually. This time, we have invited RWAs to book slots for residents to come and get the shot,” said Dr SK Sarin, director, ILBS.The number of people being immunised at trans-Yamuna region’s Guru Teg Bahadur hospital jumped by nearly 150 on Thursday. “We had people queuing up outside the vaccination sites since morning -- usually the sites are not full even by 11am. The hospital vaccinated over 400 people today (Thursday),” said Dr RS Rautela, medical director, Guru Teg Bahadur hospital.He said doctors in the out-patient clinics are now routinely telling all patients over the age of 45 years to get vaccinated. “I’m urging more and more people to get the shot. There are very minor adverse events such as body ache or redness at the site of injection,” Dr Rautela said.At Delhi government-run Lok Nayak Hospital, which has immunised over 10,000 people so far, announcements are being made in the out-patient clinic urging people to get vaccinated. “In addition to doctors advising their patients, we are also making announcements in the OPD urging people to get their shot the same day once they are done with their consultation. Sometimes, patients do not have their ID cards on them; we ask them to bring them when they come next to give their samples or collect medicines,” said Dr Suresh Kumar, medical director, Lok Nayak Hospital.Other than that, there are five persons posted at each of the floors of the hospital OPD imparting to people information about the vaccines.An official from the east district said on condition of anonymity, “Today, there was a lot of enthusiasm among people and we saw over 100% vaccination at many of our sites. However, that was the case when the drive was opened to those above the age of 60 years and those above 45 with comorbidities. But, the turnout gradually dwindled. This time around, maybe we can sustain the pace because people are now scared by the increasing number of Covid infections. But we also need to create awareness among people.”Talking about the awareness campaign, he said, “We have a list of all the people over the age of 45 years in our area, and we are sending them text messages. The booth level officers have been asked to call at least 10 people daily and urge them to get vaccinated. The ASHA (accredited social health activists) and ANMs (auxiliary nurse-midwives) are going door to door to motivate people. In addition, we are distributing pamphlets with information on how to get registered and nearby vaccination centres. We are making announcements through police speakers in marketplaces as well on the speaker system on garbage vans.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/enthusiastic-start-to-inoculation-of-all-above-45-years-many-centres-achieve-100-target-101617301258508.html
02-04-2021||Delhi||AAP, MCDs play the blame game over lack of irrigation measures in parks||The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Thursday hit out at the three municipal corporations of Delhi (MCDs) for failing to create adequate alternatives for irrigation purposes in parks, after the National Green Tribunal (NGT) in 2019 disallowed the use of tube wells for the purpose. While AAP members alleged that around 14,500 parks that come under the civic bodies were turning barren due to inadequate alternatives, members of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led municipal corporations said it is the failure of the Delhi government to provide treated water, as per the NGT orders.Senior AAP leader and party’s chief spokesperson Saurabh Bharadwaj on Thursday said that “MCDs were closing tube wells” in their parks on NGT order and it would “ruin” greenery in parks. He criticised the NGT order but stressed that the three municipalities “failed” to develop alternative methods of irrigation using treated water.“The BJP-ruled MCD did not deploy tankers even after two years of NGT’s order. Delhi government is ready to provide water free of cost from its Sewage Treatment Plants (STP) but BJP-ruled MCDs want these parks to dry up. Now, MCD plans to close all these tube wells. The NGT had said that while the tube wells need to be closed, MCD should alternatively use the sewer water, after it is processed at STPs, transport them using MCD tankers and use it for irrigation purposes. The lack of irrigation is turning these parks into dry lands. Saplings that would have potentially turned into big trees tomorrow are not able to fully bloom and trees too are drying up,” he said.He said that the NGT in 2019 ordered a shutdown of all tube wells used to irrigate parks and directed MCDs and the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) to draw water supply from the STPs.Till last week, at least 700 tube wells across the three civic bodies were sealed on the directions of the NGT.Bharadwaj said that the Delhi Jal Board (DJB) was also asked by the NGT to create the necessary infrastructure to implement this plan. Within a five-kilometre radius of every STP, the scheme should be implemented and the DJB should take initiative for its efficient implementation.“Following this, DJB decided that water from the STPs will now be provided free of cost for irrigation work, for lake construction or water recycling purposes. Thus, DJB completed its end of the bargain and opened the way for MCD to send its tankers and irrigate the parks,” Bharadwaj said.However, the three municipalities blamed the city government for the current state of affairs.BJP leader and leader of the House in South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC), Narendra Chawla, said that the AAP is making baseless allegations regarding the supply of water in parks. “It is the Delhi government’s duty to ensure supply of treated water. The NGT, in its earlier order, has clearly asked them to ensure water supply from STPs to the parks. Despite having a duty to supply water, the Delhi government has failed to comply with the order. The DJB has been sealing bore wells but not maintaining the supply of water,” Chawla said.After reports started emerging on parks drying up, Chawla said the SDMC had approached the DJB but to no avail. “Finally, we have approached the NGT for extension in sealing of bore wells till the DJB ensures supply of water to parks,” Chawla said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/aap-mcds-play-the-blame-game-over-lack-of-irrigation-measures-in-parks-101617301200403.html
02-04-2021||Delhi||East civic agency penalised ₹40 lakh over fire at Ghazipur landfill||The Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) on Thursday, on the orders of Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai, issued a penalty of ₹40 lakh to the East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC) for its alleged “carelessness” in preventing a fire that broke out at the Ghazipur landfill on Sunday.The DPCC noted that several incidents of fires at the Ghazipur landfill indicate a lack of preventive measures. The order was issued on Thursday after Rai asked DPCC to conduct an inquiry into the incident.“EDMC’s carelessness was the major contributor in the Ghazipur landfill fire. This incident has extensively contributed to the pollution in the area. The findings of DPCC clearly show that the EDMC was extremely careless. Based on the probe, the DPCC has issued a penalty of Rs.40 lakh to EDMC,” Rai said.Nirmal Jain, mayor of EDMC, said, “We have only got a notice from the DPCC regarding fire at Ghazipur landfill and have been asked to reply in 15 days. We will submit our reply and explain about measures being taken by us to control such fires. In the notice, there is no mention about the money. It is a statement of Gopal Rai that we have been fined with ₹40 lakh. This statement shows his political malice towards the EDMC.”The pollution control committee also sought a detailed report from the EDMC on the necessary steps taken. “The EDMC should submit this report within 15 days of getting the notice. The DPCC report also shows that the MCD had no proper arrangements to douse the fire,” Rai said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/east-civic-agency-penalised-rs-40-lakh-over-fire-at-ghazipur-landfill-101617301199780.html
02-04-2021||Delhi||Kejriwal to inaugurate revamped Chandni Chowk stretch on April 17||Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal will inaugurate the revamped and redeveloped section of Chandni Chowk on April 17. The 1.3km main carriageway between Red Fort and Fatehpuri mosque in the heritage market has been beautified and made pedestrian only on all days between 9am and 9pm.“It is a historical heritage site and the entire area has been beautified, in an effort to bring back its glory days of yore. Now that the project is complete, tourism will get a major boost as people coming to Delhi would most definitely want to pay a visit to Chandni Chowk,” said Kejriwal in a statement shared by the government.Conceived by the Congress-led Delhi government in 2006, the ₹99 crore project was much delayed and work finally started only in December 2018, on the directions and monitoring of the Delhi high court. In December 2018, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia laid the foundation stone for the redevelopment project.In the first phase of the project, utilities such as electric cables and other networks were taken underground, and dedicated lanes for non-motorised transport and walkways were constructed. Facilities such as toilets, ATMs, benches for visitors etc, have been provided in the redeveloped space. The Shahjahanabad Redevelopment Corporation (SRDC), which is the nodal agency for the redevelopment project, plans to start work on improving the façade of the heritage market in the second phase.Garima Gupta, managing director, SRDC, said while some work is remaining, it would be completed in the next two weeks. “The work is almost complete now. The project includes various stages and things will keep happening simultaneously. In another 15 days, we should be able to complete the work in all respects,” said Gupta.A senior Delhi public works department (PWD) official, on condition of anonymity, said, “We have to install a few CCTV cameras, some streetlights and get the basic cleaning done. All these will be done in the next few days. Traffic police is making arrangements to ensure that vehicles don’t enter the revamped stretch.”While the first deadline for the project was November 2020, it was later revised to March 2021 due to several delaying factors such as the Covid-19 pandemic and the legal hurdles in removing encroachments, including a few religious structures.Gupta said, “There have been various reasons due to which delays had occurred. The Covid-19 pandemic hampered the work progress as well.”Sanjay Bhargava, president, Chandni Chowk Sarv Vyapar Mandal, said while the government is planning to inaugurate the project in the next two weeks, a significant amount of work is yet to be done. “On the ground, there is so much work that needs to be done. Lights and CCTV cameras have to be fixed. There are plans for stopping vehicular movement between 9am and 9pm, but there is no clarity on how this will be implemented. There are encroachments at Fountain Chowk and a few other points that need to be removed. I’m not sure if all that work can be completed in about 15 days,” he said.But government officials said a detailed plan is being worked out to stop vehicles from entering the redeveloped area. As vehicular movement will be banned during the daytime, the Delhi government plans to introduce electric vehicles for public convenience. In a meeting held on March 25, the Delhi Integrated Multimodal Transit System was asked to submit a detailed report on plying electric vehicles on the 1.3km stretch.A senior Delhi government official said there were many challenges in the redevelopment project such as taking the electric cables underground, shifting transformers and replacing sewage and water lines, among others. “A dedicated water line has been installed for the fire hydrants on both sides of the road and inside the very congested and inaccessible markets,” said the official, asking not to be named.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/kejriwal-to-inaugurate-revamped-chandni-chowk-stretch-on-april-17-101617301198533.html
02-04-2021||Delhi||Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal to chair emergency meeting on Covid-19 surge today||Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal will chair an emergency meeting with health minister Satyendar Jain and other senior officials on Friday in light of the surging Covid-19 cases in the Capital, a statement issued by the chief minister’s office said.Delhi, on Thursday, recorded 2,790 new Covid-19 cases and nine more deaths, with the positivity rate — the proportion of samples that return positive among the total tested — in the city hovering around the 3.57% mark, the government’s health bulletin said. The positivity rate, which is indicative of the ongoing spread of the infection, had remained below 1% consecutively for 82 days between December 28 and March 19.Friday’s meeting, officials said, is scheduled to take place at 4 pm in the chief minister’s residence and is likely to touch on plans concerning containment, vaccination and hospital beds in the city to arrest the fresh Covid-19 surge. The chief minister has also directed department heads to prepare action plans regarding the same, the statement added.“In the wake of the rising Covid-19 cases in Delhi, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal has been closely monitoring the situation. Expressing grave concern over the matter, he has decided to hold an urgent meeting on April 2, 4pm onwards. Health Minister Satyendar Jain, along with his department officials, will be a part of the meeting,” read the statement issued by the government on Thursday.It further said, “Including Delhi, the entire country is witnessing a surge in cases in the recent past. CM Kejriwal is ensuring a daily review by receiving regular updates from the officials. In furtherance to the orders given by CM Kejriwal, the health department has increased its vigilance measures, and has taken a number of monumental steps to combat Covid-19.”Expressing concerns over violation of Covid-19 rules, such as wearing of masks and social distancing, the statement goes on to add, “At the district level, surveillance teams are overseeing that people follow Covid appropriate behaviour, the most important of them being wearing masks. Also, after orders by CM Kejriwal, a target of conducting as many as 80,000 tests has been set on a daily basis, so as to contain the spread of the virus.”As Delhi continues being in the grip of what experts call the fourth wave of Covid-19 cases, the number of active cases in the Capital has increased exponentially from 1,404 on March 1 to 10,498 on April 1, government records showed.Last week, state health minister Satyendar Jain had, however, ruled out the possibility of a lockdown in Delhi. Senior officials of the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA), on their part, maintained that at this stage, the government has plans to scale up testing, tracing, isolation, containment and vaccination drives.Experts expressed concerns over the sharp increase in cases in Delhi.Dr Lalit Kant, former head of the epidemiology and communicable diseases division at the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), said: “There is a steep increase in numbers in this particular phase of surge in cases. It strongly suggests that mutant variants of the virus can be playing a role. Delhi needs to further scale up contact tracing and tests, especially RT-PCR tests which are more accurate.”Dr Suneela Garg, director professor of community medicines department, Maulana Azad Medical College in Delhi and member of the Lancet Covid-19 commission and vaccination task force for India, said: “Compliance is low when it comes to wearing masks, maintaining social distance and adhering to Covid-19 appropriate behaviour. That has to be taken care of at the earliest. Other than that, the government has to increase the pace of immunisation. For that, it has to invest more on mobilisation and awareness campaigns.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/kejriwal-to-chair-emergency-meeting-on-covid-19-surge-today-101617301141548.html
02-04-2021||Delhi||New academic session to be online for now, orders Delhi government||The Delhi government directed all schools in the national capital to continue classes in the online mode for the new academic session — it started on Thursday — and not to call students in-person to attend classes till further orders. The government has asked all schools to strictly comply with the directive.Schools in Delhi have been conducting online classes and exams for all students till class 8 since March last year, owing to restrictions put in place to check the spread of Covid-19. Between January 18 and February 5, the Delhi government, however, had allowed schools to reopen for students of classes 9 to 12, to allow practical work and remedial lessons.In a circular issued for all private and government schools on Thursday, the Directorate of Education (DoE) said students of classes 9 to 12 (session 2020-21) may continue to come to school, with the due consent of parents, for their exams and practical work and will strictly and compulsorily adhere to Covid safety norms.“It is again clarified that no student should be called to school for the fresh academic session 2021-22 till further orders. However, teaching-learning activities may be commenced from April 1, 2021, for students through digital modes,” the circular stated.A majority of Delhi schools, both government and private, started their new academic session virtually on Thursday. Schools that had prepared to begin their session with in-person lessons for students of classes 9 to 12 also announced a switchback to online mode, following the government directive.HT had on Wednesday reported that the government has not taken any decision of allowing in-person classes for students in the new academic session.Jyoti Arora, principal of Mount Abu School in Rohini, where in-person classes were scheduled to begin for students of classes 10 and 12, said, “As per the government’s directive, we will now continue online classes from Monday onwards.”The principals of several schools welcomed the government decision. Tania Joshi, principal of The Indian School, said, “Considering the rising Covid-19 cases, we had started online classes. Our priority at the moment is to cater to students appearing for their boards this year because their exams are less than two months away and they were away from schools for a whole year. It is sad that we have to start another academic year without having our students physically present in school. But that is the best decision to ensure their safety.”Ameeta Wattal, principal of Springdales School, said, “We are hoping that this surge in Covid-19 cases subsides before the beginning of the (CBSE) board exams. But right now, continuing with online classes is the best alternative.”Many students were disappointed to learn that they would be starting another academic session online. Nine-year-old Sehas Singh attended the introductory session of her new class virtually at the Indian School on Thursday. “Our class teacher showed us our new classroom virtually and introduced us to other students. I miss my school, especially the playground. We also prayed that the situation becomes normal soon and we can return to our school,” said the class 4 student.Some students also felt that students scheduled to appear for their board exams next year might be at a slight disadvantage.“We had online classes for class 9 and now it seems that virtual classes will continue in class 10 as well. That means nearly two years of online education in a crucial period of our lives. Besides, while the current class 10 students are appearing for their boards in May with a reduced syllabus, we may not have the same luxury and may have to appear for the boards next March with the full syllabus,” said Amrita Arun, a class 10 student at a private school in south Delhi.Experts too raised concerns over the lack of peer-to-peer interaction among younger children. Anubha Rajesh, chair professor at Jamia Millia Islamia’s Centre for Early Childhood Development and Research, said, “The pandemic has affected children in different domains of their development, especially the younger ones whose early years lay a foundation for lifelong learning. These children are in a home environment while having no opportunities for games and physical exercise and interaction with peers. Since schools have had time to develop emergent measures, care must now be taken to address these psychosocial issues in innovative ways too. Also, a one-size-fits-all approach cannot be used and schools must devise means to address the digital divide and facilitate learning for disadvantaged children.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/new-academic-session-to-be-online-for-now-orders-delhi-government-101617301140888.html
02-04-2021||Delhi||A year and 908 convictions later, Nizamuddin Markaz reopens with strict Covid protocols||Every evening since Sunday, a representative of the Nizamuddin Markaz diligently visits the Hazrat Nizamuddin police station with a list of 50 names and their accompanying identity papers. These 50 are the only men allowed to enter and pray inside the building during Shab-e-Barat this year, as part of a March 24 Delhi high court order, which allowed the conditional reopening of the Markaz, almost a year after it emerged as a Covid-19 hot spot and had to be sealed.Until the building was sealed last year on April 1, it housed around 2,500 people, including foreigners, belonging mainly to the Tablighi Jamaat — a transnational Sunni Islamic missionary movement.A management official of the Markaz building, who asked not to be named, said, “Earlier, we would give the police the names and details of only foreigners who came to the Markaz. This was the standard practice. But now, we do it for everyone. After months of approaching various courts, we got permission to reopen on March 28. Looking back at what happened here last year, we can say that the Markaz attendees were in the right place at the wrong time,”The Delhi government had declared the Markaz one of Delhi’s first hot spots of Covid-19, prompting Nizamuddin basti and other nearby areas to be sealed and contained to prevent the spread of the virus. The evacuation of Tablighi Jamaat attendees ended on April 1, 2020, after a 36-hour evacuation drive, during which 2,358 people were shifted to quarantine centres and hospitals across the city.Records seen by HT show that as part of the contact tracing of Markaz visitors, police analysed 2,850 cellphone numbers of people who were inside the Markaz, or had come in touch with those inside the building, and tracked down 39,300 people using call records. Of these, police teams on the ground got in touch with at least 25,050 people.Delhi Police officers call it the “biggest contact tracing exercise” till date for the city.After the building was identified as a hot spot, the Union government had in April last year said the infection in places outside Delhi — such as Telangana, Mumbai and Andaman Islands — were also linked to people who had visited the Markaz. In mid-April last year, at least 1,000 of the 1,578 Covid-19 cases in Delhi at the time, were related to the congregation inside the building, Delhi government data showed.THE INVESTIGATION As part of the investigation, the Delhi Police’s crime team had on March 31 filed an FIR under the Epidemic Diseases Act, the Disaster Management Act and under sections of the Indian Penal Code, which included those of culpable homicide not amounting to murder and criminal conspiracy. The people named in FIRs as on March 31 included Tablighi Jamaat chief Maulana Saad, and six other top officials of the religious sect,for defying a series of government directives, which curbed religious and large gatherings to contain the spread of Covid-19 in the national capital.Records seen by HT show that the Delhi Police charged 952 foreigners from 36 countries. The crime branch registered the FIR on March 31. Police and court records show that while 908 foreigners entered a plea bargain and pled guilty to the charges, 44 people chose to face trial and contest the charges, and were later acquitted. HT spoke to several officers in the crime branch who confirmed that Maulana Saad has not been charged in any of the charge sheets till date.Delhi Police spokesperson, Chinmoy Biswal, said, “On the acquittal of the 44 people, we are going to appeal in a higher court. The police’s case has resulted in the conviction of 908 people. The cases were presented in court and they were convicted. We do not want to name any individuals because =we are still investigating the case.”A Tablighi Jamaat attendee from Indonesia, who refused to be identified, on a phone call said, “Had we stayed on in India, even we would have been acquitted. But we had a difficult choice to make. We could either wait several months for the trial to get over or enter into a plea bargain, serve a minor sentence, and return home. We had already spent 100 days in the quarantine centre and wanted to go back home. The allegation that Tablighi Jamaat attendees deliberately spread the infection is wrong.”All those who pled guilty and were convicted by the courts were not sent to prison. The courts said that the attendees had already served their sentences during their stay in the quarantine facilities.Shahid Ali, a spokesperson of the Markaz, who is also a lawyer, said, “It was a political conspiracy by the Delhi government. The Delhi government misused its power and wrote to the L-G to file an FIR against Markaz. This is how everything started.Police had no evidence against Maulana Saad and others in the first place because of which, he was never charged. Even those people evacuated from the building were the ones trapped inside because a nationwide lockdown was imposed suddenly and everything closed down in Delhi. But we do not want to dwell in the past. We are glad that the Markaz is finally open again. Tablighi Jamaat is not a political organisation. People who were charged have been acquitted, while foreigners who were living away from their families entered a plea bargain and have returned to their families back home. We hold no grudges against anyone.”Delhi government spokespersons did not respond to requests for a comment on the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/a-year-and-908-convictions-later-nizamuddin-markaz-reopens-with-strict-covid-protocols-101617301140199.html
02-04-2021||Delhi||Delhi govt to install the tricolour in schools to mark 75 years of Independence||Moving ahead with its plan to install the tricolour across the national capital to mark 75 years of Independence, the Delhi government has decided to put up the national flag in all its schools.Last month, the Delhi government presented its seventh annual budget and termed it a “deshbhakti budget”, in view of the nation celebrating 75th Independence Day this year. It announced a range of programmes and measures to evoke patriotism in citizens and finance minister Manish Sisodia also proposed ₹45 crore for installing the national flag at 500 different locations across Delhi.In a circular issued to the district education officers on Thursday, the Directorate of Education (DoE) said, “India will be celebrating her 75th Independence Day in 2021. In the budget speech, the finance minister set up a special component for deshbhakti and in order to make the occasion memorable, it has been decided to install the national flag at all schools run by the Delhi government. Accordingly, heads of all the government schools of Delhi are hereby directed to identify a suitable and conspicuous space to set up the flag mast.”Schools have been asked to identify 3-5 square metres of space near the “assembly grounds or at a suitable place on the top floor of the building where it is easily visible to all”. “In no case, the platform, thus identified, should obstruct a playground or any normal activity of the school,” the circular stated.“The normal size of the national flag which is hoisted on government/public utility service buildings is either 2X3 feet or 3X4 feet and the height of the mast which holds the tricolour is generally 10 feet or more,” it further said.Schools have been asked to identify the space by April 9. “The land and estate branch will coordinate with the PWD for construction of the national flag at all government school buildings in a timebound manner,” the circular added.Heads of several government schools welcomed the move. Devendra, principal of Sarvodaya Bal Vidyalaya in Rouse Avenue, said, “It’s good that the national flag will be installed at all government schools before the introduction of the Deshbhakti curriculum. We normally unfurl the flag at school only on the Independence Day and the Republic Day. But now it will be there throughout the year, encouraging students to contribute to the country. We have space on the rooftop and we will install our flag there.”Ajay Veer Singh, general secretary of the government schools’ teachers association, said, “It won’t be difficult for schools to spare 3 to 5 square metres space for the installation of the flag. All schools can, in fact, put up the flag on the rooftop to save on ground space.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi-govt-to-install-the-tricolour-in-all-its-schools-to-mark-75-years-of-independence-101617301139045.html
02-04-2021||Delhi||JNU teachers decry directive to recoup transport payment||The Jawaharlal Nehru University Teachers’ Association (JNUTA) on Thursday criticised the university administration for issuing a circular on recovery of transport allowance from staff members who did not attend office in person during the nationwide lockdown enforced in March last year to curb the Covid-19 spread.The circular, issued by the JNU administration on Wednesday, referred to an office memorandum by the Union finance ministry that said transport allowance was not payable to those who did not attend office for a whole calendar month during the lockdown period. The varsity circular also sought details of “physical attendance” of teaching and non-teaching staff from March 2020 to May 2020.In a statement on Thursday, the JNUTA said the administration should acknowledge the “hard work” put in by the faculty for continuing their duty since March 2020 without any break.“There are a number of other circulars that have been issued by the ministry of finance, which are of particular benefit to all employees, such as grant of advance/special festival package, or the special cash package equivalent in lieu of leave travel concession dated October 12, 2020. However, unlike the circular dealing with recovery of transport allowance, the university administration has not shown the same alacrity in dealing with matters that directly benefit all employees,” the teachers’ body said.When contacted, a senior university official said on condition of anonymity, “The circular was issued in accordance with the directions issued by the Union ministry of finance. The university has no role in it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/jnu-teachers-body-decries-move-by-varsity-to-recover-transport-allowance-given-during-lockdown-months-101617301138495.html
02-04-2021||Delhi||Man killed by family of seven after quarrel over ₹100 in Sadar Bazar||A quarrel over ₹100 cost a 21-year-old man his life after he was allegedly thrashed by a family of seven, including four minor siblings, and then slashed to death in north Delhi’s Sadar Bazar in the early hours of Tuesday, the police said.The seven members allegedly involved in the crime included a couple, their three daughters and son -- all four are minors – and a woman relative. All the adults have been arrested while the minors have been apprehended, said a senior police officer. Since the family allegedly involved in the murder includes minors, HT is not revealing their details as that could help identify the children.The victim, Manish Charan, lived with his mother and five siblings in Motia Khan neighbourhood of Sadar Bazar. His father died a few years ago and Charan, a courier delivery agent, was the primary earning member of the family.According to police, the problem began around 11 pm on Sunday when a man from their neighbourhood visited Charan’s mother, Geeta, with a ₹500 note and requested change. “I gave him a 200 rupee note and three 100 rupee notes,” said Geeta, a 60-year-old homemaker.Minutes later, the man returned to complain that Geeta had not given him the full change. “It could be possible that one of the currency notes was stained with Holi colours, but I am sure I gave him the full ₹500 in loose currency,” said Geeta.But the man was unwilling to believe her. “He insisted that he was paid ₹100 less and demanded the money,” said a senior police officer.Geeta stood her ground and the argument soon turned into a quarrel involving both families. Charan tried to defend his mother while the man’s wife, four minor children and a woman relative came to his defence.“The family manhandled my son, but neighbours intervened to separate them,” said Geeta. But by then, Charan happened to be in the centre of the quarrel.Though the quarrel ended then, the seven-member family returned a little after midnight on Tuesday to raise the issue again. “They barged into our house and pulled Charan out. They then kicked and punched my brother,” said the victim’s sister, Sarika.In the melee, the accused family allegedly got a meat cleaver from their home and slashed Charan. He sustained a deep wound in the thigh and started bleeding profusely even as the suspect family fled the spot. “After looking around for an auto-rickshaw for several minutes, we finally found a three-wheeler to take my son to Lady Hardinge Hospital where he died during treatment,” said Geeta.The police, meanwhile, learnt of the incident and reached the hospital, but Charan had died by then. They went on to register a case of murder and house trespass at Sadar Bazar police station.Anto Alphonse, deputy commissioner of police (north), said police quickly arrested the three adults and apprehended the four minor siblings for the murder.Last year, there were 472 murders in Delhi. Forty-four per cent of them were over enmity or disputes, while 21% were the result of sudden provocations and “trivial issues”. Almost 90% of the 472 were solved, the police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/man-killed-by-family-of-seven-after-quarrel-over-100-in-sadar-bazar-101617301079790.html

The school will operate with the principle of “anywhere living, anytime learning, anytime testing”.“Extensive work on remote learning carried out by Delhi teachers during the pandemic year has developed the system’s capacity in handling online education effectively and our teachers have also learned to use technology for teaching-learning purposes. This online teaching-learning during the pandemic has created a fertile ground for the establishment of the country’s first virtual school in Delhi,” said Sisodia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/doors-open-to-sportspersons-artists-at-proposed-virtual-school-101617301079132.html

02-04-2021||World||US caught the most migrants in two decades at Mexico border in March||US authorities caught more than 171,000 migrants at the US border with Mexico in March, according to preliminary data shared with Reuters, the highest monthly total in two decades and the latest sign of the mounting humanitarian challenge confronting President Joe Biden.The preliminary March arrest totals at the US-Mexico border represent the highest monthly level since April 2000, when border patrol agents caught more than 180,000 migrants.The total includes about 19,000 unaccompanied migrant children and 53,000 family members traveling together, the figures show. Single adults made up roughly 99,000 of the total.The Biden administration is struggling to house newly arrived unaccompanied children, who are exempted from expulsion under a Covid-19 health order known as Title 42. Children have been backed up in crowded border stations and processing centers for days.The shelter system that houses the children has been overwhelmed and US officials have scrambled in recent weeks to open emergency shelters, including sites in convention centers in Dallas and San Diego.Central American and Mexican migrants have made up the bulk of arrivals in recent months, in keeping with trends in recent years.The March figures show a 178% increase in the number of migrant families caught at the border compared with last month.While Biden said last week that the "vast majority" of families are being sent back to Mexico under Title 42, US government data suggests that is not the case.More than half of the 19,000 family members caught at the border in February were not expelled, according to public U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) data, with many released into the United States to pursue immigration court cases.Reuters also obtained three daily US border enforcement reports in March that showed only 14-16% of family members were expelled on those days.A CBP spokesman said official statistics would likely be released next week and declined to comment further.US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) spokeswoman Sarah Peck said last week that given fluctuating migration flows, "one day or week of statistics doesn’t reflect the full picture."Peck said the department's policy is still to expel families "and in situations where expulsion is not possible due to Mexico’s inability to receive the families, they are placed into removal proceedings."US border agents have encountered more repeat crossers in the past year compared with recent years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-caught-the-most-migrants-in-two-decades-at-mexico-border-in-march-101617386439687.html
02-04-2021||World||Coronavirus resurgence a bigger worry than inflation for US: Economic adviser||The United States is not at risk of a dangerous spell of inflation after a banner month of gains for workers, a top Biden economic official said on Friday, but the fast pace of business reopenings could cause a coronavirus resurgence."We must contain the virus in order to get the economy up and running, and people are seeing a lot more confidence," said Heather Boushey, a member of the White House's Council of Economic Advisers, after the administration ramped up vaccines and signed a $1.9 trillion stimulus bill."The question is are we moving too fast, too soon."A Labor Department report earlier on Friday showed the US economy creating the most jobs in seven months in March, a report that could mark the start of the strongest economic performance this year in decades.President Joe Biden's administration aggressively pushed a $1.9 trillion stimulus bill through Congress in his first weeks in office and is working towards a goal to have enough vaccine in stock to cover all of the country's adults by May.A new plan from the administration released Wednesday would add more than $2 trillion in additional spending on infrastructure and other jobs over the coming 8 years.Boushey said the administration has not yet produced its own estimate on how many jobs that effort would create because "it really does depend on how some of the details work out" as the administration negotiates with Congress. But she said a projection of the jobs that will be created will come "in the not-too-distant future."Biden said Friday some studies show it could create 19 million jobs.There is little sign that administration policies are leading to the economy overheating, she said."We start to be concerned about inflation overheating if we have too many dollars chasing not enough stuff, and right now we still have an unemployment rate of 6%," she said."There's a lot of slack in the labor market still. We're 8.4 million jobs fewer than where we were pre-pandemic."The administration remains cautious on whether states should be reopening as aggressively as they have been, warning governors that a spike in COVID-19 cases could ultimately derail the economy and the response to a pandemic that has killed more than half a million Americans.Nonfarm payrolls surged by 916,000 jobs last month, the biggest gain since last August, with data for prior months revised higher than initial reports.As of Tuesday morning, the United States had administered 147.6 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines in the country, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and most households were receiving $1,400 checks as a result of the stimulus bill Biden made his top priority on taking office in January.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-resurgence-a-bigger-worry-than-inflation-for-us-economic-adviser-101617385932145.html
02-04-2021||World||Covid-19: Fully vaccinated and want to travel in US? Here are key points you need to know||The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Friday announced revised travel guidelines for people fully vaccinated against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). The health agency said that vaccinated individuals can safely travel at "low risk", lifting the earlier guidance that advised all Americans to avoid non-essential travel. However, CDC director Rochelle Walensky, at a separate White House briefing, advocated against “general travel overall”.“Our guidance is silent on recommending or not recommending fully vaccinated people travel; our guidance speaks to the safety of doing so. If you are vaccinated, it’s lower risk,” said Walensky.The United States has administered more than 153 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines so far. Last week, US President Joe Biden announced a new vaccination goal of 200 million Covid-19 shots within his first 100 days in office.Here are key points of the latest travel guidelines released by CDC:1. People are considered fully vaccinated two weeks after their second dose in a 2-dose regimen, such as the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines, or two weeks after receiving a single-dose vaccine, such as Johnson & Johnson’s Janssen vaccine.2. Fully vaccinated travellers are less likely to get and spread Covid-19 and can travel safely within the United States.3. They do not need to get tested before or after the travel unless their destination requires it.4. Fully vaccinated travellers do not need to self-quarantine.5. People who have recovered from Covid-19 in the past 3 months do not need to get tested or self-quarantine.6. They should still follow CDC’s recommendations for safe travel, including wearing a mask over and staying 6 feet away from others.7. Fully vaccinated individuals should self-monitor for Covid-19 symptoms after travel and isolate and get tested if they develop symptoms.8. People with a condition or who are taking medication that weakens their immune system may not be fully protected even if they are fully vaccinated. Such individuals may need to continue taking all precautions even after getting fully vaccinated.9. Unvaccinated individuals should get tested 1-3 days before their trip.10. They should get also tested 3-5 days after travel and stay home and self-quarantine for a full 7 days after travel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-cdc-announces-revised-guidance-for-fully-vaccinated-people-10-points-101617383410410.html

After initial data from the older teens is reviewed, the trial will expand to add adolescents ages 12 to 15.J&J says the first teens are being enrolled in the United Kingdom and Spain. Teens in the United States, Canada and the Netherlands will be added, followed by teens in Brazil and Argentina.The study is testing the safety and efficacy of both one-dose and two-dose regimens of the vaccine, with the two-dose regimens being studied at intervals of one, two and three months after the first shot.Dr. Mathai Mammen, global head of research and development for the company’s Janssen pharmaceuticals unit, says it also expects to initiate studies in pregnant women and children.A total of 100 million J&J doses are pledged for the US by late May or June.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/johnson-johnson-starts-testing-covid-19-vaccine-on-teens-101617382971042.html

They haven’t been open since. Gyms, nail salons and barber shops have been shut almost as long. The mayor’s hair has grown so thick, it’s become a talking point on Twitter.When spring arrived, there was a glimmer of hope. Restaurants were allowed to set up outdoor patios; hair salons were told they could open on April 12. Those plans were canceled on Thursday when Ontario’s government invoked a four-week “emergency brake” that tightens restrictions again and extends them across the province of 14.7 million people.Ontario Premier Doug Ford, a conservative elected in 2018 with strong support from business, pleaded for understanding. The virus left him with no choice, he said. “This decision weighs extremely heavy on me,” he said. “I know what this means for people, to be here over a year into this pandemic. It’s frustrating and it’s very, very difficult.”For some business owners, “difficult” has turned to desperation. They’re chafing at the interminable restrictions and the slow pace of Canada’s vaccine program. In a national survey of companies released in March, 10% of firms said they could carry on for less than 12 months at current levels of revenue and expenses.Only 13.3% of the Canadian population has received at least one Covid-19 shot. In the U.S., it’s 30%, according to the Bloomberg Vaccine Tracker.Read more: Vaccine Trickle Becomes Torrent as U.S. Eligibility Rules WidenPrime Minister Justin Trudeau has set a goal of vaccinating every adult by September. In the meantime, the Canada-U.S. border remains closed to most travelers, as it has been for more than a year, threatening airlines, hotels and tourism businesses with a second barren summer.“The mood of the business community has shifted dramatically,” said Dan Kelly, chief executive officer of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, a small-business lobby group. It’s gone from acceptance of necessary measures to “rage” at government, he said.At lunchtime on a recent weekday, a signboard outside Chotto Matte, a Japanese-Peruvian restaurant across the street from Royal Bank of Canada’s headquarters, declared the patio open for dining. Not a person was seated there, despite sunny and warm spring weather.Wall Street firms may be planning to bring back many staff to the office soon, but on Toronto’s Bay Street, the scene is quiet and is almost certain to remain that way for most of 2021.At Bank of Montreal’s headquarters, less than 10% of staff have been coming into the office regularly over the past year. Most of those working from home will stay there until vaccines are broadly available, Mona Malone, Bank of Montreal’s chief human resources officer, said in an interview.In the long run, Malone expects the bank will adopt a hybrid model, with some employees staying home part of the time. “People do miss the connectivity with their colleagues, but it’s going to be different,” Malone said. “They won’t be returning to a pre-Covid-type experience.”Toronto’s banks adapted quickly to the pandemic and are now earning bigger profits than before Covid-19 as the Canadian housing market soars. But the small businesses that surround them are beginning to snap.Tom Antonarakis owns two seafood restaurants in downtown Toronto and is looking to offload them at a reduced price. Both are in food courts that rely on a lunch crowd of office workers.“I’m in the process of trying to sell those two locations almost 30 cents to the dollar,” Antonarakis said. “We tried opening up after the first lockdown, and then they closed us down again.” He also sold one of his two food trucks and has been operating the other out of a mall in the suburbs.Ford and his top officials acknowledge the financial pain but say the numbers justify extending restrictions.Ontario has seen about 160 new virus cases daily per million population over the past week. That’s far fewer than neighboring Michigan and New York and still well below the peak of the province’s second wave.But Ontario hospitals hit a new high for Covid-19 patients in intensive care this week. The problem is a new variant of the virus, known as B.1.1.7, that is making people sicker.“It’s spreading far more quickly than it was before and we cannot vaccinate quickly enough to break this third wave,” Adalsteinn Brown, a doctor who is co-chair of the Ontario Covid-19 Science Advisory Table, said at a news conference Thursday.Politics are a significant factor too, according to Nelson Wiseman, a professor of political science at the University of Toronto.Ford got high marks from voters for decisive action early in the pandemic. He’s fearful of being seen as overruling the advice of the medical community, Wiseman said. Toronto’s top doctor, Eileen de Villa, has been a consistent advocate of strict measures including indoor dining bans.“The guy was scared stiff at first and has rolled over,” Wiseman said in an interview. “Our authorities have taken the advice of their medical officers, unlike Houston, unlike Miami, places like that.”The Ford and Trudeau governments have offered an array of grants and loans to help businesses that have been hurt by Covid-19 restrictions. But it isn’t enough for companies whose revenue depends on activities that are now banned.“It’s been a long road and going on 25 weeks of being shutdown,” said Liz Clark, owner of Chair Decor, a linen supplier for events. “The subsidies they have been providing are helping, but we are still bleeding money every day. We have a burn rate of C$10,000 a month.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/gruelling-covid-19-lockdown-has-toronto-businesses-at-the-breaking-point-101617382893839.html
02-04-2021||World||Dispute over Pentagon funds part of White House budget delay||The Pentagon and the White House budget office have been at odds over the first defense budget under President Joe Biden.The disagreement may be at least partly to blame for delays in releasing the budget outline that was widely expected this week, according to two people familiar with the situation who asked not to be named because the information isn’t public.The Pentagon has been crafting a fiscal 2022 budget plan that assumes the military will receive $704 billion to $708 billion, essentially a flat budget instead of the increase anticipated under former President Donald Trump.The White House didn’t provide specifics on when it would release its budget priorities. “I know it’ll be out soon,” White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said Thursday.Robert Friedlander, a spokesman for the Office of Management and Budget said the document would be released “soon.” Two people familiar with the process said the budget preview wouldn’t be released until next week.The Pentagon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The Trump administration had planned to propose about $722 billion for the Defense Department in the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1 -- although lawmakers of both parties have predicted less would be available amid competing spending demands and rising deficits from coronavirus relief packages.The Pentagon-only budget doesn’t include defense spending that goes to other agencies, primarily to the Energy Department, which maintains the nation’s nuclear weapons.Decrease in Real TermsA “topline” of $704 billion to $708 billion under Biden would amount to a decrease of about 2% in real terms, adjusting for inflation from this year’s enacted appropriation of about $704 billion. The topline proposed by the OMB is still unclear.Lawmakers are also expected to focus on how much of the Pentagon funds come from the Overseas Contingency Operations account, or OCO, a separate pool of money that funds Afghanistan and Iraq operations and personnel costs. The last Trump plan earmarked a $20 billion placeholder figure.The topline considered by the Pentagon is in contrast to real growth in the budget of 3% to 5% first endorsed by then-Defense Secretary Jim Mattis in 2017, then by the National Defense Strategy Commission in 2018 and by a group of GOP defense hawks led by Representative Mike Rogers of Alabama, the top Republican on the House Armed Services Committee.Democrats Split on SpendingDemocrats face a wide rift over defense spending. In a March 16 letter to Biden, 50 progressive Democrats, including Representatives Ro Khanna of California and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, suggested cuts of more than 10% to the Pentagon budget.“While we are heartened that your administration is not contemplating expanding the Pentagon’s already inflated budget, our new Democratic majorities in Congress along with your administration should go further,” they wrote. “Rather than requesting a flat Pentagon budget, we urge you to seek a significantly reduced Pentagon topline.”Senator Bernie Sanders, the Vermont independent who now leads the Budget Committee, has long called for cutting the defense budget by 10%.Pentagon personnel were working under “not to exceed” guidance from the Office of Management and Budget, rather than the formal “passback”--a back-and-forth process between Pentagon and OMB that sets the budget specifics.The fiscal 2022 budget will be the first in a decade in which defense and non-defense spending aren’t constrained by budget caps, meaning that Congress has an opening to shift funds from defense to non-defense spending, or the reverse.Congressional math is likely to prevent Democrats from taking a scalpel to the Pentagon’s budget. Senate committees are evenly split between Democrats and Republicans, so every proposal would have to attract Republican votes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dispute-over-pentagon-funds-part-of-white-house-budget-delay-101617381896760.html

Three patients had extensive pulmonary embolisms. One died and one also had a brain haemorrhage," it said.Roughly 400,000 people were vaccinated with AstraZeneca in the Netherlands in the period and the reports "seem comparable to other reports in Europe," Lareb said.It came a day after Germany halted use of the vaccine for people under 60 and a death was reported in the Netherlands of a woman between the ages of 25 and 65 who had received the AstraZeneca vaccine.The Netherlands has recorded about 1.2 million coronavirus cases in total and more than 16,500 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/netherlands-halts-use-of-astrazeneca-vaccine-for-people-under-60-101617382098308.html
02-04-2021||World||England Covid-19 reproduction rate steady at 0.8 to 1 : Report||The estimated Covid-19 reproduction number in England could be as high as 1, official figures showed on Friday, although the pandemic is still thought to be shrinking.This week, strict lockdown restrictions in England began to be eased for the first time since the start of the year as the number of deaths, hospitalisations and cases has steadily fallen.The Department of Health said scientists could not agree to a nationwide figure for the reproduction "R" number or daily growth estimate in Covid-19 cases, but the estimated figures for England remained unchanged.In England, the R number was estimated between 0.8 to 1.0, meaning that, on average, every 10 people infected will infect between 8 and 10 others, a figure unchanged from last week. A figure above 1 suggests the disease is growing.The figures showed the daily growth rate of infections in England was between -4% to 0%, meaning the number of new infections was shrinking by between 0% and 4% each day, also the same rate as recorded the previous week.Health chiefs had cautioned progress in limiting infection would slow after millions of children returned to school at the start of March, although the Office for National Statistics said on Thursday an estimated 1 in 370 people in England had Covid-19 last week, the lowest share since mid-September and compared with 1 in 340 in the previous week.The R number has been used a guide to the state of the pandemic but the health ministry said the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE) had not agreed figures for the whole of the United Kingdom this week."Given the increasingly localised approach to managing the epidemic, particularly between nations, UK-level estimates are less meaningful than previously and may not accurately reflect the current picture of the epidemic," the ministry said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/england-covid-19-reproduction-rate-steady-at-0-8-to-1-report-101617380657717.html
02-04-2021||World||India pitches for further easing of oil production cuts by OPEC+||India on Friday pushed for further easing of oil production cuts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and 10 more countries, saying high crude prices were affecting consumption-led recovery around the world. OPEC+, which includes the 10 additional oil exporting countries led by Russia, agreed on Thursday to gradually ease oil output cuts from May in response to the US administration’s call for ensuring that energy remains affordable for consumers. The group, which comprises 13 major crude producers such as Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Iran, put in place deep cuts after oil prices collapsed in 2020 due to the Covid-19 crisis. The group has now agreed to ease production curbs by 350,000 barrels per day (bpd) in May, 350,000 bpd in June and around 400,000 bpd in July. “We have noted that OPEC and OPEC+ have announced a slight easing of crude production cuts, even though it is still far below the originally announced schedule of cuts,” external affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi told a regular news briefing. India, he said, has been appealing to the crude oil producing countries since the beginning of this year to ease crude oil production cuts announced last year because “high crude prices hurt the consumption-led recovery of several countries, including India”, he said. “Crude supply should be market determined rather than artificially managed. Our ministry of petroleum and natural gas is reviewing closely the global crude supplies and price situation,” Bagchi added. In addition to rising crude prices, India has been hit by the stopping of oil imports from Iran because of US sanctions imposed by the previous Donald Trump administration. In recent weeks, India has mulled the possibility of organising diplomatic efforts by oil-consuming countries against OPEC+ as producers have kept crude prices artificially high by restricting supply. India has also begun looking at the possibility of resuming imports of cheaper energy from Iran and Venezuela to counter the oil cartel. The restriction of supplies by OPEC+ has become a major concern for New Delhi as it tries to boost economic recovery in the post-pandemic period. India is the third largest oil consumer in the world, after the US and China.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-pitches-for-further-easing-of-oil-production-cuts-by-opec-101617380765161.html

These decreases in people-to-people contact are already paying off," said the mayor.The occupancy rate of intensive care beds in the city remains at over 90 percent, as Brazil battles its toughest phase of the outbreak so far.March was the deadliest month for Brazil since the pandemic first started, with 66,573 deaths -- more than double the previous record set in July 2020.Brazil's death toll of over 325,000 is second only to that of the United States with more than half-a-million.Rio de Janeiro state, with more than 37,000 dead, has a mortality rate of 215 per 100,000 inhabitants, higher than the national average of 141.Paes said schools in Rio city will reopen for in-person lessons on Tuesday.But non-essential business -- bars and restaurants, cinemas, museums and theaters included -- will not be allowed to reopen before Friday, and then with restricted hours.The city's famous beaches will remain off limits until April 19, when a daily curfew from 11:00 pm to 05:00 am will also be lifted and dance clubs reopened.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brazils-rio-de-janeiro-city-extends-covid-19-restrictions-101617380105771.html

Opportunity is coming. And at long last, there's hope for so many families."The economy regained 916,000 jobs last month, the largest increase since August, pushing the unemployment rate down to 6.0 percent from 6.2 percent in February.Biden gave credit for the encouraging figures to his $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan, the third major relief bill passed by Congress to help consumers and businesses after the Covid-19 crisis caused a massive economic downturn."We're going continue to implement that law in the weeks ahead. By April 7, next week, over 130 million households will have gotten their $1,400 per person rescue check," he said."Funds are on their way to local communities to put educators, health care workers, home health care aides, police, firefighters, sanitary workers back on the job."However, even as the economy begins to recover from the Covid-19 shutdowns, employment is still 8.4 million jobs lower than the pre-pandemic peak, the jobs report said.In addition, there are nearly six million more workers now than before the crisis who are working part time because they cannot find a full time position, or are on the sidelines because they have not been able to find work.After a slow start, the US vaccination campaign has gathered pace since late January and Biden has promised that 90 percent of America's adults will eligible for a vaccine by April 19.The president urged Americans to keep up their guard against Covid-19, despite the optimism fueled by the vaccination drive."I plead with you. Don't give back the progress we've all fought so hard to achieve... We need to finish this job," he said."We need every American to buckle down and keep their guard up in this homestretch."He implored people to continuing wearing masks, and maintain social distancing and hand washing."Get vaccinated when it's your turn. That's how we're going to beat the virus," he added.

They raised overall fatalities in Russia linked to the epidemic to 225,572 after the death toll for January was revised up slightly.President Vladimir Putin opted against a return to lockdown as cases began to rise late last year, helping cushion the economic impact of the pandemic but contributing to the third-most deaths globally after the U.S. and Brazil.The health crisis has eased recently, with the number of new daily infections currently under 10,000 from nearly 30,000 at the end of December, the deadliest month of the pandemic.Russia remains well behind many other nations in its vaccination campaign, sparking fears of a third wave of Covid-19 infections. Only about 4.3% of the population has had a first dose of vaccine, compared to 11% in Turkey, 30% in the U.S. and nearly half of the U.K.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-says-february-covid-19-toll-is-nearly-double-early-count-101617380189450.html

All you need to know||Nasa’s InSight lander detected two strong, clear quakes on Mars last month, recording over 500 quakes to date since its touch down on the Red Planet in November 2018. According to the mission control, the two quakes of magnitude 3.3 and 3.1 originated in a region called Cerberus Fossae, the same place where two other strong quakes were recorded earlier in the mission. The previous strong marsquakes were of magnitude 3.6 and 3.5.Nasa’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory said that the quakes further supported the idea that Cerberus Fossae is seismically active. “InSight has recorded over 500 quakes to date, but because of their clear signals, these are four of the best quake records for probing the interior of the planet,” Nasa JPL said in a statement.InSight science team seeks to develop a better understanding of Mars’ mantle and core by studying the quakes. Mars doesn’t have tectonic plates like Earth but it does have volcanically active regions that can shake the surface, as per the US space agency.Also Read | Nasa shares pic of nighttime view of ship traffic jam on Suez CanalTaichi Kawamura of France’s Institut de Physique du Globe de Paris, which helped provide InSight’s seismometer, said in a statement that the mission has observed two different types of marsquakes. According to Kawamura, one type of marsquake was more “Moon-like”, which tends to be very scattered, while the other type was more “Earth-like”, where waves travel more directly through the planet.“Interestingly, all four of these larger quakes, which come from Cerberus Fossae, are ‘Earth-like,’” Kawamura added, according to the Nasa JPL website.The mission noted another common feature between the latest marsquakes and the previous top seismic events which occurred almost a full Martian year ago - all of them occurred in the Martian northern summer. Scientists had predicted that Martian northern summer, when winds would become calmer, would be an ideal time to listen for quakes as the wind causes enough vibration to obscure some marsquakes.I’m getting ready for one of my next activities: burying the tether that runs out to my seismometer. I’ve done some test scrapes, and soon I’ll start scooping material to begin covering it. pic.twitter.com/ZDJ9GrRup8The mission team has started trying to partially insulate the cable, that connects the seismometer to the lander, from extreme temperature variations. The scoop on the end of InSight’s robotic arm is being used to drop soil on top of the domed Wind and Thermal Shield which subsequently trickle down onto the cable.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nasas-insight-lander-has-recorded-over-500-quakes-on-mars-all-you-need-to-know-101617378481937.html

You saw the Galwan incident, how many soldiers lost their lives. Tibet is just a beginning as it is the palm but five fingers are still out there which Chinese CPC (Chinese Communist Party) is trying hard to get," claimed Lobsang, president of the Central Tibetan Administration (Tibetan government-in exile).The Five Fingers of Tibet is a Chinese foreign policy that considers Tibet to be the palm of China's right hand, with five fingers on its periphery: Ladakh, Nepal, Sikkim, Bhutan, and Arunachal Pradesh, and that it is China's responsibility to "liberate" these regions."India needs to understand, what is happening in Tibet is the blueprint and it is happening in Xinjiang and Hong Kong. Understand China and deal with it," Lobsang said.He said pluralism and diversity, human rights and freedom binds India together."Pluralism is the foundation of India. Pluralism and diversity binds India together, human rights and freedom binds India together but China is bringing a more autocratic system so for Asia - development with democracy and diversity is better than the Chinese model," he said.Lobsang also alleged that Chinese expansionist policies are a "threat" to the world community."... Therefore the world community must wake up to its designs sooner than later. Standing against China in relation to its record on human rights violations of minorities in Tibet and Xinjiang is not in the control of one country or a small group of countries but the whole world community needs to stand in solidarity," he said.He further claimed that in the name of poverty alleviation, the Chinese government is employing mainland Chinese discourses in minority regions such as Tibet thereby creating an environment which might lead to endangering of Tibetan identity."Not authoritarian policies of China but democratic policies for development that respect diversity is what the world needs," he said.He highlighted that India's model of development with democracy is better than Chinese model of development without democracy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tibet-occupation-just-beginning-china-trying-hard-to-get-five-fingers-lobsang-sangay-101617375624215.html

The new CDC guidance specifically greenlights vaccinated grandparents getting on airplanes to see grandchildren.A group representing major US airlines including American Airlines, Delta Air lines, United Airlines Southwest Airlines and other trade groups on March 22 had urged the CDC to immediately update its guidance to say "vaccinated individuals can travel safely."The new guidance will also say fully vaccinated people do not need to get a Covid-19 test before or after travel and do not need to self-quarantine after travel.The CDC said grandparents that have been fully vaccinated can fly to visit grandkids without getting a Covid-19 test or self-quarantining as long as they follow CDC advice for traveling safely.But the administration is not lifting restrictions that bar most-non US citizens from the United States who have recently been in China, Brazil, South Africa and most of Europe. It is also keeping requirements that nearly all international U.S. air visitors getting a negative Covid-19 test before traveling to the United States.The CDC did not revise guidance for non-vaccinated people."Vaccines can help us return to the things we love about life, so we encourage every American to get vaccinated as soon as they have the opportunity," CDC director Rochelle Walensky said in a statementThe CDC's new guidance says fully vaccinated people do not need Covid-19 tests before international travel unless it is required by the international destination and vaccinated people returning from foreign travel do not need to self-quarantine after returning to the United States, unless required by state or local authorities.The CDC had repeatedly declined in recent weeks to change the guidance and repeated it was still discouraging all non-essential travel because of a concern about new variants.Many Americans have not been heeding the CDC's advice. The Transportation Security Administration screened 1.56 million people at US airports, just below Sunday's 1.57 million, which was the highest daily total since March 2020. The last time the number of airport passengers screened was below 1 million was March 10.The Biden administration has taken steps to reduce international travel and mandated masks in nearly all forms of public transit. The administration is not eliminating any mask rules.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-vaccinated-people-can-resume-travel-at-low-risk-says-us-cdc-101617376787690.html

But we believe this is a healthy step forward," State Department spokesman Ned Price said."We do not anticipate presently that there will be direct talks between the United States and Iran through this process, though the United States remains open to them," he said.The European Union announced Friday an in-person meeting in Vienna of all parties to the 2015 nuclear deal, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, from which former president Donald Trump withdrew.The Europeans said it would have "separate" contacts in Vienna with the United States and Iran quickly rejected a direct meeting with its arch-enemy as it presses President Joe Biden first to lift sanctions.Price said that the "primary issues" for discussion in Vienna will be "the nuclear steps that Iran would need to take in order to return to compliance with the terms of the JCPOA, and the sanctions relief steps that the United States would need to take in order to return to compliance as well."Iran has insisted that the United States must act first on removing the Trump sanctions, which include a unilateral effort to stop all its oil exports, before it will roll back measures away from compliance that it had taken as a protest.The Vienna talks will also include the governments of Britain, China, France, Germany and Russia which all remain parties and supporters of the nuclear deal negotiated under former US president Barack Obama.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-open-to-direct-talks-with-iran-at-nuclear-meet-101617372306275.html

We had to save the person. We did everything at the highest level," surgeon Valentin Filatov was quoted as saying by REN TV. He said it had been a heart by-pass operation.The ministry said 128 people were immediately evacuated from the hospital as the fire broke out on the roof."The clinic was built more than a century ago, in 1907, and the fire spread like lightning through the wooden ceilings of the roof," the ministry said.No one was reported hurt."A bow to the medics and firefighters," said Vasiliy Orlov, the local regional governor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russian-doctors-complete-open-heart-surgery-as-tsarist-era-hospital-burns-101617372474570.html

Important dates||The first scheduled flight of Nasa's Ingenuity helicopter on Mars will take place no earlier than April 11, the space agency’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) announced on Thursday. The Ingenuity helicopter, a technology experiment and companion of Nasa’s Perseverance rover, was previously slated to take off no sooner than April 8. It will be the first aircraft to attempt controlled flight on another planet, a feat with a high degree of difficulty.“Come fly with us. Mars Helicopter is preparing to do something that's never been done: controlled, powered flight on another planet. Takeoff is now slated for no earlier than April 11, with data arriving on Earth on April 12,” tweeted Nasa JPL.Come fly with us. #MarsHelicopter is preparing to do something that's never been done: controlled, powered flight on another planet. Takeoff is now slated for no earlier than April 11, with data arriving on Earth on April 12. https://t.co/TNCdXWcKWE pic.twitter.com/JSep5lcKhROne of the first objectives of the helicopter was to survive the frigid Martian night, given the nights at the Red planet are as cold as minus 90 degrees Celsius. The other capabilities it needs to prove before it can take off and land include autonomously keeping warm and charging itself with its solar panel. The rover will continue to assist in communications related to the helicopter’s commissioning and flight test campaign back and forth from Earth.The Perseverance rover dropped a debris shield on March 21 that protected Ingenuity during landing and made its way to the "airfield" where the helicopter will attempt its flights. The rover has been slowly releasing the helicopter on the Martian surface. On Tuesday, Nasa JPL shared a photograph of Ingenuity with all four legs reaching out.“We’re in the home stretch. The Mars Helicopter has lowered all four legs and is in position to touch down on the Martian surface. Once it’s fully ready, NASA Perseverance will release it gently to the surface,” JPL tweeted.An interactive webinar preview of the flight will be held at 11:00pm IST on April 5 via Zoom, a video-conferencing platform. Experts will come together to discuss the helicopter at 10:30pm IST on April 8 which will be streamed on the YouTube channel of Nasa JPL’s Education Office.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nasa-ingenuity-helicopter-s-first-flight-on-mars-delayed-important-dates-101617370346406.html
02-04-2021||World||US: 7 Texas officers fired after custodial death of Black inmate||Seven officers involved in the in-custody death of a Black jail inmate in Texas whose family members say may have been suffering a mental health crisis have been fired, a sheriff said.The detention officers violated sheriff's office policies and procedures leading up to the death of Marvin Scott III, Collin County Sheriff Jim Skinner said in a news release Thursday. An eighth officer resigned.Scott, 26, was arrested March 14 at an outlet mall in Allen on a marijuana possession charge, authorities have said. Allen officers took Scott to a hospital because he was reportedly acting erratically. Scott was released and police took him to the county jail.While at the jail, Scott began to exhibit “some strange behaviour,” Skinner said at a March 19 news conference. Detention officers placed Scott on a restraint bed, used pepper spray and covered his face with a spit mask. Scott became unresponsive at some point and later was pronounced dead at a hospital.Law enforcement's use of face coverings such as spit hoods on people — and the frequent reliance on police to respond to mental health emergencies — drew new attention last year following Daniel Prude’s suffocation in Rochester, New York. The mesh coverings have been linked to other deaths.In Texas, the Collin County medical examiner’s office has not yet released a cause of death for Scott. The Texas Rangers were continuing to investigate Scott’s death, according to Skinner’s statement.Family members have said that Scott had schizophrenia and may have been suffering a mental health crisis. Scott’s family has hired a forensic pathologist to conduct an independent autopsy.Civil rights lawyer Lee Merritt, who is representing Scott's family, has said he thinks Scott was jailed for marijuana possession because he was Black and viewed as a criminal rather than as someone in crisis.Names and races of the officers haven’t been released.A statement Thursday by Merritt noted that Scott's funeral was Wednesday.“Just one day after the funeral of Marvin Scott III, the Collin County Sheriff has fired seven detention officers in connection with his death,” the statement said. “We are pleased with this decision and consider this progress.”The statement also asks that the fired officers “be arrested and brought to justice.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-7-texas-officers-fired-after-custodial-death-of-black-inmate-101617370235320.html

At the time, Canal officials said that more than 420 ships had been waiting for the Panama-flagged, Japanese-owned ship Ever Given to be freed so they could make the crossing.Leth Agencies said that a total of 357 vessels have crossed the Canal since the ship was re-floated by a flotilla of tugboats, helped by the tides.The Ever Given had crashed into a bank of a single-lane stretch of the canal about 6 kilometers (3.7 miles) north of the southern entrance, near the city of Suez. That forced some ships to take the long, alternate route around the Cape of Good Hope at Africa’s southern tip — a 5,000-kilometer (3,100-mile) detour that costs ships hundreds of thousands of dollars in fuel and other costs. Others waited in place for the blockage to be over.The unprecedented shutdown, which raised fears of extended delays, goods shortages and rising costs for consumers, added to strain on the shipping industry, already under pressure from the coronavirus pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/traffic-jam-eases-further-in-suez-canal-after-ship-unblocked-says-report-101617368630350.html

After Trump’s withdrawal from the agreement, Iran breached some of the limits that it placed on its nuclear program.“The members considered the prospect of the United States’ full return to the JCPOA and emphasized their readiness to investigate the issue with a positive outlook and with collective effort,” Iran’s foreign ministry said in a statement after Friday’s meeting, using the abbreviation for the deal, or Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action.Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said a follow-up meeting would take place in Vienna on Tuesday. His deputy, Abbas Araghchi, said the Iranian delegation would not negotiate with their US counterparts “at any level” during Tuesday’s talks, the semi-official Fars news agency reported.‘The right track’China on Friday called for the US to lift all “illegal” sanctions on Iran, saying the country’s nuclear issue was at a “critical stage.” Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying blamed Washington’s unilateral exit from the Iran deal as the “root cause” of the problem, while saying China welcomes the return of the US. Russia’s envoy to the UN’s atomic agency, Mikhail Ulyanov, wrote in a tweet: “The impression is that we are on the right track but the way ahead will not be easy.”“There’s no time to lose,” German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said in a statement. “A fully respected agreement would be an advantage for the security of the region, and the best basis for talks about other important aspects of regional stability.”US State Department spokesman Ned Price told reporters on Thursday that Washington welcomed the European effort as a positive step. He said the US was ready to return to compliance with the 2015 agreement “consistent with” Iran doing the same and has been exploring “the best way to achieve this, including through a series of mutual, initial steps.”“We have been looking at options for doing so, including with indirect conversations through our mutual European partners,” Price said.Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said this month that his nation was in “no hurry” to revive the nuclear deal and said US policy was doomed to fail unless sanctions against the Islamic Republic were first removed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/parties-to-iran-nuclear-deal-plan-talks-in-vienna-next-week-101617367999109.html

They said many Russians remain unaware of the scope of human rights violations and war crimes even though Moscow has waged military action in Syria since 2015.Russia's military involvement has shored up Syrian President Bashar Assad's rule and allowed his government to reclaim control over much of the country.“The ongoing violence in Syria and the continued failure to secure justice for those harmed make it more critical than ever that the Russian public is informed about the grave human rights abuses that have occurred in Syria over the last decade, including those committed under Russia’s watch and, since 2015, with its participation,” the report said.The authors wrote that the Syrian government's military operations conducted jointly or with support from the Russian air force had a “clear pattern of indiscriminate and targeted attacks that did not correspond to the presence of military targets.” The Russian military has staunchly denied striking Syrian civilians.Given Moscow's role in keeping Assad in power, the activists urged the Russian government to “use its influence on Syrian authorities to end arbitrary arrests, torture and degrading treatment in prisons, extrajudicial killings, and enforced disappearances...(and) support the immediate release of those arbitrarily detained and reveal the fates of the disappeared."They also called on Russian civil society to build contacts with the Syrian public to conduct joint investigations and prevent rights abuses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/human-rights-violated-in-syria-under-moscow-s-watch-russian-activists-101617367606881.html
02-04-2021||World||US job growth accelerates in March; unemployment rate falls to 6.0%||US employers hired more workers than expected in March, spurred by increased vaccinations and more pandemic relief money from the government, cementing expectations that an economic boom was underway.Nonfarm payrolls surged by 916,000 jobs last month, the Labor Department said on Friday. That was be the biggest gain since last August. Data for February was revised higher to show 468,000 jobs created instead of the previously reported 379,000.Economists polled by Reuters had forecast payrolls increasing by 647,000 jobs in March. The unemployment rate fell to 6.0% last month from 6.2% in February. The unemployment rate has been understated by people misclassifying themselves as being "employed but absent from work."The closely watched employment report marked a painful anniversary for the labor market. The March 2020 employment report was the first to reflect the mandatory closures of non-essential businesses such as restaurants, bars and gyms to slow the onset of the just-emerging Covid-19 pandemic.Nearly 1.7 million jobs were lost that month, and another 20.7 million would vanish in April. Economists estimate it could take at least two years to recoup the more than 22 million jobs lost during the pandemic.As of Tuesday morning, the United States had administered 147.6 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines in the country and distributed 189.5 million doses, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The White House's massive $1.9 trillion pandemic relief package approved in March is sending additional $1,400 checks to qualified households and fresh funding for businesses.Economists expect job growth will average at least 700,000 per month in the second and third quarters. That, combined with the fiscal stimulus and about $19 trillion in excess savings accumulated by households during the pandemic, is expected to unleash a powerful wave of pent-up demand.First-quarter gross domestic product estimates are as high as a 10.0% annualized rate. The economy grew at a 4.3% pace in the fourth quarter. Growth this year could top 7%, which would be the fastest since 1984. The economy contracted 3.5% in 2020, the worst performance in 74 years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-job-growth-accelerates-in-march-unemployment-rate-falls-to-60-101617367440211.html
02-04-2021||World||White House trying to craft Biden's gun executive orders that can't be undone||The White House is trying to craft a series of executive actions for President Joe Biden to sign to try to limit gun violence, hoping they cannot be quickly dismantled in court, according to aides and gun safety groups.Among the measures being considered - and strongly encouraged by activists - is one directing the Department of Justice (DOJ) to reinterpret existing law on untraceable "ghost guns."So-called "ghost gun" kits are self-assembled from parts purchased online or at gun shows and are increasingly associated with crimes. But they are not classified as firearms and so can be legally sold without serial numbers or background checks.The U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives has said more than 30% of the illegal weapons it has confiscated in some areas of California are ghost guns.Changing the designation of such weapons would likely set off an instant legal challenge, as have other attempts to limit gun ownership in recent years, for instance former President Donald Trump's December 2018 ban on "bump stocks."Two top White House aides, Cedric Richmond and Susan Rice, held a series of meetings early in the Biden administration to begin soliciting views on gun violence policy from safety activists and community leaders. Justice Department officials have met with the gun industry.Among the topics discussed, according to attendees, were "ghost guns", pushing the DOJ to bring more cases against firearms dealers and manufacturers, limiting exemptions for private sales from background check rules, and alerting local law enforcement when someone fails a federal background check.Mass shootings last month in Georgia and Colorado have put pressure on the White House to act, as swift legislation is not likely through Congress. Press secretary Jen Psaki reiterated on Thursday that the administration is looking at executive orders.Police say the deadly shootings at spas in the Atlanta area and a supermarket in Boulder were carried out by suspects using legally-purchased firearms.Biden has said the administration is exploring whether he has the authority to take action on firearms made using 3D printers as well as on imported guns."We stand ready and all options are on the table," said Amy Hunter, a spokeswoman for the pro-gun National Rifle Association, when asked about the possibility of presidential executive orders.White House and Department of Justice lawyers are working to anticipate a raft of legal challenges, aides and allies said.The gun lobby is "a litigious group and will potentially take action in court - but their track record with litigation is remarkably poor," said Nick Suplina, managing director for law and policy at Everytown for Gun Safety Action Fund Inc, an advocacy group that works with the administration."We're optimistic that we will see action from the White House in the near future."The Department of Justice needs to create a paper trail to show that any rule change was not abrupt or political, that it has a strong foundation in law, and that officials followed a reasoned and orderly process before making the change, lawyers and activists say."They are talking about the levers that they have to address gun violence," said Christian Heyne, vice president of policy at the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, a group that has met with White House. "That's reflected in some of the meetings they had."The administration is also studying previous legal challenges from the gun industry, like the one that followed Trump's ban on "bump stocks." The devices, which enable semiautomatic weapons to fire in rapid, sustained bursts, were used in the October 2017 mass shooting at a Las Vegas concert that killed 60 and wounded more than 400.The Supreme Court has allowed that ban to go into effect as lawsuits continue in lower courts to try to overturn it.A group of 18 state attorneys general have called on Biden's Justice Department chief Merrick Garland to close what they consider the legal loophole on "ghost guns" himself.Absent congressional legislation that cements any U.S. presidents' executive orders or other policies into law, the conservative-leaning Supreme Court could have the final say.Last June it sidestepped a major gun ruling, however, by dismissing a challenge to restrictions on handgun owners in New York City and also turned down a slew of other cases seeking to expand gun rights.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/white-house-trying-to-craft-biden-s-gun-executive-orders-that-can-t-be-undone-101617366057450.html
02-04-2021||World||China ATM numbers shrink as more opt for cashless payments||China’s blistering growth in digital payments could gradually make the ubiquitous ATMs or “automated teller machines” irrelevant in the second largest economy in the world. As of the end of 2020, the number of ATM machines in China was 1.0139 million units, a decrease of 83,900 from the end of 2019, new data showed, adding that the number of ATMs per 10,000 people nationwide was 7.24, a year-on-year decrease of 7.95%.The decline in the number of ATM units in China began in 2018 but the rate rapidly increased last year. The fall in ATM number has been driven by businesses switching over to accepting online payment spurred by Covid-19 pandemic while vendors and fruit stores have increased their online and offline payment integration.In comparison, the total number of ATMs in India stood at 234,244 by the end of September 2020, marginally down from 234,357 in March 2020, according to the Reserve Bank of India data, quoted by fortuneindia.com in January this year.While industry reports say the first ATM was unveiled in China in 1985, the Bank of China, one of the country’s leading banks, says it issued the first ATM card in 1987.China’s push towards the use of digital yuan, its own digital currency, could further shrink those numbers in the coming years.Data from the People’s Bank of China (PBOC), quoted by thepaper.cn, showed a sharp increase in non-cash payments in 2020. “According to data released by the central bank, in 2020, banks across the country handled a total of 354.621 billion non-cash payment services,” the article said.The amount of money involved in non-cash payments, including commercial papers, bank cards and online payment vehicles, totaled 4013.01 trillion yuan (about $613.84 trillion) last year, up 6.18% year-on-year, according to the PBOC.The country had 854 million online payment users as of December last year, an increase of more than 86 million since March 2020, said a report from the China Internet Network Information Centre.Results of a financial survey carried out last year but released in February showed that mobile payment penetration continues to rise in China as more consumers go digital.“In 2020, 98% of the 65,000 surveyed listed mobile payments as their most commonly used channel, up 5 percentage points from the previous year,” according to the report jointly released by China UnionPay, a domestic financial institution, and 17 commercial banks and payment institutions.“Affected by the epidemic, more offline payment scenarios have been migrating online…Meanwhile, small physical stores such as vendors and fruit stores have increased their online and offline payment integration, winning them customers during the epidemic,” the official news agency, Xinhua, reported, quoting from the survey.ATM manufacturers are adapting to the change and moving into making VTMs (virtual teller machines) and STM (smart teller machines.)However, ATM machines will not disappear in the immediate future, explained Yu Baicheng, the dean of Zero One Research Institute, a Beijing-based think-tank focused on finance. “Starting in 2015 and 2016, the transaction volume of bank deposits and withdrawals began to decline. Affected by this, banks’ demand for traditional ATM machines has declined, and some ATM suppliers have even withdrawn from the market,” Yu was quoted as saying by thepaper.cn.“However, ATM machines will not completely disappear, China’s regional development is quite different, and mobile payment cannot completely replace cash transactions,” Yu added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-atm-numbers-shrink-as-more-opt-for-cashless-payments-101617365823554.html
02-04-2021||World||Myanmar: Internet blackout widens, protesters vow to keep up the resistance||Opponents of military rule in Myanmar marched, observed strikes and sought alternative ways to communicate after most users were cut off from the internet on Friday, undaunted by the bloody suppression of protests during the past two months.Hundreds of people have been killed demonstrating since the Feb. 1 coup, and many people have been using social media to publicise the security forces' excesses and to organise against military rule.The authorities, who have already shut down mobile data, ordered internet providers from Friday to cut wireless broadband, depriving most customers of access. In response, anti-coup groups have shared radio frequencies, mobile apps such as maps that work without a data connection, and tips for using SMS messages as an alternative to data services to communicate."In the following days, there are street protests. Do as many guerrilla strikes as you can. Please join," Khin Sadar, a protest leader, said on Facebook in anticipation of the internet blackout, referring to quick protests in unexpected places that break up when the security forces appear."Let's listen to the radio again. Let's make phone calls to each other too."The military did not announce or explain its order to providers to cut wireless broadband. Internet was available only on fixed lines, rare in Myanmar where most homes and businesses connect through wireless networks.Authorities have been struggling to stifle an opposition demanding the restoration of civilian rule and release of elected government leader Aung San Suu Kyi and other figures.Violent incidents are occurring regularly in different parts of the country between the security forces and people set against military rule.In the town of Tamu on the Indian border, a policeman who supported the democracy movement was killed on Friday in a clash with security forces, the Monywa Gazette reported.Separately, security forces opened fire at a rally near the central city of Mandalay, wounding four people, two critically, according to three domestic media organisations.In the commercial hub of Yangon, a Myanmar employee of South Korea's Shinhan Bank died on Friday after being shot in the head while travelling in a minibus two days earlier, the bank said, adding it was discussing the situation with the government.Adding to the chaos in the former British colony, also known as Burma, hostilities between the armed forces and ethnic minority insurgents have broken out in at least two regions.Across the country, demonstrators held "flower strikes", leaving bouquets, some with messages of defiance, at places associated with activists killed by the security forces.People held up roses while making three-finger salutes, a symbol of resistance. Entire benches were covered in flowers and anti-coup messages.One arrangement of dandelions and red roses on a lakeside walkway read: "Myanmar is bleeding".Charged under the Official Secrets Act Despite the internet shutdown, users were still able to upload pictures of marches, flower strikes and a funeral of a slain protester.An image shared widely on social media showed an overhead view of hundreds of flickering candles on a dark road, forming the words "we will never surrender".Nobel laureate Suu Kyi and four allies have been charged with violating a colonial-era official secrets act, her chief lawyer said on Thursday, the most serious charge filed against her. Violations are punishable by up to 14 years in prison.Another of her lawyers, Min Min Soe, attended Suu Kyi's latest video-conference hearing on Thursday and said she was unable to tell whether the ousted leader, the figurehead of a decades-long fight against military dictatorship, was aware of the situation in the country.Some 543 people have been killed in the uprising, according to the Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP) advocacy group, which is tracking casualties and detentions. The military has repeatedly said those killed had instigated the violence.Protesters have been burning copies of the 2008 constitution after remnants of Suu Kyi's administration declared that it had repealed the military-drafted charter.Western countries have condemned the coup and the violence and some have imposed limited sanctions.Britain on Thursday blacklisted one of the military's conglomerates, following similar measures from other Western countries. Fashion brand Next announced it had suspended orders from Myanmar's factories.While Southeast Asian countries have traditionally been reluctant to criticise or sanction their neighbour, there are signs of growing dismay with a country that has for decades raised international concerns over its domestic repression.The Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore and most recently Thailand have called for an end to the violence.Several Southeast Asian foreign ministers have been meeting separately this week with their counterpart from China, which is among the few countries able to influence Myanmar's generals.In an interview transcript made available late on Thursday, Singapore Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan said he was "alarmed and appalled" at the violence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-internet-blackout-widens-protesters-vow-to-keep-up-the-resistance-101617363615143.html

The death toll may rise, he added.In a separate roadside bomb attack in western Herat province, seven women travelling in a minivan were wounded, the provincial governor's office said.No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attacks, but Afghanistan has seen a nationwide spike in bombings, targeted killings, and violence on the battlefield as peace negotiations in Qatar between the Taliban and the Afghan government have stalled.Meanwhile, in a statement late Thursday, the Islamic State group claimed responsibility for the killing of a policewoman in eastern Nangarhar province earlier that day.

02-04-2021||World||Severe Covid-19 travel curbs in South America as WHO blasts EU vaccine rollout||South American nations severely tightened coronavirus travel curbs including shutting their borders with Brazil, where infections are spiralling, as the WHO slammed Europe's "unacceptably slow" vaccine rollout.Many European Union nations are reeling from dramatic spikes in cases that have forced the reimposition of unpopular restrictions, including in Belgium where police used water cannon to disperse thousands who had gathered in violation of Covid-19 rules.Spikes in South America have reached alarming levels, fuelled by a more contagious variant first detected in Brazil, as Chile closed all borders, Bolivia sealed its frontier with Brazil, and Peru went into a lockdown over Easter."We are in a very critical moment of the pandemic," Chilean government spokesman Jaime Bellolio said Thursday, as the nation announced a border closure starting Monday.Intensive care units in Chile are close to capacity, and authorities are trying to speed up vaccinations in a bid to stem the spread of Covid-19.Neighboring Peru started a four-day national lockdown for the Easter weekend as it recorded its highest number of new cases since the start of the pandemic.The country has a ban in place on all flights from Brazil, Britain and South Africa until April 15 to try and keep out the variants first detected there.Ecuador's president also announced fresh curbs against an outbreak he described as a "public calamity".Brazil is the epicentre of the coronavirus wave sweeping South America, reporting a staggering 66,500 Covid-19 deaths in March alone.At a field hospital in the suburbs of Sao Paulo, one doctor said she was alarmed at the spread of the virus -- and frustrated to see many of her compatriots ignore face masks, shun social distancing guidelines and even flood to underground parties."I see no difference in people's behaviour. People don't seem to understand the magnitude of this," said 53-year-old surgeon Marise Gomes.'Unacceptably slow'Europe is also struggling to stop dramatic surges in infections, as the World Health Organization warned Thursday that its sluggish vaccination drive was prolonging a pandemic that has already claimed more than 2.8 million lives worldwide."Vaccines present our best way out of this pandemic... however, the rollout of these vaccines is unacceptably slow," said WHO director for Europe Hans Kluge."We must speed up the process by ramping up manufacturing, reducing barriers to administering vaccines, and using every single vial we have in stock."Only 10 percent of Europe's total population has received one vaccine dose, and four percent have received two, according to the WHO.The EU's stalling roll-out stands in stark contrast with China, where the virus first originated, where biopharmaceutical firm Sinovac said Friday a third production line for its Covid-19 vaccine has been put into use, doubling its annual capacity of the jabs to two billion doses.Amid surging cases, authorities in many EU countries including France, Italy and Belgium have been forced to reimpose restrictions, but after more than a year under such measures, populations are becoming increasingly weary.Frustrations boiled over in Belgium on Thursday, where police used water cannon to disperse a crowd of 2,000 people that had come to a Brussels park despite strict coronavirus restrictions against such gatherings.AFP journalists at the scene saw projectiles thrown at police in riot gear in the Bois de la Cambre park, venue of a fake concert announced on social media as an April Fool's Day prank.'We can't do anything'There was more concern about the AstraZeneca shot on Friday, as Australian health officials said they were investigating a possible link between the vaccine and a case of blood clotting in a man who received it.Several countries, including some EU nations, have temporarily suspended the AstraZeneca shot over concerns about side effects in recent weeks, but have so far found no evidence linking it with blood clots.The WHO, EU regulators and AstraZeneca say the jab is safe.War-torn Syria's first shipment of the AstraZeneca vaccine under the global Covax scheme has been delayed until at least May, as the country's intensive care facilities are overwhelmed by Covid-19 cases."There are many patients who need intensive care," said Asma Sbayni, a doctor at the Mouwasat Hospital in Damascus."Unfortunately, there are many critical cases who die in front of us... We can't do anything for them."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/severe-covid-19-travel-curbs-in-south-america-as-who-blasts-eu-vaccine-rollout-101617361640375.html

The violent clashes left scores injured and several motorcycles burnt, Pakistan's News International reported.The clash continued for over 90 minutes until police reinforcements and Sindh Rangers personnel controlled the situation and forced the devotees out of the premises.There was reportedly a thin deployment of the police at the shrine as the relevant authorities appeared remiss that the gathering of tens of thousands of devotees in the small town could create a law and order situation, Express Tribune reported.During the clash, the mob broke down barriers and set on fire several vehicles, including motorcycles. This followed a free for all and soon a large group tore open the main door of the shrine to make their way inside.As the coronavirus cases in Sindh increase, the provincial government has decided to shut down shrines across the province.A few days back, the Sindh Government has announced its decision to close all shrines and Dargahs in the province for 10 days while the annual Urs of Hazrat Lal Shahbaz Qalandar was cancelled in view of the third wave of Covid-19 in the country.Sindh has reported over 266,000 coronavirus cases so far. The province has also reported 4,500 fatalities due to the infection.On Thursday, Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah announced that the province was set to impose more stringent restrictions in view of a spike in the number of Covid-19 cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/clashes-in-pakistan-over-closure-of-shrine-as-covid-measure-leave-scores-injured-101617360844415.html

Sanders did not provide a date.The repairs included maintenance on the heating, ventilation and air conditioning system, replacing chimney liners and refurbishing some of the hardwood floors in the 19th century Victorian house, Sanders said.Officials had said it would be easier to do the work while the house was unoccupied after former Vice President Mike Pence and his wife moved out.Harris and Emhoff have spent the months since her inauguration on Jan. 20 living temporarily at Blair House, the president's official guest residence on Pennsylvania Avenue, across from the White House.Harris, a former U.S. senator from California, and her husband, were flying home to Los Angeles on Thursday with plans to remain there through Easter.The vice president has public events Monday in Oakland, California, and Tuesday in Chicago before her scheduled return to Washington later Tuesday evening.District of Columbia police recently arrested a man near the vice president’s official residence on a weapons charge.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kamala-harris-to-move-into-official-vp-residence-next-week-101617359881584.html

In June 2020, then US President Donald Trump temporarily suspended employment-based nonimmigrant visas, including H-1B, to “prioritise the highest-skilled workers and protect American jobs” amid coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic. The ban on foreign workers visa was later extended to March 31, 2021, which expired two days ago.“Visa applicants who were previously refused visas due to the restrictions of Presidential Proclamation 10052 may reapply by submitting a new application including a new fee,” the state department’s travel advisory stated.The department also assured that the visa applications of those who have not yet been interviewed or scheduled for an interview will be prioritised and processed in accordance with the existing phased resumption of routine visa services. No specific dates have been declared by the department for the resumption of specific visa services at each US mission or when they will return to the processing at pre-pandemic workload levels.“The resumption of routine visa services, prioritized after services to U.S. citizens, is occurring on a post-by-post basis, consistent with the Department’s guidance for safely returning our workforce to Department facilities,” the state department added.Last year, Tech leaders like Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Apple CEO Tim Cook had expressed disappointment over the Trump administration’s decision to temporarily ban nonimmigrant visas and reform the H-1B immigration program. Pichai, an immigrant himself, said that immigration has contributed immensely to the economic success of the United States, making it a global leader in technology.H-1B visa allows US employers to temporarily hire foreign workers in speciality occupations and Indian IT professionals looking for onshore opportunities heavily depend on it. The US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) on Tuesday announced the completion of the H-1B cap lottery process for the fiscal year 2022 as they received enough e-registrations to reach the H-1B quota of 85,000, including the master’s cap.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/foreign-workers-impacted-by-trump-travel-ban-can-reapply-for-h-1b-visa-101617358684873.html
02-04-2021||World||Myanmar's neighbour Thailand unlikely to toughen stance on coup||Thailand has slightly hardened its language on Myanmar by saying it is "gravely concerned" about escalating bloodshed since a Feb. 1 coup, but close military ties and fears of a flood of refugees mean it is unlikely to go further, analysts say.That leaves Thailand out of step with some members of the 10-strong Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), as they seek to ramp up pressure on the junta, but could also position it as a possible mediator."(Thailand’s position) is difficult, but I think there is an opportunity because we’ve become an important partner," Panitan Wattanayagorn, a political scientist at Bangkok's Chulalongkorn University, told Reuters.The closeness of the Thai and Myanmar armies was underscored by a request from Myanmar's junta leader, Min Aung Hlaing, to Thai Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha to "support democracy" within days of ousting elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi.Prayuth, who voiced that support, had himself seized power in a 2014 coup when army chief, before taking on his current civilian role in 2019 and rejecting opposition accusations that the vote was manipulated.The personal relationship began much earlier: within armies that appear to have long put behind them the historic rivalry between countries that used to be known as Burma and Siam.In 2018, Min Aung Hlaing was awarded Thailand's King Grand Cross of the Most Exalted Order of the White Elephant "in honour of the support he has shown for the Thai military," the Bangkok Post said at the time.Brotherhood"For them, the military brotherhood is very, very important," said Lalita Hingkanonta, a history professor at Thailand's Kasetsart University."I don't think that the escalation of violence will change the decision of the Thai government to accept more refugees...I think they just want to be friends with Myanmar more."Thailand potentially has more at stake in Myanmar than any other member of ASEAN, as it shares a 2,400-km (1,500-mile) border that is also Myanmar's longest with any neighbour.The geographical position, and a tradition of cautious diplomacy have been reasons for its particular care in remarks on the coup - only toughening its wording slightly after the civilian death toll topped 500 in Myanmar's crackdown on anti-coup protesters.Thailand's wording has still been much milder than that of ASEAN democracies Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Singapore.The border risks were highlighted by a surge of several thousand refugees this week fleeing bombing by Myanmar's forces of ethnic Karen rebels, an exodus reminiscent of the tens of thousands who fled Myanmar's wars in previous decades.Although Thailand denied that the latest refugees were being pushed back, they complained of having been blocked by Thai border guards, while a local Thai official told a meeting that it was official policy to bar their entry.GesturesWhile Thailand might come under diplomatic pressure to accept refugees or take a tougher stance, Lalita said Prayuth's government was unlikely to be moved."They would do something to respond to the international pressure, they would do some small things, just to show that, hey, we are responding very well to your concern. But that's it."Business links are also strong.Foreign direct investment by Thai businesses ranks behind only China and Singapore, with more than $11 billion approved since 1988.Annual cross-border trade stood at more than $9 billion in 2019 and many Thai businesses rely on Myanmar migrant workers - who officially number 1.6 million.Thailand matters even more for Myanmar, accounting for nearly a quarter of exports in 2019, mostly natural gas.But Thailand was unlikely to use its potential economic leverage with any sanctions on trade, said Piti Srisangnam, of the ASEAN Studies Center at Chulalongkorn University.He suggested Thailand might best pursue diplomacy behind the scenes, to try to encourage Myanmar's generals to curb violence and launch talks with ousted civilians now locked up or branded as traitors."If you have one friend you've known for a very long time, and one day he commits murder, it doesn't mean you won't be friends with him, right?" he said."You are still friends, but the best thing is to talk to him, to show that the thing he has done is very wrong."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmars-neighbour-thailand-unlikely-to-toughen-stance-on-coup-101617356918267.html

The benefits of the shot continue to outweigh the risks, the regulator said.AstraZeneca’s vaccine, developed with the University of Oxford, is under mounting scrutiny and has faced dwindling support in Europe. Still, countries are counting on the shot to help them exit the pandemic, and millions of doses have been administered across the region.Blood Clots, Anaphylaxis and Other Vaccine Fears: QuickTakeThe U.K. agency said that the 30 incidents were out of 18.1 million doses of AstraZeneca vaccine given by March 24. Prior to that, the agency disclosed five cases on March 18, out of 11 million shots.With the new reports, the rate of incidents with the AstraZeneca shot in the U.K. is about 1 in 600,000. There were no reports of the same reactions to the vaccine from Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE, which is also being used in Britain.“On the basis of this ongoing review, the benefits of the vaccines against Covid-19 continue to outweigh any risks and you should continue to get your vaccine when invited to do so,” the MHRA said. The AstraZeneca and Pfizer vaccines have shown “very high levels of protection” against Covid-19, the agency said, adding that “all vaccines and medicines have some side effects.”U.K. ProgramThe U.K. has one of the world’s fastest-moving vaccine programs, administering shots to more than half of all adults by late March. New daily Covid cases and deaths have fallen to the lowest levels since September, even as infections surge anew across much of the European Union, where immunizations have lagged.Earlier this week, the EU drugs regulator said a link between the AstraZeneca vaccine and a rare type of blood clot is possible, identifying at least 62 cases of the condition. The European Medicines Agency said its safety committee will probably issue an updated recommendation next week.Read more: EU Regulator Sees Possible Link Between Astra Shot and ClotsGermany has restricted younger people from taking the AstraZeneca vaccine amid growing concerns about side effects. That followed reports of 31 cases of the rare clots, mostly in women.Norway and Denmark extended suspensions on the use of the shot, which has also been the subject of a tussle over supplies between the EU, the U.K., and others.On Friday, Australia reported one case of clotting disorders following inoculation with the AstraZeneca vaccine and is investigating, according to a joint statement by government agencies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-sees-25-new-blood-clot-cases-after-astrazeneca-shots-101617355963340.html

They killed one suspected jihadi, whose wife then killed herself by activating an explosive belt, the statement said. The explosion killed her baby in her arms, while an older daughter also at the scene survived, according to the ministry.Authorities said it was the first time they had reported the presence of a woman among the jihadis taking refuge in the area.In a second operation, in the Mount Mghila area, security forces killed a suspected leader of Tunisia's Jund Al Khilafa brigade, the statement said. The brigade pledged allegiance to the Islamic State group and is believed to be behind several attacks in Tunisia in recent years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/extremist-kills-self-her-baby-in-tunisia-suicide-bombing-101617355205569.html
02-04-2021||World||Immigrants with temporary status have grown deep roots in US||Irma Chavez is a married mother of four who leads a business networking initiative in this small Arkansas city she calls home. It’s a long way from her life as a live-in housekeeper in California years ago, and further still from a childhood working in El Salvador’s coffee fields.What has indelibly marked the path of the 44-year-old marketing specialist is a government program that lets people from disaster-stricken and war-torn countries live and work legally in the United States. While the Trump administration tried to cancel the program for many immigrants, President Joe Biden is backing legislation that would give Chavez and hundreds of thousands of people like her a shot at becoming American citizens.It’s a monumental shift from six months ago, when a court gave the Trump administration the right to halt Temporary Protected Status, or TPS, for four countries, stoking fear among many of the program’s 411,000 recipients that they could be sent back to their homelands.Now, these immigrants are pinning their hopes on the Senate after the House passed a sweeping bill to let them call the United States their permanent home. The legislation, which faces uncertain prospects, would offer an eight-year pathway to citizenship to an estimated 11 million people in the U.S. illegally and put immigrants brought to the country as children and TPS recipients on an even faster track to becoming Americans.For Chavez, who lives in Springdale, Arkansas, and has been renewing her temporary status for two decades, the legislation could put an end to fears of deportation. It also would let her travel more easily to see her mother and sister in their humble Salvadoran hometown.“We really hope everything is going to change in our favor now,” Chavez said.While temporary, the program can be renewed by U.S. officials and has been repeatedly. If supporters and critics agree on anything, it’s that a temporary program should not last decades.Last fall, there were 10 countries designated for the program by the U.S. Homeland Security secretary. The Biden administration, which has eased some of Trump’s hardline immigration policies and is facing an uptick in migration, has recently added two more — Myanmar and Venezuela.More than half of those with the status are from El Salvador, which was designated for the program after a 2001 earthquake. Many have lived in the U.S. for decades and have no plan of returning to a country that still sees thousands of people leave each year in search of economic stability and safety from gangs.Giving these immigrants the ability to stay could drive many of them to buy homes and invest in businesses in U.S. communities still reeling from the coronavirus pandemic, said Manuel Orozco, director of the Center for Migration and Economic Stabilization at the development organization Creative Associates International.“It’s almost like the logical thing to do because they are de facto Americans,” Orozco said. “It definitely will create better conditions for them not only to integrate but also strengthen their economic roots, improving the economy.”On the outskirts of the Salvadoran city of Santa Ana, Chavez's sister Iris Franco runs an at-home bakery and delivers the bread on a bike. It’s how she supports herself and her four children, the oldest of whom is studying to be a doctor — the first in her family to attend college.In 1994, the family reluctantly agreed Chavez would head north to stay with relatives in Los Angeles and work for three years. Initially, Chavez was a housekeeper and later worked the night shift at a gas station.Chavez ended up staying because she got married and had children but kept sending money home. Once she had TPS, she got better jobs in stores and restaurants, moved to Oklahoma and later Arkansas, and eventually landed work in a chiropractor’s office.Franco, 41, said the family lives humbly in El Salvador but better thanks to her sister’s assistance. Chavez sends money to help cover their mother's diabetes medication and helped Franco rebuild her home after flooding.“It changed our life, because we knew that we had my sister in that place, and so in whatever she could, she has helped us,” Franco said.Not that migration hasn’t come at a price. Franco remembers her sister crying when their mother was ill and she couldn’t be there and on the many Mother’s Days she missed.The sisters finally saw each other four years ago when Chavez filed paperwork with the U.S. government to travel to El Salvador. After her trip, Chavez joined with Franco to start a nonprofit to give children in their Salvadoran neighborhood school supplies and a gift at Christmas.In Arkansas, Chavez is raising two young sons with her husband — a Brazilian-born chef at a well-known restaurant — while leading a networking initiative she hopes will lead to Springdale’s first Latino chamber of commerce. Her oldest son will get married this year, and the next in line works as a delivery driver. Both are from a previous marriage.Chavez said she's grateful for her temporary status, which the government extended pending the outcome of litigation over the Trump administration's push to end the program. But she has no guarantee of permanency in the United States.TPS also doesn't solve her own immigration problems. Chavez's U.S. citizen husband has sponsored her for a green card, but she needs an old immigration court order cleared to apply.The bill in Congress could change that, giving her assurance that she’ll never be separated from her children.“If there were an amnesty or residency for all those on Temporary Protected Status, I’d automatically be in,” she said. “I’d always be protected from deportation. It would have a big impact.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/immigrants-with-temporary-status-have-grown-deep-roots-in-us-101617352669509.html

He told EU representatives he hoped European pharmaceutical firms would consider more investment in Vietnam.Long on Wednesday met with Chinese, Indian and Russian diplomats to discuss vaccines.Vietnam has been praised for its record in containing its coronavirus outbreaks through mass testing and tracing and strict quarantining, which has kept its cases to just 2,617, with 35 deaths.It aims to immunize 70% of its population and has so far inoculated 51,200 people. The request for help come as some countries express concern about vaccine shortages.Four Vietnamese companies are engaged in vaccine research and production and two are at the human trial stage.Its first home-grown vaccine called Nanocovax is expected to be put into use in 2022.With vaccinations underway in many parts of the world, flag carrier Vietnam Airlines and budget airline Vietjet Air have resumed some outbound flights.However, inbound flights remain suspended other than those carrying foreigners with special permission, or returning Vietnamese nationals.A proposal by aviation authorities to allow vaccinated foreigners into the country from September without quarantine is pending government approval.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/vietnam-asks-for-foreign-support-in-procuring-covid-19-vaccines-101617352878500.html

02-04-2021||World||Indonesia's tourism mega-project 'tramples' on human rights: UN||A tourism mega-project on the Indonesian island of Lombok has uprooted local and indigenous people, and destroyed homes, fields, rivers, and religious sites, UN human rights experts said.The Mandalika, located in Lombok's West Nusa Tenggara province, includes a Grand Prix motorcycle circuit, hotels and a golf course, and is part of the "10 New Balis" strategy proposed by President Joko Widodo in 2016 to boost tourism revenues.In developing the 2-hectare (5-acre) site, "local residents were subjected to threats and intimidations, and forcibly evicted from their land without compensation", said Olivier De Schutter, UN special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights.Businesses and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) that funded the ongoing project, failed to do due diligence "to identify, prevent, mitigate and account for how they address adverse human rights impacts", he said in a statement.The AIIB said its operations adhered to its environmental and social guidelines, and that it had responded "swiftly" to complaints related to the project and commissioned an independent consultant to engage with the Indonesian government, businesses and local residents."The final report found no evidence of the alleged coercion, direct use of force, and intimidation relating to land acquisition and resettlement," it said in a statement late on Thursday.AIIB and the state-owned Indonesia Tourism Development Corporation (ITDC) have agreed on an action plan "to improve stakeholder engagement ... with project-affected people, village heads and local government officials, and more widely with civil society and the wider population of Lombok," it added.The ITDC and the Mandalika Grand Prix Association, which are both involved in the Mandalika development, did not respond to requests for comment.Globally, there is a growing awareness - and backlash against - the negative impacts of tourism, including environmental damage and the destruction of neighbourhoods as local residents are priced out.Poorer countries in Southeast Asia are particularly ill-equipped to limit the "invisible burden" of overtourism, said a 2019 report from The Travel Foundation charity in Britain.After the coronavirus pandemic devastated tourism-reliant economies of islands such as Indonesia's Bali and Thailand's Phuket, authorities are prioritising hospitality industry workers for vaccines in order to attract foreign tourists - a move criticised by human rights groups.The Mandalika was touted by authorities as critical to create jobs and improve livelihoods in the impoverished province, but human rights activists say the project - like many other tourism developments - has hurt indigenous people most."Indigenous people have no legal protections over their land and are not consulted or involved in the decision-making on these projects that do not benefit them," said Rukka Sombolinggi, secretary general of the Indigenous Peoples Alliance of the Archipelago (AMAN)."The government is keen to draw investors in industry, mining and tourism to revive the economy, but these are false solutions that hurt indigenous people, and have a big environmental impact, as well," she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.The Mandalika development "tramples on human rights (and) is fundamentally incompatible" with the concept of sustainable development, De Schutter said."The time has passed for massive transnational tourism infrastructure projects that benefit a handful of economic actors rather than the population as a whole," he added.Instead, governments keen to build back better after Covid-19 "should focus on empowering local communities", enhancing livelihoods, and enabling their participation in decision-making, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indonesias-tourism-mega-project-tramples-on-human-rights-un-101617350680470.html

We are in the process of assessing it. There will be a new evalutaion in the coming days", Le Maire told CNews television when asked if he was sticking to the government's economic growth target for this year. It has forecast growth of 6% for 2021.Le Maire reiterated that the new lockdown measures would force the temporary closure of 150,000 businesses at a cost of 11 billion euros per month.Bank of France Governor Francois Villeroy de Galhau said on Thursday he did not expect the new restrictions to have an impact on the bank's forecast of 5.5% growth in 2021, provided the restrictions do not last beyond early May.France reported more than 50,000 new Covid-19 infections on Thursday and 308 deaths, while the number of people in intensive care units rose to 5,109.Le Maire repeated his calls for the European Union to accelerate the implementation of its economic stimulus plan."Europe must understand that we must move fast and that the stimulus funds promised to European citizen must now arrive in member states... In 2022 or 2023 it will be too late. The Chinese and the Americans will be ahead of us," he said.Though the 27-nation bloc agreed the landmark stimulus fund last summer, EU governments are still submitting detailed plans on how they aim to spend money from the fund, which many still need to ratify.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-covid-19-restrictions-to-impact-french-growth-finance-minister-101617349910325.html

They agreed to a “sustained dialogue” in the future, it said.Vietnam and the U.S. “will continue to actively cooperate to comprehensively address the concerns to maintain stable trade relations,” the trade ministry said in a statement posted on its website.Vietnam’s currency had become a target in the Trump administration even as the former enemies continued to become closer to counter China’s rising military and economic might in the region. The U.S. has refrained from hitting Vietnam with punitive tariffs even after the U.S. Treasury designated the Hanoi government as a currency manipulator and the U.S. Trade Representative labeled Vietnam’s currency actions unreasonable and restrictive to American businesses.The USTR’s determination in January was the result of an investigation that started last year under section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 -- the same legislation the Trump administration used to apply tariffs on billions of dollars of imports from China.Vietnam’s central bank has maintained it doesn’t use the exchange rate to create an unfair competitive advantage in international trade. The Southeast Asian nation’s wood industry has vowed to tighten regulations and buy more American lumber to avoid punitive tariffs that would devastate the sector.Tai and Anh plan to hold a meeting later this year under the Trade and Investment Framework Agreement to work on “resolving bilateral issues,” according to the U.S. readout.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-trade-chief-raises-concerns-on-vietnam-currency-policy-101617341543308.html

02-04-2021||World||World Autism Awareness Day 2021: Theme, significance of the day||World Autism Awareness Day is observed every year on April 2 with the aim to spread awareness about autism and make people understand the challenges faced by those with the developmental disorder. The United Nations General Assembly unanimously declared April 2 as World Autism Awareness Day from 2008 after the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities came into force. The UN Department of Global Communications and UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs, in collaboration with the Specialisterne Foundation, will organise a virtual event to commemorate the day which will include moderated panel discussions with individuals on the autism spectrum who have themselves experienced the challenges, according to the United Nations (UN) website.“Persons with autism have long faced many of these inequalities, which have only been further exacerbated by the pandemic. It’s a problem made worse by long recognized discriminatory hiring practices and workplace environments that present major obstacles for persons with autism; all of which contribute to the unemployment or severe underemployment of a large majority of adults on the autism spectrum,” the UN said.Autism, which is also called autism spectrum disorder (ASD), is a complicated condition used to describe a group of neurodevelopmental disorders which are related to communication, social interaction, restricted, repetitive and stereotyped interests or patterns of behaviour.According to the 2011 Census of India, there are 7,862,921 children with disabilities below the 19 year age group in the country, among which 595,089 have an intellectual disability. According to a study done by INCLEN Trust International in 2018, about 1 in 100 children in India under age 10 have autism, and nearly 1 in 8 has at least one neurodevelopmental condition.Union health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan tweeted on World Autism Day and called for a “conducive space” for those with autism. “Interventions for people dealing with Autism need to be accompanied by broader actions. Let's do our bit to build an inclusive and supportive society by creating a conducive space for them,” he posted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-autism-awareness-day-2021-theme-significance-of-the-day-101617341930495.html
02-04-2021||World||Taiwan train derailment: 41 dead, many injured||A passenger train smashed into a vehicle on its tracks and partially derailed outside a rail tunnel in Taiwan on Friday, killing at least 41 people and injuring dozens. Survivors climbed out windows and onto roofs to reach safety in Taiwan's deadliest railway disaster.Officials in Hualien county said rescue efforts were continuing on the train reportedly carrying 350 passengers. The crash occurred early on a public weekend, and Taiwan's extensive rail system is popular with people avoiding treacherous mountainous roads.Most other people on the train have been rescued though rescuers are searching wrecked cars for “several people” who may be stuck in awkward places, railways news officer Weng Hui-ping said. He said the 36 confirmed dead was Taiwan’s worst-ever in terms of death toll.Weng said a construction site truck operated by the railway administration slid onto the track from a work site on the hillside above. The truck was off duty at the time. He said the speed of the train was uncertain when it crashed into the vehicle at 9:28 a.m. near the Toroko Gorge scenic area.The train had only partially emerged from the tunnel, and with much of it still inside, escaping passengers were forced to scale doors, windows and roofs to reach safety.Television footage and photos posted by people at the scene on the website of the official Central News Agency showed people climbing out the open door of a railcar just outside the entrance to the tunnel. The inside of one car was pushed all the way into the adjacent seat.In a tweet, Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen said emergency services “have been fully mobilized to rescue & assist the passengers & railway staff affected. We will continue to do everything we can to ensure their safety in the wake of this heartbreaking incident."The accident came on the first day of the four-day Tomb Sweeping Festival, an annual religious festival when people travel to their hometowns for family gatherings and to worship at the graves of their ancestors.Taiwanese Premier Su Tseng-chang said the Railways Administration would be required to immediately conduct checks along other track line to “prevent this from happening again.”Taiwan's last major rail crash was in October 2018 when an express train derailed while rounding a tight corner on the northeast coast, killing at least 18 people and injuring nearly 200.In 1991, a collision in western Taiwan killed 30 people and another accident a decade earlier had also killed 30. Those were said to the worst previous crashes on the railway system that dates from the late 19th century.Taiwan is a mountainous island where most of its 24 million people are squeezed onto flatlands along the northern and western coasts that is home to most of the island's farmland, biggest cities and high-tech industries. The lightly populated east is popular with tourists, many of whom arrive along the coastal railway lines to avoid treacherous mountain roads.Taiwan's extensive rail system has undergone substantial upgrades in recent years, particularly with the addition of a high-speed line connecting the capital Taipei with west coast cities to the south.The train involved in Friday's accident, the Toroko No. 408 is one of Taiwan's newer models and requires tickets to be reserved in advance with no standing allowed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taiwan-train-derailment-36-suspected-dead-many-injured-101617337739779.html
02-04-2021||World||A fifth of world's food-output growth has been lost to climate change||Climate change has been holding back food production for decades, with a new study showing that about 21% of growth for agricultural output was lost since the 1960s.That’s equal to losing the last seven years of productivity growth, according to research led by Cornell University and published in the journal Nature Climate Change. The study was funded by a unit of the U.S. Department of Agriculture.The revelation comes as the United Nations’ World Food Programme warns of a “looming catastrophe” with about 34 million people globally on the brink of famine. The group has cited climate change as a major factor contributing to the sharp increase in hunger around the world. Food inflation is also on the rise as farmers deal with the impact of extreme weather at a time of robust demand.This is the first study to look at how climate change has historically affected agricultural production on a global scale, using econometrics and climate models to figure out how much of the sector’s total productivity has been affected, across crops and livestock.The loss of productivity comes even as billions has been poured into improving agricultural production through the development of new seeds, sophisticated farm machinery and other technological advances.“Even though globally agriculture is more productive, that greater productivity on average doesn’t translate into more climate resilience,” said Ariel Ortiz-Bobea, an author of the paper and associate professor at Cornell’s Charles H. Dyson School of Applied Economics and Management.The damages to productivity growth aren’t evenly spread across regions.

Pfizer/BioNTech and Johnson & Johnson's shots are the other two vaccines approved in the country.With rising cases and several states even lifting mask mandates and with more infectious variants also spreading, health authorities are hoping that the contracts it struck with the currently approved vaccine makers will be enough for its entire population.U.S. top infectious diseases doctor Anthony Fauci told Reuters on Thursday that the country may not need AstraZeneca's COVID-19 vaccine even if it wins U.S. regulatory approval.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/moderna-gets-nod-in-us-to-speed-up-virus-vaccine-output-with-bigger-vials-101617334572735.html
02-04-2021||World||UK politicians oppose use of ‘divisive’ Covid-19 passports||Prime Minister Boris Johnson risks triggering a major backlash among members of the ruling Conservative Party if his UK government opts to use so-called Covid passports to help re-open the economy.More than 70 members of Parliament from three parties -- including 41 from Johnson’s Tories -- pledged to oppose the use of vaccine certificates, calling them “divisive and discriminatory.” They include former Conservative Party leader Iain Duncan Smith, former Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn and Liberal Democrat Party leader Ed Davey.“We oppose the divisive and discriminatory use of Covid status certification to deny individuals access to general services, businesses or jobs,” the pledge reads, according to a statement Friday from civil liberties campaign group Big Brother Watch. The pledge came as it emerged the government is considering using Covid certification as part of trials to re-open large scale events such as sports matches, concerts and conferences.The opposition from across the political spectrum suggests the premier may struggle to get the measure through Parliament if he pursues it. The government is studying Covid certification as a potential means to bolster confidence in returning to restaurants and entertainment venues while also helping to keep coronavirus cases under control.The Telegraph late Thursday reported that the government is set to trial passports demonstrating a person’s Covid status at sporting and cultural events within weeks. But a person familiar with the matter told Bloomberg that while such a policy is under consideration, no final decision has been taken, pending a review by the Cabinet Office over the feasibility of Covid certification.FA Cup FinalThe person also said that events including soccer’s FA Cup Final, one of the cup semi-finals, and the Snooker World Championships will take part in a pilot program in April and May to reopen large-scale events with less social distancing and larger crowds than currently permitted under Covid rules. The Brit Awards for music are also under consideration, according to the person, who spoke anonymously about unannounced plans.The pilot program forms part of the government’s road map for unlocking the economy, and will use “enhanced testing approaches,” according to the government plan published in February.The Cabinet Office report on certification is due for publication by June 21, though Johnson’s office has indicated interim findings are likely April 5 -- the same day the government is due to give an early indication on how foreign travel will re-open, something ministers have said won’t happen before May 17 at the earliest.“There’s definitely going to be a world in which international travel will use vaccine passports,” Johnson told reporters Thursday during a trip to northeast England. He also said proof of someone’s Covid status -- whether it’s immunity from having had the disease or an inoculation, or a negative test -- could be “useful” in re-opening the domestic economy.‘Useful’“Those three things working together will be useful for us as we go forward,” he said.Johnson’s comments contrast with those of Labour leader Keir Starmer, who told the Telegraph newspaper on Wednesday that using Covid passports for everyday social activities goes against the British “instinct.”As the vaccine is rolled out and deaths diminish, “there will be a British sense that we don’t actually want to go down this road,” he said.Starmer said he would examine any proposals before deciding Labour’s stance. But if the 41 Tories signing Friday’s pledge joined with all opposition MPs to vote against any measures on Covid certification, they’d have the numbers to defeat the government.Labour Member of the House of Lords Shami Chakrabarti called domestic Covid passports “an authoritarian step too far.” Influential rank-and-file Conservative Graham Brady said: “We should aim to return to normal life, not to put permanent restrictions in place.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-politicians-oppose-use-of-divisive-covid-19-passports-101617321152382.html

She wore a black mask and a black pantsuit and had short black hair.A few minutes later, “Jasmine” reemerged without the wig — revealing herself to be Jill Biden, laughing and proclaiming, “April Fools!”The first lady's aides told reporters that they were just as surprised to discover the true identity of “Jasmine.”In her 2019 memoir, “Where the Light Enters,” Biden admitted she enjoys playing pranks. When her husband was vice president during the Obama administration, she once hid in an overhead bin on Air Force Two, frightening the first person who was unlucky enough to try to pack his luggage there.“I've always believed you've got to steal the joyful moments when you can,” she wrote.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-first-lady-jill-biden-treats-reporters-to-april-fools-day-prank-101617333827459.html

And in front of all of the friends who are here, I just have to tell you he has been tireless for months and months, working on this issue," Harris said during a virtual meeting to discuss COVID-19 public education efforts."So, in front of everyone, I want to thank you, Vivek, for all you have been doing to lift us up as a nation and to also lift up the importance of following the science and the fact that we are in this together, and so lifting up the power and significance of the collective," Harris said.Murthy, who was sworn in as the surgeon general last week, introduced Harris at the virtual meeting."I'm so honoured to introduce one of our nation's most important leaders. One who has broken barriers and lifted up communities, a leader who is kind, and strong, and who inspired millions of people, including myself and a daughter, who called her Kamala auntie," Murthy said."To serve as a surgeon, in my role, I'm charged with looking out for the health and well-being of each and every American. I consider this to be as a sacred responsibility, particularly in this great moment. When we are living through a once in a century," he said.Observing that COVID-19 has caused tremendous suffering for millions of Americans, he said many of them lost family members to this virus."I myself have lost seven, including my uncle earlier this year. Many of us have also felt what it's like to be worried about your loved ones getting killed, especially family members of ours who are elderly, or who might work on the frontlines," he said.In her remarks, Harris talked about racial inequalities."It is very important to the President that we speak truth and address racial inequities across the board, but on this topic, in particular, in our healthcare system. And, again, these disparities existed long before," she said."When we look at the rates of infection and death in the Asian community, in the African American community, Latinos, our native community, the numbers are really unacceptable and tragic. In terms of the impact on these communities, of course, profound,” she said.This is something that the administration has been addressing, she said."We have a Racial Equity Task Force that is very much a part of our whole approach to this. And, in addition, you will often hear the president and all of us talk about the importance of equitable distribution of resources and support," Harris said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-surgeon-general-murthy-hailed-by-vp-harris-for-tireless-work-against-covid-101617330777047.html

We isolated this batch and it will be disposed of properly," the statement said on Thursday. "Discarding a batch of bulk drug substance, while disappointing, does occasionally happen during vaccine manufacturing, which is a complex and multi-step biological process.""We are pleased we have met our commitment to deliver enough single-shot vaccines by the end of March to enable the full vaccination of more than 20 million people in the United States. This is part of our plan to deliver 100 million single-shot vaccines to the U.S. during the first half of 2021, aiming to deliver those doses by the end of May," the statement further read.Emergent BioSolutions said in the statement it remains confident the requirements it will meet the safety requirements and standards of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).The Johnson & Johnson vaccine was approved for emergency use in the United States at the end of February, becoming the third vaccine to be authorized by the FDA in addition to the ones produced by Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna.On Wednesday, Johnson & Johnson said in a statement that it was still planning to supply 100 million doses by the end of May.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-j-j-covid-19-vaccine-supplier-acknowledges-botch-101617328980605.html

This first batch is part of 1.9 million doses that Yemen will initially receive throughout 2021.External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar had tweeted: “Arrival in Aden. Made in India vaccines land in Yemen,” with the hashtag ‘VaccineMaitri’.UNICEF Representative Philippe Duamelle and WHO Representative Dr Adham Ismail took delivery of the vaccines in Aden, together with the Minister of Health and Population Dr Qasim Buhaibeh, and the Deputy Minister of Public Health and Population Dr Ali Alwaleedi."The arrival of the Covid-19 vaccine doses is a critical moment for Yemen,” Duamelle said."As Covid-19 continues to claim lives around the world, Yemen now has the capacity to protect those most at risk, including health workers, so that they can safely continue to provide life-saving interventions for children and families. Vaccines work, vaccines save lives, now let’s start getting people vaccinated,” he added.Ismail said the shipment represents an important step in the fight against Covid-19 in Yemen.“It will help save lives, including those at highest risk of serious disease, and will help protect the health system. These safe and effective vaccines will be a game changer, but for the foreseeable future we must continue wearing masks, physically distance and avoid crowds," he said.Rehan Hafiz, Senior Country Manager Yemen, Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance expressed delight that Sana’a has received its first COVAX vaccine doses."We look forward to the launch of the vaccination campaign. Thanks to the work of the Government of Yemen and of the COVAX partners, and with the support of our donors, we are now able to protect our most vulnerable populations,” Hafiz said, adding that their work is only beginning, but the arrival of the first COVAX Covid-19 doses is a major milestone for Yemen.COVAX, the vaccines pillar of the Access to Covid-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator, is co-led by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance (Gavi) and the World Health Organization (WHO) – working in partnership with UNICEF as key implementing partner, as well as civil society organisations, vaccine manufacturers, the World Bank, and others.Spokesman for UN Secretary-General Stephane Dujarric also told reporters during the daily press briefing that Yemen received 360,000 vaccine doses shipped via the COVAX Facility.“These vaccines, licensed and manufactured by the Serum Institute of India, will enable health workers and other vulnerable populations to be protected against the virus,” he said.Dujarric said the first batch of vaccines along with 13,000 safety boxes and 1,300,000 syringes are critical for the safe and effective roll-out of the vaccination campaign in the country.Nearly 2 million doses are expected for Yemen this year, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/madeinindia-covid-19-vaccines-in-yemen-a-game-changer-un-official-101617326658111.html

Navalny told her off in front of a line of prisoners for 15 minutes, calling her a parasite and servant of the thieves in power," they said.Alexei Barinov, a doctor, told Reuters early on Thursday that Navalny's lawyers had asked him to treat Navalny and that they had asked the prison service either to allow him into the prison or to let Navalny out to a clinic."We're waiting for a decision from the FSIN (prison service)," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/jailed-kremlin-critic-navalny-lost-8kg-due-to-sleep-deprivation-say-allies-101617326652440.html

Security Council late Thursday strongly condemned the use of violence against peaceful protesters and the deaths of hundreds of civilians in Myanmar, but dropped the threat of possible future action against the military following the Feb. 1 coup.The British-drafted press statement approved by all 15 council members after intense negotiations that began Wednesday expressed “deep concern at the rapidly deteriorating situation” in Myanmar and reiterated the council's call on the military “to exercise utmost restraint.”The original draft was much stronger and would have expressed the Security Council’s “readiness to consider further steps,” which could include sanctions. It would also have “deplored” the use of violence against peaceful protesters and “condemned in the strongest terms the killing of hundreds of civilians by the security forces.”Also Read | Myanmar orders wireless internet shutdown: Telecoms But at China’s insistence, the reference to “further steps” was eliminated and the stronger language, including the words “killing" and “deplore," was softened in the final statement, council diplomats said, speaking on condition of anonymity because discussions were private.The reference to “further steps" was replaced in the final statement with a sentence saying council members “stressed that they continued to monitor the situation closely and would remain actively seized of the matter.”The final council statement also called “on all sides to refrain from violence” -- which diplomats said Russia demanded -- and “reiterated the need to fully respect human rights and to pursue dialogue and reconciliation in accordance with the will and interests of the people of Myanmar.”It also noted U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres' March 27 statement “calling for a firm, unified and resolute response from the international community."The press statement followed Wednesday’s closed council meeting at which the U.N. special envoy for Myanmar, Christine Schraner Burgener, warned that the country faces the possibility of civil war “at an unprecedented scale” and urged the Security Council to consider “potentially significant action” to reverse the coup and restore democracy.She didn’t specify what action she considered significant, but she painted a dire picture of the military crackdown and told the council in a closed briefing that Myanmar “is on the verge of spiraling into a failed state.” She urged the council “to consider all available tools to take collective action” and do what the people of Myanmar deserve — “prevent a multidimensional catastrophe in the heart of Asia.”The coup reversed years of slow progress toward democracy in Myanmar, which for five decades had languished under strict military rule that led to international isolation and sanctions. As the generals loosened their grip, culminating in Aung San Suu Kyi’s rise to leadership in 2015 elections, the international community responded by lifting most sanctions and pouring investment into the country.At Wednesday's virtual meeting, Schraner Burgener denounced the killing and arrest of unarmed protesters seeking to restore democracy. She cited figures from Myanmar’s Assistance Association for Political Prisoners that as of Wednesday, some 2,729 people have been arrested, charged or sentenced since the coup and an estimated 536 have been killed.This was the second press statement approved by the council since the coup.The council also adopted a presidential statement -- one step below a resolution -- on March 10 calling for a reversal of the coup, strongly condemning the violence against peaceful protesters and calling for “utmost restraint” by the military. It stressed the need to uphold “democratic institutions and processes” and called for the immediate release of detained government leaders including Suu Kyi and President Win Myint.The statement approved Thursday also calls for their immediate release.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/deep-concern-un-condemns-violence-against-myanmar-protesters-and-deaths-101617324945641.html
02-04-2021||World||Myanmar orders wireless internet shutdown: Telecoms||Myanmar's wireless broadband internet services were shut down on Friday by order of the military, a local provider said, as protesters continued to defy the threat of lethal violence to oppose the junta's takeover.A directive from the Ministry of Transport and Communications on Thursday instructed that "all wireless broadband data services be temporarily suspended until further notice,” according to a statement posted online by local provider Ooredoo.Fiber-based landline internet connections were still working, albeit at drastically reduced speeds.Also Friday, the New York-based Human Rights Watch issued a report saying that Myanmar's military has forcibly disappeared hundreds of people, including politicians, election officials, journalists, activists and protesters and refused to confirm their location or allow access to lawyers or family members in violation of international law.“The military junta's widespread use of arbitrary arrests and enforced disappearances appears designed to strike fear in the hearts of anti-coup protesters,” said Brad Adams, Human Rights Watch's Asia director. “Concerned governments should demand the release of everyone disappeared and impose targeted economic sanctions against junta leaders to finally hold this abusive military to account.”The crisis in the Southeast Asian nation has expanded sharply in the past week, both in the number of protesters killed and with military airstrikes against the guerrilla forces of the Karen ethnic minority in their homeland along the border with Thailand.In areas controlled by the Karen, more than a dozen civilians have been killed since Saturday and more than 20,000 have been displaced, according to the Free Burma Rangers, a relief agency operating in the area.About 3,000 Karen fled to Thailand, but many returned under unclear circumstances. Thai authorities said they went back voluntarily, but aid groups say they are not safe and many are hiding in the jungle and in caves on the Myanmar side of the border.The UN Human Rights Office for Southeast Asia called on countries in the region “to protect all people fleeing violence and persecution in the country” and “ensure that refugees and undocumented migrants are not forcibly returned,” UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric told reporters at UN headquarters in New York.The UN Security Council late Thursday strongly condemned the use of violence against peaceful protesters. The press statement was unanimous but weaker than a draft that would have expressed its “readiness to consider further steps,” which could include sanctions. China and Russia, both permanent Council members and both arms suppliers to Myanmar's military, have generally opposed sanctions.The statement came after the UN special envoy for Myanmar warned the country faces the possibility of civil war and urged significant action be taken or risk it spiraling into a failed state.Earlier this week, an opposition group consisting of elected lawmakers who were not allowed to be sworn into office February 1 put forth an interim charter to replace Myanmar's 2008 constitution. By proposing greater autonomy for ethnic minorities, it aims to ally the armed ethnic militias active in border areas with the mass protest movement based in cities and towns.More than a dozen ethnic minority groups have sought greater autonomy from the central government for decades, sometimes through armed struggle. Even in times of peace, relations have been strained and cease-fires fragile. Several of the major groups — including the Kachin, the Karen and the Rakhine Arakan Army — have denounced the coup and said they will defend protesters in their territories.The coup reversed years of slow progress toward democracy in Myanmar, which for five decades languished under strict military rule that led to international isolation and sanctions. As the generals loosened their grip, culminating in Aung San Suu Kyi's rise to leadership in 2015 elections, the international community responded by lifting most sanctions and pouring investment into the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-orders-wireless-internet-shutdown-telecoms-101617324996542.html
02-04-2021||World||Corporate criticism of GOP-led voting bills spreads to Texas||The ranks of big corporations now criticizing GOP efforts to restrict voting access spread Thursday to Texas as measures that would reduce options to cast ballots and limit polling hours advanced in the state Capitol.American Airlines, which is based in Fort Worth, came out against restrictive voting measures that have a favorable path to reaching Republican Gov. Greg Abbott's desk in the coming weeks.The opposition came the same day a package of sweeping elections changes cleared the GOP-controlled Senate and, notably, a day after some of Georgia’s most prominent corporate leaders came out publicly against a new election law after civil rights activists criticized their silence.“To make American’s stance clear: We are strongly opposed to this bill and others like it,” the airline said in a statement.Unlike in Georgia, the corporate criticism in Texas to the election bills comes before they have been signed into law. Corporate interests carry big clout in the Texas Capitol, but Abbott and other Republicans have given no indication of wavering in their pursuit of passing the measures before the session ends in May.The passage of Senate Bill 7 along party lines after midnight early Thursday was a key marker in the GOP's campaign to impose new restrictive voting rules in America's biggest red state.Hours later, House Republicans began efforts to move a similar bill, known as House Bill 6, to the floor with nearly 200 people signed up to testify.Billionaire Michael Dell, whose tech company is headquartered in suburban Austin, tweeted Thursday, “Governments should ensure citizens have their voices heard. HB6 does the opposite, and we are opposed to it."Critics of the Texas legislation say the efforts particularly target expanded access put into place during last year's election in Harris County, which is home to more than 2 million voters, controlled by Democrats and a key Texas battleground that includes Houston.One measure would eliminate drive-thru voting, which more than 127,000 people around Houston used during early voting last year. More than half of those voters were Black, Latino or Asian, said Democratic state Sen. Carol Alvarado.“Hearing all of that, who are you really targeting when you're trying to get rid of drive-thru voting?" she said.Republicans rejected accusations that the bill was designed to suppress turnout.“None of what we've discussed is voter suppression. And none of what we've discussed is Jim Crow,” Republican state Sen. Paul Bettencourt said.The voting packages in Texas mirror a nationwide campaign by Republicans after former President Donald Trump made false claims about election fraud.Voting rights groups say the measures would disproportionately impact racial and ethnic minority voters. In Texas, which already has some of the strictest voting laws in the U.S., the proposed legislation grants more power to partisan poll watchers and eliminates the option to cast a ballot via drive-thru. The bill also includes a provision requiring a doctor’s note for people with disabilities who want to vote by mail, although Republicans signaled during the debate that language could change.Trump won Texas but by fewer than 6 points. It was the closest victory by any GOP presidential nominee in Texas since 1996, underscoring Republicans' loosening iron grip on the state.The Senate bill cleared a committee last week following hours of testimony by voters. Some said the ongoing coronavirus pandemic is forcing them to choose between their health and their right to be heard by their government after weighing the risk of testifying on the bill in-person at the Texas capitol, where masks are not enforced.Ofelia Alonso, 25, a volunteer with civil rights advocacy group Texas Rising and volunteer deputy registrar, said Friday she drove hundreds of miles from Cameron County along the U.S.-Mexico border, which has been hit extremely hard by COVID-19, to testify in Austin for the members of her community who couldn't afford the health risk.“Honestly, because we all work doing voter registration, we know how nonsensical this bill is," Alonso said. "It makes absolutely no sense to criminalize people for wanting to participate in democracy, which should be our goal. It is almost like Texans get punished for coming out and voting in large numbers.”___Associated Press writer Acacia Coronado contributed to this report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/corporate-criticism-of-gop-led-voting-bills-spreads-to-texas-101617324180421.html

The list of 13 symptoms included fatigue, muscle pain and difficulty concentrating as well as loss of taste and smell.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageWomen were more more likely (14.7 percent) to report such long-lasting symptoms than men (12.7 percent).Those aged 35-49 were most likely to report symptoms at five weeks (25.6 percent).The study of UK patients was based on a random sample of 21,622 participants who tested positive from swabs and were asked about their symptoms monthly.A control group who were unlikely to have been infected was also set up. It found they were eight times less likely to have such symptoms.A larger survey of 1.1 million people self-reported long Covid over the four weeks ending March 6, 2021, the ONS said.Ben Humberstone, Head of Health Analysis and Life Events at the ONS said this was its first analysis of new data and "our understanding of it and its quality will improve over time".Long Covid "is an emerging phenomenon that is not yet fully understood", he added.Britain, one of the countries worst hit by the pandemic, has recorded nearly 127,000 deaths from Covid and 4,350,266 cases.However, the number of daily deaths and positive tests have fallen steadily amid a strong vaccination campaign.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/almost-1-in-7-suffers-long-covid-uk-study-101617324570471.html
02-04-2021||World||A ghostly set of images, and a glimpse of danger at the southern US border||A border wall. Smugglers. Small children being dropped into America in the darkness.A grainy video released Wednesday by authorities — its figures visible only in ghostly white outline, its stark storyline dramatic and obvious — captures, in mere seconds, the dangers for migrant children at the southern US border.A man straddling a 14-foot barrier near Santa Teresa, New Mexico, lowers a toddler while holding onto one arm. With the child dangling, he lets go. She lands on her feet, then falls forward face first into the dirt. The smuggler does the same thing with a slightly larger child, who falls on her feet and then her bottom. Then the smuggler and another man run off into the desert, deeper into Mexico.The simple scene caught by a remote camera is an extreme case. But it embodies so much of the saga playing out on the border amid a spike in migrant arrivals, particularly children.There is implied desperation — a family willing to subject their children to such risks in hopes of changing their future. There is the callousness of the smugglers handling kids like rag dolls.And there is that barrier over which so many have fought — a symbol of American strength for some, a decidedly un-American thing altogether for others. A fence that, despite its height, is relatively easily overcome.For immigrant advocates, scenes like this underscore why immigration laws need to be overhauled with a focus on unifying families and making legal immigration easier. For many opponents of such reform, scenes like this are confirmation that the nation's rule of law isn't being respected, that a reform of immigration policies could never even be contemplated while such things are happening. And Americans of all political stripes may debate what circumstances, if any, justify parents taking such actions.While such debates happen, thousands of migrants from Mexico, Central America, and countries further south are arriving every day to the Mexico-U.S. border. Many are fleeing violence or other hardships in their home countries. Others are simply looking for better economic opportunities. They arrive by boat or wade through the Rio Grande River in Texas, or come on land into California, Arizona and New Mexico.Many are children traveling alone. Border authorities encountered more than 9,000 children without a parent in February, the highest single month since May 2019, when 11,000 unaccompanied minors came to the border.Unlike their parents in many situations, all unaccompanied minors are allowed to stay in the U.S. That dynamic has prompted many parents to either send kids on the journey to America alone, or get to the border and let them go the rest of the way. Most end up at least temporarily in shelters that are currently way beyond capacity.Border authorities said the children caught on video were sisters, ages 3 and 5, and from Ecuador. They were found alert, taken to a hospital and cleared or any physical injuries. As of Thursday, they remained at a Border Patrol temporary holding facility pending placement by the U.S. Health and Human Services Department.The girls’ mother is in the United States and authorities are in contact with her, Roger Maier, a spokesman for U.S. Customs and Border Protection, told The Associated Press on Thursday. Maier couldn’t provide more details.Many children arriving alone have relatives in the United States. If they are too young to remember names or phone numbers, as these girls likely were, they may come with contact information written down on paper or directly on their bodies. After being processed by the Border Patrol, they are transferred to Health and Human Services. Eventually they will be released to a sponsor, usually a parent or close relative.The hope of those who send the children is that they will eventually be reunited with family in the U.S. But the risks to get to that point are enormous.They can come from traveling without parents. They can come from the actual crossing, whether by river, crammed into a vehicle or on foot through the desert and traversing a wall; last year, a woman died after falling from a barrier in the Santa Teresa area where the girls were found. Finally, the risks can come from unscrupulous smugglers.“People considering using the services of smugglers need to know that smugglers don’t have the kids’ best interest at heart. It’s entirely too dangerous,” said Maier, who added this about the girls being dropped: “Had it not been an area that was monitored, these children would have been fending for themselves.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/a-ghostly-set-of-images-and-a-glimpse-of-danger-at-the-southern-us-border-101617324093643.html
02-04-2021||World||Pandemic poised to surge again in California's Silicon Valley tech hub||A California community that has been a bellwether of the coronavirus pandemic's rampage across the United States warned on Thursday that the number of cases of more contagious Covid-19 variants is increasing to worrisome levels."The region's progress in curbing the pandemic remains precarious," the health department in Santa Clara County, home to California's Silicon Valley, said."County residents are therefore urged to avoid travel, quarantine if travelling, and consistently use face coverings."The situation in Santa Clara, which was home to an early surge of coronavirus in California last year and the nation's first death from Covid-19, offers a window into the pandemic's progress across the wider United States.Several states, including Florida and Michigan, are struggling to contain a resurgence of the virus linked to new highly contagious variants.The 7-day daily average of cases across the United States has been increasing continuously since March 19, Reuters analysis shows. Over the past 13 days, the average daily number of new cases of Covid-19 has increased by about 17%, from 5,5591 on March 19 to 6,4814 on March 31. Total cases stand at 30,562,884, including 552,932 deaths."We're already seeing surges in other parts of the country, likely driven by variants," Santa Clara Health Officer Sara Cody said in a statement. "Combined with the data we are seeing locally, these are important warning signs that we must continue to minimize the spread."The rise in cases comes despite unprecedented efforts to vaccinate people worldwide and across the United States, where nearly 30% of the population had received at least one vaccine dose by Thursday, according to data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).Many U.S. states are moving to ease pandemic public health restrictions, and people who have been vaccinated are starting to venture out from a year of staying mostly at home.But with the vast majority of the population still unvaccinated, experts warn that could be a recipe for a deadly fourth wave of the disease.In California, the most populous U.S. state with 40 million residents, about 5.6 million people, or 17.3% percent of the population, had received one vaccine dose, the CDC said.As cases have leveled off in recent weeks, state officials have reopened activities like restaurant dining and are making plans to send children back to school.However, California Governor Gavin Newsom warned that with at least seven variants of the virus in circulation, the state is not close to achieving so-called herd immunity, which would require the vast majority of people to be inoculated."Now is not the time to spike the ball," said Newsom, who received his own vaccination on Thursday in Los Angeles. "Now is not the time to announce, "mission accomplished."In neighbouring Canada, officials in the province of Ontario declared a limited lockdown beginning on Saturday, while French president Emmanuel Macron on Wednesday ordered his country into its third national lockdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pandemic-poised-to-surge-again-in-california-s-silicon-valley-tech-hub-101617324058604.html

The sources spoke on condition of anonymity.France's foreign ministry spokeswoman told reporters in a daily briefing that the European powers were working closely with Russia and China - the other remaining parties to the deal - to find a solution to the deadlock and had been talking with both Tehran and Washington."These exchanges are more than necessary because Iran has not accepted to take part in direct contacts between the other participants of the JCPOA and the United States ... which would have eased discussions," spokeswoman Agnes von der Muhll said.Without elaborating, she said that they were now looking at alternative formats to enable talks.U.S. State Department spokesman Ned Price said the United States welcomed the meeting as "a positive step.""We have been clear for weeks now that we are ready to pursue a return to compliance with our JCPOA commitments consistent with Iran also doing the same," said Price, adding that Washington was willing to achieve that "through a series of initial mutual steps."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-world-powers-to-discuss-us-return-to-nuclear-deal-compliance-today-101617324202932.html

My general feeling is that given the contractual relationships that we have with a number of companies, that we have enough vaccine to fulfill all of our needs without invoking AstraZeneca."Late last year, the drugmaker and Oxford University published data from an earlier trial with two different efficacy readings as a result of a dosing error. Then in March, more than a dozen countries temporarily suspended the use of AstraZeneca's vaccine after reports linked it to a rare blood clotting disorder.Also in March, a U.S. health agency said data from the company gave an incomplete picture of its efficacy. Days later AstraZeneca published results showing diminished, though still strong, efficacy.Fauci said that "If you look at the numbers (of doses) that we're going to be getting, the amount that you can get from J&J, from Novavax from Moderna if we contract for more, it is likely that we can handle any boost that we need, but I can't say definitely for sure."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fauci-says-us-may-not-need-astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine-101617320275376.html
02-04-2021||World||How Floyd's 'spark of life' played out at trial||Prosecutors trying a white former Minneapolis police officer in George Floyd’s death put Floyd's girlfriend on the witness stand Thursday in an effort to humanize him for the jury, but her testimony also gave the defense an opportunity to delve into Floyd's drug use.Prosecutors used a legal doctrine called “spark of life” to call Courteney Ross to testify about Floyd's life, and are expected to call a Floyd family member to the witness stand later. They are trying to portray Floyd's complicated life, from his childhood in Houston’s Third Ward, where he came to be seen as a mentor, to his struggle with drug addiction in Minneapolis.But the “spark of life” doctrine, which is rare outside Minnesota, is controversial among defense attorneys and could complicate the trial. Here's how legal experts see that playing out:WHAT IS THE “SPARK OF LIFE” DOCTRINE?The doctrine emerged in 1985 when a defendant accused of killing a police officer argued to the Minnesota Supreme Court that the prosecutor prejudiced the jury with a speech about the officer’s childhood, his parents and his marriage. The prosecutor became so emotional the trial court had to take a recess.The court ruled that prosecutors can present evidence that a murder victim was “not just bones and sinews covered with flesh, but was imbued with the spark of life. The prosecution has some leeway to show that spark and present the victim as a human being as long as it is not an attempt to invoke any undue sympathy or inflame the jury’s passions.”WHAT DID THE JURY LEARN?Ross told jurors that she and Floyd were both drug addicts stemming from their struggles with chronic pain. She said they “tried really hard to break that addiction many times.”“We’re learning that Floyd is not a perfect person, as none of us are,” said David Schultz, a law professor at the University of Minnesota.After watching the first days of testimony, Schultz said it was clear prosecutors were “pulling at the emotional strings of the jury” to make a case for convicting Derek Chauvin of the most severe charges.Chauvin, 45, is charged with murder and manslaughter. Prosecutors say he knelt on Floyd's neck for 9 minutes, 29 seconds, pinning the handcuffed man to the ground. The most serious charge — 2nd-degree murder — against the former officer carries up to 40 years in prison.“What the spark of life is bringing in, is painting a picture of perhaps Chauvin was indifferent to the problems to the health and the life and safety of George Floyd,” Schultz said.DID IT BACKFIRE?When Chauvin's defense attorney Eric Nelson cross-examined Ross, he questioned her on Floyd's drug use, driving hard for her to talk about how Floyd was hospitalized in March 2020 and how she had speculated that it was because he had used heroin. Ross drove Floyd to the emergency room because he was suffering from extreme stomach pain, and she later learned he had overdosed.“It was the defense’s best day in terms of testimony,” said F. Clayton Tyler, a prominent local defense attorney. “The fact that he overdosed, I thought that was huge.”Legal experts expect Floyd's cause of death to be key at trial. The defense has argued Floyd’s death was caused by his drug use, underlying health conditions and the adrenaline flowing through his body. An autopsy found fentanyl and methamphetamine in his system.Attorneys for both sides will bring expert witnesses to provide competing testimony about what killed Floyd. Jurors will have to decide.“It’s an excellent tactic for the state to try to get jurors to feel sorry for a person because he’s an addict, but in this case, being an addict means he’s violating the law,” said Joe Friedberg, a defense attorney.Some legal experts have said if prosecutors go too far to invoke undue sympathy, Chauvin's defense could have grounds for an appeal. But Friedberg doubted that would happen, saying Hennepin County Judge Peter Cahill would halt testimony if it goes too far.Tyler also reasoned that the defense was bound to highlight Floyd's drug addiction at some point anyway, so by using “spark of life” prosecutors can address it head-on while showing "who he was as an individual.”___Associated Press writer Todd Richmond contributed from Madison, Wisconsin.___Find AP’s full coverage of the death of George Floyd at: https://apnews.com/hub/death-of-george-floyd||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/how-floyd-s-spark-of-life-played-out-at-trial-101617320200492.html

Jennifer Amat also revealed that the gunman had chained gates to the complex closed, forcing officers who responded Wednesday to engage him from outside.Police recovered an automatic handgun and a backpack with pepper spray, handcuffs and ammunition.Police withheld the identities of the dead but said one was a 9-year-old boy. The others were a man and two women. The wounded victim was only identified as a woman.The gunman was also wounded and hospitalized. It was unclear whether the suspect suffered a self-inflicted wound or was shot by police.Wednesday's shooting happened in the city of Orange southeast of Los Angeles. When officers arrived, shots were ringing out at the building that includes a mobile home brokerage.The violence was the third U.S. mass shooting in just over two weeks.California Gov. Gavin Newsom in a tweet called the killings “horrifying and heartbreaking.” “Our hearts are with the families impacted by this terrible tragedy tonight,” he said.Amat said the shooting happened on both levels of the building.Signs outside indicated a handful of businesses are located there — including an insurance office, a financial consulting firm, a legal services business and a phone repair store.People gathered outside the building after the shooting hoping to get word about loved ones.Paul Tovar told KTLA-TV that his brother owns a business in the building, Unified Homes, a mobile home broker.“He's not answering his phone, neither's my niece,” Tovar said. “I'm pretty scared and worried ... right now I'm just praying really hard.”Charlie Espinoza also was outside the building and told The Orange County Register that he could not reach his fiancee, who works for a medical billing company.Cody Lev, who lives across the street from the office building, told the newspaper he heard three loud pops that were spaced out, then three more. There was a period of silence and then Lev said he heard numerous shots, followed by sirens and more shots.A Facebook livestream posted by a resident who lives near the office appeared to show officers carrying a motionless person from the building and officers helping another person.Tim Smith's home is separated from the office's parking lot by a backyard wooden fence. He was in the back of his house when he heard a volley of three gunshots, then a volley of three and a final volley of four.“The first words I heard after the shots were fired were Don't move or I will shoot you,'” Smith, 64, recounted Thursday morning.Smith said he heard that repeated twice more by a man's voice and believes it was a police officer speaking. He did not hear other voices or more shots. He later peeked over the fence and saw SWAT officers marching in a line in the building's courtyard.“It saddens me so much,” he said. “A senseless loss of life.”The killings followed a mass shooting at a supermarket in Boulder, Colorado, last week that left 10 dead. A week before that, six Asian women were among eight people killed at three Atlanta-area spas.“Enough is enough," U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California, tweeted. ”We have to do something about the guns on our streets."Orange is about 30 miles (48 kilometers) from Los Angeles and home to about 140,000 people. Amat said the shooting was the worst in the city since December 1997, when a gunman armed with an assault rifle attacked a California Department of Transportation maintenance yard.Arturo Reyes Torres, 41, an equipment operator who had been fired six weeks earlier, killed four people and wounded others, including a police officer, before police killed him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/gunman-knew-victims-in-california-building-attack-police-101617315605621.html
02-04-2021||World||Biden admin lauds talks on readmitting US to Iran nuke deal||The Biden administration on Thursday welcomed a European Union announcement that the participants in the Iran nuclear deal will meet this week to discuss a possible return of the United States to the 2015 accord.Friday’s virtual meeting of officials from Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia and Iran comes as the US is exploring ways to rejoin the deal that former President Donald Trump withdrew from in 2018. The State Department praised the meeting and said it would be watched closely by US officials.“We obviously welcome this as a positive step and that’s precisely because we have been clear for weeks now that we are ready to pursue a return to compliance with our (nuclear deal) commitments consistent with Iran also doing the same,” spokesman Ned Price said. “It’s a positive step, especially if it moves the ball forward on that mutual return to compliance that we’ve talked about for a number of weeks now.”Earlier Thursday, the EU said one of its top diplomats, Enrique Mora, would chair the meeting. “Participants will discuss the prospect of a possible return of the United States to the (nuclear deal) and how to ensure the full and effective implementation of the agreement by all sides,” it said.President Joe Biden has said the US will to return to the deal if Iran comes back into compliance with it. Thus far, Iran has refused to entertain the offer unless the U.S. rescinds sanctions that Trump imposed on it. Iran already rejected an EU proposal for a meeting that included the United States. That proposal came in response to a Biden administration statement that it would accept an invitation to attend such talks.Meanwhile, the State Department said it had extended a waiver that allows Iraq to continue to buy power from Iran without being subject to U.S. sanctions. penalties. The waiver was renewed for 120 days, an increase in shorter extensions that had become commonplace during the Trump administration.Price said the extension was granted because of progress Iraq is making in developing its own electricity generation to reduce its reliance on outside sources of power. U.S. and Iraqi officials are resuming a strategic dialogue soon that places energy near the top of priorities and Washington hopes “will ultimately allow Iraq to develop its energy self-sufficiency, and we hope to end its reliance on Iran,” Price said.“In the interim, renewal of the sanctions waiver is appropriate, until the agreement and development of the Iraqi energy sector can be fully realized and implemented.," he said. Price added that the U.S. believed the four-month extension was long enough for Iraq “to take meaningful action to promote energy self-sufficiency and to reduce its dependence on expensive Iranian energy.”The Trump administration had only reluctantly approved such extensions because they ran counter to its “maximum pressure” campaign on Iran. Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had been granting the waivers but reducing their length to push Iraq to wean itself from Iranian electricity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-admin-lauds-talks-on-readmitting-us-to-iran-nuke-deal-101617314527926.html
02-04-2021||World||At first cabinet meeting, Biden says team 'looks like America'||President Joe Biden's first Cabinet meeting looked and felt different from those of his predecessor.Biden's full Cabinet met Thursday in the spacious White House East Room, not the comparatively cramped West Wing room that bears the group's name, to allow for social distancing during the coronavirus pandemic.Many smaller tables were pushed together to create one gigantic square. Department secretaries and other participants wore face masks. And the portion of the meeting opened to press coverage lacked the over-the-top, hail-to-the chief tributes that came to define Donald Trump's Cabinet meetings.Biden immediately pointed out the diversity of his Cabinet, which includes the first Black defense secretary in Lloyd Austin, the first openly gay Cabinet member in Pete Buttigieg at transportation, the first Native American secretary in Deb Halaand at Interior and the first female treasury secretary in Janet Yellen, among others.Vice President Kamala Harris is the first woman, Black person and Indian American elected to her office.Biden declared the group “looks like America" and added, "That's what we promised we were going to do, and we've done it.”Trump's Cabinet was largely white and male.Thursday's meeting came a week after the Senate confirmed the final Cabinet member and a day after Biden released his infrastructure plan, which was a major item on the agenda.The White House allowed press to witness just the opening three minutes, where Biden announced that he had asked five Cabinet secretaries “to take special responsibility to explain the plan to the American public.” He directed Transportation's Buttigieg, Energy's Jennifer Granholm, Housing and Urban Development's Marcia Fudge, Labor's Marty Walsh and Commerce's Gina Raimondo to be especially visible to the public and lead outreach on Capitol Hill.Biden also directed the entire Cabinet to examine agency spending to ensure it follows his “Buy American” commitment.With the sales blitz for the infrastructure plan just beginning, the focus of the meeting was on how the package can be relevant across government, as well on continuing to emphasize benefits Biden expects from the $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief bill he signed into law this month, said White House deputy press secretary Andrew Bates.Cabinet meetings in the modern era are less about setting administration policy than ensuring that all the government agencies are on the same page, say former officials. The sessions also offer presidents an opportunity to make their priorities and values clear. Deeper debates are generally reserved for smaller, subject-specific gatherings of Cabinet officials and senior advisers, such as the National Security Council and the Domestic Policy Council.“As the federal government has become increasingly complex over the years, the role of the Cabinet has evolved as well," said Chris Lu, President Barack Obama’s first-term Cabinet secretary. “In addition to serious policy discussions, Cabinet meetings are an opportunity for the president to lay out broad directions for how his team should operate."“The meetings can help align priorities, build morale, and allow Cabinet members to develop relationships with colleagues who they don’t normally see,” Lu said.All 16 permanent members of the Cabinet — the vice president and heads of the executive departments, including Yellen, Austin and Secretary of State Antony Blinken — attended in person on Thursday. So did other Cabinet-rank officials, including White House chief of staff Ron Klain and Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines.Shalanda Young, acting budget chief, participated after Neera Tanden, Biden’s first choice for that job, withdrew her nomination amid Senate opposition. Biden is also awaiting the confirmation of Eric Lander to lead the Office of Science and Technology Policy, a post the president has elevated to Cabinet rank.In all, 25 people were there, the White House said.In normal times, scheduling an in-person Cabinet meeting would require weeks of planning to block off time in the travel schedules of the various principals. These days, most remain in Washington due to the pandemic.Trump’s Cabinet meetings became known for their high level of presidential adoration, with “Dear Leader”-esque praise coming from attendees. His first full Cabinet meeting, held in June 2017, began with Vice President Mike Pence declaring that it was “the greatest privilege of my life to serve as the vice president to the president who is keeping his word to the American people.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/at-first-cabinet-meeting-biden-says-team-looks-like-america-101617314288344.html

In the US alone, the efficacy rate was 92.6%, according to a report on Thursday by the two companies.At the same time, the companies provided some of the first data on how their vaccine might handle the immune-evading B.1.351 variant that arose in South Africa.Pfizer also said the vaccine was highly effective against the South African variant in the latest phase of ongoing clinical trials. No cases of the disease were observed in South Africa during the phase-three trial study among participants who had received their second dose, it said in a joint statement with BioNTech.French President Emmanuel Macron, meanwhile, has announced a nationwide four-week lockdown starting on Saturday, closing schools and business, in the latest sign that Europe is yet again losing control of the pandemic.The World Health Organization lambasted Europe’s “unacceptably slow” vaccine roll-out, adding that the continent’s surge in cases was “worrying”.In Germany, President Frank-Walter Steinmeier received the first dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine, two days after authorities recommended use of the jab only for people aged 60 and over.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pfizer-vaccine-91-effective-after-6-months-new-findings-101617312171581.html

02-04-2021||World||Indian workers get less wage premium in US than English-speaking immigrants: Study||American companies hire foreign students due to skills shortage and not because they are a source of cheap labour, according to a new working paper by the Center for Growth and Opportunity, a university-based academic research centre in Utah. The previous administration had introduced a series of changes in visa policy, including a temporary ban on employment-based nonimmigrant visas, intended to prevent US employers from hiring low-cost foreign workers and push the so-called protectionist policy.During the last days of the Trump administration, the then secretary of labour Eugene Scalia had said that the administration was taking those steps to strengthen “wage protections, address abuses in visa programs, and protect American workers from being undercut by cheaper foreign labour.”US President Joe Biden on Thursday let the ban on foreign workers visa, including H-1B, lapse amid ongoing policy debates over the use of work visas by American companies to hire foreign professionals. H-1B visa, B-1 and B-2 visas, and F-1 visa are some prominent non-immigrant visas. H1-B visa allows US employers to temporarily hire foreign workers in speciality occupations that require theoretical or technical expertise. Indian IT professionals looking for onshore opportunities heavily depend on H-1B.Omid Bagheri, assistant professor of Economics at the Kent State University at Salem (Oregon) and author of the study, examined the wage gap between college graduate immigrants working in the US on a work visa and their native counterparts. Bagheri suggested that the demand for skilled workers exceeds the supply of skilled workers in the United States and companies pay “significant premiums to hire foreign workers.”The study estimated that on average, skilled immigrants with temporary work visas have a wage premium of 29.5% compared to similar natives. However, the wage premium, according to the study, is less for individuals originally from countries like India and Iran and more for English-speaking immigrants. The findings also showed a significant decline in the wage premium from 2010 to 2017."The immigrants’ wage premium that we found in this study might suggest that the demand for these workers outweighs the supply," the author noted.According to the report, easing immigration rules for foreign workers may be very helpful to the US economy and even prevent companies from moving jobs overseas. It further suggested that the US needs to encourage native-born workers to pursue training and education that meets the needs of its labour market.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indians-get-less-wage-premium-in-us-than-english-speaking-immigrants-study-101617300958173.html

There were also reports that the accused brutalised the man. The police, however, refuted these claims. According to police officials in the Tikonia kotwali area, the incident happened on Wednesday night when the victim was practising for an athletics competition outside his house. The victim’s brother, in his complaint to the police, has alleged that the accused, Bramhadeen and his three sons Bharat, Gajraj and Raju, dragged the 22-year-old to their house and beat him up. “Investigations revealed that both parties had a dispute a year ago but they reconciled later,” said Nighasan circle officer Pradeep Kumar Verma. The family members of the victim later found him in the house of the accused and rushed him to a primary health centre, officials said. He was transferred to the district hospital where his condition is stated to be serious, they said. Officials, meanwhile, refuted the reports that the victim was also brutalized. “Such injuries are mentioned neither in the complaint nor in the statement of the victim,” Verma said. “Even the attending doctors were not informed about such injuries by the victim or his relatives,” he added. An FIR under sections 323 and 504 of the Indian Penal Code and relevant sections of the SC/ST Act has been registered against the four accused, Verma said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/four-held-for-beating-up-dalit-man-in-up-101617387964582.html

Two of the four accused have been arrested after the girl named them in a purported suicide note recovered from her room, the officials added.“The suicide note has been sent for forensic examination,” Superintendent of Police Meerut (Rural) Keshav Mishra said. One of the accused and the girl studied at the same tuition, Mishra said, adding that the four accused allegedly accosted her when she was returning home after her tuition class on Thursday evening and raped her. The accused are aged between 18 and 19 years of age, he said. The girl’s family members rushed her to a doctor in the village but later she was taken to a city hospital, the official said. She died during treatment at the hospital on Thursday night, he added. Meanwhile, the last rites of the minor were performed after a post-mortem examination, officials said. The girl’s family could not be reached. A case under Sections 302 (murder) and 376 (rape) was registered late on Thursday night against the accused,” said Mishra. Efforts are on to nab the other two accused, he said. Later, relevant sections of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act and Section 328 of the IPC (causing hurt by means of poison) were also added to the FIR, he added. A political row erupted in the state after the incident. “Crimes against women and girls and Dalits under this government have become uncontrollable. But this government instead of checking the crime against women is busy in hollow publicity of Mission Shakti [campaign for women safety and empowerment] to fool people. But anyway all these failures of this government will come to an end when the people vote this government out in 2022 polls,” said Samajwadi Party state spokesperson Rajendra Chaudhary.“Not aware of exact details of the case, but, all the same, our party government’s focus against crime and criminals is obvious. You saw how dons are now on wheelchair, thinking of ways to avoid coming to UP. In UP law of the land is now supreme. This case that you mention or any other crime case, law will take it’s own course,” said UP BJP secretary ChandramohanIn 2019, UP reported the most number of crimes against women, roughly one every 10 minutes, according to the National Crime Records Bureau. Experts say that uneven law enforcement, feudal attitudes and lack of education contribute to the lack of safety for women.(If you need support or know someone who does, please reach out to your nearest mental health specialist.)

02-04-2021||India||RJD MP writes to Piyush Goyal over contract termination of IRCTC employees||Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) Rajya Sabha MP Manoj Jha on Friday wrote to Union railway minister Piyush Goyal questioning the non-renewal of contracts of hospitality employees of the Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation (IRCTC). This came after the employees took to social media, alleging that they were asked to leave.“These contractual employees gave their best to the Indian Railways even during the peak of the Covid-19. They were actively engaged in the management and supervision of food delivery services in the Shramik special trains run by the Indian Railways,” Jha said in his letter.He said he was writing on behalf of these workers who were hired by the IRCTC on April 23, 2019, for the supervision of catering services, quality inspection in trains as well as catering units of the railways.“To our utter shock, I am informed by these employees from various locations that they have been categorically told by the IRCTC authorities to look for new jobs and that after 20 days they would not be part of the service anymore. The feeble argument from the IRCTC is that they were hired on a two-year contract which is ending now,” he said in the letter.“We all know that the hotel industry is among the worst affected during the Covid crisis, therefore, it is unimaginable for them to be employed by the hotel industry amidst an unprecedented crisis. I remember during an intervention led by me in the budget session of the parliament, you had emphatically assured that nobody shall be terminated from their job. I sincerely request you to please look into the matter with utmost urgency and save the jobs of these hundreds of hospitality supervisors engaged with the IRCTC,” Jha stated.One of the contractual employees, on condition of anonymity, said, their supervisors have given them verbal orders to look for a new job by this month. “On April 23, many supervisors will end their contracts. We have even written letters to the PMO and the railway minister seeking their intervention on the matter,” he said.“Presently, catering services in special trains are limited to sales of ready-to-eat food, packaged drinking water, tea/coffee, et cetera. Base kitchens are non-operational. The scope of work for the hospitality supervisor is very limited. Regarding the period of the contract for these hospitality supervisors, action is being taken as per the terms and conditions of the contract,” an IRCTC spokesperson said.This comes in the backdrop of the decision taken by the national transporter’s catering arm in June last year when it decided to terminate the contract of more than 500 contractual workers. However, its board may reconsider the decision, HT reported on June 30.In a letter to all railway zones dated June 25, the IRCTC informed all its zonal offices that there was no requirement for these contractual workers under the present circumstances and that they should be given one month notice. The IRCTC then said, “The decision to terminate the contracts is currently under reconsideration.”Just a day later, the IRCTC said it decided to put on hold its order to terminate the services of over 500 contractual workers days after it terminated their contracts following an uproar on social media. Several former contractual employees who were handed the termination letter took to social media to seek intervention by railway minister Piyush Goyal.Around 560 supervisors (hospitality) were hired by the IRCTC in 2019 on a contractual basis for two years to maintain a quality check on contractors assigned to cater food in trains equipped with pantries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rjd-mp-writes-to-piyush-goyal-over-contract-termination-of-irctc-employees-101617386464578.html

He did not say whether the transfer had been postponed or cancelled."We had contacted our counterparts in Myanmar, but so far we have not received any response," he said, blaming the breakdown in communications on the aftermath of Myanmar's coup.Tens of thousands of Rohingya, who are largely denied citizenship in their home country Myanmar, have lived in India for years but Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government regards them as a security threat and has been detaining them.The girl and her family were among the hundreds of thousands of Rohingya who fled a Myanmar military-led crackdown in 2017 that UN investigators said was carried out with "genocidal intent" - charges Myanmar denies.The girl's father Mohammed Zaber, who lives in a Rohingya refugee camp in Bangladesh, told Reuters by phone she had left Bangladesh in 2019 and had planned to seek a better life in Malaysia before she was detained en route in India."I appeal to the Indian government to send my daughter to me in Bangladesh," Zaber told Reuters by phone.Indian police official B.L. Meena said the girl would now probably go back to the non-profit group that had been looking after her in the border state of Assam.An Indian foreign ministry spokesperson said he had no comment on the case, and a home ministry spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The UN refugee agency, UNHCR, opposed the deportation, saying on Thursday: "The situation in Myanmar is not yet conducive for voluntary return in a safe, secure, and sustainable manner."India is not a signatory to the UN Refugee Convention and rejects a U.N. position that deporting the Rohingya violates the principle of refoulement – sending refugees back to a place where they face danger.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-halts-deportation-of-16-year-old-rohingya-girl-to-myanmar-101617385087102.html
02-04-2021||India||India condemns violence in Myanmar, calls for restoration of democracy||Against the backdrop of the Myanmar military’s continuing crackdown on civilian protestors opposing the February 1 coup, India on Friday condemned any use of violence and demanded the restoration of democracy in the neighbouring country. More than 500 civilians have been killed in the crackdown by Myanmar’s security forces, many of them when troops fired on crowds, according to the Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP). The military removed the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi and assumed power after claiming that the election held last November was rigged. “Let me be very clear. We condemn any use of violence. We believe that the rule of law should prevail. We stand for the restoration of democracy in Myanmar,” external affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi told a regular news briefing. India has sought the release of political prisoners and supported any attempts at resolving the current situation, including through the efforts of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), he said. “We remain engaged on this issue with our international interlocutors and at the UN Security Council in an effort to play a balanced and constructive role,” Bagchi added. India has forged close ties with both Myanmar’s elected government and the military, especially because of security concerns linked to the northeastern states and efforts to counter China’s influence in the region. As part of its efforts aimed at a balanced approach, India had so far refrained from condemning the Myanmar military’s violence against pro-democracy protestors. At a closed meeting on Myanmar at the UN Security Council on Thursday, India’s permanent representative to the UN, TS Tirumurti, condemned the violence and urged maximum restraint. He also spoke of India’s steadfast commitment to democratic transition in Myanmar and sought the release of detained leaders. While welcoming ASEAN’s efforts to find a solution in Myanmar, Tirumurti said the situation needs to be resolved peacefully through “greater engagement”, while simultaneously ensuring that the hopes and aspirations of the people of Myanmar are met. Asked about India’s presence at the Myanmar Armed Forces Day celebration on March 28, a day when security forces killed more than 110 protestors across the country, Bagchi said: “We have a functioning embassy in Myanmar. Our ambassador, defence attaché and other diplomatic officers continue to discharge their regular diplomatic responsibilities. Nothing more should be read into this event [attended] by our defence attaché.” Bagchi said the issue of Myanmar citizens entering India while fleeing violence in their country is dealt with “as per our laws and humanitarian considerations”. He didn’t give details.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-condemns-violence-in-myanmar-calls-for-restoration-of-democracy-101617384604667.html

"I am absolutely convinced that a strong India with a clear strategy will have no problem in dealing with China," Rahul said.Showing his iPhone, the Congress leader said the world's production battle has been won by China. "I don't see how India and the US are challenging this issue," he said.LIVE: My interaction with Ambassador Nicholas Burns from Harvard Kennedy School. https://t.co/KZUkRnLlDgTalking about Congress reforms, the Congress leader said not only the Congress, but no other party in India is winning elections. Taking the name of the Samajwadi Party, Bahujan Samaj Party, Nationalist Congress Party, he said, "To fight elections, I need institutional structures, I need a judicial system that protects me, I need a media that is reasonably free, I need financial parity, I need a whole set of structures that actually allow me to operate a political party. I don't have them. When one starts behaving like the BJP is doing, many people get discontented. The solution is to bring them together. But we have to remember that we are in a different paradigm now."On the EVM controversy in Assam elections, he said, "In Assam, the gentleman who runs our campaign has been sending videos of BJP candidates running around voting machines in their cars. But there is nothing going on in national media."On the farmers' protest, Rahul Gandhi said the agriculture sector needs to be reformed but it cannot be done without consulting the stakeholders. "When we were in the government, we had constant feedback. It amazes me how quickly we got feedback, whether from farmers, businessmen... That feedback loop is shut now. So farmers have no other way," he said, adding Punjab Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh wrote multiple letters asking the Centre to not pass the laws which have led to the stir.Drawing a parallel between the passage of farm laws in Parliament and the imposition of Coronavirus lockdown in March 2020, Rahul said, "This is all about how you run the country. All this comes from a belief that centralised power understands everything. The issue of lockdown was not discussed in the Cabinet. "On the economic front, Rahul said there is a need to jumpstart consumption in India by giving money in the hand of people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/china-sees-a-weak-india-says-rahul-gandhi-explains-why-congress-is-not-winning-elections-101617382283267.html

A decision to this effect was taken at the TDP politburo meeting held under the leadership of party president and former chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu at Guntur on Friday morning.“For the first time in the last 39 years, the TDP has taken a tough decision to boycott the ZPTC and MPTC elections as we don’t have trust in the SEC. The SEC issued the election notification without consulting the opposition parties which is against the Supreme Court guidelines,” Naidu told reporters in the evening.He pointed out that as per the Supreme Court’s guidelines, the model code should be reimposed four weeks before the notified date of polling. “The SEC issued a notification now, giving just over a week for the polling scheduled for April 8. This is only to favour the ruling YSR Congress party leaders,” Naidu said.The TDP chief said his party was boycotting the election not out of fear but lack of faith in the existing system under the Jagan Reddy regime. “We are forced to fight with criminal elements, who have no faith in democracy, and the police who are abetting the election offences committed by the YSRCP. Yet we will continue our legal fight and we have filed a petition in the high court against the SEC’s latest notification,” he said.Former chief secretary Neelam Sawhney, who took over as state election commissioner (SEC) on Thursday morning following the retirement of her predecessor Nimmagadda Ramesh Kumar a day before, announced the schedule for mandal parishad territorial constituencies (MPTCs) and zilla parishad territorial constituencies (ZPTCs) within hours of assuming charge.She announced the revival of the process for the election of the MPTCs and the ZPTCs, which was abruptly stalled in March 2020 by her predecessor on account of the nation-wide Covid-19 lockdown. The poll process was suspended at the stage of the withdrawal of nominations.In all, there are 660 ZPTCs and 9,984 MPTCs in Andhra Pradesh, of which as many as 126 ZPTCs and 2,363 MPTCs were elected unanimously during the beginning of the election process in March 2020. “The elections for the remaining MPTCs and ZPTCs will be held on April 8 and the results would be declared on April 10. The process would begin from the stage of withdrawal of nominations,” Sawhney declared.In the morning, the TDP along with the BJP, Jana Sena and CPI boycotted the all-party meeting convened by the newly-appointed SEC. The TDP said there was no point in attending the all-party meeting after the SEC unilaterally announced the election schedule for MPTC and ZPTC polls.Congress representative Masthal Wali attended the all-party meeting but walked out within seconds, stating that there was no point in conducting the meeting after the issuance of the election notification.CPI leader K Ramakrishna, who also boycotted the meeting, saying it was surprising why the notification was issued so urgently, without giving sufficient time for the political parties.Only YSRC leader Lella Appi Reddy and CPI(M) leader YV Rao attended the meeting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dont-trust-sec-tdp-boycotts-mptc-zptc-polls-in-andhra-pradesh-101617382024424.html

It lamented that the 11 states that reported 90% of India’s cases over the past 14 days, adding that these ‘states of grave concern’ haven’t “shown a commensurate increase in enforcement of containment activities.”Follow latest updates on Covid-19 hereThese states have crossed or are close to crossing their previous peaks of new cases over the last year, an official statement by the Union health ministry said, describing the situation in Maharashtra as “particularly worrying”.The central government’s sharp message, delivered at a review meeting chaired by Cabinet Secretary Rajiv Gauba and attended by senior central and state government officials, came hours before Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray’s special address to people in the state on the Covid-19 situation.On Thursday, there were 81,413 new infections reported across India, the highest single-day increase since October 1, 2020. The second wave has pushed cases to levels not witnessed in the country in at least six months. India’s highest single-day caseload was 99,181 on September 10, according to the HT dashboard.During the meeting, cabinet secretary Rajiv Gauba pointed out that the current Covid-19 case growth rate of 6.8% in March 2021 has surpassed the previous record of 5.5% in June last year. “The country also reported 5.5% growth rate in daily COVID deaths in this period. While the country was reporting about 97,000 daily new COVID cases at the peak of the pandemic in September 2020, the country has now reached the critical figure 81,000 daily new cases of COVID,” according to the health ministry statement.According to experts and government officials, a massive and widespread inoculation drive is the only chance the country has to turn the tide against the building second wave of infections.For the 11 states reporting upsurge, the government listed five tools including vaccination, enhanced testing, strict containment, prompt contact tracing and enforcement of Covid appropriate behaviour, to curb the spread of the viral disease. Eleven states and UTs that were categorised as “states of grave concern” are Maharashtra, Punjab, Karnataka, Kerala, Chhattisgarh, Chandigarh, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Delhi, and Haryana.The government also told the states to increase testing continuously to ensure that positivity comes down to 5% or less than 5%. It advised them to focus on ensuring RT-PCR tests comprise 70% of total test, reduce waiting time of test results with regular review with testing labs, use Rapid Antigen Tests (RAT) as screening test in densely populated areas and where fresh clusters are emerging, and ensure that all symptomatic RAT negatives are mandatorily subjected to RT-PCR tests.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-advises-11-states-of-grave-concern-on-covid-19-control-measures-101617381281687.html

But if no alternative is found, then the decision will be taken after two days, the CM said, adding, "I am not announcing a lockdown but warning about it".Lockdown is a catch 22 situation as it impacts the economy, Uddhav said, reiterating his stance against lockdown. But stricter restrictions will come soon, he said, giving the details of how cases in the state have been rising while the government is ramping up healthcare facilities, administering vaccines at a fast pace.The second wave of the pandemic is more severe than the first one, the CM said adding that the state lowered its guards of late and crowding was reported at wedding ceremonies and public places.Follow live updates of Uddhav Thackeray's address to Maharashtra peoplePointing out an imminent health care crisis in the state, the CM during his social media live interaction said as cases are rising, there is a scarcity of doctors. "As far as the health infrastructure is concerned, we have been ramping up continuously, but where will we get doctors and healthcare workers? In January, there used to be 350 patients a day. But now, the number has gone up to 8,500 a day," the CM said.The CM also said the state will soon conduct 2.5 lakh tests and 70 per cent of these will be RT-PCR, as recommended by the Centre.This is not the first time that the chief minister warned about lockdown in the state and on Friday, he began his live address saying that there is nothing to panic yet as speculations of a state-wide lockdown were rife after the government announced that Thackeray would address the public through Facebook live.The Maha Vikas Aghadi government is facing resistance in the issue of lockdown. Congress leader Sanjay Nirupam on Thursday attended a silent protest of hotel owners against Maharashtra's night curfew. AIMIM MP of Aurangabad Imtiyaz Jaleel was also spotted in a celebration gathering after the district took back its lockdown order. In an oblique reference to these incidents, Uddhav said all political parties should positively respond to the government's lockdown request if there is any in future. Instead of taking to the streets opposing lockdown, there is a need to help healthcare workers, the CM said.Before the address, the chief minister held a high-level meeting with the officials to review the pandemic situation of Maharashtra. The situation of the state has been moving from bad to worse since the middle of February with daily cases shooting up every day, but the government reiterated that it was not in favour of imposing a lockdown in the state.With more than 50 per cent of the country's active Covid-19 cases being concentrated in the state, the present situation is worse than 2020, when the pandemic was believed to be at its peak. The Centre has also expressed concerns over the worsening Covid-19 situation of the state.The state government earlier instructed district administrations to impose local lockdowns to rein in the spread of the infection. Akola, Amravati, Yavatmal, Nagpur districts have come under restrictions in February and March. The Pune district authorities on Friday announced fresh restrictions on malls, restaurants, asking them to remain shut for seven days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-covid-2nd-wave-much-severe-says-uddhav-thackeray-101617374938624.html
02-04-2021||India||Day after, Imran Khan explains why Pakistan cabinet decided against sugar import||Pakistan can’t have any trade relations with India till New Delhi reviews its 2019 decision to scrap the special status of Jammu and Kashmir, Prime Minister Imran Khan said on Friday while chairing a special meeting to review bilateral ties.The meeting in Islamabad – which was attended by Pakistan’s foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi and Khan’s special assistant on national security and strategic policy Moeed Yusuf – was convened after Pakistan’s Cabinet on Thursday shot down an official proposal to allow imports of cotton and sugar from India to control prices and cope with a shortage.“After the discussions [on Thursday and Friday], the prime minister clearly instructed that Pakistan will not have any kind of trade with India till India reviews the steps it took in [Jammu and Kashmir] on August 5, 2019,” Yusuf told Ary News channel after the meeting.According to Geo News channel, which cited a source, Khan told the meeting, “It is our principled stance not to resume trade with India until the Kashmir issue is resolved”.Any decision on resuming trade with India “will give the wrong impression that Pakistan has neglected the people of Kashmir,” Khan was quoted as saying.Also read: ‘Build on Pangong Lake drawdown, disengage at other points’ - India tells ChinaA Cabinet meeting chaired by Khan on Thursday rejected a decision made a day earlier by the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the Cabinet to allow limited imports from India. Pakistan had unilaterally suspended trade with India in August 2019 to protest the changes in Jammu and Kashmir.On Thursday, Qureshi said that the Cabinet deferred the move to allow imports from India so that there could be more deliberations on the issue. He also said it wouldn’t be possible for Islamabad to normalise bilateral relations till New Delhi reviews its actions on Jammu and Kashmir.Yusuf said the ECC was the forum that decides on all proposals with a commercial angle. “When it goes to the ECC, the committee makes decisions based on economic and commercial considerations,” he said.The matter of imports from India went to the ECC, and “on a commercial basis, it was decided that [cotton and sugar] be imported from India as the prices are lower in India,” he said.The ECC’s recommendation went to the Cabinet, “which is a political and strategic forum” and has the final say in approving such matters, Yusuf noted.“In this case, this issue was discussed though it was not on the Cabinet’s agenda [on Thursday] and the prime minister gave the directive that this decision should be deferred and it should be immediately reviewed because matters involving India are not just about trade and many political and strategic issues are linked with them,” Yusuf said.When external affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi was asked about Pakistan’s flip-flop on resuming trade at a news briefing in New Delhi on Friday, he replied, “We have seen reports on this but as is evident, we are not the right party to whom this question should be directed.”The Khan government’s decision to defer the move to allow cotton imports from India has annoyed Pakistan’s textile sector, Dawn newspaper reported.Pakistan Apparel Forum chairman Jawed Bilwani described the recommendation to allow imports from India as “realistic and the need of the hour”, and said Pakistan’s Cabinet must give it serious consideration. The rejection of the proposal would convey a negative message to foreign buyers as cotton yarn isn’t available in Pakistan, he said.Former ambassador Vishnu Prakash said, "This is just Pakistan being Pakistan, this decision typifies them. They have created so much emotional baggage that draining the swamp isn’t going to be easy. This isn't just about economic considerations but there are emotional and obsessive political factors that are not allowing them to come to terms with reality."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-trade-ties-with-india-till-review-of-2019-decision-on-j-k-imran-khan-101617375424229.html

The central government listed five tools that the states must follow to curb the spread of the viral disease.The tools include vaccination, enhanced testing, strict containment, prompt contact tracing and enforcement of Covid appropriate behaviour, the government said in a statement.Follow latest updates on Covid-19 hereCabinet secretary Rajiv Gauba chaired the meeting and pointed out that the current Covid-19 case growth rate of 6.8% in March 2021 has surpassed the previous record of 5.5% (June 2020), according to the statement. “The country also reported 5.5% growth rate in daily COVID deaths in this period. While the country was reporting about 97,000 daily new COVID cases at the peak of the pandemic in September 2020, the country has now reached the critical figure 81,000 daily new cases of COVID,” it added.Eleven states and UTs that were categorised as “states of grave concern” include Maharashtra, Punjab, Karnataka, Kerala, Chhattisgarh, Chandigarh, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Delhi and Haryana. These have contributed 90% of Covid-19 cases and 90.5% of deaths as of March 31 in the last 14 days, the Centre said, adding, that they “crossed/or close to crossing their early reported peaks during last year.”Highlighting the particularly worrying situation in Maharashtra, state authorities were advised to take up immediate and high effective measures to ensure containment of active cases and daily deaths. Maharashtra recorded a spike of over 43,000 Covid-19 cases on Thursday. This is the highest single-day spike since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic.The government also told the states to increase testing continuously to ensure that positivity comes down to 5% or less than 5%. It advised them to focus on ensuring RT-PCR tests comprise 70% of total test, reduce waiting time of test results with regular review with testing labs, use Rapid Antigen Tests (RAT) as screening test in densely populated areas and where fresh clusters are emerging and ensure that all symptomatic RAT negatives are mandatorily subjected to RT-PCR tests.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-lists-5-tools-for-11-states-reporting-upsurge-in-covid-19-cases-fatalities-101617371804205.html

The CPCB has identified 124 such cities.Coal-fired power plants in the rest of the areas have to comply with the new standards by December 31, 2024, according to the notification.TPPs declared to retire before December 31, 2025, are "not required to meet the specified norms in case such plants submit an undertaking to the CPCB and the CEA (Central Electricity Authority) for exemption on ground of retirement", the notification said.The Environment Ministry had revised emission norms for particulate matter (PM), sulphur dioxide and oxides of nitrogen for TPPs in December 2015, requiring them to install emission control systems by December 2017.The deadline was pushed to December 2022 for all power stations in the country in view of implementation issues and challenges. However, power stations in the national capital region were required to comply with the revised norms by December 2019.Earlier this year, the Ministry of Power requested the Environment Ministry to extend the deadline for meeting emission norms for all thermal plants from 2022 to 2024, citing delay due to various reasons, including the coronavirus pandemic and import restrictions.Major pollutants from coal-fired power plants are oxides of nitrogen (NOx), sulphur dioxide (SO2) and particulate matter (PM).According to the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), TPPs account for more than 60 per cent of total industrial emissions of particulate matter; 45 per cent of SO2; 30 per cent of NOx; and more than 80 per cent of mercury, in the country.These are also responsible for 70 per cent of the total freshwater withdrawal by all industries, according to an analysis by the green think tank.A recent compliance report by CSE showed that out of the 12 power plants located around Delhi, SO2 control technology was available only in two plants.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/environment-ministry-sets-new-deadlines-for-thermal-power-plants-to-meet-emission-norms-101617372802710.html

The state government, reluctant to impose a lockdown straightaway, earlier said that the situation will be reviewed from time to time, while district authorities can take appropriate measures locally. Pune district on Friday has announced stricter restrictions asking eateries, malls, cinema halls and religious places to remain shut for the next seven days.Here is all you need to know about the present Covid-19 situation and restrictions> Maharashtra is reporting the highest number of daily cases, daily deaths and also has the highest number of active Covid-19 cases. Pune district has 64,599 active cases, which is the highest in the country.> Over 50 per cent of the active Covid-19 cases are in Maharashtra.> In Mumbai, malls are resisting the idea of lockdown. The Shopping Centres Association of India said the malls get only 1 per cent of the floating population and bulk of people are found in trains and local markets, PTI reported.> Mumbai mayor Kishori Pednekar has hinted that some restrictions can be imposed, including that of curtaining Mumbai locals. "Train journey might be restricted to only essential services staff only as in the past," the mayor told news agency PTI.> The Maha Vikas Aghadi government is divided over the necessity of another lockdown. Congress leader Sanjay Nirupam on Thursday joined a silent protest of hotel owners.> Nagpur district, which was under lockdown till March 31, on Friday recorded 4,108 Covid-19 cases.> In February and March, several schools in Maharashtra districts, including Palghar, Latur, emerged as hotspots.> The present situation in Maharashtra is worse than what was witnessed during the first peak of the pandemic in 2020.> Though mutant strains of the virus have been found in the state, the Centre has dismissed any link between the mutants and the surge in the Covid-19 cases. Not wearing a mask, flouting social distancing rules, in general, are being blamed for the surge.> It is unlikely that there will be another lockdown, but as Thackeray earlier asked to be prepared for lockdown-like restrictions, stricter curbs across the state are likely.(With Agency Inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mall-owners-want-mumbai-locals-to-be-curtailed-as-covid-cases-rise-10-points-101617371570824.html

The meeting comes hours after a TMC delegation led by Yashwant Sinha met EC officials in Kolkata to complain about “central police forces being partial” towards the BJP.Speaking to a team of reporters outside the ECI office in Delhi, Javadekar while blaming Banerjee for violating the model code of conduct said, “TMC violated the model code of conduct and the West Bengal CM has violated ECI rules, so we have demanded action against her.”Earlier in the day, BJP had filed a complaint with the Chief Electoral Officer of West Bengal for her “repeated threats and intimidation to BJP supporters at a public rally in Goghat, Hooghly.”Javadekar also added that they have demanded action against Stalin for saying that BJP leaders Sushma Swaraj and Arun Jaitley died due to pressure exerted by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The daughters of the two late leaders had taken to social media to hit out at Stalin, yesterday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-delegation-meets-ec-seeks-action-against-mamata-banerjee-and-stalin-101617370803873.html
02-04-2021||India||India’s Myanmar policy won’t work; it’s time to diversify engagement||On March 27, as Colonel Ketan Mohite, India’s defence attaché to Myanmar, shared pleasantries with the Tatmadaw generals at the Armed Forces Day Celebrations in Naypyidaw, men under the command of the generals executed cold-blooded mass murder across the country. India’s formal participation in the event, one day after the state government of Manipur issued a circular (now withdrawn) to return forced migrants from Myanmar, shocked most observers.India’s participation was not meant as an endorsement of the junta’s actions. But it was, understandably, seen as such by the people of Myanmar. The Civil Disobedience Movement bluntly asked: Why did India “shake hands with the generals whose hands are soaked with our blood?” This is an important and urgent question. India, akin to the seven other countries that participated, has calculated that the returns from an anti-junta stand are limited. But the costs—loss of economic connectivity, a counter-insurgency partnership, and ability to counter China—are high.Also Read | Myanmar: Internet blackout widens, protesters vow to keep up the resistancePast experience of failed interventionism after the 1988 coup, and the rewards of sticking with the Tatmadaw during the 2007-08 protests guide this approach. It is treated as necessary realpolitik at the altar of which democratic values that enshrine respect for human rights, freedom of speech, and minority protection may be sacrificed. The developed world’s selective and counterproductive rage is cited as further justification for India’s geopolitical pragmatism.In the long-term, it is argued, India prefers a democratic Myanmar, but in the short-term, it must deal with existing realities. The problem is, in the long-term, everyone is dead. Moreover, Myanmar’s inbred generals have made it a cyclical habit to first introduce meaningless political reforms, which fuel false optimism in every new iteration in the short-term, and then sabotage them at whim.India’s Myanmar dilemma, then, is not about values versus interests. It is a deeper crisis of missing the point on realpolitik itself. Today, Myanmar is on the edge of a State collapse. Its long-standing ethnic insurgencies are intensifying, the Bamar-Buddhist heartland has erupted in protests, and even the Buddhist Sangha has distanced itself from the coup-makers. The junta is not collapsing, but it is under unprecedented pressure.Instead of forcefully repatriating migrants and adopting a one-sided approach favouring the junta, India needs to simultaneously, and quickly, build relations with (and offer support to) other power centres. These include the ethnic armed organisations (EAOs) and the Committee Representing Pyidaungsu Hluttaw (CRPH).Realpolitik, not moral obligations, demands India step up its diversification game and bury inhibitions of angering the generals. If after three decades of a Tatmadaw-centric approach, India has not developed enough leverage with the generals to nudge them into a politically inclusive direction, then continuing on the same path now won’t yield different results. If anything, the junta will privately despise India as a weak neighbour and continue to chide it as being a “NATO” (“No Action, Talk Only”) country.Concerns that such a move risks forcing the junta further into China’s orbit are not compelling. This is largely because pro-China figures are already on the rise within the junta, regardless of India’s restraint, and because the junta, too, wants to keep its options open.China, for its part, has also pursued a multi-stakeholder strategy. But Beijing is neither interested in conflict resolution, nor capable of dealing with socio-political plurality inclusively. Unsurprisingly, it failed to move the needle on the Panglong process and the Rohingya crisis. At most, Beijing hedged its bets in engaging with EAOs, carved out a modern-day protectorate in Wa, and hoped that easy cash-and-loans coupled with a Security Council veto would do the rest.India, despite its nationalist turn, excels in managing diversity. It is the only neighbour that stands a chance, if at all, in working with international interlocutors to find a political solution and end the perpetual cycle of instability in Myanmar. But for that to happen, India needs to widen and deepen engagement with all actors inside the country. The costs of such diversification are relatively low, but the risks associated with not doing it are high.India is not dependent on the Tatmadaw for its counter-insurgency in the Northeast. In the late-1980s and early-1990s, at the peak of the insurgent violence, it was Kachin, Arakanese (Rakhine), and Chin EAOs that helped India effectively counter the Naga and Assamese militants. Instead of continuing non-lethal support for these EAOs, India abandoned them for the generals. Despite this, the Tatmadaw fell short on delivering Indian insurgents, select extraditions notwithstanding.True, the Tatmadaw is important to secure the Kaladan project. But at the rate at which the situation is deteriorating inside Myanmar, and public protests mounting in Mizoram, the chances of translating this project into an economically viable platform looks bleak. Even the Adani group, which has invested in the Yangon port, will be forced to revisit its cost-benefit analysis if the situation persists. Civil strife fosters illicit trade, but doesn’t augur well for licit businesses.In 1988, Rajiv Gandhi made the error of conflating tactics with strategy when India supported anti-junta outfits based on a miscalculation that the junta was collapsing. Since then, India went to the other extreme of courting the generals at the expense of other actors. Instead, what is needed is in-depth diversification of relations with EAOs and CRPH, without cutting channels with Naypyidaw.Myanmar is a neighbour, and this is where one would expect India to be bold, creative, and undertake diplomatic heavy-lifting—precisely because China requires countering, regional economies need oxygen, and because it’s worth trying to save lives.Avinash Paliwal teaches at SOAS, University of London and is the author of My Enemy’s Enemy: India in Afghanistan from the Soviet Invasion to the US Withdrawal The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indias-myanmar-policy-won-t-work-it-s-time-to-diversify-engagement-101617367023781.html

The ministry refused to side with it.“This is clearly an internal exercise of the US government. We are not a party to it. There should be a proper understanding of developments in India,” MEA spokesperson Arindam Bagchi was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.Bagchi was referring to the report released by Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Tuesday that had a long list of significant human rights issues in India. It referred to “unlawful and arbitrary killings” by police; torture by some police and prison officials; “arbitrary” arrests and detentions; “harsh and life-threatening” prison conditions; political prisoners or detainees in certain states.The US report also mentions “restrictions on freedom of expression and the press, including violence, threats of violence, or unjustified arrests or prosecutions against journalists, use of criminal libel laws to prosecute social media speech, censorship, and site blocking”.When asked about the climate summit called by US president Joe Biden, the MEA spokesperson said, “Biden invited PM Modi to attend the climate summit to be held virtually on 22-23 April. PM Modi welcomed his initiative and accepted the invitation,” according to ANI.Bagchi also addressed the ongoing unrest in the neighbouring country Myanmar and asserted that India condemns any use of violence and believes the rule of law should prevail. “We stand for the restoration of democracy in Myanmar. We've urged the release of political prisoners and supported any attempts at resolving the current situation including through efforts of ASEAN,” he was quoted as saying by ANI.On border crossings from Myanmar, the foreign ministry spokesperson said, “we are dealing with it as per our laws and humanitarian considerations.”Amid restrictions to ensure there are enough shots to keep up with the domestic demand, Bagchi clarified that India has not imposed any ban on the export of Covid-19 vaccines, adding, jabs have so far been supplied to more than 80 countries across the world.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/there-should-be-proper-understanding-mea-on-us-report-on-human-rights-101617365142607.html

"We will be reviewing the situation. In future, if the need for a lockdown arises, I will consult before taking any such decision," the Chief Minister said, adding that though it is being considered the second wave in the country, it is the fourth wave for Delhi.An emergency meeting was called at Kejriwal's residence in view of the increasing Covid-19 cases in the city."Cases are spreading fast. This is concerning but there is nothing to panic about. In October, when daily cases were around 3,000-4,000 like it is now, there were many patients in ICU. There were many deaths as well. But this wave is less serious than the previous ones. More people are under home isolation," Kejriwal said.Big spike in Delhi, grim milestone for MumbaiEmphasising three points on testing, tracking, isolating, Kejriwal said, "I am urging with folded hands to bring back masks."Thanking the Centre for allowing any person above the age of 45 years to get the vaccines against Covid-19, Kejriwal urged the government to allow vaccination at a mass level, on a war footing. "When the vaccination drive started, there were apprehensions of side effects and that's why only health facilities were chosen as vaccination centres. But now as the vaccines have been proved to be safe, if the Centre allows us, we can start vaccination at schools and other non-health facilities. We will keep ambulances and other necessary facilities ready," Kejriwal said.He also urged the Centre to open vaccination for all, removing the present clause of 45 years and above.Daily Covid-19 infections in the Capital has been on a steady rise since March 15. From 400 cases per day, the city moved to record 2790 fresh cases on Thursday. On Friday, there are 3,594 infections, the CM said before the bulletin was published.In December 2020, Delhi recorded daily cases as high as this. On December 8, the city recorded 3,188 cases and on December 6, there were 2,706 fresh infections. In November 2020, Delhi's daily cases crossed the 8,000-mark, which was the highest spike ever.Taking early action against another wave, the Delhi Disaster Management Authority has already announced its decision of conducting random testing of travellers coming to Delhi from other states where Covid-19 cases are high.The government has also asked schools in the Capital to continue classes of the new academic year online, instead of calling students to schools.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-lockdown-in-delhi-situation-not-as-serious-as-before-says-kejriwal-101617361321634.html

Moreover, the situation in Myanmar is not good."Several Myanmar nationals of Rohingya origin have been arrested over the past few years in different parts of India for crossing over to the country illegaly, even as they were fleeing persecution.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/assam-tries-to-deport-rohingya-girl-myanmar-refuses-to-accept-101617361454413.html

02-04-2021||India||In post-Covid-19 Bihar, kidney transplants pick up amid fears of infection||Kidney transplants are gradually gathering momentum in Bihar after a gap of nearly six months due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Doctors though are guarded given the second wave of coronavirus infections with the state reporting over 2,000 cases and 13 deaths over the last eight days — the highest single-day spike in cases being 488 on April 1.Bihar reported 12 kidney transplants in the last six months at the four facilities approved by the health department. Doctors had put on hold all such procedures given the high probability of infection among patients on immunosuppressive drugs, after the Centre announced a nationwide lockdown on March 23, last year.The Ruban Memorial Hospital, accredited to the National Accreditation Board of Hospitals (NABH), had done the last such procedure on two patients on March 20. The two male patients — a 34-year-old from Hajipur and a 19-year-old from Patna — were discharged from the hospital on Thursday.“These were our first post-Covid-19 renal transplants since the previous one done at our hospital in 2019,” said Dr Satyajit Kumar Singh, managing director and senior urologist of the Ruban Hospital.Most of the post-Covid-19 renal transplants in the state have been done during the last two months. The Paras HMRI Hospital, accredited to the NABH, did three of them, while the Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (IGIMS), an autonomous institution funded by the state government, and the Ruban Hospital did two each.The Paras HMRI hospital, however, was the first facility in the state to do a renal transplant post Covid-19, when it successfully undertook the procedure last October.“After our last pre-Covid-19 renal transplant in February 2020, we had temporarily stopped doing the procedure at our centre till last September. We gradually re-initiated it, having done one renal transplant in October, two each in November and December last year and three in February this year,” said Dr Syed Asif Rahman, medical superintendent, Paras-HMRI hospital.The IGIMS did its first post-Covid-19 kidney transplant in February and then in March, said Dr Om Kumar, professor and head, department of nephrology.“The first post-Covid-19 renal transplant at IGIMS was done in February on a 24-year-old man from Patna’s Baktiyarpur block and the second in March on a 25-year-old man from Munger. Both are doing fine,” he added.“We have planned another kidney transplant on April 6, but we will wait and watch the trend of Covid-19 infection in the state because we do not want to put the patient and their kidney donors at risk if the coronavirus infection increases in the state,” added Dr Kumar.Dr Pankaj Hans, head, department of nephrology, Ruban Memorial Hospital and an associate professor at the Patna Medical College Hospital, said putting on hold renal transplants was not the solution in the present scenario.“We are much better prepared to tackle the pandemic now and have also gained in experience. Kidney transplant is a better mode of therapy in comparison to dialysis, as the patient’s quality of life improves. We should not deprive those who have donors and are willing to undertake the procedure,” said Dr Hans. He, however, cautioned, that doctors need to be on their guard.“The new strain of the Covid-19 virus may have higher transmissibility but is less severe in terms of mortality rate. We will adopt a cautious approach in doing kidney transplants, given the second wave of Covid-19. We need to be careful with patients taking immunosuppressive drugs and regulate their medicines because they are prone to contracting the infection,” he added.The Ruban Memorial Hospital, which was the first in the state to carry out a successful kidney transplant in 2008, has done 14 such procedures so far.“The state government told us to wait till it framed its own rules, governing organ tissue transplant. We then lost three to four years because of a change in ownership of our hospital and the government rules on the mandatory three-year cooling off period,” said managing director Dr Singh.Ruban Hospital now plans to initiate bone marrow transplant next year. It will also add to its existing capacity of 210 beds and an additional 186 beds in its annexe building next month. In addition, it has 50 existing beds for Covid-19 care that is separate from its main building, and another 50 beds for women and children in the hospital.In terms of kidney transplant, the IGIMS leads the pack in the state, having done 73 procedures so far since it initiated it in 2016. The Paras-HMRI hospital had done 38 after introducing the facility in January 2018.The BIG Apollo hospital hasn’t done any kidney transplant procedure.“We got the government approval to perform kidney transplants only last month. We have the requisite infrastructure in place,” said nephrologist Dr Harsh Vardhan.Quoting statistics, Dr Hans said 1.50 lakh patients required kidney transplant but only 7,500 transplants, on an average, were done in India every year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-post-covid-19-bihar-kidney-transplants-pick-up-amid-fears-of-infection-101617361563564.html

02-04-2021||India||Mohali court rejects Mukhtar Ansari's plea for medical examination||A Mohali court has rejected a plea of gangster-turned-politician Mukhtar Ansari who sought directions to jail authorities to constitute a medical board for examining him.The court of Judicial Magistrate 1st Class (JMIC) Amit Bakshi said the Supreme Court has already considered Ansari's plea regarding his medical condition."There is nothing on record which cab suggest that after the apex court order on March 26 there have been any fresh medical issues with the accused," the Mohali court judge said.No separate order to constitute a board for treatment of the accused is required to be passed, the judge wrote in his March 31 order.Ansari, wanted in Uttar Pradesh for several cases, was on Wednesday produced before the Mohali court in connection with an alleged 2019 extortion matter. He was in a wheelchair when he was brought to the court.Ansari, through his counsel Raj Sumer Singh, had moved a plea in the court for directing the jail authorities to get him medically examined due to "acute ailments and medical distress".The counsel had also claimed that the accused suffered "medical" emergency on March 29, 2020 and since then he has been suffering from "acute chest pain".Ansari had a previous medical condition and had also suffered two major heart attacks. It was feared that if he was denied proper medical assistance, he might succumb to his medical ailments, it was further submitted.The counsel had also sought a reply from the Rupnagar jail superintendent before deciding the application.The counsel also mentioned in the plea while referring to the March 26 Supreme Court order that as the MLA from Mau had to travel to Uttar Pradesh, keeping in view his medical condition, he be treated through a recognized government medical hospital in Mohali by constituting a board.The Mohali court judge in his order said, "No reply on behalf of the jail superintendent would be required as the jail superintendent was duty bound as per law to provide appropriate medical facility to the accused as per his medical condition (if any), as per the jail manual and also to comply with the order dated March 26 of the apex court."The court also directed that as Ansari is in judicial custody in the present case, therefore, the jail superintendent, at the time of transferring the custody of the accused to UP as per directions of the apex court, will mention that he be produced through video conferencing on April 12 in the present case.Ansari has been lodged in Rupnagar district jail in Punjab since January 2019 in connection with an alleged extortion case.On March 26, the Supreme Court directed the Punjab government to hand over the custody of Ansari to the Uttar Pradesh Police, saying the custody was being denied on trivial grounds under the guise of medical issues.The apex court had also said that a convict or an undertrial prisoner, who disobeys the law of the land, cannot oppose his transfer from one prison to another and the courts should not be a helpless bystander when the rule of law is being challenged with impunity.A bench of Justices Ashok Bhushan and R S Reddy had said the custody of Ansari be handed over to Uttar Pradesh within two weeks so as to lodge him in Banda District Jail in UP.The apex court also noted that Ansari was allegedly involved in several cases of attempt to murder, murder, cheating and conspiracy apart from offences under the Gangsters Act, which were lodged in Uttar Pradesh. Out of these cases, 10 are at the stages of trial.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mohali-court-rejects-mukhtar-ansari-s-plea-for-medical-examination-101617359008484.html
02-04-2021||India||How India aims to boost its indigenous defence capabilities in two years||In what will provide a fillip to the government’s self reliance campaign and the domestic defence ecosystem, and boost Indian fighting capabilities, the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) is gearing up to provide the Indian military with a dozen new indigenous weapons and systems over the next two years, DRDO chief G Satheesh Reddy said on Friday.The weapon systems that will be delivered to the military between 2021 and 2023 to strengthen its capabilities include beyond visual range (BVR) missiles, India’s first anti-radiation missile, anti-tank weapons, anti-drone systems, guided bombs and anti-airfield weapons, the government told Parliament in March.Several of these systems were tested last year when India demonstrated its indigenous weapon-development capability to the world at a time when the border row with China in eastern Ladakh was at its peak. India has set aside ₹70,221 crore—63% of the military’s capital budget for 2021-22—for buying locally-produced weapons and systems to boost defence indigenisation. Last year, the defence ministry spent over ₹51,000 crore, or 58% of the capital budget, on domestic purchases.Boosting indigenisation “These systems that have been developed and others that are under development will significantly boost indigenous capabilities in development and production of weapons. We are moving towards achieving the goal of Aatmanirbharta (self-reliance) in the defence sector. And all this is happening at a time when we are progressively banning the import of military hardware through the positive indigenisation list (earlier called negative import list),” Reddy said.Last year, the government notified a negative import list that sought to ban the import of 101 types of weapons, systems and ammunition over the next five years to promote self-reliance. This year, the government is set to notify a second list of weapons, systems and ammunition that cannot be imported. The list of weapons banned for import will be reviewed every year and more items will be added to it, officials familiar with the matter said.In February, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said it may be described as a negative list, but it is a positive list in the language of self-reliance. “It is a positive list on the strength of which our own manufacturing capacity is going to increase. This is a positive list that will create jobs in India… This is a positive list as it guarantees that products made in India will be sold in India,” Modi said.That statement by PM led the negative import list to be rechristened the positive indigenisation list. According to official data, DRDO has undertaken 79 projects worth ₹8,201 crore during the last three years. These include different types of missiles, gun systems, ammunitions, radars and electronic warfare systems.Nailing delivery timelines DRDO, which has acquired the reputation of long delays in delivery, is hoping to nail its delivery timelines so that the armed forces are not kept waiting for the new weapons and systems. The defence ministry specified the delivery timelines for different systems in Parliament on March 22.The Astra BVR missile and the anti-drone system will be made available to the armed forces this year. The systems that the military can expect next year include the quick reaction surface to air missile system (QRSAM) to protect armoured columns from aerial attacks, the Nag and Helina anti-tank missiles with an effective range of five km, and the air defence fire control radar (ADFCR) that form a key part of a ground-based air defence system in conjunction with anti-aircraft guns.While the Nag missile is launched from a modified infantry combat vehicle (called the Nag missile carrier or Namica), the Helina or helicopter-based Nag is for mounting on the Dhruv advanced light helicopter.India’s first anti-radiation missile, Rudram, will be ready for induction into service by 2023 and boost the Indian Air Force’s capabilities to knock out enemy radars and surveillance systems. The smart anti-airfield weapon (SAAW) will also be ready in two years. SAAW is a precision strike weapon that can be used to target enemy airfield assets such as radars, bunkers, taxi tracks and runways. Indigenously developed by the DRDO’s research centre Imarat, the weapon has a range of 100km. It has been test-fired from the IAF’s Jaguar fighter planes and the upgraded Hawk Mk-132 trainer aircraft.It is good that timelines have been set and DRDO is working towards achieving them, said Air Vice Marshal Manmohan Bahadur (retd), additional director general, Centre for Air Power Studies.“The scientists have their work cut out so that capability gaps that have crept in—for instance, in the BVR space—are quickly made up and the IAF gains the upper hand again. The same applies to ground and naval systems. Our adversaries, especially China, are committing huge funds into defence R&D—we can lag behind only at our peril,” said Bahadur.The weapons systems of the future DRDO is working on a raft of other weapons and systems that will be inducted into service in the coming years, Reddy said. It is developing a new air-launched missile capable of knocking out enemy tanks from a stand-off distance of more than 10km.The indigenous missile, named stand-off anti-tank missile (SANT), is expected to be mated to the IAF’s Russian-origin Mi-35 attack helicopters to arm them with the capability to destroy enemy armour from an improved stand-off range. The existing Russian-origin Shturm missile on the Mi-35 can target tanks at a range of 5km.Key tests conducted by India last year included the supersonic missile-assisted release of torpedo (SMART) to target submarines at long ranges and a new version of the nuclear-capable hypersonic Shaurya missile with a range of 750km.India is also developing a new class of ultra-modern weapons that can travel six times faster than the speed of sound (Mach 6) and penetrate any missile defence. In early September 2020, DRDO also carried out a successful flight test of the hypersonic technology demonstrator vehicle (HSTDV) for the first time.Only the United States, Russia and China have developed technologies to field fast-manoeuvring hypersonic missiles that fly at lower altitudes and are extremely hard to track and intercept.The road aheadImports have traditionally accounted for 60-65% of the country’s military requirements, with India signing contracts worth billions of dollars over the last 10 years for fighter jets, air defence missile systems, submarine hunter planes, attack helicopters, heavy-lift choppers and lightweight howitzers.But India’s arms imports fell 33% between 2011-15 and 2016-20, said a report released by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) on March 15.The report on international arms transfers attributed the drop in India’s arms imports mainly to an attempt to reduce its dependence on Russian arms and complex procurement processes. India’s top three arms suppliers during 2016-20 were Russia (accounting for 49% of India’s imports), France (18%) and Israel (13%), the report said.According to Sipri, India accounted for 0.2% of the share of global arms exports during 2016-20, making the country the world’s 24th largest exporter of major arms. This represents a jump of 228% over India’s export share during the previous five-year period - 2011-15. Myanmar, Sri Lanka and Mauritius were the top recipients of Indian military hardware.Sipri, however, said India’s military imports were likely to grow over the next five years. “As India perceives increasing threats from Pakistan and China and as its ambitious plans to produce its own major arms have been significantly delayed, it is planning large-scale programmes for arms imports. Based on its outstanding deliveries of combat aircraft, air defence systems, ships and submarines, India’s arms imports are expected to increase over the coming five years,” the report said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/how-india-aims-to-boost-its-indigenous-defence-capabilities-in-two-years-101617358023279.html

With this steady spike, the question of imposing fresh restrictions becomes imminent. Some state governments have already started responding to the situation.Fresh restrictions have been announced in these areas:ChhattisgarhChhattisgarh on Thursday reported 4,617 fresh infections in its highest single-day spike since the outbreak of the pandemic in 2020 March. Raipur and Durg are the worst-hit districts with 1,327 and 996 new cases, respectively — in the last 24 hours.> Durg district administration has announced a complete lockdown in the district from April 6 to 14.> There is a strict night curfew order in many of Chhattisgarh districts, including Raipur. This was imposed in March. Under these, all shops are allowed to function between 6am to 9pm, while restaurants, dhabas, hotels can remain open between 8am and 10pm.> Chhattisgarh secretariat and directorate offices have been instructed to function with 50 per cent staff strength, as many government staff contracted the infection in the past few days.Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel on Thursday directed district authorities to decide on imposing lockdowns, following which the Durg administration announced the fresh restrictions on Friday.MaharashtraAll districts of Maharashtra have already been placed under a night curfew till April 15.Pune district, which has 64,599 active Covid-19 cases, the highest in the country at present, has on Friday ordered all bars, hotels and restaurants to remain closed for seven days, starting from tomorrow.There will be a 12-hour night curfew in Pune from April 3, 6pm.Pune district has also prohibited the gathering of more than five persons.In Nagpur, which was under lockdown till March 31, restrictions have been withdrawn and Maharashtra's Aurangabad district has taken back a lockdown decision recently.Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray is likely to announce stricter curbs on Friday.Madhya PradeshChhindwara, Ratlam, Betul and parts of Khargone districts in Madhya Pradesh have been put under lockdown, which will start from Friday night.

02-04-2021||India||Covid-19 second wave in India may peak by mid-April, say scientists||Scientists have predicted using a mathematical model that the ongoing second-wave of Covid-19 pandemic across the country could peak by mid-April, following which the infections may see a steep decline by the end of May.During the first wave of Covid-19 infections across India, the mathematical approach, named SUTRA, predicted that the initial surge of infections in August would peak by September and lower in February 2021.Scientists, including Manindra Agrawal from Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kanpur, applied the model to predict the trajectory of the current surge in infections and found that the number of daily new infections is likely to peak in mid-April for this ongoing pandemic wave."For the last several days, we have found that there is a reasonable chance that the cases in India could peak sometime between 15-20 April. It is a sharp slope, but on the way down, it would likely be equally sharp, coming down very fast and by end of May may see a dramatic reduction," Agrawal told PTI."There is some uncertainty in predicting the peak value of daily new infections because of the sharp rise. Currently, it is coming to 1 lakh infections per day, but this can go up or down. But the timing remains the same between April 15-20," he added.The scientists predict that in the current wave, the first state to peak could be Punjab in a few days, followed by Maharashtra.However, the IIT Kanpur professor added that the model's prediction of the new peak is sensitive to the daily new infections data."Even a little bit of change each day causes the peak numbers to change by several thousand numbers. But the location of the peak has remained on mid-April," he added.Independent calculations made by scientists, including Gautam Menon from Ashoka University in Haryana, have also predicted that the peak of the ongoing wave of infections could be between mid-April and mid-May.However, Menon cautioned that such projections of Covid-19 cases should really be trusted only in the short term."Any excessively precise prediction, of a peak within just a 5-day window, would ignore the many uncertainties associated with the inputs to any such calculation," Menon, who was not involved in the SUTRA modelling, told PTI.Agrawal noted that the model uses three main parameters to predict the course of the pandemic."The first is called Beta, or contact rate, which measures how many people an infected person infects per day. It is related to the R-naught value, which is the number of people an infected person spreads the virus to over the course of their infection," Agrawal explained.The other two parameters, he explained are 'Reach', which is a measure of exposure level of the population to the pandemic, and 'Epsilon' which is the ratio of detected and undetected cases."The reason we had to introduce 'Reach' is that unlike earlier pandemics which start at a location and suddenly spread fast across a place, in Covid, the spread of the pandemic has been slower due to the many protective measures in place," Agrawal explained.The mathematician said 'Epsilon' helps factor in the number of asymptomatic infections across the country."Since the detected cases are quarantined, we assume they no longer contribute to new infections. So a growing number of daily new cases, reflect larger undetected infections. By measuring the number of new cases each day, we try to estimate the undetected and asymptomatic infections," Agrawal explained.He added that the model relies on inputs from daily reported new infections, based on which the value of the three main parameters are inferred."We learn everything from the daily-infections data. The beta value across India has gone up by 50 per cent in March, which indicates that a combination of factors -- people becoming more relaxed, and more infectious variants going around. But precisely what reason this could be is something biologists have to say," the scientist noted.While the model did not previously predict a second-wave in India, he said it could have been due to a change in the parameters sometime between February and March 2021."So clearly during this time some parameters had changed. So we had to wait for some time to collect new data and see how the parameters had changed, which we now know," Agrawal said.On Friday, India recorded 81,466 new infections in a span of 24 hours -- the highest single-day rise in cases since October 2, 2020 -- taking the Covid-19 tally of cases to 1,23,03,131, according to the Union Health Ministry data.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-second-wave-in-india-may-peak-by-mid-april-say-scientists-101617355491356.html

HT has reviewed the letter.The ministry said bonded labourers “are often given drugs, for making them work for long hours in the fields, which adversely affects their mental and physical condition”.“Keeping in view the multi-dimensional and overwhelming enormity of the problem, which involves human trafficking, bonded labour and human rights violation, you are requested to look into the matter and take appropriate measures to address the serious problem,” the ministry said, while asking the state government to give an action taken report on the matter on “priority”.The MHA has also marked the matter to Union ministry of labour and employment, asking it to issue suitable instructions to all states - especially Bihar, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha -- for generating awareness among the masses, at various levels of the states, to ensure that poor and vulnerable victims are not duped by unscrupulous elements with false promises for better job prospects and remuneration etc.Also Read | Focus on test-track-treat protocol: MHA to statesThe details of the disturbing trend have been shared on the basis of people apprehended from border villages of Gurdaspur, Amritsar, Ferozepur and Abohar in Punjab in 2019 and 2020.

02-04-2021||India||What Rahul Gandhi can learn about Congress leadership from his family||The Congress lost elections under three of its most important leaders—Indira, Rajiv and Sonia Gandhi; their policies were critiqued, and their decisions put under a scanner. But never did their peers and party persons consider them “unfit” to lead the party.This story—of faith in the leadership, especially if that leadership belonged to the Nehru-Gandhi family—has since ended. Or so it appears.The Congress today is in the middle of a crisis that makes the post-Emergency isolation of Indira Gandhi in the late 1970s, and Rajiv Gandhi’s diminished political standing in the face of the Bofors gun kickback allegations in the mid-1980s, seem like minor hiccups. The party’s electoral slide in the aftermath of the pulverising 2014 defeat has been steep with scant signs of an early recovery.Voices within have risen over the Nehru-Gandhi family’s force-multiplier utility, the public lure that was their USP. If the outcome of ongoing elections to five state legislatures, notably Kerala, Assam and Puducherry, brings no happy tidings, the rising dissent could well transform into revolt. Whether Rahul Gandhi contests organisational polls, scheduled for the summer, a defeated lead campaigner in popular elections will be a lame-duck party president. “Unfit to lead the party” is actually the phrase certain Congress functionaries use in private conversations.Also Read | PM Modi helps only corporate giants, ignores poor: Rahul Gandhi in KeralaThe sentiment is a mix of pique and pragmatism. Since Indira Gandhi’s days, the family’s hold over the Congress has been directly proportional to their hold on the electorate. Her scions inherited the mantle on the promise of restoring or sustaining the party in power. And in turn, they commanded the loyalty of the party. This fundamental contract, in some senses, between the family and the party is today under strain. The family’s ability to get votes is in doubt, and thus, the loyalty of elements in the party to the family is becoming tenuous.But this is not the first time that a leader is grappling with a power transition, and perhaps it is by returning to history—of his own family and party—that Rahul Gandhi can determine the future.How Indira Gandhi ousted the old guard Indira Gandhi earned her spurs not merely as the daughter of Jawaharlal Nehru. The name helped, but she fought and won against Morarji Desai to be elected leader of the Congress Parliamentary Party after Lal Bahadur Shastri’s death in 1966. That was in the run-up to the general elections a year later, in which she bypassed the powerful syndicate comprising Desai, K Kamaraj, S Nijalingappa, Atulya Ghosh and N Sanjeeva Reddy, for a direct connect with the people.Widely perceived as a watershed moment in Indian politics, the 1967 polls were the last time when elections were simultaneously held to the state assemblies and the Lok Sabha. The Congress retained power at the Centre with reduced numbers but was voted out in nine states. It even lost its majority in Uttar Pradesh with Charan Singh leading a set of defectors to put together a non-Congress coalition.With Desai, the syndicate’s beachhead in the government, challenging her political and policy moves as the deputy Prime Minister, Indira Gandhi hit back at the old guard in the 1969 presidential polls, necessitated by the demise of the incumbent Zakir Hussain. Unwilling to back VV Giri, the vice-President who, ex officio, became the acting president, the syndicate put up then Lok Sabha speaker Sanjeeva Reddy for the top constitutional office.Indira Gandhi smelt a conspiracy and read the syndicate’s move as a precursor to her ouster as the PM, more so because her proposal to field Dalit heavyweight, Jagjivan Ram, as the head of State was voted down by the old-guard-controlled Congress parliamentary board. How she outmanoeuvred the powerful syndicate by lending her weight to Giri’s independent candidature against the official party nominee is now history.Also Watch | Rahul Gandhi says ‘I’m not Modi’, Amit Shah says ‘you’re tourist’ in AssamReddy’s defeat in the presidential election became the reason, eventually, for the party’s 1969 split. Indira Gandhi’s resultant minority Congress (Requisionists) government survived with the support of the Left and the DMK. But it was the failure of the Jana Sangh-Swatantra Party-Socialist amalgam of the Samyukta Vidhayak Dal dispensations in states, the 1971 elections with the Garibi Hatao slogan to counter the Indira Hatao plank of the Opposition, and the Bangladesh war that established her credentials as the paramount leader of her party and the country.Indira Gandhi had won. But the concomitant centralisation of decision-making, which began under her but continued even after her demise, disempowered the party’s regional faces. Its crippling effect has been evident in recent decades in the party’s diminishing federal appeal.How, and why, Sonia Gandhi worked with the veteransBut, perhaps, more instructive for Rahul Gandhi are parallels closer in history. Unlike her mother-in-law, who directly took on the old guard, Sonia Gandhi worked with the veterans.Her willingness to be an attentive listener to party elders fetched her acceptability, besides the image of being a consensus builder. As the late Pranab Mukherjee once recalled to this writer: “She had her way when she wanted because, on other occasions, she went by the advice she got.”It was perhaps for this reason that Sonia Gandhi could install Manmohan Singh as Prime Minister in 2004, bypassing veterans such as Mukherjee, Arjun Singh and ND Tiwari.Sonia Gandhi did face a challenge. The Sharad Pawar-led rebellion against her, on the grounds of her foreign origin, was marked by a split. But this was effectively obliterated with the party’s return to power under her stewardship from 2004-14, in which Pawar was an important and powerful minister, even though the two parties retained independent identities.But the fact that Sonia Gandhi, largely, had a cordial relationship with party veterans makes one wonder whether she had learnt from her husband, Rajiv Gandhi’s run-in with the old guard, notably Kamalapati Tripathi.Under Rajiv, the confrontationIndira Gandhi had made Tripathi, a veteran UP leader, the Congress working president in 1983. But Tripathi’s “a-letter-a-day” pushback on the state of the party, targeted Rajiv Gandhi and was deeply embarrassing for the young Prime Minister.Others who had joined the internal party debate at the time included Communist-turned-Congressman, Chimanbhai Patel, and a former socialist from Maharashtra, Vasant Sathe, who rose to prominence in the Congress after the 1979 split led by Karnataka’s Devaraj Urs over Sanjay Gandhi’s re-emergence. The notes they penned to one another and Tripathi’s own letters to Rajiv covered a gamut of issues—downsides of the Punjab and Assam accords; the leadership’s handling of la affaire VP Singh; centralised nomination of leaders of state legislature parties; the lateral entry of civil servants in the party; marginalisation of time-tested leaders such as Mukherjee, Gundu Rao and AP Sharma and patronage of leaders who deserted an out-of-power Indira Gandhi in the 1970s.Blindsided by Rajiv Gandhi who appointed Arjun Singh as party vice-President, Tripathi indeed was an angry octogenarian. But his communications are a study in political foresight. He detected early the organisational atrophy that has since spread far and wide.The lesson inherent in Rajiv’s face-off with the widely venerated pandit from Varanasi was relevant for all times—don’t trifle around with party seniors in the twilight of their innings, given their vast ability to queer the pitch. The Tripathi papers stored at the Nehru Memorial Library have rare insights, and can still serve as a veritable ready reckoner on how to run the party organisation.The institutional lesson for Rahul Gandhi No matter who gets to hold the party’s reins in the promised organisational polls, the Congress’s institutional memory is relevant despite the vastly altered political landscape. It shouldn’t lie in disuse. The party, at once, needs both a major surgery and deep healing. Complacency, even in the event of a good showing in the state polls, would be unwise.The ginger group—or G-23, as the letter writers came to be known, though whether all 23 remain a part of the group is uncertain—that had raised the red flag on organisational matters to Sonia Gandhi might lack the gravitas of Tripathi or those who constituted the syndicate Indira Gandhi decimated in the sixties. But they should be co-opted, rather than hounded. The template could be Indira Gandhi’s re-nomination of Chandrashekar, the party Young Turk who fiercely opposed monopoly-capital, to the Rajya Sabha in 1968. The episode has been vividly detailed by the present Rajya Sabha deputy chairperson Harivansh in his book Chandrashekhar: The last icon of ideological politics.Indira Gandhi’s battle and victory against the Syndicate, the challenge to Rajiv Gandhi from the veterans, and Sonia Gandhi’s ability to work with party elders for consolidating and shepherding the Congress to power are disparate political experiences. But they are joined by a common story—of establishing leadership methods in the grand old party. Rahul Gandhi may want to heed these lessons.Post script: The defiant notes one picks up these days within the Congress are reminiscent of what Indira Gandhi heard to her chagrin, in her years of oblivion, from Devaraj Urs and others who broke away from the Congress. She had the guile and the mass connect to disprove her detractors’ prophecies of her political irrelevance, without yielding to their demand to distance the party from her younger son, Sanjay Gandhi.The current situation has similarities, the saving grace for the leadership being that the Congress chief ministers haven’t joined the dissidents in words or in action. But as the old adage goes, nothing is permanent in politics. The uncertainty is greater when the leadership’s connect with the masses is in doubt.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/what-rahul-gandhi-can-learn-about-congress-leadership-from-his-family-101617353643194.html

02-04-2021||India||2 held in Telangana for torturing boys on suspicion of Mango theft||Two men were arrested in Telangana’s Mahabubabad district for allegedly beating up two teenagers, tying them up with a rope, stuffing their mouths with buffalo dung before smearing it on their faces believing them to be mango thieves. This incident occurred at Bothala Thanda (tribal hamlet) on the outskirts of Thorrur town on Thursday evening. A video of the torture, apparently shot by an onlooker, went viral in social media followed by the parents of the boys lodging a police complaint. “We have arrested Banothu Yaku of Bothala Thanda and Banothu Ramulu of Hatchu Thanda, who were hired to guard the mango orchard. We shall produce them in the court later in the day,” Thorrur sub-inspector of police Ch Nagesh told HT. The accused were booked under sections 342 (wrongful confinement), 324 (voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapons or means) and 504 (intentional insult and provocation) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and Section 75 of the Juvenile Justice Act (Punishment for cruelty to Child). SI Nagesh quoted from the complaint to say that the boys, in the age group of 12-13 years, entered the mango orchard in search of their missing pet dog but were caught by the guards of the orchard on the suspicion that they were planning to steal mangoes. The video clip shows the two men tying the boys up with a rope and beating them with a stick, without heeding to their cries of innocence. Even as the boys were crying, one of the guards brought some dung and stuffed it into their mouths, while the other guard encouraged him. Later, the two accused also smeared the boys’ faces with dung. As the video went viral, local youth brought it to the notice of Mahabubabad collector V P Gautam and superintendent of police (SP) Nandyal Koti Reddy, who immediately ordered a probe into the incident. “We took the two guards into custody late in the night and questioned them. We formally arrested them on Friday morning and shall send them to judicial remand,” the SI said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2-held-in-telangana-for-torturing-boys-on-suspicion-of-mango-theft-101617352263001.html

In recent days, France has come around to acknowledging the central role that New Delhi can play in the shared commitment to freedom of navigation in the South China Sea.It is in recognition of the role that New Delhi can play that France decided to hold the La Pérouse joint naval exercise in the Bay of Bengal on April 4-7, and invited the Indian Navy to the wargame. The joint exercise, first held in 2019, earlier included navies from the other tmembers of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue or Quad: Australia, Japan and the US.“This (trilateral dialogue) will be a meeting of middle powers, who have democratic polity and have the economic strength and shared values to help each other in terms of trade and technology,” said a senior Indian official.The three foreign ministers will discuss the global security environment and the Chinese posture in the Indo-Pacific.French envoy Christophe Penot, who is an advisor to President E Marcon on Indo-Pacific, signalled the pivotal role that Paris expects New Delhi to play in the region when he briefed top diplomatic corps and heads of multilateral agencies in Paris this week. It is understood that Penot in his virtual briefing outlined the role of France, Australia and India in the Indo-Pacific with particular emphasis on New Delhi’s role in the efforts.A former foreign secretary linked the emphasis on India to the government’s decision to stand up to China when it tried to expand its territory across the Line of Actual Control.Also Read: Quad, France and UAE join hands in 2 naval exercises to dominate Indo-Pacific“After India led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi stood up to unilateral aggression by the People’s Liberation Army in East Ladakh in May 2020, not only Quad powers but key strategic allies, France and UK, recognise the centrality of India in ensuring the right to free navigation in the Indo-Pacific,” the retired diplomat said.Officials said it has helped that foreign ministers Jaishankar, Drian and Payne have a personal connect with each other apart from being representatives of democratic powers that have been brought under pressure by Chinese behaviour in East Ladakh, Caledonia and island territories, respectively, in the far Pacific.While India and France have deep defence cooperation with each other, Australia under Prime Minister Scott Morrison has joined hands with New Delhi on not only pushing the pedal on bilateral ties but also close military ties through multilateral naval exercises such as Malabar 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-france-australia-trilateral-meet-on-april-13-indo-pacific-on-agenda-101617350103103.html

02-04-2021||India||NCB red-flags Mumbai as cocaine capital of India||The Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) has red-flagged Mumbai as the cocaine capital of India saying that other metropolitan cities are not lagging behind with the drug mafia spreading its tentacles in India, Canada and Australia. As much as 2499 kilograms of cocaine seized in the past two years in Sri Lanka, Port Elizabeth and Panana had India as its destination. The international market for this lethal drug is ₹5 crore per kilogram.As one of the biggest manufacturers of potassium permanganate, a precursor chemical, there is a growing suspicion that the processing of cocaine may be shifted by drug cartel from South America to India. This is primarily due to the US Drug Enforcement Agency, the UK’s National Crime Agency, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) and Australian drug enforcement agencies pressure on the South American coca-producing countries.According to top NCB officials, backtrack drug investigations have now confirmed that no less than 300kg of cocaine (worth ₹1500 crore in the international market) landed in Mumbai in December 2018 through a syndicate with links in India, Australia and Canada. The same syndicate was involved in the smuggling of 200kg of methamphetamine from Canada to Australia.With all the drug enforcement agencies pooling their intelligence and resources on this network (not disclosed as it is an ongoing operation), as much as 20kg of cocaine was seized in India, 29kg of methamphetamine was recovered in the US, 55kg of cocaine and 200kg of methamphetamine was seized in Australia.According to NCB, the syndicate was uncovered after an Indian internet protocol was involved in the smuggling of 200kg of methamphetamine from Canada to Australia. The said IP address was traced to one Akshinder Singh Sodhi of Punjab, who was later arrested with 422kg of cocaine in India.The backtrack investigations of 55kg of cocaine concealed in a plasma cutting machine seized in Australia in June 2019 led the NCB to uncover the syndicate bases in India. Investigations revealed that the drug syndicate had floated fake companies for the drug to be smuggled and then concealed at Rudrapur in Uttarakhand. Working on this intelligence, the NCB conducted raids in Rudrapur, Ghaziabad, UP, Punjab and Delhi to cumulatively seize 20kg of cocaine with a number of arrests in these states including Indonesian and Nigerian nationals.NCB investigations into the smuggling of 300kg of cocaine in Mumbai led to the arrests of mastermind Harpal Singh aka Amrinder Chenna aka Laadhi and his associate Sandeep Deol, who arranged all the paperwork and logistics while in India during the landing of the drug. The other members of this syndicate have been identified with the accused both in India and Canada.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ncb-red-flags-mumbai-as-cocaine-capital-of-india-101617347061903.html

In other areas, the stone itself crumbles into powder upon touching and the dust accumulates on the ground,” Rector of the Basilica Fr Patricio Fernandes, a Jesuit priest, said. “Due to its exposed laterite exterior and other factors like the rapid urbanisation of Old Goa and the unseasonal rain all through the year, the walls of the Basilica remain wet. The laterite stone gets saturated so much that the water even starts dripping through the inside walls. This never happened in the past,” he adds. The Jesuit church, which was consecrated in May 1605, is India’s first minor basilica, and is considered to be one of the best examples of baroque architecture and Portuguese Colonial architecture in India. It is also one of the Seven Wonders of Portuguese Origin in the World. The Basilica was fully plastered like every other church in Goa and remained so for close to 350 years since its inauguration in 1605 till the early 1950s and bore a white look owing to its limestone plaster. However, in the early 1950s ‘conservation’ architects from Portugal (of which Goa was then still a part of) had it removed as part of propaganda initiated by the Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Salazar and the Estado Novo state.“The Estado Novo came to power in Portugal in the 1930s promising an economic and cultural renewal of Portugal and its overseas territories. They began renovating monuments in Portugal and their overseas territories to make them look more ancient so as to reflect the values of the regime. They sent an archaeological mission from Portugal led by the Portuguese architect and restorer Baltazar de Castro to renovate the monuments of Old Goa for the exposition of St Francis Xavier in 1952,” Fr Fernandes added. “The architectural renovations in Old Goa were a means to prove just how rooted the Portuguese presence in Goa was. These acts of political propaganda masquerading as architectural conservation were done without consultation with Goan experts or the public at large. The Basilica has been dying a slow death ever since,” he said. The Church authorities have now begun a consultation process with experts from the Archaeological Society of India (ASI) as well as conservation trusts to try and stall the deterioration of the building. “Various experts in the country and abroad have said that lime plastering of the exposed surface of the Basilica is the only time tested solution to conserve it. If we want to conserve the Basilica, we have to re-plaster the exterior to avoid a major tragedy in the future,” Fr Fernandes said. The authorities said they earlier feared that an attempt to change the look of the monument would be met with resistance simply because of how people have gotten used to seeing it. “The reaction has been very encouraging so far with all the feedback we have received asking us to do whatever it takes to help preserve the Basilica,” Fr Fernandes said. The Church has now formed a committee of experts and authorities, who in consultation with the ASI, will decide the next steps including a thorough study on the damage done so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goas-basilica-of-bom-jesus-could-lose-iconic-red-look-to-conserve-the-structure-101617342902787.html

It is also among the eight states which account for 84.61% of the daily new Covid-19 cases and continue to show a steep rise in the tally.Yesterday, the state had reported as many as 43,183 new Covid-19 cases and 249 deaths in a mere span of 24 hours. This accounted for both the highest one-day rise since the pandemic began, as well as the highest number of deaths since October last year.To combat the intensifying threat, chief minister Thackeray has declared a state-wide night curfew from Sunday under the Maharashtra government's 'Mission Begin Again' program. Officials are also considering stricter control measures, including shutting down religious places and restricting train travel, according to ANI.The administration is also mulling over another potential shutdown, although no official announcement has yet been made in this regard. It may not decide to impose a "blanket lockdown", but stricter curbs might be implemented in a phased manner, an official said, adding that the state government is likely to decide on shutting down restaurants, hotels, theatres and reducing business house hours this week.According to an official statement, in a meeting with chief minister Thackeray and Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope last Monday, members of the state Covid-19 task force had recommended strict measures, including a 'limited-period lockdown', to counter the alarming surge in infections and deaths.India saw 81,466 new coronavirus infections being reported in a span of 24 hours, the highest single-day rise in six months, taking the COVID-19 tally of cases to 1,23,03,131, according to the Union Health Ministry data updated on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-cm-uddhav-thackeray-to-chair-high-level-meet-over-covid-19-situation-101617339835649.html

The visa ban, which was imposed by former US president Donald Trump last June, was centred on the H1-B visas and also affected the L-1 visa program, seasonal workers in the hospitality industry and students on work-study programs. The H-1B visa, which is a non-immigrant visa, allows US companies to employ foreign workers in speciality occupations that require theoretical or technical expertise. Nearly 70 per cent of the 85,000 H-1B visas issued every year are used by Indian professionals.Why did Trump administration impose the ban?The ban was imposed by the Trump administration in June 2020 with the aim to prevent temporary workers across industries from entering the country and was later extended till March 31, 2021, citing the coronavirus pandemic. While the H1-B and other work visas have been criticised for allowing cheap labour in the US against the local workforce of the country, the visas have been useful to the country as a way of getting skilled and trained workers. Owing to this, tech industry leaders like Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Tesla CEO Elon Musk criticised Trump’s move. “Immigration has contributed immensely to America’s economic success, making it a global leader in tech, and also Google the company it is today. Disappointed by today’s proclamation – we’ll continue to stand with immigrants and work to expand opportunity for all,” Pichai said in a tweet.Read more: Inordinate delay in processing of H-4 work authorisation, say spouses of H-1B visa holdersWhat has the Biden administration done?As US President Joe Biden promised during the run-up to the 2021 elections, the administration allowed the Trump-era proclamation to expire. “Visa applicants who have not yet been interviewed or scheduled for an interview will have their applications prioritised and processed in accordance with existing phased resumption of visa services guidance,” the US state department said in a statement on their website.“Visa applicants who were previously refused visas due to the restrictions of Presidential Proclamation 10052 may reapply by submitting a new application including a new fee,” it added.How will the move help the Indians IT professionals?The move is expected to help Indians as the major share of the H1-B visas are used by Indian professionals. The H1-B visas, which are approved for a period of three years, are a hiring pool for IT companies as it helps the companies keep their expenses in check. With the expiration of the order, those who were impacted by the travel ban will now be able to resume work in the US. The order will also allow US diplomatic missions, which are present in different countries, to issue fresh worker visas. It will thereby give permission to US-based IT companies to begin hiring foreign workers again.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/how-will-indian-it-professionals-benefit-as-biden-lets-h1-b-visa-ban-expire-101617331887012.html

For the next 4-5 days, we expect very dry conditions over the entire northwest India. The relative humidity was 32% in the morning which had dropped to 10 to 15% in the afternoon. Whatever moisture was there is evaporating,” said Kuldeep Shrivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre.“In January and February, there were two Western Disturbances. In March, there were 4-5 Western Disturbances but most of them brought rain to the western Himalayas so the plains are very dry. When strong, warm and dry winds are blowing they can cause dehydration to people outdoors during afternoon hours. This is called loo, it’s normally felt in May. Those stepping out should remain hydrated or avoid stepping out during afternoon,” he added.Also Read | ‘It’s April, but feels like May-June’: Heatwave grips north IndiaA Western Disturbance is expected to affect the western Himalayan region around April 4 but its impact is likely to be limited to the region. “From April 6, humidity may go up marginally after the Western Disturbance moves away,” said Shrivastava. IMD Pune’s Standard Precipitation Index (SPI) for March 2021 suggests almost the entire northwest India and Indo-Gangetic Plains region is mildly to moderately dry. SPI is an index used for drought monitoring and is negative for drought, and positive for wet conditions. Most parts of the northeast and peninsular India are also dry with some pockets severely and extremely dry indicating drought like conditions. East Rajasthan and most parts of central India are mildly wet.When the June 2020 to March 2021 period is considered, several districts in the Indo-Gangetic Plains region and northeast India are extremely dry.The Haryana, Chandigarh and Delhi region has a rain deficiency of 64% during March.No heatwave is likely over most parts of northwest and Central India during the next 2-3 days. Strong surface winds (speed reaching 30-40 kmph) are very likely over most parts of Punjab, north Rajasthan, Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi, West Uttar Pradesh and northwest Madhya Pradesh during the next 24 hours, according to IMD’s Thursday bulletin.“Though March is dry across a very large region, climate models are showing good rainfall activity in April, May and June. But extreme north India and northeast India are likely to remain dry. We do not issue any official forecast for this period. We are likely to transition from La Nina to ENSO neutral conditions in coming months.

The Covid-19 toll in the state also rose to 4,204 with 34 deaths reported on Thursday. “The information has been received that several employees of Mantralaya (secretariat) and offices of Head of Departments (HoDs) have contracted the Covid-19 infection. In view of this, these offices will function with 50% of their employee strength,” stated the order issued by DD Singh, secretary of the General Administration department.As per the order, 50% of the staff will attend office while the rest will work from home following a weekly roster. The distribution has to be done in a manner that it doesn’t affect work, an official stated. The order further stated that vaccination against coronavirus was mandatory for government employees aged above 45 and temporary vaccination centres were being set up at Mahanadi (secretariat building) and Indravati (directorate building) buildings for their ease. Chief minister Bhupesh Baghel said he has asked district collectors to use discretion to decide if fresh lockdown was needed in areas under their jurisdiction, an official statement said on Thursday. 57 Covid patients were discharged from hospitals and 950 patients completed home isolation on Thursday after recovering from the disease, taking the number of recoveries in the state to 320,613. The number of active cases in Chhattisgarh now stands at 28,987, the CM said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chhattisgarh-orders-50-strength-in-govt-offices-as-covid-19-hits-new-daily-peak-101617331202118.html
02-04-2021||India||'Argyreia sharadchandrajii': New plant species named after Sharad Pawar||A new species of flowering plants, recently discovered in south Maharashtra's Kolhapur district, has been named after Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar as "his immense contribution to Indian agriculture" as a Union minister, a report has said. Researchers Dr Pramod R Lawand and Dr Vinod B Shimpale told news agency PTI that the species, belonging to the genus Argyreia, has been named 'Argyreia sharadchandrajii'. The new species was found in the Alamprabhu Dev-raai (sacred grove), said Lawand and Shimpale, who teach botany at a college in Kolhapur.Their research paper ‘Argyreia sharadchandrajii (Convolvulaceae): A new species from the Western Ghats, India' was recently published in the Journal of the Indian Association for Angiosperm Taxonomy.Shimpale said around 40 sub-species of the Argyreia genus are found in India. "These species are found in only Asiatic countries. Of 40, 17 are endemic to India and now we have discovered an 18th one in the Alamprabhu Sacred Grove in Ramling hills," he said, according to PTI.The plant flowers between July and September and the fruiting period lasts till December. "It grows in open habitats and trails on grassland but remains rooted near other shrubs," Shimpale said.Shimpale said a few years ago Pawar helped him financially for publishing his research on the flora in Baramati—the NCP chief's political bastion—in the form of a book when he was asked why the plant was after the veteran leader. Shimpale added that another reason for naming the plant after Pawar was "his immense contribution to Indian agriculture" as a Union minister.Kolhapur district is in the Western Ghats ecological zone, which is known for its rich biodiversity.(With PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/argyreia-sharadchandrajii-new-plant-species-named-after-sharad-pawar-101617328881430.html

02-04-2021||India||Pakistan seeks 'guarantees' on J&K for better ties||Constitutional guarantees on not changing the demography of Jammu & Kashmir would go a long way in creating an “enabling environment”, Pakistan has conveyed to India, highly placed government officials told HT.The thaw in the India-Pakistan relationship that started with the restoration of the 2003 ceasefire along the Line of Control (LoC) in February, through a statement by the Director Generals of Military Operations, has led to a series of moves, including Pakistan on Wednesday signalling a limited resumption of trade through the import of cotton and sugar before back-tracking on Thursday.Also Read | Pakistan does U-turn on resuming trade ties with IndiaPrime Ministers Narendra Modi and Imran Khan, too, have written to each other, with Khan saying that an “enabling environment” was imperative for a constructive and result-oriented dialogue in response to Modi’s letter which stressed the importance of “an environment of trust” that is “devoid of terror and hostility”.The thaw comes after a considerable deterioration in ties that followed New Delhi’s decision to do away with the special status granted to J&K under Article 370. In August 2019, the Centre simultaneously did away with 35A, a special provision that disallowed outsiders from buying land and property, and also divided the state into two Union territories.“We have pointed to Article 371 which provides special protection to several states in the North-east,” said a senior Pakistani official familiar with the back channel talks, who did not want to be identified. Talks are purportedly on between the National Security Advisers of India and Pakistan, though Moeed Yusuf, special representative to Khan on security, has denied the talks.Indian officials in the ministries of home and external affairs, when contacted, said they were not aware of the back-channel dialogue or if there was even such a dialogue.One official, however, pointed out that the summer months are crucial, and they are looking to see if the ceasefire holds and the infiltration numbers come down. The U-turn on resuming limited trade, though, was indicative of the slippery road ahead.For any forward movement, that could take the shape of a dialogue, India will be looking at the “terror index”, to gauge Pakistan’s sincerity in normalising ties and moving from military defence to economic security, as articulated by Pakistan’s army chief, General Qamar Javed Bajwa.Another Pakistani official, while reiterating that the application of Article 371 to Jammu & Kashmir would “go a long way” in creating an enabling environment, said, “If the North-east can have constitutional guarantees, why not J&K? We have a domestic audience to take care of as well.”In his letter to Modi, Khan said that durable peace and stability was contingent on resolving all issues between the two countries, “in particular, the Jammu & Kashmir dispute.”Most of the provisions under Article 371 — meant to protect tribal communities and cultures in the North-east — enable de-centralised governance with a degree of administrative autonomy. Importantly, the provisions restrict land transfer to those defined as outsiders to the state concerned. They primarily affect Mizoram, Nagaland and parts of Manipur, Assam and Meghalaya. As one official quoted above pointed out, “Under Article 371, the Constitution provides special provisions for the hill states with domicile rights, similar to what Jammu & Kashmir had under Article 35A.”In August 2019, when J&K’s special status was nullified, home minister Amit Shah had assured Parliament that no changes were planned vis a vis the North-east under Article 371.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pakistan-seeks-gurantees-on-j-k-for-better-ties-101617317032539.html

02-04-2021||India||After Make in India, Atmanirbhar Bharat challenge to trade ties: US||The Biden administration on Wednesday listed India’s ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’ or self-sufficiency campaign, which was launched to help the country deal with the Covid-19 pandemic, among “significant” trade barriers American businesses face around the world.Last month, the US Trade Representative (USTR)’s office had cited the “Make in India” programme as an impediment for import of its products into India.“US exporters continue to encounter significant tariff and non-tariff barriers that impede imports of US products into India. While the Indian Government has pursued ongoing economic reform efforts, it also continues to promote programs such as ‘Make in India’ that favour domestic production over importation,” the office of USTR said in its National Trade Estimate Report for 2021.“Additionally in May 2020, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the ‘Self-Reliant India’ (Atmanirbhar Bharat) initiative to increase self-sufficiency by promoting domestic industry and reducing reliance on foreign suppliers,” the report said, adding the ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’ initiative to US’ growing list of trade issues with India.While it was launched to bolster India’s efforts to deal with the economic crisis wrecked by the Covid-19 pandemic, the ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’ plan soon came to be seen as a potent weapon against the Chinese after the skirmishes along the Line of Actual Control in Ladakh last year. The boycott of Chinese goods and apps had also found resonance here with the administration of former president Donald Trump.In 2020, India was America’s largest trading partner.The trade representative’s report mentioned in detail US’s trade issues with India, including those that have defied resolution for years such as high tariffs, US’ access to India’s dairy market which is said to be one of the largest in the world, price control on medical devices such as heart stents and knee implant. The USTR report came on a day President Joe Biden announced a multi-trillion-dollar American Jobs Plan to revitalize the country’s economy.Government officials in New Delhi were not immediately available for a comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-make-in-india-atmanirbhar-bharat-challenge-to-trade-ties-us-101617306655895.html
02-04-2021||India||In IIM Ahmedabad, Covid-19 cases touch 100 as Gujarat battles outbreak||Nearly 96 people, including faculty members and students, have tested positive for Covid-19 at the Indian Institute of Management-Ahmedabad between March 12 to March 31, as the second wave of the virus has been averaging more than 2,000 people being infected in Gujarat each day during the last four days.The state has reported more than 3 lakh cases so far with over 4,500 deaths. On Thursday evening, Gujarat reported a high of 2,410 cases, continuing the average of more than 2,200 cases, and nine deaths.Ahmedabad surpassed Surat with 613 cases, while Surat reported 464 cases during the last 24 hours. Vadodara followed with 292 cases and Rajkot with 179. Gujarat has 12,996 active cases.Dr Bharat Gadhvi, president of Ahmedabad Private Hospitals and Nursing Homes Association, told Hindustan Times, “Over 55% of the 3,000 beds in designated Covid-19 hospitals in Ahmedabad are occupied.” He informed that, “Most cases are mild to moderate, though the spread is more intense than earlier.”According to official data released by the IIM-A, RTPCR tests were conducted on 116 people during the two Holi days of whom 16 were found to be infected by the coronavirus. Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation’s North-West Zone Health Officer Dr Mehul Acharya informed that as on March 31, 2021, as many as 96 people tested positive for the virus at the IIM-A during the last 15 days.The data on the IIM-A dashboard states that between September 1, 2020, to March 27, 2021, there were 190 Covid-19 cases, 85 among them were students, four professors, 14 on-campus and 27 off-campus staff and 19 contractual employees. As many as 43 students have been quarantined.Outgoing president of the Gujarat chapter of Indian Medical Association Dr Chandresh Jardosh told Hindustan Times that, “Unlike in the past, this wave is more intense and the spread is faster, though the mortality rate is much lower.”He attributes the second wave in Gujarat to the recent elections where the political campaign “ignored all Covid-19 norms, while the people’s behaviour has also been as though the virus had gone. The people and the politicians are collectively responsible.”Dr Jardosh wondered that, “As many as 40% of our vaccines were exported while countries like the US and UK have not sent out a single dose. The so-called vaccine diplomacy is hurting our own people.” He is of the view that there is a need for mass vaccination, instead of in instalments “and there should be mass production. Everyone over 18 years of age should be vaccinated.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-iim-ahmedabad-covid-19-cases-touch-100-as-gujarat-battles-outbreak-101617305624254.html
02-04-2021||India||Prasar Bharati looks at BBC model for makeover||Based on a benchmarking exercise that compared it with the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), Prasar Bharati has concluded that it needs to sharply reorient itself, reducing technical staff, and adding content muscle, people familiar with the matter said on condition of anonymity, talking about the restructuring plan of the public broadcaster that runs both Doordarshan and All India Radio.The plan, which has been in the works for three years, is presently under consideration.The present process for change was initiated in 2018, when Prasar Bharati began a manpower audit. The audit was outsourced to Ernst and Young, which suggested alterations. The findings were completed in February. They show that nearly half the organisation’s 25,000 employees are employed in the engineering division, whereas the corresponding strength for BBC is at a little over 10%. The content team at Prasar Bharti comprises less than 20% of the workforce, while BBC’s content team accounts for 70%. Manpower costs account for over 60% of Prasar Bharati’s expenses, and just around 30% of BBC’s. To be sure, BBC earns significant revenue each year from licensing -- all TV owners pay a license fee every year that funds the organisation.Prasar Bharati also plans to organically downsize, with nearly half of its employees retiring in the next five years. Less than 10% of the service’s employees are between the age of 31-40, less than 5% between 20-30, while over 60% are over 50.The service may also introduce a voluntary retirement scheme, on the same model as the one currently working in Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL), HT learns. The VRS scheme will provide appropriate compensation to employees over the age of 50 that choose to retire. It is also considering a category of contractual employees. The VRS could reduce the organisation’s annual cash outflow by over ₹2,000 crore, according to the plan.The Ministry of Information and Broadcasting declined to comment on the matter.“The manpower audit is a long pending exercise... It is to look at how we can transform public broadcasting on various fronts. We are consulting several stakeholders,” said Prasar Bharati CEO Shashi Shekhar Vempati.Prasar Bharati has already introduced changes to increase efficiency in broadcasting, such as cloud-based broadcasts and remote monitoring. In terms of operations, it has also shifted to digital platforms.Changes to the Parliamentary Act, under which the body has been created, are also being considered, the people said. “There are organisational issues,” one of the people cited above said. “There, of course, is a public mandate. But at the same time, there have to be commercial expectations as well. There is a low viewership and that can only change if the content side is revamped.”This person added that better asset utilisation remains a priority. “Earlier, Prasar Bharati needed a stronger engineering department. But now it has to focus more on content.”Former I&B minister Manish Tewari said that the fundamental thing that needs to be determined is whether India requires a public broadcaster. “The Prasar Bharati Act was brought into existence in 1990, but was implemented, that too partially, only in 1997. The Act came into existence in the backdrop of the government having monopoly over Doordarshan and AIR.Prasar Bharati does not enjoy the same kind of autonomy that BBC does. So long as its funds are released by the I&B ministry, it can’t. What the government needs to do is set up a committee of experts familiar with the functioning of Prasar Bharati instead of looking at piecemeal solutions,” he said.Former Editor of the media site The Hoot, Sevanti Ninan said Prasar Bharati has traditionally been a terrestrial broadcaster, which is why engineers were needed to maintain a countrywide network of terrestrial towers. “The whole engineering network has now become largely redundant,” she said. She added that the public broadcaster is not known for the quality of its content. “It’s never gone past being a government broadcaster,” Ninan said. Prasar Bharati CEO Vempati said, “What we are aspiring to create is public broadcaster of the future... we want to transform the broadcaster on both, the content and technological front.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/prasar-bharati-looks-at-bbc-model-for-makeover-101617304336858.html
02-04-2021||India||Met department predicts heatwave over Andhra Pradesh, Telangana for 3 days||Hyderabad Andhra Pradesh and Telangana will experience heatwave conditions in several parts in the next three days with day temperatures being two to three degrees Celsius above normal, the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) has predicted. According to K Nagarathna, director of IMD, Hyderabad, a dry weather is expected in most parts of the state till due to the presence of northerly winds over Telangana. Intense heat wave conditions are expected in northern, north-eastern and eastern parts of the state.“In the first two days, the temperatures would remain two to three degrees above normal in southern Telangana and three to four degrees above normal in the northern part,” Nagarathna said. The maximum temperature in the last 24 hours till 8 am on Thursday stood at 42.4 degrees Celsius at Bhadrachalam while Suryapet and Nalgona registered 42 degrees Celsius. Other parts of the state like Adilabad, Asifabad, Nizamabad, Warangal, Peddapalli and Karimnagar recorded average temperatures between 39 to 40 degrees Celsius. In Hyderabad, the maximum temperature recorded in the last 24 hours was 40.2 degrees Celsius. Temperatures are likely to rise to 43 degrees Celsius in April and may touch 45 degrees Celsius in May, the weather body predicted. According to IMD officials, the next one week could see maximum temperatures hovering around 40 to 41 degrees Celsius while the minimum temperature could further rise to around 25 to 26 degrees Celsius. In neighbouring Andhra Pradesh, severe heatwave conditions were witnessed in Bapatla in Guntur district and Tungi in East Godavari district in the last 24 hours. Similar conditions were also reported from Ongole, Nellore and Vijayawada. Maximum temperature of 43 degrees Celsius was recorded at Vijayawada in the last 24 hours. On Thursday, too, the temperature touched 42.8 degrees Celsius followed by 42.2 degrees Celsius in Tirupati and Nellore. Several other parts of the state like Kurnool, Guntu, Anantapur and Ongole also recorded temperatures ranging from 40 degrees to 41 degrees Celsius.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/met-department-predicts-heatwave-over-andhra-pradesh-telangana-for-3-days-101617304079212.html

The committee took this decision on Thursday. The lockdown was imposed on Saturday and Sunday in Ratlam, Khargone and Betul while in Chhindwara, it will start from Thursday night and will continue till Monday 6 am.Earlier, the state government had imposed Sunday Lockdown in 12 districts including these four amid a spike in Covid-19 cases. Chhindwara collector Saurabh Suman said, “The decision has been taken as the district is located on the border of Maharashtra and a large number of people are coming from the neighbouring state for celebration Rang Pachami.” In Madhya Pradesh, 2546 positive cases were reported on Thursday, which is the highest since September 2020. There are 18,057 active cases in the state. The positivity rate has risen to 9.9%. Medical education department minister Vishwas Sarang said, “In all 15,482 beds have been increased for Covid-19 patients in MP. The strict checking of masks and social distancing is being done. As the government is not in favour of complete lockdown so people are being made aware to follow Covid 19 protocols.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2-days-of-lockdown-imposed-in-3-mp-districts-amid-covid-19-surge-101617303540409.html
02-04-2021||India||Big spike in Delhi, grim milestone for Mumbai||With 8,646 fresh cases of the coronavirus disease, Mumbai on Thursday set a new all-time record of daily infections in any city in the country, even as Delhi witnessed yet another massive single-day spike with 2,790 new cases, a 114-day high for the Capital.On Thursday, there were 81,413 new infections reported across India, the highest single-day increase since October 1, 2020, as the second wave of Covid-19 continued to push cases to levels not seen in the country in at least six months. India’s highest single-day caseload was 99,181 on September 10, according to the HT dashboard.The phenomenon of massive infection surges in a string of urban centres across the country in the past few days is reminiscent of how massive pockets of infection hotbeds emerged in several metropolitan cities during India’s first Covid-19 wave from July to September last year.Click here for complete Covid-19 coverageThe second wave of the outbreak is dangerously expanding its footprint throughout the country at a time when the vaccination drive has finally started gathering momentum – India on Thursday opened its Covid-19 vaccination programme to everyone over the age of 45 years.Experts and government officials alike have repeatedly stressed that a massive and widespread inoculation drive is the best, and perhaps the only chance the country has to turn the tide against the building second wave of infections, which is particularly dangerous because of the threat of new variants.At the same time, experts have called for more curbs on gatherings, functions, marketplaces, and public congregations.Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal has called for an urgent meeting to review the city’s Covid-19 situation on Friday. The action plan to be discussed in Friday’s meeting will include issues such as containment zones, the vaccination drive, availability of hospital beds, and enforcement against violators of Covid-appropriate behaviour. Imposing restrictions on public gatherings and public places in the city will also be discussed, officials familiar with the matter said on condition of anonymity.Pushed by Mumbai’s massive Thursday surge, Maharashtra’s tally for the day touched 43,183 – yet again breaking all previous records for single-day infections. The state, which has been by far India’s worst-hit, has been forced to impose a series of curbs on social movement in order to quell the worst spell of the outbreak. Starting Sunday, the Maharashtra government imposed a night curfew, and has banned all gatherings of more than five people in any public place across the state. It is also said to be considering the closure of malls and gyms.India’s second Covid wave started towards the second half of February with an uptick of infections in Maharashtra. The current case trajectory in the western state has long surpassed the peak that it saw during the first wave in the middle of September — the seven-day average of daily infections in the past week in the state is 36,476, against the first wave-peak of 22,149. It is likely that the surge is being powered by what scientists called VOCs or variants of concern, mutant versions of the coronavirus that are more infectious.Two other states – Gujarat and Punjab – have also seen their case trajectory surpass all previous records in the last two weeks. Meanwhile, case trajectories in another three regions – Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Chandigarh – are fast closing the gap on their first peak highs.Mumbai’s Thursday surge of 8,646 new infections breaks the previous national record of 8,593 daily infections for a city set by Delhi on November 11, 2020. At the time, Delhi was going through its third wave of infections. Over the past week, however, the Capital has seen the start of its fourth wave of infections – the only region in the country to have seen as many distinct waves, although at least one of them is likely to have been the result of a faulty testing strategy that artificially lowered the number of cases.Surges in Delhi and Mumbai, however, are not isolated instances. Many other densely populated metropolitan cities such as Pune, Bengaluru and Chennai are also currently seeing a strong rise in daily infections. There were 4,200 new cases in Pune on Thursday, while Bengaluru saw 2,906 new infections and Chennai 1,035. Pune, much like Mumbai, is currently in the midst of its worst-ever case surge – the city set a new record of daily infections (4,625) just this Sunday.During the Union health ministry’s weekly Covid-19 briefing on Tuesday, senior officials had warned states that the situation is going from “bad to worse” every passing day. “In some states in particular, there is a huge cause for worry, so no state, no part of our country, no district should be complacent,” NITI Aayog member (health) Dr VK Paul said.In a letter to states on Tuesday, Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan wrote: “…the current rise in cases is of concern and has the potential of overwhelming health care systems, unless checked right now.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/big-spike-in-delhi-grim-milestone-for-mumbai-101617303312030.html

If the alleged victim is a minor, a woman, a Dalit or tribal, the punishment ranges from four to seven years in jail and a fine of not less than ₹3 lakh. In case there is an organisation involved, the person heading the same could face imprisonment from three to 10 years and a fine of up to ₹5 lakh.Moving the bill in the assembly, state home minister Pradipsinh Jadeja said, “We are going to make amendments to Gujarat Freedom of Religion Act, 2003... we are going to present a law before the state Assembly, that will stop people from luring Hindu girls into marriage with the intention of religious conversion.”Protesting against the move, Congress legislator from Ahmedabad Imran Khedawala tore a copy of the Bill in the House. “Pradeepsinh Jadeja has only mentioned that the daughters of the Hindu community are targeted by men from a specific community. Daughters, be it from any religious community, will always be our daughters. I too have over hundred testimonies of Muslim girls marrying into other religion. I am deeply hurt by the words of the minister. Nobody can force anybody to marry into a specific religion and in no religion, it is written to forcibly convert anyone. In this Bill, only one community is specifically targeted... I oppose this bill...,” he said.In February this year, the Uttar Pradesh Assembly passed the Prohibition of Unlawful Religious Conversion Bill, 2021 by a voice vote. In March, the Madhya Pradesh legislative assembly passed the MP Freedom of Religion Bill 2020 to prohibit forcible religious conversion by way of allurement, fraud, threat or marriage. Haryana and Karnataka too, both ruled by the BJP, are said to be considering a similar law.While state governments claimed to have amended the laws to curb cases of “love jihad”, where Muslim men allegedly lure and marry women from other religions (mostly Hinduism, although the first allegations of love jihad were made by the Church in Kerala), with the ultimate objective of converting them, the Union home minister, in a reply in Parliament on February 4 last year, clarified that the term ‘love jihad’ was not defined under existing laws and no such case had been reported then.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gujarat-passes-bill-against-love-jihad-101617303478618.html
02-04-2021||India||Hiran murder: NIA seizes another car||National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Thursday seized another car in connection with the murder of 48-year-old Thane auto parts dealer Mansukh Hiran, said officials. The agency suspects that the Audi, seized from Vasai, could be the vehicle in which Hiran was smothered. NIA sources said the Audi was taken to south Mumbai, where forensic experts thoroughly examined it on Thursday for possible biological and other traces.Hiran was linked to the explosives-laden Scorpio found abandoned near industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s residence Antilia in south Mumbai on February 25. He had gone missing late in the evening on March 4 and his body was recovered from a creek at Reti Bunder near Mumbra the next day.According to police, six handkerchiefs were found stuffed in his mouth while his face was covered by a scarf. All his belongings were missing.The Maharashtra anti-terrorism squad (ATS), which was earlier probing the case, had arrested former constable Vinayak Shinde and cricket bookie Naresh Gor in connection with the murder. ATS suspected that suspended Mumbai Police officer Sachin Vaze — who has been arrested by NIA for his alleged role in the Antilia security scare case — is also the prime accused in Hiran’s murder case, while Shinde allegedly helped him execute the murder, and Gor arranged for some SIM cards used in the commission of the crime from Gujarat.Meanwhile, NIA on Thursday raided a club in Girgaum, whose owner had allegedly introduced Vaze and Shinde to Gor, said an agency official. An NIA team conducted a search for three hours and recorded the statements of the owner, manager and staff, the official added.Both ATS and NIA officials believe that Mansukh was smothered in a vehicle at Gaimukh, along Ghodbunder Road in Thane.According to ATS, its initial probe had revealed that Hiran received a call around 8.29 pm on March 4, and the caller spoke to him for around 11 minutes and asked him to meet near Majiwada junction on Ghodbunder Road.According to an ATS officer, the trader was made to sit in a four-wheeler at Majiwada junction, taken 10 km away to Gaimukh breach front, and smothered in the vehicle at the spot. Later, the body was dumped in the creek at Reti Bunder, NIA officials suspected.The agency is also trying to trace the Maruti Eeco, allegedly stolen from Aurangabad in November 2020, whose original number plates were found during a search conducted by NIA in Mithi river on March 28.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hiran-murder-nia-seizes-another-car-101617303418565.html
02-04-2021||India||After Karnataka minister’s letter, congress mounts attack on BS Yediyurappa||Leader of Opposition Siddaramaiah on Thursday urged the Karnataka governor to immediately remove B S Yediyurappa and recommend President’s rule in the state, a day after rural development and Panchayat Raj minister K S Eshwarappa accused the chief minister of running an authoritarian government.“The governor must immediately intervene, remove the chief minister and recommend for President’s rule,” Siddaramaiah said in a statement.In a strongly-worded letter to governor Vajubai Vala on Wednesday, Eshwarappa had said that the chief minister had indiscriminately sanctioned funds to various MLAs and other persons in violation of rules.In his statement on Thursday, Siddaramaiah said that Eshwarappa, who belongs to Yediyurappa’s home district of Shivamogga, had provided evidence of corruption and his allegations had shown a collapse of the administration.“Eshwarappa has provided evidence for the allegations of corruption, nepotism and illegalities against the BJP that I have been making as the leader of opposition. He should not bow down to any pressure and stick to his statement,” the former chief minister said.The Congress leader also referred to the Karnataka high court’s Wednesday order, allowing a probe against the chief minister in a 2019 corruption case wherein he allegedly tried to lure a JD(S) MLA to the BJP by offering him money.Yediyurappa is alleged to have lured opposition legislators, in an exercise termed ‘Operation Kamala’, with the promise of giving them plum portfolios and other monetary rewards.At least 17 legislators from the JD(S) - Congress coalition had defected and helped Yediyurappa to power after weeks and months of high drama in the southern state.“This proves our allegation that the BJP government in the state is an illicit child from an immoral act called ‘Operation Kamala’,” Siddaramaiah said.The developments come at a time when Yediyurappa already finds himself in a corner over the recent sexual harassment case involving former minister Ramesh Jarkiholi, non-performance of his two-year-old government, cash crunch and growing calls for his removal among other problems.The three bypolls on April 17 have presented the 78-year-old with an opportunity to silence growing dissent and consolidate his position for the remainder of the two years in power.However, at least four Cabinet ministers extended their support to the chief minister on Thursday.“The chief minister has allocated RDPR funds to the MLAs and it is an administrative issue. Since Eshwarappa heads the department and is unhappy over this, it has to be resolved among ourselves,” Karnataka home, law and parliamentary affairs minister Basavaraj Bommai said.Another minister claimed the matter could have been resolved through discussion. “If he (Eshwarappa) had any problems with the decisions taken by the chief minister… I think it could have been resolved within five minutes through a discussion. This situation has caused some sort of embarrassment to the government and the party,” state health & family welfare and medical education minister K Sudhakar said.Political analysts believe that the inaction against BJP MLA Basanagouda Patil (Yatnal), who had earlier sought the removal of the chief minister, and Eshwarappa’s letter were an indication of how the central leadership of the party allowed these attacks against Yediyurappa.“We do not know if there is Centre’s sanction but there are some invisible hands operating. Yatnal and Eshwarappa are only mouths and the hands operating them are unseen,” A Narayana, political analyst and faculty at the Azim Premji University, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-karnataka-minister-s-letter-cong-mounts-attack-on-bsy-101617303359172.html
02-04-2021||India||Military to get new logistics node in Mumbai||The Indian military on Thursday operationalised a new joint logistics node (JLN) in Mumbai to provide integrated logistics support to the three services in a move that will bolster jointness as well as help cut costs and better utilise manpower, the defence ministry said.This is the third JLN to be set up in three months, with the aim of integrating the military’s logistics set-up and improving its war-fighting ability. Logistics nodes were operationalised in Guwahati and Port Blair on January 1, 2021. The government’s sanction letter for setting up these nodes came on October 12, 2020.Chief of defence staff (CDS) General Bipin Rawat, who inaugurated the Mumbai JLN via a video link on Thursday, said: “Establishment and operationalisation of JLNs is a very important first step in the direction of logistics integration of our three services. Acceptance of each other’s limitations and learning from each other’s strengths and best practices is essential to help improve the functioning and efficacy of these nodes.”The Joint Operations Division (JOD) under the Headquarters Integrated Defence Staff pursued and enabled the establishment of the JLNs.“All future wars will be conducted by tri-service in an integrated manner. To enable our armed forces to conduct successful operations, it is essential that they be provided with sound logistics support during all stages of war,” the ministry said in a statement.“This is the precursor to the joint logistics command which is being planned and is imperative for the optimisation of the combat potential of integrated theatres,” said Lieutenant General Vinod Bhatia (retd), a former director general of military operations.India is set to begin a formal roll-out of its long-awaited theaterisation plan to best utilise its military’s resources amid growing security threats, with the Air Defence Command and the Maritime Theatre Command set to be launched by May.India is expected to have three other integrated commands -- to secure its western, northern and eastern fronts -- expected to be rolled out by December 2022. In addition, a logistics command is in the works to avoid duplication of efforts and resources. The CDS’s mandate includes bringing about jointness in operations, logistics, transport, training, support services and repairs and maintenance of the three services.The JLNs will provide integrated logistics cover to the armed forces for their small arms ammunition, rations, fuel, general stores, civil hired transport, aviation clothing and spares, and also provide engineering support in an effort to synergise their operational efforts, the ministry said.“This initiative will accrue advantages in terms of saving of manpower, economise utilisation of resources, besides financial savings,” the statement said, adding that more such nodes would be launched across the country.Rawat emphasised the need to work towards greater logistics integration with national logistics to benefit from the infrastructural and logistics improvements taking place at the national level. “Through this, we will bring to bear the actual ‘Whole of the Nation’ effort on our adversaries,” he said.The government expects Rawat, who took charge as India’s first CDS on January 1, 2020, to bring about jointness among the three services in a three-year time frame (by January 2023). One of the means to achieve jointness is the setting up of integrated theatre commands for the best use of military resources to fight future battles.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/army-gets-tri-services-logistics-node-in-mumbai-101617303298557.html
02-04-2021||India||CBI to review performance of investigators each month||New Delhi: The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has decided to review the performance of its Investigating Officers (IOs) on a monthly basis, a move aimed at increasing the efficiency of the agency, which has a pendency of at least 700 cases older than a year (according to the latest available data), officials familiar with the matter said on condition of anonymity. Currently, reviews are conducted every quarter. As part of monthly review exercise, the work of IOs will be rated on the basis of number of charge sheets filed, number of source information reports (SIRs) generated, number of case diaries completed, and whether all processes as mentioned in the CBI Crime Manual l(photographing/video graphing of crime scene, search proceedings, recording of statements etc) were followed. The review will also record whether formalities such as seeking prosecution sanction, expert opinions and proper marking of evidence is being done, the people cited above added. Another important objective of the monthly performance review is to prevent corruption and opportunities for corruption the people said. In January, four agency officers including two Deputy Superintendents were arrested for weakening the agency’s investigation in bank fraud cases in lieu of huge bribes. The current quarterly reviews are carried out in all CBI branches and reviewed by the head of branches/zones. The decision to institute a a monthly review has been taken by Interim CBI Director Praveen Sinha, who, according to one of the officers cited above, felt the pendency in CBI needs to be brought down. To be sure, the monthly review is separate from ACRs (annual confidential reports) prepared annually for all government employees. According to the Central Vigilance Commission’s (CVC’s) annual report 2019, investigation was pending in 744 CBI cases for at least a year at the end of December 2019 out of which 678 were related to Prevention of Corruption (PC) Act. About 25 corruption cases have been pending for at least five years. Overall, a total of 1,239 investigations and enquiries were pending with CBI till December 2019. In its updated Crime Manual in December 2020, CBI stated that investigations in a majority of corruption cases will be completed within nine months. The manual stated that the existing one-year deadline in corruption cases will apply only in those cases where a high ranking government official such as a joint secretary or secretary is accused, and the probe is being supervised by an officer of additional director rank or above in CBI. The new CBI Crime Manual, updated after 15 years, was also largely prepared under the supervision of Sinha, when he was the additional director of the central agency. “He (Praveen Sinha) wants investigations to expedite by IOs thoroughly doing their work,” said a second officer. Former CBI Joint Director - N R Wassan said – “Earlier there used to be a bi-monthly review of every CBI branch but it was quite taxing. It has to be seen how so many IOs will be reviewed every month. If the SPs (Superintendents of Police) and DIGs (Deputy Inspector General’s) do the review properly, such reviews always help.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cbi-to-review-performance-of-investigators-each-month-101617303238608.html

02-04-2021||India||CBI takes over probe in Walayar minors’ sexual assault, death case||The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has registered two cases in the sexual assault and death of two minor Dalit girls in Walayar, Kerala, in 2017, officials familiar with the matter said, opening a new chapter in a case that horrified the state and which has, in recent months, hit the national headlines with the girls’ mother taking on sitting chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan, in his stronghold in the coming assembly elections as a sign of protest.CBI’s move came after the Kerala high court on March 19, ordered the central agency to take over the probe.The eldest of the siblings, aged 13, was found dead inside the family’s hut in Walayar in Palakkad district on January 13, 2017 ; her nine-year-old sister died on March 4 in the same manner. The parents alleged that the girls were murdered.Post-mortem examinations of the two girls revealed that they were subjected to sexual assault before their deaths.The mother of the two girls welcomed the CBI action. “Hope the agency will bring all culprits and those weakened the case to light,” she saidThe crime branch of the state police conducted an investigation and arrested four accused – Valya Madhu and Kutti Madhu, relatives of the mother of the minor girls, Shibu, a former co-worker of the parents, and Pradeep Kumar. A fifth accused in the case died by suicide last year.All the accused were acquitted by the special Pocso court in October 2019 on the grounds that the prosecution failed to prove the charges against them.Following protests over the acquittal, the state government on November 18, 2019 removed the public prosecutor in the case.The Kerala high court, while ordering retrial in January this year, observed that there was “miscarriage of justice”.A division bench, comprising Justices A Hariprasad and M R Anitha, allowed appeals filed by the state government and the mother of the minor girls. The bench also set aside the Pocso court order in the case.Observing that there were serious lapses in the investigation, the HC directed the accused to appear before the trial court on January 20. “We are fully convinced that the perfunctory initial investigation and cursory, desultory and unskilled prosecution coupled with the lack of involvement by the trial judge resulted in miscarriage of justice and the consequential unmerited acquittal,” the bench said.The judges observed that the trial had been “lowered to the level of mock trials”. They also allowed the prosecution to seek permission from the trial court for further probe into the matter.Reacting to the development Kerala law minister AK Balan said, “We have tried our best to help the mother. But some vested interests are using her to embarrass the government.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cbi-takes-over-probe-in-walayar-minors-sexual-assault-death-case-101617303118595.html

The court also asked UIDAI how it may have failed to protect details and particulars furnished in confidence by citizens.The bench of chief justice Sanjib Banerjee and justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy, in its interim orders, refused to accept the submission made by the BJP Puducherry unit that it obtained the mobile numbers through door-to-door campaigns over a period of time by party workers.“There is a credible allegation which has been squarely levelled that only mobile phones linked to Aadhaar have received the SMS messages. It is squarely for UIDAI to provide an adequate answer,” the court said.The court was hearing a petition filed by A Anand, president of the Puducherry unit of the Democratic Youth Foundation of India (DYFI), alleging that local BJP candidates obtained mobile phone numbers of voters linked to their Aadhaar numbers, were creating WhatsApp groups in their respective constituencies, and sending bulk SMS-es for targeted campaigning.The court, while passing its directions, observed that “apart from the unfair mileage that the political party may have gained in resorting to a form of campaigning without obtaining prior permission as required, there is the serious matter of the privacy of the citizens being breached”.It added: “This huge aspect of the matter should not be lost in the politics of the season or the hullabaloo of the attendant campaigning.”The court also said that the Election Commission of India (ECI) should continue its examination on whether the model code of conduct was breached by the state unit for the BJP. During the hearing, the court also noted that the BJP failed to obtain the necessary permission from the authorities to send bulk SMS-es.The court adjourned the matter for six weeks. Puducherry goes to the polls on April 6, and the results will be announced on May 2, along with Tamil Nadu, Kerala, West Bengal and Assam.Congress MLA from Manavel constituency RKR Anantharaman demanded that BJP candidates be disqualified. “They are not allowed to use government machinery for polls or propaganda so they must be disqualified... They have been continuously making calls and playing recorded voice messages to Aadhar-linked numbers. We have complained to the election body in Puducherry as well as the ECI but we are yet to receive a response,” he said.The BJP, however, refuted the allegations. “How can we get data from Aadhar? We are using data gathered by our booth-level party workers for the past several months,” said Nirmal Surana, BJP’s election in-charge in Puducherry.HT reached out to UIDAI officials but there we no immediate response.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/probe-if-bjp-used-aadhaar-data-for-polls-hc-to-uidai-101617303058588.html
02-04-2021||India||Clerics join hands to dispel fear, will urge followers to get shots||Cutting across ideological lines, Muslim clerics in Uttar Pradesh have come together to bust misinformation and myths surrounding the Covid-19 vaccination process and motivate people to opt for inoculation.The religious leaders have also decided to publicise a common message during the traditional Friday prayers that vaccination is the only way to fight the virus, which has claimed roughly 160,000 lives in India.“In Islam, nothing is bigger than saving us and the family from a disease. Hence it’s a humble appeal to our Muslim brethren not to fall prey to any myths about Covid vaccine and to come forward for the vaccination. This is the only way we can check the spread of virus,” said Maulana Khalid Rasheed Farangi Mahali, senior member of All-India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) and Imam of the Eidgah masjid in Lucknow.The Sunni cleric said he will make an announcement to motivate people for the vaccination during the ‘namaz’ on Friday and address ‘Khutba-e-Juma’ (a sermon by the cleric after Friday prayers) to make people understand the importance of vaccine.The crucial appeal comes at a time India is firmly under the grip of the second wave of the pandemic. Infections have spiked across the country with experts saying that picking up the pace of vaccination was the best way to counter the rampaging disease.On Thursday, India opened up its vaccination drive to all people above 45. The previous two phases of the drive –the first was aimed at frontline workers and the second at those above 60, or above 45 with comorbidities – were dogged by slow rollout, teething problems, vaccine hesitancy and misinformation. India is home to roughly 175 million Muslims, who form about 14% of the country’s population.The move to push for vaccination was endorsed by Shia leaders.Prominent Shia cleric Maulana Kalbe Jawad Naqvi termed vaccination a moral responsibility, saying all Muslims should get themselves inoculated. “I think this is the best possible way we can help the administration in containing the coronavirus. We should come forward for the vaccination,” said Jawad. He also said that he will be addressing all vaccine-related queries with the gathering during the Friday prayers at Asafi mosque, Bada Imambada in Lucknow.Shia cleric Maulana Yasoob Abbas, who is also general secretary of All India Shia Personal Law Board (AISPLB), said he launched a drive to motivate eligible people to come forward for vaccination. “It is our duty to get ourselves vaccinated. All Indians should get it done. I am creating awareness on the issue in all my religious meetings and making an appeal to the people to get themselves vaccinated,” he said.At the Islamic seminary Darul Uloom of Deoband, clerics advised people to shun misconceptions about the vaccine and said the jabs were a must to check the spread of infection. “Don’t buy any kind of misleading talk about the vaccine because vaccination is the only solution to get protection against Covid-19,” said Maulana Mufti Abul Kasum Nomani, mohtmim (vice-chancellor) of the famous seminary.Some Muslim religious leaders who took the shot said that they will offer their own example to prove to the people that vaccination was safe.Nomani, 74, and Maulana Abdul Khaliq Madrasi, 70, nayab mohatmim (deputy vice-chancellor) said both of them took the vaccine shots at a primary health centre in Deoband on March 15. “We are alright and appeal to the people to go for vaccination,” they said in a joint appeal.Another cleric, Maulana Badrul Hasan of Kandhla in Shamli district, admitted that there were some misconceptions among ordinary Muslim people about the Covid vaccine. He said the appeal of Darul Uloom will have a positive impact on people. “I also want to get vaccinated,” said Hasan, 51.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/clerics-join-hands-to-dispel-fear-will-urge-followers-to-get-shots-101617302400878.html
02-04-2021||India||Covid-19: ICMR study suggests new re-infection criteria||People with a second bout of Covid-19 should be considered cases of reinfection if their first bout was at least 102 days prior to their latest positive test result and they had at least one negative test in the period between, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) suggested after studying 1,300 people, 4.5% of whom appeared to have been infected by the virus twice.Published online by the Cambirdge Epidemiology and Infection journal as an accepted manuscript, the study is based on telephone interviews with people selected from ICMR’s laboratory database of at least 80 million individuals tested between January 22 and October 7, 2020. The government has been working on a definition for ‘reinfection’ of cases since October.The 4.5% who were found infected were people infected in the first wave. “This is an averaged out figure over a period of about eight months— January to October, 2020—, which will vary with behaviour and intensity of epidemic,” said Dr Balram Bhargava, director general, ICMR.According to the study, the authors said: “Taking available evidence into consideration, re-infection with Sars-CoV-2 in our study was defined as any individual who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 on two separate occasions by either molecular tests or rapid antigen test at an interval of at least 102 days with one negative molecular test in between. In this archive based, telephonic survey, 58 out of 1300 individuals (4.5%) fulfilled the above mentioned definition”.Interestingly, the study did not look at a genomic analysis of the first and second infections, the only sure way of proving a case of reinfection.The study, the authors added, was meant to “develop an epidemiological case definition of possible Sars-CoV-2 re-infection and assess its magnitude in India... The epidemiological case definition… was developed from literature review of data on viral kinetics… While Sars-CoV-2 re-infection is still a rare phenomenon, there is a need for epidemiological definition of re-infection for establishing surveillance systems and this study contributes to such goal..,” the paper said, adding that “obtaining genomic evidence is resource intensive and not always feasible”.The globally accepted benchmark for reinfection is less than 1%.The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention considers the duration of 90 days between two positive Sars-Cov-2 infections, along with genomic evidence of reinfection as an investigative criterion to understand the phenomenon of reinfection.To develop working epidemiological definition, ICMR researchers collated prospective cohort studies from across the globe for in-depth examination.“A meta-analysis of 43 investigations (including cohort studies and randomized controlled trials) probed into the dynamics of viral shedding and reported the mean duration of detection of SARS CoV-2 viral RNA from upper respiratory tract to be 17 days… with the maximum period of viral shedding being 83 days. Persistent RT-PCR positivity for Sars-CoV-2 RNA has been reported up to 104 days in a solitary case-report. Taking all these available data into consideration, reinfection with SARS CoV-2 in our study was defined…,” said the researchers in the paper.Among those eligible, 91,592 (13.2%) individuals were tested at a gap of 102 or more days, and therefore satisfied the criteria for being included in the investigation frame.Cases of reinfection may be rare but researchers warn against being lax with taking precautions.“Just because the percentage is small doesn’t mean one should go easy on taking preventive measures such as wearing a mask, maintaining physical distancing and hand hygiene, and as far as possible avoiding being part of mass gatherings,” said one of the study researchers who did not wish to be named.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/icmr-study-suggests-new-re-infection-criteria-101617302338577.html
02-04-2021||India||PM Modi targets Mamata at Bengal rally, Congress-AIUDF in Assam||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday addressed poll rallies in West Bengal and Assam, where the second phase of voting was held, hitting out at chief minister Mamata Banerjee for tagging Bharatiya Janata Party leaders “outsiders” in Bengal, and calling the Congress-led seven party mahajot (grand alliance) in Assam a “mahajhooth (grand lie)”.The PM urged the voters to reject both, asserting that only the BJP can bring development in the two states.Addressing a rally in Joynagar in South 24 Parganas district, which goes to polls in the third phase on April 6, the PM accused Banerjee of insulting the people of other states by calling BJP leaders “outsiders”.Click here for complete coverage on West Bengal assembly elections 2021“The way she is attacking the people of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, it raises questions on her political maturity. You have forgotten that as a CM you have taken oath of the Constitution. The Indian Constitution doesn’t allow you to insult the people of other states,” Modi said.Modi also took on the Trinamool Congress chief for writing letters to political leaders calling for a united front against the BJP. “After the first phase she [Banerjee] became ever more nervous. She is seeking help from many leaders, who according to her are outsiders and tourists and she couldn’t find time to meet them,” the PM said.Banerjee, on March 28, wrote letters to top leaders of non-BJP parties, alleging that a recent bill bestowing more powers to the lieutenant governor in Delhi was a “direct attack” on the country’s federal structure.The PM reiterated the party’s target of winning over 200 seats in Bengal’s 294-member assembly.“Some weeks ago, people of Bengal were saying that BJP will get more than 200 seats. But BJP’s strong start in the first phase makes it clear that the voices of people have received God’s blessing. BJP will get more than 200 seats in Bengal,” he said.Modi asked Banerjee to clarify whether there is truth in the rumours that she is going to file nomination for another seat in the last phase of election. “Didi, are you going to fill nomination on another seat? First you went to Nandigram, and the people gave you an answer! Wherever you go, the people of Bengal are ready to give you the right answer.”The TMC supremo is contesting from Nandigram, which voted on Thursday, against former confidant Suvendu Adhikari.During a visit to a polling booth in Nandigram, Banerjee said that the PM’s rallies in the state on the day of polling were a violation of the model code of conduct.“How can Modi campaign on polling day? He is using Doordarshan and other media. Can he do that? People will give a befitting reply,” Banerjee said addressing mediapersons.The PM also hit out at the TMC for calling his recent visit to Bangladesh unethical and violative of the model code of conduct.“I visited one of the 51 Shaktipeeth Jeshoreshwari Kali temple in Bangladesh. TMC has taken umbrage. Is it wrong to pay obeisance to Shri Harichand Thakur (founder of the Matua sect) at Orakandi? I don’t believe in showing seasonal faith (shraddha). We always take pride in our faith and tradition,” he said .The TMC has written to the Election Commission alleging that Modi’s visit violated the model code of conduct in place for the West Bengal Assembly polls and some of his programmes there were “intended to influence the voting pattern” in certain constituencies.Later in the day, Modi addressed a rally in Assam’s Kokrajhar where urged voters to reject the opposition alliance.“In first phase of voting, people of Assam gave NDA [National Democratic Alliance] immense support. They have put the seal on victory of double-engine growth government [at Centre and state]. Thursday’s voting trend [for the second phase] is also very encouraging,” Modi said.Drawing a football analogy, the PM said the people of Assam have shown the “red card” to the Congress-led Grand Alliance in the state. “Football is very popular among youths here. If I use a football term, Congress and its grand-alliance have been shown a red card again by the people of this region. People of the region have faith in NDA for peace, development and respect of Assam’s ‘sanskriti’ (culture),” Modi said.The Congress has allied with Badruddin Ajmal-led All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF), Bodoland People’s Front (BPF), three Left parties and a new regional party for the Assam elections. The combine has been dubbed the “mahajot” or grand alliance.Click here for complete coverage on Assam assembly election 2021The PM also accused previous Congress governments of encouraging encroachment of land belonging to religious establishments and creating divide among various sections, while the NDA, he said, has built bridges of developments.“During Congress’s long rule, Assam was troubled by bomb, ‘bandook’ (guns) and blockade. But during NDA rule there has been peace and respect,” Modi said, adding that it was under former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee that BTR was created and during the NDA government that the Bodo Accord was signed last year. “We want peace, progress and protection in Bodoland,” he said.The Bodoland Territorial Region comprises of four districts in Lower Assam. The districts have 11 assembly seats, all of which will go to polls in the third phase on April 6.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/modi-targets-mamata-at-bengal-rally-congress-aiudf-in-assam-101617302279201.html
02-04-2021||India||Litmus test for Uttarakhand as Mahakumbh begins||The month-long Mahakumbh began in Haridwar on Thursday amid strict Covid-19 restrictions, with chief minister Tirath Singh Rawat assuring devotees that none would be “unnecessarily harassed in the name of Covid-19 restrictions”.The mega event, which generally lasts for four months, has been curtailed this year to one month due to a recent surge in Covid-19 cases in the state with several instances of a significant number of tourists testing positive especially in Rishikesh and Haridwar.The chief minister said the government will ensure strict adherence to guidelines. “Mahakumbh is an event which is the centre of crores of Hindus’ faith and comes after every 12 years. Many people dream of taking the holy dip before their death. Considering all these, the devotees won’t face unnecessary restrictions but they would have to follow the Covid-19 SOP,” the CM said at a press conference.Early in the morning, Mahakumbh officer Deepak Rawat and Mahakumbh inspector general Sanjay Gunjyal offered prayers at the Har ki Pauri Ganga ghat in Mela area.Rawat said that holding the event during the pandemic was a challenge. “Organising it was not an easy task during Covid pandemic but with coordination and hard work, we have made all the arrangements for it to ensure a safe and healthy Mahakumbh with no untoward incident,” Rawat said. Urging devotees to adhere to the Covid-19 guidelines, he said, “The devotees coming here should follow the precautions including wearing a mask and maintaining social distance in the Mela area.”Rawat, who was infected last month, had faced criticism for saying that faith could overcome fear of the virus and mingling with supporters in huge crowds without masks and distancing.Experts recently raised concerns that with nearly 30 to 50 million pilgrims expected to arrive, the state could become a hotspot for the infection. The state government made a negative RT-PCR test mandatory for all those entering the state, particularly after the high court stepped in. Other guidelines included a compulsory registration on the government’s portal for the Mahakumbh.While the state has advised people above the age of 60 or those with significant comorbidities to not attend the Mahakumbh, all attendees have been asked to carry medical reports.The state recorded 500 new cases on Thursday, the highest daily cases this year, taking the tally to 100,911. The last time Uttarakhand reported over 500 cases was on December 23, 2020, when 564 cases were recorded in the state in a single day.The administration has also deployed about 5,000 additional state and central paramilitary forces personnel in the core Kumbh Mela zone of Har-Ki-Pauri, adjacent Ganga ghats and inter-state border check posts.At all nine inter-state border check posts, Indo Tibetan Border Police, Central Industrial Security Force, Central Reserve Police Force, Border Security Force, Provincial Armed Constabulary of Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand along with state police personnel have also been deployed.State director general of police Ashok Kumar said, “About 5,000 security personnel from various Central paramilitary forces and state police have been deployed for the security arrangements on the first day of the mega-event. For peak days, including Shahi Snaans, about 20,000 security personnel would be deployed.”The pilgrim influx is expected to increase around the three Shahi Snans on April 12, April 14 and April 27.The locals, however, questioned the additional security deployment and the stringent Covid-19 restrictions. “I commute from suburban Jwalapur but was checked and asked if I was vaccinated. Mela force personnel also stopped me before I entered the Mela zone. If this is the first day of Kumbh, surely locals and pilgrims will face one month of inconvenience in name of Covid guidelines,” said Tesu Raj, a local priest.Swami Avimuktareshwaranand, head disciple of Shankaracharya Swami Swarupanand Saraswati of Badirnath-Dwarikapeeth, questioned why there were restrictions during the Mahakumbh even as polls are being conducted in four states and a union territory.“For Mahakumbh, we saw strict guidelines with local people having a tough time entering Kumbh mela zone. Negative Covid-19 report is a harsh measure as people can’t bear the cost and they wait 12 years for this sacred dip,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/litmus-test-for-u-khand-as-mahakumbh-begins-101617302278588.html
02-04-2021||India||Panel seeks more data on Russian vaccine, denies emergency use nod||A committee under India’s drug regulator reviewing the emergency approval application of Russia-made coronavirus vaccine Sputnik V has sought more data, refusing on Thursday to clear the dose just yet, government officials aware of the matter said.Sputnik V is the next front-runner for approval in India, with the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation’s (CDSCO) Subject Expert Committee (SEC) reviewing data related to the vaccine’s safety and efficacy.“The application will be heard again after the manufacturers submit the required data that they have been asked such as to put in place a detailed fact-sheet related to the vaccine, and some additional data on vaccine stability etc. The stability data is on how the product behaves at different temperatures as the product has a couple of variants. Our experts will examine the data pertaining to what suits India’s vaccine delivery system,” said an official familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named.Dr Reddy’s labs, which is manufacturing the vaccine after a deal with the vaccine’s developer, is carrying out bridging trials in India and has applied for the approval with interim data. The vaccine’s efficacy is pegged at 91.4% based on the final control point of clinical trials in Russia.In its 144th meeting—held on February 24— to examine Covid-19 related proposal under accelerated approval process, the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) subject expert committee asked the company that presented its case for grant of emergency use authorisation, to come back with more India-specific immunogenicity data.“The firm presented its proposal for grant of permission to import (marketing authorisation) for emergency use of Gam COVID Vac Combined Vector vaccine (Component one and component two) along with the safety & immunogenicity data of Phase II part of Phase II/III clinical trial in India and interim safety, efficacy & immunogenicity data from overseas Phase III clinical trial,” said the subject expert committee in its previous meeting to consider Sputnik’s application, according to the minutes of the meeting made public.“After detailed deliberation, the committee recommended that firm should submit immunogenicity and safety data of Phase II and III trial as per approved protocol for further consideration of the Committee. Further the firm is requested to present its data with more clarity,” the committee recommended.In September 2020, Dr Reddy’s and Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) entered into a partnership to conduct the clinical trials of the Sputnik V vaccine and the rights for distribution in India.Sputnik V developed by the Gamaleya National Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology was registered by the ministry of health of Russia and became the world’s first registered vaccine against COVID-19 based on the established human adenoviral vector platform.Once approved, Sputnik V will be the third vaccine that will be used in India’s Covid-19 immunisation programme that was launched on January 16, this year.India currently has two Covid-19 vaccines approved for use—Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin that is co-developed by Indian Council of Medical Research, and Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine that is locally manufactured by Serum Institute of India under the brand name Covishield.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/panel-seeks-more-data-on-russian-vaccine-denies-emergency-use-nod-101617301799784.html
02-04-2021||India||2.2 million sign up for shots as key leg of vaccine drive kicks off||More than 2.2 million people signed up for coronavirus vaccines and at least 2 million were given shots till 9pm on Thursday, the first day of India’s expanded vaccination drive that comes against a backdrop of a raging second wave of the pandemic, with several cities and regions recording an unprecedented surge in infections.Thursday was the first day anyone above the age of 45 becomes eligible to take part in the vaccination drive, which was restricted to the over-60s and people above 45 but with serious health conditions till last month. The government also asked all states to ensure vaccination centres stay open on all days, including public holidays.In Delhi, long queues were seen at most hospitals and dispensaries.“The government has set a target of immunising everyone over the age of 45 years within the next 40 days. To ensure that happens, we will start creating more and more vaccination centres, train more vaccinators, keep centres open for 12-hours, and motivate people to come and get immunised,” said a senior official from Delhi’s health department, asking not to be named.A similar response from the newly eligible recipients was also recorded in Maharashtra, which has been the worst-hit region over the last month. “Though the exact figures of the addition in the beneficiaries are yet to come, the response has been very good in the state. We have targeted to take daily vaccination up to 4 lakh in next few days,” said Dr Ramaswami N, commissioner, family welfare, and director, National Health Mission in Maharashtra.In Gurugram, private hospitals began setting up camps in office complexes after the government approved such collaboration, further helping vaccine uptake.Officials in Bihar said they estimated close to 40% of the people who got shots on Thursday were in the 45-59 age group, and there was a rush at some hospitals in Patna. One of the vaccinators, who asked not to be named, said the Co-WIN portal was slow, as a result of which document upload and verification took time.The Union health ministry’s Co-WIN dashboard showed 2.2 million people signed up between 9am and 9pm on Thursday, and 2.1 million people got doses throughout the day. The final vaccination numbers for the day are likely to be higher as health workers often feed in data at the end of the day. At its highest, India delivered 3 million doses on March 27.Also Read | Hold vaccine drive on all days in April: Govt to statesAmong the prominent people who took their first shot on Thursday were Union minister Piyush Goyal, Rajya Sabha MP Jyotiraditya Scindia, and Andhra Pradesh chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy.“It is heartening to see the response of people who were waiting to get vaccinated. This is the power of scaling up due to the simplicity in approach by removing the prerequisite of medical certification for comorbidities. As we move ahead, the complexities will have to broken further. Efficient Micro planning and Mobilization can ensure faster vaccine coverage,” said Dr Giridhara R Babu, head of epidemiology, Indian Institute of Public Health.Recipients agreed that the move was welcome. “We have been saying from the beginning, everywhere and on social media, that please open up the vaccination programme, let everyone get it and be free from tension,” news agency Reuters quoted Madhav Singh Rathore, 53, a salesman at a clothes store, who sat among a line of people waiting to get the injection at a Delhi hospital.Union health ministry officials have warned that India’s Covid-19 outbreak has taken a grim turn, with Niti Aayog member VK Paul describing the situation as having “gone from bad to worse” during the government’s weekly briefing on Tuesday.The same day, the Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan wrote to states, urging them to take control of situation. “The current rise in cases ... has the potential of overwhelming healthcare systems unless checked right now,” he wrote, outlining a five steps that included expediting the vaccination process.All-week vaccinations recommended by the Union health ministry is meant to help speed up the process to some extent, a government release said.“This step has been taken after detailed deliberations with the States/Union Territories on 31st March, 2021, to optimally utilise all Covid Vaccination Centres across the public and private sectors to ensure rapid increase in the pace and coverage of Covid vaccination. This decision is in line with the graded and proactive approach employed by the Government of India along with the States/UTs for Covid-19 vaccination.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/22mn-sign-up-as-india-opens-up-vaccine-drive-101617301738529.html
02-04-2021||Today's||On the gender test, India fails — yet again||Whichever way you look at it, India’s 28-point tumble to land at 140 out of 156 countries in the annual World Economic Forum (WEF) gender gap ranking is a fail mark. WEF looks at incontrovertible data on four parameters — education, health, economic opportunity and political empowerment — to reach its conclusions. Within South Asia, only two countries — Pakistan at 153 and Afghanistan at the bottom of the list at 156 — have done worse than us. India’s fall in ranking stems largely from an old crisis: The exit of women from paid work. Since 2011-12, 25 million women, roughly Shanghai’s population, have quit the workforce. If you go back to 2004-05, it’s 47 million. There are a number of reasons why women are quitting paid work. In a nutshell, it is to do with society’s definition of “women’s work”, which is to cook, clean and care for children and the elderly, an unpaid job that increased manifold during the pandemic. Obviously, the more time women spend on unpaid care work, the less they have for paid work. While job loss has hit everyone, data from the Centre of Monitoring Indian Economy tell us that it hit women hardest. In February 2021, female labour force participation shrunk by 9%; for men, it is 1.8%, says economist Mitali Nikore. The worst-hit are urban women where labour force contraction is 32% for the same month, the highest since the start of the pandemic, she says. Sure, other factors have contributed to our fall in rankings. The persistence of low political participation by women; the reduction of the number of women ministers; our ongoing sex ratio-at-birth problem. But, for the first time, the pandemic and its impact on job loss have brought India’s crisis of female employment into the public domain.The WEF report does not look into data from areas such as domestic violence that reportedly shot up during lockdown. It has not considered the impact of the gender digital divide where girls were shut out of online classes because they didn’t have access to smartphones. It did not see how this led to a surge in child marriage in states such as Rajasthan. It has not counted the numbers of women unable to access contraceptive and other health services and the impact of this on unwanted pregnancies and their health. And, yet, limited as it is, one can only hope that the ranking will serve as a wake-up call to government and policymakers. A wake-up call to first set up a national-level task force to study the pandemic’s impact on gender and, next, to suggest possible remedies. The blunt truth is India cannot afford to mutely witness any further erosion in gender rights. To do nothing is to wait for upwards of a century to close the gender gap, warns WEF. We simply cannot afford that wait.Namita Bhandare writes on genderThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/on-the-gender-test-india-fails-yet-again-101617372783870.html
02-04-2021||Today's||For gender equity, India needs a care manifesto||What began as an election promise of wages for housework (WFH) by Kamal Haasan’s Makkal Needhi Maiam (MNM) has become an exciting policy initiative adopted by several political parties. The Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK), Trinamool Congress (TMC), the Congress in Assam, and the Left Democratic Front (LDF) and United Democratic Front (UDF) in Kerala have all promised WFH ranging from ₹500 to ₹3,000 to homemakers.Whether it was driven by political ingenuity or the electoral compulsions of welfare populism, the mainstream recognition by political parties of the disproportionate burden of unpaid domestic and care work (UDCW), performed by anywhere between 160-360 million homemakers, is welcome.WFH exemplifies the spirit of a 2021 Supreme Court (SC) decision where Justice NV Ramana observed that fixing a notional income for a homemaker “becomes a recognition of the work, labour and sacrifices of homemakers and a reflection of changing attitudes” and is in furtherance of our international law obligations and constitutional vision of social equality and dignity. But we cannot stop with election manifestos promising WFH. We urgently need a care manifesto, one which values UDCW as well as paid care work and places care at the heart of a post-pandemic economic recovery process. Also Read | What explains the focus on financial assistance to women in these polls?Consider first the proposals for WFH. Detractors of the MNM’s proposal asked if love could be commodified or how the multitude of UDCW tasks can be measured, evaluated and paid for, or if the husband would become an employer. But parties have addressed these objections by rightly proposing a basic amount by way of an unconditional cash transfer. The DMK and TMC are offering to transfer the cash assistance to women in each household, irrespective of their homemaker status — in effect, a gendered basic income. The LDF is offering a pension. The UDF restricts the payment to homemakers between the ages of 40 and 60 who are not availing its minimum income guarantee scheme.Across the board, however, parties have offered a paltry amount, possibly bearing in mind the burdens on the exchequer. The replacement value of Indian women’s UDCW is estimated to be $612.8 billion. The SC, in a 2001 case, pegged the notional monthly income of a homemaker at ₹3,000; in 2021, it used the state-specific minimum wage of ₹5,547. Any payment below the minimum wage is prohibited by Article 23 of the Constitution, which outlaws forced labour.Parties must, therefore, increase this amount, and extend this payment to unmarried daughters who perform UDCW but are viewed as a burden to be married off; (this may delay marriage and push back against the demand for dowry); and to divorced and separated women who perform UDCW in their natal households. And it should be more than a handout for meeting monthly bills. Political messaging must recognise women’s worth as workers and promote their critical consciousness so that they share UDCW with men in their households and dislodge gendered norms around UDCW.Indian women face compulsory marriage and are reliant on marriage for their economic survival. State-paid WFH will likely enhance a homemaker’s economic bargaining power within marriage, help set time boundaries on UDCW, challenge the ideology of domesticity, even resist domestic violence, help her learn a skill or exit marriage. But WFH, during marriage, is only the beginning. The SC, in assessing compensation for deceased homemakers under the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, recommended reforms in family law to protect women’s economic rights upon divorce. This includes a meaningful and enforceable right to maintenance and a community property regime so that women can realise the full value of their contributions through UDCW to the household’s economic assets.Marriage in India is the hub of social reproduction around which the various spokes of satellite economies of women’s reproductive labour revolve. Millions of women undertake paid work to fit around their unpaid care commitments at home but this is viewed as an extension of UDCW, as “intuitively feminine”, easy work and therefore devalued and underpaid. WFH must be accompanied by wide-ranging reforms so that paid domestic workers, teachers, health workers, Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHAs), anganwadi workers, mid-day meal cooks, nurses, sanitation workers and home-based workers are treated as workers and paid a living wage with the full protection of all labour laws. Further, women often resort to sex work and dancing due to failed marriages; their labour must not be criminalised. Surrogates and egg donors should be compensated for their reproductive labour.A care manifesto would ensure that the census, labour force surveys and time use surveys are restructured to account for the full spectrum of women’s unpaid labour, especially their unpaid economic activity on farms and in household enterprises. It would require the State to invest in building physical infrastructure, which reduces the burdens of UDCW through public services such as water, gas and electricity as well as care infrastructure, through affordable and high-quality creches, nurseries and pre-schools. There must be universal access to food, health care and maternity benefits. Investment in the care infrastructure, including through an urban-rural employment guarantee scheme, can create new jobs which generate longer-lasting economic benefits through direct, indirect and induced employment when compared to investment in construction.Women’s UDCW has long subsidised the State, capital and patriarchy. Political recognition of the value of UDCW through unconditional cash transfers is a globally unprecedented move in the right direction. A care manifesto will, however, help us move beyond tokenistic payments to homemakers to building an economy with a care infrastructure that allows women to combine paid and unpaid work on their own terms, with dignity and respect.Prabha Kotiswaran is at King’s College London. She has drawn on contributions of several feminists at a recent symposium on Wages for HouseworkThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/for-gender-equity-india-needs-a-care-manifesto-101617281458135.html
02-04-2021||Today's||How a new rail line in China will pose a security challenge to India||China’s 14th Five-Year Plan, approved in the recent National People’s Congress’s (NPC) annual session, outlines the Sichuan-Tibet railway line near the China-India border as a key strategic priority.The 1,629km Sichuan–Tibet high-elevation railway line will connect Chengdu, Sichuan province’s capital, to Lhasa, the capital of Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR). The 14th Five-Year plan reportedly highlighted this railway’s central section, from Ya’an in Sichuan to Nyingchi in Tibet, as a key infrastructure project. In November 2020, the Communist Party of China’s general secretary and China’s president, Xi Jinping, said that this railway line’s work is extremely challenging due to the complex geological and climatic conditions and the region’s sensitive environment.This railway line is divided into three sections. The Chengdu-Ya’an section in Sichuan had opened in December 2018, while the construction on the Lhasa-Nyingchi section in Tibet started in 2015. The latter is expected to be completed by June this year. The work on the central section linking Ya’an and Xinduqiao in Sichuan and Bomi and Nyingchi in Tibet will start soon as the public bidding to secure these projects was recently completed.Also Read | China’s plans on Tibet and border infra will pose a threat to India The central section’s construction is the most challenging part and the Chinese state media reports that the entire railway line from Chengdu to Lhasa would be functional by 2030. Upon completion, the railway will be the second to link Tibet with the rest of the country, following the Qinghai-Tibet Railway, which opened in 2006.Xi highlighted the railway’s importance, describing it as “a major step in safeguarding national unity and a significant move in promoting the western region’s economic and social development.” But besides integrating the region through economic and social development, China views this project as integral to its national security architecture.The project facilitates forwarding China’s border security goals with India in two important ways.First, China’s Western Theatre Command (WTC) is tasked with the responsibility for the Indian strategic direction. The WTC hosts the 76th Group Army, 77th Group Army, Tibet Military District and Xinjiang Military District. The 77th Group Army’s multiple infantry, motorised infantry, armoured, artillery, air defence, and special operations brigades are stationed in Chongqing and Sichuan. In case of a Sino-Indian border escalation, like the recent one in eastern Ladakh, the 76th and 77th Group Armies are tasked to mobilise additional support to the Tibet and Xinjiang Military Districts. The 77th Group Army will play a major role in the mobilisation of the forces if there’s an escalation near the Arunachal Pradesh border due to its proximity to the region.Under Xi’s civil-military fusion, there’s a collective effort to mobilise the PLA rapidly and on a large scale, using State, party and private enterprises. This was witnessed in the current Sino-Indian stand-off when additional People’s Liberation Army (PLA) deployment happened through the country’s railroad network.The Sichuan-Tibet railway runs dangerously close to the Indian border near Arunachal Pradesh. Thus, on completion in 2030, it will enhance the PLA’s mobility and connectivity on the border with India, especially in the eastern sector.Second, since the 19th Party Congress, which was held a month after the 2017 Doklam stand-off, Xi has emphasised creating border defence villages as a buffer zone on the border with India. These 624 border defence villages along 21 border counties are to be constructed by 2021. They will be the first line of defence, act as a watch post and curtail the movement of “pro-Dalai Lama forces” across the border.The Sichuan-Tibet railway line runs close to Nyingchi, Cona, Yadong, Lhunze and Medog counties bordering India’s Arunachal Pradesh and Sikkim. On completion, the railway line will enable better control, consolidation and logistics supply to these border villages. Chinese scholars have already hailed this network as vital for delivering “strategic material” on the border. With the completion of this railway link in 2030, the PLA could use this infrastructure to alter the status quo and focus on its second strategic direction — addressing the rising India challenge.Suyash Desai is a research analyst from China Studies Programme at The Takshashila InstitutionThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/how-a-new-rail-line-in-china-will-pose-a-security-challenge-to-india-101617278997764.html
02-04-2021||Editorials||Delhi must impose curbs||India is in the middle of another big surge in Covid-19 infections. On Thursday, it saw 81,413 new cases, the highest since October 1. Maharashtra had 43,183 infections, the highest ever in the state. Out of this, Mumbai alone saw 8,646 cases, the highest ever for any city in the country in a single day so far. The state also had a seven-day average of 36,476 cases, against the first wave peak of 22,148. In Delhi, too, the signs were alarming. It registered 2,790 cases on Thursday, up from 1,819 the day before, and this went up to 3,594 on Friday — a 119-day high. The spike led chief minister (CM) Arvind Kejriwal to acknowledge that the Capital is witnessing its fourth wave.Both the State and citizens are responsible for the situation. Vaccination began on January 16 but three precious months have been inadequately utilised, and the Centre has slipped by not approving more vaccines and not opening it up to all adults. Citizens, for their part, have been reckless. Markets are crowded; people are jostling for space in bars and restaurants; the big fat Indian wedding is back; and thousands are marking festivals together. While vaccination must expand and eligible citizens must take the jab, there is no substitute for Covid-appropriate behaviour. And if citizens are unwilling to exercise caution, the administration must put restrictions in place. Hard lockdowns are not the answer, but states and cities need to impose curbs based on data and science. Pune has done it this week – albeit a tad too late – by closing down bars, restaurants, and hotels, and prohibiting or restricting public events. Mumbai has put curbs too, including a night curfew and a bar on public gatherings of more than five people. But this came too late as well. On Friday, CM Uddhav Thackeray acknowledged that the second wave was more severe than the first, and warned citizens of the possibility of a full lockdown in two days.Delhi had an opportunity to be proactive instead of reactive, and get ahead of the curve. But by refusing to introduce any curbs, and only banking on vaccination and medical infrastructure, the city runs the risk of going down Maharashtra’s path. Governments are understandably cautious because of the economic implications of restrictions, but an unchecked public health crisis will end up taking a much heavier toll. Greater citizen responsibility, aided by the State’s diktat if necessary, and aggressive vaccination, is the only way out. Delhi can still set things right if it acts fast.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/delhi-must-impose-curbs-101617385924953.html
