17-04-2021||News||The science behind super-spreader events||Chris Moore, an expert in virus-spread modelling at the Santa Fe Institute, New Mexico, recently wrote that a virus’s ability to infect is not entirely a property of that virus or its virulence alone, but of “how the virus and human society interact”.The pandemic is raging in India due to multiple reasons, including changes in the behaviour of people (whether vaccinated or unvaccinated), change in the behaviour of virus (in terms of new variants), as well as avoidable mass gatherings — where few infected persons can spur a large outbreak among participants, and which increase the risk of contagion.A super-spreading event, popularly known as SSEV in science, is a physical phenomenon in which communicable diseases spread faster than usual. These situations provide ideal ground for the virus to propagate among crowds in close contact settings, further compounded by actions such as singing, shouting and heavy breathing. Many who get infected then go back to their cities, towns or villages, carrying the virus with them and putting larger populations at risk.Also Read | PM Modi reviews medical oxygen supply in country as Covid-19 cases surgeAs clinical and research scientists, we have learned a lot more about Covid-19 in past 15 months and the data is unambiguous — super-spreading incidents represent an important engine of transmission. They not only propel the growth of new infections but can also facilitate genetic drifts in virus genome that might be responsible for some new strains and mutations.Size matters. As the numbers increases, so does the risk of transmitting the virus to a wider cluster. A large assembly size increases the possibility that someone present in the group will be asymptomatic but infectious. Many studies suggest that 10-20% of infected people are responsible for 80% of the spread of Sars-Cov-2. Infected individuals can remain asymptomatic in the first five to six days, and around 40% of transmission occurs during this period. The longer they come into contact with other people (especially if that contact is longer than 15 minutes, which is the case in most of these events), the more ideal it is for the virus to spread quickly and rampantly.Persons shedding high volume of virus can result in new infections that are of high viral replication, generating a ripple effect, causing severe disease with higher morbidity and mortality. A study from South India published in Science last year revealed that in case super-spreading events predominate, then as low as 8% of infected people may be responsible for 60-80% of the secondary cases of Covid-19 in the community. This is crucial as it increases the effective R0 of virus. Cases could, thus, explode in a very short period of time if we continue to have series of these events, thereby causing what is called Domino’s effect.Amid the surge of Covid-19 infections, such events are still taking place. The following steps must be taken immediately.One, science tells us that if we clamp down on these large mass gatherings of susceptible people, and the virus is denied favourable circumstances for a spread, the rate of infections will slow.Second, individuals who head back to their homes after such an event, and may be carrying the virus, should be mandated to be under self-isolation for a week after their return to slow the further spread.Third, extensive testing should be carried out in as many of these people on their return to their homes. Research shows that if we encourage people to get tested, they become aware of their infection status and the consequent dangers, and are more likely to adhere to non pharmacological measures and change their behaviour.Fourth, the concept of backward contact tracing needs to be aggressively pursued, which can help find other infectious people from the same event. This can be quite useful in detecting more chains of transmission and slowing the virus.The virus is rampant and here to stay. We need to be vigilant, more now than ever.Rajinder K Dhamija is the head of neurology department, Lady Hardinge Medical College and SSK Hospital, New Delhi.

She also said those returning may end up spreading the infection like ‘Prasad’.Meanwhile, on Saturday Mumbai reported 8,811 cases followed by 51 deaths. This took the total case tally to 571,018 and the death toll to 12,301. The city’s recovery rate is 82% with 471,080 recoveries. The city’s mortality rate is 2.15% and there are 86,433 active cases in the city.Speaking to reporters on Saturday, Pednekar said, “Those returning from Kumbh Mela may end up spreading Covid-19 like prasad, and hence we should be able to trace those returning from Kumbh Mela. We need to be religious to get strength but right now we need to develop inner strength.”Pednekar said, “We cannot stop anyone from going, but the only thing we can do is to take caution. As a mayor, my opinion is to quarantine those returning to hotels, but there are some decisions that Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) cannot take on its own. It will require guidelines from the state or the central government.”The statement of the mayor comes after over 2,000 tested positive for Covid in Haridwar after attending Kumbh Mela.According to BMC officials, they will wait for the state government to issue any such guidelines for quarantining patients coming from Kumbh Mela.A BMC official said, “We will need guidelines from the state government for quarantining patients coming from Kumbh Mela. But this exercise will also need more clarity on how to trace such travellers considering BMC does not have any data on how many have attended Kumbh Mela from Mumbai. It will be difficult to trace such patients.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/those-returning-from-kumbh-mela-should-be-quarantined-for-10-days-mumbai-mayor-101618683981803.html
17-04-2021||Mumbai||Colour-coded stickers must to ply within Mumbai: Top cop||To check on motorists taking to roads for no valid reasons or trivial work and causing traffic jams, Mumbai police commissioner (CP) Hemant Nagrale on Saturday announced self colour coding of vehicles plying in Mumbai. The police chief appealed to the citizens to follow the rule, which would come in force from Sunday 7am and will remain effective till May 1, 7am. The order came after the entry-exit points at Dahisar, Mulund and Vashi, and some other parts of the city saw long traffic jams because of police nakabandi and check on on those flouting lockdown rules. This caused interruptions in movements of ambulances and other essential service vehicles. Following this, the top brass of the police department decided to impose some restrictions on the movement of non-essential vehicles.Nagrale through a video message announced mandatory colour coding for vehicles in Mumbai to limit the vehicle flow.He said that red stickers would be a must for vehicles of the medical fraternity people like doctors, paramedics ambulance, and also for vehicles supplying medicines and medical and testing equipment.Essential service vehicles like that of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), electricity suppliers, telephone exchanges, press, and all those services which treated as essential services will be required to carry yellow stickers for easy identification.Green stickers would be required for the vehicles carrying vegetables, fruits, grocery, dairy products, bakery products, etc.All motorists (including the two wheelers) who fall under these categories have to put respective stickers on their vehicles. The stickers have to be pasted on the front and rear side of the vehicle and must be properly visible. They should be round and of a minimum of six inches in diameter. The police will also provide these stickers to the eligible motorists at the toll plazas and check posts free of cost, the commissioner said in his message.“The stickers would facilitate easy movement of essential service vehicles. If anyone tries to misuse the stickers or paste on their vehicle knowing that their vehicle doesn’t fall under the eligible categories, then those motorists would be prosecuted under relevant legal provisions,” Nagrale said.The decision aims to restrict the vehicular movement of unwanted vehicles during the lockdown and ensure no traffic jams at the entry-exit points and toll nakas for uninterrupted movement of ambulances, vehicles for doctors and nursing staffs. “Those vehicles which are coming to the city from other districts and states, and falls under the allowed categories would be given stickers by the police. The police will allow them entry into the city while rest will be barred from entering the city without any valid reasons,” said deputy commissioner of police (operation) Chaitanya Siriprolu, who is also the spokesperson for Mumbai Police. The deputy commissioner of police also added that the said order of colour coding has been issued under section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/colourcoded-stickers-must-to-ply-within-mumbai-top-cop-101618683861831.html
17-04-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Taxi and autorickshaw drivers demand more monetary relief||Taxi and autorickshaw unions have written to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray asking to provide a financial relief of ₹5,000 each to autorickshaw and taxi drivers in the state. They have further said that they will agitate if their demands are not met.The demand was made after the state on Tuesday imposed stricter restrictions across the state under Break the Chain initiative and declared a financial relief of ₹1,500 each for all registered auto and taxi drivers in the state.Citing the financial relief as insufficient, taxi and auto unions have asked for more monetary relief.“It is discrimination on the part of the state government. The operation of taxis in the city and state has been an old trade. Providing ₹1,500 is not enough, and the monetary relief should be increased. When the Delhi government can give ₹5,000 to drivers, why can’t the Maharashtra government? We have written to the government to provide ₹5,000 to every auto and taxi driver,” said AL Quadros, leader of Mumbai Taxi Men’s Union.Auto unions said if monetary relief is not increased, they would start agitation. “Surviving on ₹1,500 is very difficult. The situation of drivers across the state is bad. How will the drivers pay the vehicle loan amount? We had earlier asked for ₹10,000 for every driver, but we are getting just ₹1,500. This is not enough for the drivers and their families to survive. If the state government fails to increase the amount, we will be forced to start agitation,” said Shashank Rao, leader of Autorickshaw Men’s Union.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-taxi-and-autorickshaw-drivers-demand-more-monetary-relief-101618683801868.html

The state also added 419 fatalities due to Covid-19, the highest in 197 days since October 2, when 424 deaths were reported.The death toll rose to 59,970 and the state is expected to cross the 60,000-mark on Sunday. Maharashtra continued to report over 60,000 cases for the third consecutive day on Saturday taking the tally to 3,770,707. The active case count in the state rose to 647,933. Mumbai, meanwhile, added 8,811 fresh Covid-19 infections taking its tally to 571,018. The death toll increased by 51 fatalities, pushing it to 12,301.Even as the state is battling the second wave of Covid, chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray on Saturday asked the industry leaders to draw up a plan to tackle the third wave of coronavirus. Thackeray also reached out to industry leaders from the state and sought their assistance in the fight against Covid-19. The chief minister sought help in the production and supply of oxygen, increasing health infrastructure, setting up laboratories, and speeding up vaccinations. The CM appealed to the corporate community to set up oxygen production plants using modern technology in their premises and to assist the state with its supply.The virtual meeting was held with the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce & Industry (FICCI), Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), including Uday Kotak, Niranjan Hiranandani, Harsh Goenka, Sanjeev Bajaj, Naushad Forbes, SN Subramanian, among others. “If the third wave comes, the industries have to ensure that it does not harm the business and the economy. It should adopt the appropriate working method and set up Covid-related facilities,” Thackeray said, according to the statement from the chief ministers’ office (CMO).Thackeray further said that today nobody can predict how many such waves of Covid will come. “But now the industries in the state have to do the necessary planning, to face the coming wave,” he added. Thackeray also said that a task force consisting of industrialists for better coordination will be set up on the lines of the Covid task force.The CM further suggested them to adopt the Covid-19 appropriate working method, setting up testing and vaccination facilities, creating special systems for the health of workers and employees, setting up isolation facilities within industry premises, developing work-from-home mechanism, and staggering work hours, etc.Thackeray also said that the state is in dire need of oxygen and the government is hopeful that the Centre will provide all assistance. “We are in dire need of oxygen as the cases have surged. Currently, oxygen produced in the state is diverted for medical use. We will further need more oxygen looking at the rising cases. I wasn’t able to speak to the Prime Minister on this issue yesterday, as he is busy with the elections in West Bengal. But we are hopeful that we will receive all assistance from them,” said Thackeray, according to the CMO statement.During the meeting with industrialists, they were given an overview of the Covid situation in the state. Principal secretary of health department Dr Pradeep Vyas said that the Covid cases in the state are on the rise and the doubling rate has fallen to merely 40 days and with the cases on the rise, the requirement for oxygen is expected to go up.As cases and fatalities continue to mount in the state, the Maharashtra government is working to fill in the shortfall of medical use of oxygen and remdesivir injections. State health minister Rajesh Tope held a meeting with Dr Harsh Vardhan, Union health minister, and said that the supply of oxygen has started from other states, while adequate availability of remdesivir will happen in the next two to three days.“We have 1,500 metric ton of oxygen available with us and we use it only for medical use. A schedule has been prepared to transport oxygen from various states to Maharashtra from April 15. The Union home secretary has also directed all the states to not stop the oxygen coming to Maharashtra. We have sought help for tankers from the Centre, we have also asked to supply through cryogenic tanks on railway wagons. The Centre has given 162 oxygen generator projects to many states, we too expect that Maharashtra will get some,” he said in Jalna after the meeting.Tope added that industries are also pitching to help out the state for oxygen supply. “[Representatives from] JSW Steel has said that it would be able to provide 195MT oxygen daily after five days. Additional 200MT will also be provided by them in the coming days. Many industry heads have said that it will also provide oxygen cylinders.”On the availability of remdesivir drug, Tope said that the state has reiterated its demand to allow the use of the ready stock of the exporter. “As many as 15 exporters have finished product available and we again asked them (Centre) to supply it to Maharashtra,” he said.Meanwhile, the rising deaths are being attributed to late detection and admission to hospitals by the health department. Besides Mumbai, Ahmednagar district added 51 fatalities followed by Nagpur and Nanded districts with 34 deaths each. Pune district, which added 12,825 fresh cases, reported 30 deaths. Jalgaon district added 29 deaths, while Thane district, which has five municipal corporations and rural areas, added 27 deaths. Yavatmal district reported 13 deaths, while Latur and Osmanabad districts added 12 deaths each.Officials expect the Covid-19 cases to stabilise in a few days. TP Lahane, director of the Directorate of Medical Education and Research, said, “The lockdown will be beneficial. We expect the numbers to come down after seven days since the strict restrictions are imposed.” Officials are expected to take a review of the situation in the next week.Even as ministers have warned of stricter restrictions and a total lockdown, Tope said that a decision would be taken after the 15-day curfew ends. “We have taken this decision even though it has inconvenienced many. We want this decision to succeed and appeal to people to not step out of their homes unless necessary. Let us first finish the 15 days and then examine the situation. We will take further decision [on extension] based on the situation at that time,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-records-67-123-cases-highest-single-day-count-till-date-101618683741858.html

A signboard, reading that the property belongs to the bank, has also been erected on the land.Tajinder Kumar, one of the shopkeepers, while showing rent slips paid to the bank, said the property was pledged to Ludhiana Central Cooperative Bank. “When mayor Balkar Singh Sandhu and MLA Rakesh Pandey arrived at the site in March, I had apprised them of the land’s status. But, like other shopkeepers, I was dismissed,” he claimed.Another shopkeeper, who is paying rent to the bank, said a shopping mart was opened in the area decades ago, but after the concept failed, the bank took control of the land.Despite repeated attempts, bank officials refused to comment on the issue.When contacted, mayor Sandhu said he had marked an inquiry into the matter. “The record states that the land belongs to the municipal corporation. To clear this out, I have sought an inquiry. If the land indeed belongs to the civic body, we will take over the property, else another chunk of land will be identified for the park,” he added.Congress MLA Rakesh Pandey, who is recuperating from Covid-19, was not available for a comment.The land in question is located right in the heart of old city and connects Field Ganj, Lakkar Bazaar, Nawan Mohalla and other areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/site-identified-for-public-park-in-ludhiana-turns-out-to-be-bank-property-101618680982325.html

Patna reported maximum number of cases (1898) while Gaya reported 610. The number of cases also increased in Muzaffarpur, which recorded 541 cases. The total number of active cases in the state was 39,497, with Patna alone accounting for 12,118. The recovery rate in the state stands at 86.93%. According to government data, 34 people lost their life due to Covid in last 24 hours. “The infection is spreading very fast and this is the highest reporting of positive cases so far,” Amrit said. Meanwhile, the state government, in an effort to resolve the problem of oxygen shortage, set up a control room to monitor the availability and distribution in a better way. “The control room will monitor the requirement of oxygen in medical institutions of the state and ensure they get an uninterrupted supply,” said Amrit.He said oxygen containers from Bokaro will start reaching the state from Saturday night. “We have asked the two major suppliers Linde India and Inox Air Products Ltd to supply medical oxygen on a daily basis, instead of alternate days now,” said Amrit. Bihar has to essentially rely on West Bengal and Jharkhand for supply of medical oxygen through distributors. “The additional chief secretary (Industry) is also holding talks with different stakeholders for uninterrupted supply of oxygen,” he said.Govt should stop discrimination: IMA Senior vice-president of IMA (Bihar) Dr Ajay Kumar, said government should stop discrimination between registered (under Bihar Clinical Registration act) and unregistered clinical establishments run by registered doctors. “Government is utilizing services of unregistered clinics under PM Arogya Yojana, but it’s not allowing clinics having ICUs and other facilities to treat Covid patients . Since yesterday, district officers have stopped supply of oxygen to unregistered clinics threatening lives of patients admitted there,” he said.He said allowing private unregistered clinics to treat Covid patients will create an additional 1000 Covid beds and 200 ICUs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bihar-moves-to-procure-remdesivir-stocks-more-oxygen-supply-as-cases-surge-101618677801448.html
17-04-2021||Other||Decision on further steps on Sunday, says CM after all-party meeting||PATNAThe Bihar government will announce further measures to contain the spread of coronavirus on Sunday after seeking reports from all the district magistrates, chief minister Nitish Kumar said on Saturday as he emerged from the all-party meeting called by Governor Phagu Chouhan to discuss the situation.According to sources, though there was no unanimity at the meeting on enforcing a lockdown, BJP’s state president Sanjay Kumar Jaiswal suggested a weekend lockdown advancing summer vacation in schools to April 18. JD-U state president Umesh Kushwaha suggested adequate stock of medicines, ventilators and oxygen. RJD’s Tejaswhi Prasad Yadav, who is leader of Opposition, was critical of the government’s preparedness and wanted adequate time to be given to people if the government wanted to enforce a lockdown. “The government may announce further strict measures to break the chain on one hand and augment testing, vaccination and facilities in hospitals on the other,” sources said. After the meeting, Kumar said the crisis management group was meeting later in the evening to discuss and decide further steps to be taken. “The number of Covid-19 cases has again risen today and the trend continues,” he said. With over 6,250 cases reported in the state in the last 24 hours, the number of active cases has gone past 33,000 mark, a far cry from just 350 active cases health minister Mangal Pandey had said on the floor of the state Assembly earlier. As a result, hospitals in the state are under stress and shortage of important medicines and oxygen reported from many places. “In view of growing number of cases, I have already talked to Medanta Hospita chairman Dr Naresh Trehan to convert the newly built Medanta Hospital in Patna as a dedicated Covid hospital. The government is also conscious about availability of oxygen and medicines,” the CM said in his address. “Tomorrow, I will hold a video conference with all the DMs to know the status in other parts of the state, after which the government will announce further measures, as required. The suggestions received today will also be taken into account,” the CM said. Parliamentary affairs minister Vijay Kumar Choudhary said the government had briefed leaders from all the political parties of the status of health facilities for Covid, vis-à-vis last year when the pandemic was first reported in Bihar. “The unprecedented crisis has caught the entire world off-guard due to its sheer magnitude and rendered all facilities inadequate. It is time for all to contribute selflessly for the sake of humanity, not to settle scores,” he said. Tejaswhi Yadav raised the issue of inadequate testing and vaccination, besides lack of facilities in hospitals. He said if the government had any plans of announcing lockdown, it must give adequate time for the people stranded outside to return home. “I have given 30 suggestions to the government, but I doubt it would work on any of them. The government does not listen. It has failed,” he said. He had tweeted minutes before the meeting started: “Last year also, I was continuously cooperating and suggesting concrete measures, but the CM hardly cared for such positive suggestions. Even I had challenged him to speak on steps taken by him. Still, they have no sense of responsibility. May God save our Bihar.” Representatives of Congress, HAM-S, CPI-ML, CPI, VIP and others also joined the meeting, which was held online. CPI-ML wanted the age bar vaccination removed and said it did not favour lockdown due to bitter experience last time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/decision-on-further-steps-on-sunday-says-cm-after-all-party-meeting-101618677562495.html

When Mandke agreed to pay, they took him to an ATM in Kondhwa and had him withdraw ₹65,000 using separate ATM cards and later took one of the cards from him along with its PIN. They then made him sit in an autorickshaw and asked him to go home without informing anyone. “After the amount he had withdrawn, the next day they used his card to withdraw ₹4,000 and ₹9,500 the day after that and threatened him to not talk about it,” said PSI Usgaonkar. A case under Sections 170, 364(a), 386, 323, 504, and 34 of the Indian Penal Code was registered at Bibwewadi police station against the unidentified people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/two-held-for-kidnapping-extortion-101618676901492.html

In 2021, there have been a slew of cases where the central state of Madhya Pradesh has figured prominently in smuggling of weapons to criminals in Punjab. “Apart from seizing 42 pistols in two operations, we have seized 30 pistols from criminals since January. After arrest, these men have told us that they had brought the weapons from MP. The state has become one of the hot spots of weapon smuggling for Punjab criminals,” said senior superintendent of police (SSP-rural) Dhruv Dahiya, adding that they now wanted to break the networking chain. It started in January when the Amritsar Rural police arrested two persons, Mahesh Selotia and Jaggu, and recovered 12 pistols of .32 bore from them. Rahul of Pachori village of Burhanpur district in MP is the kingpin of smuggling weapons into Punjab. Patiala Police have also registered a case against him for involvement in a case where six pistols were seized. “Our teams are working to identify Punjab-based criminals who have been in touch with MP-based smugglers for supply of weapons,” SSP Dahiya added. Another senior police official, part of the investigation team, said, “The main hub of the weapons’ production and supply is Dhar, Khagar and Burhanpur districts in Madhya Pradesh. Some members of the Siklighar community in remote areas of these districts are actively involved. They charge between ₹15,000 and ₹20,000 per pistol from Punjab criminals. These pistols look like professional ones, are lethal and carefully designed. Many criminals arrested recently have told us that they preferred weapons from MP, as they were designed like foreign pistols.”He said, “We have found that some miscreants and gangsters lodged in Punjab jails are in touch with the key MP-based accused, Rahul. Some of these men may be arrested. After 12 pistols were seized in MP in January, the name of Akashdeep, the main accused in the drone-module case lodged in Amritsar jail, had surfaced. Akashdeep had been in contact with Rahul. Patiala Police took him into custody, when six pistols were seized.” Akashdeep is suspected to be a operative of the Khalistan Zindabad Force (KZF) terror module that was busted in September 2019. A Tarn Taran police official said over the past two months they had arrested over a dozen criminals, who have confessed to smuggling of weapons from MP. On Friday, police had said that MP-based smugglers use social media to establish their network in Punjab.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/mp-emerging-as-hot-spot-for-weapon-smuggling-in-punjab-101618675221809.html
17-04-2021||Pune||PMC relaxes Covid test guidelines for hotel staff, e-commerce employees, and domestic helpers||PUNE The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has relaxed its earlier guidelines by allowing employees engaged in various services to operate without a mandatory RT-PCR test. The decision was taken in light of the pressure on laboratories and testing centres at present due to the rising Covid-19 cases. In an order on Saturday, PMC Commissioner Vikram Kumar allowed employees of e-commerce companies, restaurant and hotel staff, drivers, domestic help and employees engaged in printing and circulation of newspapers to operate without undergoing Covid tests. Earlier, under the break the chain notification, the Maharashtra government had made it mandatory for persons engaged in these services along with industries to undergo a RT-PCR every fortnight. As the government made it mandatory for all these people, it led to the burden on laboratories, finally resulting in delay for others in procuring their reports. The PMC order however does not offer guidelines on test for workers engaged in various industries. Many including those with severe symptoms also complained that they were not getting their reports within 48 hours due to which their hospitalisation was also delayed. Considering this, Vikram Kumar issued a fresh circular offering the relaxations.However, the municipal commissioner appealed to them to get their vaccination done as early as possible.Kumar also allowed shops engaged in providing raw material to the industries to operate. However, these shop or suppliers have been asked only to carry out point-to-point sell and no retail trading. MCCIA welcomed the PMC decision of allowing shops to supply raw material. “We are thankful to the PMC for considering our request. The industries depend on some shops that sell critical raw material, and these are an inseparable part of the entire supply chain,” MCCIA director-general Prashant Girbane said. The municipal commissioner has allowed eateries to provide parcels until 8 PM in the evening from the earlier 6pm.Guidelines on Ramzan celebrationsThe PMC has appealed to celebrate Ramzan at home, avoiding gathering at public places. As the month of Ramazan is ongoing, PMC municipal commissioner Vikram Kumar issued guidelines and asked not to celebrate the festival at masjids or public places. Usually during this month, people used to go to Masjid for namaz but they should stay at home this year. This year on the last Friday, they should stay at home only and prefer to attend the prayers online. During Ramzan, no permission will be given to carry any procession or organise any religious, social or cultural programme. The leaders from Muslim community should come forward and appeal citizens to stay at home. 100% oxygen supply to hospitals The PMC has mandated manufacturers to supply 100 per cent oxygen for medical purpose. In his order on Saturday, PMC commissioner Vikram Kumar has asked manufacturers from Pune to ensure 100 per cent supply only for medical purpose as hospitals are facing an unprecedented shortage. The PMC has also allowed shops selling liquor to sell using home delivery between 7 am to 6 pm between Monday to Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pmc-relaxes-covid-test-guidelines-for-hotel-staff-e-commerce-employees-and-domestic-helpers-101618673361226.html

The PRTC recorded daily revenue of ₹1.35 crore in March. Since April 1, however, the average daily income has been between ₹75 lakh and ₹80 lakh. In the state budget presented in the assembly on March 8, the government had expanded the scope of the scheme to cover students studying in government colleges too. The government had set aside ₹170 crore to fund the scheme. The government freebie, for now, has meant that it will struggle to meet committed expenses, including diesel cost. Nirmal Singh Dhaliwal, convener, PRTC-linked trade unions, said, the figures of the first fortnight presented a grim financial situation, and it was going to worsen over time. “How will the corporation pay for its diesel and salaries?” Dhaliwal questioned, adding that, “The corporation spends around ₹65 lakh a day on diesel for running its full fleet of 1,073 buses, while the daily salary and pension bill is pegged at ₹55 lakh.”PRTC needs at least ₹19 crore a month to pay salaries and pensions to its employees. “With the present income, the corporation will struggle to meet its expenditure. We are going to meet the PRTC management to press upon the government to give the earmarked ₹170 crore in advance, so that the corporation is spared the financial burden,” Dhaliwal added.PRTC managing director Bhupinderpal Singh said they are taking up the matter with the government. “We will meet senior officers to apprise them of the fresh financial situation,” he said. Chairman KK Sharma said they were providing daily receipt of figures to the transport secretary. “We are working on logistics so that the corporation does any face shortage of funds,” he added.The PRTC runs buses from nine depots of Ludhiana, Kapurthala, Chandigarh, Patiala, Bathinda, Budhlada, Barnala, Faridkot and Sangrur. It has also approached the state government for a ₹90 crore bailout package to compensate for losses it incurred, during and after the coronavirus-induced lockdown. The first 60 days of the complete lockdown last year had caused a loss of ₹51 crore to the PRTC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/prtc-income-dips-45-on-free-travel-for-women-government-college-students-101618671201684.html

17-04-2021||Delhi||Action against hospitals, labs: Kejriwal's plan to step up Covid fight in Delhi||Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Saturday said the Covid-19 situation of the Capital is concerning as Delhi is breaching grim milestones every day as far as the number of fresh infections is concerned. Around 24,000 new Covid-19 cases have been reported in Delhi on Saturday and nearly 19,500 cases were seen on Friday. The positivity rate has now climbed to over 24 per cent and the situation is worrying.Here is Delhi's present Covid-19 situation in 10 points1. Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said there is a shortage of oxygen and the antiviral drug Remdesivir in the capital.2. Pointing out that any health infrastructure has its own limitations, Kejriwal said there are a limited number of oxygen beds and Intensive Care Unit (ICU) beds for the infected patients. However, he assured the Aam Aadmi Party led government is working towards increasing the number of these beds.3. “Several steps are being taken by the Delhi government to increase the number of beds and I hope in the coming 2-4 days, we are able to increase them on a large scale,” Kejriwal said adding the main objective is to create more oxygen beds for the seriously infected patients.4. As the cases have been spiking in Delhi, the CM said no one knows when the peak will come and there should be no laxity and all must be fully prepared to be one step ahead of the Covid-19 disease if the situation worsens.5. Kejriwal said he spoke to Union health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan where he highlighted the shortage of beds in Delhi and urged Vardhan to reserve 50 per cent beds of the central government hospitals. “I spoke to the health minister over the shortage of oxygen in Delhi and requested its immediate supply. I also informed him about the shortage of the Remdesivir and Tocilizumab drugs,” Kejriwal added.Also Read| Don't know when peak will come, says Kejriwal as Delhi reports 24K covid cases6. Amid reports there is black marketing of Covid-related medicines due to their shortage, CM Kejriwal said he directed officials to raid and order strict enquiry against such people who are engaged in hoarding and black marketing of the medicines.7. “Delhi is the only city in India where results of Covid-19 tests would be given in 24 hours. However, there have been complaints that in recent days, it is taking 3-4 days to produce the results of these tests. The reason for this is some labs have started picking up samples more than their capacity. Please understand the problem. Suppose if a serious patient gave his/her sample today, and if the results come after 3-4 days, the patient might die. Strict enquiry will be ordered against such labs which pick up samples over their capacity and not giving results within 24 hours,” the Delhi CM said.8. Speaking again on the beds available for Covid patients across Delhi, Kejriwal said there is an app by the government where real-time details are given to people about the number of beds occupied and vacant in a hospital. The app is not operated by the government and a password has been given to every hospital to fill details, he added.Also Read| Hospitals turning away patients despite beds availbility to face action: Sisodia9.

At the same time, big construction sites are operating uninterrupted as the government has allowed the functioning of in-situ sites.The labour pick-up points at Hadapsar, Warje and Bhosari continues to have a footfall of more than 200 workers every day.“Government has given permission to continue work at big sites, but in the city, there are many small works are undertaken like – construction of gardens in housing societies or constructing a compound wall and for such small work how should we arrange accommodation for the workers. There should have been some relaxation for daily wage workers so it could have benefited all,” said Jagan Ram, a contractor who provides daily jobs to workers in Hadapsar.The order has also impacted residents in many localities as they are not allowed to call workers for the renovation work.“I have to change the floor carpet of my house. If there was a relaxation for such work then my society members would have allowed renovation work at my house,” said Rohan Patil, Sunita Parks, Kothrud.The situation is gruesome for some workers as they don’t even have money to return back home.“I earn ₹500 per day. For the last three days, I have earned nothing. Even If I plan to visit my home town in Gaya, Bihar, I don’t have money to get a railway ticket. What work I will do there is another problem. We are ready to undergo Covid test, but we should be allowed to work,” said Vikal Shinde, who works as a labourer at Hadapsar.Sanjay Hiwrale, who works as labourer at Yerawada said, “For the last seven years I have been working on construction sites. Today I went to work at Vishrantwadi with six other workers and we were sent back by police as we don’t have accommodation on the site. Even our site engineer had no option, but to stop the work. If I don’t have work for 15 days then it becomes difficult to pay rents and electric bills.”Anita Lashkare, a daily wage worker, said, “Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) is not doing anything for daily wage workers. According to the 2018 GR from the state government, if person has worked for more than 90 days in a year then they should be registered with the Board of Construction Workers (BCOW), but PMC has not given any such certificates to us till now.”The state government has announced a transfer of ₹1,500 to construction workers registered with BOCW.“While welfare provisions of BOCW partly compensates it and provides basic social security net to such workers, the inaction by PMC obstructs the process condemning these workers to misery,” said B Youvraj, social activist, New Socialist Alternative.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/daily-wage-workers-at-smaller-construction-sites-in-pune-struggle-to-make-ends-meet-101618662980620.html

Explaining the concept, Agarwal said, “It was an email drafting service for the small and medium sized businesses in Japan. My previous work experience at Japan had prompted me to start this venture with my lawyer friend. However, that did not turn out well and I took an exit after two years of running the start-up.”How Proctur was bornAfter the exit, Agarwal was exploring opportunities. Says Agarwal, “I used to observe my sister, faculty at a coaching institute. She carried around many books and managed a myriad of tasks manually every day. In the evening, she used to call parents and inform them about their child’s attendance and marks. I realised that technology usage in the coaching classes segment is very low and that segment is in a very nascent stage.”“I did some research and thought why not digitise the coaching classes. The idea of Proctur was conceived to address the pain points of traditional coaching institutes and students. I was also concerned about the growth of students in this vicinity as they were being deprived of the benefits that come with the implementation of technology in the education sector. During my travels through the country, I realised that it was quite worrisome that a majority of the population did not have access to quality education. In fact, some areas had no access to education at all. I deeply thought about different ways in which I could help both the teachers and the students,” he stated.First step – A simple interactive platformSays Agarwal, “Initially, we developed a simple platform where tutors of coaching classes can interact with parents easily, via SMS and other communication channels, using mobile apps. We did not have any tech background. I had a strong product background and experience. So, we hired some freelance developers to develop the product. I was guiding them and it took four to six months to launch the initial version. Meanwhile, we had already started getting some clients. Hunny Tutorial in Delhi was the first coaching class which became our client. We were just walking around on a Sunday afternoon and trying to visit some coaching classes. At that time nobody was using software and our product was also “half-cooked”. Still, he believed in us and appreciates us even today.”Says Nitin Agrawal, who was the first employee, “I was hired for a sales role in Proctur. I was pretty shy, but took it as an opportunity and started my journey with Proctur. Later I moved to client servicing team as an executive and started interacting with the clients. Interacting with the tech team and improving the product life cycle, Proctur has helped me grow. Currently, I am product manager and looking after the overall product development.”As the venture started to grow, the company realised that the problem they were trying to solve was much bigger than it seemed at first glance. Says Nishant Agarwal, “We needed to address all components of the education system – including students, educators, and parents to get the desired results. We also found that it was necessary to address the educational needs as well as the non-educational needs of the students, simultaneously. From the very beginning, Proctur focused on affordability, so that the majority of the population can benefit from the venture. This is where the school segment came into the picture. All of this culminated in the creation of two verticals, catering to the vast unorganized sector of educational institutes as well as the organized sector comprising the schools.”Agarwal has been into this space for close to five years now. He says, “We now provide a unique offering of a combination of ERP and learning management system (LMS). We help coaching classes and schools to digitise their operational part like fees, attendance, exams, etc. At the same time, they are able to sell their courses online using our platform. They are able to conduct live classes, share videos with the students, online assignments, online tests, etc. We provide complete end-to-end ‘blended learning solution’ as we call it.”Shifting to PuneThe private coaching classes industry is evolving. Agarwal said, “Online educators have offline presence for sure, but there is no as such exclusive online education provider in India. Considering this fact, we thought it is better to move to a city wherein it is easy to get resources and where it is easy to access new and young minds. We decided to move to Pune which is known to be an education hub of India and a tech hub as well, probably after Bengaluru.”“Earlier we had a team strength of 40 employees in November 2020. Within a few months of shifting, we have onboarded more than hundred coaching classes from in and around Pune. Now we have doubled our team size to almost 90 members,” he added.Pandemic accelerated changesOn the effects of Covid-19 pandemic and consequent lockdown, Agarwal says, “We always believed in ‘blended learning’. We had developed the solution of live classes, online tests solutions much before pandemic happened. Due to Covid-19, we have gone at least two to three years ahead of time. The pace at which people are adapting to our solutions, we were expecting that to happen in the next couple of years. It was good to have earlier, but now it is a must-have.”“With the uncertainty of face-to-face teaching, coaching classes have now become confident of using online software’s. They don’t even ask for a demo and directly go for the purchase. This is a big change in mindset. Also, another visible change is that the product usage has gone very high now. Earlier, institutes were using only 30 to 50 per cent of features that were provided, but now they use almost 80 to 90 per cent of them. Before Covid-19 outbreak, most classes functioned offline and hence scheduling, attendance and sharing exam marks was important task for them besides the fees collection. After Covid-19, online fees collection is most in-demand feature followed by online teaching, live platforms, video sharing and online tests,” Agarwal explained.“We have started an office in Noida in April to cater to the northern region clients. We are also hiring for offline sales team. Presently, the entire team is remote-working due to lockdowns and Covid-19 outbreak, the lead generation is done using online marketing tools and advertisements on Facebook, Google, etc. Demo is arranged through mobile or laptop for the prospective clients. They are provided with training on using different features and motivated to use them all,” he added.Future plansSays Agarwal, “We are a bootstrapped start-up. Our vision is to automate and help streamline management of educational institutes by providing app-based interfaces to key stakeholders in the education industry. We don’t want to be only a software sales company. Our mission is to build a service platform for enhancing student learning and bringing innovation to the rapidly progressing field of education. We are generating a user base on which we can start offering our value-added services. So, it won’t be B2B company but it will be B2B2C. So far we did not go for any institutional investor but now we are looking to raise funds.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/education-solutions-for-the-eclassroom-101618660881630.html

But the government is denying us our legitimate right,” Dr Narula.On the other hand, rural development minister Tript Rajinder Bajwa said that talks were on with the association members to end the current impasse. “Efforts are on to convince the doctors to withdraw the strike call,” said Bajwa.Harminder Singh Mavi, state president, Panchayat Union Punjab, has come out in support of the RMOs. He said that the people living in villages were not the priority of both the state and central governments.”“While the Centre is not withdrawing the controversial farm laws despite thousands of farmers protesting at the Singhu border at the peak of the pandemic, the state government is playing a cruel joke on the people living in villages by pulling out all the doctors from rural areas and replacing them with nurses. The doctors are also being denied increments,” said Mavi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/rural-doctors-on-covid-duty-in-punjab-threaten-strike-101618660281207.html

17-04-2021||Pune||More children Covid positive in second wave||City hospitals are now witnessing an increase in the number of children turning Covid-19 positive, with severe symptoms. As reported earlier, unlike the first wave, which lasted from August to October 2020, the second wave which began in Pune from mid-February 202, is seeing more children being admitted to the hospitals with severe symptoms. The children in the family turn out to be super-spreaders, infecting senior citizens. An increased number of children are also reported ending up on a ventilator. Dr Pradeep Suryavanshi, a paediatrician at three different hospitals in the city, said, “Children are definitely acting as super spreaders. In this wave, we are seeing more children positive. At the three hospitals where I am consulting, there are at least 29 children who need intensive or critical care. We can see the impact on their brain and convulsions, which was not seen in the earlier wave. We have had three babies who tested positive for a rapid antigen test, which shows a high infection rate.” He added, “We have seen in many cases that children spread the infection to their grandparents since children are less symptomatic, but more infective, which means that children might have a simple runny nose or fever. Even neonatal babies need intensive care, which is babies aged less than a month. We will need more neonatal ICU beds and medications which are scarce now. Many hospitals have even converted their paediatric wards into adult wards, but as the cases among children increase, we may run short of beds for children.” Dr Aarti Kinikar who heads the paediatric ward in Sassoon hospital, said, “We are surely seeing more children turn out positive and even the symptoms are severe. The symptoms are also serious including cardiac symptoms like high pulse rate and also diarrhoea. Since the beginning of the pandemic we have had only four deaths among children, which was mainly among those who had birth defects or comorbidities. However, as of now at two or three children need intensive care. If any adult turns out to be positive in the family they must wear a mask, because children do not wear a mask. Even if the kids are asymptomatic they should not be allowed to mingle with the grandparents as they may be asymptomatic carriers and infect the elders who are highly vulnerable.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/more-children-covid-positive-in-second-wave-101618657160956.html

17-04-2021||Pune||Two Covid patients share one bed, some sleep on floor while getting oxygen treatment at Sassoon hospital in Pune||On Friday, a video made rounds on social media showing two Covid-19 patients wearing masks and sitting on one hospital bed, some patients with oxygen support on the stretcher and also a few lying on the floor. These visuals were from Pune’s only state-run BJ Medical College and Sassoon General Hospital (SGH). The video shows close to 30-35 Covid patients all with oxygen masks either lying on the floor, on the stretcher or on the bed which is being shared by another patient. A resident doctor on condition of anonymity said, “There were more than 30 serious Covid patients who needed a senior doctor to attend to them, but there were only two resident doctors attending to these many patients. The patients were made to stay in the casualty ward. The situation is dire. Doctors are willing to risk their lives, but we are also mentally exhausted and this load will only lead to more chaos.” Overflowing Covid patients have exhausted the medical facilities at Sassoon which is almost on the verge of collapse. The hospital management now plans to add another 300 beds, however, residents doctors have decided to protect the decision unless more staff is hired. Vijay Yadav, president of Maharashtra Association of Resident Doctors (MARD), BJMC, Pune chapter, said, “We have about 450 resident doctors at SGH and since March this year we have had about 80 doctors who have tested positive. With have a huge crunch of resident doctors since doctors are continuously getting infected. We have been raising this issue with the dean repeatedly and we have had about five meetings with him, but there have been only verbal assurances.”“Now, the management plans to increase the beds capacity from existing 500 to 800 beds. If the management decides to go ahead with increasing the beds without recruiting more doctors then we would stop all non-emergency works. As per discussion with the central MARD we will withdraw all non-Covid non-emergency services(OPD/ward work/routine lab work/routine radiology work) and all routine procedures with immediate effect for an indefinite period of time,” he said.“If our demands are not considered till Saturday 9 am, central MARD will take a stand in all over Maharashtra. All ICU, casualty, labour rooms, emergency surgery and all Covid services will continue,” he said.Despite repeated attempts to reach the dean of the hospital, Dr Murlidhar Tambe, did not respond to the queries regarding the video at the time of going to press.The hospital is also in the process to convert its non-Covid and non-emergency wards into Covid wards. The only patient from the psychiatric ward is now being out of the ward to accommodate Covid patients. A senior doctor attending the psychiatry department said, “There is only one female patient in the ward having schizophrenia who has been admitted presently. All other admissions have been denied unless extremely urgent. Although there is only one admission in the 30 bedded ward, the management is now planning to turn it into a Covid ward. The ward is now being made vacant to make room for Covid patients and because of this we are sending back non-Covid patients.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/two-covid-patients-share-one-bed-some-sleep-on-floor-while-getting-oxygen-treatment-at-sassoon-hospital-in-pune-101618656741102.html

17-04-2021||Mumbai||Sena blames Centre, EC for surge in Covid-19 cases||Maharashtra’s ruling Shiv Sena on Saturday slammed the Centre for ignoring the second Covid-19 wave while blaming it and the Election Commission (EC) for the surge in infections. In an editorial in its mouthpiece Samaana, it said the Covid situation would have been brought under control had the Centre reduced the “political dose” and focussed on the fight against the pandemic. “The Centre is not ready to tackle the corona emergency properly... China was held responsible for the first wave of coronavirus... Election Commission and Centre are responsible for the current wave. Covid spread 500 times faster from the states where elections were held or are underway... For elections and political selfishness, the rulers of Delhi created a wave of the pandemic by not tackling Covid,” the editorial said. Also read: ‘No strategy against Covid-19’ - Rahul Gandhi’s jibe against Modi govt at CWC meetThe Sena blamed election rallies in West Bengal, Assam, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Puducherry for the surge in Covid-19 cases. It also said that the coronavirus transmission also gained pace due to the Kumbh Mela. “The vehemence of Covid continues, but the election rallies and Kumbh Mela are not being stopped. Millions of devotees congregated at Kumbh; they took a dip in the Ganga and that has led to the transmission of coronavirus across the country. Prime minister [Narendra Modi] is not ready to stop the election mela in West Bengal. Then why should the saints and seers be blamed for Kumbh?” the editorial asked. “Had the Centre reduced the political dose and kept the focus on controlling the spread of coronavirus, the situation would not have gone out of hand.” The editorial asked the Centre to keep its “ego and political gains aside” to tackle the second wave.

Expressing concerns over the present scenario of Covid-19 beds in the state, state health minister, TS Singhdeo said, “We certainly have a crunch of ICU beds, we have sent a proposal to the state government to acquire another 1000 ICU beds. The occupancy rate of ICU beds is very high, close to 90% as compared to the occupancy rate of beds with oxygen facility”. “We are planning to acquire another 6000-7000 oxygen beds that would enable us to have nearly 13,000 beds combining the private and government sectors. Apart from this, we have 800 functional ventilators,” Singhdeo added. Officials of the state health department claimed that out of 5,512 beds in private hospitals in Raipur district, 3,531 are reserved for Covid-19 patients. Similarly, out of a total of 1,532 beds of private hospitals in Durg district, 972 beds have been kept for Covid-19 patients and 285 beds are reserved for Covid-19 patients in Bilaspur. Chhattisgarh has been witnessing more than 10,000 Covid-19 cases daily for the past ten days. On Thursday, the state reported the highest-single day spike with 15,256 new Covid-19 cases. The total caseload now stands at 5,01,500, a health official said. With 135 deaths due to the viral infection recorded on Friday, the statewide toll mounted to 5,442. The total number of active cases in the state stands at 1,21,769. “Positivity rate on Thursday in Chhattisgarh was 28.54%, witnessing a two% drop from the day before yesterday’s 30.63%. In the last ten days, the positivity rate has been hovering between 25-30% with a cumulative death rate of 1.091%” said Singhdeo. Chhattisgarh witnessed a total of 984 deaths in the state in the last 11 days and most of them were reported in Raipur. “In Raipur, cases of deaths are high because people from all neighbouring districts come to Raipur for Covid-19 treatment,” said an official. Raipur recorded a total of 1,431 deaths while Durg’s reported 1,054 deaths till now,” said a senior health official. Videos on social media reflected the alarming situation at mortuaries across the state. On Monday, 14 new cremation centres were opened in the capital to bury victim’s bodies.“Around 34 dead bodies are in the mortuary of state-run Ambedkar Hospital in which 17 are unclaimed. The rest are given to the family members,” said a health worker working in Ambedkar hospital, requesting anonymity. On Thursday, a video went viral in which the dead bodies were seen being ferried in a truck and garbage vans in Rajnandgaon district. “These are one-off cases. Diligent guidelines have been laid out to carry and dispose of the dead and they are being followed. Media picks up the worst-case scenario but this is not the trend,” Singhdeo said. “Even after the cremation centres are open, the bodies are cremated by sweepers and some volunteers and in some cases, the bodies are dumped in cremation centres for hours. The government should increase ambulances to ferry the dead bodies and police should be deployed for cremation,” said Subhash Ghosh, a volunteer working in cremating centres of Raipur (Rural). Meanwhile, the Chhattisgarh government said on Thursday that it has distributed another consignment of 8,800 Remdesivir injections to different hospitals amid reports of an acute shortage. “We have called in bids for 90,000 vials of Remdesivir with a provision for another 45,000 vials. We will soon have these injections,” said Singhdeo. The Chhattisgarh government on Thursday banned work stoppage in all essential services in view of the Covid-19 crisis. The order, under the Chhattisgarh Urgent Service Maintenance and Prevention of Discontinuance Act 1979, prohibits work stoppage in health facilities across all government and private medical institutions besides the sale of medicines, transport, ambulance services, supply of water and electricity, and management of food and drinking water.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/battling-shortage-of-icu-beds-chhattisgarh-health-dept-sends-proposal-to-state-govt-101618645760309.html

The most recent example is Maharana Pratap. Was he bitten by a mad dog that he left his kingdom and fort to wander in jungles?

The toll touched 59,551, while the case fatality rate stands at 1.61%.Public health minister Rajesh Tope said the state was considering tightening restrictions, while deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, too, warned Pune residents of a complete lockdown, if rules are flouted.Home minister Dilip Walse Patil also said the police force will have to strictly enforce the lockdown if people don’t pay heed.“People are flouting rules resulting in crowding at public places. A strict lockdown of 15 days is necessary. If violations continue, we will impose a stricter lockdown in the state,” said Tope. “Pune residents gave a good response to the weekend lockdown. I am hoping they will follow the rules in the upcoming days. Otherwise, as some of my fellow ministers have warned, a complete lockdown may have to be imposed. I request citizens to follow the rules and do not push the administration to take this decision. In complete lockdown, many suffered hardships,” Pawar said. “We have directed the police to restrain from using force against violators as unlike last year’s lockdown, this time we have allowed essential services. However, people are still not following the restrictions and Covid-19 protocol. In such a scenario, the police will have no option,” said Walse Patil.While the state caseload kept hovering around 60,000 cases over the past one week, the cases in Mumbai saw a slight dip after crossing the 10,000-mark thrice in the first week of the month. With 8,803 new cases on Friday, the tally stands at 562,207 and toll at 12,250, with the addition of 53 new deaths.Pune district, however, topped the chart with 11,045 cases, including 5,437 in city, 3,082 in rural parts and 2,526 in Pimpri-Chinchwad. The district also logged 47 deaths, of which 36 were in the city. The number of cases remained high in cities such as Nagpur (4,190), Nashik (2,459) and Aurangabad (775). The Mumbai Metropolitan Region clocked 17,635 cases, accounting for 27.67% of the total of the cases in the state.The number of active cases in the state rose to 638,034, while the recovery rate fell to 81.12%, as the number of recovered patients is much below the daily caseload.While the state government is struggling with shortage of liquid medical oxygen, Remdesivir injections and vaccine, the state authorities have said the supply of Remdesivir is expected to be normalised in the next few days. The state has a stock of vaccine more than 1.3 million doses, which will last for three days. The state has also started mobilising the transportation to fetch the LMO stock from other states, made available by the central government.State public health minister Rajesh Tope said, “We have been consuming the entire daily production of about 1500 metric tonnes for patients and are facing shortage in the wake of rise in the number of patients. Besides the procurement from other states, we have directed collectors to use technologies like pressure swing absorption oxygen generator and oxygen concentrators.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/state-witnesses-its-highest-one-day-spike-of-63-729-covid-cases-101618640799195.html

The state has more than 29,000 active cases at present.Leaders of opposition parties recently got worried over panchayati raj department minister Samrat Chaudhary’s statement wherein he had said that the department was ready to hold the elections, as he required spending huge budgetary allocations, amounting to ₹10,000 crore, to strengthen the rural institutions and streamline the rural water supply projects being executed under Har Ghar Nal Ka Jal scheme. “Our preparations are in the final stage and final electoral roll has been out,” said the minister.Anand Madhab, chairman of the state Congress’s manifesto committee, has urged the State Election Commission (SEC) to postpone the elections for the three-tier panchayat elections till the time the situation is brought under control. “Not only are people getting sick in large numbers due to Covid-19 this time, but casualty figures are also alarming,” said Madhab.Echoing similar views, Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) chief spokesman and MLA Bhai Birendra said, “Situation would have not been so alarming had the government learnt from the past mistakes and ramped up medical facilities.”SEC officials said they were all geared up for the elections. State election commissioner Deepak Prasad, however, could not be contacted for his comments.As per the panchayati raj department, elections for six posts in each of over 8,400 panchayat bodies are scheduled for June.

All police stations’ in-charges and senior officers are regularly interacting with them virtually and listening to their issues and also taking suggestions for effective implementation of the restrictions.Nagrale warned people against spreading rumours and fake news about the Covid through social media. “Such elements would see stricter action,” Nagrale said.Last year, hundreds of migrants gathered outside Bandra stations following rumours about special trains being arranged to send them home.

17-04-2021||Patna||As Covid-19 cases surge, Bihar hospitals report oxygen shortage||Hospitals in Bihar have been reporting a shortage of oxygen amid an increase in demand for it with a surge in Covid-19 cases.Authorities at Patna’s Sahyog Hospital said the demand has doubled from 20 cylinders to 40 per day. The hospital has been unable to admit Covid-19 patients who require oxygen up to 12-15 litres per minute, said an official.Principal secretary (health) Pratyaya Amrit acknowledged the shortage over the last two days and said efforts were on to streamline the supply. “We have asked two major suppliers, Linde India and Inox Air Products Ltd, to supply medical oxygen on a daily basis instead of alternate days as is the case now,” he said.“Two oxygen generation plants, with a capacity of 250 litres oxygen per minute, are operational at the Patna Medical College Hospital and the Nalanda Medical College Hospital while those at seven other state-run medical college hospitals will be functional in a week or 10 days,” said Amrit.Bihar relies mostly on West Bengal and Jharkhand for the supply of medical oxygen.Rambabu, an operator at an oxygen production and refilling firm, said the demand for small cylinders had gone up by 10 times and for big by three to five times. “Earlier, we used to supply 50 to 60 big cylinders every day. Now, we have to supply 180-200 cylinders daily,” he said.Another supplier, Suresh Kumar, said his agency would receive a demand of 23 to 25 small cylinders, which has now gone up to 35 to 45 daily.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/as-covid-19-cases-surge-bihar-hospitals-report-oxygen-shortage-101618635139736.html
17-04-2021||Other||BJP loses control of municipal council in heart of Goa CM’s constituency||In a blow to Goa chief minister Pramod Sawant, the BJP-backed chairperson of the Sankhali municipal council, a constituency that the chief minister represents in the state assembly, was ousted in a no-confidence motion on Friday. “The chief minister is behind all these tactics to ensure that they retain the chair of the council. They want to send a message that if you stand against them, they will do everything possible to harass you. What message are they sending to those who want to enter politics next,” Dharmesh Saglani, a Congressman who leads the opposition group said. Sitting chairperson Yeshwant Madkar and his group of councillors remained absent during the meeting which was called to vote on the no-confidence motion resulting in a victory for the opposition. Congress won the vote 7-0 in the 13-member council. The victory caps a flurry of developments in which the state machinery attempted to stymie the holding of the vote. It first repeatedly postponed the date of the meeting, filed a disqualification petition against an opposition councillor in a bid to get him disqualified before the vote and when he obtained a stay from the High Court, it filed a disqualification petition against another councillor who also got the stay from the HC. Another councillor was prevented from voting by issuing an arrest warrant but that attempt too failed as the councillor got anticipatory bail. North Goa’s Sanquelim town forms a crucial part of the constituency that CM Sawant represents. He is a two-term MLA from here. The BJP held a narrow majority in the council but all that changed when Damodar Ghadi, a councillor belonging to the BJP camp, passed away in November last year. Elections were held on March 20 to fill up the vacant seat in which the candidate backed by Sawant lost. However, anticipating a victory, two days before voting was held, the opposition councillors moved a no-confidence motion against incumbent Yashwant Madkar. However, rather than quickly calling for a meeting of the council to decide the motion, the Director of Municipal Administration called for the meeting to be held only on April 30 - six weeks after the motion was tabled forcing the opposition councillors to approach the Bombay High Court at Goa. “The removal of an elected office bearer on the loss of confidence is an essential feature of democracy. Such a feature cannot be defeated by the Director by simply delaying the holding of a meeting to even consider such a motion,” the High Court said while directing that the meeting be held on April 16.Faced with the possibility of losing control of the council, a disqualification petition against one of the opposition councillors, Rajesh Sawal, that was kept for hearing before the minister of urban development, Milind Naik, on April 28 was moved forward to April 14. Sawal promptly approached the High Court alleging that “from the sequence of events, it is apparent that the entire objective behind such a preponement is to disqualify [him] or disable [him] from taking part in the meeting to consider the motion of no confidence.”The High Court granted a “stay on further proceedings for disqualification of the petitioner.”While attempts to disqualify Sawal failed, late on Thursday evening, the urban development minister issued another councillor, Raya Parsekar, to be present for a hearing at a time that would clash with the meeting for the motion of no confidence. The councillor too approached the High Court and obtained a stay. Unable to prove their majority or ensure that the opposition candidates would not win the motion, the BJP backed-councillors abstained from attending the meeting allowing the opposition to win the motion 7-0. “After the High Court rescued democracy in Goa, [a] humiliating 7-0 defeat of the BJP backed Sanquelim Municipal Council Chairperson Yeshwant Madkar is a clear signal that the end of BJP government is near. Congratulations to all seven councillors of Sanquelim who remained strong and united,” Leader of Opposition Digambar Kamat tweeted. “The BJP government is all out to finish the democracy in the country and has already adopted dictatorial governance. Dr. Pramod Sawant is completely shaken with his lost control of Sankhali Municipality which falls in his own constituency,” state Congress president Girish Chodankar said.“This is not the last we will hear of it. The state will continue to file cases against us which we will have to face,” Saglani said.Naik remained unreachable for a comment despite repeated attempts to get in touch with him.State BJP president Sadanand Shet Tanavade sought to play down the implications of the defeat. “These things keep happening as a consequence of local politics. As a party president it would not be appropriate for me to offer my comments,” Tanavade said. Independent political observer Advocate Cleofato Almeida Coutinho said that Goa is fortunate that the courts intervened to allow the no-confidence motion to go ahead. “It was because of the intervention of the High Court that is sensitive to the principles of democracy that the principle of democracy was upheld. We should not take this for granted. All parties try to take advantage of the grey areas in the laws to their advantage and no party is interested in streamlining the processes,” Coutinho said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bjp-loses-control-of-municipal-council-in-heart-of-cm-sawant-s-constituency-101618634839033.html

The entire operation was a combined success of human intelligence as well as technical intelligence. We thought we had almost lost him,” Bhubaneswar-Cuttack commissioner of police Soumendra Priyadarshi said.The Odisha police on Friday produced the gangster before a court in Cuttack which granted it 7 days remand for further interrogation in his case of escape. The gangster, convicted in two murder cases, also faces trial in about a dozen other cases of extortion.Last Saturday, Hyder, who is serving a life sentence in a case of murder of a businessman, had fled from his cabin at the surgery ward of Sriram Chandra Bhanja (SCB) Medical College and Hospital in Cuttack after intoxicating the lone security guard on duty. The gangster was brought from Sambalpur circle jail for hydrocele surgery 18 days prior to that but used the opportunity to flee.On Saturday afternoon, a nurse at the hospital who was supposed to give a jab to the gangster first reported his disappearance. The lone armed sentry sent by the Sambalpur police to guard him was found intoxicated and disoriented. “When I arrived at the bed at 5.30 pm, I found the sentry sleeping. Hyder was not there on his bed,” said the nurse.Though initially it was suspected that the lone sentry was fed biryani spiked with some intoxicants, senior officials said the policeman may have been given water or some drink spiked with drugs. However, they admitted that there was clear laxity in the handling of the gangster’s security.Priyadarshi said Hyder was travelling on a bike in Sangareddy district on Thursday evening when the motorcycle-bound police team of Cuttack district, with the help of Telangana police, intercepted him.Senior police officials said some doctors in VIMSAR Burla as well as SCB Medical College appeared to have given exaggerated reports about the gangster’s ailments though he suffered just from hydrocele. While there were reports that he was to be operated on his gallbladder, there are contradictory reports of him having different health issues. “The role of doctors in the entire episode needs to probed,” said an official.People privy to the development said Hyder’s escape from the hospital was a result of a well-planned criminal conspiracy hatched by around 10 persons including his two sons- Azharuddin and Chuni. Yakub, one of his aides, spilt the beans about Hyder after his arrest. During the investigation, police suspected that he had moved either to Andhra Pradesh or Telangana.“During the probe, we almost zeroed down that Haider had moved to Telangana via Andhra by road. Based on information from the technical surveillance team under the supervision of Cuttack DCP, we tried to track his locations and with help of Hyderabad and Telangana police teams, we kept a close vigil on his movement. Based on police inputs about his presence at a particular place in Sangareddy district, we intercepted Haider who was riding a motorcycle. The team led by Badambadi IIC caught him on the way at around 6.00 pm on Thursday,” Priyadarshi told at the press meet.Though it is difficult to imagine the portly Hyder as a gangster, he was a renowned name in Odisha’s underworld in the late 90s due to his ability to execute crimes. In the 1980s, Hyder was earning a living by pulling a rickshaw in Kendrapara town and later worked as a truck driver. Police officials in Kendrapara say, Hyder soon got involved in petty thefts and formed a gang with two other criminals Syed Usman Ali alias Tito and Suleiman.“They sometimes worked as a gang, but also fell out with each other over small issues. Their main business was extortion, felony and tender fixing. They were often hired by contractors who did not wish rivals to get the contract for a particular civil work,” said a police officer in Kendrapara. In 2005, he became a known name in the underworld after killing Sk Chuna, brother of his friend-turned-foe Suleiman. He was arrested from Nagpur for the murder and was awarded life imprisonment in 2011. However, he got out on parole and with the help of Tito, he got Suleiman, the most educated among the three, shot dead on a road in 2012. Hyder and Tito however soon fell out and bayed for each other’s blood.Hyder was again arrested and later sentenced to life in 2015 over kidnapping and murder of mines trader Rashmi Ranjan Mahapatra. Though he was in jail, police officials said he was known to plan and execute crimes from inside the jail.In June 2017, Tito was arrested by the Crime Branch Special Task Force (STF) and since then has been living in solitary confinement.Former state DGP and BJP leader Prakash Mishra who has seen the rise of Hyder and his criminal gang over the years said that the escape of the gangster could not have been possible without the active collusion of police, jail and hospital officials. “Was the gangster’s escape planned in a manner to allow him enough time to slip past highway check gates before police issued emergency lookout orders? Some influential powers are surely behind the conspiracy,” he alleged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/odisha-criminal-who-fled-hospital-finally-arrested-in-telangana-101618632079617.html

PM Modi in a tweet said, “There are by-polls taking place in different parts of the country. I urge voters in the seats polling today to vote in record numbers and strengthen the festival of democracy.”The elections to the Belgaum Lok Sabha constituency were necessitated following the death of Union minister Suresh Angadi due to coronavirus disease (Covid-19) last year. Basavakalyan is holding a by-poll due to the death of MLA B Narayan Rao due to Covid-19. Bypolls to Maski assembly constituency is being held due to the disqualification of MLA Prathapagouda, who shifted to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) after winning on a Congress ticket in 2018.The Congress has tried to corner the ruling BJP over lack of good administration, Karnataka’s Covid-19 situation, issues related to reservation of different communities and allegations of a sex scandal against one of Karnataka’s cabinet ministers R Jarkiholi. Congress won the Basavakalyan and Maski assembly constituencies in 2018 and hopes to retain it in this by-polls.Congress has fielded Satish Jarkiholi, the MLA from the Yamkanmaradi assembly constituency, against the BJP’s Mangala Suresh Angadi, wife of late Suresh Angadi for the Belgaum Lok Sabha seat.In Basavakalyan, Congress has fielded Mallamma, the wife of late legislator B Narayan Rao, against the BJP’s youth leader Sharanu Salagar. Mallikarjun Khuba, a rebel leader formerly of the BJP, who is contesting as an Independent candidate is also in the fray. Janata Dal (Secular) which has limited itself to the Basavakalyan assembly constituency in this by-polls has fielded Syed Yasrab Ali Quadri.The BJP has nominated Prathapagouda Patil in Maski, who emerged winner in 2018 against Congress’ Basanagouda Turvihal.

17-04-2021||Delhi||14kg heroin, worth ₹98 crore, seized in massive drug haul at IGI Airport||Customs officers at Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International airport on Wednesday arrested two people from Zambia, and recovered 14kg heroin estimated to be worth ₹98 crore that they were allegedly trying to smuggle into the country.Senior customs officers privy to the operation said this was one of the biggest seizures in recent years, and added that they were probing the role of a “large syndicate” in the operation.The officers said they had a tip-off, and the two passengers, a man and a woman, who arrived in Delhi in a Qatar Airways flight from Johannesburg via Doha early on Wednesday, were intercepted as soon as they crossed the Green Channel (nothing to declare) at Terminal 3.“Initially, they denied if they were carrying anything objectionable. They were then screened through a door frame metal detector (DFMD) which did not detect anything prohibited. Their bags were checked through an X-ray scanner, and some suspicious items were spotted. When the bags were opened, two packets, each about 7kg containing a white powder, were recovered from their bags,” said a senior customs officer who asked not to be named.“A drug detection kit confirmed that the seized substance was heroin. They told us that they were couriers who were asked to transport the drugs and hand them over to someone in Delhi,” the officer added.A second officer aware of the matter said they are investigating the source of the drugs, and the person to whom the packages were to be delivered. “It is one of the biggest drug hauls at Delhi airport. Role of a bigger syndicate behind the attempted smuggling cannot be ruled out. We are looking at the past involvement of the two persons,” the officer cited above.Shaukat Ali Nurvi, joint commissioner of Customs (Delhi airport), put the estimated value of the recovered drugs at ₹98 crore.“During questioning, the two have admitted to smuggling narcotics. The recovered goods were seized under relevant sections, and both the passengers have been arrested. Further investigation in the matter is under progress,” Nurvi said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/14kg-heroin-worth-98-crore-seized-in-massive-drug-haul-at-igi-airport-101618617695477.html
17-04-2021||Delhi||Passes for night curfew applicable over weekend||Hours before the weekend curfew was to come into effect at 10pm on Friday, the government and police issued orders directing district administrations to ensure strict enforcement of restrictions over the next two days.The government directed bus conductors to ensure that public buses are accessible to all essential service providers with valid identity cards and e-passes, while exempting from the curfew candidates who are scheduled to appear for examinations on Saturday and Sunday. Such candidates need only carry their admit cards, the government said.Spelling relief to essential service providers, the government on Friday clarified that e-passes issued for movement during the ongoing night curfew would suffice for travel during the weekend curfew.The Delhi Police asserted that extensive arrangements -- pickets, patrolling on bikes and in four-wheelers, and maximum deployment of personnel on streets -- are being made.“When they did not do so till late-afternoon, a few of us went to the SDM’s office and learnt that the night pass would suffice,” said Jagan Mahapatra, a grocery store owner who also supplies bottled water and milk cartons in and around south Delhi’s Khirki Extension locality.On Friday, district administration and police sent out teams across the city and chaired meetings with residents and market welfare groups, seeking their help in ensuring full compliance of curfew regulations.“Same as last year, the Delhi Police is again at the frontline to arrest the surge of Covid-19,” city police commissioner SN Shrivastava said in a virtual meeting with senior officers, including all DCPs on Friday afternoon, directing them to maintain tight vigil and prosecute anyone found wilfully disobeying the restrictions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/passes-for-night-curfew-applicable-over-weekend-101618617492838.html
17-04-2021||Delhi||Residents stock up on essentials ahead of curfew||With the Delhi government announcing a weekend curfew from 10pm on Friday to 5am on Monday, several residents rushed to departmental stores in their neighbourhoods and stocked up on essentials, worried that a full lockdown may be in store.There were serpentine queues outside several departmental stores in the city on Friday.Bags of rice and atta, cartons of packaged milk, packets of salt and sugar, ready-to-eat noodles, toothpaste and mosquito repellents were among the wide range of products that residents bought from a departmental store in Malviya Nagar.“It is better to replenish our stock of day-to-day goods and groceries. You never know what happens after this weekend,” said Pawan Thakur, a 66-year-old resident of the south Delhi colony.The government’s decision to impose a curfew this weekend in the light of the surge in Covid-19 cases in the Capital has sparked fears of a lockdown.While shops selling essential goods are exempted in the weekend curfew, and are most likely to remain out of the ambit of stringent restrictions, residents fear several products may go out of stock in the coming days.“It is better to buy things now. Covid-19 cases are increasing every day. The weekend curfew may turn into a full-fledged lockdown for a week or so, you never know,” said Ashok Randhawa, a resident of Kalkaji K-block, who went to a departmental store on Friday to get his stock of household essentials refilled.In the last few days, several resident welfare associations (RWA) in the city have been circulating messages on WhatsApp urging members to refill their stock of essentials at one go, preferably, so that they don’t have to step out frequently.“We have also stressed in such groups that when people go out to run errands, there is a likelihood of shops getting crowded within a short span of time. So, people must maintain social distancing and go for staggered timings by coordinating with other residents in the group,” said Saurabh Gandhi, general secretary of United Residents of Delhi, which is a collective of around 1,800 RWAs in the city.As a large number of people across the city stepped out to buy essentials on Friday, staffers at several departmental stores urged customers to maintain distancing and stand in queues, while screening everyone entering their premises — practices that many stores gave up after new cases dropped in February.Several vendors in prominent vegetable and spice markets were spotted requesting people to maintain distance fearing that failure to adhere to rules could potentially mean a lockdown in the coming days.“Things are scary now. Every second person is getting infected. But a lockdown would be like a major setback in such bad times. We will take all preventive steps to make sure that such a situation does not arise,” said Brijesh Mehta, owner of a prominent wholesale vegetable shop in east Delhi’s Mayur Vihar-I, which witnessed relatively high footfall on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/residents-stock-up-on-essentials-ahead-of-curfew-101618617225486.html

17-04-2021||Delhi||Dust storm, rain bring down mercury in Capital||A dust storm and light rain hit parts of Delhi-NCR, bringing down the temperature and affecting visibility in some areas, officials from India Meteorological Department (IMD) said. Officials also forecast light rain on Saturday, which they said will bring down the temperature by two to three degrees.Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre, said that the sudden thunderstorm and light rain on Friday was the result of a western disturbance.“Strong winds with speed up to 70-80 kmph prevailed today (Friday)... light rain was also reported from some places. The weather activity on account of the western disturbance will reduce and only cloudiness is expected on Saturday,” said Srivastava.A western disturbance is a storm originating in the Mediterranean region that brings sudden rain to the northern parts of the Indian subcontinent.According to IMD data, the minimum temperature in Delhi on Friday was recorded at 20.2 degree Celsius – two degrees below normal – and the maximum temperature was around 40 degree Celsius – three degrees above normal.The weekly IMD forecast says it may rain in Delhi on Saturday as well.“The dust storm in Delhi was mainly due to local convective activity associated with a western disturbance that impacted the western Himalayan region. PM 10 (coarse particulate matter) concentrations have increased significantly following dust raising winds in the region. But our models are showing PM 10 levels will come back to the moderate category by night,” said Vijay Soni, a scientist at IMD’s air quality division, referring to the dust pollution caused by the strong winds.Delhi’s air quality remained in the ‘poor’ category on Friday, with data from Central Pollution Control Board showing that the 24-hour air quality index (AQI) stood at 238. The Union ministry of earth science’s air quality monitoring centre, System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar), said the air quality will improve over the weekend.“The overall Delhi air quality has deteriorated marginally to the ’poor’ category as forecasted. PM10 (dust) remain the prominent pollutant. High dust is likely at isolated places today (Friday) due to gusty winds and thunderstorms. Likely rainfall will improve AQI from poor to moderate category in the next two days,” stated the Safar bulletin.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/dust-storm-rain-bring-down-mercury-in-capital-101618616699290.html
17-04-2021||Delhi||141 more lives lost to Covid-19: Toll hits peak as new cases near 20,000||On Friday, 141 people died of the coronavirus disease in the national capital, the most fatalities in one day in the city so far.The fourth wave of the infection that has stormed the Capital over the past few weeks has been the most devastating so far, with infections and deaths soaring to levels not seen at any stage since the outbreak of the pandemic. Before Friday’s fatalities hit a record, the most deaths logged in a day were on November 18, when the infection claimed 131 lives.Cases, meanwhile, have increased at an alarming rate in the Capital. Delhi hit another one-day infection record on Friday, with the city adding 19,486 cases, and the infection tally crossing the 800,000 mark.Delhi has added the last 100,000 cases in eight days. In comparison, the previous 100,000 cases were registered over 120 days.“The absolute number of deaths is expected to go up further, with cases continuing to rise. The curve of deaths usually follows that of the number of cases by five to 10 days. The proportion of deaths might also go up as the health care system gets stretched thin with the sheer number of cases – people might not reach hospital on time, might not get a bed in time, and might not receive required treatment in time,” said Dr Jugal Kishore, head of the department of community medicine at Safdarjung hospital.“When the numbers of cases and deaths were low in January and February, the case fatality rate (proportion of deaths among those who test positive) reduced to less than 0.5%. It may go up again now, but I believe it will still likely stay between 1% and 1.5%,” said Dr Kishore.The city’s cumulative case fatality rate currently stands at 1.47%.The positivity rate – proportion of samples that test positive – dipped marginally to 19.69% from the previous day’s 20.22% with the number of tests increasing to 98,957 from Thursday’s 82,569.The test positivity rate is far higher than the World Health Organization’s recommendation of below 5%.Delhi’s positivity rate was below 1% for 82 days, till it crossed that mark on March 20.The surge in cases in Delhi has consequently led to an increase in the number of hospitalisations, with over 12,000 beds occupied for the first time in the city. Patients have been forced to run from pillar to post in search of beds.Meanwhile, ministers and state government officials held review meetings throughout the day. Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain visited Guru Teg Bahadur (GTB) hospital and Rajiv Gandhi hospital on Friday to review the management of cases.“Met with the patients, doctors & staff. Reviewed the hospital’s management system. In these hard times, Delhi Govt. is taking swift & efficient steps to defeat the Coronavirus,” Jain tweeted.In a review meeting, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Friday asked state health department officials to scale up the number of oxygen beds reserved for Covid-19 patients.The state government also ordered all government and private laboratories to be linked with each district to ensure that all Covid-19 samples get processed within the stipulated period, amid reports of testing delays in the Capital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/141-more-lives-lost-to-covid-19-toll-hits-peak-as-new-cases-near-20000-101618616012758.html

17-04-2021||Delhi||City to get more oxygen beds for Covid-19||Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, after a review meeting on Friday, directed officials to add more Covid-19 beds with oxygen supply, ensure real-time updates on the availability of beds on the Delhi Corona portal, and scale up tele-consultancy and patient care services for those in home isolation.The chief minister also said hospitals must have multiple assistance numbers with a nodal officer for each number to make sure that no distress call is missed or turned down, said the government in a press statement.The statement came after Kejriwal chaired a review meeting on the Covid-19 situation and health care infrastructure in the city with state health minister Satyendar Jain and senior government officials at the Delhi secretariat earlier in the day.“Several steps taken by the Delhi government to improve the health infrastructure of Delhi were discussed, along with increasing the bed capacity and several other infrastructure requirements in Delhi. CM Arvind Kejriwal directed officials to create more Covid facilities and to increase the strength of oxygen beds across Delhi. He also directed officials to update real-time availability of beds on the Delhi Corona app and ensure that the information on the number of beds is exact,” the statement read.As on 6pm Friday, hospitals across the national capital had 16,483 Covid-19 beds, of which 12,211 were occupied, according to the government app.Worryingly, however, 3,545 of the 3,989 ICU beds reserved for Covid-19 patients were occupied, showed the app.The government statement also read, “He (the CM) said there should be multiple assistance numbers for each hospital and nodal persons should be appointed for all helpline numbers... He also said the health teams must reach out to every patient in home isolation and provide oximeters; the general public should receive every assistance while in home isolation.”“The focus of the Delhi government is on increasing bed capacity, which will ensure adequate treatment for people who need urgent assistance. In the meeting, bed management was discussed in detail,” said the statement.The directions came amid a large number of complaints from the public that hospitals were refusing beds to patients even though the government’s mobile app showed that there were vacant beds in those hospitals.The chief minister asked officials to ensure that hospital helpline numbers, which are also mentioned on the Delhi Corona app, should be operational.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/city-to-get-more-oxygen-beds-for-covid19-101618615532354.html
17-04-2021||Delhi||Patients run from pillar to post as city hospitals packed to the rafters||With the number of daily infections nearing the 20,000 mark, Delhi is facing an acute crisis of hospital beds, with several health care facilities, including dedicated Covid facilities, now turning patients away for lack of space, a Hindustan Times spot check on Friday showed.Covid-19 hospitalisations crossed the 10,000-mark for the first time on Thursday. As on Friday evening, of the total 16,426 beds, 12,087 were occupied. Of the total 3,976 ICU beds, 3,501 were occupied, according to the Delhi Corona app at 5pm.With beds running out fast, people are increasingly taking to social media to seek help with finding space in hospitals.On Friday evening, when HT called 11 big hospitals – both government and private -- three times each to check for the availability of beds, most of the calls went unanswered. Only four of the 33 calls were answered with all of them replying -- “no beds available at the moment”.Safdarjung hospital was the only one among the six government hospitals contacted that answered the call. The person on the other end said: “There are no beds available. We are not making any waiting lists; we just do not have any beds.” According to the government app, the hospital had no ICU beds and 79 ward beds available at the time.Only three private hospitals answered the call — Max Hospital in Saket, Fortis in Vasant Kunj, and Sir Ganga Ram hospital. Telephone operators at both Max and Fortis hospitals said that there were no beds available, and disconnected before any other further inquiry could be made.There were just two beds and no ICU beds available at Max Saketm and no ward or ICU beds available at Fortis-Vasant Kunj, according to the Corona app.At Sir Ganga Ram hospital, the operator said, “We do not have any ICU beds. The ward beds might become available as we discharge more non-Covid patients.” On enquiring when the bed might become available, HT was told that it will happen next morning when the next lot of patients are discharged.According to the Corona app, there were six ward beds and two ICU beds available in Ganga Ram hospital at the time.It was not immediately clear how quickly the app is updated by hospital staff to reflect the actual situation.Managements of Max hospitals and Sir Ganga Ram refused to comment. A representative for Fortis could not be reached.A doctor from one of the private hospitals, on condition of anonymity said, “We do not have beds, what can we do. We have to turn away patients. We do not even know where to refer them to; it is not like there are hospitals in the city that have free beds.”In a meeting with senior health officials on Friday, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal directed that the helpline numbers on the Delhi Corona app remain functional round-the-clock, according to a government release. “There should be multiple assistance numbers in the hospitals and nodal persons should be appointed at every helpline number. No urgent calls should be missed and turned down,” Kejriwal said.At the meeting, the CM also directed officials to ensure that hospital’s update information on beds availability regularly on the state government’s Delhi Corona portal.Dr Suresh Kumar, medical director of Lok Nayak hospital on Friday evening said, “We have 700 ward beds and 150 ICU beds. The situation is still manageable; the hospital was completely full in November. But more beds will become full with increase in the number of fresh cases.” As per the figures provided by him, only two of the available ICU beds had ventilator with the rest only providing oxygen support to the patients.As per the Delhi government app, there were 739 ward beds and only 12 ICU beds available in the hospital at the time.A doctor who works in the hospital ICU said, “The number of patients that we are receiving currently is two to three times of what we had seen in November. The hospital is already full.”Another doctor at Lok Nayak hospital said, “We have 1,500 beds. However, there is no infrastructure support, machines, and staff to run several of these beds. In addition, many of the healthcare workers in the hospital have started testing positive again. So, we cannot admit as many patients.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/patients-run-from-pillar-to-post-as-city-hospitals-packed-to-the-rafters-101618614284722.html
17-04-2021||Delhi||Funeral homes struggle to keep up with rising deaths||The surge in Covid-19 cases in the Capital has not only burdened the city’s medical infrastructure and health care workers but also stretched thin Delhi’s crematoriums and burial grounds, which are now struggling to dispose of bodies with limited resources and staff.On Friday, Delhi reported 141 deaths, the city’s highest single-day fatality count since the pandemic began.The most deaths before this were reported on November 18 last year, when 131 died of the infection. The city has reported 597 fatalities from the infection in the last seven days, compared to 174 deaths in all of February and March.“On Thursday, we received 12 dead bodies, while there were two more from the previous day. Of these, eight were sent for cremation, but they refused one body. After we intervened personally, the crematorium agreed to take the body but said it would take time. There were six dead bodies with us and three more came on Friday morning. Out of the nine bodies, four were handed over to the families while the remaining five are still at the hospital,” said a doctor from the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) during a review by Union health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan.Another doctor from AIIMS recounted that in one hospital, 17 out of the 20 beds in a ward are lying vacant as three bodies are waiting to be disposed of and no patient can be admitted in the ward before the bodies are disposed.The doctor also requested that the crematorium in Green Park be allowed to take bodies of Covid-19 patients to ease the situation. The bodies of the Covid-19 patients are handed over to the families in a leak-proof plastic bag that is sanitised with 1% hypochlorite solution to ensure the infection does not spread.The AIIMS has also instituted a mechanism for relatives to identify the dead and give a written undertaking on whether they want to take the bodies for funeral themselves or let the hospital do it. This comes after there was a mix-up last year where the body of a Muslim patient was cremated before the family realised the error.At Lok Nayak hospital, a mortuary technician said 40 dead bodies were sent for disposal on Thursday. “Sometimes, there is a delay in getting a Covid-19 test report or finding a mode of transport. The crematoria do not accept bodies after 6pm, as a result of which they have to be kept in the mortuary. However, the bodies are disposed of in the morning within a couple of hours.”The problem of transportation and adequate staff to pack the bodies delayed the process of handing over bodies at Rajeev Gandhi Superspeciality Hospital. “There are just a couple of people who handle the dead bodies and take them to the crematorium or burial ground. Sometimes, there is a delay because the ambulance allocated for carrying the dead body is already at the disposal site,” said a doctor from the hospital on the condition of anonymity.Six hospitals are attached with the Nigambodh Ghat--one of the biggest crematoriums in the city for Covid-related funerals. Suman Gupta, the general secretary of Badi Panchayat Vaishya Beese Agarwal organisation that manages the city’s main crematorium at the ghat, said around 120 bodies were cremated on Thursday, which is the highest number of cremations so far this year. “From zero Covid-related cremations on April 1, the number of cremations has now reached to around 50 per day,” said Gupta.Around 38 of the 120 platforms in the crematorium have been set aside for people who have died of Covid-19, said Gupta adding that they can cremate maximum 135 bodies per day. “If the number of fatalities rises, we may have to figure out a way to increase the number of cremations using the existing resources,” he said adding that around 70 workers do a 12-hour shift to keep the crematorium running.Officials at the Seemapuri crematorium, which is attached to Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital and Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality Hospital, said they have also witnessed an increase in the number of cremations. Hemant Sharma, a priest at the crematorium, said sometimes, staff have to work 14-hour shifts because of the huge pile up of bodies.“The workers come at 5am and start putting the wood on the pyre so that people don’t have to wait. From two to three bodies, we are now cremating around 35 bodies per day. Earlier, we would take time but now, we have to ensure that the cremation is wrapped in less than 30 minutes so that there is no backlog. The number of bodies arriving here for cremation is more than what we saw in November,” said Sharma.Burial grounds across the city are being plagued with similar problems. With more bodies arriving at the burial ground, officials of the ITO graveyard--one of the largest burial grounds in Delhi--have brought in earth movers to dig several graves. “It has become impossible to dig graves manually. We were getting around 9-12 bodies during the third wave of the virus around October- November. The numbers have increased now,” said Mohammad Shamim, supervisor at the ITO burial ground.Meanwhile, authorities at the three civic bodies said that there were 21 facilities (crematoria and graveyards) where funerals of Covid-19 patients (confirmed and suspected both) were being carried. The facilities can collectively dispose around 400 bodies per day, said civic officials.Jai Prakash, mayor of North Delhi Municipal Corporation, said so far, there are enough resources at the cremation and burial grounds to dispose of the bodies of Covid-19 patients.“At Nigambodh Ghat, that shares the maximum load of dead bodies in the city, we have increased the number of platforms for cremation through wooden pyre from 104 to 120. Similarly, we have also inaugurated three more CNG furnaces there, bringing the total number to six. We have also written to the Delhi government to make arrangements for alternative burial sites, in case the graveyards outrun their capacity,” said Prakash.Leader of the house in South Delhi Municipal Corporation , Narendra Chawla, said there are eight facilities dedicated to Covid-19 related funerals.“We have a capacity to conduct around 200 funerals per day. Wooden pyre platforms have been increased at cremation grounds, including at the Punjabi Bagh. In February, we inaugurated a CNG crematorium in Green Park that can be used for cremating Covid-19 patients if and when the need arises,” he said.A senior official of the East Delhi Municipal Corporation said there are three cremation grounds and two graveyards in the jurisdiction of east corporation. The cumulative capacity of these facilities is above 40 per day. “ As of now, we are receiving only 20-30 bodies per day,” said the official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/funeral-homes-struggle-to-keep-up-with-rising-deaths-101618613880947.html
17-04-2021||Chandigarh||DSGMC poll campaign picks up pace; Akali Dal, 2 splinter groups in the fray||The campaign for the upcoming Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (DSGMC) elections has picked up momentum in the national capital. The Badals-led Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) and its two splinter groups — SAD (Delhi) and Jago Party — are the main contenders for the polls scheduled to be held on April 25. The results will be declared two days later. Besides, the Panthic Sewa Dal, seen as a non-entity, is also in the fray. The gurdwara body with an annual budget of ₹110 crore directly manages 10 historical gurdwaras and has an indirect control over 8 gurdwaras run by the Singh Sabhas. Besides, it runs a number of schools, colleges, industrial training institutes and hospitals that are headed by its elected members for a period of 4 years. Delhi has a Sikh population of more than 10 lakh. Currently, the Badals-led Shiromani Akali Dal controls the management of gurdwara body. Manjinder Singh Sirsa, the outgoing president, is the party’s contender for the top post. “We appeal to more and more Sikhs to vote in the polls. They should vote for the right candidates as the contest is for the management of gurdwaras,” said former National Minorities’ Commission chairman Tarlochan Singh, who also remained a Rajya Sabha member. Manjit Singh GK, who resigned from the post of president two years ago, fell out with the SAD leadership and formed the Jago Party. The then president of the SAD’s Delhi unit is a strong contender for the president’s position. Also, former DSGMC chiefs — Paramjit Singh Sarna and his brother Harvinder Singh Sarna of the SAD (Delhi) — are also in the fray for the post. The Panthic Sewa Dal, which is contesting from 25 seats, drew a blank in the last polls in 2017 when it had the support of the ruling Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) which has stayed away from the polls this time. “There are a total of 3.45 lakh votes with average 7,500 votes in each ward. The contenders will have to count on every single vote,” said Jaspal Singh, former Punjabi University vice chancellor who also remained associated with the DSGMC for a long time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/dsgmc-poll-campaign-picks-up-pace-akali-dal-2-splinter-groups-in-the-fray-101618605917267.html
17-04-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab IG Kunwar Vijay Pratap set to don lawyer’s robes||Inspector general of police (IGP) Kunwar Vijay Pratap Singh, who resigned from service in the wake of the Punjab and Haryana High Court quashing the special investigation team (SIT)’s report on the Kotkapura firing case, wants to start a new innings as a lawyer. “If needed, I will continue to assist the Punjab government in the sacrilege case — not as an IPS officer, but a lawyer. I will defend the case,” the police officer said in an interview to a Canadian radio channel on Thursday.Even as the state government has rejected his resignation, Kunwar Vijay is firm on his decision to quit. Not only this, he has also approached the Bar Council of Punjab and Haryana and High Court to get a licence for practicing law. He completed his bachelor in laws (LLB) from Panjab University in 2010.“Though a formal application was not received, Kunwar Vijay had phoned the Bar Council president to enquire about getting a licence. The licence would be issued once the council gets his file with no-objection certificate (NOC) from the employer. He can join legal profession once his resignation is accepted,” said Rakesh Gupta, a member of the Bar Council governing council. Earlier, Kunwar Vijay had said he will “continue to serve society in other ways”.“I am a law graduate and university topper. I have to take up a profession, and I will go for legal practice,” he told the radio channel. That justice delayed is justice denied, the IGP said he had a grim hope of an outcome in the police firing cases as five years have already lapsed. The officer used to draft all legal documents and even vet files of sensitive cases. He is also learnt to have draft replies of all writ petitions himself.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-ig-kunwar-vijay-pratap-set-to-don-lawyer-s-robes-101618605860300.html
17-04-2021||Chandigarh||CM Amarinder has agreed to my decision to step down: IG Kunwar Vijay||Inspector general of police (IGP) Kunwar Vijay Pratap Singh, whose application for voluntary retirement from service has started a political slugfest in Punjab, on Friday said chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh has agreed to his decision to step down. “I was called on by the CM a few times to convince me to take back my application. I managed to convince him and he agreed to my plea,” said the IPS officer while talking to mediapersons after meeting Punjab governor VP Singh Badnore. “I have assured the CM that if the state government needs my help in its efforts in the sacrilege cases, I will be available anytime,” said the 1998-batch IPS officer, who put in his papers on April 11, two days after the Punjab and Haryana High Court quashed the report of the special investigation team (SIT) in the Kotkapura police firing case. The high court had also directed the state government to constitute a new SIT without having the IG on board to probe the cases. The CM had issued a statement rejecting the officer’s plea, saying the border needed a “competent officer” him. Application not sent to MHA yet The Punjab government has not forwarded the officer’s application to the Union ministry of home affairs (MHA) yet, senior home department official said. In the application, Kunwar Vijay has sought waiving three-month notice period and has requested to relieve him from April 15. On his visiting the governor’s residence in Chandigarh, he said, “I meet him (governor) every month in personal capacity.” He said those demanding to make the findings of the SIT (headed by him) public “lack knowledge”.“The SIT has already submitted its findings in form of challans submitted in the trial court. It is a public document,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/cm-amarinder-has-agreed-to-my-decision-to-step-down-ig-kunwar-vijay-101618605859194.html
17-04-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab Police bust illegal weapon smuggling module||The Punjab Police on Friday claimed to have busted an inter-state illicit arms smuggling module with the arrest of three people from Madhya Pradesh.The police also said it has recovered 30 illegal pistols and 32 magazines besides a car and a motorcycle from the trio.The arrested persons were identified as Crore Singh and Ram Singh Patwa, both residents of Pachori village of Burhanpur district in Madhya Pradesh and Chander Pal of Khakhnaar village of the same district, police said.The three accused were arrested on April 15 in raids carried out in two villages, Punjab director general of police (DGP) Dinkar Gupta said.The DGP said Patwa had revealed that the weapons consignment had been supplied to him by a notorious MP-based arms manufacturer and smuggler, Rahul, who had figured earlier also in seizures of arms consignments by Punjab Police within the last six months.Amritsar senior superintendent of police (SSP, rural) Dhruv Dahiya stated that Rahul and the other MP-based smugglers used various social media platforms, including WhatsApp, to establish a wide network of contacts in Punjab, for illegal supply of locally manufactured weapons.These suppliers target vulnerable youth, militant elements, gangsters and radical entities lodged in various jails in the state to supply weapons, said SSP Dahiya adding that Rahul’s links had also been established earlier with an accused lodged inside the Amritsar jail in a drone module busted in 2019.The SSP said that detailed investigations were being conducted to unravel the entire weapons manufacturing, smuggling and supply network, as well as identification of the physical and financial flows associated with the recovered and past consignments into Punjab.Meanwhile, the arrests and recoveries were made part of the investigation into a December 10, 2020 FIR under sections 25, 54, 59 of the Arms Act at Gharinda police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-police-bust-illegal-weapon-smuggling-module-101618605677373.html
17-04-2021||Chandigarh||Wheat growers worried as rough weather may delay harvesting, procurement||Inclement weather that gripped Punjab’s Malwa belt on Friday afternoon has left farmers in the region anxious as it is likely to delay wheat procurement and harvesting by four to five days in different places.Wheat procurement in Fazilka, Muktsar, Mansa, Moga and Bathinda was affected due to the weather.Gurvinder Singh, joint director, department of agriculture, said even mild rainfall may cause immense damage to the standing crop at this juncture.“An advisory has been issued to farmers through extension teams about the unfavourable conditions. Windy and rainy conditions may lead to a drop in yield and we are keeping our fingers crossed,” he said.Muktsar district food and supplies controller Vandana Kumari said climatic conditions may delay the purchase by four days.“An alert for rain was sent by the state headquarters and ample arrangements were made in advance to cover wheat gains in mandis. But as showers enhance moisture level beyond permissible limits in grains, we are not expecting any fresh purchase at most centres in the districts for the next few days,” she said.According to Punjab Agricultural University’s observatory at the Bathinda-based regional research centre, Bathinda and adjoining districts will witness rough climatic conditions till April 21.“Most parts of the region are likely to experience light showers. South Punjab may witness wind velocity of 40km/hour in the next five days,” said Raj Kumar, an agrometeorology scientist at PAU.Fazilka chief agriculture officer Surinder Singh said that of the 2.10 lakh hectares in the district, only 40% crop has been harvested.“Harvesting may get delayed by up to four days due to the sudden change in weather conditions. Presently, the situation is not alarming,” he said.Meanwhile, it has been learnt that state government’s purchase agencies are battling a shortage of gunny bags at different centres in south Punjab.Hargobind Singh of Bajak village, who has been camping at Ghuddha procurement centre since April 8, also complained of non-availability of gunny bags.He was worried that showers would play a spoilsport for farmers further delaying crop purchase due to increased moisture content.“A district mandi official visited the centre on Wednesday and assured to start procurement from Thursday. I am worried as it is the time to start sowing cotton seeds and I am stuck at the mandi for the last eight days,” the farmer said.Another farmer at Teona purchase centre in Bathinda said he was delaying harvest on most part of his 15-acre wheat cultivation due to slow purchase at the mandi.“My brother has been waiting for his turn since procurement began officially on April 10. Gunny bags reached here yesterday and purchase is tardy this time,” he said.However, Bathinda food and civil supplies controller Jaspreet Kahlon maintained that the district was getting a regular supply of gunny bags and the field staff had been instructed to expedite the procurement process.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/wheat-growers-worried-as-rough-weather-may-delay-harvesting-procurement-101618605138744.html
17-04-2021||Delhi||Man stays with body for 1 week||A man struggling with mental health problems and alcoholism lived next to the decomposing body of his mother for several days before the death of the woman was discovered by her neighbours in north-east Delhi’s Usmanpur on Thursday evening, police said.Sanjay Kumar Sain, deputy commissioner of police (north-east), said the death of the woman was due to natural causes arising from old age. “As of now, no foul play has been found. We are investigating the case,” said Sain.While the exact date of the woman’s death could not be immediately ascertained, police said the extent of decomposition suggested that she died at least a week ago. Neighbours, on the other hand, told police that they last saw the woman outside her house at least 10 days ago.According to the police, the woman lived with her 54-year-old son in a house in Usmanpur that belongs to one of her daughters, who lives in a north Delhi neighbourhood.“The woman also has one more son and a daughter. But they had limited communication with their mother or their sibling who stayed with her,” said a police officer. The man who lived with the woman is unemployed, struggling with a mental ailment, and addicted to alcohol, he added.“They sometimes lived at the goodwill of neighbours who would occasionally give them food,” said the officer.There was no interaction with the neighbours for at least 10 days until Thursday, he added.At around 7.15pm on Thursday, the police received a call from the woman’s neighbours who informed the police about a strong stench from her house.“The house was closed from inside. We got it opened and found the woman dead. Her body was heavily decomposed. Her son was found in an inebriated condition on another bed in the same room,” said the officer.The body has been sent for autopsy, and the man is underdoing a medical examination, police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/man-stays-with-body-for-1-week-101618604190831.html
17-04-2021||Delhi||Low enforcement, compliance at airport despite soaring surge||Flyers at the Delhi airport continue to report violations of face mask and social distancing norms by fellow passengers, even as footfall at the terminals has recovered to about 60% of the pre-pandemic level, officials familiar with the matter said on Friday.At a time when the Capital is witnessing 17,000-19,000 new infections a day, experts said that if Covid-appropriate behaviour was not strictly enforced, a closed space like an airport could become a hub of virus transmission.Neha Sharma, a 30-year-old blogger who travels frequently, said violations are spotted at every step.“People are seen occupying seats that are to be left vacant. Instead of four, as directed, 6-7 people are taking the elevators. At the baggage collection belt, people do not follow social distancing and in the bus, while going to the aircraft for boarding, there are too many passengers. Authorities need to station officials at these points who can ensure there are no such violations,” Sharma said.The Indira Gandhi International airport, which resumed flight operations on May 25 last year after two months of closure due to the pandemic, is now witnessing a daily footfall of 90,000 to 100,000 passengers, said the officials cited above. The average daily flight operations have reached 800, 75-80% of the level that the airport handled before.But flyers believe that with the increased footfall, social distancing and enforcement of other Covid-related norms are the lowest priority for airport officials.Ravi Dutt, 26, who recently visited Delhi from Ranchi, said people could be seen taking selfies (photographs of themselves) without masks. “Waiting rooms were crowded. I spent more than eight hours from 8pm Saturday to 4am Sunday at T3 but I could not spot any official or enforcement teams to ensure Covid-safe behaviour,” he said.Even international travellers narrate similar experiences.Sanchit Sawhney, who travelled to Delhi from Abu Dhabi on Friday morning, said: “At many points the arriving passengers need to stand in a queue, like for registering for the mandatory RT-PCR test, at immigration, baggage collection, etc. At these points, social distancing becomes a problem as the number of passengers remains high. But I did not spot any officials enforcing social distancing or telling people to mask up.”Several passengers have taken to social media to post pictures of crowded areas at the airport and question authorities.Delhi on Friday added 19,486 fresh Covid-19 infections, the sixth consecutive day that the daily infection tally hit a record high. On Friday, 141 more people died of the viral infection in the Capital, the most in a single day in the city ever.Dr Jugal Kishore, head of the department of community medicine at Delhi’s Safdarjung hospital, said for a disease that is spreading globally, there is an urgent need to put restrictions at the “port of entry”.“Despite all the lockdown and night curfew, unless enforcement is ensured at the airports, it will be difficult to contain the spread of the virus. People coming in from other countries and and cities gauge the seriousness of the restrictions outside from how strictly the rules are being imposed at the airports. Airports and air travel could be one of the transmission hubs of the virus. This is the reason why air travel was banned last year to contain the spread of the virus,” Kishore said.Dr Lalit Kant, former head of the department of epidemiology at the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), said an airport terminal is a closed space with high chances of transmission of the virus.“It also depends on how well ventilated the building is. Even though most of the passengers are taking flights with a negative Covid report, there is risk if there is a lack of enforcement. The arriving passengers are more at risk as they have to wait in queues for immigration, baggage collection and for the mandatory RT-PCR test. At these places social distancing may become a problem and the authorities must ensure passengers do not flout norms because then it will become difficult to contain the spread of the virus,” Kant said.Another expert, Dr T Jacob John, senior virologist and a former professor at Christian Medical College, Vellore, Tamil Nadu, said airports have a huge amount of space, which is not as bad as small air-conditioned offices.“Spread of the virus in such a big space will not be as bad. But people tend to follow norms only when they are being watched. At the airport there are spaces like waiting rooms and baby rooms, which are closed spaces, where the chances of spread are high. Authorities must make sure that minimum two-feet distance is maintained between the flyers with their mask on at all times. Without strict enforcement, we will make air travel unsafe,” he said.Dr Gauri Aggarwal, founder of Genestrings Diagnostics, which is conducting tests of both arriving and departing passengers at the Delhi airport, said they are collecting 4,000 to 6,000 samples daily. “We have deployed our staff to make sure that when flyers queue up for registration, payment for samples, etc, they follow the rules. We also have online registration and online payment facility for those who want to avoid queueing up,” she said.To contain the spread of the virus inside the airport, the Delhi government on April 2 started fining people in terminals for violating Covid safety rules by not wearing masks properly, sitting on seats marked as to be left vacant, not maintaining social distancing, spitting or violating hygiene norms.In the past 13 days till Thursday, Delhi government officials fined close to 800 passengers inside the terminal buildings of the airport.Government data showed that 798 passengers were fined at Terminal 2 and Terminal 3. The enforcement teams comprise officials from the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) and are assisted by the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF), which secures the airport.Many officials, privy to the situation at the airport, said it is clear that enforcement is not adequate. The officials also said many flyers were callous and negligent in following Covid-appropriate behaviour.Additional district magistrate (ADM) of New Delhi district, D Karthikeyan, said it was observed that people were not following the Covid safety norms as laid by the government. The ADM said many flyers turn unruly and do not cooperate. “In such cases the Delhi police are informed and a case is registered under IPC section 188 against the passenger,” he said.CISF DIF Sachin Badshah said: “We are assisting the Delhi government as and when required in enforcing the safety norms.”Deputy commissioner of police (Delhi airport) Rajeev Ranjan said such passengers would be booked for violating public order under IPC section 188 and under the Pandemic Act. More sections are added in each case as per the specifics of the offence, Ranjan said.The DCP said Delhi police are ensuring that safety norms are followed in the forecourt area of the airport outside the terminal.The airport operator, Delhi International Airport Ltd (DIAL), said it has made markings on the floor to ensure social distancing is maintained inside the terminals. “Regular announcements are made asking passengers to follow Covid-19 protocols including wearing masks, frequently sanitising hands and maintaining social distance. DIAL has also installed artificial intelligence-based passenger tracking system, which alerts terminal staff about any breach of social distancing norms at the entry gates, in check-in area, at security checks and in security hold area. Apart from these, staff is also deployed to encourage passengers to abide by Covid-19 protocols,” the airport operator said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/low-enforcement-compliance-at-airport-despite-soaring-surge-101618603633434.html

Keeping in view the recovery of weapons and the communication equipment it seems to be a well-organised crime and also a big achievement for Himachal police from investigation point of view,” he said.Kundu said that superintendent of police (SP) Baddi Rohit Malpani, who has expertise and a dedicated team for cracking such crimes, was specially deployed to supervise the case.SP Una Arjit Sen Thakur said the accused had come in a stolen car and after looting the wine trader the accused crossed the border within 18 minutes making it difficult to track their movement.Based on technical and field inputs, we tracked their route and identified them within eight-nine hours of the commission of crime.He said the first breakthrough came last week when the police arrested a Khanna resident Ashish Kumar on the charges of providing SIM cards to the accused on fake ID cards.Thakur said the other accused, however, continued to change their location in different states but were in touch with each other.“They would change their location frequently. The cyber team of Baddi police helped analysed their movement and pinpointed their location in a flat at Sector 49 in Chandigarh,” he said.The three accused were arrested in a joint operation of Una and Baddi police and support of Chandigarh police, he said.He said, the police have also recovered four country made pistols, 98 live cartridges ₹ 2.28 lakh cash, six mobile phones, one tab and one laptop.He said the specific roles the three accused played in the robbery is yet to be ascertained. He said the arrested woman claims herself to be wife of one of the accused.“Investigations have found their link with a bigger inter-state gang and more arrests would follow soon,” said Thakur.The SP said that the police couldn’t share the exact details as the investigation in this case was still on. He said the person who rented out the flat to the accused in Chandigarh has also been associated in the investigation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/una-police-crack-armed-robbery-case-3-in-police-net-more-arrests-likely-101618603637227.html

Mh One Prime will telecast this twice a day – at 5pm and 6.30pm – on all three days. Ramesh Kumar, the chief executive officer of the shrine board, said a number of initiatives have been taken for the benefit of devotees. These include live telecast of Shat Chandi Maha Yagya from 11.30am to 1pm everyday during Navratras, live telecast of the morning and evening Atka Aarti and live darshans of Maa Vaishno Devi’s Pindi Roop every morning. Besides, elaborate arrangements have also been made for the pilgrims visiting the Holy Shrine, especially the Bhawan of Vaishno Devi, Atka and the area surrounding it, during Navratras. The tracks leading to the shrine and nearby buildings have been decorated with exquisite fresh flowers of varied varieties brought from various parts of the country and abroad. The breathtaking and festive decorations are a special visual delight for pilgrims who trek for about 12km from Katra to Bhawan, Kumar added.Low footfall this time On Thursday, as many as 10,119 pilgrims arrived in Katra while the day before, around 11,000 pilgrims had come. On Tuesday, the first day of the nine-day long Navratri festival, 14, 281 pilgrims paid a visit. During pre-pandemic times, the average footfall during Navratras used to be around 25,000 to 30,000 pilgrims a day. Last year, the shrine had been closed on March 18 and re-opened on August 16 after a hiatus of almost five months. A health official said 71 travelers had tested positive in Katra on the first day of the festival. This year, the administration has fixed a ceiling of 25, 000 pilgrims a day. Pilgrims arriving in trains are to undergo rapid antigen tests (RATs) at the Katra railway station where Covid kiosks have been set up. Those arriving via road will undergo the test at Lakhanpur—the gateway to Jammu and Kashmir. Local devotees will be tested at Banganga and those flying in will be tested at the Jammu airport. However, it is advisable for pilgrims coming from outside J&K to bring their Covid-19 negative reports, preferably RT-PCR test, not older than 72 hours.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/see-decked-up-vaishno-devi-shrine-on-tv-this-weekend-101618603457557.html

On his arrival at the Jammu airport, the CRPF commando was accorded a rousing reception by his family members, relatives and friends. “I am very happy to be with my family again. I missed my family, especially my daughter, while I was in captivity. I was not even sure if I would be released,” he said while speaking to the media. He added that his heart goes out to the families of the 22 bravehearts who died in the attack. “Their supreme sacrifice can never be forgotten. Each one of them was a brave and patriotic jawan of the nation,” Manhas said.The commando’s family members thanked the mediators, mediapersons, Centre, and Chattisgarh government for their efforts in bringing him back. His wife Meenu said, “I am very happy today. All the efforts have paid rich dividends today. I thank the government, CRPF, media and everyone who played a role in the release of my husband.” After remaining in captivity for five days, the CRPF commando was freed by Naxals in Chattisgarh’s Bijapur on April 8.

While Grover received nine votes, Kumar got eight. The grand old party also secured the deputy mayor’s post as its nominee Rajiv Kaura bagged eight out of the total 17 votes. He had been pitted against saffron party’s Shailender Gupta.Grover had defeated BJP’s former municipal council president Pawan Gupta in the municipal corporation elections held on April 7. The BJP had projected Manish Kumar, an expelled party leader who had fought the election as an Independent, for the mayor’s post, hoping to win through cross voting. The election for the mayor and deputy mayor, earlier slated for April 13, was deferred amid high drama after the Congress members failed to turn up for oath ceremony at the scheduled time. However, they later came with convener Rajinder Rana, who alleged that the administration was acting at the behest of the government.After the controversy, the additional deputy commissioner administered the oath of office to the Congress councillors but elections were deferred as the BJP members and one independent were not sworn in. In the intervening period, Congress leaders Rajendra Rana, Harshwardhan Chauhan and Solan legislator Dhani Ram Shandil kept their councillors at a resort near Shimla to prevent them from jumping the ship. They arrived at the venue of election at a scheduled time and won the top posts.Infighting among various factions had led to the BJP’s defeat in the Solan municipal corporation. Even their poll in-charge and Nahan legislator Rajiv Bindal failed to keep the House intact while his trusted lieutenants lost the poll battle.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/punam-grover-elected-solan-s-first-mayor-rajiv-kaura-to-be-her-deputy-101618603096995.html

17-04-2021||Chandigarh||CM’s meet on SIT: Punjab govt to wait for HC order before taking any recourse||Amid growing criticism from within the Congress and outside over the setback suffered in the 2015 Kotkapura case, the Punjab government plans to wait for the high court order before taking any legal or administrative recourse even as it decided to go for damage control politically. The issue was by discussed by chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh with Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee (PPCC) president Sunil Jakhar, cabinet ministers Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa, Sukhjinder Randhawa and Sukhbinder Sarkaria, Mandi Board chairman Lal Singh and some MLAs, including Kushaldeep Singh Dhillon and Navtej Singh Cheema, at a meeting here on Friday. The ministers and Congress leaders present in the meeting were of the view that the government needs to wait for the high court order before deciding anything even as some of them spoke about the adverse political fallout of the quashing of the SIT probe report. “The government can hold legal consultations and take any decision only after the contents of the high court order are known. The grounds on which the court took the decision are still not clear. There was near consensus that we should wait for the order,” two Congress leaders, including a minister, who attended the meeting, said on condition of anonymity. The Punjab and Haryana high court had last week quashed the probe reports submitted by the Punjab Police SIT in two FIRs registered in connection with the Kotkapura violence, directing the state government to constitute a new SIT, excluding inspector general of police (IGP) Kunwar Vijay Pratap Singh. The IPS officer, who led the probe, has sought voluntary retirement since and stuck to his decision even after the chief minister turned down his request. The legal setback in the politically-sensitive case has led to a barrage of criticism, particularly from within the Congress, over the state government’s handling of the matter. Congress MLA Navjot Singh Sidhu and Rajya Sabha MP Partap Singh Bajwa have hit out at the state government, with the former accusing it of cheating the people on its promise of delivering justice in sacrilege cases. Bajwa has demanded the advocate general Atul Nanda’s resignation. Several other party leaders are also anxious about the political fallout and want the government to move quickly to control the damage. These concerns were mentioned by a minister at the meeting. A Congress MLA said there was no discussion on Sidhu and Bajwa. Both Amarinder and Jakhar could not be contacted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/cms-meet-on-sit-punjab-govt-to-wait-for-hc-order-before-taking-any-recourse-101618602376936.html
17-04-2021||Chandigarh||Set up new SIT to ensure justice to Kotkapura victims: Bajwa||Congress Rajya Sabha member Partap Singh Bajwa on Friday sought the constitution of a new special investigation team (SIT) to probe the Kotkapura police firing case to give justice to the victims at the earliest. In a statement here, Bajwa said the material collected during the investigation of the case was already with the government and the previous SIT and the new team will be able to complete its probe within a given timeframe of one month and file challans against the culprits. The Punjab and Haryana high court had last week quashed the probe reports submitted by Punjab Police in two FIRs registered in connection with the 2015 violence, directing the state government to constitute a new SIT, excluding inspector general of police (IGP) Kunwar Vijay Pratap Singh. The Rajya Sabha MP said one of the options being considered by chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh was to challenge the high court verdict in the Supreme Court. “It is obvious that even if a stay is granted on the impugned order of the high court, the final decision would take time, thus hampering the investigation and delaying justice to the victims of the Kotkapura case. Therefore, even in the best possible situation of getting a stay, the ultimate aim of giving justice to the victims even after five years would remain elusive,” he said, supporting the constitution of another SIT as the second option available in the interim. Bajwa, who earlier termed the quashing of the SIT report a loss of face for the Congress government, said the high court verdict was a monumental failure of the state advocate general Atul Nanda and his office. The AG and his team of lawyers were unable to defend the interests of the state despite the professional and efficient investigation done by Kunwar Vijay and the SIT team, he said, adding that the SIT had done its duty to investigate this sensitive issue for over two years and the government must look for a solution. On Wednesday, Bajwa had demanded Nanda’s resignation in the wake of the setback suffered by the state government in the high court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/set-up-new-sit-to-ensure-justice-to-kotkapura-victims-bajwa-101618602197099.html

He said Sikh tradition is built on ideals of peace, respect, and equality.Further, Sikhs are dedicated to the principle that every person is created equal before God, no matter their race, gender, religion, or creed.Today, the Sikh population in the world stands at 30 million, making it one of the world’s major religions. Nearly 700,000 Sikhs live in the United States, and many of them have made Pennsylvania their home, Toomey said.Sikhs share a strong sense of community, family, and selfless service, as evidenced by their commitment to welcoming and serving individuals from all religious, cultural, and ethnic backgrounds, he said.During the Covid-19 pandemic, Sikh communities across the country, including Pennsylvania, mobilised to deliver meals, groceries, masks, and other supplies to tens of thousands of families in need, he added.“In my own travels across the Commonwealth, I have witnessed firsthand the spirit of this community when meeting with Sikh constituents. It is clear they have enriched their neighbourhoods and contributed in numerous ways to the growth and vitality of Pennsylvania and the United States,” Toomey said.“As a proud member of the American Sikh Congressional Caucus, each year, I join many voices across Congress and the United States in commemorating the holiday of Baisakhi, which took place on April 13 this year,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/us-senator-greets-sikhs-on-baisakhi-guru-teg-bahadur-s-birth-anniversary-101618602017456.html

17-04-2021||Mumbai||Bombay HC grants bail to man arrested with around 8kg ganja||The Bombay high court (HC) recently held that a man booked and arrested under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act for possessing contraband less than commercial quantity could be granted bail, as ascertaining whether the quantity was more than permissible limits was the prerogative of the trial court and that the man had been in jail since 2019. A single bench of justice Sarang Kotwal, while hearing the bail application of Santosh Shinde, was informed by advocate Ganesh Gupta that his client had been arrested along with two others by Navi Mumbai crime branch and each of them were in possession of different quantities of marijuana. Gupta submitted that while the crime branch officers recovered around 2.4 kg and 13.8 kg marijuana from the other two, his client was found to be in possession of 8.4 kgs of the drug, which was much lesser than the permitted commercial quantity, hence his client should be granted bail. The offence occurred on August 1, 2019 when crime branch officers, based on a tip-off, apprehended a woman with marijuana. She led the officers to a larger stash from the house of the second accused. He, in turn, led the investigators to Shinde who was seated in van which contained the contraband. After Shinde’s effort to flee failed, he was arrested and booked under NDPS Act and has been in jail since then. Gupta submitted that as the investigation was over and a charge sheet was filed, Shinde could be released on bail. However, additional public prosecutor AA Takalkar opposed the application saying though the marijuana recovered from the applicant was less than the commercial quantity, the same seized in the connected raids had to be taken into consideration, and as the seized material was more than the permitted amount, the applicant should not be granted bail. After hearing the submissions, the court held that it was not clear whether the marijuana belonged to Shinde and though he tried to flee, it was up to the trial court to decide on his role. It added that as he had been in jail since 2019, it was granting Shinde bail on a personal bond of ₹30,000 and sureties of the same amount.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-grants-bail-to-man-arrested-with-around-8kg-ganja-101618601477369.html

The ‘monument of love’ was already witnessing a decline in footfall since the beginning of April. Tourism trade pundits questioned the closure of the monument at a time when elections were also taking place in different parts of India.“Taj Mahal and other ASI-protected sites all over the nation will remain closed for public viewing till May 15, stated Amarnath Gupta, conservation assistant for Archaeological Survey of India at Taj Mahal. The monument had remained closed for nearly seven months during the first wave of the pandemic. In February 2020, Taj Mahal was in the headlines when the then US President Donald Trump visited the heritage site. On March 2, Agra reported UP’s first Covid positive cases and by March 17, Taj Mahal gates were closed even before the nation went into total lockdown later in March.Taj Mahal gates remained closed despite lockdown lifted in mid 2020 and tourist trade in Agra kept on pressing demand to re-open Taj Mahal. Finally decision was taken to open Taj Mahal on 21st September 2020 but with limited number of visitors allowed. This capping however was removed later on.In March 2021, around 15,000 tourists were visiting Taj Mahal in a day, but the numbers fell when April began. Only 2,512 tourists visited the monument on Thursday, a day prior to closure.“Lakhs of people are attending the Kumbh while elections are on in different parts of the nation. It is ironic that Taj Mahal that sees a footfall of only 2,500 people a day, has been closed,” stated Rakesh Chauhan, president of Hotel and Restaurant Association of Agra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/taj-mahal-other-asi-protected-sites-closed-amid-covid-surge-101618601416362.html
17-04-2021||Mumbai||NCB busts marijuana racket operating from 2BHK flat at Dombivli||The Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) on Thursday busted an indoor marijuana unit being run from a 2BHK flat at Dombivli where two persons were cultivating hybrid marijuana through hydroponic technique — without soil, using artificial light for photosynthesis and air circulation system.The arrested accused are Javed Jahangir Shaikh and Arshad Khatri. NCB allegedly seized more than 1kg hybrid cannabis worth ₹80 lakh from the duo as well as equipment used to cultivate the contraband.NCB zonal director Sameer Wankhede said, “Hydroponic weed is referred to cannabis and is grown without soil. The accused had procured the seeds from Amsterdam and the Netherlands through the dark web and sold the contraband material to suppliers in Mumbai and Pune at the rate of around ₹5,000 per gram. The peddlers, in turn, sold it to consumers at around ₹8,000 per gram.”Shaikh and Khatri were nabbed from Dombivli. During interrogation, they disclosed the location of the flat where they cultivated marijuana. “We then raided the flat. Apart from drugs, we also seized several materials for cultivation, PH regulators, plant nutrients, clay pebbles, water pumps, air circulation systems, CO2 gas cylinders, photosynthesis lighting systems etc,” said Wankhede.During interrogation, the agency learnt that the accused were allegedly producing drugs for more than a year in the flat owned by Rehan Khan, who lives in Saudi Arabia and allegedly financed the activity. “Khan is a relative of Shaikh and financed the racket. Khatri is an expert in hydroponic cultivation while Shaikh used to manage distribution of harvest. We have been investigating to find out their entire network and connection with wanted accused Sahil Flacko,” police said. The sale and purchase of drugs was done in cash and at times also in crypto currency. The drug suppliers mostly approached the customers through social media apps like snapchat and WhatsApp, Wankhede added.The agency learnt about the drug unit run by Shaikh and Khatri during an interrogation of two drug suppliers — Ganesh Sakharam Shere and Siddarnth Amin — who were arrested with 310 gram hydroponic marijuana from Parel on April 12. Both peddlers were supplying the contraband which is highly expensive and are allegedly connected with drug supplier Sahil Shah alias Sahil Flacko, who is in the wanted list from August last year in connection with the drug link to the death of Bollywood actor Sushant Singh Rajput. In another operation, the agency arrested African national Onurah Samuel Mike from Versova and allegedly seized 30 grams of cocaine from him. During interrogation, Mike revealed that Nigerian national Celestian is a frequent visitor to Mumbai and brings cocaine. Celestian had given him 50 capsules (500 grams) during his last visit, which he then sold in Andheri, Bandra and Santacruz.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/ncb-busts-marijuana-racket-operating-from-2bhk-flat-at-dombivli-101618601297539.html
17-04-2021||Mumbai||Bombay HC allows Jain temples to cook, deliver food during 9-day fast||In a relief for the Jain community in Mumbai, Pune and Nashik, the Bombay high court (HC) has permitted Jain temple trusts to cook pious food in their kitchens during the nine-day Ayambil Oli Tap fasting observed from April 19 to 27 and distribute the food through volunteers or delivery agents, not exceeding seven in number.The HC directed the petitioner trusts to ensure that the volunteers followed Covid-related standard operating procedures (SOPs) and to furnish the list of volunteers to jurisdictional police station. A vacation bench of justice Suresh Gupte and justice Abhay Ahuja, while hearing petitions filed by two temple trusts — Shree Trust Atman Kamal Labdhisurishwarji Jain Gyanmandir Trust and Sheth Motisha Religious and Charitable Trust, was informed by advocate Prafulla Shah that as per the court’s suggestion on Thursday, the trusts were willing to deliver the pious food to the homes of devotees through volunteers/delivery agencies. Shah submitted that the number of volunteers for delivery should be according to the size of the dining halls, which varied across different temples. Shah also informed the bench that apart from the two temple trusts, the petition was seeking similar reliefs for 58 Jain temples in the city.Additional government pleader Jyoti Chavan objected to the variation in the number of volunteers or delivery agents, and stated the same should be uniform across all temples due to the current situation. He further said it was agreeable to permit five volunteers or delivery agents for every temple. After hearing the submissions, the court held the SOP of the state did not permit any dining hall to operate hence it was accepting the amendment of the petitioners to include catering the special food through takeaway mode. “Considering that the state has permitted restaurants and other food joints to cater to public through home delivery services and not through dine-in, it would be clearly in the interest of justice to allow these Jain charities to deliver food through home delivery services,” the court noted in its order. It further observed that each of the petitioners and trusts could organise delivery of such cooked food through a team of volunteers not exceeding seven persons or through professional distributions service agencies permitted by SOPs of state. The court further held that, “In preparing food and executing deliveries to devotees, the petitioners and its agents shall abide by the guidelines issued by the state in SOP of April 13, and under no circumstances shall devotees be allowed to enter temple premises for taking away pious food allowed by this order.” The bench also directed the trusts operating delivery system to communicate names and particulars of delivery agents/volunteers to the jurisdictional police station/concerned authority under Disaster Management Act. The court said the order would apply to Jain temples in Pune and Nashik as well, as disposed of the petition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-allows-jain-temples-to-cook-deliver-food-during-9-day-fast-101618600998013.html

The move, which has been initiated on the directives of defence minister Rajnath Singh, is expected to bring the much needed relief to the state capital that has witnessed over 36,000 cases over the last 10 days. The district administration identified Haj House on Kanpur Road and Golden Blossom Resort on Faizabad Road and helped in providing these spaces to DRDO’s representatives in UP. The DRDO team will arrive in Lucknow on Saturday to begin their work. These hospitals will include 250-350 ICU beds. The Central Command of the army will also be roped in, an official said.“Of all the proposed places for the establishment of the makeshift hospitals, we have zeroed in on Haj House and Golden Blossom, where we can set up the beds.

The accused also stalked the complainant and sent her objectionable content to the man who was to marry her, in order to foil her marriage. Pravin Padwal, additional commissioner of police (traffic) said constable Madhav Krishna Vasave was recently suspended pending departmental inquiry. In her complaint to Byculla police last month, the woman constable had alleged that Vasave had befriended her some years ago, and on the pretext of marrying her, raped her on multiple instances. Later the complainant decided to marry another man, said a police source. On learning this, Vasave allegedly threatened her against marrying the other man. “Vasave used to stalk her, abuse her and also threatened to throw acid on her face and to upload videos of their intimate moments, on social media,” said a police officer. The woman constable then filed a complaint against Vasave and a first information report (FIR) was registered against him under the relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code and Information Technology Act. The traffic branch was informed about the FIR against their unit member, following which senior officers suspended him. The suspension order states that Vasave’s acts amounts to indiscipline and irresponsible behaviour and maligns the image of the police department in the society. Deputy commissioner of police (zone 3) Paramjit Singh Dahiya said Vasave has secured interim relief from the arrest from court after seeking anticipatory bail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-cop-suspended-for-rape-of-colleague-threatening-her-of-acid-attack-101618600576789.html

Rahul Sahasrabuddhe, who was appointed by the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) to manage the affairs of the mall after non-payment of taxes by Housing Development Infrastructure Limited (HDIL, which owned Dreams Mall), said he had written to MFB in November stating he was “astonished” that the hospital had been issued a Fire Safety certificate, and that compliance to fire safety norms in the “common area” of the mall would be carried out subject to collection of maintenance charges from shop owners. MFB’s fire officer RB Ghadge, however, said the department carried out an inspection in the mall and not in the hospital in November, and that non-compliances were highlighted in the fire safety report filed by the department, a copy of which was given to Sahasrabuddhe. A fire broke out in Dreams Mall, which housed the Covid-designated hospital in its third floor, in the intervening night of March 25-26. The fire, which raged for over 40 hours, claimed nine lives, including of patients who were on ventilator support. The police booked several people, including directors of HDIL Rakeshkumar Wadhawan, Nikita Amitsingh Trehan, Sarang Wadhawan, Deepak Shirke and directors of Privilege Health Care Services Private Limited (which owns Sunrise Hospital) Amitsingh Trehan, Nikita Amitsingh Trehan and Sweetie Jain, among others, for culpable homicide not amounting to murder. In a letter dated November 12, Sahasrabuddhe wrote to MFB: “The undersigned further understands that the NOC/ Fire Safety Certificates have been issued to the premises owned/ managed/ occupied by HDIL, Privilege Health Care Private Limited (Sunrise Hospital), which are inside the premises of the Dreams Mall. The undersigned is astonished with the fact that all these premises which itself forms part of the area of the Dreams Mall have been considered safe, while the common area of the Dreams Mall have been considered unsafe.” “In spite of all the above, the undersigned understands the gravity of the matter and therefore undersigned undertakes to comply with possible measures ordered by you in terms of having adequate fire safety, subject to the adequate collection of common area maintenance charges and required support from the shop owners of the Dreams Mall,” he wrote. HT has seen a copy of the letter. “The inspection was carried out in the mall and there was no inspection carried inside the hospital on November 3, 2020 [as stated in the Sahasrabuddhe’s letter], considering it had Covid-19 patients. The fire safety compliances of the hospital were dealt separately by the department. Also, it is not correct to connect the functioning of the hospital and that of the mall considering the permissions and fire compliances for both are different. The fact remains that there were certain non-compliances inside the mall premises, which were highlighted by me in the report after the fire safety inspection,” Ghadge said. Asked if it was his duty to ensure compliance of MFB guidelines, Sahasrabuddhe said: “I was doing all possible compliance from the revenue that was coming in from the maintenance given by the shop owners.” The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) in May 2020 had given a provisional occupation certificate to Sunrise Hospital owing to Covid-19 outbreak. The hospital began operations in October with 100 beds. Prabhat S Rahangdale, deputy municipal commissioner of BMC’s disaster management cell, which is conducting a probe into the fire, said, “The investigation is ongoing, and currently we are recording statements of all concerned. The investigation will be concluded soon.” Spokesperson of Sunrise Hospital did not respond to queries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-dreams-mall-fire-admin-mfb-were-aware-of-lack-of-fire-safety-101618600396783.html

If it procures foodgrains from all states, government agencies will not be able to procure the entire produce of farmers from Haryana and Punjab,” he said.He added that the government’s decision to continue with the present system shows its “love for farmers of Haryana and Punjab”.He said that the government had already given proposal to defer the laws for one-and-a-half year and the Supreme Court has stayed the implementation, but some people are agitating over predictions.He alleged that some people and political parties, especially Congress, have their political agendas behind this agitation. “Congress and the comrades are behind this agitation. They are hiding behind flags of farm unions,” he added.He said that farm leaders from Punjab should fight for their rights with their state government by holding protests against their government over hike in sugarcane prices and procurement of six crops on MSP on pattern of Haryana.Dhankar refuted the reports that Centre has asked Haryana government to remove protesting farmers from Delhi borders due to rising cases of Covid-19. “These reports are false,” he said.Dhankar faced protests from farmers when he reached Kurukshetra to attend a party workers’ meeting. Police had to use mild force to remove the protesters and hundreds of farmers were detained.Amid heavy police deployment and barricading, farmers managed to reach near the meeting venue at Ambedkar Bhawan.The sloganeering farmers also tried to jump the barricades.BKU (Charuni) spokesperson Rakesh Bains condemned the use of police to remove protesting farmers.Kurukshetra DSP Ravinder Singh Tomar said police made repeated requests to farmers but they were adamant and tried to remove the barricades, so we had to detain them. He refuted the allegations of police misbehaviour with the farmers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/law-to-guarantee-msp-in-country-will-go-against-farmers-of-haryana-punjab-dhankar-101618600038219.html
17-04-2021||Chandigarh||Ambala’s LPG crematorium used for first time in four months||Four months after an LPG-based crematorium worth ₹60 lakh was made ready to use in Ambala for cremating bodies of Covid patients, first such cremation took place on Thursday. The health department and a religious body tasked with maintaining the Gobindpuri cremation ground on Ram Bagh road in the city have been struggling to convince locals for pollution-free cremation at this gas machine. The machine that works on electricity using LPG cylinders remained unused in a hall specially constructed for it in November. However, after repeated requests and an offer by the Khatri Mahasabha for partial monetary help in the LPG cremation, a 52-year-old male patient, who died of infection, was cremated here. Surender Malhotra, general secretary of the mahasabha, said most of the families they had approached refused cremation in the machine citing religious rituals and customs. “This cremation is faster but costly, so we decided to donate ₹2,600 per cremation to every family. Cremation in this machine costs up to ₹5,000 as compared to regular cremation that costs ₹3,100,” he added. Ambala municipal commissioner Parth Gupta said at least four MC employees are assisting in the process.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ambalas-lpg-crematorium-used-for-first-time-in-four-months-101618600036713.html

17-04-2021||Chandigarh||Decline in infection, vaccine made people reckless says Haryana ACS (health)||Haryana’s national capital region (NCR) districts get impacted due to the spread of coronavirus infection in Delhi. Though the fresh surge of virus this time started in the northern districts, Gurugram, and Faridabad in NCR got impacted the moment the virus surged in Delhi. Additional chief secretary, health, Rajeev Arora in an interview said the situation in NCR districts is pretty much akin to what is happening in Delhi. He also spoke about government’s strategy and preparedness to contain the virus spread. Excerpts:What contrast do you see in the first and second waves in terms of people’s behaviour?The latest surge has broken a lot of myths. The drastic decrease of cases in January-February and introduction of vaccine gave a false sense of confidence to people, leading to recklessness. People thought everything is hunky-dory and the virus is now gone for good. That’s why this time the level of panic reaction is far more than in earlier cases. It may be a while before a major part of the population is vaccinated and only then one can make any authentic observation.Infections are at an all-time high not only in NCR, but the virus is also spreading towards north as well.Definitely, the numbers are looking frightening and belying all projections. But I’m sure that within 7-10 days, the infections will start stabilising as already happened in Kurukshetra, Karnal and Ambala.With limited restrictions in place, the challenge to control the spread has become bigger. What’s your strategy?In the last 15 days, the restrictions have been increased over the mobility of people. Gatherings of all kinds have been capped; schools have been shut down. The fresh surge in northern districts started from schools in Karnal and Kurukshetra. There were more than 1,500 cases only in schools and those would have a multiplier effect on their families. So, these curbs will help in checking the spread.But are curfews and lockdowns an answer?What we need more is self-imposed restrictions. Self-discipline has taken the countries through.NCR districts are scoring high on infection rate. Is there a specific strategy for them?Besides, the traditional strategy, we now have the vaccine. Both these districts have performed very well in terms of vaccination. The fatality rate this time is lower than the previous surge in the NCR when the number of cases was comparatively less. The latest guidelines for Covishield vaccine provide for second jab to be administered at 8-12 weeks. This means the first dose of vaccine will be available to more people. It will definitely have an impact.How much is the bed capacity in the state and ventilators? Are you planning to increase the capacity?See almost 70-75% of the active cases are in home isolation. Home isolation protocols have played an important role for us. As of now, we are managing well. We have ensured oxygen availability for every bed in government medical institutions. Most of the government hospitals in districts have been provided with ventilators and trained manpower. In the last four days, we vaccinated 6.37 lakh individuals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/decline-in-infection-vaccine-made-people-reckless-says-haryana-acs-health-101618599920497.html
17-04-2021||Mumbai||After Shiv Sena, NCP backs MES candidate for Belgaum bypoll||After the Shiv Sena, its coalition partner Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) too has extended support to Maharashtra Ekikaran Samiti (MES) candidate Shubham Shelke in Belgaum Lok Sabha by-election in Karnataka. Maharashtra NCP chief Jayant Patil visited Belgaum on Friday to support Shelke in the bypoll necessitated after Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MP Suresh Angadi died due to Covid-19 in September last year. Belgaum has a significant number of Marathi-speaking population which has been struggling for half a century for inclusion in Maharashtra. MES, which represents this population, fielded its candidate opposite candidates from the BJP and Congress. It has contested elections in the past and has elected members to the Karnataka Assembly.Patil reached Belgaum a day after the Sena extended full support to Shelke for the bypoll scheduled on April 17. Sena leader and Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Raut even held a public rally and a roadshow for Shelke on April 15.Patil accused the BJP of working against the interest of the Marathi-speaking population in Belgaum. “The BJP is not standing with Marathi-speaking people. This has been proved after Devendra Fadanavis (Leader of Opposition in Maharashtra) visited Belgaum and campaigned against MES candidate Shubham Shelke. Fadnavis has always tried to please those sitting in Delhi and doesn’t talk in Maharashtra’s favour,” said Patil who is also Maharashtra water resources minister.Patil was referring to Fadnavis’s campaign to support BJP candidate Mangala Angadi, wife of a former MP, on Thursday. Fadnavis had slammed the Sena and said that Raut had come to Belgaum to target “Hinduism” by playing language politics, and added that Marathi-speaking people should teach him a lesson.Meanwhile, Pandharpur-Mangalwedha Assembly seat in Solapur in Maharashtrais, which will see a fight between NCP and BJP, is going for bypoll on April 17. Counting of votes will be held on May 2 and results will be out on May 4.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/after-shiv-sena-ncp-backs-mes-candidate-for-belgaum-bypoll-101618599857536.html

17-04-2021||Chandigarh||Vehicles violating night curfew to be impounded in Mohali||Any vehicle found plying on Mohali roads during night curfew will be impounded if the person driving it is not among the exempted categories. Amid a steep rise in Covid-19 cases and deaths, the district administration has announced a slew of stringent measures to ensure safety protocol compliance. The treatment, vaccination and outreach activities have also increased multifold, said deputy commissioner Girish Dayalan on Friday. Dayalan said attendance at marriage functions and funerals has now been restricted to 20 people, and regular inspections will be held at marriage palaces. “Not only the guests found violating safety protocols would be penalised, but action would also be taken against the owners of marriage palaces,” he said.Special nakas are being set up around containment zones to maintain a strict vigil on unauthorised movement, and teams comprising police and revenue officers will also conduct surprise checking at markets and other crowded areas to challan the protocol violators, he said. Police will also ensure strict enforcement of curfew from 9pm to 5am, including impounding of vehicles and shutting of liquor vends. “We have constituted 10 additional rapid response teams per subdivision for quick response to distress calls. They will ensure Covid kit distribution and monitor health of the patients,” said the DC. Joint teams of civil and police officers will also keep a tab on patients under home isolation to ensure there is no breach. Additional IT teams have been deployed for better data management of patients, including data entry, removal of duplicate entries, weeding out outside cases and mapping cases to identify hotspots. Pvt hospitals to reserve 50% beds for Covid careReassuring the public that there is no reason to panic as there are sufficient Covid care beds in Mohali, Dayalan said private hospitals have been ordered to reserve at least 50% beds for Covid patients needing critical care as a cautionary measure. Seven hospitals that have been assessed by experts to have provided quality Covid care in the past, including Max, Fortis, Ivy, Indus, Sohana, Grecian and Mayo, have been directed to comply, he said. These hospitals will also deploy some ambulances exclusively for Covid patients. Failure to adhere to these directions will attract criminal penalty as per provisions of the Disaster Management Act and Indian Penal Code, he said.  “We are also monitoring oxygen supply to prevent shortage and overpricing,” said the DC.

Some unknown person killed the woman by slitting her throat with a sharp object and fled after stealing gold ornaments and cash worth ₹3.5 lakh from her house. Bhandup police registered a case of murder and robbery against unknown assailant.The deceased, Ratanben Jain, lived in a chawl alone as her husband died a few years ago.The incident came to light on Thursday around 12.30pm when Jain’s house help came home and found her lying in a pool of blood. She alerted neighbours as well as Jain’s daughter about the incident. Police was also informed about the murder. Police said it appeared that some unknown person entered her house between Wednesday evening and Thursday afternoon with the intension of robbery and killed her. The accused might have carried a big knife as the wound does not match that of a kitchen knife, said senior inspector Shyam Shinde of Bhandup police station. Police recorded statements of her neighbours but no one has seen anyone entering the house. However, the door was not locked from inside when maid went, said the officer.“The woman’s body has been sent to Rajawadi Hospital at Ghatkopar for post-mortem. We have found footage of CCTV camera installed near her house. A police team is scrutinising the footage to ascertain as to who could have visited her residence.

17-04-2021||Chandigarh||Ludhiana MC starts putting reflective tape around cattle to prevent road mishaps||The municipal corporation has started putting reflective tapes around stray cattle on city roads to prevent road mishaps at night. The project was started from the Haibowal area on Thursday evening and the officials said that the belts will be put around over 100 animals in the first phase.MC senior veterinary officer Dr Harbans Dhalla said, “We are planning to purchase 5,000 belts which cost ₹100 each. But, we need approval from the MC general House before that.”With the MC facing shortage of space at animal shelters, hundreds of stray cattle can be seen roaming on city roads, including residential area. This results in road accidents. Recently, the MC had built a shed at Burj Powat village in Machhiwara, which has a capacity to shelter around 150 animals. The civic body has entered into an agreement with an NGO for the upkeep of the animals. But, the arrangement is not sufficient to deal with the stray menace, even though the MC collects around ₹30 lakh as cow cess every month. Govind Godham on Hambran Road is taking care of over 1,300 animals for MC in exchange of monthly fee, but their management has also stopped lifting cattle, citing shortage of space.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-mc-starts-putting-reflective-tape-around-cattle-to-prevent-road-mishaps-101618599621843.html
17-04-2021||Other||IMD:Maharashtra to get normal to near-normal rainfall||The India Meteorological Department’s (IMD) long-range forecast for the upcoming monsoon season suggests that most of Maharashtra, including Mumbai and Pune, are likely to receive ‘normal’ to ‘near normal’ levels of rainfall between June and September this year. Officials said these predictions are purely indicative at this stage and will be refined in an updated forecast to be issued by May-end.Overall, the country is expected to receive normal or above normal rainfall, with reference to the long period average (LPA) – which refers to the average rainfall recorded over 40 years (1961 to 2010). India’s LPA is 880mm. The range for ‘normal’ rainfall is between 96-104% of LPA. “Quantitatively, the monsoon seasonal (June to September) rainfall is likely to be 98% of LPA,” IMD said in a statement on Friday.While a site-specific forecast for the ‘monsoon core zone (MCZ)’, which includes most of Maharashtra, is expected along with the updated forecast in May, a chart, ‘Probability forecast of tercile categories for the seasonal rainfall over India,’ released on Friday by IMD shows that most parts of Maharashtra, particularly the Konkan coast and the drought-prone regions of Vidarbha and Marathwada, are set to receive normal to above normal rainfall.“Most of the interior and coastal Maharashtra looks like it will receive good rainfall this year. Vidarbha and Marathwada may get above normal rainfall. But this forecast is only a stage-one forecast. It is to help policy makers, particularly in agriculture, and it does not give any indication of extreme weather events. For that, the daily operational forecast will come in handy, though authorities can now expect healthy rains, and take stock of disaster management or flood control measures if needed,” said Dr Jayanta Sarkar, scientist, IMD.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/imdmaharashtra-to-get-normal-to-near-normal-rainfall-101618599556068.html

It is reported that almost 200 prisoners amongst 47 prisons in the state have tested positive as of 14 April 2021. This number has gone up from 42 to 200 within nearly a month. It is stated that 86 staff members working in the prisons have also tested positive,” observed the bench. Kumbhakoni representing the state government submitted that the HC had taken up a similar cause in July 2020 and had noted the measures taken by the state government to safeguard prisoners and staff and had issued certain directions. He added that the current situation would be dealt with similarly. Thereafter the bench noted, “The reports, however, show a sudden rise of the Covid-19 cases in the state prisons, indicating a need for the court’s intervention to revisit the measures. This is a fit case where the court should take note of this situation and take up the cause in the public interest.” The court asked the state government and prison authorities to place before it details about the status of Covid-19 status of prison staff, inmates and measures taken or proposed to be taken to control the Covid-19 spread and decongest jails. The court also directed the registry to issue notices to secretaries of the state home department and revenue department, director-general of police, director-general of prisons seeking details on the status of prisoners and jail staff in the next hearing on April 20.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-seeks-info-on-safety-of-maharashtra-prisoners-after-ht-report-101618599256127.html
17-04-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh traders oppose weekend curfew||City traders have opposed the administration’s decision to clamp lockdown on the weekend, saying that the fresh curbs will cause losses to their business, which had barely recovered from the previous year’s crises. Chandigarh Beopar Mandal president Charanjiv Singh said, “The traders are sure to lose out on business. The small traders will be the worst-hit.”The administration in its war room meeting had also said that action must be taken against the shopkeepers attending to customers without masks, which Charanjiv termed an “undemocratic” step. “We insist our customers on covering their faces and even hand out masks for free to those who come without it. However, many a time customers just refuse to comply, which lead to arguments and even more,” he added.Also read: 55-hour weekend curfew clamped in ChandigarhPresident of Sector-11 Market Welfare Association (MWA) and chief spokesperson of the Beopar Mandal, Diwakar Sahoonja, said, “Traders are organising awareness campaigns and distributing masks and sanitisers. It is not right on the administration’s part to alienate us this way.”Meanwhile, following the latest guidelines, large crowds gathered at the Sector-26 grain market on Friday. One of the wholesale traders here, Tarsem Kumar, said, “The lockdown poses great challenges for traders like me, who stay in Panchkula and have to travel to work. Last year too, we faced problems due to this and some panic buying could be seen here again.”However, in most of the markets, footfall continued to remain on the lower side. President of Sector-46 MWA, Balwinder Singh, said, “We understand that cases are rising, but such curbs will destroy our business. Some concessions must be made for the markets.”Punjab Mandi Board has also written to its Chandigarh staff to keep the apni mandis closed on Saturday and Sunday. Residents divided over weekend lockdownBaljinder Bittu, chairman of Federation of Sector Welfare Associations Chandigarh (FOSWAC), said, “The weekend lockdown is a half-baked measure. Covid can spread on the weekdays as well, so what’s the point of restricting movement for just two days.” Meanwhile, chairman of Chandigarh Resident Association Welfare Federation (CRAWFED) Hitesh Puri said, “The weekend lockdown is a result of refusal of people to adhere to the SOPs. The administration has taken this measure to send out a warning that people need to take the rules more seriously.”Meanwhile, closure of factories has elicited sharp response from the industry. “Even in Delhi and Mumbai, the industry is not closed during lockdown. With SOPs in place, the industry should be allowed to operate like essential services. The manufacturing activity had just started to gain momentum. The shutdown will be a big blow to the SMEs in particular and the whole economy in general. There will be loss in revenues, including GST. Any additional restrictions can lead to migration of labour as well,” said Naveen Manglani, president, Chamber of Chandigarh Industries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-traders-oppose-weekend-curfew-101618599197465.html
17-04-2021||Mumbai||ICSE, ISC exams deferred; Cambridge cancels exams||The Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations (CISCE) has deferred its ICSE (Class 10) and ISC (Class 12) exams which were earlier scheduled to take place from the first week of May due to growing Covid-19 cases across the country.In its official release, the board stated that it will wait until the first week of June to take a review of the situation and decide on the conduct of exams. “ICSE students, however, can currently choose between two options- to write the exams along with the ISC candidates or to not write the exam. In case they choose the latter, the board will develop a fair and unbiased criterion while preparing the results of such candidates,” said Gerry Arathoon, chief executive and secretary of the board in the release. Parents welcomed the decision and said it will help students who have already decided their future options escape the uncertainty of exams. “Many students wish to take admission in small science colleges run by coaching classes where they are already studying. There are also quite a few who wish to continue in their respective schools. For such students, internal assessments will be the best possible solution. Students who wish to take the exams can still do so,” said a parent from Andheri. Over 23,000 students from Maharashtra took the ICSE exam in 2020 while 3,150 students wrote their ISC exams last year. This year, ICSE exams were earlier scheduled between May 5 and June 7 and ISC exams were to be held between May 5 and June 16. Meanwhile, Cambridge International has announced late Friday evening that all its exams including IGCSE which were scheduled for next week will be cancelled. “Given the increasing number of Covid-19 cases in the country, we have decided to switch Cambridge International schools in India, from exams to school-assessed grades, so that students can receive certification and progress with their education,” said the board in its statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/icse-isc-exams-deferred-cambridge-cancels-exams-101618599196102.html

Between the period, 99,022 people between the age group of 11 to 20 and 38,265 children up to age 10 have tested positive in Maharashtra. The two categories constituted 137,287 or 9.06% of the total positive 1,513,882 cases, clocked in the state in the last two months. Data showed that children and adolescents are getting more affected in the second Covid-19 wave compared to the first wave in the state. The data from the state medical education and drugs department (MEDD) revealed that between August 15 and October 15, when Maharashtra hit its first peak, the number of children infected were 34,154 and adolescents infected were 66,272. State health department officials blamed the rise in cases among the age group to “moving population” between the age of 21 to 40, which “bring home the infection”. Officials added that the fatality in the age group is low owing to better immunity.“The cases among children and adolescents have increased in the second wave compared to the first one. The moving population do not follow the Covid-appropriate behaviour properly. As they move out and about, they bring home the infection. Therefore, one has to be extremely careful while moving out,” said Dr TP Lahane, director of directorate of medical education and research (DMER).Lahane added that the symptoms have changed in the age group from the last wave. He added that most children largely remained asymptomatic in the first wave, but now show mild symptoms. “The disease is mild in 80% of the cases. But slight change has been observed in symptoms. Such as patients getting loose motions, nasal watering, stomach-related issues, recurring fever, etc. however the fatality is very low,” said Lahane.Dr Soonu Udani, a paediatrician and critical care specialist at SRCC Children’s Hospital, said that the number of children being hospitalised has increased from the first wave. She added that the symptoms too have changed from the previous wave. She added that the biggest change from the previous wave was in the symptoms and the number of “very sick” cases that land up in the hospital.“In the first wave, we saw children with mild fever and few were very sick. From the 120 children, we saw last year, five or six were sick. This time, it is just the opposite. Our figures show that from April 1 to today, we have had 17 or 18 admissions, including a newborn and a five-year-old. Of them, nine patients are very sick. They are coming with different symptoms from last time, like pneumonia, convulsions, encephalopathy, which is drowsiness, stupor, unresponsiveness, etc. Also, mild ones have had diarrhoea. Unless they are dehydrated, we don’t admit them, but the number of such cases is high,” she said.Dr Lancelot Pinto, epidemiologist, who is attached to PD Hinduja Hospital, said that the high number of cases is a reflection of the demographic. “Our median age is 27 years, if the virus is affecting every second person, it is bound to affect children as well. Besides that, many people have been stepping out of the home, so children have contracted the infection too.” He added that children have a better immune system than adults and therefore they will recover faster. “For most of the children, it is like any other mild respiratory tract infection which lasts for three days. An extremely small percentage of people need to be admitted to hospitals and even a low percentage of children die with Covid, across the world. However, we need to see if children develop any inflammatory syndrome MIS-C (Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children) after a month,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/99000-adolescents-38-000-kids-in-maharashtra-covid-positive-in-2-months-data-101618599078398.html

The order was revised as 52 critical patients are undergoing cancer treatment at the hospital and they cannot be shifted out of it.Due to this, instead of all 227 beds, 175 beds of the hospital will now be for Covid and the remaining 52 beds will continue to remain for non-Covid patients where critical patients are currently admitted, the BMC said in a circular on Friday.Municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal had in a circular issued on Thursday said that the hospital should be converted into a complete Covid-19 hospital and within 48 hours all non-Covid-19 patients should be shifted out to nearby hospitals. This decision was taken in the light of increasing cases in the city that increased demand for hospital beds.However, on Friday the order was reversed by the BMC. In a circular, the BMC said, “Given the current surge in Covid-19 patients in urgent need of hospitalisation, it was decided to convert Jaslok Hospital into dedicated Covid-19 hospital, catering to Covid patients only and order to that effect was communicated to the management of Jaslok Hospital on April 14. However, it has been brought to the notice of BMC by the said management that presently 30 critical patients undergoing cancer treatment and another 22 critical patients undergoing treatment are already admitted to the hospital. Considering their medical condition, shifting them to other hospitals at this juncture, may prove fatal. Hence, it is imperative on part of BMC not to risk the lives of these 52 critical non-Covid patients, presently admitted in Jaslok hospital.”Post detailed discussion with BMC today, Jaslok Hospital and Research Centre, Mumbai has increased its Covid-19 bed capacity to 175. In a statement issued on Friday, Jaslok Hospital, said, “Together, we stand by the Government in this fight against the second Covid-19 wave.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-civic-body-reverses-decisions-to-convert-jaslok-hospital-into-complete-covid-19-facility-101618598896083.html

The decision was taken by the four-judge bench of HC in a suo motu public interest litigation (PIL) given the alarming situation in the state due to the exponential rise in active Covid-19 cases. The court said that the interim orders shall remain in abeyance till May 7. The full bench comprising of chief justice Dipankar Datta, justices AA Sayed, SS Shinde and PB Varale passed the order and said that all interim orders passed earlier by various courts on April 9, 12, 15 and expiring on April 19 or soon thereafter would be unconditionally extended till May 7 or until further orders unless specifically dealt with by any judicial order to the contrary. Soon after the situation had improved last year, in December 2020, the full bench, had held that as citizens would be able to access various courts thereafter had said that the abeyance orders passed soon after the lockdown was announced last year and was extended from time to time need not be extended beyond January 31, 2021. On Friday, the bench noted, “The second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, has been wreaking havoc just as the first wave did in the year that went by.” The bench further held that in light of the situation, measures and restrictions imposed by the state government had imposed rendered it difficult to conduct judicial proceedings in HC as well as other courts/tribunals in the districts/talukas in the physical presence of advocates, litigants and other stakeholders, and with the full complement of officers/staff. “As an obvious consequence, access to justice has been hindered,” observed the full bench. The bench also opined that it would be desirable that until May 7 or until further orders, whichever is earlier, removal of encroachers without notice was not resorted to and posted further hearing to May 6. With regards to the functioning of HC and lower courts, a committee comprising administrative judges of the HC along with representatives of central and state government and various lawyer associations decided that subordinate courts would work in one shift of two and a half hours from April 19 and trial courts would take up cases of remand, bail and urgent criminal and civil matters through physical hearing. The committee further decided that a limited number of benches of HC would conduct virtual hearings on urgent matters and set aside the regular hearings scheduled after April 19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-extends-interim-orders-staying-eviction-demolition-dispossession-till-may-7-101618598597364.html
17-04-2021||Chandigarh||Ludhiana MC razes 22 encroachments along Buddha Nullah||Continuing the crackdown on illegal encroachments along the Buddha Nullah, a municipal corporation (MC) team on Friday razed 22 structures in the form of houses at Gopal Nagar and Upkar Nagar.Officials said that the encroachments had to be removed as the civic body is planning to construct a road along the nullah and install an iron fencing to stop residents from dumping waste. Residents of the houses which were razed said they had been living there for over two decades and MC has demolished their homes without prior notice. They also accused the civic body of adopting a pick-and-choose policy while taking action against encroachments and added that no action is being taken against influential or high income families.Officials said that the encroachers had been given a chance to leave the site, when the MC teams marked illegal structures around two weeks ago, but they didn’t do so.Assistant town planner (ATP) MS Bedi said, “The MC has identified over 950 encroachments along the nullah and they are being removed in phases. Action will also be taken against the other encroachments.”Drive in Shivpuri postponed amid resistanceThe MC teams also went to demolish a building in Shivpuri on Friday but had to postpone the drive after residents gathered at the spot and showed resistance. Members of Jagriti Sena also joined the protesting residents.President of Jagriti Sena Parveen Dang said, “The MC team came to demolish the buildings without giving any notice. The owners have documents of ownership and MC should give them a chance to present them. If anyone is found encroaching upon the nullah land, then action can be taken against his building.” Encroachers seek flats under BSUP Scheme At a time when the state government is giving proprietary rights to the slum dwellers in the state, the encroachers demanded that they are allotted flats constructed under the Basic Services for Urban Poor (BSUP) Scheme. The MC has been allotting flats constructed in Giaspura and Mundiyan areas to slum dwellers who were removed from government landsOne of the encroachers, Harpreet Kaur, who works as caretaker said, “I have two sons to look after. Where will I go after MC demolished my house without notice. Our family has been living in this house since 1987. We will approach mayor Balkar Singh Sandhu seeking allotment of flats.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-mc-razes-22-encroachments-along-buddha-nullah-101618598596855.html
17-04-2021||Chandigarh||Congress goes on publicity blitz over Ludhiana’s Sidhwan Canal Bridge project||In an attempt by Congress leaders to seemingly blow their own trumpet, two weeks after the BRS Nagar Sidhwan Canal Bridge was thrown open to the public, huge billboards featuring Punjab minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu have been erected on both sides of the bridge, with messages that read: “We promised & delivered”.The billboards, three on one side and two on the other, instantly catch one’s attention and can’t be missed.A party insider said these were installed following a meeting with Congress’ poll strategist Prashant Kishore, in which he instructed Congress leaders to project the development works being carried out by them at their respective assembly constituencies.While civic body officials say they are not involved with the hoardings being installed, Charanjit Singh, superintendent with the MC, who deals with outdoor advertisements, said government advertisements were routed through the district public relations officer (DPRO).On the other hand, DPRO Puneetpal Singh Gill said no such advertisement was placed by the government.Shavinder Singh Sandhu, co-founder of LeafBerry, the firm which has been given the contract for outdoor advertising in the city, said that it was a paid ad for one day. “However, we did not receive any new booking and so, the posters were not taken down,” Sandhu said. However, he did not share details on who had booked the space.The outdoor advertisement contractor was recently in news after the civic body chose to waive its dues of around ₹8 crore during the MC general House meeting.Shiromani Akali Dal spokesperson Maheshinder Singh Grewal termed it as a classic case of quid pro quo. “The government favoured the outdoor advertiser and in return, the firm is favouring the minister.”Ashu refused to comment and said that the mayor should be asked about anything related to advertising.Mayor Balkar Singh Sandhu said the advertisement was the prerogative of the outdoor advertiser and the civic body has nothing to do with it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/congress-goes-on-publicity-blitz-over-ludhiana-s-sidhwan-canal-bridge-project-101618598482117.html

Thackeray said that a quick turnaround of reports will help detect cases faster and prevent the second wave from getting bigger.“The number of cases are quickly increasing. In such a scenario, early detection will help to contain the spread of coronavirus. Therefore, all laboratories must be asked to give reports in the least possible turnaround. Similarly, looking at the surge, augmenting bed capacity should also be done,” Thackeray said in the meeting.State environment and tourism minister Aaditya Thackeray, who is also the guardian minister of Mumbai suburban district, said that people working in the corporate sector should go for rapid antigen test, which will help to identify positive cases quickly and also reduce the load on RT-PCR laboratories, a statement from the chief minister’s office (CMO) said.According to a statement, municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal apprised the CM that the city’s total bed capacity will reach 22,000 from the existing 20,400. He also said that 3,900 beds are currently available in the city, and since February 10, the civic body has added 1,050 intensive care unit (ICU) beds in the city.Senior government officials said that the availability of hospital is not an issue at the moment as the number of cases registered and discharges recorded are around the same.

17-04-2021||Other||Pandemic effect: IITs see fewer job offers this placement season||The pandemic has hit the ongoing placements season at the premiere Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs), with several of these institutes bracing for poor recruitment statistics this year. At IIT-Bombay (IIT-B), a bulk of all jobs were offered during the first phase of placements in December last year. In the second phase, which kicked off in January, 125 students have been placed so far. “We are striving to minimise the negative impact on campus recruitment process due to the pandemic situation,” said BV Ravi Shankar, training and placement officer. Shankar said a similar number of companies had participated in the placement drive as compared to last year, with a few new firms joining the league. However, the overall statistics of recruitment may be poorer this year. “Due to market conditions, international placements, university faculty (PhD) and public sector undertakings (PSU) recruitments have been fewer this year, and this [has] affected our overall statistics,” he added. During the 15-day phase I of placements in December, the institute saw an 18% drop in the number of job offers from 2019. Fewer PSUs or government organisations shopped for talent this year, said many IITs. The Madras campus saw four PSUs recruit students, while the Guwahati campus hosted two PSUs. At IIT-Delhi, the number of PSUs that participated in the placement drive was in single digits, said Anishya Madan, head, office of career services, IIT-Delhi, where so far around 1,000 students have secured jobs. “[There have been] fewer number of selections per company. Some companies have deferred hiring this year because of the pandemic,” said Madan. IIT-Patna, where 109 out of 178 registered students are placed, said that placements were off to an erratic start but corrected their course over time. “At the start of the pandemic, some companies were very reluctant to conduct the placement process due to the sudden slump in the economy and the uncertainty all around. Hence, compared to the placement season of 2020, some companies were missed out. However, this year we also saw over 45 new recruiters,” said Kripa Shankar Singh, training and placement officer, IIT-Patna. Last year, when the pandemic broke out, many companies rescinded their offers made to students during the placement drive of 2019-20. Therefore, institutes have been careful this year to avoid such a situation. “We are in talks with companies to ensure that job offers made during the placement season are honoured,” said Shankar from IIT-B. “The institute was in constant communication with all the recruiters and only those companies that showed confidence in their hiring process this year were invited for placement,” said Abhishek Kumar, head, Centre for Career Development at IIT-Guwahati, where 28 offers were rescinded last year. Many IITs allowed students with rescinded offers to sit for placements this year. At IIT-Guwahati, eight such students received on-campus jobs and others received off-campus jobs. IIT-Madras allowed 157 students from the 2020 batch to register for placements this year. “Of these, 27 have been placed,” said CS Shankar Ram, advisor (training and placement), IIT-Madras, where 838 of the 1,470 registered students have secured jobs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/pandemic-effect-iits-see-fewer-job-offers-this-placement-season-101618598176021.html

The court has directed Taloja jail authorities to take the necessary measures to ensure Kazi’s security. He was arrested on April 11 for his alleged involvement in conspiracy and destruction of evidence with another suspended cop Sachin Vaze – the main accused and in the Antilia explosives scare and Mansukh Hiran murder cases. Kazi was earlier remanded to NIA custody till Friday. He was produced before the special court as his NIA custody ended on Friday. NIA said that it did not require the further custody of the suspended Mumbai Police officer and urged the court to remand him to judicial custody. Kazi’s lawyer, advocate Hasnain Kazi, moved an application expressing threat perception for his client while in jail, and pleaded that his security aspect be appropriately considered by the prison authorities. The court then directed the jail authorities to take proper care of Kazi’s security. Kazi was moved to Taloja prison after the demand proceeding. According to NIA, Kazi was working as assistant police inspector in the crime intelligence unit (CIU) and was well aware about Vaze’s plan to create a security scare near industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s residence. The federal agency also claimed that Kazi was aware of the design and the things that transpired after the case was transferred to NIA, and hence, started destroying evidence such as CPU (central processing unit) and DVR (digital video recorder). Kazi was also along with Vaze while recovering evidence in the case, which Vaze was probing initially. On February 25, an SUV was found abandoned near Antilia on Carmichael Road in south Mumbai with 20 loose gelatin sticks and a threatening note addressed to Ambani. Meanwhile, the court granted permission to Vaze, who is also lodged at Taloja jail, to speak to his lawyer from the prison. Vaze had pleaded that he needs to speak to his lawyer to discuss further legal remedies. He had also alleged that on April 12 and April 15, he was allowed to speak to his lawyer only for five minutes, after which the call was disconnected.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/antilia-explosives-scare-suspended-mumbai-cop-riyazuddin-kazi-in-judicial-custody-till-april-23-101618597817515.html

Thereon, police filed a charge-sheet against the boy within days.Boy sought probe through police chiefChallenging the woman’s claims, on February 18, 2020, the boy filed a complaint to the commissioner of police, seeking a probe into the matter. The boy had alleged that it was in fact the woman who had been sexually exploiting him for two years after offering to help him in studies.He had claimed that contrary to her claims, she herself took him to the hotel and sexually assaulted him, while threatening to share his objectionable pictures with his parents.The teenager had confided in his relatives, following which they approached the woman’s family and they decided to get them married once he was 18. But, the woman filed a police complaint against him out of nowhere, he alleged.The commissioner of police had then marked an inquiry to the special branch, which took note of the age of the boy and the woman, and moved an application in court for further investigation. Since then, the woman has been skipping court hearings, the branch officials said, while refusing to provide more details about the probe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/court-issues-warrants-against-ludhiana-woman-who-accuses-teen-of-rape-101618596196510.html
17-04-2021||Pune||Ajit Pawar warns Pune of complete lockdown if curfew rules are not followed||Maharashtra deputy chief minister and finance minister Ajit Pawar warned Pune residents of a complete lockdown if curfew rules are not followed. Pawar said that if people do not cooperate even after the imposition of curfew then the administration may have to impose complete lockdown like last year unwillingly. “Pune residents gave a good response to the weekend lockdown. I am hoping that they will follow the rules in the upcoming days. Otherwise as some of my fellow ministers have warned, a complete lockdown like last year may have to be imposed. I request citizens to follow the rules and do not push the administration to take this decision. In complete lockdown, many suffered a great deal of hardships,” Pawar said. The curfew has been receiving a lukewarm response in Pune. Pawar approved ₹1 crore to each of the 288 MLAs in Maharashtra for immediate spending on Covid-related issues. After taking a review of the Covid situation in Pune, Pawar told reporters that a total of ₹350 crore has been sanctioned under local area development fund for legislators. “There was an increasing demand from members of the legislative assembly (MLAs) and the legislative council to get permission to spend a portion of their local area development fund for Covid relief work. Last year, the quota of MLAs local area fund was ₹3 crore and they were granted permission to spend ₹50 lakh of it for Covid work. Of the ₹4 crore funds for the local area development, they can now spend ₹1 crore for immediate Covid relief work in their constituencies,” Pawar said. “A total of ₹350 crore has been granted for immediate Covid relief work for all the districts in Maharashtra through the MLA’s local area development funds,” said Pawar. Pawar also asked the resident doctors of Sassoon hospital who had threatened to go on a strike citing various demands to adopt a humanitarian approach and cooperate in the time of crisis. “I have scheduled a meeting of the concerned authorities with these doctors. They will listen to what they have to say. If they have valid reasons, then we will consider those. If they take extreme steps, then we will have to take decisions accordingly.

17-04-2021||Pune||Distress calls, anxiety likely to increase post second wave, psychiatrists say||The second Covid-19 wave that has distrubed normalcy and adding an unprecedented burden on healthcare is expected to cause more damages. According to city-based psychiatrists, there is a fear of a sudden increase in psychological cases after the second wave by at least 30 per cent. “At this time, we have been receiving getting calls regarding Covid anxiety, phobia, and financial insecurities for the past 10 to 15 days, even before the lockdown was announced. There is a definite increase of 10 to 20 per cent these days taking new cases to more than 30 per cent after the first lockdown,” said Dr Dhananjay Ashturkar, psychiatrist, Asthaa hospital, Chinchwad. Following the first wave, the divisional commissioner of Pune had announced post-Covid 19 counseling centres for dealing with psychological problems in September 2020, whereupon at least 12 per cent of the 2 lakh discharged patients sought help. However, according to psychiatrists, this time the number might go up post the second wave of Covid-19 and lockdown. He further added that they are expecting more calls post the 15-day lockdown. “The people have still not recovered from the first lockdown and just gotten back to their regular way of life when suddenly this lockdown has been announced. It is a major setback. Everybody is affected in one way or another, but my advice would be to follow the government instructions, stay at home and if anyone feels anxious, call a doctor for help,” he added. Dr Archana Jawadekar, psychiatrist and professor with DY Patil medical college also stressed that the impact of the first wave of Covid-19 and the lockdown was still there and this extended lockdown has hampered their health. “There is a mixed reaction to this lockdown and yes, there is an immense fear and anxiety among people, especially the youth about job security,” she said. Jawadekar has also researched the psychological impact on people and found that women had more anxiety attacks and problems as well as youth who are now uncertain about their future. Psychiatrists feel that the government is concentrating on the health sector and getting oxygen beds and ventilators and completely brushed aside the psychological effect on the people in general. According to Dr Purva Deshpande, consultant psychotherapist and private practioner, there’s a rise in anxiety and people are seeking help and intervention for better mental health not only for themselves but also for the whole family. ] “The second wave has pushed people to mainly two polar opposites. The first one is people getting anxious to the core of their survival, and second, of those who have absolutely started denying any concern over health as the anxiety is paralysing and paramount,” she said.Dr Deshpande added, however, the disguised presentation of this denial can be seen in everyday behaviour in the form of increased irritability, disturbed sleep and pervasive feeling of helplessness. “The way emotional reactions are formed, dealt and dissolved depends to a great extent on the age and the resilience of the person,” said Dr Deshpande. Box Connecting NGO offers support The rising Covid-19 cases and the grim situation surrounding healthcare are forcing many in need of emotional support.

17-04-2021||Pune||Rakshaknagar–Kharadi Covid centre plays key role in isolating symptomatic patients||The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has begun four Covid-19 care centres (CCC) to treat mildly symptomatic patients and keep them isolated. The Rakshaknagar-Kharadi centre plays an important role to provide relief to symptomatic patients of the Ahmednagar road area.Though, the PMC has advised mildly symptomatic patients to home isolate, many don’t have the facility for home isolation. Therefore, the PMC has started the four centres which consists of a total 1,200 isolation beds. These centres don’t have oxygen facilities. Thecentres provide proper food medicine and isolation facilities to Covid-19 symptomatic patients. The Kharadi Covid centre, until recently, was the only Covid centre operating in the city. With the rising number of Covid-19 cases, the PMC started Gangadham (Katraj), Bankar School (Hadapsar) and Sant Dyneshwar government hostel (Vishrantwadi). Rakshaknagar-Kharadi centre has been operating from the first week of March with a capacity of 250 isolation beds. There is a swab centre and daily, a total of 250-300 swabs are collected. Dr Tirupati Panchal, ward medical officer Rakshaknagar-Kharadi centre said, “We provide basic medicine, isolation facilities. We have a staff of nine doctors and six nurses. Till date, more than 600 patients have recovered and been discharged from the centre.” At present, there are 236 patients admitted to the centre. “We are admitting patients from Vadgaonsheri, Vimannagar, Kharadi, Chandannagar, and Wagholi,” Panchal said. Bhaiyyasaheb Jadhav, local corporator of Nationalist Congress party (NCP) said, “Rakshaknagar centre is providing good isolation facility to needy patients. However, there is no oxygen bed. So, we have asked the PMC commissioner and chief health officer to provide an oxygen bed facility.” Devidas Deshpande, who was discharged from the centre, said, “When I tested positive, I approached the PMC and they advised me to stay at the Kharadi Covid centre as it was the only centre operating in the city. The centre is spacious, it has good ventilation. In one hall, there are six patients. PMC provides the meals. Doctors visit regularly for check-ups. Overall, it was a good experience.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/rakshaknagarkharadi-covid-centre-plays-key-role-in-isolating-symptomatic-patients-101618587615338.html

Students are happy about the management done by the university to conduct the exams in online mode. I will still suggest improving the helpline number management system in terms of getting a quick response, said Kamlakar Shete, an SPPU student. Indrakumar Shinde, another student said, “I am appearing for the second-year commerce exams, and it was a good experience for me. When I login for the examination, the system is smooth and we can easily appear, give the answers and submit the exam in time.” Last year from October 12, 2020, SPPU started its final year exams for 3,300 subjects for which 2.5 lakh students enrolled.

Annapurna-1, an 8,091-metre tall mountain, the world’s 10th tallest, on April 16.This marks the Pune mountaineering club’s, eighth successful expedition where a peak 8000-mts and taller has been scaled.Mt. Annapurna-1 comes after Mt Everest in 2012, Mt Lhotse (fourth tallest in the world) in 2013; Mt Makalu (fifth tallest in the world) in 2014; Mt Cho Oyu (sixth tallest in the world); Mt Dhaulagiri (seventh tallest in the world) in 2016; Mt Manaslu (eighth tallest in the world) in 2017; and Mt. Kanchenjunga (third tallest in the world) in 2019.Umesh Zirpe of Giripremi said via mail that after terrible snowfall, the summit push commenced at midnight on Thursday, with the mountaineers facing gushing winds throughout the climb till dawn. Due to a shortage of rope just 800 metres below the summit, the leading team had to stop their climb midway and returned to camp four on April 15. “Chhang Dawa Sherpa and I, who were operating from base camp, arranged the necessary equipment from Kathmandu to camp four on war footing. This ensured the second attempt of the route. Considering the weather forecast and the slim weather window, Giripremi’s team followed the lead team for their summit push. The cloud cover gathering near the summit in the morning affected the pace of the climbers. However, after overcoming all the challenges, Giripremi’s Bhushan, Sumeet and Jitendra unfurled the Indian tricolor on the summit of Mt. Annapurna-1,” Zirpe said.Mt. Annapurna-1 is located in Nepal Himalaya’s Annapurna massif. This massif is home to several tall mountains. The Annapurna massif is 55km long, surrounded by Gandki and Marshyangadi glaciers. Long ridges, avalanche-prone areas are characteristic of the massif, which makes climbing extremely difficult. To date, 250 climbers have reached the summit of Mt. Annapurna-1 successfully.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/giripremi-mountaineers-scale-mt-annapurna-1-world-s-10th-tallest-peak-101618582156643.html

Only essential activities will be allowed.” “No person shall leave their homes or shall move on foot or by vehicle or travel or stand or roam around on any road or public places during the lockdown period,” states the order issued by deputy commissioner Mandip Singh Brar under Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code.Parida said the decision has been taken to restrict the spread of infection in “avoidable travel or gatherings” during weekends. “We will see if we can break the chain,” he said. Any breach of the order will invite action under Sections 51 to 60 of the Disaster Management Act and Section 188 of the Indian Penal Code along with other appropriate laws.

17-04-2021||Lucknow||Institute for Competitiveness Report studies UP government's handling of migrant crisis||The handling of the migrant crisis by the Yogi Adityanath government in Uttar Pradesh (UP) has been studied in detail by the Institute for Competitiveness (IFC), which has submitted a report on the same to the government.An official government spokesperson, while sharing details of the study last week, said it highlighted the humanitarian crisis of migrant labourers that unfolded in 2020, and focused on how the UP government handled the migrant crisis. While the spokesperson referred to it as a Harvard study in a statement, the Institute for Competitiveness said subsequently that it is only part of the Microeconomics of Competitiveness network of the Institute of Strategy and Competitiveness at the Harvard Business School and that it is “inaccurate” to refer to it as a “Harvard study”.The government spokesperson said the Yogi government worked towards the multifold agenda of providing transportation facilities, delivering ration kits, and running health care centres for outbreak prevention.The migrant labourers mainly relied on daily wages for survival and the state government announced schemes to provide free ration to the migrants, according to him.The report, IFC said, documented efforts by the UP government on three parameters: migrant support, health infastructure, and livelihood opportunities.The state government formulated a plan to ensure the safe return of migrants and create employment opportunities. UP government in consonance with the central government took a holistic approach towards addressing the crisis, the government statement said.Besides providing buses and train services for stranded migrants, the state government also arranged transportation facilities for within-state travel and made efforts to publicise the schemes of the government, the report enumerated.The state government collaborated with Indian railways and arranged 1604 trains and brought back over 2.1 million migrants through Shramik trains i.e. 80 % of the total migrants who returned to the state.The state government also set up 18,140 quarantine facilities as per the guidelines issued by National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) and a total of 1.5 million migrants were quarantined at different points in time.According to the report, a total of ₹151 crore was transferred to the account of 1.5 million migrants .IFC said that the report isn’t a comparative study and looks into how the UP government handled the crisis.(This article, which was originally published in the Lucknow edition of Hindustan Times, has been edited for accuracy.

17-04-2021||World||Harry, William seen chatting after Prince Philip’s funeral||A year after they last saw one another, Prince William and his brother Prince Harry put their fraught relationship aside as they said farewell to their grandfather at his funeral on Saturday.The brothers were somber and silent as they walked together in a procession behind Prince Philip’s coffin before his funeral at Windsor Castle along with their father, Prince Charles, and other close relatives. They were seen chatting and walking together after the service concluded.It was the first time the brothers had been together in public since Harry stood down from royal duties and moved to the U.S. with his wife Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, and their son Archie in early 2020.Tensions between Harry, 36, and William, 38, came to the fore after Harry and Meghan gave a revealing interview to US talk show host Oprah Winfrey last month. The couple portrayed the royal family as indifferent to Meghan’s mental health struggles, and Harry described his relationship with William as “space at the moment.”On Saturday, William and Harry walked in silence on either side of their cousin, Peter Phillips, as they joined other senior royals in Philip’s funeral procession. At one point Phillips fell behind slightly to allow the brothers to walk side by side — a visual echo of the moment the pair, as boys in 1997, walked behind the coffin of their mother Princess Diana in another royal funeral televised around the world.The brothers sat opposite each other in St. George's Chapel for the funeral, which was attended by only 30 people because of coronavirus restrictions. While William sat next to his wife Kate, Harry was on his own because Meghan is pregnant with their second child and was advised by her doctor not to make the long trip.Afterwards, Harry, William and Kate strolled together outside the chapel. Moments later, the brothers walked together alone while Kate spoke to Zara Tindall, another of Queen Elizabeth II's eight grandchildren who is William and Harry’s cousin.Rumors of a rift between the brothers — William, the heir, and Harry, the “spare” — have rumbled at least since 2019. That's when Harry and Meghan separated from the Royal Foundation, originally set up as the brothers’ joint charitable venture, to set up their own platform. That year, Harry said he loved his brother dearly but they were “on different paths” and have “good days” and “bad days.”Many believe that William was angered and hurt by Harry’s decision to speak so publicly about the royal family's issues during the Winfrey interview. In one explosive allegation, they said a family member — not the queen or Philip — had expressed “concerns” about Archie's possible skin color before he was born. Meghan has a Black mother and a white father.Days after the interview aired, William insisted "we are very much not a racist family,” and said he had not spoken to Harry since the broadcast.It's unclear whether the passing of their grandfather will help the brothers heal their rift. It wasn’t immediately clear how long Harry, who has been self-isolating in line with the U.K.'s coronavirus restrictions since arriving from California early this week, will stay in his home country.Saturday's funeral was limited to only 30 people, who all had to wear masks, sit in family bubbles and remain socially distanced in the same church that had hosted hundreds of people for Harry and Meghan's royal wedding in 2018. And Britain's continued coronavirus restrictions may limit how much opportunity the brothers will get to smooth over their differences.“Because of the restrictions of COVID, it’s difficult to get down to decent conservations,” said royal biographer Penny Junor. “It’s probably quite difficult to sit down as they normally would over a beer and discuss things.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/harry-william-seen-chatting-after-prince-philip-s-funeral-101618681086104.html

17-04-2021||World||Dogecoin frenzy overloads Robinhood crypto order system||The frenzy around digital tokens is taking its zaniest turn yet in the price of a token created as a joke, buckling the crypto trading system at Robinhood Markets.Dogecoin, boosted by the likes of Elon Musk and Mark Cuban, rallied more than 110% Friday before dropping by 26% on Saturday, according to CoinMarketCap.com. It now has a market value of more than $36 billion and is still up 13,400% from a year ago, when it traded for $0.002 and was worth about $250 million.Demand was so brisk for the token that investors trying to trade it on Robinhood crashed the site, the online exchange said in a blog post Friday. Some $68 billion worth of Dogecoin changed hands in the prior 24 hours as of 4:45 p.m. Friday in New York, the most since June, CoinMarketCap.com data showed.Doge’s surge is part of a rise in altcoins, a term for all the digital tokens that have sprung up in imitation of Bitcoin. Like most of them, its use case is limited, making it a tool for speculators and raising concern that a bubble is inflating in a crypto world now worth more than $2.25 trillion.“This reminds me of the dot com days. We knew something big was going on, a lot of investors were chasing it hard. That led to a bubble,” Scott Knapp, chief market strategist at CUNA Mutual Group, said. “For every Amazon.com there were 10 pets.com that went bankrupt. Is Dogecoin the pets.com of the cryptocurrency era?”Interest in crypto is on the rise again after companies from PayPal to Square started enabling transactions in Bitcoin on their systems, and Wall Street firms like Morgan Stanley began providing access to the tokens to some of the wealthiest clients. All along, crypto die-hards who say the blockchain technology will rewire the financial community have been plugging crypto, getting rich in the process.The Shiba-Inu themed Dogecoin was created as a joke by software engineers Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer in 2013. Musk sparked a rally in it earlier this year when he posted a photo of a faux magazine “Dogue” featuring a dog in a red sweater.But Michael Novogratz, chief executive officer of Galaxy Digital Holdings, isn’t buying the hype, since Dogecoin “doesn’t really have a purpose.”“It’s reminiscent of GameStop,” he said in an interview with Bloomberg TV, referring to the meme stock mania that gripped markets in February. “I would be very, very worried if one of my friends was investing in Dogecoin at these prices.”With little to back up the case for buying cryptocurrencies, the likelihood of them cratering remains high, leaving novice traders who jumped in on the hype vulnerable to steep losses.“The government has pumped so much monetary and fiscal stimulus into the economy now, even worthless assets are being bid up,” said Michael O’Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading.Yet alt-coin popularity is hard to ignore. While Bitcoin is worth more than $1 trillion, the total market cap of the token universe now exceeds $2.25 trillion, according to CoinGecko.com, which tracks more than 6,700 coins.Bitcoin’s dominance in the crypto world has declined 28% since the beginning of the year, according to OKEX Insights Analyst Robbie Liu, citing data from Tradingview. The waning influence started to accelerate this month, he said in an email Friday, and Bitcoin now accounts for less than 54% of the crypto market capitalization -- the lowest level in nearly two years.“On the altcoins front, we continue to see strong momentum,” said Pankaj Balani, the CEO of Delta Exchange, a leading crypto derivatives exchange, in a note Thursday. He noted Ether’s recent record and increased activity in decentralized finance or DeFi, adding that “decentralized exchange coins will be in focus in the next few days, given that the market has validated Coinbase at a $100 billion valuation.”Other tokens with shaky to no fundamentals are also rising. Cardano and Polkadot, both in the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market cap, have surged this week.“Polkadot and Cardano have very few ‘users’” currently, said Shashwat Gupta, founder of Altcoinbuzz.io, in an email Wednesday, though he added that there’s a substantial amount of development being built on them.And it looks like Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong may have been on to something when he said after the listing that it marks a “shift in legitimacy” for crypto.The Coinbase listing “ultimately will deliver more ‘use cases’ for cryptos and should keep the crypto market growing,” said Edward Moya, senior market analyst for North America at Oanda Corp.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dogecoin-frenzy-overloads-robinhood-crypto-order-system-101618680815478.html

The entire royal procession and funeral took place out of public view within the grounds of the castle, a 950-year-old royal residence 20 miles (30 kilometers) west of London, but was shown live on television.Coronavirus restrictions meant that instead of the 800 mourners expected in the longstanding plans for Philip's funeral, only 30 people were allowed inside the castle's St. George’s Chapel, including the queen, her four children and her eight grandchildren.Following strict social distancing rules during the pandemic, the queen set an example even in grief, sitting apart from family members who were arrayed around the church.Prince Charles, the heir to the throne, sat opposite the monarch alongside his wife, Camilla. Prince Andrew was two seats to the queen's left. Prince William and his wife, Kate, sat directly opposite from his brother, Prince Harry, who had traveled back from California without his pregnant wife, Meghan.People across Britain observed one minute of silence in honor of Philip just before the funeral got underway. Under soft spring sunshine, some locals earlier stopped outside the castle to leave flowers, but people largely heeded requests by police and the palace not to gather because of the pandemic.Philip's coffin traveled to the chapel on a specially adapted Land Rover designed by the prince himself. The coffin was draped in his personal standard and topped with his Royal Navy cap, sword and a wreath of flowers.For the procession, senior military commanders lined up in front of the vehicle. The children of Philip and the queen — Charles, Princess Anne, Andrew and Prince Edward — walked behind the hearse, while the 94-year-old queen traveled to the chapel in a Bentley car.Grandsons Prince William and Prince Harry also walked behind the coffin, although not side by side. The brothers, whose relationship has been strained amid Harry’s decision to quit royal duties and move to California, flanked their cousin Peter Phillips, the son of Anne.For many viewers, the moment stirred memories of William and Harry at 15 and 12, walking behind the coffin of their mother, Princess Diana, in 1997, accompanied by their grandfather Philip, in a London ceremony televised around the world.Later Saturday, the two brothers were seen walking together and chatting as the mourners left the chapel after the service.The funeral reflected Philip's military ties, both as a ceremonial commander of many units and as a veteran of war. More than 700 military personnel took part, including army bands, Royal Marine buglers and an honor guard drawn from across the armed forces.Inside the Gothic chapel, the setting for centuries of royal weddings and funerals, the service was simple and somber.The ceremony began with Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby entering the chapel ahead of the coffin, followed by Philip’s children and three of his eight grandchildren, as a four-member, socially distanced choir sang “I am the resurrection and the life.”There was no sermon, at Philip’s request, and no family eulogies or readings, in keeping with royal tradition. But Dean of Windsor David Conner said the country had been enriched by Philip’s “unwavering loyalty to our queen, by his service to the nation and the Commonwealth, by his courage, fortitude and faith.”Philip spent almost 14 years in the Royal Navy and saw action in the Mediterranean Sea, the Indian Ocean and the Pacific during World War II. Several elements of his funeral had a maritime theme, including the hymn “Eternal Father, Strong to Save,” which is associated with seafarers and asks God: “O hear us when we cry to thee/For those in peril on the sea.”Leading a prayer, Conner said: “Grant unto him the assurance of thine ancient promise that thou wilt ever be with those who go down to the sea in ships and occupy their business in great waters.”As Philip’s coffin was lowered into the Royal Vault, Royal Marine buglers sounded “Action Stations,” an alarm that alerts sailors to prepare for battle. Its inclusion, after the traditional bugle call of “The Last Post,” was a personal request from Philip.Philip was placed in the vault alongside the remains of 24 other royals, including three kings of England. But it will likely not be his permanent resting place. After the queen's death, she and Philip are expected to be buried in the Royal Burial Ground on the Frogmore Estate close to Windsor Castle.Along with Philip’s children and grandchildren, the 30 funeral guests included other senior royals and several of his German relatives. Philip was born a prince of Greece and Denmark and, like the queen, is related to a thicket of European royal families.Ahead of the funeral, Buckingham Palace released a photo of the queen and Philip, smiling and relaxing on blankets in the grass in the Scottish Highlands in 2003. The palace said the casual photo was a favorite of the queen.For decades, Philip was a fixture of British life, renowned for his founding of the Duke of Edinburgh’s Awards program that encouraged youths to challenge themselves and for a blunt-spoken manner that at times included downright offensive remarks. He lived in his wife’s shadow, but his death has sparked a reflection about his role, and new appreciation from many in Britain.“He was a character, an absolute character,” said Jenny Jeeves as she looked at the floral tributes in Windsor. “He was fun, he was funny. Yes, he made quite a few gaffes, but it depends which way you took it, really. Just a wonderful husband, father, and grandfather, and a good example to all of us.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/prince-philip-laid-to-rest-as-sombre-queen-elizabeth-ii-sits-alone-101618678915308.html
17-04-2021||World||US West prepares for possible 1st water shortage declaration||The man-made lakes that store water supplying millions of people in the U.S. West and Mexico are projected to shrink to historic lows in the coming months, dropping to levels that could trigger the federal government's first-ever official shortage declaration and prompt cuts in Arizona and Nevada.The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation released 24-month projections this week forecasting that less Colorado River water will cascade down from the Rocky Mountains through Lake Powell and Lake Mead and into the arid deserts of the U.S. Southwest and the Gulf of California. Water levels in the two lakes are expected to plummet low enough for the agency to declare an official shortage for the first time, threatening the supply of Colorado River water that growing cities and farms rely on.It comes as climate change means less snowpack flows into the river and its tributaries, and hotter temperatures parch soil and cause more river water to evaporate as it streams through the drought-plagued American West.The agency’s models project Lake Mead will fall below 1,075 feet (328 meters) for the first time in June 2021. That's the level that prompts a shortage declaration under agreements negotiated by seven states that rely on Colorado River water: Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming.The April projections, however, will not have binding impact. Federal officials regularly issue long-term projections but use those released each August to make decisions about how to allocate river water. If projections don't improve by then, the Bureau of Reclamation will declare a Level 1 shortage condition. The cuts would be implemented in January.Arizona, Nevada and Mexico have voluntarily given up water under a drought contingency plan for the river signed in 2019. A shortage declaration would subject the two U.S. states to their first mandatory reductions. Both rely on the Colorado River more than any other water source, and Arizona stands to lose roughly one-third of its supply.Water agency officials say they’re confident their preparation measures, including conservation and seeking out alternative sources, would allow them to withstand cuts if the drought lingers as expected."The study, while significant, is not a surprise. It reflects the impacts of the dry and warm conditions across the Colorado River Basin this year, as well as the effects of a prolonged drought that has impacted the Colorado River water supply,” officials from the Arizona Department of Water Resources and Central Arizona Project said in a joint statement.In Nevada, the agency that supplies water to most of the state has constructed “straws” to draw water from further down in Lake Mead as its levels fall. It also has created a credit system where it can bank recycled water back into the reservoir without having it count toward its allocation.Colby Pellegrino, director of water resources for the Southern Nevada Water Authority, reassured customers that those preparation measures would insulate them from the effects of cuts. But she warned that more action was needed.“It is incumbent upon all users of the Colorado River to find ways to conserve,” Pellegrino said in a statement.The Bureau of Reclamation also projected that Lake Mead will drop to the point they worried in the past could threaten electricity generation at Hoover Dam. The hydropower serves millions of customers in Arizona, California and Nevada.To prepare for a future with less water, the bureau has spent 10 years replacing parts of five of the dam's 17 turbines that rotate to generate power. Len Schilling, a dam manager with the bureau, said the addition of wide-head turbines allow the dam to operate more efficiently at lower water levels. He said the turbines will be able to generate power almost to a point called “deadpool,” when there won't be enough water for the dam to function.But Schilling noted that less water moving through Hoover Dam means less hydropower to go around.“As the elevation declines at the lake, then our ability to produce power declines as well because we have less water pushing on the turbines," he said.The hydropower costs substantially less than the energy sold on the wholesale electricity market because the government charges customers only for the cost of producing it and maintaining the dam.Lincoln County Power District General Manager Dave Luttrell said infrastructure updates, less hydropower from Hoover Dam and supplemental power from other sources like natural gas raised costs and alarmed customers in his rural Nevada district.“Rural economies in Arizona and Nevada live and die by the hydropower that is produced at Hoover Dam. It might not be a big deal to NV Energy,” he said of Nevada's largest utility. “It might be a decimal point to Los Angeles Department of Water and Power. But for Lincoln County, it adds huge impact.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-west-prepares-for-possible-1st-water-shortage-declaration-101618678267990.html
17-04-2021||World||China carrying out drives to recruit Tibetans amid border standoff with India||China’s military has stepped up efforts to recruit more Tibetans amid the dragging border standoff with India on the Line of Actual Control (LAC), holding special recruitment drives across Tibet Autonomous Region since the beginning of the year, people familiar with developments said.People’s Liberation Army (PLA) officials have criss-crossed the Tibet Autonomous Region to hold recruitment drives and to pick up Tibetan recruits who were already at PLA camps, the people cited above said on condition of anonymity.There are also reports the PLA intends to create a Special Tibetan Army Unit, the people said, citing intelligence reports and communications intercepts from three separate intelligence agencies. If this were to go ahead, this would be the first PLA formation comprising soldiers from a specific ethnicity, the people added.PLA officials from Lhasa visited Rudok town in Ngari Prefecture in the far west of Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR) in the third week of February to recruit Tibetans as soldiers, according to an intelligence report. These officials later travelled to Zanda or Tsamda County, one of the border counties of TAR to select Tibetan recruits from several PLA camps for possible induction into the special unit, the report said.The PLA also reportedly carried out a recruitment drive in Lhasa to induct a sizeable number of Tibetans. This drive was conducted against the backdrop of the standoff in Ladakh and the PLA is expected to raise more border defence regiments comprising Tibetans, the people said.Security officials in New Delhi have been keeping a close watch on these developments, which come at a time when the disengagement process along the LAC has stalled after a limited drawdown of troops, armoured formations and artillery on the north and south banks of Pangong Lake in February.The latest meeting of senior Indian and Chinese military commanders held on April 9 ended without any forward movement on disengagement at other friction points such as Depsang, Hot Springs and Gogra, though the two sides agreed to maintain stability on the ground and avoid any new incidents.“These new recruitment drives are being held at a time when there are reports that mainstream Chinese troops from lower altitudes faced problems during their deployment in Tibet. We have intercepts showing their troops suffered from health problems such as severe mountain sickness and high altitude pulmonary oedema,” said an official.“It is also meant to send a message to India and to Tibetans in India,” the official added.According to reports in the PLA Daily, China’s military has been introducing guidelines to prevent troops serving on the Tibetan plateau from getting altitude sickness. “Altitude sickness is a common problem that has been affecting troops stationed on the plateau for a long time,” an unnamed army officer was quoted as saying by PLA Daily.Last August, India deployed the Special Frontier Force (SFF), a secret paramilitary force comprising ethnic Tibetans, for an operation to take over strategic heights on the south bank of Pangong Lake. A Tibetan soldier was killed in a landmine blast during the operation and senior Indian officials attended his funeral – the first acknowledgement of the SFF being used along the LAC and a move seen as a signal to China.The people said the special recruitment drives are meant to induct Tibetans into the PLA and not the Tibetan militia units, which play a role in patrolling, logistics and transporting supplies using mules and horses. These militia units specialise in operating at high altitudes and their training too has been intensified since last year, according to reports in China’s state media.The special recruitment drives for Tibetans also come in the wake of informal efforts by the Chinese side last year to forge a special relationship with the Nepali Army on the lines of its relationship with the Indian Army. The Nepal Army chief is an honorary chief of the Indian Army and the same honour is conferred by the other side and Nepalese Gurkha soldiers serve in the Indian Army.“The Chinese side made an informal proposal in this regard, hoping it could open the doors for possible recruitment of Gurkha soldiers but it was rebuffed,” said a person familiar with developments.A second person confirmed the matter and said the moves in Nepal and Tibet were aimed at opening new fronts against India.According to China’s official statistics from 2010, there were 2.1 million Han servicemen, compared to 4,300 Tibetans. More recent figures aren’t readily available.India-based Tibet specialist Claude Arpi said altitude sickness or lack of oxygen has been an issue with the PLA. Unlike Indian soldiers, most PLA soldiers aren’t trained enough to acclimatise to high altitude, and only local Tibetan scouts may be accustomed to such altitudes, he said.“There have been repeated articles in Chinese state media on the oxygen issue,” Arpi said, adding that on the Indian side, troops drawn from Ladakh or ethnic Tibetans are more accustomed to high altitudes and genetically face fewer problems.Given the secrecy with which PLA functions, there is little evidence in the open of China putting together a single ethnicity-based unit but the incidence of altitude sickness among border soldiers could be one reason why the PLA would want to recruit more Tibetans.From the propaganda aspect, recruitment of Tibetans would be interesting as TAR will celebrate its 70th anniversary of what Beijing calls the “peaceful liberation” this year, Arpi said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pla-conducting-special-drives-to-recruit-more-tibetans-amid-lac-standoff-101618677562088.html
17-04-2021||World||5 killed in Bangladesh after police open fire at Chinese joint venture||At least five people were killed and several others left injured in a clash between police and workers on Saturday at a Chinese joint venture coal-fired plant in Banshkhali of Bangladesh's Chittagong region, said police. The workers had been protesting against the authorities since Friday over non-payment of dues and flexibility in work hours to let them perform Islamic rituals during the month of Ramzan.The eyewitnesses said that a Chinese supervisor even kicked the workers who were offering Namaz the previous day. The agitated workers attacked the power plant when a meeting between their leaders and the management failed to resolve the crisis. According to the eyewitnesses, the workers set a fire inside the power plant.Chittagong Range Deputy Inspector General Anwar Hossain said that police were attacked when they tried to intervene, compelling them to open fire on the workers. Banshkhali Police Station OC (investigation) Azizul Islam confirmed that five people died in the clash, adding that six police personnel were also injured. While four people died on the spot, one succumbed to injuries after he was admitted to Chattogram Medical College Hospital.The five dead workers have been identified as Rony Hossain, Mohammad Rahat, Shuvo, Mahmud Reza, and Raihan.The under-construction power plant in Banshkhali has been marred with controversy ever since the S. Alam Group, a leading Bangladeshi industrial conglomerate, signed a joint venture agreement with two Chinese companies for the 1224 MW power project. The Chinese companies are working as engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) contractors for the plant.In 2016, four people lost their lives during a clash after locals protested against S. Alam Group’s acquisition of land in the West Boroghona area for plant’s construction. The S. Alam Group paid a penalty of 2 billion Takas to keep the controversial project alive. The plant was scheduled to start supplying electricity to the national grid from November 2019 but controversies surrounding the project have jeopardised the progress.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/5-killed-in-bangladesh-after-police-open-fire-at-chinese-joint-venture-101618671782068.html

"However, in these videos, Phelps also made statements about killing Vice President Harris."In one of the videos, "Phelps stated: 'Kamala Harris you are going to die. Your days are numbered already," added the complaint.In another video on February 18, Phelps stated, "I'm going to the gun range. ... I swear to God, today is your day you're gonna die. 50 days from today, mark this day down."Phelps expressed how she believes Harris not actually 'Black' and how during inauguration she disrespectfully put her hand on her clutch purse instead of the Bible.The complaint said investigators also found a photo that showed Phelps at a shooting range, holding a pistol and smiling next to a target with bullet holes.She also applied for a concealed weapons permit in February, the complaint said.On March 3, the Secret Service and detectives from the Miami-Dade Police Department went to Phelps' residence to interview her, but she refused to speak with them at the time, according to the complaint.On March 6, a Secret Service agent went to speak with Phelps at her home. According to the complaint, Phelps said, "She was angry at the time about Kamala Harris becoming Vice President but that she is 'over it now.'||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kamala-harris-you-are-going-to-die-florida-woman-charged-over-alleged-threats-101618671472976.html

The Interfax news agency earlier cited the FSB as saying Oleksandr Sosoniuk was taken into custody when he tried to obtain classified information from Russian law enforcement databases during a meeting with a Russian citizen.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-beefs-up-warship-presence-in-black-sea-as-ukraine-tensions-simmer-101618662958101.html

17-04-2021||World||Pressure mounts for German Chancellor Merkel's bloc to end its power struggle||Pressure mounted Saturday on the two contenders hoping to lead German Chancellor Angela Merkel's center-right bloc into September's national election to end their power struggle and agree which of them will run to succeed her.Armin Laschet, the leader of Merkel's Christian Democratic Union, and Markus Soeder, the head of its smaller Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union, have both declared their interest in running for chancellor.Germany’s parliamentary election Sept. 26 will determine who succeeds Merkel, who isn’t seeking a fifth term after nearly 16 years in power.Laschet and Soeder are the governors of Germany’s two most populous states, North Rhine-Westphalia and Bavaria respectively. Soeder has much better poll ratings, but Laschet is the recently elected leader of the political party that is by far the largest one.On Monday, Laschet rallied the CDU leadership behind his bid and called for a quick decision. But Soeder said the matter shouldn't be resolved “only in a small back room,” pointing to his superior poll ratings — angering many in the CDU.On Tuesday, the two contenders appeared at a closed-door meeting of the Union bloc's joint parliamentary group in Berlin that, according to German media reports, laid bare the divisions in the CDU. They held out the prospect of a decision by the end of the week.There has been little sign of movement since, but mounting calls for a decision amid fears that the power struggle could do significant damage.Defense Minister Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, Laschet's predecessor as CDU leader, appealed Saturday for Laschet and Soeder to come to an agreement.“No one can relieve them of this leadership responsibility,” she said, according to the dpa news agency.Friedrich Merz, whom Laschet defeated in January to become the party leader, said: “Reach an agreement, Markus Soeder and Armin Laschet. This country needs prospects. This country needs leadership.”The center-left Social Democrats nominated Finance Minister Olaf Scholz as their candidate for chancellor months ago. The environmentalist Greens are to announce Monday which of their co-leaders, Annalena Baerbock and Robert Habeck, will make their first run for the chancellery.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pressure-mounts-for-german-chancellor-merkel-s-bloc-to-end-its-power-struggle-101618668873025.html
17-04-2021||World||Iran nuclear talks set to resume in Vienna||Talks on Iran's nuclear programme aimed at salvaging a 2015 nuclear deal were set to resume Saturday, a day after Tehran said it had started producing uranium at 60 percent purity.The Islamic republic had declared it would sharply ramp up its enrichment of uranium earlier this week, after an attack on its Natanz nuclear facility that it blamed on arch-foe Israel.The incidents cast a shadow over talks in Vienna aimed at rescuing the nuclear agreement between Iran and world powers that then US president Donald Trump abandoned almost three years ago.The European Union said Saturday's talks would involve EU officials and representatives from Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia and Iran.The talks are aimed at determining which sanctions the United States should lift and the measures Iran has to take to come into compliance with the accord.The Russian ambassador to Vienna, Mikhail Ulyanov, spoke of "slow but steady progress in the negotiations on restoration of the nuclear deal" on Twitter.Ali Akbar Salehi, head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, confirmed Iran was now producing uranium enriched to 60 percent purity, taking the country closer to the 90 percent level required for use in a nuclear weapon."The enrichment of uranium to 60 percent is underway" in Natanz, he said, quoted by Tasnim news agency.Iran has repeatedly insisted it is not seeking an atomic bomb, but at that rate of production, it could take the Islamic republic 322 days to produce the amount of 60 percent enriched uranium needed to make one bomb, based on the International Atomic Energy Agency's (IAEA) criteria.But this would require Iran to have a sufficient amount of 20 percent enriched uranium, which it does not have, according to the latest IAEA data.Tehran has gradually rolled back its nuclear commitments since 2019, a year after Washington withdrew from the accord and began imposing sanctions.The 2015 deal, known formally as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), gave Iran relief from sanctions in return for curbs on its nuclear programme.Under the accord, Iran had committed to keep enrichment to 3.67 percent, though it had stepped this up to 20 percent in January.Negotiations aimed at ensuring the return of the United States to the JCPOA and the lifting of sanctions resumed this week in Vienna.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-nuclear-talks-set-to-resume-in-vienna-101618667555769.html

17-04-2021||World||‘More aggressive’: Brazil asks women to delay pregnancy ‘if possible’ over coronavirus variant||Brazil has asked women to postpone pregnancy “if possible”, saying the variants of coronavirus have been more aggressive in pregnant women, according to CNN. Raphael Camara, secretary of primary health care of the Brazilian health ministry, told a news conference that women should consider delaying pregnancy “a bit to a better time so that (they) can have a more peaceful pregnancy.""We cannot say this to those who are 42, 43 years old, of course, but for a young woman who can, the best thing is to wait for a little," Camara was quoted by CNN as saying.Brazil is the second worst-hit country in terms of deaths related to coronavirus disease (Covid-19) and a team of public health experts warned this week that the Latin American nation could be head for even worse times because of a “dangerous combination of inaction and wrongdoing.” Brazil has so far reported more than 368,000 deaths related to Covid-19, according to Johns Hopkins University.Camara said that although the ministry is still working on the studies related to pregnancy and coronavirus variants, “the clinical view of experts shows that the new variant has a more aggressive action on pregnant women”, per CNN. “Before, [severity] was linked to the end of the pregnancy, but now (they) see a more serious evolution in the second trimester and even in the first trimester," he added.In a report published in the journal Science, a team of researchers highlighted the factors behind the worsening situation in Brazil, including the promotion of chloroquine as treatment despite a lack of evidence and lack of coordinated national strategy. The report was authored by Marcia Castro of the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health, experts at the University of São Paulo and elsewhere.The variant of concern (VOC), P.1, first emerged in the Brazilian city of Manaus is estimated to be 1.4-2.2 times more transmissible, with the ability to evade immunity from previous non-P.1 infection, according to a modelling study. Researchers at the University of São Paulo, in collaboration with Imperial College London and the University of Oxford, recently estimated that the P.1 variant evades 25-61% of protective immunity arising from infection with previously circulating variants.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brazil-asks-women-to-postpone-pregnancy-if-possible-over-coronavirus-variant-101618662883059.html
17-04-2021||World||Hong Kong: 81 tenants of a building quarantined after mutant strain detected||Hong Kong health officials quarantined 81 residents of a building in a densely populated neighborhood after a man who had traveled to the city from Dubai initially tested positive for a highly transmissible mutant strain of Covid-19 -- the first time the variant has been detected in the city.Health authorities locked down the Parkes Building in the Jordan area of the Kowloon district to conduct mandatory testing and have ordered compulsory screening for those who have visited the building or come into contact with the patient, according to the government.The asymptomatic 29-year-old man stayed with a friend in the building after serving the mandatory 21-day quarantine period at a hotel, during which time he tested negative for the virus a number of times. Authorities are trying to establish whether he contracted the virus in Dubai where he works, on the flight or in Hong Kong.“This case is very worrisome,” Chuang Shuk-kwan, head of the communicable disease branch of the Hong Kong health department, said at a briefing on Saturday. “We can’t rule out the possibility that he contracted it from the community. We have never identified a local case with the variant.”Covid Claims 3 Million Lives as Burden Shifts to Poorer NationsThe preliminary test result from the confirmed case involved the N501Y mutant strain of the coronavirus, which is highly transmissible, she said. The building is “relatively old” and houses some sub-divided units, according to a government statement.Asymptomatic residents in the 48 units on all 11 floors were transferred to quarantine centers, while those with symptoms were hospitalized, according to the statement. Authorities also ordered compulsory testing for anyone who had visited the building for more than two hours in the eight days since April 9.Hong Kong reported 18 new confirmed cases on Saturday, eight of which were locally transmitted and the source of six of those was untraceable.“Given the possible resurgence of cases, we need to be vigilant and we urge everyone to get vaccinated as soon as possible,” Ronald Lam, controller of the Centre for Health Protection, said at the briefing.As of late Friday, the city had reported a total of 11,635 Covid-19 cases and 209 deaths. Hong Kong has administered more than 1 million doses of vaccine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-81-tenants-of-a-building-quarantined-after-mutant-strain-detected-101618657672367.html
17-04-2021||World||Expert warns ‘double mutant’ variant could derail UK’s ‘escape plan’, says no travel ban on India 'mystifying'||Amid a massive surge in coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases in India, a leading scientist has warned that the emergence of double mutation variant could detail Britain’s roadmap out of the lockdown. The British government is expected to lift all coronavirus-induced restrictions by June 21 as nearly half of the population has so far received at least one dose of authorised Covid-19 vaccines.Danny Altmann, an immunology professor at Imperial College, told BBC that the UK should be on its guard against another wave of infections after 77 cases of the B.1.617 variant, which was first detected in India, were found. The new strain with two mutations, the E484Q and L452R, is thought to be driving India’s new wave of infections that has made it the second worst-hit country, surpassing Brazil."I think we should be terribly concerned about it," Altmann told BBC News. “They (variants of concern) are things that can most scupper our escape plan at the moment and give us a third wave. They are a worry,” he added.However, the Public Health England (PHE) has currently designated the new strain as a variant under investigation (VUI) and not as a variant of concern (VOC). The UK has also not placed India on its “red list”, which means incoming travellers from India won’t be required to quarantine in a government-approved hotel for 10 days.Also Read | India is fighting double mutant virus variant. Should we worry?Altmann said he found it “mystifying” and “slightly confounding” that travellers from India were not required to stay in a hotel. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson is due to visit India later this month, which has reportedly been shortened because of the Covid-19 situation in the country.Apart from the UK, the double mutation has been detected in countries like the US, Australia, New Zealand, Germany, Singapore, Belgium, and Ireland, according to a statement released by India’s ministry of health and family welfare. “Higher transmissibility of this variant is not established as yet,” the ministry said.Paul Hunter, professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia, said that there’s laboratory evidence that the variant has two ‘escape mutations’, which makes it easier for the virus to slip past antibodies.“Basically, applying what we know about other human coronaviruses would suggest that this is going to be even less controlled by vaccine,” Hunter told ITV. “But we don't know that for certain at the moment,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-double-mutant-variant-could-derail-uk-s-escape-plan-warns-expert-101618655206673.html

The fire has been contained but the hospital has been closed for seven days, said David Makhura, premier of Gauteng province where Johannesburg is located.Four hundred patients have already been moved to other public hospitals in the metropolitan area and an additional 270 patients will be moved y the end of Saturday, Makhura said.Early Saturday morning the fire caused the third floor of the hospital’s parking garage to collapse.Sixty firefighters have been battling the blaze through the night. The fire started Friday morning and had been doused by the afternoon but then it reignited in the evening and continued burning overnight.The fire has caused extensive damage to the hospital, which has more than 1,000 beds and serves Johannesburg, a city of 6 million people, and the surrounding Gauteng province. It is one of the biggest public hospitals in the country.It is also a designated treatment center for Covid-19 in Gauteng. According to Makhura, the hospital had 13 Covid-19 patients, two in ICU and 11 in general wards at the time of the fire. They have all been transferred to other hospitals.“The fire has been contained into some areas. We are shutting down the hospital as a precautionary measure because there is a lot of smoke that went into other areas, including wards," said Makhura.The fire started in a storeroom for dry surgical supplies, according to officials.Firefighters reported that the blaze re-started from smoldering medical supplies, including supplies of personal protective equipment used by staff treating patients with Covid-19, Makhura said. An investigation into the fire will be launched, he said.“Our firefighters have been receiving help from others in neighboring municipalities. It has been a tedious process trying to move patients. At first, we moved them to wards that were far away from the fire but we started to evacuate them,” said Gauteng health spokeswoman Kwara Kekana. “That is still a process that is ongoing, we are now referring all patients to other hospitals.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fire-breaks-out-at-johannesburg-hospital-nearly-700-patients-being-evacuated-101618655976688.html

It showed a passport-style photograph of a man it identified as Karimi, saying he was born in the nearby city of Kashan, Iran.The report did not elaborate how Karimi would have gotten access to one of the most secure facilities in the Islamic Republic.The report also aired what appeared to be an Interpol “red notice” seeking his arrest. The arrest notice was not immediately accessible on Interpol's public-facing database. Interpol, based in Lyon, France, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The TV report said “necessary actions” are underway to bring him back to Iran through legal channels, without elaborating. The supposed Interpol “red notice” listed his travel history as including Spain, the United Arab Emirates, Kenya, Ethiopia, Qatar, Turkey, Uganda, Romania and another country that was illegible.The report also showed centrifuges in a hall, as well as what appeared to be caution tape up at the Natanz facility.The attack Sunday, suspected to have been carried out by Israel, has inflamed a shadow war between the two nations. Iran has begun enriching a small amount of uranium up to 60% purity — its highest level ever — in response amid talks in Vienna aimed at saving its tattered nuclear deal with world powers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-names-suspect-in-natanz-nuclear-facility-attack-says-he-fled-country-101618655068225.html
17-04-2021||World||US Sikh group demands probe of possible hate bias in Indianapolis FedEx shooting||Half of the eight workers shot to death at an Indianapolis FedEx facility by a former employee before he killed himself belonged to the Sikh religious community, leading an advocacy group to urge a probe of possible racial or ethnic hatred as a factor.Law enforcement officials said Friday they have yet to determine what motivated the gunman, 19-year-old Brandon Hole, who was white, to carry out Thursday night's rampage, at a FedEx operations center near Indianapolis International Airport.The attack in Indiana's state capital, the third most populous city in the Midwest, was the latest in a spate of at least seven deadly mass shootings in the United States over the past month.It came a little over a year after Hole was briefly placed under psychiatric detention by police when his mother reported her concerns that he was contemplating "suicide by cop," according to the FBI. A shotgun was seized from his home.FBI agents who interviewed the teenager last April found no criminal violation at the time and determined he possessed no "racially motivated violent extremism ideology," said Paul Keenan, special agent in charge of the FBI's Indianapolis field office.But the New York-based Sikh Coalition, a civil rights advocacy group, called for a full investigation into "the possibility of bias as factor" in the FedEx killings.Four members of the Sikh faith - three women and a man - were among the dead in Thursday night's shooting spree, and at least one Sikh individual was wounded, said Gurinder Singh Khalsa, a businessman and leader of the local Sikh community who said he was briefed by victims' families.Singh Khalsa also told Reuters the majority of employees at the FedEx site are Sikhs, whose religion originated in the Punjab region of the Indian subcontinent.He said the FedEx center was known for hiring older members of the local Sikh community who did not necessarily speak fluent English.The Sikh Coalition's executive director, Satjeet Kaur, said more than 8,000 Sikh-Americans live in Indiana.SPATE OF VIOLENCEThe recent surge in U.S. mass gun violence began on March 16 when a gunman shot eight people to death, including six Asian woman, at three Atlanta-area day spas before he was arrested.That rampage heightened tensions already brewing over a rise in hate crimes and discrimination directed at Asian Americans in recent years, stoked in part by racially inflammatory rhetoric about the coronavirus pandemic's origins in China.Since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States perpetrated by the Islamist militant group al Qaeda, Sikh men have sometimes been confused publicly with Muslims because they wear turbans with their hair and beards uncut.The eight people killed in Thursday night's violence ranged in age from 19 to 74. The shooting lasted only a couple of minutes and was over by the time police responded to the scene, Craig McCartt, the Indianapolis police department's deputy chief, said on Friday.Witnesses described a chaotic attack, as the gunman opened fire with a rifle in the parking lot before entering the facility and continuing to shoot, leaving victims both inside and outside the building. Officers found the suspect dead of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound.McCartt told reporters the suspect was believed to have last worked at the plant in the fall of 2020.Asked what brought him back to the facility on Thursday night, McCartt replied: "I wish I could answer that."Neither authorities nor FedEx officials would say what ended Hole's employment at FedEx.(Reporting by Mark Hosenball in Washington, Alexandra Ulmer in San Francisco, Maria Caspani, Joseph Ax and Barbara Goldberg in New York, and Shubham Kalia and Kanishka Singh in Bengaluru, India.

Alam Group, does not meet environmental impact standards and was built without public consultation.It is one of the biggest investments made by Chinese companies in Bangladesh. The deal was one of many announced when President Xi Jinping visited in 2016.S.

17-04-2021||World||'They said they'd protect me': French nationals refuse embassy call to leave Pak||The French community in Pakistan is torn between disbelief, fear and annoyance in reaction to their embassy's call for them to leave the country after Francophobic rioting this week by an extremist Islamic party.Most, it seems, have decided to stay put.In a terse three-line email, accompanied by the words "urgent", the embassy in Islamabad on Thursday recommended its nationals and French companies temporarily leave Pakistan, because of "serious threats".The email, which did not specify the nature of the risks, caused shock and consternation among the few hundred-strong French community.Jean-Michel Quarantotti, who has taught French at the American school in Islamabad for three years, was first alerted to the embassy advisory by a student."I won't hide from you that at first I felt a little bit of fear, panic," he told AFP."It's not my first foreign country -- I did a lot before arriving in Pakistan -- but I was really shocked. I didn't expect to go through this."His first thought was to pack up and leave, but after discussing the situation with colleagues he said reason took over from emotion."The Pakistanis around me advised me to stay," he said. "They told me that they would protect me."It was very touching to see the solidarity around me, from people who told me: 'We are here for you, do not worry, we will defend you'."The embassy announcement came after days of violent protests orchestrated by the radical Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) after the arrest in Lahore Monday of leader Saad Rizvi, who had called for a march on the capital to demand the expulsion of the French ambassador.Four policemen were killed in the rioting.The TLP has been behind several anti-France rallies since President Emmanuel Macron defended the right of Charlie Hebdo magazine to repupublish cartoons depicting the Prophet Muhammad -- an act deemed blasphemous by many Muslims.'Highs and lows'Many of the French people contacted by AFP questioned the timing of the embassy's message as the Pakistani government had just announced the ban on the TLP and seemed to have the situation under control."Yes, there are a lot of risks to live here," said Quarantotti, "but we don't need to panic the French community with words that are badly chosen."We wonder a little why France needed to publicise this message at the international level, when it could have given a much more discreet message to the (French) community".Fellow national Julien -- an assumed name because he does not wish to divulge his identity -- has also chosen to stay put."It's a recommendation, so I won't leave," he told AFP.He also refused his employer's offer to repatriate him to Europe or put armed guards outside his home."Anyway, since October, November, it's been all ups and downs. So we'll wait for it to calm down," the Islamabad resident said."The watchword is vigilance," added Laurent Cinot, a consultant for the World Bank who arrived in the capital less than two months ago.He said any threat was not from ordinary Pakistanis, but only the TLP.Another Frenchman living in Lahore -- who is not allowed to give his name or that of his French company for security reasons -- has spent nearly ten years in Pakistan in two stints."Since I've been here a long time, I didn't really panic," he said.Still, he is the only French national contacted by AFP who will leave -- on the orders of his employers.For Cinot, the embassy message will have the unfortunate effect of sending back another very negative picture of Pakistan to France."It does not deserve it because, honestly, it is a magnificent country with people who are quite fascinating and kind... extremely kind," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/they-said-they-d-protect-me-french-nationals-refuse-embassy-call-to-leave-pak-101618651418576.html
17-04-2021||World||Global fatalities due to Covid-19 cross 3 million-mark: Report||The global death toll from the coronavirus topped a staggering 3 million people Saturday amid repeated setbacks in the worldwide vaccination campaign and a deepening crisis in places such as Brazil, India and France.The number of lives lost, as compiled by Johns Hopkins University, is about equal to the population of Kyiv, Ukraine; Caracas, Venezuela; or metropolitan Lisbon, Portugal. It is bigger than Chicago (2.7 million) and equivalent to Philadelphia and Dallas combined.And the true number is believed to be significantly higher because of possible government concealment and the many cases overlooked in the early stages of the outbreak that began in Wuhan, China, at the end of 2019.When the world back in January passed the bleak threshold of 2 million deaths, immunization drives had just started in Europe and the United States. Today, they are underway in more than 190 countries, though progress in bringing the virus under control varies widely.While the campaigns in the US and Britain have hit their stride and people and businesses there are beginning to contemplate life after the pandemic, other places, mostly poorer countries but some rich ones as well, are lagging behind in putting shots in arms and have imposed new lockdowns and other restrictions as virus cases soar.Worldwide, deaths are on the rise again, running at around 12,000 per day on average, and new cases are climbing too, eclipsing 700,000 a day.“This is not the situation we want to be in 16 months into a pandemic, where we have proven control measures,” said Maria Van Kerkhove, one of the World Health Organization’s leaders on Covid-19.In Brazil, where deaths are running at about 3,000 per day, accounting for one-quarter of the lives lost worldwide in recent weeks, the crisis has been likened to a “raging inferno” by one WHO official. A more contagious variant of the virus has been rampaging across the country.As cases surge, hospitals are running out of critical sedatives. As a result, there have been reports of some doctors diluting what supplies remain and even tying patients to their beds while breathing tubes are pushed down their throats.The slow vaccine rollout has crushed Brazilians’ pride in their own history of carrying out huge immunization campaigns that were the envy of the developing world.Taking cues from President Jair Bolsonaro, who has likened the virus to little more than a flu, his Health Ministry for months bet big on a single vaccine, ignoring other producers. When bottlenecks emerged, it was too late to get large quantities in time.Watching so many patients suffer and die alone at her Rio de Janeiro hospital impelled nurse Lidiane Melo to take desperate measures.In the early days of the pandemic, as sufferers were calling out for comfort that she was too busy to provide, Melo filled two rubber gloves with warm water, knotted them shut, and sandwiched them around a patient’s hand to simulate a loving touch.Some have christened the practice the “hand of God,” and it is now the searing image of a nation roiled by a medical emergency with no end in sight.“Patients can’t receive visitors. Sadly, there’s no way. So it’s a way to provide psychological support, to be there together with the patient holding their hand,” Melo said. She added: “And this year it’s worse, the seriousness of patients is 1,000 times greater.”This situation is similarly dire in India, where cases spiked in February after weeks of steady decline, taking authorities by surprise. In a surge driven by variants of the virus, India saw over 180,000 new infections in one 24-hour span during the past week, bringing the total number of cases to over 13.9 million.Problems that India had overcome last year are coming back to haunt health officials. Only 178 ventilators were free Wednesday afternoon in New Delhi, a city of 29 million, where 13,000 new infections were reported the previous day.The challenges facing India reverberate beyond its borders since the country is the biggest supplier of shots to COVAX, the UN-sponsored program to distribute vaccines to poorer parts of the world. Last month, India said it would suspend vaccine exports until the virus’s spread inside the country slows.The WHO recently described the supply situation as precarious. Up to 60 countries might not receive any more shots until June, by one estimate. To date, COVAX has delivered about 40 million doses to more than 100 countries, enough to cover barely 0.25% of the world’s population.Globally, about 87% of the 700 million doses dispensed have been given out in rich countries. While 1 in 4 people in wealthy nations have received a vaccine, in poor countries the figure is 1 in more than 500.In recent days, the US and some European countries put the use of Johnson & Johnson’s Covid-19 vaccine on hold while authorities investigate extremely rare but dangerous blood clots. AstraZeneca’s vaccine has likewise been hit with delays and restrictions because of a clotting scare.Another concern: Poorer countries are relying on vaccines made by China and Russia, which some scientists believe provide less protection that those by Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca.Last week, the director of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention acknowledged the country’s vaccines offer low protection and said officials are considering mixing them with other shots to improve their effectiveness.In the US, where over 560,000 lives have been lost, accounting for more than 1 in 6 of the world’s Covid-19 deaths, hospitalizations and deaths have dropped, businesses are reopening, and life is beginning to return to something approaching normalcy in several states. The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits tumbled last week to 576,000, a post-Covid-19 low.But progress has been patchy, and new hot spots — most notably Michigan — have flared up in recent weeks. Still, deaths in the US are down to about 700 per day on average, plummeting from a mid-January peak of about 3,400.In Europe, countries are feeling the brunt of a more contagious variant that first ravaged Britain and has pushed the continent’s Covid-19-related death toll beyond 1 million.Close to 6,000 gravely ill patients are being treated in French critical care units, numbers not seen since the first wave a year ago.Dr. Marc Leone, head of intensive care at the North Hospital in Marseille, said exhausted front-line staff members who were feted as heroes at the start of the pandemic now feel alone and are clinging to hope that renewed school closings and other restrictions will help curb the virus in the coming weeks.“There’s exhaustion, more bad tempers. You have to tread carefully because there are a lot of conflicts,” he said. “We’ll give everything we have to get through these 15 days as best we can.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/global-fatalities-due-to-covid-19-cross-3-million-mark-report-101618650714316.html
17-04-2021||World||Royal funerals: A very public affair with pomp, pageantry and sometimes privacy||With a limited guest list, social distancing, and a congregation in facemasks due to coronavirus guidelines, Prince Philip's funeral on Saturday will be a royal funeral like no other.Major send-offs for senior royals since World War II have tended to be very public affairs, with pomp, pageantry and popular fervour.1952: King George VIOn February 6, 1952, King George VI died suddenly after a long illness at the age of 56.At his funeral on February 15, his coffin was carried to Paddington station in west London on a gun carriage from Westminster Hall at the Palace of Westminster, where he lay in state.It was then transported to St George's Chapel in Windsor where he was laid to rest.A silent crowd lined the route along London's foggy streets during the three-hour procession. Big Ben rang out 56 times to mark the age of the king.His eldest daughter, who at the age of 25 had become Queen Elizabeth II, followed in a horse-drawn coach.A year later on March 24, George's mother, the dowager Queen Mary, died aged 85. Over two days, 120,000 people paid homage at Westminster.1979: Lord MountbattenOn August 27, 1979, Louis Mountbatten, the Queen's cousin and last viceroy of India, was killed at the age of 79, by an IRA bomb placed on his boat.The assassination rocked the United Kingdom. Mountbatten was a decorated naval commander, the uncle of Philip, and mentor of his eldest son, Charles, Prince of Wales.On September 5, hundreds of thousands of people gathered in London along with representatives of the British armed forces, US Marines and French, Canadian, Indian and Burmese soldiers to pay him a solemn farewell.After the service at Westminster Abbey, an escort of six tanks took the coffin to Waterloo station where it was then taken to Romsey, near Southampton, southern England, for burial at the town's abbey.1997: Princess DianaOn September 6, 1997, the country came to a standstill for the funeral of Diana, Princess of Wales, who died in Paris on August 31 in a car crash aged 36.Her death sent shockwaves around the world. Millions of people lined the streets and an estimated 2.5 billion people watched the service on television.When the procession passed Buckingham Palace, Queen Elizabeth II, who had been criticised for her stand-offish initial reaction to the death of the former wife of Prince Charles, publicly bowed her head.Her young sons, princes William and Harry, walked, heads bowed, behind their mother's coffin.Elton John sang his reworked hit "Candle in the Wind" at the Westminster Abbey service. Diana's brother Charles Spencer rebuked the royal family in his eulogy.Diana was buried at Althorp, the family's historic home in Northamptonshire, on an island in the middle of a lake.2002: Princess MargaretLed by Queen Elizabeth II's frail 101-year-old mother, also called Elizabeth, the royal family on February 15, 2002 buried the monarch's younger sister Princess Margaret, who had died six days earlier aged 71 after a series of strokes.The private funeral was attended by some 450 family and friends, including 30 or so members of the royal family such as the Queen, Margaret's ex-husband Lord Snowdon, and her two children Viscount Linley and Lady Sarah Chatto.Despite concerns over her own health, the Queen Mother attended the sombre service at St George's Chapel in Windsor Castle.It was exactly 50 years since she buried her husband, King George VI. In a break with royal tradition, Margaret was cremated.2002: Queen Elizabeth the Queen MotherJust seven weeks after Margaret, Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother died in her sleep on March 30 at Windsor. Her funeral on April 9 marked the end of an era.The royal matriarch was the last empress consort of India and a link to a bygone age. She was much loved as a symbol of resistance to the Nazi enemy during World War II.Over four days, more than 200,000 people filed past her coffin paying their respects.The funeral at Westminster Abbey was attended by more than 2,000 people, including monarchs and representatives from numerous countries.The abbey's tenor bell chimed for 101 minutes to mark every year of the Queen Mother's life.More than a million people lined the 37-kilometre-(23-mile) route taken by the funeral procession to Windsor.She was interred with her husband at the King George VI memorial chapel, where Margaret's ashes also lie.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/royal-funerals-a-very-public-affair-with-pomp-pageantry-and-sometimes-privacy-101618650934924.html
17-04-2021||World||Vaccinated nations fear quick reopening, hurt hopes of aviation revival||Countries that have quickly rolled out coronavirus vaccines are only cautiously reopening for international travel, a sign it will take time for a hoped-for rebound in air traffic to develop.UK airline capacity remains stuck at about one-tenth of 2019 levels, as the government weighs a May 17 target to restart international travel. Israel, where almost 55% of the population has been fully vaccinated, is preparing to welcome visitors in groups from May 23 if they can show they’ve had the jab.Decision makers face a tough balancing act. A second summer in a row without significant air travel would deal a major setback to an already struggling aviation industry, and also to hotels, shops and restaurants that rely on tourism. Meanwhile, there are concerns that premature reopenings will help spread newer strains of the coronavirus and undermine progress toward slowing the spread of the disease.The US may provide a test case. The country has struggled to keep infection rates down, even as a powerful vaccination campaign gathers pace. While international trips to most destinations are still off-limits, domestic capacity is ramping up, with airlines planning to add flights in coming weeks.Chile is already in full retreat. The Latin American country secured supplies from China’s Sinovac Biotech Ltd. and has fully vaccinated more than a quarter of its population. After reopening for air travel in November, it has now backtracked, closing its borders to most this month in response to a spike in Covid-19 cases.Cautious ApproachIn the UK, about half the population has received at least one dose. The government, determined to protect hard-won success bringing down infection rates, has said it’ll look at the data early next month on which countries should be green-listed in its traffic-light system, before making a final decision on the May 17 target to lift the ban on non-essential travel.Airlines have clamored for Britain to lead the way toward a reopening in the region. Wizz Air Holdings Plc Chief Executive Officer Jozsef Varadi said this week that he was no longer counting on a rebound in European air travel during this summer’s high season, citing travel restrictions and problems with vaccine rollouts.Israel has led the world in vaccinations, and while eager to restart tourism, the government has said it will reopen only in stages starting May 23. Groups will go first because they’re easier to monitor, according to Haaretz. No date has been set to allow individual travelers, and health officials will be monitoring infection rates before making a decision.Holding PatternThe nearby United Arab Emirates has remained open to air travel for months, while focusing on rapid vaccinations. Yet its long-distance hubs in Dubai and Abu Dhabi are hovering at about 50% of capacity, dependent on big countries in Europe and Asia to lift curbs.Asia has generally relied on social-distancing measures to keep infection rates low. Singapore has one of the highest vaccination rates in the region, with about 20% of its population receiving at least one dose. Visits from low-risk countries like New Zealand are allowed in certain circumstances. Under one program, business visitors stay in a confined zone near Changi Airport and conduct meetings with locals through a glass wall.Dominant Singapore Airlines Ltd. has been hit hard by travel restrictions because the city-state has no local aviation market. The government is in talks with several countries to set up air travel bubbles, including Hong Kong and Australia.Hungary has administered at least a first vaccine dose to more than 30% of its population. Still, daily infection levels remain elevated, and virus mortality is among the highest in Europe.While foreigners are still barred from entry for personal travel, the Eastern European country has kept its borders open for freight transit. With airline capacity 92% below 2019 levels, the government is eager to vaccinated host soccer fans in June at the Euro 2021 soccer tournament.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/vaccinated-nations-fear-quick-reopening-hurt-hopes-of-aviation-revival-101618650631308.html

Mexico has administered almost 13.5 million doses to date, still a small amount for a country of 126 million.Mexico has suffered 211,693 test-confirmed deaths, but because the country does so little testing, authorities acknowledge the real toll is over 330,000.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/14-of-nearly-2-600-townships-in-mexico-refuse-covid-19-vaccination-authorities-101618648904451.html
17-04-2021||World||Biden scraps pledge for quick expansion of allowing refugees into US||President Joe Biden's administration announced Friday he was scrapping his pledge for a rapid expansion in the number of refugees allowed into the United States, but seemed to backtrack later in the day after fierce blowback from within his Democratic Party.The outcry came after a senior administration official said Biden would maintain the historically low ceiling of 15,000 people resettled a year, a number set by predecessor Donald Trump who had imposed hardline border policies.The Biden administration had recently stated it wanted to allow in about 60,000 refugees annually, ramping up to double the following year. That aim had been part of the Democrat's broader promise to end harsh anti-immigrant and anti-refugee sentiment whipped up by Trump.Instead, the White House will keep the strict 15,000 limit so that it can "rebuild" a broken program and deal with pandemic-related complications, said the official, who asked not to be identified.After a top Democrat and refugee aid groups slammed Biden's target as "appallingly low" and "deeply disappointing," the White House issued a statement later Friday saying the number was provisional.Noting that Biden has green-lighted settlement of refugees from previously blocked regions and signed off on flights from those areas to begin within days, the White House said it expected Biden "to set a final, increased refugee cap for the remainder of this fiscal year by May 15," but added that "his initial goal of 62,500 seems unlikely."The admissions system left by the Trump administration was "even more decimated than we'd thought, requiring a major overhaul in order to build back toward the numbers to which we've committed," the senior official said.White House National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan also said the refugee program needs rebuilding."We will use all 15,000 slots... and work with Congress on increasing admissions and building back to the numbers to which we've committed," he tweeted.About 7,000 slots are reserved for refugees from Africa, 1,000 from East Asia, 1,500 from Europe and Central Asia, 3,000 from Latin America and the Caribbean, plus 1,500 from the Near East and South Asia. There is a reserve of 1,000 slots.- 'Moral leadership' -The policy marks a strong reversal from the Biden administration's vow to let in 62,500 refugees, with 125,000 next year."We offered safe havens for those fleeing violence or persecution" in previous years, when America's "moral leadership on refugee issues" encouraged other nations to open their doors as well, Biden said, promising to make good on his campaign promise of restoring US leadership.Senate Foreign Relations Chair Bob Menendez had sharply criticized the White House, saying it "has not only stymied the number of refugees permitted entrance, it has prevented the State Dept from admitting vetted refugees currently waiting in the system."In a letter to Biden, Menendez called 15,000 "appallingly low.""As we face the largest global refugee crisis in history, with 29.6 million refugees worldwide, resettlement serves as a critical tool in providing protection to those fleeing persecution," he wrote.LIRS, one of the chief organizations helping refugees in the United States, said that as of this month, only 2,000 refugees have been resettled in the current fiscal year.Krish O'Mara Vignarajah, CEO of the Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service, said "it is deeply disappointing that the administration has elected to leave in place the shameful, record low admissions cap of its predecessor.""There is far more work ahead to reclaim global leadership. The challenge of ramping up admissions to President Biden's pledge of 125,000 is daunting, but it is an occasion we can rise to."Another refugee settlement organization, Kids in Need of Defense, said "our nation is at its best when it honors its commitments.""KIND recognizes that the gutted immigration system inherited by the current administration poses significant challenges, but the need to restore -- and in some cases completely reestablish -- these vital systems cannot be used as an excuse to sidestep America's longtime commitment to protecting refugees fleeing for their lives," president Wendy Young said.Following Biden's apparent change of heart on the refugee numbers, firebrand Democratic congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez cheered the news."This is a testament to the power that people's movements, community advocates, & progressive coalitions have built," she tweeted. "Now let's get these families to their new homes here in the United States."sms-acb/axn||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-scraps-pledge-for-quick-expansion-of-allowing-refugees-into-us-101618636116744.html
17-04-2021||World||Coronavirus is airborne. Experts give 10 reasons in support||SARS-CoV-2, the virus which causes the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), is predominantly transmitted through the air, according to a new study published in The Lancet journal. "There is consistent, strong evidence that SARS-CoV-2 spreads by airborne transmission. Although other routes can contribute, we believe that the airborne route is likely to be dominant. The public health community should act accordingly and without further delay,” according to the analysis by six experts from the UK, the US and Canada.The team of experts, led by the University of Oxford's Trisha Greenhalgh, reviewed published research and identified 10 evidence to support the predominance of the airborne route.The experts pointed out that superspreading events account for substantial SARS-CoV-2 transmission, saying “such events may be the pandemic's primary drivers.” “Detailed analyses of human behaviours and interactions, room sizes, ventilation, and other variables in choir concerts, cruise ships, slaughterhouses, care homes, and correctional facilities, among other settings, have shown patterns—eg, long-range transmission and overdispersion of the basic reproduction number (R0), discussed below—consistent with airborne spread of SARS-CoV-2 that cannot be adequately explained by droplets or fomites.”Also watch: How Covid variants & mass gatherings led to surge of cases in India I HT InsightLong-range transmission of SARS-CoV-2 between people in adjacent rooms but never in each other's presence has been documented in quarantine hotels, they said. “Historically, it was possible to prove long-range transmission only in the complete absence of community transmission,” they added.According to the experts, asymptomatic or presymptomatic transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from people who are not coughing or sneezing is likely to account for "at least a third, and perhaps up to 59%, of all transmission globally and is a key way the virus has spread around the world."Also read | India's Covid-19 tally over 14.52 million with 234,692 fresh infectionsThe transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is higher indoors than outdoors and is substantially reduced by indoor ventilation. “Both observations support a predominantly airborne route of transmission,” they added. “Fifth, nosocomial infections have been documented in health-care organisations, where there have been strict contact-and-droplet precautions and use of personal protective equipment (PPE) designed to protect against droplet but not aerosol exposure,” they added.As the sixth evidence, experts say that viable SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in the air. “In laboratory experiments, SARS-CoV-2 stayed infectious in the air for up to 3 h with a half-life of 1·1 h. Viable SARS-CoV-2 was identified in air samples from rooms occupied by COVID-19 patients in the absence of aerosol-generating health-care procedures13 and in air samples from an infected person's car,” they pointed out in the study.Also read | Daily Covid-19 deaths may soar past 2,000: ReportThey also said that other studies have failed to capture viable SARS-CoV-2 in air samples, saying sampling of airborne virus is technically challenging for several reasons. They said limited effectiveness of some sampling methods for collecting fine particles, viral dehydration during collection, viral damage due to impact forces, reaerosolisation of virus during collection, and viral retention in the sampling equipment are among them.SARS-CoV-2 has been identified in air filters and building ducts in hospitals with Covid-19 patients, according to the study as the researchers pointed out that such locations could be reached only by aerosols. As their eighth evidence, they cited studies involving infected caged animals that were connected to separately caged uninfected animals through an air duct have shown transmission of SARS-CoV-2 that “can be adequately explained only by aerosols.”Also read | Covid-19 in Brazil: Graveyard workers say 600 graves dug every day“Ninth, no study to our knowledge has provided strong or consistent evidence to refute the hypothesis of airborne SARS-CoV-2 transmission,” the experts said. Some people have avoided contracting the coronavirus disease when they have shared air with infected people, but this situation could be explained by a combination of factors. These factors, they said, include variation in the amount of viral shedding between infectious individuals by several orders of magnitude and different environmental (especially ventilation) conditions. “Individual and environmental variation means that a minority of primary cases (notably, individuals shedding high levels of virus in indoor, crowded settings with poor ventilation) account for a majority of secondary infections, which is supported by high-quality contact tracing data from several countries,” they added.There is limited evidence to support other dominant routes of transmission—respiratory droplet or fomite—they said. “Ease of infection between people in close proximity to each other has been cited as proof of respiratory droplet transmission of SARS-CoV-2. However, close-proximity transmission in most cases along with distant infection for a few when sharing air is more likely to be explained by dilution of exhaled aerosols with distance from an infected person,” they added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-is-airborne-experts-give-10-reasons-in-support-101618634132170.html

The clause will not apply in cases of sexual assault.The legislation also considers incestuous sex with a minor under 18 to be rape.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-changes-child-rape-law-101618625267810.html

International inspectors already said Iran planned to do so above-ground at its Natanz nuclear site.The move is likely to raise tensions even as Iran negotiates in Vienna over a way to allow the US back into the agreement and lift the crushing economic sanctions it faces. However, its scope provides Iran with a way to quickly de-escalate if it chose.The announcement also marks a significant escalation after the attack that damaged centrifuges at Natanz, an attack this past weekend suspected of having been carried out by Israel. While Israel has yet to claim it, it comes amid a long-running shadow war between the two Mideast rivals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/with-an-eye-on-vienna-n-talks-iran-enriching-uranium-to-its-highest-level-101618624682280.html

China has strongly denied the charge.A team of WHO experts, which probed the origin of the coronavirus, concluded last month that “all hypotheses” included the allegation that COVID-19 could have emanated from a bio lab "remained open".World Health Organisation (WHO) Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, while receiving the report of the international experts’ team which visited Wuhan, said on March 30 that “as far as the WHO is concerned, all hypotheses remain on the table”.“This report is a very important beginning, but it is not the end. We have not yet found the source of the virus, and we must continue to follow the science and leave no stone unturned as we do,” he said.Significantly, Tedros said the team has concluded that leak from the WIV as alleged by former US president Donald Trump is the “least likely hypothesis” but it requires further probe.“The team also visited several laboratories in Wuhan and considered the possibility that the virus entered the human population as a result of a laboratory incident.“However, I do not believe that this assessment was extensive enough. Further data and studies will be needed to reach more robust conclusions,” Tedros said.“Although the team has concluded that a laboratory leak is the least likely hypothesis, this requires further investigation, potentially with additional missions involving specialist experts, which I am ready to deploy,” the WHO chief added.Yang Zhanqiu, deputy director of the pathogen biology department at Wuhan University, told the Global Times on Thursday that the law on biosafety is a timely move for China to detail the construction and management of biosafety labs and provide a legal shield for scientific projects on biosafety, including infectious diseases, to be carried out in a scrupulous and professional manner.According to John Hopkins coronavirus tracker, China has so far reported 102,152 cases and 4,845 deaths. Globally the contagion has infected 139,228,122 people and killed 29,89,103, it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-builds-more-bio-labs-amid-questions-over-wuhan-lab-s-role-in-covid-origin-101618623140417.html

Dynetics is a unit of Leidos Holdings Inc.Also Read: NASA says SpaceX wins $2.9 billion contract for moon spacecraft"NASA Rules!!" Musk wrote on Twitter after the announcement.The U.S. space agency awarded the contract for the first commercial human lander, part of its Artemis program. NASA said the lander will carry two American astronauts to the lunar surface."We should accomplish the next landing as soon as possible," Steve Jurczyk, NASA's acting administrator, said during the video conference announcement."If they hit their milestones, we have a shot at 2024," Jurczyk added.NASA said SpaceX's Starship includes a spacious cabin and two airlocks for astronaut moon walks and that its architecture is intended to evolve to a fully reusable launch and landing system designed for travel to the Moon, Mars and other destinations in space.SpaceX also responded on Twitter, writing, "We are humbled to help @NASAArtemis usher in a new era of human space exploration."Unlike the Apollo landings from 1969 to 1972 - the only human visits to the moon's surface - NASA is gearing up for a longer-term lunar presence that it envisions as a steppingstone to an even more ambitious plan to send astronauts to Mars. NASA is leaning heavily on private companies built around shared visions for space exploration.SpaceX will be required to make a test flight of the lander to the moon before humans make the journey, NASA official Lisa Watson-Morgan told reporters.NASA had been expected to winnow the lunar lander contest to two companies by the end of April, but instead it picked only SpaceX, a move that deepens their cooperation. On Thursday, NASA said it would send its crew to the International Space Station aboard a SpaceX rocket on April 22.The agency aims to create regular service to the moon and said it will have a separate competition for that contract."We have to be able to provide for recurring lunar services," said Mark Kirasich, deputy associate administrator for NASA's Advanced Exploration Systems division.The announcement added to an extraordinary run for Musk, who has turned electric car maker Tesla Inc. into the world's most-valuable automaker, with a market capitalization of $702 billion.Musk has become a one-person technology conglomerate, launching or controlling companies pursuing space flight, electric cars, neural implants and subterranean tunnel boring.A factor in the choice of SpaceX was "what's the best value to the government," said Kathy Lueders, associate administrator for NASA's Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate.NASA said in a news release that SpaceX's HLS Starship, designed to land on the moon, "leans on the company's tested Raptor engines and flight heritage of the Falcon and Dragon vehicles."NASA's decision was a setback for Bezos, a lifelong space enthusiast who is now more focused on his space venture after having announced in February he would step down as Amazon CEO.The contract was seen by Bezos and other executives as vital to Blue Origin establishing itself as a desired partner for NASA, and also putting the venture on the road to turning a profit.Musk has outlined an ambitious agenda for SpaceX and its reusable rockets, including landing humans on Mars. But in the near term, SpaceX's main business has been launching satellites for Musk's Starlink internet venture, and other satellites and space cargo. SpaceX announced on Wednesday it had raised about $1.16 billion in equity financing.An uncrewed SpaceX Starship prototype rocket failed to land safely on March 30 after a test launch from Boca Chica, Texas. The Starship was one in a series of prototypes for the heavy-lift rocket being developed by SpaceX to carry humans and 100 tons of cargo on future missions to the moon and Mars. A first orbital Starship flight is planned for year's end.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nasa-rules-says-elon-musk-as-spacex-wins-2-9-billion-moon-lander-contract-101618618275944.html
17-04-2021||World||Joe Biden-Yoshihide Suga maiden meet focuses on reducing China's growing clout||President Joe Biden welcomed Japan’s Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga to the White House Friday for conversations centered on a growing concern for both leaders: what to do about China.Suga said he and Biden agreed to pursue collaboration on climate change, Covid-19 and the global shortage of semiconductors. But China’s increasingly assertive role in the region loomed large in the talks, Biden’s first in-person meeting at the White House with a foreign leader since taking office.“We committed to working together to take on the challenges from China, and on issues like the East China Sea, the South China Sea as well as North Korea to ensure a future of a free and open Indo-Pacific,” Biden said at joint news conference in the White House Rose Garden. Suga said the leaders pledged “peace and stability” in the Taiwan Strait.But the two didn’t announce any major new agreements on China, and Japan must strike a balance between deterring China while keeping Beijing, its largest trading partner, from lashing out. Asked by a reporter, Suga said he wouldn’t provide details of his “diplomatic exchanges” with Biden over the Taiwan Strait.On other topics, Suga said he won Biden’s backing for hosting the Tokyo Olympics, which are set to begin in July, despite the continuing coronavirus pandemic. And Biden said the two leaders agreed to collaborate on technology, including the supply shortage on semiconductors that has idled some U.S. auto manufacturing and created shortages of some consumer products.“We’re going to work together across a range of fields,” Biden said. “From promoting secure and reliable 5G networks to increasing our cooperation on supply chains for critical sectors like semiconductors, to driving joint research in areas like AI, genomics, quantum computing and much more.”Asked about Iran, Biden criticized the Islamic Republic’s decision to further enrich uranium but signaled that the move won’t prevent indirect talks in Vienna aimed at restoring a 2015 nuclear accord from proceeding.Suga had breakfast on Friday with former US Ambassador to Japan Caroline Kennedy and then took part in a wreath-laying ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery. He also met with Vice President Kamala Harris.Shift to AsiaThe timing of the meeting -- just days after Biden announced a withdrawal from Afghanistan -- provides the most visible sign yet that the American president is determined to shift the center of gravity of US foreign policy to the Indo-Pacific. And for Japan, being first into the White House gives Suga a prime chance to set the tone for ties with Washington over a slew of issues for years to come.Friday’s meeting builds on Secretary of State Antony Blinken’s first visits abroad last month to Japan and South Korea, and it comes amid China’s continuing aggressiveness over Hong Kong, Taiwan and the South China Sea.Ahead of the Biden-Suga talks, China’s foreign ministry spokesman expressed “serious concerns” about negative moves and collusion between the US and Japan, the Associated Press reported. Spokesman Zhao Lijian said the two nations should “avoid words and actions that interfere in China’s internal affairs and harm China’s interests,” according to the AP.China escalated its military intimidation of the government in Taipei by sending 25 fighters, bombers and other planes into the southwest section of Taiwan’s air defense identification zone early this week. Chinese military activity has steadily picked up around democratically ruled Taiwan in recent months.Suga said he and Biden “agreed to oppose any attempts to change the status quo by force or coercion in the East or South China Seas and intimidation of others in the region.”He added: “At the same time, we agreed on the necessity for each of us to engage in frank dialogue with China, and in so doing to pursue stability of international relations while upholding universal values.”Last month, Blinken, his Japanese counterpart Toshimitsu Motegi and both nations’ defense ministers made unusually explicit references to China’s “coercion and destabilizing behavior” and to concerns over human rights.Yet despite Japan’s willingness to criticize China and step up its commitments on climate change, the US and Japanese approaches aren’t entirely in lockstep.While Japan is investing heavily in green energy and has set a zero-emissions target for 2050, it has been criticized for not moving aggressively enough to reduce emissions by 2030. Biden and Suga said they agreed to cooperate on climate change and green energy.And while Japan is worried about China’s military buildup, it is arguably just as concerned about undercutting economic ties. China is Japan’s biggest export market, with more than 13,000 Japanese companies are operating in China, according to a survey published last year.Suga has come under pressure, including from lawmakers in his own party, for Japan to join other major democracies in imposing sanctions on China over human rights abuses. But Japan lacks a legal framework to take such a step, and some members of its business community are opposed.Suga treated lightly on questions about human rights abuses in China. “As we engaged in an exchange of views over the recent situation we also discussed the circumstances in Taiwan and Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region as well,” Suga said.A senior Japanese official said that while Tokyo is becoming increasingly vocal against China on human rights, it doesn’t think that sanctions and trade restrictions are a productive way to deal with Beijing. The official added that Japan and the US plan to work closely on supply-chain resilience, focusing on key areas such as raw materials and semiconductors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-yoshihide-suga-maiden-meet-focuses-on-reducing-china-s-growing-clout-101618617539669.html
17-04-2021||World||Epstein sex-trafficking case: Ghislaine Maxwell to stand trial||Ghislaine Maxwell must stand trial on sex-trafficking charges after a USjudge rejected her dismissal request, paving the way for a trial that could begin as soon as July.The ruling by US District Judge Alison Nathan is the latest blow to the British socialite, who has been jailed in a high-security jail in New York since her arrest in July. While Maxwell, 59, is likely to file additional dismissal bids, the decision Friday defeats many of her key legal arguments.Maxwell is accused of recruiting girls for sex for former boyfriend Jeffrey Epstein in a scheme that ran from 1994 to 2004. She advanced numerous grounds for a dismissal, including a claim that federal prosecutors in Manhattan were barred from charging her as part of a deal that US prosecutors in Florida reached with Epstein in 2007.Nathan rejected the argument, calling Maxwell’s reading of the deal “an improbable interpretation.” In it, the Florida federal prosecutors agreed not to prosecute Epstein if he pleaded guilty to state charges, as he did. Maxwell wasn’t a party to the agreement.“The non-prosecution agreement was expressly limited to the Southern District of Florida” and did not apply in New York, Nathan said.Maxwell denies wrongdoing and has said her accusers are lying. Her lawyers didn’t immediately return an email seeking comment. Jim Margolin, a spokesman for US Attorney Audrey Strauss, declined to comment.In a 34-page decision, Nathan also concluded that prosecutors in New York didn’t wait too long to file charges, as Maxwell claimed, because the government has additional time to bring a case involving sex abuse of minors. The US Attorney in Manhattan began investigating in 2018 after a series of stories in The Miami Herald newspaper.“The court sees no evidence that the government’s delay in bringing these charges was designed to thwart Maxwell’s ability to prepare a defense,” Nathan said.Nathan granted one of Maxwell’s requests, saying she could have a separate trial to defend herself on two perjury charges. Prosecutors say Maxwell lied under oath in 2016 during a civil defamation suit brought by Epstein accuser Virginia Guiffre.Epstein, charged in New York with sex-trafficking in July 2019, was found dead in his jail cell the next month, in what authorities ruled a suicide.Maxwell has asked that her trial, now set for July 12 in Manhattan, be delayed so she can review evidence relating to additional allegations filed against her last month. She’s also appealing the judge’s refusal to release her from jail.The case is US v. Maxwell, 20-cr-330, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/epstein-sex-trafficking-case-ghislaine-maxwell-to-stand-trial-101618616920029.html

The mission, called Artemis, will be the first by the US space agency since its Apollo mission, the report said. The bid by Musk, who also leads Tesla, beat one from Amazon.com CEO Jeff Bezos, had partnered with Lockheed Martin Corp, Northrop Grumman Corp and Draper, according to the report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/spacex-wins-nasa-contract-to-send-astronauts-to-moon-101618615257389.html
17-04-2021||World||Joe Biden calls spate of mass shootings a ‘National Embarrassment’||President Joe Biden called the spate of mass shootings in the U.S. a “national embarrassment” and challenged the Senate to take up a gun-control bill passed by the House.Biden spoke at a joint news conference with Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga on Friday, a day after a gunman opened fire at a FedEx Corp. facility near Indianapolis International Airport, killing eight people and wounding several others before apparently taking his own life.Biden said that most Americans, including gun owners, support background checks for weapons purchases. “I call on my friends in the Senate to bring up the House-passed bill now,” he said, while acknowledging he doesn’t control the Senate agenda.“Who in God’s name needs a weapon that can old 100 rounds or 40 rounds?” Biden asked, referring to high-capacity magazines. “It’s just wrong.”“I’m not going to give up until it’s done,” he added.Earlier Friday, Biden ordered U.S. flags to fly at half-staff after the Indianapolis shooting, the latest in series of massacres that have shaken the nation.The recent spate of shootings have thrust gun violence back into the national spotlight and created another domestic challenge for a president already confronting the coronavirus pandemic, a historic migrant influx and police shootings of Black Americans.Biden signed several executive actions last week aimed at curbing gun violence and called on Congress to pass gun legislation, though he acknowledged the difficulty of enacting new laws with the House and Senate closely divided along party lines.Nonetheless, the president has said action is needed and that the number of mass shootings has humiliated the U.S. in the eyes of the world.“It’s a national embarrassment,” Biden said in the Rose Garden with Suga listening alongside him.Recent shootings in Colorado and Georgia left 18 people dead and caused gun-control advocates and Democratic lawmakers to ramp up pressure on Biden to address the issue.Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris were briefed earlier Friday on the Indianapolis shooting. White House chief of staff Ron Klain had contacted the city’s mayor, and Homeland Security Adviser Elizabeth Sherwood-Randall was in touch with local law enforcement, according to the White House.Five people were hospitalized after Thursday night’s shooting including one with critical injuries, according to the Associated Press. Police said the gunman apparently killed himself after shooting the others, the AP reported.Biden’s executive actions would crack down on “ghost guns,” which can be assembled from kits and are not traceable by law enforcement because they lack serial numbers, as well as braces for pistols that make firearms more stable and accurate.The president also announced federal funds would go toward community violence intervention and prevention programs that are designed to de-escalate conflicts in urban communities before they turn violent. His proposed infrastructure bill includes $5 billion over eight years for the programs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-calls-fedex-mass-shooting-a-national-embarrassment-101618611346892.html
17-04-2021||World||NASA says SpaceX wins $2.9 billion contract for moon spacecraft||NASA said on Friday it has awarded billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk's private space company SpaceX a $2.9 billion contract to build a spacecraft to fly astronauts to the moon, picking it over Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin and defense contractor Dynetics Inc.The bid by Tesla Inc chief Musk beat one from Amazon.com Inc's founder Jeff Bezos, who had partnered with Lockheed Martin Corp, Northrop Grumman Corp and Draper. Bezos also owns the Washington Post.The U.S. space agency made the announcement in a videoconference.The NASA announcement added to an extraordinary run for Musk, who is one of the world's richest people thanks to his 22% stake in electric car maker Tesla Inc.Tesla has become the world's most-valuable automaker, with a market capitalization of $702 billion, far surpassing the auto industry's giants. Musk has become a one-person technology conglomerate, launching or controlling companies pursuing space flight, electric cars, neural implants and subterranean tunnel boring.NASA's decision was a setback for Bezos, a lifelong space enthusiast and one of the world's richest people, who is now more focused on his space venture after having announced in February he would step down as Amazon CEO.The contract was seen by Bezos and other executives as vital to Blue Origin establishing itself as a desired partner for NASA, and also putting the venture on the road to turning a profit, Reuters had reported in February.SpaceX announced on Wednesday it had raised about $1.16 billion in equity financing.Musk has outlined an ambitious agenda for SpaceX and its reusable rockets, including landing humans on Mars. But in the near term, SpaceX's main business has been launching satellites for Musk's Starlink internet venture, and other satellites and space cargo.Unlike the Apollo lunar landings from 1969 to 1972, NASA now is gearing up for a long-term presence on the moon that it envisions as a steppingstone to an even more ambitious plan to send astronauts to reach Mars. NASA is leaning heavily on private companies built around shared visions for space exploration.NASA in December designated 18 astronauts for possible participation in planned NASA missions to return to the moon's surface, with a target date of 2024.An uncrewed SpaceX Starship prototype rocket failed to land safely on March 30 after a test launch from Boca Chica, Texas. The Starship was one in a series of prototypes for the heavy-lift rocket being developed by SpaceX to carry humans and 100 tons of cargo on future missions to the moon and Mars. A first orbital Starship flight is planned for year's end.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nasa-says-spacex-wins-2-9-billion-contract-for-moon-spacecraft-101618604896120.html

This variant has been designated VUI-21APR-01. PHE and international partners continue to monitor the situation closely,” said the April 15 update by Public Health England (PHE).World Health Organization (WHO) officials too said they were treating it as a variant of interest. “This is a variant of interest we are following,” Maria Van Kerkhove, the WHO’s technical lead officer on Covid, told reporters on Friday, Bloomberg reported.“Having two of these mutations, which have been seen in other variants around the world, are concerning,” she said, adding that there was a similarity with mutations that increase transmission as well as reduce neutralisation, possibly stunting the ability of vaccines to curb them.The variant is now among seven that is under investigation by the UK health agency. It was found in 73 infections in England and four in Scotland, the latest of PHE’s weekly briefing said.“77 appears to be a relatively high number of first detected cases for the B.1.617 variant under investigation first detected in India... I await PHE’s expert analysis of the particular risks of B.1.617,” said Dr Duncan Robertson, a policy expert at Loughborough University, in a tweet.Also Read | ‘Stricter lockdown’ if people violate Covid-19 norms: Maharashtra ministerTypically, new variants begin appearing gradually in samples if surveillance is adequate. The Covid-19 genomics UK consortium (COG-UK) sequences roughly 10% of all cases, a rate that experts say India must attempt to match.The Indian Sars-CoV-2 Consortium on Genomics (Insacog), by comparison, has 13,614 sequences since it began functioning in December, the Union health ministry said on Friday. This comes to about 0.34% of the 3.9 million positive cases recorded in India since January 1, 2021.An analysis of genome sequences uploaded by Indian scientists to the global repository of viral pathogen GISAID Initiative has shown that the B.1.617 has been found in increasing number of samples of late, becoming the most common of variants to be detected in the 60 days up till April 2.While Indian authorities are yet to disclose this data, top officials have said that it is increasing in prevalence. “From barely existing in December, it is now found pretty much everywhere we look. We have a separate column for the variant for every state now,” said Anurag Agarwal, director, Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology, one of the 10 labs under Insacog, on Thursday.Once studies determine that a VUI can cause a more severe outbreak or evade immunity conferred by a vaccine or a previous infection, it is classified as a VOC, or a variant of concern.B.1.617 has two mutations -- E484Q (glutamate is replaced by glutamine at the 484th spot of the spike protein) and L452R (substitution of leucine with arginine at the 452nd position) – among others that are being investigated for giving the virus an ability to evade immunity.L452R has also been found in a variant spreading in California, US, where it was implicated in a large outbreak earlier this year.At present, there are five VOC’s. The first, B.1.1.7 was found in the UK and has been confirmed to be more transmissible and was also implicated in a large resurgence of cases across the UK.US considers the California variant as VOC as well, while globally, the other VOCs are the South African variant (B.1.351) and the Brazilian variant (P.1).“As on 15/04/2021, 13,614 WGS (whole genome samples) samples have been processed at the 10 designated INSACOG labs. Of these, 1,189 samples have tested positive for variants of concern for Sars-Cov-2 in India. This includes 1,109 samples with UK variants; 79 samples with South African variant and 1 sample with the Brazil variant,” the Union health ministry said on Friday. It did not give a breakdown of how many were found in samples from travellers or those taken from community sampling.The government added that the test kits being used in India “do not miss these mutations as the RT-PCR tests being used in India target more than two genes”. The clarification was amid increasing anecdotes from several parts of the country that there has been a rise in false negatives.“The detection of these mutations does not change the strategy of management which remains to test, track, trace and treat. The use of masks remains as the most important shield to prevent the spread of Covid 19,” the health ministry statement added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/double-mutant-variant-now-also-spreading-in-uk-101618602680491.html
17-04-2021||World||Police ID killer in FedEx shooting as 19-year-old man; Sikh community members among wounded, killed||Police scoured a Fedex facility in Indianapolis and searched the suspected gunman's home Friday looking for a motive for the latest mass shooting to rock the US, as family members of the eight victims spent agonizing hours awaiting word on their loved ones.The shooter was identified as 19-year-old Brandon Scott Hole of Indiana, two law enforcement officials briefed on the matter told The Associated Press. The investigators searched a home in Indianapolis associated with Hole and seized evidence, including desktop computers and other electronic media, the officials said. The officials could not discuss the matter publicly and spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity.Indianapolis police said earlier that they had not yet discovered the gunman's motive for opening fire with a rifle late Thursday night at a FedEx processing center near the Indianapolis airport.Indianapolis Deputy Police Chief Craig McCartt said the gunman started randomly shooting at people in the parking lot and then went into the building and continued firing. He said the shooter apparently died by suicide shortly before police entered the building.“There was no confrontation with anyone that was there,” he said. “There was no disturbance, there was no argument. He just appeared to randomly start shooting."McCartt said four people were killed outside the building and another four inside. Several people were also wounded, including five who were taken to the hospital.The carnage took just a couple of minutes. “It did not last very long,” he said.Officials with the coroner's office began the process of identifying victims Friday afternoon, a process they said would take several hours.Police Chief Randal Taylor noted that a “significant” number of employees at the facility are members of the Sikh community, and the Sikh Coalition later confirmed that members of the community were among the wounded and killed.The coalition, which identifies itself as the largest Sikh civil rights organization in the U.S., said in a statement that it expected authorities to “conduct a full investigation — including the possibility of bias as a factor.”The coalition's executive director, Satjeet Kaur, noted in the statement that more than 8,000 Sikh Americans live in Indiana.The families' agonizing waiting was exacerbated by the fact that most employees aren't allowed to carry cellphones inside the FedEx building, making contact with them difficult.“When you see notifications on your phone, but you're not getting a text back from your kid and you're not getting information and you still don't know where they are … what are you supposed to do?” Mindy Carson said early Friday, fighting back tears.Later Friday morning, Carson said she had heard from her daughter Jessica, who works in the facility and that she was OK. She was going to meet her, but didn't say where.FedEx said in a statement that cellphone access is limited to a small number of workers in the dock and package sorting areas to “support safety protocols and minimize potential distractions.”FedEx Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Frederick Smith called the shooting a “senseless act of violence.”“This is a devastating day, and words are hard to describe the emotions we all feel,” he wrote in an email to employees.The killings marked the latest in a string of recent mass shootings across the country and the third mass shooting this year in Indianapolis.Five people, including a pregnant woman, were shot and killed in the city in January, and a man was accused of killing three adults and a child before abducting his daughter during at argument at a home in March. In other states last month, eight people were fatally shot at massage businesses in the Atlanta area, and 10 died in gunfire at a supermarket in Boulder, Colorado.Indianapolis Mayor Joe Hogsett said the community must guard against resignation and “the assumption that this is simply how it must be and we might as well get used to it.”President Joe Biden said he had been briefed on the shooting and called gun violence “an epidemic” in the U.S.“Too many Americans are dying every single day from gun violence. It stains our character and pierces the very soul of our nation,” he said in a statement.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she was “horrified and heartbroken” by the shooting and called for congressional action on gun control.“As we pray for the families of all affected, we must work urgently to enact commonsense gun violence prevention laws to save lives & prevent this suffering,” the Democratic leader said in a tweet.A witness said he was working inside the building when he heard several gunshots in rapid succession.“I see a man come out with a rifle in his hand and he starts firing and he starts yelling stuff that I could not understand,” Levi Miller told WTHR-TV. “What I ended up doing was ducking down to make sure he did not see me because I thought he would see me and he would shoot me.”A man told WTTV that his niece was sitting in the driver's seat of her car when the gunfire erupted, and she was wounded.“She got shot on her left arm,” said Parminder Singh. “She's fine, she's in the hospital now.”Gov. Eric Holcomb ordered flags to be flown at half-staff until April 20, and he and others decried the shooting.Chris Bavender, a spokesperson for the FBI's Indianapolis office, said the bureau is helping with the investigation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/police-id-killer-in-fedex-shooting-as-19-year-old-man-sikh-community-members-among-wounded-killed-101618601397699.html

Farmers can sacrifice their lives but they will not leave protesting against the laws, he said, adding that farmers of the country are united in the fight.Thousands of farmers, mostly from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, have been camping at three border points of Delhi -- Singhu, Tikri (along Haryana), and Ghazipur -- demanding a repeal of the three farm laws enacted by the Centre in September last year.The Centre says the new farm laws will free farmers from middlemen, giving them more options to sell their crops.The protesting farmers, however, say the laws will weaken the minimum support price (MSP) system and leave them at the mercy of big corporates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/wont-end-protest-against-farm-laws-bku-leader-naresh-tikait-101618681531720.html

17-04-2021||India||8 Indian states highly vulnerable to climate change: Report||Eight Indian states -- Jharkhand, Mizoram, Odisha, Chhattisgarh, Assam, Bihar, Arunachal Pradesh and West Bengal -- are highly vulnerable to climate change, according to a national climate vulnerability assessment report.These states, mostly in the eastern part of the country, require prioritisation of adaptation interventions, the report pointed out.Among all states, Assam, Bihar and Jharkhand have over 60 per cent districts in the category of highly vulnerable districts.Lack of forest area per 100 rural population was found to be one of the major drivers of vulnerability for Assam despite the fact that the state has a forest cover of 42 per cent, followed by low road density, the report said.In case of Bihar, the report cited poor health infrastructure to be the key vulnerability driver in 36 districts, followed by a high percentage of marginal and small operational holders in 24 districts.The lack of implementation of the rural employment scheme MGNREGA, causing a lack of alternative livelihood opportunities, appeared as a key driver in 14 districts of Bihar, followed by a lack of women's participation in the workforce in 11 districts.Lack of crop insurance and rainfed agriculture were key drivers of vulnerability for Jharkhand.The report, titled 'Climate Vulnerability Assessment for Adaptation Planning in India Using a Common Framework', which identifies the most vulnerable states and districts in India with respect to current climate risk and key drivers of vulnerability, was released by Department of Science and Technology (DST) Secretary Ashutosh Sharma.Himachal Pradesh, Telangana, Sikkim and Punjab have been categorised as lower-middle vulnerable states. Uttarakhand, Haryana, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Nagaland, Goa and Maharashtra have been categorised as states with low vulnerability.“We have seen how extreme events are on rise both in terms of their number and severity. Mapping the parts of India that are vulnerable to such changes will help initiating climate actions at the ground level.“The report should be made easily accessible to all stakeholders so that it can benefit climate-vulnerable communities across India through development of better-designed climate change adaptation projects,” said Sharma.He also suggested that the maps should be made available to people who need it.“Assessing vulnerability was the first step towards assessing climate risk. There are two other components like hazard and exposure that need to be also assessed to arrive at overall climate risk.“DST would take up these assessments in the next phase along with sectoral vulnerability assessments and assessments at sub-district levels,” said Akhilesh Gupta, Head, Climate Change Programme (CCP), DST.Prof N H Ravindranath, retired climate change expert from the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), explained that the report has helped identify the most vulnerable states, districts and panchayats and will aid in prioritising adaptation investment, developing and implementing adaptation programmes.Director of IIT Mandi Professor Ajit Kumar Chaturvedi and Director of IIT Guwahati T G Sitharaman hoped that the report will be taken up by the states for initiating climate action.A total of 94 representatives from 24 states and two Union Territories participated in the nationwide exercise jointly supported by the DST and the Swiss Agency for Development & Cooperation (SDC).Corinne Demenge, Head, Swiss Cooperation Office, Embassy of Switzerland in India, hoped that the assessments will contribute to the development of more targeted climate change projects and that they will support the implementation and the potential revisions of the State Action Plans on Climate Change.“The assessments can further be used for India's reporting on the Nationally Determined Contributions under the Paris Agreement. And finally, these assessments will support India's National Action Plan on Climate Change,” she added.The assessment will help policy-makers in initiating appropriate climate actions. It will also benefit climate-vulnerable communities across India through development of better-designed climate change adaptation projects.In a developing country such as India, vulnerability assessment is considered as an important exercise to develop suitable adaptation projects and programmes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/8-indian-states-highly-vulnerable-to-climate-change-report-101618678564084.html

17-04-2021||India||AIIMS director says must go back to earlier strategies to bring down Covid cases||Noting that the country was seeing a "huge strain" on the health care system due to a sharp rise in Covid-19 cases, AIIMS Delhi Director Dr Randeep Guleria has said that there is a need to go back to all the strategies that were being followed six-seven months back to bring about a reduction in the number of cases.In an interview with ANI, Dr Guleria said causes for the fast spread of the virus are "multi-factorial".Follow latest updates on Covid-19 here "But two main causes are that when in January and February vaccination started and cases went down, people stopped following COVID appropriate behaviour and at this time the virus mutated and it spread more rapidly," he said.The vaccination drive was launched on January 16 in the country.Dr Guleria said if 15 per cent of Covid-19 cases require hospital care and one person is admitted on average for five to seven days, hospital beds get occupied and with more patients coming, the hospitals may run out of beds."At present, we are not only seeing record-breaking numbers but we are also seeing a huge strain on the health care system. Because no health system will be able to manage so many patients. And we will have a crisis in terms of patient management. Doctors are already over-burdened. They have been working for more than a year and that also includes other healthcare workers," he added.He said there is a need to keep increasing hospital beds and resources for the increasing number of cases."We also have to urgently bring down the number of Covid-19 cases," he said.Dr Guleria called for a "multipronged attack" to contain the virus."There is a need to go back to all the strategies that we were following six-seven months ago to decrease the number of cases," he said.He noted that there has been a huge increase in the number of cases in a very few days "rather than weeks or months that we had seen last time".Asked about some people testing positive for COVID-19 even after taking the vaccine, he said vaccine prevents a person from getting the more severe disease but it does not prevent you from the infection totally."We have to remember that no vaccine is 100 per cent efficient. You may get the infection but the antibodies in our body will not allow the virus to multiply and you'll not have severe disease," he said.Answering a query, he said this a time when a lot of religious activities happen in the country and polls are also underway."We must understand lives are also important. We can do this in a restricted manner so that religious sentiment is not hurt and COVID appropriate behaviour can be followed," he said.Dr Guleria said there was no specific answer to how long the second wave of Covid-19 will continue in India and it depends on how quickly and efficiently the spread of virus is contained.Asked about the situation in Delhi, he said the city has a larger spike compared to the situation six-seven months ago."A lot of containment zones were made, almost like a mini-lockdown in those areas. We need to start looking at the same strategies," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aiims-director-says-must-go-back-to-earlier-strategies-to-bring-down-covid-cases-101618675611078.html

There should have been proper planning. OK if it was not done, there is still time and now a solid strategy should be adopted and concrete steps be taken," the Congress leader said.Priyanka Gandhi also appealed that financial support should be provided to the people who need it the most.There should be a package for small and medium businesses who are again on the verge of closing down, she said."I want to request the UP government that your administration should be sensitive rather than aggressive right now," Priyanka Gandhi said.The Congress has political differences with the Uttar Pradesh government and those will remain but "now we must stand together united in this fight", she asserted.The party will stand shoulder to shoulder with the people to combat this pandemic, Priyanka Gandhi said.In her video message, she also appealed to people to follow Covid-appropriate behaviour such as wearing masks, not venturing out unnecessarily and washing hands regularly.Later, Priyanka Gandhi also tagged a social media post in which an appeal was made to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to intervene to deal with the alleged lack of oxygen supply for people affected with Covid-19 in Varanasi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/up-govt-must-take-concrete-steps-on-covid-situation-priyanka-101618671476389.html

Religion and customs-traditions are vital but nothing is more important than life. It’s important to pay heed to the PM’s suggestion.”Giri also informed that a large number of seers have already started leaving the Mela because, “Traditionally the fourth Shahi Snan is attended mainly by the seers of the three Bairagi Akhadas, and for all the rest 10 Akhadas the Baishakhi Shahi Snan is the important one after which they start leaving.”“Juna Akhada will be taking part in the April 27 Chaitra Poornima Shahi Snan symbolically and I urge other Akhadas to follow suit,” he said.The governing body ---- the Akhil Bhartiya Akhada Parishad made it clear that the Mahakumbh “won’t be curtailed”.“It will be held till the completion of its designated period on April 30 as it has been held traditionally since centuries.

Top officers across various ministries will participate in the meeting.The meeting comes after India on Saturday recorded1.45 crore Covid-19 cases with 2,34,692 fresh infections - the sharpest-ever daily spike. 1,341 deaths were reported in the last 24 hours as the country saw deadliest day of coronavirus pandemic this year.PM Modi, earlier in the day, appealed that annual Kumbh Mela "should now only be symbolic" amid the coronavirus pandemic, stressing that it will give a boost to fight against the disease.The Prime Minister yesterday held a high-level meeting about the efforts being made by the government to import medical grade oxygen to bridge the demand-supply gap.Meanwhile, Union health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan earlier in the day chaired a high-level review meeting with the health ministers of 11 states/UTs to review measures taken by them for prevention, containment and management of recent surge in Covid-19 cases.Hospitals running out of oxygen supply and crematoriums struggling to keep up have caused worry as authorities struggle to curb the chain of transmission amid the fast-growing second wave of Covid-19.The surge in coronavirus cases is being reported as several states continue to report Covid-19 vaccine shortage. According to the health ministry data, over 12 crore vaccine doses have been administered so far.India is carrying out the world's largest vaccine programme which began on January 16. Earlier this month, the Covid-19 vaccine net was widened to those who are 45 years or above.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-to-hold-covid-19-review-meeting-with-top-officials-at-8pm-101618661943745.html

The cases are rising. Every state has a threshold of medical facilities. Delhi too has its limit and we have reports of shortage of beds, oxygen, Remdesivir in the city," Kejriwal said. Terming the situation serious and concerning, Kejriwal said, "In the last 24 hours, there have been around 24,000 cases. A day before, there were around 19,000 cases. So the tally spiked only in a matter of 24 hours."‘Covid-19 situation very grim, will enforce restrictions strictly’: Delhi PoliceSo far, there has been no shortage of bed in the Capital, Kejriwal said, adding that the government is focussing on creating more oxygen beds as serious patients need oxygen."In a few days, we will be able to add around 6,000 oxygen beds. Around 1,300 beds are being arranged at Yamuna Sports Complex and Commonwealth Games, Rada Soami facility will get 2,500 beds now and 2,500 later. Around 2,100 oxygen beds have been pooled as hotels and banquets are being linked with hospitals," Kejriwal said.But this may not be enough as the infection is spreading at an unprecedented rapidity. "No one knows when the peak will come. So now we don't have time to rest. We have to work on war footing to be a step ahead of corona," Kejriwal said.Urging the Centre to increase beds, Kejriwal said the Centre, in November, had granted 4,100 beds for Covid, but now when the situation is more precarious, only 1,800 beds in central government hospitals have been allotted for Covid-19 treatment.The AAP government has also instructed officials to raid markets to check whether there has been any hoarding of Remdesivir and other medicines that have become scarce now. On the testing situation in the Capital, Kejriwal said action will be taken against laboratories that are conducting more tests than their capacity and thus delaying the results.Kejriwal reviewed the Covid-19 situation of the Capital as it is observing the first day of the weekend lockdown on Saturday. The response has been positive, and the weekend lockdown decision will be reviewed, Kejriwal said. In a crucial decision, the government has already decided to take stringent action against hospitals turning away Covid-19 patients or not disclosing full information about the availability of beds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-now-facing-shortage-of-oxygen-supply-remdesivir-says-kejriwal-101618658419508.html

Between January 30 last year, when the first Covid-19 case was detected and January 16 this year, when the first vaccine was rolled, “there is a saga of tragedy, incompetence and colossal mismanagement,” the Congress said in a statement after a meeting of its working committee.The opposition party also accused the Centre of not releasing sufficient funds to the state governments to fight the pandemic. According to the Congress Working Committee (CWC) statement, despite warnings by experts, the government “failed miserably and paved the way for the havoc that is being caused by the second wave of the pandemic.”The CWC prepared a 14-point list of charges against the government over its “colossal mismanagement” of the war against the pandemic.

We have to keep increasing our hospital beds and resources for the increasing number of cases," Dr Guleria said, reported ANI."We also have to urgently bring down the number of Covid-19 cases," urged the AIIMS chief.Explaining that the cause for the recent surge in Covid-19 cases is multifactorial, Dr Guleria said, "The two main causes are-when in January, Feb vaccination started and cases went down people stopped following Covid-19 appropriate behaviour and at this time the virus mutated and it spread more rapidly."Stating that the political rallies and religious activities need to be restricted, Dr Guleria said, "This a time when a lot of religious activities happen in our country and polls are also underway. We can do this in a restricted manner so that religious sentiment is not hurt and Covid-19 appropriate behaviour can be followed."India's second wave of coronavirus disease has been aggravated by a lack of adherence to Covid-appropriate safety protocols and the circulation of highly infectious strains of SARS-CoV-2, Dr Guleria had said earlier this week.Guleria pointed out that the infection rate has surged and the disease outbreak is compounded by the presence of highly infectious strains. "Earlier, if one sick person was able to infect around 30 per cent of their contacts. This time those getting the disease are infecting a larger number of people,” Guleria told PTI.People are taking the disease lightly now, the chief of India's premier hospital said. "If you go out, you see that marketplaces, restaurants and shopping malls are crowded and full of people and these all are super-spreader events," Guleria said. "Around February, when cases started to decrease, people became lax towards following Covid-appropriate behaviour as they thought the virus had become ineffective… So, the rate of spread of the infection is fast possibly due to the highly infectious and transmissible strains circulating,” he had said.The coronavirus crisis, torpedoing economies and burdening medical infrastructure, worsened at the end of February in India and the country has since been reporting record Covid-19 cases every day.India on Saturday shattered its previous daily spikes in Covid-19 cases recorded since the pandemic hit the country and saw the biggest single-day jump of 2,34,692 fresh Covid-19 infections, pushing the cumulative tally to 1,45,26,609, according to Union health ministry data.The country has more than 16 lakh active cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-crisis-huge-strain-on-india-s-healthcare-system-says-aiims-chief-101618654106310.html

Of this, the highest number of cases come from the capital city Chennai, 2636, and adjoining districts of Chengalpattu (795), Thiruvallur (453) and Kancheepuram (303). Amongst the 37 districts, Coimbatore reported the third-highest number of cases with 583 fresh cases.On Friday, Tamil Nadu’s chief secretary Rajeev Ranjan held a meeting with health officials to discuss control measures. “The numbers seem higher than what we saw during a peak last year. Cases are increasing in Chennai in the past three days in the second wave where we have had more than 2,000 new cases every day,” said Greater Chennai Corporation commissioner G Prakash. “Last June we were touched testing 10,000 samples in a day. Now we are testing close to 20,000 samples in a day. We are aiming to increase it to 25,000 samples,” he said. The state is also conducting a high number of RT-PCR tests. On Friday, 95,561 people were tested and their samples were sent to 263 labs across the state. The average positivity rate across the state has been 4.56%. As many as 33 people succumbed to the infection on Friday taking the total toll to 13,032. A total of 4,920 people were discharged. Last year, during the first wave, Tamil Nadu for weeks reported the second-highest caseload in the country. The state managed to bring it down significantly and also reduced its mortality rate. By March 24, 1,636 cases were reported this year in the state. The infections began to rise as Tamil Nadu was at the peak of political activity ahead of the assembly elections which was held on April 6. On polling day, 3,645 fresh cases were reported. At political rallies across the state, though top leaders were masked or in their campaign vehicles, thousands gathered on the ground without wearing masks and with no social distancing. “We don’t know what percentage of cases are attributed to specific sources,” said Prabhdeep Kaur, deputy director, National Institute of Epidemiology. “We need to do epidemiological investigation on the source of infections and clusters to better understand how the disease has spread. We assume that any kind of gathering is a superspreader in general from what we know of the virus so far but it isn’t substantiated by data,” he added.Also read: Those returning from Kumbh will spread Covid-19 like ‘prasad’ - Mumbai mayorAfter elections were over, the state came out with a slew of restrictions to prevent people from gathering in large numbers in public places.

In a series of tweets, Malik claimed the Centre is denying permission to companies willing to sell Remdesivir in the country. "There are 16 export oriented units in our country that have 20 Lakh vials of Remdesivir, since exports are now banned by the government, these units are seeking permission to sell this medicine in our country but the central government is denying the same," he wrote on Twitter."The government says it should be sold only through 7 companies that are producing it. These 7 companies are refusing to take responsibility. This is a decision-making crisis," Malik, who is also the Nationalist Congress Party’s national spokesperson, also said.Malik further highlighted that a quick decision over the issue is the "need of the hour." "While there is a requirement of this medicine and availability too, a quick decision is the need of the hour. This problem must be solved and the vials must be supplied to government hospitals in all states immediately," he added in another tweet.With the unprecedented rise in Covid-19 cases, demand for Remdesivir has also shot up leading to the long queues outside pharmacies. Black marketing of medicine is also on the rise as the government is working to crack down on the illegal selling of the drug. According to medical practitioners, the anti-viral injection that costs between ₹1000 and ₹5,500, depending on the brand, is being sold for ₹30,000 to ₹40,000 in the black market.Maharashtra's food and drug administration (FDA) minister Rajendra Shingane said on Friday said that the state will face a shortage of 12,000 to 15,000 Remdesivir injections.Shingane also said pharmaceutical companies manufacturing Remdesivir have stepped up production but it will take time for the new stock to reach the market.Further blaming companies for the delay in supply of the much sought-after Covid-19 drug, the FDA minister said, “The heads of Remdesivir-making companies had 15 days back assured me to supply around 55,000 vials of the injection. However, till April 15 these companies could provide only 37,000 to 39,000 vials to the state.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-minister-nawab-malik-targets-centre-over-remdesivir-shortage-says-it-asked-companies-to-not-supply-key-drug-101618654001949.html
17-04-2021||India||Past Covid infection does not fully protect people against re-infection: Study||Results of a new study led by researchers of The Mount Sinai School of Medicine suggest vaccination against Covid-19 remains crucial even in young adults who were previously infected.Although antibodies induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection are largely protective, they do not completely protect against reinfection in young people, as evidenced through a longitudinal, prospective study of more than 3,000 young, healthy members of the US Marines Corps conducted by researchers at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and the Naval Medical Research Center.The findings were published in the journal The Lancet Respiratory Medicine."Our findings indicate that reinfection by SARS-CoV-2 in healthy young adults is common," says Stuart Sealfon, MD, the Sara B. and Seth M. Glickenhaus Professor of Neurology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and senior author of the paper."Despite a prior Covid-19 infection, young people can catch the virus again and may still transmit it to others. This is an important point to know and remember as vaccine rollouts continue. Young people should get the vaccine whenever possible since vaccination is necessary to boost immune responses, prevent reinfection, and reduce transmission."The study, conducted between May and November 2020, revealed that around 10 per cent (19 out of 189) of participants who were previously infected with SARS-CoV-s (seropositive) became reinfected, compared with new infections in 50 per cent (1.079 out of 2,247) of participants who had not been previously infected (seronegative).While seronegative study participants had a five times greater risk of infection than seropositive participants, the study showed that seropositive people are still at risk of reinfection.The study population consisted of 3,249 predominantly male, 18-20-year-old Marine recruits who, upon arrival at a Marine-supervised two-week quarantine prior to entering basic training, were assessed for baseline SARS-CoV-2 IgG seropositivity (defined as a 1:150 dilution or greater on receptor binding domain and full-length spike protein enzyme-linked immunosorbent [ELISA] assays.).The presence of SARS-CoV-2 was assessed by PCR at initiation, middle and end of quarantine. After appropriate exclusions, including participants with a positive PCR during quarantine, the study team performed three bi-weekly PCR tests in both seronegative and seropositive groups once recruits left quarantine and entered basic training.Recruits who tested positive for a new second Covid-19 infection during the study were isolated and the study team followed up with additional testing. Levels of neutralising antibodies were also taken from subsequently infected seropositive and selected seropositive participants who were not reinfected during the study period.Of the 2,346 Marines followed long enough for this analysis of reinfection rate, 189 were seropositive and 2,247 were seronegative at the start of the study. Across both groups of recruits, there were 1,098 (45 per cent new infections during the study. Among the seropositive participants, 19 (10 per cent tested positive for a second infection during the study. Of the recruits who were seronegative, 1,079 (48 per cent) became infected during the study.To understand why these reinfections occurred, the authors studied the reinfected and not infected participants' antibody responses. They found that, among the seropositive group, participants who became reinfected had lower antibody levels against the SARS-CoV-2 virus than those who did not become reinfected.In addition, in the seropositive group, neutralising antibodies were less common (neutralising antibodies were detected in 45 (83 per cent) of 54 uninfected, and in six (32 per cent) of 19 reinfected participants during the six weeks of observation).Comparing new infections between seropositive and seronegative participants, the authors found that viral load (the amount of measurable SARS-CoV-2 virus) in reinfected seropositive recruits was on average only 10 times lower than in infected seronegative participants, which could mean that some reinfected individuals could still have a capacity to transmit infection. The authors note that this will need further investigation.In the study, most new Covid-19 cases were asymptomatic -- 84 per cent (16 out of 19 participants) in the seropositive group vs 68 per cent (732 out of 1,079 participants) in the seronegative group -- or had mild symptoms and none were hospitalised.The authors note some limitations to their study, including that it likely underestimates the risk of reinfection in previously infected individuals because it does not account for people with very low antibody levels following their past infection.They strongly suggest that even young people with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection be a target of vaccination since efforts must be made to prevent transmission and prevent infection amongst this group.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/past-covid-infection-does-not-fully-protect-people-against-re-infection-study-101618652207183.html

The move comes days after Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeking the Centre's support in addressing the shortage of oxygen in the state.Drafting the policy for transport of liquid medical oxygen, the railways' ministry has approved the transportation under Roll-on-Roll off scheme and allowed the movement of oxygen to various destinations across states. It said in a circular the staff accompanying liquid oxygen trucks to be loaded on the Ro-Ro service will be charged a second class ticket for the journey and only two people will be allowed to accompany the truck. "The matter has been examined. The competent authority has approved the transport of liquid medical oxygen in cryogenic containers," the circular said, detailing the charges to be levied for the service.The empty flow direction of the containers will also be charged by the railways. Additionally, free time of five hours will be given to the trucks at the time of loading and unloading.Maharashtra, crippled by the second wave of the coronavirus pandemic, is facing a crisis with the medical and health infrastructure collapsing under the weight of rising cases and deaths.With several states reporting a shortage of oxygen, the government on Friday directed them to ensure uninterrupted movement of medical oxygen carrying vehicles along their borders and said they must not impose any curb on production and supply of the essential public health commodity anywhere.In a bid to save medical oxygen, Maharashtra's Covid-19 task force chairperson Dr Sanjay Oak has suggested that non-essential surgeries be postponed. He said the decision on this, however, would have to be taken at a local level as factors such as the patient's condition and medical urgency are paramount. Amid a spike in Covid-19 cases, there is a reported shortage of medical oxygen in some parts of the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/railways-allow-transport-of-liquid-medical-oxygen-after-request-from-maharashtra-101618646570653.html

Assuring the states of adequate and unhindered supply of vaccines, the minister said a change in the containment strategy may yield results."We can now focus on bigger containment zones which can be called community quarantine to change the strategy," the minister said as he addressed the state health ministers through a video conference.Broaching the vaccine situation of the country, as Odisha, Andhra Pradesh have flagged the issue of vaccine scarcity in recent times, the health minister said till now, the Centre has supplied 14.15 crore doses to all states and UTs, out of which about 12.57 crore doses have been consumed. Another batch of 1.58 crore doses will be reaching the states in one week, the health minister said. "I am quoting these numbers so that there is no misconception about vaccine availability. I am giving you all the numbers," Vardhan said.Clarifying how the Centre supplies vaccines to the states, the minister said that large states get 4 days' supply together while for smaller states, it is seven day's supply. "So either on every 4th day or every 7th day, vaccines are being supplied."The meeting comes as the Covid-19 situation in the country is worsening amid reports of shortage of vaccines, medical oxygen, hospital beds. On Saturday, the BKC jumbo Covid-19 vaccination centre was shut temporarily owing to the shortage of vaccines.At present, there are over 18 lakh Covid-19 beds in the country, the minister said and urged the states to strengthen the health workforce immediately."We have been doing genome sequencing before this UK variant came to the world's notice. We have been doing everything required to bring the situation under control. This year, we have vaccine to bolster our fight," the health minister said urging states to send more samples for genome sequencing.The unprecedented surge in the number of daily infections has forced many states to bring back restrictions, while Prime Minister Narendra Modi too emphasised on the need of micro-containment zones, without imposing lockdown in a larger scale.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vaccine-supply-on-4th-or-7th-day-health-minister-harsh-vardhan-on-reports-of-covid-19-jab-shortage-101618651706536.html

"As the economy has barely begun to turn around from the impact of the earlier lockdowns, we should avoid introducing another lockdown or even a partial lockdown in the states," he said in the letter."Resorting to such a drastic measure at this stage may not be conducive to the overall situation and will push the economy into downward spiral."This letter is written to chief ministers of Delhi, West Bengal, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan, Tripura, Meghalaya, Jharkhand, Himachal Pradesh, Telangana, Goa, Puducherry, Arunachal Pradesh, Haryana, J&K, Odisha, Sikkim, Kerala, Manipur, Bihar, Nagaland, Mizoram, Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Assam and Tamil Nadu.Instead of lockdown or partial lockdown, the letters further suggests that states take steps like ramping up to covid testing, awareness drive and enforcement of Covid appropriate behaviour like wearing masks, physical distancing and personal hygiene.Support may be taken by involving volunteers from the schools, colleges and the NGOs. Strict compliance to Covid protocol may be ensured with suitable penalties for violations.FICCI has represented to the Union Government to open up the vaccination for all the people above 18 years of age to give a massive push to the vaccination drive as there is no shortage of vaccines and the inoculation capacity can be increased with the participation of the private sector."The state government will have to play a major role to encourage people to come forward for vaccination and build capacities with the help of private sector for the expected jump in inoculation," wrote Shanker in the letter."Vaccination camps in the colonies and societies with the help of resident welfare associations (RWAs) will also help push the vaccination drive," the letter added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ficci-writes-to-25-cms-appeals-against-further-covid-19-lockdowns-101618648326550.html

Trying to help as many people as possible, I’m in the hospital myself handling Twitter requests too so kindly tag and DM me both so I don’t miss out on any request. We are all in this together and will come out stronger.” Siddique, who is the general secretary of the Mumbai Youth Congress, tweeted.Using the hashtag #SOSIYC, president Indian Youth Congress, BV Srinivas, also appealed to the people to tag or send him a direct message regarding the medical requirements and the address of the concerned patient.Within no time hundreds of people from across India started tagging the IYC handle and its members asking for help and soon photos of Congress workers reaching out to people with medicines went viral.Speaking to Hindustan Times, BV Srinivas said that former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi had instructed that in case of a shortage, the Youth Congress leaders in Delhi should coordinate with the state and district leaders to ensure that no one faces any difficulty in acquiring a hospital bed or medicines.Calling it a ‘ritual to help people in a calamity’, Srinivas added that till now the IYC has reached out to as many as 2,000 people across the country and provided them with medicines and arranged hospital beds for them.“There is a force of almost 1,000 youth Congress workers who are working on it right now. We have created teams who first segregate the complaints on the basis of the states they come from. Later, the complaints are forwarded to the local district president who makes the necessary arrangement,” Srinivas said.While praising the Congress workers for managing the funds for these medicines, Srinivas added that there were places where the workers couldn’t procure the medicines locally.‘In the cases where we can’t procure the medicines locally, we are arranging them in Delhi and later sending them to the places where it is not available.” Srinivas said.“Just want to say, thank YOU @zeeshan_iyc. For your very many acts of service through this pandemic. Your team has gone above and beyond serving distress calls and providing free medication to anyone who has reached out. Thank you for being the kind of leader our country needs,” activist Trisha Shetty tweeted while thanking the IYC for the help.Another Twitter user Nazia Naseem thanked the IYC leaders for their help and wrote, “When messiahs rise to save your soul in the wee hours of the night! @srinivasiyc @Devendra_1925, a million thanks for being the saviour and arranging medical help for my father in law in Bhilai. Allah bless you always.”“My brother got access to two vials at no cost due to prompt response and help by @zeeshan_iyc. Thank you so much for immediate assistance in our time of need. Shall always be grateful to you for your generosity,” tweeted another user.“Helped me procure Remdesivir for my ailing parents at a time when the drug is more valuable and scarcer than gold dust. Keep up the great work and may God bless you both. Thank you!” Vedala, another beneficiary, posted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-youth-wing-reaches-out-to-needy-covid-19-patients-with-medicines-101618650980707.html
17-04-2021||India||'Despite a year to prep for Covid, we were caught off guard again': Sonia Gandhi||Accusing the Modi government of "gross unpreparedness" and "adhocism" in dealing with the Covid-19 crisis, Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Saturday made a slew of suggestions to the Centre to deal with the pandemic such as reducing the immunization age to 25 years and providing income support to people.In her opening remarks, while chairing the meeting of the Congress Working Committee (CWC), Gandhi also accused the Centre of giving preferential treatment to some states while maintaining "thundering silence" on requests of states ruled by the Congress and opposition parties.The Congress has always believed that fighting the Covid-19 pandemic is a national challenge that should be kept above party politics, she asserted."We have extended our hands of cooperation right from February-March, 2020. We cannot, however, lose sight of the fact that the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic has hit the country with fury. Despite a year to prepare, we have, regrettably, been caught off guard again," Gandhi said.Instead of listening to the constructive suggestions of the opposition, Union ministers are pressed into service to attack leaders of opposition for giving those suggestions, she said."This convoluted 'me versus you' debate is childish and totally unnecessary," Gandhi asserted.Making a host of suggestions to the government, she said the Centre must also reconsider its priority for vaccine candidates by reducing the immunization age to 25 years and above as also all younger persons with at-risk health disorders like asthma, angina, diabetes, kidney and liver diseases and other similar ailments."In the course of my talks with our chief ministers, the question of GST (Goods and Services Tax) came up. They felt that as a preliminary measure, all equipment, instruments, medicines and support required to prevent and treat COVID-19 should be made free from GST," Gandhi said.It is a matter of grave concern that life saving drugs like Remdesivir and medical oxygen as also other basic supplements are subjected to 12 per cent GST, the Congress chief said."As the central and state governments move ahead to control the situation by resorting to partial curfews, travel restrictions, closure and lock downs; we will again be restricting economic activity that will hit the already beleaguered people, especially the poor and the daily wagers," she said.It is, therefore, imperative to provide monthly income support and transfer an amount of ₹6,000 in every eligible citizen’s account, Gandhi said.Taking on these challenging times as Indians rather than as political opponents will be true 'Rajadharma', she stressed.The CWC meet was also attended by former party chief Rahul Gandhi, general secretaries, other permanent invitees and state in-charges of the party.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/despite-a-year-to-prep-for-covid-we-were-caught-off-guard-again-sonia-gandhi-101618649906753.html
17-04-2021||India||Haryana deputy CM writes to PM Modi; urges him to resume talks with farmers||Haryana deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala on Saturday wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and urged him to resume talks with farmers' unions assembled at Delhi borders."Our 'Annadattas' are on roads at Delhi border agitating in respect of newly enacted three farm laws of the Central Government. It is a matter of concern that such agitation is going on for more than hundred days. I truly believe that every problem has a solution by way of mutual discussion," Chautala said in a letter.He asked PM Modi to constitute a committee of three to four cabinet members to hold talks with the agitating farmers."The earlier discussion between the Central Government and farmers' union brought few solutions to the concerns raised by Sayunkt Morcha. In this regard, a team consisting of three to four senior cabinet ministers may lead the delegation for resuming talk with farmers so as to bring an amicable conclusion in this issue," he added.Chautala said that Haryana is the only state in the country where a total of six crops including wheat, mustard, pulses, gram, sunflower and barley are purchased at Minimum Support Price (MSP). "I am sure that with the support of the Central Government, procurement of crops from farmers at MSP in Haryana would continue with the same pace in future also," he added.Thousands of farmers, mostly from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, have been camping at three Delhi border points -- Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur for over four months, demanding a repeal of the three agricultural reform laws enacted by the Centre last September.The government says that the new farm laws will free farmers from middlemen, giving them more options to sell their crops. The farmers, however, say the laws would pave the way for eliminating the MSP and do away with the ''mandi'' (wholesale market) system, leaving them at the mercy of corporates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/haryana-deputy-cm-writes-to-pm-modi-urges-him-to-resume-talks-with-farmers-101618649229669.html

He remained in a critical condition and was on cardiac and respiratory support at the hospital’s Intensive Care Unit. Vivek underwent an emergency coronary angiogram and angioplasty after he was found to have a 100% blockage in his left coronary artery.“This is an acute coronary syndrome with cardiogenic shock,” said a statement from the hospital. “This is a separate cardiac event and may not be due to Covid vaccination.”On Friday also, Tamil Nadu health secretary J Radhakrishnan clarified that Vivek’s cardiac condition is not linked to his Covid vaccination on Thursday.Vivek received his first dose of Covaxin at a government health facility in Chennai.Radhakrishnan said 860 people got the vaccine on the same day. “There is no direct link between his 100% blockage and this. We conducted a test on him today [Friday] and it is [Covid-19] negative. Even his CT scan did not show any symptoms of COVID-19,” Radhakrishnan said. “The vaccine reaction normally comes within 30 minutes; it is called an anaphylactic shock. This [Vivek’s] case is not that...” After getting the vaccine, Vivek also urged the public to get vaccinated.He had been involved in awareness campaigns including those related to dengue.Vivek is survived by his widow and two daughters.Tributes poured in for Vivek as the news of his death broke. In a tweet, Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s said: “The untimely demise of noted actor Vivek has left many saddened. His comic timing and intelligent dialogues entertained people. Both in his films and his life, his concern for the environment and society shone through. Condolences to his family, friends and admirers. Om Shanti.”Vivek made his mark as a comedian and was known to infuse social themes and messages in his comic roles.

It has no proper vaccination strategy and no oxygen strategy,” a Congress functionary quoted Gandhi as saying in his brief speech at a meeting of the Congress Working Committee (CWC). The meeting of the Congress’ top executive body was going on when this report was filed.There was no immediate response to Gandhi’s comments.At least two leaders, Digvijaya Singh and Pramod Tiwari, seconded Gandhi. Tiwari, who was the fifth speaker at the meeting, maintained Gandhi had predicted all these Covid-related developments last year. Also read: ‘Me vs you debate childish, focus on battling Covid-19’ - Sonia takes on CentreSingh, the former chief minister of Madhya Pradesh, echoed him. “Every word that Rahul Gandhi has said since February last has proved to be true.” Earlier, Congress president Sonia Gandhi made her opening remarks.

In the virtual meeting, leaders including former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, former Union ministers AK Antony, Ghulam Nabi Azad, P Chidambaram, Anand Sharma, and Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot have spoken so far. According to party functionaries, there have not been any disruptions or chaos so far. This is the first time the CWC has called a meeting exclusively to discuss the situation arising out of the pandemic. The second wave of Covid-19 has affected 14.3 million people in India, roughly accounting for 10% of the global cases. According to a senior leader, the CWC might officially ask for vaccination for everyone and a faster pace of inoculation in India. The previous CWC was held in January and the meeting grabbed headlines as senior leaders sparred over the demand for elections to CWC and Central Election Committee.

17-04-2021||India||India is fighting double mutant virus variant. Should we worry?||As India’s daily tally of Covid-19 infections surge by a record 200,000-plus cases for three consecutive days, public health experts worry that a new -- possibly more virulent -- coronavirus variant could be racing through the crowded nation of more than 1.3 billion people.The new variant, which has a so-called double mutation, is thought to be fueling India’s deadlier new wave of infections that has made it the world’s second worst-hit country, surpassing Brazil, and has already begun to overwhelm its hospitals and crematoriums. The Asian nation has reported more than 14.5 million Covid cases so far and more than 175,600 fatalities.“This is a variant of interest we are following,” Maria Van Kerkhove, the World Health Organization’s technical lead officer on Covid, told reporters Friday. “Having two of these mutations, which have been seen in other variants around the world, are concerning,” she said, adding that there was a similarity with mutations that increase transmission as well as reduce neutralization, possibly stunting the ability of vaccines to curb them.The new strain underscores the insidious nature of viruses and threatens to thwart containment efforts in India, despite stringent measures such as the world’s largest lockdown last year. An exploding outbreak in India risks undoing a hard-won victory over the pathogen for others too, especially as this strain has now jumped to at least 10 other countries.Here’s what we know so far:How did the “double mutation” variant emerge?The new variant, called B.1.617, was initially detected in India with two mutations -- the E484Q and L452R. It was first reported late last year by a scientist in India and more details were presented before the WHO on Monday, according to Van Kerkhove.Viruses mutate all the time, as part of evolutionary biology. Some mutations weaken the virus while others may make it stronger, enabling it to proliferate faster or cause more infections.India’s health ministry first acknowledged the presence of such a “double mutant” at the end of March, but has downplayed it since. While it’s a variant of interest, it “has not been stamped as a ‘variant of concern’ so as to say that it is more lethal or more infectious,” Aparna Mukherjee, a scientist at the Indian Council of Medical Research, which works under the nation’s health ministry, told Bloomberg TV on Friday.The double mutation has been found in several countries like Australia, Belgium, Germany, Ireland, Namibia, New Zealand, Singapore, the UK and the US, according to an April 16 statement from the Indian government. “Higher transmissibility of this variant is not established as yet,” it said.Is it causing the record surge in infections in India?Genome sequencing indicates the variant as a possible culprit although the Indian government hasn’t confirmed it.The average prevalence of the variant surged to as high as 52% of samples sequenced in April from almost nothing in January, according to website tracker outbreak.info, which uses data from global repository GISAID.In some districts in Maharashtra state -- home to the nation’s financial hub Mumbai and epicenter of the current wave that’s currently under lockdown-like rules -- the prevalence of this variant was more than 60%, according to Anurag Agrawal, director of the state-run Council of Scientific and Industrial Research’s genomics institute that’s conducting sequencing. The B.1.617 was present in samples from about 10 Indian states and while the percentage may vary, it was expected to rise as “it has two critical mutations that make it more likely to transmit and escape prior immunity,” Agrawal said.Both mutations are known to decrease -- although not completely eliminate -- the binding of the antibodies created by infection and vaccination, according to Jesse Bloom, an associate professor for genome sciences and microbiology at the University of Washington.“Mutations at sites E484 and L452 have been observed separately, but this is the first major viral lineage that combines the two,” said Bloom. “I do think that this new viral variant is important to monitor.”“We did the math -- we do believe that a lot of the increase in the reproduction number can be explained by these mutations,” Nithya Balasubramanian, the head of health care research at Bernstein India, told Bloomberg TV this week. “So, yes, the mutations are a big cause for worry.”After being complacent in mapping virus genomes in recent months -- India did sequencing for less than 1% positive samples as of last month -- the country is now scrambling to cover lost ground. “We are attempting to do at least 5% of whatever samples are there,” said ICMR’s Mukherjee.“It looks like that it is spreading faster than pre-existing variants,” said Rakesh Mishra, the Hyderabad-based director of the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology -- another Indian lab doing genome sequencing of Covid samples. “Sooner or later, it will become prevalent in the whole country, given the way it is spreading.”Has it been found outside India?This variant has been detected in at least 10 other countries, including the US, the UK, Australia and New Zealand, according to the situation report on outbreak.info.As of April 16, 408 sequences in the B.1.617 lineage have been detected of which 265 were found in India, the report shows. A surveillance report by the UK government said it has found 77 cases in England and Scotland so far, designating it as a “Variant Under Investigation.”New Zealand has temporarily suspended arrivals of its citizens and residents from India due to the spike in the number returning with Covid. Brazil was also shunned as a Covid superspreader by its neighbors who were nervous about the virus strain next door.India’s second wave -- given its size and rapid pace -- will worry other nations that have just about managed their own outbreaks after weeks of economy-devastating lockdowns.Is it deadlier than other variants out there?Researchers are still trying to figure that out. The features of the double mutant variant are under investigation, but the L452R mutation is well characterized in US studies, according to Agrawal. It increases viral transmission by around 20% and reduces antibody efficacy by more than 50%, he said.Globally, three worrisome variants that have so far emerged in the UK, South Africa and Brazil have caused particular concern. Studies suggest they are more contagious, and some evidence points to one of them being more deadly while another drives reinfections.This double mutant strain, first found in India, has begun troubling virologists everywhere.“The B.1.617 variant has all the hallmarks of a very dangerous virus,” William A. Haseltine, a former professor at Harvard Medical School wrote in Forbes on April 12. “We must do all that is possible to identify its spread and to contain it.”Do vaccines work against it?It’s hard to know for sure without adequate data and research. India is testing whether the new variants, including the B.1.617, are capable of “immune escape or not,” according to ICMR’s Mukherjee.Immune escape refers to a pathogen’s ability to evade human bodies’ immunity response. This means antibodies created after vaccination or prior infection may not protect a person from getting infected. If the new India variant shows “immune escape” behavior, this would have deep ramifications for India’s vaccination program, which has picked up after a sluggish start and administered almost 120 million doses so far.India has currently authorized three vaccines. Two of them are already in use while the third, Russia’s Sputnik V, was approved this week. India also fast-tracked approval for foreign vaccines this week. All of these efforts risk being jeopardized if the shots turn out to be less effective against this double mutation variant.“It is one of the ones that’s on our radar, and in doing so, it means it’s on the radar of people around the world,” said Van Kerkhove.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-is-fighting-double-mutant-virus-variant-should-we-worry-101618642364632.html

Sonia Gandhi was speaking during the meeting of the Congress Working Committee (CWC) meeting, which was attended by former party chief Rahul Gandhi, general secretaries and state in-charges of the party.As the opposition party exclusively discussed the current Covid-19 situation in the country and steps that need to be taken urgently to check the further spread of the virus, Sonia Gandhi spoke about her letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi after her meeting with chief ministers of Congress-ruled states to take a jibe at the Centre.Also read | Sonia Gandhi reviews efforts to tackle Covid-19 in Congress-ruled states“I have written to the Prime Minister after meeting with them. Our Chief Ministers have spoken to the Prime Minister and written to the concerned minister from time to time pleading for relief. Some of them were left with only a few days of vaccine, no oxygen or ventilators. But there has been thundering silence on the part of the Government. On the contrary some other states have received preferential treatment/relief,” she said. “Instead of listening to the constructive suggestions of the opposition, Union Ministers are pressed into service to attack leaders of opposition for giving those suggestions. This convoluted “me versus you” debate is childish and totally unnecessary,” she added.The Congress president reiterated her point about lowering the immunisation age to 25 years and above “as also all younger persons with at-risk health disorders like asthma, angina, diabetes, kidney & liver diseases and other similar ailments.” She also said Goods and Services Tax (GST) on all equipment, instruments, medicines and support required to prevent and treat Covid-19 should be made free. “It is a matter of grave concern that life saving drugs like Remdesivir etc. and medical oxygen as also other basic supplements are subjected to GST @ 12%. Even basic equipments like Oxymeters and life saving critical equipment like ventilators are subjected to 20% GST.

Naveen Patnaik said he was of the view that states and the Centre needed to align their forces and work together as a team to face the crisis and brought the issue of 'intermittent supply' of Covid-19 vaccine to PM Modi’s notice, reported news agency ANI.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageThe state has administered around 4.7 million vaccines against the coronavirus disease to date, Patnaik said, adding that it has the capacity to administer more than 300,000 doses on a daily basis. "We are getting huge responses from people to get vaccinated. However, intermittent supply is creating a challenge in meeting the demand," he said in the letter, according to ANI.  Bring vaccine in open marketThe Odisha CM demanded that the Covid-19 vaccines be made available outside the government supply chain in the open market so that citizens who can afford them can buy the shots on their own. This would reduce the burden of the government and allow it to focus on the vulnerable sections of society, he said.Approve more vaccinesThe vaccines, which have got approval internationally by credible agencies, should be cleared by the Indian government for use, he said. Russia's Covid-19 vaccine Sputnik V was recently approved by India and the first batch of it will be delivered to the country in April.Ramp up vaccine productionVaccine production units should be ramped up with the help of the Centre and state governments and India's potential in manufacturing vaccines should be utilised to the maximum, he said, adding that the government should "run the extra mile" in extraordinary situations.Big cities with large caseloads should be prioritisedIn his last suggestion, the CM said metropolitan cities that contribute the most to the Covid-19 tally should be prioritised in the country’s vaccination drive and there should be flexibility in the age criteria in these regions. These cities are the "economic nerve centres" of the country, CM Patnaik said, and imposing lockdown here would impact the whole country in terms of "labour movement".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-vaccination-4-suggestions-in-odisha-cm-patnaik-s-letter-to-pm-modi-101618637622591.html

The public prosecutor representing the Delhi Police claimed that Sidhu participated in the protest with the intention to create violence and disregard the national flag and that he was the main instigator of unlawful assembly.Sidhu's counsel told the court that his mere presence did not make him part of unlawful assembly and that he was an honest citizen who was part of a protest.Also read: ‘Was in wrong place at wrong time,’ says Deep Sidhu on R-Day violenceSidhu told the court last week that he did not incite the crowd at Red Fort, where religious flags were hoisted and that he was merely exercising his “fundamental right” to protest.“Right to protest is a fundamental right, that’s why I was there. Neither I indulged in violence, nor did I urge anyone to indulge in the violence,” Sidhu said in his submission to the court.The public prosecutor for Delhi Police countered the claim and said that fundamental rights do not mean that one can harm police officials.Sidhu was arrested on February 9 in connection with the Red Fort violence on January 26 during the farmers' tractor parade against the Centre's three farm laws.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/deep-sidhu-accused-in-january-26-violence-granted-bail-by-delhi-court-101618638128786.html

But unfortunately, despite the fact that we had a woman President and a woman Prime Minister, we have never had a woman Chief Justice of India,” lamented the judge as he addressed the 26th Justice Sunanda Bhandare Memorial Lecture at the national capital.Justice Nariman also expressed hope that the Supreme Court will soon change this fact: “I hope that given the present dispensation, the time for the first woman CJI will not be very far off.”Justice Nariman’s comments echo the views expressed by current CJI SA Bobde a day ago. CJI Bobde, during a hearing in the top court on Thursday, said that the time has come for the country to have its first woman CJI.The apex court currently has five vacancies out of the sanctioned strength of 34 judges. Out of 29 judges, there is only one woman judge.As reported by HT on February 21, a timely elevation of justice BV Nagarathna from the Karnataka high court, could give India its first woman CJI in 2027.On Friday, justice Nariman, while delivering his address, also recalled that justice Bhandare, a former Delhi high court judge who passed away at the age of 52 in 1994, as probably the candidate who could become the first woman CJI. “Unfortunately, life was cruel to her and cut her remarkable career short,” regretted the judge.Justice Nariman spoke on the topic “Great women of history” and named five of them -- Cleopatra, Pope Joan, Razia Sultana, Elizabeth I of England, and Catherine, The Great of Russia. He termed all of them “remarkable” while pointing out that each one of them had to fight with their backs to the wall.“Each one of them was brilliant but none succeeded. It is the only two recent ones who succeeded,” said justice Nariman as he elucidated the historical facts about how Cleopatra, Pope Joan and Razia Sultana were killed because they were women and were not supposed to rule over or preside over the men.“We have had this misogynistic tradition for ages...Women in the history have all started out by being perceived by the other sex as something below the men,” rued the judge, adding it was not before the 16th century when people started accepting that to rule was not the exclusive preserve of men.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/unfortunate-we-ve-never-had-a-woman-cji-justice-nariman-101618623824635.html

All those who have come in contact with me in the last 2-3 days may please get themselves tested,” he tweeted.Earlier in the day, Karnataka chief minister BS Yediyurappa also tweeted that he has tested positive for the viral disease.“Upon having mild fever, today I got tested for Covid-19 and my report has come out positive. Although I am doing fine, I am being hospitalised based on the advise of doctors,” the Bharatiya Janata Party leader tweeted. The 78-year-old was earlier hospitalised in August last year after he tested positive for Covid-19.Senior Congress leader Randeep Singh Surjewala and Shiromani Akali Dal leader Harsimrat Kaur Badal has tested positive.In a tweet, the Congress general secretary said, “I have tested +ve for #COVID19 today morning.” “Anyone who has come in contact with me in the last 5 days, please self isolate & take necessary precautions,” 53-year-old Surjewala, who is a former Haryana minister, said.Badal, a former Union minister, said she had mild symptoms. “I have quarantined myself at home and am taking all the necessary precautions. I would request all those who came in contact with me to isolate and get themselves tested at the earliest,” the 54-year-old SAD MP from Punjab’s Bathinda said.Former Madhya Pradesh chief minister and Congress leader Digvijaya Singh also confirmed that he has turned Covid positive. “My Covid test report is positive. I am currently in quarantine at my Delhi residence...,” said Singh in a tweet in Hindi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/javadekar-among-many-leaders-to-test-covid-19-positive-101618620700934.html
17-04-2021||India||Strong proof Covid-19 mainly spreads through air: Study||Researchers have concluded that there is “consistent” and “strong evidence” to prove the Sars-CoV-2 virus – which causes the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) – is primarily transmitted through air and that this reasoning should alter countries’ mitigation response to the pandemic that has ravaged the world.Studies have previously indicated that the coronavirus can spread through air, but this is the first such analysis that says the “airborne route is likely to be dominant”.In the early days of the pandemic, it was believed that the virus is largely transmitted when large droplets, which are exhaled by those infected, settle on surfaces and contaminate them. Months after the first outbreak was reported in China’s Wuhan, around 200 scientists from 32 nations last July wrote to the World Health Organization, saying there is evidence that the coronavirus is airborne.“The evidence supporting airborne transmission is overwhelming, and evidence supporting large droplet transmission is almost non-existent,” said Jose-Luis Jimenez from the University of Colorado Boulder.“It is urgent that the World Health Organization and other public health agencies adapt their description of transmission to the scientific evidence so that the focus of mitigation is put on reducing airborne transmission,” Jimenez, one of the authors of the study, told PTI.The researchers from the UK, the US and Canada reviewed published scientific studies and cited ten reasons as evidence.Among them is the occurrence of super-spreader events in indoor areas such as choir concerts, cruise ships and care homes, they said. These instances show patterns that are not explained by droplets or fomites [contaminated objects], suggesting the “dominance of aerosol transmission”, said the analysis published in journal Lancet on Thursday.Super-spreader events, cases where one person diagnosed with Covid-19 goes to infect several others, are believed to be among the key reasons why Sars-CoV-2 has infected 138 million people the world over.The cluster of Covid-19 cases aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship in February last year was one of the first examples of a super-spreader event. At least 700 people on the ship were infected during the voyage and its subsequent quarantine off the Yokohama coast in Japan.The Lancet study noted the transmission rate of Sars-CoV-2 is higher indoors than outdoors, and that transmission is greatly reduced by indoor ventilation, suggesting that viral particles survive in the air.According to a study cited in the analysis, silent -- asymptomatic or presymptomatic -- transmission of Sars-CoV-2 from people who are not coughing or sneezing accounts for at least 40%. This, too, indicates that the virus is airborne.(With inputs from PTI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/strong-proof-covid-19-mainly-spreads-through-air-study-101618620446557.html

17-04-2021||India||Variants not leading to false negative test results, says Centre||The Union health ministry said on Friday that coronavirus variants detected in India are no more likely to lead to false negative tests, following a series of reports from several parts of the country of people with Covid-19, often with severe outcomes, testing negative through RT-PCR tests.The government said the kits used for RT-PCR tests check for more than two genes, which makes them less likely to miss a sample if it contains a variant with mutations that change the signature of genes.“The RT-PCR tests being used in India do not miss these mutations as the RT-PCR tests being used in India target more than two genes. Sensitivity and specificity of the RT-PCR tests remains the same as earlier,” the ministry said.The concerns stem from mutations that have in the past seen to cause tests kits to not detect specific genes. The B.1.1.7 variant, first found the in the UK, caused the kits in the country to not detect the S gene due to the deletion of amino acids at locations 69-70 on the virus’s spike protein.Laboratory owners in Delhi say that RT-PCR test kits are updated from time to time and none use the S gene, where clinically significant mutations are seen.“The sensitivity (ability to detect true positive) of even the gold standard RT-PCR test is 70%. Add to that the sheer volume of tests being conducted currently; there could be error in collecting or handling the samples that could lead to a false negative report. It could also be that people get the test soon after exposure or several days after the infection when viral load is low,” said Dr Rajesh Chawla, senior consultant of pulmonology at Indraprastha Apollo hospital.Chawla added it is important that people not mix with others if they have Covid-like symptoms and have tested negative.Doctors from hospitals such as Lok Nayak and All India Institute of Medical Sciences who also handle a bulk of patients agreed. “There are a few cases from across the country where the RT-PCR might be negative but the CT shows presence of Covid-19 symptoms,” said Dr Karan Madan, associate professor at AIIMS.“The RT-PCR test has a sensitivity of 70%, so yes sometimes the infection might be picked up by chest CT even if the RT PCR is negative. The negative result could also be because people get tested a day after coming in contact with a positive person; they should ideally wait for four to five days before getting the test,” said Dr Navin Dang, founder of Dr Dang’s Laboratory.He added, “We use the E gene, N gene, RdRP gene, and ORF gene for our tests. And, as far as I know, most labs use kits that test for two to three genes, reducing the possibility of missing out even the emerging mutations.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/variants-not-leading-to-false-negative-test-results-says-centre-101618610884979.html
17-04-2021||India||Jaishankar, Afghan NSA slam Pak’s ‘negative role’||Pakistan’s role in backing the Taliban and meddling in Afghanistan was criticised on Friday by external affairs minister S Jaishankar and Afghan national security adviser Hamdullah Mohib, who said democratic and constitutional structures created in the war-torn country must be preserved.Without naming Pakistan, both Jaishankar and Mohib referred to the negative role of a “neighbour” of Afghanistan, while participating in a virtual discussion at the Raisina Dialogue. However, their remarks left no one in doubt as to which country they were talking about.Iranian foreign minister Javad Zarif, who also participated in the discussion, was more circumspect but urged the Taliban to join negotiations aimed at ensuring a peaceful and stable Afghanistan.Jaishankar noted that thousands of foreign fighters are still in Afghanistan, and said all stakeholders should buy into a fair and broad-based process aimed at ensuring lasting peace. The resolution in Afghanistan must be supported by all its neighbours and cannot be based solely on “the wishes of the most forceful set of people in that society”, he said.“The neighbours of Afghanistan unfortunately have very often played a very negative role...The neighbours also need to lay off Afghanistan and let the Afghan people do what is in their best interest,” Jaishankar said.Mohib endorsed Jaishankar’s comments about the presence of foreign fighters and said: “It’s not just the withdrawal of foreign troops from Afghanistan, it’s also the withdrawal of foreign fighters from Afghanistan, [whom] the Taliban are working closely with and who are involved in destructive activities in our country and...will remain a threat to the region.”He said everything alleged about the Taliban’s links with a neighbouring country had “become a clear reality” over the past 18 months following the visit of Taliban leaders to their injured fighters and their public discussions.“Any further push would mean that there is direct involvement in Afghanistan by a neighbour, which could be very dangerous. The nationalistic forces in Afghanistan are very upset and angry over this and if this limit is passed, I think there would be huge problems for the said neighbour, in their country by all Afghans who are there and from within Afghanistan,” Mohib said. “There could be a huge blowback effect that I think could be destructive for these neighbours,” he added.The discussion was held against the backdrop of US President Joe Biden’s announcement about the withdrawal of all American forces from Afghanistan by September.Jaishankar dismissed Pakistan’s narrative about being encircled by India and any India-friendly government in Kabul, saying New Delhi’s actions were only aimed at creating power infrastructure, dams, health clinics, and roads. “This is actually an absolute fantasy that somewhere our very presence and our activities there are aimed at Pakistan,” he said.Mohib pointed to the coordination between the Indian and Afghan governments, saying he had spoken to NSA Ajit Doval on Friday morning to assess the situation and to prepare for the dialogue with the Taliban.The Taliban have said they won’t attend a meeting in Turkey this month to decide on Afghanistan’s future until all foreign forces leave the country. Taliban leaders have also spoken of their plans to restore the Islamic emirate they had created in the 1990s.Jaishankar, Mohib and Zarif ruled out the possibility of taking Afghanistan back to the era of the Taliban’s emirate. All three leaders acknowledged that the existing system in Afghanistan wasn’t perfect but said it was preferable to the Taliban’s plans to impose an Islamic system.“The Taliban have no reason to continue their violence in Afghanistan anymore...It’s time for them to make real peace with the Afghan government and become part of the mainstream political society,” Mohib said. “We cannot create a vacuum, Taliban should not be asking for a vacuum. Taliban should start negotiating now with the government and people of Afghanistan, with various groups in Afghanistan,” Zarif said, adding a vacuum would draw in “fighting, violence and a civil war”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jaishankar-afghan-nsa-slam-pak-s-negative-role-101618610480774.html
17-04-2021||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||Is a small brown pill the answer to India’s sudden surge of coronavirus disease (Covid-19, although it seems strange to call it that in 2021) cases?For at least two decades now, a drug called Tamiflu has been used to treat, and in some cases even prevent Avian Influenza or bid flu and H1N1 flu or swine flu. Originally extracted from the Chinese star anise plant, the small molecule oseltamivir has been synthesised since 2006, and is sold under the brand name Tamiflu by Roche (which licensed it from the drug’s discoverer Gilead Sciences). There are generic versions of the drug available in India — including Cipla’s Antiflu — which isn’t surprising. India’s pharmaceutical industry thrives on generic versions of small molecule drugs; the country’s vaccine makers have received a lot of attention over the past year, but India has even more expertise in small molecule drugs than it does in vaccines.Watch: How Covid variants & mass gatherings led to surge of cases in India I HT InsightScientists and pharma companies did try to find a small molecule cure or preventive for Covid-19, an antiviral which can, preferably, be taken orally — but they did not have much luck. With the discovery of a handful of vaccines that work well, interest in such drugs waned even more. But, as a surging second wave threatens to overwhelm the health infrastructure in most large Indian cities — most, reports suggest, have already been overwhelmed — it’s difficult not to think of what might have been if a small molecule therapeutic prophylactic drug for Covid-19 was available. Sure, there’s remdesivir, made affordable by India’s generics companies, and expensive by a thriving black market, but most research studies have shown the drug to be largely ineffective in the treatment of the viral disease. There are also Regeneron’s cocktail of monoclonal antibodies that works well, but the drug is far too expensive, and has also not been approved for sale in India.But there’s the brown pill.This is molnupiravir, an antiviral drug discovered by Ridgeback Therapeutics and developed by it in partnership with Merck. The drug is currently entering Phase 3 trials for people who have early or mild infections. An April 15 update from Merck said that the drug was linked to a lower rate of hospitalisation and death in such patients — but did not really have any effect on those with infections severe enough to require hospitalisation. Molnupiravir works by messing with the genetic code of the virus, causing a slight alteration in its RNA as it replicates, a process that eventually leaves the virus powerless or ineffective. For those with severe enough infections to require hospitalisation, preventing replication does nothing; by then, there’s a very high probability of other complications. The Phase 3 trials will show the degree of protection from hospitalisation and death that the drug provides to those with mild and (or) early infections. The company also plans to launch, later this year, another clinical trial evaluating molnupiravir’s prophylactic abilities. Together, both trials can answer a simple (but important) question: can it be to Covid-19 what oseltamivir is to Influenza A and B?But how does this help India?In late March, in a conversation with Cipla chairman Yusuf Hamied, I brought up the issue of how patents, and the unwillingness of most western nations, including the US, to back a move by India at the WTO to free up Covid-19 vaccines from patents, were probably hurting the world.Hamied’s response — the man is also a scientist, so I listened — was that vaccines “are a different ballgame”. “You can pick up a patent of a vaccine manufacturer, and you still won’t be able to produce it. It’s like biotech. Humira, the world’s top-selling biotech drug (used to treat various kinds of arthritis), is surrounded by 247 patents. I free the patents, but what are you going to do with that?”Instead, he added, there was an opportunity in small molecules (also Cipla’s speciality).According to Hamied, “[Merck has] come to India and given all of us (generics companies) an open licence to produce the drug, which we are planning to do. We have already made 30 kilos in the lab, and we will try to get approval in India. It’s that easy to do.”Even as India enhances supply of and access to vaccines, and even as several states impose lockdown-like restrictions (without calling them that), the health ministry should work with Merck and Cipla, and also with any other company which has a Covid small molecule in late-stage trials to facilitate local trials, and, if they are successful, accelerate a local launch.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-what-you-need-to-know-today-101618609810490.html
17-04-2021||India||After 2 years of rain aplenty, IMD predicts normal monsoon this year||The monsoon for this year is likely to bring the normal amount of rainfall at 98% of the long period average (LPA), the India Meteorological Department said in its forecast on Friday, while adding that there could be a variation of 5% over or under the prediction.India recorded above-average monsoon rains for two consecutive years, and a normal season this year will significantly help the agriculture sector in particular, and the economy in general, following a year when the pandemic has stressed earnings.The summer rains – which typically set in from June 1 — are critical because nearly 60% of India’s net arable land lacks irrigation and nearly half the population depends on a farm-based livelihood. The rains also replenish 89 “nationally important reservoirs” critical for drinking and power generation.The LPA is the average monsoon rainfall — 88 cm — recorded from 1961 to 2010. IMD considers rainfall between 96% to 104% of LPA to be in the “normal” range.In 2020 and 2019, the monsoon was above normal at 110% and 109% of LPA. In 1996, 1997, and 1998, the monsoon was normal at 103.4%, 102.2%, and 104%.There is a 40% probability of normal, 25% of a below-normal, 16% of above-normal, 14% of deficient, and 5% of excess monsoon rains, according to IMD’s forecast. Unlike private weather forecasting agency Skymet Weather’s assessment on Tuesday that monsoon is likely to be a “healthy normal” at 103% of the LPA, IMD’s forecast predicts the monsoon to be at the lower end of its normal LPA range.IMD said a large part of east and northeast India including Jharkhand, Odisha, Bihar, and the north-eastern states are likely to record below normal rains this year. A part of northwest India, including Delhi, Haryana, parts of Punjab, are also likely to record below normal rains.Over the past few years, there has been a huge divergence in monsoon rains across regions, and, even in regions receiving plentiful rain, long dry spells interspersed with intense wet ones.“We have good news to share. After two years of above-average rain, we are likely to receive normal monsoon rain this year,” said M Rajeevan, secretary, the ministry of earth sciences.He added La Niña conditions, which are associated in India with strong monsoon and above-average rains, and colder winters, have started weakening after starting in 2020.“La Niña conditions are likely to prevail only till May so we will transition to ENSO [El Niño and Southern Oscillation] neutral conditions during monsoon. There is very little chance of El Niño conditions developing during monsoon months. There is a very small probability of Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) negative conditions developing during monsoon. So, these conditions are likely to lead to a normal monsoon this year,” Rajeevan said.“The agri sector has been quite resilient. The onus of the government now is to maintain supplies of inputs such as fertilisers and seeds,” said economist R Mani of the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University.The farm sector, which contributes 39% to the rural economy, was able to shake off the impacts of the pandemic last year because of normal rains and ample supplies of subsidised inputs, such as fertilisers.With inputs from Zia Haq||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-2-years-of-rain-aplenty-imd-predicts-normal-monsoon-this-year-101618609303394.html
17-04-2021||India||Govt seeks details of parameters to improve India’s ranking on global Democracy Index||The Union law ministry’s legislative department wrote to several ministries and departments on April 1 seeking details on the parameters used in the rankings of the Economist Intelligence Unit’s Democracy Index, as part of a larger exercise under the aegis of Niti Aayog to monitor parameters used in key global indices including Ease of Doing Business, World Press Freedom, Human Development, Global Innovation, and Global Climate Risk.This, senior officials familiar with the matter said, was with the view of improving India’s rankings on global barometers, including the Democracy Index. In the latest 2020 Democracy Index global ranking released on February 3, India slipped two places to 53rd (out of 167 countries), its overall score fell from 6.9 the previous year to 6.6, and classified India as a “flawed democracy” along with countries including the US, France, Belgium and Brazil.The government’s move to monitor indices, and work on improving rankings, however, precedes the release of index.“…a CoS (committee of secretaries) meeting was held on 30 January, 2020, under the Chairmanship of Cabinet Secretary to discuss India’s ranking in the Global Competitive Indices decided to measure and monitor India’s performance on various important parameters through 32 internationally recognised indices to improve performance on these indices… Accordingly, the Legislative Department had been assigned to monitor India’s performance on the Democracy Index published by the Economic Intelligence Unit of United Kingdom,” the letter written by the law ministry’s legislative department on April 1 said.HT has reviewed a copy of the letter.EIU’s index is based on 60 indicators grouped in five different categories measuring pluralism, civil liberties and political culture. In addition to a numeric score and a ranking, the index categorises each country into one of four regime types: full democracies, flawed democracies, hybrid regimes and authoritarian regimes. The five fields that the government is monitoring for the Democracy Index are electoral process and pluralism, functioning of the government, political participation, democratic political culture, and civil liberties, officials aware of the matter said on condition of anonymity.To be sure, the government’s policy think-tank Niti Aayog is also collecting information on other indices. For instance, in December 2020, it sought inputs from the home ministry on the Global Peace Index. “As part of the exercise to engage proactively for the various indicators in the said Global Peace Index to enable higher ranking for the country it would be necessary to check the correctness of the data in the report,” an internal MHA memorandum issued in December 2020 noted. HT has seen the memo.HT could not immediately ascertain the status of work on monitoring the parameters involved. A detailed questionnaire sent to Niti Aayog remained unanswered.Officials aware of the matter and government documents indicated that after the January 2020 CoS meeting chaired by the cabinet secretary – cited in the April 1 letter -- Niti Aayog’s Development Monitoring & Evaluation Office (DMEO) was tasked with monitoring all the indices, and facilitating the measurement and monitoring of India’s performance on these indices through a single dashboard.Under this, the monitoring of the Democracy Index was assigned to the law ministry’s legislative department. Niti Aayog also assigned indices to other ministries — such as the Safe Cities Index, Global Terrorism Index, Global Peace Index, and Global Climate risk Index to the home ministry; and the Global Gender Gap Index, Global Inequality Index and Global Hunger Index to the ministry of women & child development.The move to monitor global indices goes back to last year.In July 2020, Niti Aayog organised a virtual workshop with 47 central ministries and departments, chaired by Cabinet Secretary Rajiv Gauba in line with a decision by the Centre to monitor India’s performance in select global indices. “The 29 global indices, published by 19 international agencies, are assigned to 18 nodal ministries and departments of the Government of India,” Niti Aayog said in a statement at the time.“It has long been felt that there is a need to measure and monitor India’s performance on various important social, economic and other parameters through internationally recognised Indices. The goal of the exercise is to use these Indices as tools for self-improvement, and bring about reforms in policies, while improving last-mile implementation of government schemes. Simultaneously, it is equally important to present an accurate image of India to the world,” the body added in the statement.It is unclear which three indices were subsequently added to the list, to take the list from 29 to 32.On February 26, Gauba wrote to legislative department secretary DG Narayana Raju seeking inputs for the indicators for the Democracy Index that will be monitored by DMEO. HT has reviewed the letter. Gauba also said a review meeting would be held soon.“As you are aware, DMEO, NITI Aayog has been designated as the knowledge partner for this exercise, and is in process of developing a dashboard through NIC for monitoring activities related to these GIs. I understand that DMEO is yet to receive complete information in the templates shared, including on engagement with Publishing Agencies, MosPI ( Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation) and States/UT. I therefore request you to share the information sought for configuration of the dashboard at the earliest. I have reviewed the progress for some Gls in December 2020, and intend to review the progress in respect of all GIs,” he wrote.On March 1, the law ministry’s legislative department issued a memo to several departments with the subject: “Monitoring Performance on Global Indices Democracy Index” as a reminder to provide inputs for the dashboard. HT has reviewed the memo, which, in light of the Cabinet Secretary’s letter, called for “information as sought for to configure the dashboard immediately without any further delay”. The memo was sent to ministries and departments including the labour ministry, department of legal affairs, DoPT, the I&B ministry, external affairs ministry, and the home ministry.Gauba declined to comment.“Some of these global indices have been there for a long time and they have gone through various levels of scrutiny. For example,V-DEM was established because many academics felt that Freedom House and Polity IV indices were not comprehensive. There is a section within the Indian government that believes in an inherent bias against India in the indices. While this may be true, as these are expert-based indices, but these institutes follow very rigorous protocols and their data is transparent. They provide a detailed breakdown of democracy scores of each country, and we know in the Indian case our rankings are now lower because decline in India’s score largely in the areas of civil liberty. While there is no harm in closely monitoring the indices, I’m not sure if it needs a large Niti Aayog level exercise to monitor these indicators,” said Rahul Verma, fellow at the Centre for Policy Research (CPR), New Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-seeks-details-of-parameters-to-improve-india-s-ranking-on-global-democracy-index-101618608140311.html

Darshan of the Lords by the public/devotee will be allowed only from Bahara Katha of the temple. Devotees have to sanitize their hands before entering the temple and there would be strict enforcement for ensuring Covid-appropriate behaviour,” he said after the meeting that was attended by Puri district collector, SP and officials of Shree Jagannath Temple Administration and senior servitors of the temple.All devotees will be required to bring their photo ID card, namely, Aadhaar/Voter 1D or any other photo ID card for identification. Chewing of Tobacco/ Paan and spitting inside the temple premises have been prohibited. A fine of ₹500 will be levied for each violation.On Thursday, 10 members of the servitor families, five temple employees and 10 staff of the Sri Jagannath Temple shoe stand were found infected with Covid-19.Temple officials said the servitors who had visited Kumbh Mela in Haridwar will have to undergo Covid-19 tests.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/visitors-to-puri-s-jagannath-temple-need-to-show-covid-19-negative-report-to-enter-101618608258750.html

A patrol team at the Baramaniramjote border post area spotted them. “They have been identified as Ding Shou Sheng (36) and Chen Ji Fa (30),” said Girish Chandra Pandey, company commander of SSB’s 8th battalion. “They were trying to cross the border without any valid document,” he added. An Indian national has also been apprehended in this connection. He was identified as Mohammed Ibrahim, a resident of Dohaguri in Darjeeling district. The Indo-Nepal border area comes under the jurisdiction of the Naxalbari police station.

17-04-2021||India||57% of India under curbs as deaths soar on Black Friday||India recorded 1,340 deaths due to Covid-19 in a single day on Friday, setting a new record for daily deaths as the devastating statistics of recent days came into stark focus with a steady stream of bodies pouring into cremation and burial grounds, and people seen lining up in a desperate wait for beds outside hospitals.The country added 233,869 cases on Friday -- the most it ever has in a single day.The crisis has forced much of the country to retreat into some form of curbs, which will restrict more than half of India’s population (57%) to their homes as curbs in 15 states and Union territories come into force in the form of for night or weekend curfews.Prior to Friday, the last time India recorded the most number of deaths in a day was on September 15 when 1,284 people succumbed to the disease. To be sure, on June 16, more than 2,000 deaths were recorded but that was due to Delhi and Maharashtra reconciling pending fatality data in a single day.According to an analysis by HT, over the next two days, more than 700 million people across the country will be under either a curfew for a limited time period or one that extends 24x7 with largely only essential services allowed.Such wide-ranging curfews have been necessitated as India’s second wave of Covid-19 is expanding throughout the country at a never-before-seen pace. For the week ending April 16, India has reported 188,400 new cases every day – this is double of what was seen during the peak of the first wave (93,617 average daily cases for the week ending September 16, 2020).Chhattisgarh, Maharashtra, and Madhya Pradesh have imposed curfews that extend all day long, and on all days of the week. In Maharashtra, the curfew will be imposed in all districts for 15 days. In Chhattisgarh, the restrictions are limited to 20 districts, and in Madhya Pradesh to 15 districts. Weekend curfews will be enforced in Delhi, Chandigarh, Rajasthan, and urban areas of 10 districts in Odisha. Uttar Pradesh has imposed a statewide curfew on Sunday. Night curfews, meanwhile, will be in place in hundreds of districts across the country with six states and UTs – Punjab, Haryana, Delhi, Uttarakhand, Bihar, and Chandigarh – completely shut at night. In Karnataka, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, Jammu & Kashmir and Odisha, night curfews are limited to urban areas or districts reporting large number of cases.Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, and Chhattisgarh are the three worst-affected states in terms of the degree to which their second wave has so far exceeded the first wave peak. The fourth such state is Gujarat, but it has only imposed a night curfew so far. Current weekly average of cases in Chhattisgarh is 410% of the peak of the state’s first wave, this number is 290% for Madhya Pradesh, 265% for Maharashtra.To be sure, most states have only imposed different versions of night curfews. Around 35% of the country’s population is currently under a night curfew. The regions that have only imposed night curfews are Karnataka, Haryana, Punjab, Uttarakhand, Gujarat, Jammu & Kashmir, and Bihar. On April 15, the weekly average of Covid-19 cases in these states was 99%, 157%, 128%, 110%, 398%, 67%, and 103% for their first wave peaks, respectively.Delhi and Chandigarh have also imposed variations of a weekend lockdown in all their administrative regions along with a night curfew. Here the average of cases in the week ending April 15 was 168% and 127% of their biggest peak before the second wave. In Rajasthan and Odisha, the night restrictions extends to urban areas only and in Uttar Pradesh to only 47 districts, but weekend restrictions are statewide. Rajasthan’s weekly average of Covid-19 infections is 168% of its past peak and Uttar Pradesh’s average is 243% of its past peak. Odisha’s current weekly average is only 43% of its last peak. Weekend restrictions of these states make up to almost a quarter (23.8%) of India’s population.In Chhattisgarh, 81% of the population, 34% of Madhya Pradesh’s population, and all of Maharashtra – which totals to 13% of India’s population – is also under restrictions that extend to all days of the week. Additionally, 3% of the population in Chhattisgarh and 28% of population in Madhya Pradesh is also under a night curfew.Experts say such limitations on movement of people will slow down the transmission but the impact of such curfews is not likely to be visible for at least a week, if not several days later still, and that too, only if the progress made due to the curbs is more than whatever transmission of the disease occurs during the hours that mobility is unrestricted.“The weekend curfews will slow down transmission at least during the 48-hour period. Transmission happens from person to person and if mobility is restricted, the transmission will go down. But, it will have a minor impact on the total incidence,” said Dr GC Khilnani, former head of the department of pulmonology at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences. He said any impact on the number of cases will be visible only seven to ten days after the measure is implemented.“If infections reduce by 10% in these two days, but between Monday and next Monday they again increase by 10%, then you will not be able to see the difference the lockdown of this weekend will make. If the infection rate stays down during the week too, then only we will see an impact. If the infection increases in between now and then, then the lockdown will just mask the extent of increase during the week,” said Dr Lalit Kant, former head of the department of epidemiology at the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/57-of-india-under-curbs-as-deaths-soar-on-black-friday-101618605689947.html

The court directed the jail authorities to take proper care of his security.Kazi was subsequently moved to Taloja prison.According to the NIA, Kazi was working as an assistant police inspector in the crime intelligence unit (CIU) and was aware about Vaze’s alleged plans to create a security scare in the vicinity of Ambani’s residence. The agency has claimed that Kazi was aware of the design and the things that transpired later.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vazes-colleague-sent-to-judicial-custody-in-antilia-case-101618601356256.html
17-04-2021||India||Court frames charges against Hooda in AJL case||A special court on Friday framed charges against former Haryana chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda over the alleged illegal allotment of a plot in Panchkula to Associated Journals Limited (AJL), publisher of the National Herald newspaper.The trial court acted on a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) charge sheet filed in December 2018. CBI special judge Sushil Kumar Garg has ordered the framing of charges under Section 120-B (criminal conspiracy) and 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act against Hooda.Hooda was present in court when the charges were framed. Details of the order were awaited at the time of going to press.Congress leader Motilal Vora, who died in December 2020, was also an accused in the case. Another accused arrayed was the firm AJL.At the time of registration of the FIR in 2016, Vora was chairman of AJL and Congress leaders Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi were among the shareholders.The newspaper was launched in 1938 by Jawaharlal Nehru, the first prime minister of the country.The CBI probe said Hooda misused his position to favour AJL. An institutional plot spread over 3,360 square metres in Sector 6, Panchkula, was allotted by the Haryana Urban Development Authority (HUDA) to AJL in 1982. As construction was not carried out in 10 years, it was taken back in 1992.In 1995 and in 1996, an appeal and revisions were filed by AJL against resumption of the plot, but these were dismissed by the HUDA administrator and Haryana’s financial commissioner, Town and Country Planning. When Hooda became chief minister of Haryana in 2005, he allowed re-allotment of the plot to AJL, according to the CBI.The CBI said Hooda, who was also the HUDA chairman, “blatantly misused his official position and dishonestly allotted the plot afresh in the guise of reallotment to AJL at original rates plus interest in violation of the HUDA policy vide an order on August 28, 2005. Thus, he caused wrongful loss to HUDA and wrongful gain to AJL.”In December 2018, the CBI filed a charge sheet against Hooda, Vora and AJL. An Enforcement Directorate probe is also underway in the case.On May 5, 2016, an FIR was registered by the Haryana vigilance bureau regarding allegations of cheating and corruption against Hooda and others. In December 2016, the Haryana government recommended a CBI probe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/court-frames-charges-against-hooda-in-ajl-case-101618601296278.html
17-04-2021||India||Extradition to India cleared, Nirav to appeal||UK home secretary Priti Patel has approved the extradition of fugitive businessman Nirav Modi almost two months after a court found him guilty of fraud and money laundering in the Punjab National Bank scam case, people familiar with the development said on Friday.The decision came as a shot in the arm for the Indian government, which has been trying to bring fugitive economic offenders back to the country, but Nirav Modi reserves the right to appeal his extradition in the high court, which his lawyer said would be the next course of action.“We will now go to the high court challenging the order of the Westminster magistrate court,” Zulfiquar Memon, who represents Nirav Modi, told HT.A UK home office spokesperson said: “On February 25, the district judge gave a judgment in the extradition case of Nirav Modi. The extradition order was signed on April 15.”Nirav Modi now has 14 days to make an application for leave to appeal to the high court. He may seek leave to appeal against both the decisions of the district judge and of the home secretary, the people cited above said.While ordering his extradition on February 25, Westminster district judge Sam Goozee stated that Modi has a case to answer in India as he, along with his brother Nehal Modi and others, had defrauded the public sector bank, laundered the money taken from it and conspired to destroy evidence and intimidate witnesses.The judge observed that the circulation of pearls, diamonds and gold between Nirav Modi firms and Dubai- and Hong Kong-based dummy companies was not genuine business and the companies were being used for transferring funds generated in the guise of sale-purchase/export-import of goods colloquially referred to as round-tripping transactions.Nirav Modi’s contention that he won’t get a fair trial in India and that he was being targeted due to political reasons was junked by the court.A Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) official following the case said, “The UK government signing the extradition order is a positive development. Even if he goes to a higher court, he doesn’t stand a chance as there is very strong evidence against him.”Nirav Modi has been lodged in Wandsworth prison on the outskirts of London since March 19, 2019, when he was arrested on the basis of India’s extradition request.Nirav Modi is the second high-profile economic offender after former liquor baron Vijay Mallya whose extradition has been cleared by a trial court in the UK. Mallya lost his appeal against extradition in April 2020 as well as any opportunity to approach the UK Supreme Court the next month but the British government has claimed that his extradition is held up due to a “confidential legal issue”.Officials familiar with the Mallya case say that he has applied for asylum in the UK and it is not known how much time British authorities will take to decide.CBI and Enforcement Directorate (ED) investigators are confident that the UK high court will reject Nirav Modi’s plea just as it did Mallya’s, as there is irrefutable evidence of fraud and money laundering.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uk-approves-nirav-modi-s-extradition-101618601176345.html

In case they choose the latter, the board will develop a fair and unbiased criterion while preparing the results of such candidates,” said Gerry Arathoon, chief executive and secretary of the board, in the release.Parents welcomed the decision and said it would help students who have already decided their future options escape the uncertainty of exams. “Many students wish to take admission in small science colleges run by coaching classes where they are already studying. There are also quite a few who wish to continue in their respective schools. For such students, internal assessments will be the best possible solution. Students who wish to take the exams can still do so,” said a parent from Andheri.Over 23,000 students from Maharashtra took the ICSE exam in 2020 while 3,150 wrote their ISC exams last year. This year, ICSE exams were earlier scheduled between May 5 and June 7 and ISC exams were to be held between May 5 and June 16.Meanwhile, parents of students from the Cambridge (IGCSE) board are anxious about the board’s decision regarding exams. While the board is going to clear its stand on the exams by Monday, parents are worried as students are scheduled to appear for their ICT paper on Tuesday. “The board should come up with a decision in this regard immediately. Our children are still studying rigorously because they don’t know if the examination is happening or not. Their peers have been able to relax as their exams have been postponed or cancelled. Nothing is going to change over the weekend and the board should take a quick decision,” said a parent of IGCSE.Alka Sharma, a parent from Santacruz said, “I do not want my daughter to wait in anxiety until a day before exams. I really hope the board comes up with a decision to cancel the exam soon.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/icse-postpones-board-exams-for-class-10-12-amid-covid-19-surge-101618601116225.html
17-04-2021||India||Strong rooms lack security: Stalin to EC||The fight over electronic voting machines (EVM) security has started with opposition leader and DMK president M K Stalin on Friday alleging that there was total failure of security protocol of strong rooms, where the EVMs are kept and urged the election commission to take quick remedial measures.In a letter to the election commission, Stalin said a covered vehicle was brought into three different premises during night hours -- GCT College in Coimbatore on April 13, Sri Ram Engineering College in Tiruvallur on April 14 and Loyola College in Chennai on April 15.The strong room in Loyola stores EVMs from the city’s Kolathur constituency from where Stalin contested. Stalin said in all three instances when his party and alliance candidates questioned authorities they were told that these were mobile toilets brought in for women police.“Every strong room is located only in reputed colleges, where adequate lavatory facilities are available. While so, it is not known as to why the so-called mobile toilets are brought inside the strong room, in utter violation of the instructions issued by the Election Commission,” Stalin wrote to chief election commissioner Sushil Chandra. “These incidents have created high suspicion over the security/protocol provided in the strong room premises and thereby the safety of the polled EVMs is in question.”“Though the election commission constantly claims that EVMs cannot at all be hacked or tampered; the above attempts of making way to such hacking or tampering will make us disbelieve your statement. If such hacking or tampering of EVMs takes place, it will certainly demolish the structure of democracy...,” he said.Chief electoral officer Satyabrata Sahoo did not respond to calls and messages. Additional CEO V Rajaraman acknowledged that they have received a complaint.Tamil Nadu went to polls on April 6 and counting will be held on May 2. EVMs have been stored across 75 strong rooms in the state.AIADMK spokesperson C Vaigaichelvan said: “The election commission has strengthened strong rooms with a three tier-security so it is impossible for any malpractice.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/strong-rooms-lack-security-stalin-to-ec-101618600998537.html

The test positivity rate has also gone up to 14.8 per cent, according to the data released by the state health ministry. The state also reported 21 deaths taking the toll to 4,877. The active caseload has also risen to 69,868 and 32 health workers are among those infected. The maximum number of cases were reported from Kozhikode district—1,560 followed by Ernakulum with 1,391 cases. In the last 24 hours, 76,775 samples were tested in the state. With Covid-19 cases rising steadily after the assembly elections in the state, the government had announced two sets of restrictions this week and decided to hike tests considerably to contain the surge. It had devised a three-pronged strategy--more tests, effective enforcement of norms and beefing up of the vaccination drive. Though Kerala has planned 2.50 lakh tests in the next two days, health officials admitted that it was difficult to meet the target in the prevailing situation. Despite mounting cases the government made it clear that there won’t be a complete lockdown in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/keralas-covid-19-woes-continue-as-state-clocks-10-031-new-cases-after-6-months-101618600996842.html
17-04-2021||India||DMK slams govt over changing road names||Chennai Blaming the ruling All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) for changing names of three important arterial roads in Tamil Nadu, the opposition Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) on Thursday sought the chief secretary’s intervention for restoring the old names. The roads pointed out by the DMK were previously named after Dravidian icons of the state like EV Ramasamy, CN Annadurai and K Kamaraj, but now bear English names. On Thursday, a three-member delegation of the DMK led by organising secretary and MP RS Bharathi submitted a representation to chief secretary Rajeev Ranjan, urging him to intervene to roll back names of the roads. “It is common knowledge that some of the major roads and highways in Chennai are named after the greatest leaders of Tamil Nadu. This was a policy decision taken by the then government,” stated the DMK delegation’s letter to the chief secretary, which was also shared with the press. “The move to change the names of the roads will insult Tamil personalities belonging to various political parties and create a tense and unrest situation in the state and may lead to further struggles and unrest,” the letter added. In the past, both DMK and AIADMK have indulged in changing the names of roads after Tamil scholars and personalities to evoke a linguistic pride. Chennai’s Poonamallee High Road was renamed in 1979 by AIADMK founder MG Ramachandran (MGR) into EVR Periyar High Road after EV Ramasamy, the father of the Dravidian movement. Similarly, Mount Road was renamed as Anna Salai and Beach Road as Kamarajar Salai. The DMK in its letter said that names of these roads have now been changed to Grand Western Trunk Road, Grand Southern Trunk Road and Grand Northern Trunk Road, respectively. The DMK has sought for the old names to be restored. “This action of changing the names of the roads, and the sheer disrespect to Tamil icons cutting across all parties has brought uneasiness and unrest in the state and may even lead to agitations,” Bharathi said in his letter. “It is quite apparent that the name change is done to please the ideologies of the AIADMK’s masters from the north, whose dislike of the Dravidian movement and its icon Thanthai Periyar is well known. Their aim is to ‘saffronise’ everything,” the letter added. The AIADMK, however, said that no names have been changed. “It seems the highways department used names from old records and during a routine job of erecting name boards, they have done this,” AIADMK spokesperson C Vaigaichelvan said, adding, “We don’t have the power to do anything now. After we form the government again, we will take necessary steps.” He dismissed DMK’s charges that this was done to appease their ally, the Bharatiya Janata Party. “BJP doesn’t tell us to change any name and we won’t do such things. We are also for Periyar. What do we have against these road names?”Meanwhile, former Union minister and senior Congress leader P Chidambaram on Friday night tweeted that a smart government would immediately let leaders know that names of the highways have not been changed. “The controversy should end tonight,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dmkslams-govt-over-changing-road-names-101618600936935.html
17-04-2021||India||Concerns over Remdesivir shortage grow||BengaluruReports of a shortage of remdesivir injections increased in Karnataka as the number of cases of the coronavirus disease in the state continued a relentless surge.According to medical practitioners, the anti-viral injection that costs between ₹1000 and ₹5,500, depending on the brand, is being sold for ₹30,000 to ₹40,000 in the black market.The managing director of Harsha Hospital in Bengaluru, S Shivakumar, said they have been unable to replenish the stocks at the hospital’s medical store. “We have been enquiring for the injection from the past 10 days to which, they (companies and wholesale dealers) have been replying with no stock,” Shivakumar told HT.According to the national treatment protocol, Remdesivir is one of the investigational drugs approved for use in treating hospitalized Covid-19 patients. With the rising cases, the demand for the drug has also shot up. To be sure, most studies have shown the drug has no real effect and it has been removed from the treatment protocol in many countries.Families of people undergoing treatment for the viral disease were forced to pay double the price for the injections.“My uncle who is Covid positive needed the injection. We got the first shot from the hospital. But the second, third and fourth doses were not available at the hospital. We were told to contact some private parties who would provide us the vial and they charged ₹40,000 for the first injection and ₹30,000 for the second and the third. Even in the black market we were unable to get two more injections, so we shifted him to Hyderabad,” said a relative of a patient in Bidar. The maximum retail price per vial for various brands of Remdesivir varies. One vial of Hetero costs is ₹5,400, Mylan ₹4,700, Jubliant ₹4,700, Reddy’s ₹5,400, Cipla ₹4,000 and Zydus ₹899. Mohammed Fahad, coordinator of the National Students Union of India, said, “I was trying to procure the injection for a friends’ mother. I went to multiple hospitals, but the injection was out of stock. One medical store owner gave me a number who could provide the medicine, when I called him, the perspn asked for ₹7,500 per dose which is close to double the price. We were able to find the medicine at MRP after searching further.” He, however, questioned how middlemen were able to procure the drug if hospitals were running out of stocks.Medical practitioners in the state have sought government action against the black-market trading of the drug.Shivakumar said he has written to chief minister BS Yediyurappa seeking a police investigation.“I was made aware of the fact that certain people are selling the injection in the black market illegally. The Hetero Remdesivir 100mg injection of 20 ml, which is to be sold for ₹1,500 to 2,000 is being sold for ₹15,000 to 25,000. Hence, kindly enquire and verify about other batches of the injections as well,” he wrote in the letter to the CM. On Thursday, Karnataka home minister Basavaraj Bommai warned of action against those spreading rumors about the shortage.  “The Karnataka Health Minister has already said there is no scarcity of Remdesivir injection in the state, but a false scarcity is been created in the state. The government has taken the matter seriously and will initiate stringent action against those who are making a fast buck by creating false scarcity and black marketing this important drug. We will monitor at every level of supply, storage and distribution of Remdesivir. We will keep track right from pharmaceuticals to the hospitals and initiate action under the Epidemic Act,” he said in a statement.A senior official of the Bengaluru police said that teams have been formed to crack down on the black-market sales of the injections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/concerns-over-remdesivir-shortage-grow-101618600816251.html
17-04-2021||India||Police launches helpline to curb online fraud||Bengaluru: After the success of a pilot project, the Bengaluru police have launched a helpline, the Cybercrime Incident Report (CIR) system, to address online fraud complaints. Bengaluru Police commissioner Kamal Pant explained that as per the new initiative, launched in the first week of April, any victim of online financial fraud can lodge a complaint by calling a police helpline number. “Based on the information provided by complainants, the police will work with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and freeze the account to which the money has been transferred,” he said. According to National Crime Records Bureau data, in 2019, Bengaluru recorded the highest number of cybercrimes among all metro cities in India with 10,668 cases. The city closest to Bengaluru was Mumbai, which reported 1,482 cybercrimes that year. Among the cybercrimes in the city, phishing, smishing and vishing have been a big concern for both citizens and the police. According to experts, phishing is a type of financial fraud where criminals defraud, dupe or mislead people through email. The number of phishing emails have risen in the past few years and have got a lot more sophisticated, experts said. ‘Vishing’ is over-the-phone phishing, where scammers try to persuade people to share information by posing as bank staff or other financial service employees. ‘Smishing’ is SMS phishing where text messages are sent trying to encourage people to pay money out or click on suspicious links. In the current system, if a person loses their money in an online fraud or phishing, they have to approach a police station or one of the dedicated cybercrime police stations in the city. This is a time-consuming process and any delay in such cases could make the recovery of the money difficult, experts added. A pilot project was launched in the last week of December 2020, which was deemed success by the Bengaluru police, which received around 20 calls per day. “Our aim is to make the process of lodging a complaint people friendly. Such system is being introduced for the time in the country,” said the police commissioner. Explaining how the new system works, deputy commissioner of police, command centre, Isha Pant said a victim of online financial fraud has to call 112 and raise a complaint, giving available details. “This is registered as a Cybercrime Incident Report (CIR). This is not a First Information Report (FIR) but a CIR. The details are then given to cybercrime investigators, a team dedicated to this process, operating out of the police command centre. They network with banks and RBI and freeze accounts following an investigation,” she said. She added that the cybercrime investigators have received training in handling such cases and they would make use of the mobile number from which the victim got a call or the details of the bank to which to money was transferred. “RBI already has a Standard Operating Procedure for such frauds or the project. As per that, it is very important that the complaint is lodged within 2 hours of the fraud. RBI calls this the golden hour because it is the time available before this money is transferred or withdrawn,” the officer added. A CIR is not an official complaint. In case the money is retrieved by the police, in order to get it back, the victim should lodge an FIR. “The FIR is an official complaint. CIR is part of the process to fast track the investigation. Once the money is retrieved, it can be given to the victim through a court order,” Pant added. So far, Bengaluru Police have five dedicated lines for cybercrimes and 20 cybercrime investigators working in three shifts, which is expected to be expanded over the coming months, said an officer. In 2019, Bengaluru recorded the maximum 10,668 cybercrime cases, followed by Mumbai with 1,482, Lucknow (962), Hyderabad (428) and Jaipur (415). In Bengaluru, the number of cases showed a 91.51% increase in a year from 2,743 in 2017 to 5,253 in 2018, as per NCRB data.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/police-launches-helpline-to-curb-online-fraud-101618600636261.html
17-04-2021||India||Amid sharp surge in Covid-19 cases, Yediyurappa tests positive||Bengaluru Around eight months after he recovered from Covid-19 in August last year, Karnataka chief minister BS Yediyurappa once again tested positive for the infection on Friday.The infection was first detected through a Rapid Antigen Test (RAT), few hours after the CM held an emergency meeting with senior ministers and officials to discuss the strategy to contain the surge of the pandemic in the state. It was later confirmed by an RT-PCR test.The development comes two days after the CM campaigned in Belagavi for bypolls, raising concerns about the number of people he might have come in contact with during his rallies.Video clips of the rallies seen by Hindustan Times showed Yediyurappa surrounded by hundreds of people in Belagavi, one of the three constituencies that go to bypolls on Saturday.“Upon having mild fever, today I got tested for Covid-19 and my report has come out positive. Although I am doing fine, I am being hospitalised based on the advice of doctors. I request all those who have come in my contact recently to be observant and exercise self-quarantine,” Yediyurappa posted from his personal Twitter handle.The CM has been admitted to Manipal Hospital, a private medical facility in Bengaluru, which treated him the last time he contracted the disease as well.Meanwhile, the active case count in Karnataka breached the six-figure mark on Friday and stood at 107315 after the state reported 14,859 new infections, according to the daily health bulletin.The state also reported 78 fatalities while the case positivity rate was recorded at 11.11%, according to government data.Yediyurappa, 78, had earlier got tested on April 13 after experiencing symptoms but was ruled Covid negative following which he left for the border district of Belagavi for campaigning for two days, according to the chief minister’s office.However, on both days (April 13 and 14) Yediyurappa called off his campaign mid-way and returned to his hotel room after feeling uneasy, people in the know of the matter said. He returned to Bengaluru on Thursday and after taking a day’s rest called for an emergency meeting on Friday morning. At around 11am, he addressed the media as well. A couple of hours later, he was declared Covid-19 positive. “A medical board of clinical experts has been instituted and currently he is being evaluated and treated for respiratory symptoms. He is cheerful and clinically in a stable condition,” according to a statement by Manipal Hospital.“Primary contacts such as important leaders who have come in contact with the CM during campaigning will be tested for Covid-19,” Dr CN Manjunath, member of Karnataka’s technical advisory committee on Covid-19, said, adding that those who attended Yediyurappa’s rallies but kept their distance from him were “not at risk”.“Contact tracing becomes very difficult when you cannot identify or locate people who have come in contact (with a patient). This happens in the case of crowds. However, all those who could be identified should be subjected to an RT-PCR test,” said a senior government official, requesting not to be named.Karnataka is witnessing a sharp surge in cases lately leading to overburdening of the health infrastructure. Capital Bengaluru, the worst hit in the state, reported 9,917 new cases and 57 fatalities on Friday. The figure is much higher than the last record high of 5,121 cases reported on October 8, 2020. Experts said the jump was an indication of the rapid transmissibility of the virus in the second wave of infections.The situation in other parts of the state too continued to deteriorate, data showed.There were 279 new infections in Ballari, 120 in Belagavi, 358 in Bengaluru Rural, 326 in Bidar, 180 in Chikballapur, 256 in Dakshina Kannada, 176 in Dharwad, 244 in Hassan, 488 in Kalaburagi, 158 in Koppal, 137 in Mandya, 432 in Tumakuru and 207 in Vijayapura on Friday.The government has imposed a night curfew in about seven district of the state, including Bengaluru.Yediyurappa on Friday said the state government will take a fresh decision on further curbs before April 20 after meeting with members of the opposition and consulting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi.He, though, indicated that the night curfew was likely to be extended and imposed on a few other districts as well.K Sudhakar, Karnataka’s health and family welfare, and medical education minister, said the number of people allowed to participate in gatherings in open and enclosed spaces will be drastically cut down. While only 200 people will now be allowed to attend events in the open (as opposed to 500 earlier), only 100 people will be permitted to gather in enclosed spaces, he said. For funerals, only 25 to 50 people will be allowed at a cremation ground while no more than 25 people will be allowed at cemeteries for burials, according to the government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amid-sharp-surge-in-covid-19-cases-yediyurappa-tests-positive-101618600576274.html
17-04-2021||India||Amid Covid-19, EC bars campaigns at night||The Election Commission of India on Friday banned campaigning from 7pm to 10am and extended the silence period for the upcoming three phases of the West Bengal election to 72 hours, warning candidates and political parties of strict action for violations as Covid-19 cases spike across the country.The commission directed political parties and candidates to provide masks and sanitisers to participants at public rallies and meetings, threatening strict action, including penal provisions, over non-compliance.“Candidates and parties shall ensure absolute, repeat absolute, adherence to Covid guidelines in letter and spirit. Violations , if any shall be sternly dealt with and action, including criminal action, taken as per extant legal framework,” EC said in a letter to all political parties.“In view of unprecedented public health situation and the imperative of ongoing elections, the commission today extended the silence period up to 72 hours (instead of 48 hours) and restricted the period of campaign up to 7pm (instead of 10pm). These orders have come into effect immediately,” the commission said in a separate order.The fifth phase of the West Bengal assembly election will be held on April 17. Political parties such as the Trinamool Congress had demanded that the remaining three phases of the poll be clubbed into one, but EC officials familiar with the matter said the suggestion was not tenable and the elections would continue as scheduled. The commission also conducted an all-party meeting on Friday to address concerns of political outfits.“TMC wanted one phase,” said an EC official familiar with the matter. “BJP wanted to go as per schedule, while other parties said they would follow whatever is decided by the chief electoral officer and EC.”The official added that clubbing all three phases was procedurally and logistically not possible as the dates of issuance of notification and withdrawal were different.“The seventh and eight phases could have been clubbed together, but logistically it will be difficult to manage. Postponing the election is not a solution at all. In any case, from 26 to 29, the commission has banned campaigning.”The official said there have been no problems at the booth level, and a majority of election officials have already been vaccinated. “The officials are using sanitisers, shields and masks. The area of concern is rallies and roadshows. The local officials have been authorised to cancel any such even found in violation.”Ground reports by Hindustan Times have shown that most political parties were in violation of Covid-19 guidelines, with the candidates often following the protocol but rally participants not adhering to the norms.The EC order warned political parties of strict action in case of any violation of Covid-19 guidelines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ec-bans-campaigning-at-night-increases-silence-period-101618599858026.html
17-04-2021||India||Centre asks U.P., Chhattisgarh to increase beds, ramp up testing||The Centre on Friday advised Uttar Pradesh and Chhattisgarh to increase the number of beds for Covid-19 patients in the states as the two states continued to report a high number of cases.At a review meeting, chaired by Union home secretary Ajay Kumar Bhalla and Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan, Indian Council of Medical Research director Dr Balram Bhargava recommended ramping of testing facilities in the districts with a positivity rate of over 5%.“The reported shortage of hospital infrastructure...were discussed in comprehensive detail, requiring an urgent ramping up of hospital infrastructure. The states were advised to increase the number of isolation beds, oxygen beds, ventilators/ICU beds, ambulance fleet as per requirement; plan for adequate oxygen supply; and focus on mortality reduction by early identification of positive cases and adherence to national treatment protocol,” an official statement said.After Maharashtra, which has 638,034 active cases, Chhattisgarh and Uttar Pradesh have reported over 100,000 active cases each. On Friday, Chhattisgarh reported 14,912 fresh infections, and UP 27,360 new infections.“Health ministry is informing states every day in the morning of the day’s supply of Covid-19 vaccines, to enable better planning for optimum utilisation of the vaccines. An augmented health workforce would be needed in the coming days for contact tracing and house-to-house survey for the symptomatic patients,” the statement added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-asks-u-p-chhattisgarh-to-increase-beds-ramp-up-testing-101618598836056.html
17-04-2021||India||Institute that helped fight the 1896 plague will now produce Covid-19 jab||The institute where a vaccine was developed to inoculate Bombay’s residents against the Bubonic plague of 1896 will produce Covaxin, starting next year. A day after receiving the Centre’s nod for transfer of technology from Bharat Biotech, which developed and manufactures Covaxin, to Maharashtra government-owned Haffkine Bio Pharmaceuticals Corporation Limited, the parent organisation, Haffkine Institute for Training, Research and Testing, said it will develop a Bio-Safety Level 3 laboratory to begin production.The laboratory will come up at an estimated cost of ₹154 crore, and will be equipped to produce 228 million doses annually of Covaxin, Dr Sandeep Rathod, managing director, Haffkine Institute said.“The manufacturing of the vaccine will be done in two phases — first, we will manufacture the raw material which we call the drug substance, and second, fill and finish of the product. We will manufacture the drug substance at our BSL -3 laboratory (which will be set up), and as part of the next step, the vaccine will be filled in bottles and the product will be finished. We are looking to start production in a year,” he said.A BSL-3 laboratory usually takes years to set up, but Rathod said the institute will aim to set one up within a year. The work undertaken in such a laboratory involves high-risk microbes that can cause potentially lethal diseases through respiratory transmission, and thus follows stringent containment protocols.For instance, the exhaust air from the laboratory cannot be recirculated, and the premises must have sustained directional airflow by drawing air from clean areas towards potentially contaminated areas.On Thursday, Renu Swarup, secretary, department of biotechnology of ministry of science and technology issued permission for Haffkine Institute to produce Covaxin. In January, the institute had sought permission from Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) for transfer of technology from Bharat Biotech. ICMR and Bharat Biotech co-developed the vaccine.In March, Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray requested Prime Minister Narendra Modi to allow Haffkine Institute to manufacture the vaccine. The institute’s proposal to ICMR sought funds from the state and Centre.Dr Waldemar Mordecai Haffkine was deputed to then-Bombay to help authorities tackle the Bubonic plague outbreak in 1896. Haffkine started the Plague Research Laboratory and developed a vaccine that he first tested on himself and his assistant in January 1897. The vaccine was then rolled out to inmates of a Byculla prison – all of whom survived the epidemic and did not contract the plague.The vaccine was then rolled out among the Parsis, one of the first communities that agreed to be vaccinated en masse. The microbiologist is also credited for having developed an anti-cholera vaccine. The laboratory, which was shifted to the Governor’s official residence in Parel in 1899 – a site it has occupied since then – was renamed Haffkine Institute in 1925.The multidisciplinary institute is engaged in training, research and testing of various aspects of infectious diseases. It is credited with developing a number of prophylactics in the recent past too, including the anti-rabies serum, anti-venom serum, and oral polio vaccine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/institute-that-helped-fight-the-1896-plague-will-now-produce-covid-jab-101618598776716.html
17-04-2021||India||Top akhadas call for Mahakumbh to end||For the first time in the history of the Mahakumbh, akhadas, the all-powerful spiritual sects to which seers belong, have given a call for ending Mahakumbh midway after several seers tested positive for Covid-19 and two chief seers, or Mahamandaleshwar, died from the viral disease. Mahakumbh, which started on April 1, is scheduled to end on April 30.On Friday, Haridwar reported 539 of 2402 fresh cases in Uttarakhand, and 28 seers from three akhadas tested positive for Covid-19, according to officials. Of the 28, 22 are from Niranjani Akhada, four from Maha Nirvani Akhada and two from Juna Akhada, said Kumbh Mela health officer Dr AS Sengar, adding that testing at akhada camps has been increased.Around 75 seers have tested positive over the last two months, said chief medical officer, Haridwar, Dr SK Jha.Seers fear they might get infected with the virus in the Kumbh area, which witnessed a rush of over 1.3 million on the Shahi Snan (holy dip in the Ganga) on Wednesday. Still, the call of some akhadas for an early end to the Mahakumbh has not been backed by the apex Akhada Parishad.The call was given by Shri Panchayati Niranjani Akhada, and been supported by Shri Panchayati Atal Akhada, and Shri Anand Akhada, whose seers have actually started leaving the Kumbh area. The largest Akhada, Shri Panch Dashnam Juna Akhada, has also expressed serious concern over the spike in Covid cases and its impact on the rest of the Kumbh, although it has not sought a shortening. Across akhada camps, though, fear-stricken seers are lining up to be tested.On Friday, Mahamandleshwar Jagatguru Swami Shyamdev Devacharya Maharaj, who held the seat of mahant at Jabalpur’s Narsinmgh Temple Gita Dham, died due to Covid-19.Earlier, on April 13, Mahamandaleshwar of Shri Panch Nirmani Ani Akhada, Kapil Dev Das, died of the infection. Many from his akhada have since returned to their base in Madhya Pradesh’s Chitrakoot.With just one Shahi Snan left on April 27, the secretary of the second largest akhada, Shri Panchayati Niranjani Akhada, Shri Mahant Ravindra Puri Maharaj, who tested positive on Thursday, has urged seers to leave the Kumbh area. “Some akhadas taking part in the Chaitra Poornima Shahi Snan on April 27 should take a symbolic dip and not resort to a grand public religious procession.”Shri Anand Akhada’s Mahamandaleshwar Swami Balkanand Giri has also announced that his akhada will leave the area, although, three of its seers will stay back for the Shahi Snan.The three Bairagi Akhadas, who are followers of Vaishnavism, however, have made it clear that they will go ahead with the April 27 Shahi Snan. They criticised the Niranjani-Atal Akhada and the Anand Akhada for their call and sought an apology from them for “giving a wrong and negative message of ending Mahakumbh midway”.Shri Mahant Dharam Das of Shri Nirvani Ani Akhada said, “It is only the Uttarakhand government that has the right to end the Kumbh fair.”Shri Panchayati Bada Udasin Akhada has made it clear that its seers will take part in the Shahi Snan irrespective of the call by some akhadas. “But we are not averse to restricting the number of seers in the Shahi Snan,” said its Mahamandaleshwar, Hari Chetnanand Maharaj .The Akhil Bharatiya Akhada Parishad, the apex body of all the 13 akhadas, clarified that Mahakumbh has not come to an end and Shahi Snan on April 27 will go ahead as per the tradition.“Those akhadas who have announced Mahakumbh ending are those who don’t take part in the last Shahi Snan. It is a welcome step as they have asked their akhada seers to leave the Kumbh camp...,” said Akhada Parishad general secretary Mahant Hari Giri Maharaj.Writer Mahesh Parikh, who has been tracking akhadas for years, pointed that as per tradition, the last Shahi Snan of Chaitra Poornima is attended only by three Bairagi Akhadas. Most others do leave sometime after their own holy dips are over, although this time, the fear of Covid has expedited the process, he added.As Bairagi Akhadas worship Lord Ram, its seers will also be taking part in the holy bath on Ram Navami on April 21.Kumbh Mela officer in charge Deepak Rawat said Mela administration has not received any directive regarding curtailing or ending the Mahakumbh before April 30.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/top-akhadas-call-for-mahakumbh-to-end-101618598776131.html
17-04-2021||India||Infra overrun: Scramble for ventilators, oxygen, ICU beds||A record daily spike in coronavirus infections pushed health infrastructure to the brink in several states on Friday as patients scrambled to secure hospital beds, governments struggled to provide oxygen needed to stabilise serious patients, and crematoriums in major cities reported huge rush and long delays.The worst crisis was reported from major urban centres with high caseloads, bringing true fears, expressed by experts when the pandemic first hit India in March last year, of infections inundating hospitals, overwhelming civic infrastructure and taking medical staff to the breaking point.In Delhi, which reported its highest daily case number of 19,486 on Friday, 88% of 3,976 intensive care unit beds were occupied, according to the government’s Delhi Corona app. Patients also reported acute difficulties in securing a bed.In Bengaluru, which logged 9,917 cases, 99% beds in government hospitals were occupied, an increase of more than 20 percentage points in the past three days. In Mumbai, which saw 8,839 cases, the bed occupancy rate was close to 80%. The availability of beds in ICUs or with oxygen support was even harder to come by. What made matters worse for critical patients in several big cities was that the distribution of vacant beds was uneven and poorly publicised, and getting care in hospitals in the vicinity was difficult.“We do not have beds, what can we do. We have to refuse patients. We do not even know where to refer them to; it is not like there are hospitals in the city that have beds available,” said a doctor from a top private hospital in Delhi. The situation was no better in smaller cities.In Chhattisgarh’s Raipur, the occupancy rate of beds increased to 90% on Friday even as the state announced new Covid care centres for mild or asymptomatic patients. In Patna, all Covid beds in premier institutes such as All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Patna, and Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences were full, while those at Patna Medical College and Nalanda Medical College were up to 90% occupied, according to health department.All major hospitals in Ranchi such as Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences (RIMS) and Sadar hospital showed full occupancy of oxygen-supported and ICU beds, showed the city Covid dashboard on Friday evening.In West Bengal, which is in the middle of eight-phase assembly elections, hospital occupancy rate zoomed from 25% on February 26, when the polls were announced, to 86% on April 16, according to the state health department. During the same period, daily infections rose from 190 to 5,334, in a spike of over 2700%. Out of the 56 private hospitals in and around state capital Kolkata, 21 had no beds vacant and 22 had less than 10 beds left, showed health department data on Friday evening.“The occupancy rate in the government hospitals in Kolkata is much higher as the city and its adjoining district of North 24 Parganas have nearly 50% of the total cases,” said a top state health department official on condition of anonymity.Several states such as Maharashtra, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat and New Delhi, have set up Covid care centres for mildly symptomatic patients, and officials hoped these would help tide over the crisis. “We have designated 50% of all hospital beds for Covid patients,” said Chhattisgarh health minister T S Singhdeo, after videos appeared of patients on stretchers waiting outside emergency wards of hospital for admission. Some states have also placed orders for additional ICU beds.An associated problem was that of oxygen supply crunch. In many states, patients said hospitals and care centres reported a shortage of oxygen that is crucial to stabilise Covid patients whose blood oxygen levels can plunge suddenly and therefore need to be consistently monitored. States such as Jammu & Kashmir, Maharashtra, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh issued orders mandating 50% of oxygen produced by factories be provided for medical purposes. In Maharashtra’s Aurangabad, the district collector took over a local steel plant to ensure oxygen supply to hospitals in the district. On Friday, the Union home ministry directed all the states and Union territories to ensure uninterrupted movement of medical oxygen carrying vehicles along their borders, and said they must not impose any curb on production and supply of the commodity anywhere. Union home secretary Ajay Kumar Bhalla said availability of adequate and uninterrupted supply of medical oxygen is an important prerequisite for managing moderate and severe cases of Covid-19.In Maharashtra, chief secretary Sitaram Kunte said the state government arranged for transportation of oxygen from neighbouring states but feared a disruption due to lockdowns in many states.Increasing Covid deaths in many of these states have also led to long delays at crematoriums. In Lucknow, workers at the city’s three biggest crematoriums said they were working round-the-clock, leading to a shortage of wood. In Ahmedabad, crematoriums reported a waiting time of anywhere between five to 12 hours.In Raipur, the district administration created 14 makeshift cremation grounds while in Surat, the authorities reopened a crematorium after 15 years and created another makeshift one.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-surge-pushes-health-civic-infra-to-breaking-point-101618598716178.html
17-04-2021||India||1,189 samples have tested positive for SARS COV-2 variants: Health ministry||A total of 1,189 samples have so far tested positive for variants of concern of SARS COV-2 in India, the health ministry said on Friday as the country is witnessing a steep surge in Covid-19 cases.These include 1,109 samples testing positive for the UK variants, 79 for the South Africa variant and one sample for the Brazil variant, the ministry said.Till April 15, 13,614 samples have been processed at the 10 designated INSACOG laboratories for whole genome sequencing (WGS), it added."Of these, 1,189 samples have tested positive for variants of concern for SARS COV-2 in India. This includes 1,109 samples with the UK variants; 79 samples with the South Africa variant and one sample with the Brazil variant," the ministry said.The coronavirus has been mutating and various mutations have been found in several countries, including the UK (17 mutations), Brazil (17 mutations) and South Africa (12 mutations)."These variants have a higher transmissibility. The UK variant has been found extensively in the UK, all across Europe and has spread to Asia and America."The double mutation (two mutations) is another variant and has been found in several countries like Australia, Belgium, Germany, Ireland, Namibia, New Zealand, Singapore, the United Kingdom, the USA. Higher transmissibility of this variant is not established as yet," the ministry said in a statement.It said the RT-PCR tests being conducted in India do not miss these mutations as these tests target more than two genes. The sensitivity and specificity of the RT-PCR tests remain the same as earlier, it said."The detection of these mutations does not change the strategy of management which remains to test, track, trace and treat. The use of masks remains as the most important shield to prevent the spread of COVID-19," the ministry stressed.It said the INSACOG guidelines were shared with the states again and they were advised to send samples for genome sequencing by also providing the clinical data of positive persons.This will enable a great epidemiological insight into the link of the surge at various places to the variants as well as enable the INSACOG to discover other variants of concern, if present in the community.Many states, including Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Kerala, are yet to share the data with the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), though Punjab and Delhi have shared the information, the ministry highlighted.The Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genomics Consortium (INSACOG) is a network of 10 laboratories established in December 2020 for continuously monitoring the genomic changes of SARS-CoV-2 in the country through WGS.The SOPs for epidemiological surveillance and response in the context of a new variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus detected in the UK were disseminated to all the states as well as placed on the ministry's website on December 22, 2020.According to the INSACOG guidelines, positive samples are sourced for WGS from international travellers who are positive by RT-PCR, community samples are coordinated by the state surveillance officers, who facilitate the transfer of samples from the districts or laboratories to the designated INSACOG laboratories. All states have been mapped to specific INSACOG laboratories.The 10 identified INSACOG laboratories report their sequencing results to the Central Surveillance Unit (CSU) of the NCDC, from where it is shared with the state surveillance units (SSUs) of the IDSP through email as well as regular meetings by the NCDC with the state surveillance officers, who, in turn, take up the operational response with the health secretaries.Hence, the states are continuously informed of the virus variants found in other states, the ministry said.In a few instances, the INSACOG laboratories have also communicated the results directly to the states.The NCDC has also communicated state-specific results formally to the states concerned from time to time. The results of Himachal Pradesh were communicated on April 8, those of Punjab were communicated on March 26, those of Rajasthan on April 10 and those of Maharashtra were shared with the state on nine different occasions from March 12 to April 16.Written communications on the need for more stringent measures were sent at regular intervals not just to the high-burden states, but all the states by the secretary (health), assistant secretary (health), NCDC director and IDSP to the chief secretaries, ACS health, SSOs, DHSs etc.The states and Union territories were repeatedly asked to keep a strict vigil and take up stringent public health measures in view of the unlock provisions and new strains being reported from various countries.Press briefings conducted by the health ministry provide specific updates on the current status of the variants of concern and the new mutants, and also stress on increased and stringent public health interventions.At a press briefing on March 24, the NCDC director made a detailed presentation on various variants of the coronavirus detected in the country, the ministry said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/1189-samples-have-tested-positive-for-sars-cov-2-variants-health-ministry-101618597656073.html
17-04-2021||India||India reiterates call for immediate ceasefire in Afghanistan||India on Friday called for an immediate ceasefire in Afghanistan to end a wave of violence and targeted killings, and said it is closely following the intra-Afghan peace process in the wake of the US decision to withdraw all its troops from the war-torn country. Following US President Joe Biden’s announcement about withdrawing all American forces by the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks in September, secretary of state Antony Blinken visited Kabul on Thursday to discuss the transition with the Afghan leadership. Blinken also conveyed the US commitment to a continuing partnership with Afghanistan. Reacting to these developments, external affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said: “We have noted the decision of the US to withdraw its troops from Afghanistan and to end its military operations there. We are closely following the ongoing intra-Afghan peace process.” Bagchi added, “We are deeply concerned about the increase in violence and targeted killings in Afghanistan. India has called for an immediate and comprehensive ceasefire.” The Afghan people, he said, have seen more than four decades of war and unrest and deserve long-lasting peace and development. “India is of the view that an Afghan peace process should be Afghan-led, Afghan-owned and Afghan-controlled. Any political settlement must be inclusive and should preserve the socio-economic and political gains of the past 19 years,” he said. India backs a united, democratic and sovereign Afghanistan and has participated in several key meetings aimed at helping chart a way forward in Afghanistan, including the Doha Conference, the Geneva Conference and the Heart of Asia Conference in Dushanbe. “India remains engaged with the Afghan stakeholders and also our regional and international partners regarding next steps,” Bagchi said. After his talks in Kabul, Blinken told reporters that there is no military solution to the conflict in Afghanistan, and the only way toward a durable and lasting end to the war is through negotiations and a political agreement based on compromise. “And I hope the Taliban understands that as well. If as our forces are withdrawing, the Taliban were to attack them, it would be met with a very forceful response. And of course, as I said, we’re going to continue to support the Afghan National Security Forces, but importantly we are doing everything we can now to advance diplomacy, to bring in regional and international partners so that everyone is using their influence and their leverage to advance a peaceful end to the conflict,” he said. “It’s very important that the Taliban recognise that it will never be legitimate and it will never be durable if it rejects a political process and tries to take the country by force,” Blinken said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-reiterates-call-for-immediate-ceasefire-in-afghanistan-101618597936728.html

Later, Vijayan’s principal secretary, M Sivasankar, was among those arrested for helping the accused. Investigators alleged that Suresh was the mastermind.ED moved the court saying the FIRs were filed with “ulterior motives to derail statutory investigation under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act related to the smuggling of large quantities of the gold...”The court quashed the FIRs, saying the police should have approached the special PMLA court. A single-judge bench of justice VG Arun also directed the crime branch to submit all information in the matter to the PMLA court in a sealed cover.Congress leader Ramesh Chennitahala lauded the verdict. BJP leader and Union minister V Muraleedharan said Vijayan cannot get away by sacrificing some of his officials. “He cannot intimidate central agencies.” The ruling CPI (Marxist) said the government will take a decision after examining the verdict.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gold-smuggling-case-kerala-hc-quashes-police-firs-against-ed-officials-101618560974590.html
17-04-2021||India||Ex-CBI director Sinha dies a day after testing Covid-19 positive||Former Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) director Ranjit Sinha (68) passed away in Delhi on Friday, a day after he tested positive for Covid-19. “He showed no serious symptoms,” said a close friend of Sinha.Sinha, a 1974 batch (Bihar cadre) Indian Police Service (IPS) officer, headed the Indo-Tibetan Border Police and the Railway Protection Force before his CBI tenure. His two-year term as the CBI head from 2012 to 2014 was marred by the controversy over entries in the visitors’ diary at his official residence. The entries showed he had allegedly met suspects in the alleged 2G spectrum allocation and coal scams.The Supreme Court asked Sinha to recuse himself after details of the diary came to light. It appointed then additional director RK Dutta as in charge of the probe into the case until Sinha retired in 2014. A Delhi court in 2017 acquitted all the accused in the 2G spectrum case.The Supreme Court called the CBI a “caged parrot” during Sinha’s tenure as it came down heavily on “political masters” for interfering with the coal scam probe. In April 2017, CBI filed a case against him under the Prevention of Corruption Act for allegedly scuttling and influencing the probe in the case. There has been no development in the case since then and no charge sheet was filed.Also Read | CBI files second case against ex-TMC MP in a weekSinha was decorated with the Police Medal for Meritorious Service in 1991 and the President’s Police Medal for Distinguished Service in 1997.Serving and retired CBI officers remember Sinha as an officer who did not believe much in the hierarchy and as a very approachable person expecting colleagues to speak their mind.Anil Sinha, who worked with Ranjit Sinha and later succeeded him as CBI chief in December 2014, called the former a very affable person. “It is a sad end...

17-04-2021||India||'Double mutant' most common variant now: India's genome data||The so-called double mutation coronavirus found in Maharashtra may be becoming the most prevalent among all mutant variants in India, genome sequencing data submitted by Indian scientists to a global database indicates, according to a recent analysis that takes into account when they were detected.The analysis shows for the first time how the detection of various variants of the coronavirus may have changed.The double mutation virus – now classified as B.1.617 – was the most common in the samples sequenced in the 60 days prior to April 2 at 24%. The variant was first detected on October 5 and was relatively obscure till it began popping up on increasing number of samples January onwards, the India situation report on outbreak.info showed. On April 1, it accounted for 80% of all analysed genome sequences of mutant variants sent by India to the global repository GISAID.The second most-commonly found variant in the last 60 days was the UK variant, or B.1.1.7, at 13% of the samples, according to the assessment by scientists from Scripps Research.Both trends could be worrying for India, and, at least to some degree, explain the outbreak pattern. B.1.617 was first found in a large number of samples in Maharashtra, the first hot spot region of the second wave of infections that, till April 7, added more than half the new cases being recorded in the country.The researchers at outbreak.info added that this data may not reflect the true prevalence patterns. “SARS-CoV-2 (hCoV-19) sequencing is not a random sample of mutations. As a result, this report does not indicate the true prevalence of the mutations but rather our best estimate now.”The data may also be skewed depending on whether all genomes sequenced were uploaded, although the trends -- where B.1.617 has steadily grown in comparison to others variants among samples -- supports the overall pattern.But a top official involved in India’s coronavirus genome sequencing efforts said the findings were consistent with what has been observed by them at the ground.“Nearly 60 to 80% of the samples from Maharashtra have the variant; the prevalence must be similar in Gujarat. Elsewhere, it is under 10 to 20%. From barely existing in December, it is now found pretty much everywhere we look. We have a separate column for the variant for every state now,” said Anurag Agarwal, director, Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology, one of the ten labs under Insacog.“We have a fairly good idea about which mutated variant is prevalent where; but the important thing is all of them are increasing,” he added.“The B.1.617 variant is prevalent towards the West in Maharashtra and Gujarat. The B.1.1.7 variant is prevalent in the North in Punjab. In South India, the one with N440K mutation is prevalent but that seems to be quiet. Eventually, one of the other variants will reach there. And, in the East, we do not have a particular variant but the South African variant is fairly common in Bangladesh, causing almost 80% of the cases so that might cross over to India. That will be troublesome for the AstraZeneca vaccine.”The double mutation refers to specific changes, among some others, that are denoted by E484Q (glutamate is replaced by glutamine at the 484th spot of the spike protein) and L452R (substitution of leucine with arginine at the 452nd position).Both are being investigated for giving the virus an ability to evade immunity from a past infection, even vaccines. L452R has also been found in a variant spreading in California, US, where it was implicated in a large outbreak earlier this year. In an interview to HT on Wednesday, India’s principal scientific adviser K VijayRaghavan said B.1.617 could now be considered a “variant of concern”, or VOC.The UK variant, B.1.1.7, has been confirmed to be more transmissible and was similarly implicated in a large resurgence of cases across the UK.A second scientist involved in the sequencing efforts said more evidence is required to tie mutations with case trends. “The double mutant variant is increasing in the country. But the rise in cases cannot be attributed solely to the mutated variants. Human behaviour plays a very important part in transmission; in the UK when the new variant started spreading a lockdown controlled the spread,” said Dr Rakesh Mishra, director, Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB), one of the 10 laboratories in Insacog.Dr Saumitra Das, director of National Institute of Biomedical Genomics – Kalyani, said: “We have not been able to establish that the new variant is the reason behind the faster spread of the infection during the second wave; it is the behaviour of the people.”The analysis, published on outbreak.info, also showed that a large number of B.1.617 samples were detected in West Bengal. The 117 B.1.617 samples in Bengal accounted for 9% of the all genomes sequenced in the state till now. In Maharashtra, at 120, there were more samples but these accounted for 6% of the 1,931 samples sequenced.“To describe the prevalence of sets of mutations in our Mutation Situation Reports, we rely on shared virus sequences from the GISAID Initiative. While we apply filters to remove some low quality sequences and unreasonable metadata as described in our methods, we rely on the accuracy of the sequences and sample metadata deposited in GISAID,” the outbreak.info website said.In all, the B.1.617 variant has been found in 408 sequences sampled across the world. Of these, 265 have been found in India from among the 8,455 sequences analysed in the outbreak.info report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/double-mutant-now-most-common-of-variantsdata-101618512310963.html
17-04-2021||Today's||From 1977, a tale of a prince and a wink||At the time, I wondered if the wink was deliberate. Later, I began to question whether I’d imagined or even made it up. But when it supposedly happened, it was hard to miss. It also made me feel insufferably special!It was June or maybe July of 1977, I was graduating from Cambridge and Prince Philip was the new chancellor of the university. This was the first graduation ceremony he presided over. I was kitted out in full subfusc and mortarboard with the tassels dangling at a becomingly rakish angle. Of course, his gown was more elaborate and colourful.However, I’d been ready for a while. Along with a few chums from Pembroke, we’d already had ourselves photographed in full graduate regalia. That picture, with its cheesy smile, hangs in my study.That morning there was quite a crowd outside Senate House. The Duke was the obvious draw, but so too was the line-up to receive honorary PhDs. The two I remember were Queen Margarethe of Denmark and General Gowon of Nigeria. She was tall, stately and striking. At 37, she was a very pretty queen indeed. Beside her, Gowon cut a foolish and sorry figure. He looked far too pleased with himself. He seemed to bounce rather than walk with a silly smile plastered across his face. “Butcher of Biafra” someone in the crowd shouted as he processed past. Gowon pretended not to hear.Pembroke was among the first five colleges whose would-be graduates were asked to enter Senate House to receive their degrees. The Duke was sitting on a high-backed gilded chair at the far end of an aisle each of us had to walk down one at a time. It was a short but carefully choreographed ceremony. Each of us was required to kneel in front of the chancellor and place our hands in his. He was supposed to speak in Latin but I noticed that a proctor, who tried to look inconspicuous by the Duke’s side, took that task upon himself.When it was my turn, I got my gown entangled between my knees as I descended to rest on them. Consequently, my hands plunged into the Prince’s. He stared at me forbiddingly as I mouthed a silent apology. My face was the colour of a ripe tomato.Meanwhile, the proctor droned on in incomprehensible Latin. It didn’t last very long. A few minutes, if that. When it was over, I scrambled to my feet, mercifully without any further mistake. And that’s when it happened.As he released my hands, the Duke winked. It was very quick, no doubt, but clear and obvious nonetheless. And he kept a straight face. There wasn’t even a hint of a smile. Yet, one of his eyes had unmistakably shut and reopened whilst the other continued to look fixedly ahead.I spent the rest of the day talking about it. The Prince was the first member of any royal family I had met and at 21 that seemed to count for a lot. But what I couldn’t get over was the wink. I kept asking if he had winked at everyone else. Or did he have a problem with one of his eyes? Was it, in fact, a squint? Whatever the explanation, I felt special. Almost chosen.Around 13 years later, I was part of The Walden Interview team at London Weekend Television when Brian Walden, the host, interviewed the Prince’s daughter Anne. For security reasons, her car drove into the basement. I was one of the people waiting to receive her as she’s stepped out of the Rolls.When she learnt I was a Cambridge graduate, she asked if I was there after her father became chancellor. I needed no further prompting. My story spilt out and I told her about the wink.“Typical of him”, she snorted. That’s the closest she comes to a genial smile. “If you’d stumbled as you got up he’d have roared with laughter!”Karan Thapar is the author of Devil’s Advocate: The Untold StoryThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/from-1977-a-tale-of-a-prince-and-a-wink-101618664063052.html
17-04-2021||Today's||Saving the economy from the second wave||India imposed one of the strictest lockdowns in the world when the Covid-19 pandemic struck last year. This took a heavy toll on the economy. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) contracted by a massive 24.4% — the largest among major economies in the world — in the quarter ending June 2020. The 2020-21 GDP is expected to contract by 8%. The economy started to improve once restrictions were eased. GDP growth returned to positive territory in the quarter ending December 2020. The sequential recovery prompted claims of a V-shaped recovery in the economy. Most forecasts, institutional and private, expect the economy to grow in double digits in 2020-21 and surpass the 2019-20 GDP. All these forecasts were based on the crucial premise that India would not experience a second wave of Covid-19 infections. That assumption does not hold anymore. Not only do we have a second wave, it is more severe than the first.The economic impact is already showing. Nomura India Business Resumption Index (NIBRI) dropped to 90.4 in the week ending April 11, where 100 is the pre-pandemic value of economic activity. It reached 99.3 in February. Private forecasters are already making downward revisions to growth. A research note by Samiran Chakraborty from Citibank has already reduced 2021-22 GDP estimates by 50 basis points — one basis point is one hundredth of a percentage point — to 12%. Pranjul Bhandari from HSBC has kept her GDP projection unchanged at 11.2%, but warns of downside risks if “lockdowns intensify or spill over well into May”. The surge in new infections has resulted in states and cities imposing localised partial lockdowns, which will hurt the economic recovery that was underway. Things will only get worse if and when panic-driven migrant workers seek to return to the poor migrant-exporting states, where health and monitoring facilities are grossly under-equipped to deal with the pandemic. Reports and anecdotal accounts suggest that medical infrastructure, even in the large cities, is already strained. What should be the economic policy approach at the moment? First, it is important to underline what it cannot be. Neither a business-as-usual policy stance nor a repeat of the strategy adopted in the first lockdown is an option. Here is why. Business as usual will result in infections spreading at a faster pace across the country. Not only will this overwhelm the medical infrastructure, it can also compromise the supply chain of essential commodities including food. Agricultural production or supply of other essentials did not suffer during the first lockdown last year. This cannot be taken for granted at the moment. At a time when inflation is already on an upward trajectory, any scarcity, or even a perception of it, in essential supplies can throw things out of kilter rapidly.This means that governments, the Centre and states together, must take immediate steps to impose restrictions, including on mobility, to control the spread of the virus, even as it allows essential activities (including those critical to the economy) and movement of goods, intra- and inter-state.Any such move must learn from the experience of the last year’s lockdown. Here are two things which should be taken into consideration while deciding what is to be done. When the pandemic first erupted, nobody had any idea how long it would last and the time it would take to develop a vaccine. This created a dilemma when it came to economic support. Fiscal measures such as direct cash transfers could not have continued indefinitely. Perhaps, this was the biggest reason why the government’s response tilted more towards the liquidity/credit guarantee route rather than a fiscal push.There is reasonable clarity on these two pandemic-related questions now. First the good news — vaccines are here, and India has the wherewithal to produce them in bulk at affordable rates. The bad news is that it will take a long time to vaccinate the adult population of the country and the pandemic has the ability to keep coming back in intermittent waves, where the next wave can be bigger than the previous one.This clarity needs to be incorporated into policymaking. The economic response to the second lockdown (or whatever the necessary restrictions are called) needs to give a heavy boost to supply-side infrastructure on the health front — from testing and contact tracing to vaccine production and delivery. The quicker this can be done, the lower will be the quantity of the demand-side support (which too will be absolutely critical during the lockdown) required. Which brings us to the second issue. Who needs support, how much, and for how long? The pandemic has exposed fault lines in India’s fiscal federalism structure like never before. State governments did most of the heavy lifting during the pandemic. It is déjà vu for them as cases are surging. Unlike the Centre, which has been able to compensate for its revenue loss through routes such as increased taxes on petrol-diesel, states have taken a beating in terms of revenue. For the next few months, at least until the second wave recedes, states need to be incentivised to adopt a proactive approach in dealing with the pandemic. This can include additional grants tied to better testing and contact tracing or some sort of support for sectors which are likely to be the worst-hit by the pandemic. For instance, Bihar being offered funds in return for exhaustive testing of migrants returning in trains, or Goa being assured of critical minimum support for its hospitality industry, could help.The government could also consider targeted hand-outs to sectors worst affected by the lockdown and wage support to companies to ensure last year’s large-scale layoffs are not repeated. This need not be indefinite. The government hopes to vaccinate 300 million people (two doses) by the end of August. Even if it were to take till September, this is a substantial number which, along with non-pharmaceutical interventions, will crush the curve of infections. But for these five or six months, both companies and individuals will need help — and preferably direct fiscal help. Chanakya understands that the choice between lockdown and allowing infections to spread is not an easy one. Both hurt the economy and cause human distress. But ignoring the pandemic will not help in any way, and will only make the foundations of future recovery weak. What is needed right now is a meticulously planned surgical strike of containment and vaccinations with a clear time horizon. What is also needed is a targeted stimulus. This approach, if it has to succeed, will require a considerable amount of political capital to be invested. The health and economic crises are inextricably linked — and it is only by battling the former can there be progress on the latter. letters@hindustantimes.com||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/saving-the-economy-from-the-second-wave-101618664061464.html
17-04-2021||Today's||Protect the rights of women migrant workers||With the surge in Covid-19 across the country, there are reports, yet again, of migrant workers being left with little choice but to go back to their villages. But within this, the gender dimension has been largely overlooked. In the process of migration driven by Covid, the impact of migration on women is different from that on men.Women’s migration is not seen so much as employment-driven but as part of them relocating to places where their husbands get jobs. This is why, perhaps, they are invisible when discussing the problems that migrant workers are facing. Even though women enter the workforce in the areas they migrate to, the main reason many of them cite for migration is marriage. In the forced migration that happened last year and is re-emerging now, as in most disasters, there is an unequal gender impact.Male migration often leaves women in their villages looking after their children and extended family. This increases their burden of having to take up traditional occupations, mainly agriculture as well as care work for the elderly and children and managing the household. Many of them often don’t have the local networks, knowledge base, and ability to access many welfare schemes.The National Commission for Women had issued an advisory to the ministry of women and child development last year on measures which should be taken for the welfare of women migrants. These include, ensuring accessibility of nutritious food and drinking water; ensuring no separation from family or children where possible; and provision of sanitary napkins and special steps for the dignity and safety of lactating mothers. The advisory also spoke of protection from eviction from their residences; ensuring reponses to gender-based violence from the police and inclusive redressal mechanisms; medical care, including mental health, in migrant clusters; access to communication with their family and measures to address trauma; and access to sanitation facilities such as masks, sanitisers and soap.The response from most states to these recommendations has been slow to non-existent. Many quarantine centres and shelters for migrant women are not safe, nor are they safe on the long road home where they have neither facilities nor physical security.Many women migrants, both those still in urban areas and those who have returned home, have had to compromise on many essential requirements in their daily lives. Those in urban ghettos have been largely trapped in their rooms with their out-of-school children, unable or unwilling to venture out for fear of the virus, making them more vulnerable to anxieties and worry. With all health care workers pressed into service to battle the pandemic, many migrant women have no access to health services for other ailments.The government’s draft National Policy on Migrant Workers has largely overlooked the specific needs and concerns of migrant women. Now would be a good time to incorporate a rights-based approach in the policy with relation to migrant women. Women migrants and their vulnerabilities can be tackled only if the government addresses the structural and other challenges which cause them to be so invisible. It has to focus on women in the informal sector, especially migrant women, in its upgradation and skills programmes. The surge in Covid cases should occasion a rethink on the issue of women migrant workers and their needs, which can then be institutionalised so that they are less vulnerable during the pandemic and after.lalita.panicker@hindustantimes.comThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/protect-the-rights-of-women-migrant-workers-101618664001450.html
17-04-2021||Today's||Courts must dispel gender stereotypes||Gender sensitisation was neither a part of our school curriculum nor a part of our training when we joined the legal profession three decades ago, Though the Constitution has special provisions for women (Article 15), and, fundamental duties require citizens to renounce practices derogatory to the dignity of women, what is now recognised and addressed as misconduct or gender harassment and discrimination was an existential hazard faced by women on an everyday basis.Provisions existed in the Indian Penal Code (IPC) to curb extreme forms of harassment such as outraging modesty (Section 354) and offensive words and gestures (Section 509). Yet, the first step towards redressal of grievances of women regarding harassment in the workplace was as late as in 1997, when in Vishaka vs. State of Rajasthan, the Supreme Court (SC) issued guidelines to address the issue.Despite the Vishaka guidelines, the fact that the judicial and legislative system has a blind spot in matters of gender and is slow to change is apparent. It was only in 2013 that that legislation was finally introduced on the issue — through the Sexual Harassment of Women at the Work Place Act, 2013. It was, also, only in 2013, spurred by a public interest litigation (PIL), that SC created regulations for a gender sensitisation committee.Also Read | Study finds disproportionate ‘gender bias’ behind Facebook’s job adsGender equality, in the context of violence, came up in the December 2012 gang rape case (2017), when Justice Bhanumathi, in her concurring judgment, reminded us of the need for gender sensitisation at the school level as a mechanism to prevent sexual crime. She reiterated that honesty, pride and self-esteem are crucial to the personal freedom of a woman. The focus in the case, however, was on crimes against women with a clarion call for sensitisation of the public in matters of gender justice.Yet, in a recent case, SC, acting on a PIL by Aparna Bhat and other well-meaning citizens, has had to come down heavily on an errant decision from the Madhya Pradesh High Court (HC). As a condition for bail, the MP court asked the accused, a 26-year-old man facing charges of molesting a woman, to get a “rakhi” tied by her on the day of Raksha Bandhan. Quashing these absurd bail conditions, SC gave directions about the nature of bail conditions that can be imposed. Once again, it reiterated the requirement for sensitivity in matters of gender, and directed courts to desist from expressing stereotyped opinions. It also asked the National Judicial Academy to impart training to young judges, prosecutors, standing counsel to sensitise them to gender.While SC talks about freedom of choice and autonomy, yet the absence of sensitivity and presence of stereotyping is glaring. Casual observations and remarks promote gender biases, which, most unfortunately, have got rooted in our jurisprudence through judgments of constitutional courts. There have been enough recorded cases where not only the trial courts, but also HCs and SC have made observations about victims of rape and sexual offences — from holding that young women “conveniently fabricate the story of kidnap and rape” (State vs. Sushil Kumar, 2013) to saying that “(her) conduct during the alleged ordeal is also unlike the victim of forcible rape” (Raja vs. State of Karnataka, 2016), and to infamously propounding that “instances of women behavior are not unknown that a feeble no may mean a yes” (Mahmood Farooqui vs State (Govt. of NCT OF Delhi), 2007).Judges take an oath to uphold the Constitution and laws. Our evidence law circumscribes facts which a court can take judicial notice of. Social prejudices and retrograde social practices should never enter the realm of adjudication before any court, especially a constitutional court, as it compromises the impartiality and integrity of the justice system. This can, and does, lead to miscarriage of justice, and more significantly, the re-victimisation of complainants. Women ought to be able to rely on a justice system which is free from myths, cultural constructs and stereotypes, and on a judiciary whose impartiality is not compromised by these biased assumptions.Equality under the law is not only fundamental to access to justice but requires judicial equanimity and impartiality. Eliminating judicial stereotyping is crucial for ensuring equality and justice for victims and survivors.In 1985, the United Nations recognised the right to fair treatment of victims of crime. In India, based on the recommendations of the Malimath Committee, for the first time, the term victim was defined under the Code of Criminal Procedure. While there have been recent amendments that enable a victim to be treated fairly, the fact remains that for over 150 years, a victim was accorded the mere status of a witness at the fringes of the criminal justice system. Occasional corrective decisions of the court during this period display an individualistic approach. There is a need for a consistent judicial philosophy to correct the imbalances of the past, while ensuring that inborn prejudices and biases regarding gender are weeded out.SC has given far-reaching directions to sensitise and change the mindset of judges while deciding cases, but will these directions alone suffice? What is additionally required is a scrutiny and overhaul of the justice delivery system to ensure that courts engage in an adjudicatory process, regulated by laws; eschew biases and stereotyping; and not delve into areas which have no relevance to the decision. Addressing judicial stereotyping and strengthening the role of judiciary in dismantling stereotypes is critical in ensuring that every individual’s rights are protected, without discrimination.Sidharth Luthra is a former additional solicitor general and senior advocate, Supreme Court Ketaki Goswami is an advocate The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/courts-must-dispel-gender-stereotypes-101618575195593.html
17-04-2021||Today's||India’s health system has collapsed||“We have collapsed, Maharashtra is sinking and other states will follow.”The starkness of these words from Dr Jalil Parkar, a top pulmonologist in Mumbai’s Lilavati Hospital, silenced me in a way that little has through 2020 and 2021, when most of my journalistic energy has been spent on reporting the Covid crisis on the ground. “This is worse than World War Two,” Parkar said, lashing out in rage and hurt at how doctors and health workers are still targeted by angry and distraught families as well as armchair commentators “who sit behind their laptops and in their ivory towers”.Among other issues, Parkar’s reference was to a leaked video from his hospital which showed patients being treated in a lift-lobby packed with patients, and the simple-minded judgments that followed.He is absolutely right. There will be another day to analyse the broken health care system, the woeful underspending (less than 2% of GDP) on public health, and whether Covid has pushed us towards a new policy framework.Also Read | Plea in Supreme Court to give Covid-19 vaccine to all above 18 yearsFor now, on the ground, after tracking cremation grounds and graveyards, meeting doctors and nurses inside Covid ICUs, travelling with ambulance drivers and spending hours at testing centres, I can authenticate the fact that everything — and I mean everything — is running short.The most critical shortfall is that of oxygen. An hour from Mumbai in the Vasai-Palghar belt, eight patients died in a single day at the Vinayaka private hospital because oxygen ran out. I met the wife, son and daughter of one among them — Ram Babu, a tailor — in their tiny one-room apartment. At the centre of the room, taking pride of place, sat his sewing machine, placed on a high table, as the family sat on the cold floor, in paralysed grief.In small residential colonies, behind closed doors, are the real people behind the clinical numbers. In the city itself, at a Covid hospital in Chembur, I saw already over-stretched ward staff, going to hunt for oxygen an hour-and-a-half away, bringing it back in tiny lorries, which they would then unload and pull up, all the while in their medical scrubs. “There is at least a 50% shortage here,” said officials at the hospital.It is not just Mumbai. From Patna, I received a distraught call from a stranger, a young woman who identified herself as Manisha. Her father, just 53 years of age, was being asked by the Ford Hospital in the city, according to Manisha, to try and organise his own oxygen as supplies were just not reaching the facility.At the SRV Hospital in Mumbai, Dr Rupkatha told me that not just beds but critical drugs such as Remdesivir and Tocilizumab are entirely out of stock. “Sometimes we tell patients to reach out to dealers directly, what can we do.”Talks have begun with the military and the railways, according to Saket Tiku, the head of Indian Gas Association, on how to ferry oxygen from steel plants in the east of India to the west, where it is most critically needed. But let me translate for you in the unvarnished, chilling words of one of Maharashtra’s top Covid warriors, Dr Swaropp Hegde, what this actually means. “With not enough oxygen, we have to change our line of treatment. This will definitely mean we will see many more deaths.”The main difference between 2020 and 2021, doctors I meet on the ground in Maharashtra say, is that younger Indians are being infected, among them children as young as five and three. The mutations may mean that instead of calling this a pandemic borne from the coronavirus, we needed to start using the word “viruses” as this strain(s) is playing out in multiple different ways.Meanwhile, at crematoriums and graveyards, space runs short and the heart stops. In Ghatkopar, I meet a 95-year-old man in a wheelchair waiting to bid farewell to his wife. Another man, younger, angrier, shouts out. “First there was no space in hospitals, now there is no place at the shamshan ghat… Where should we go?”India’s health system has cracked under the weight of Covid. We are in a national emergency. The images of the election rallies, the religious congregations, the farmers protests — any mass congregation — is not just idiotic, it is an insult to the doctors at the frontline who say they are “exhausted and worn out”.More than 800 doctors have already lost their lives to Covid. We claim to respect them and salute them every day. And yet, our utter callousness and the bizarre mixed messaging from our politicians — lockdowns for citizens, rallies for netas — are a criminal affront to every health worker on duty.As Hemant Deshmukh, dean at Mumbai’s KEM Hospital told me, “Right now, we are discussing shortage of beds and drugs and vaccines. What if we run short of doctors?”Barkha Dutt is an award-winning journalist and authorThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/indias-health-system-has-collapsed-101618558934636.html
