According to MCG officials, Hero Motorcorp Limited will maintain and beautify the Aravalli Biodiversity Park for a period of 10 years and spend ₹1.25 crore annually for maintaining the park under its corporate social responsibility (CSR) funding. Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar also attended the meeting via videoconference, said MCG officials.The MoU was signed by MCG commissioner Vinay Pratap Singh and representatives of the motorcycle and scooter manufacturing company at the PWD Rest House in Civil Lines. “This is an excellent example of a public and private partnership which will not only support the ecological restoration of the vast park, protect its existing wildlife and forest reserves also but continue to be a source of providing fresh air to the city and help check localised air pollution,” said Singh.The Aravalli Biodiversity Park is spread across 390 acres and has semi-arid vegetation, with around 300 native plants, 101,000 trees, 43,000 shrubs, and 185 different types of birds. IAmGurgaon, a non-governmental organisation (NGO), was looking after the maintenance of the Aravalli Biodiversity Park from 2014 till December last year until its contract with the MCG expired. The MCG’s horticulture wing was maintaining the park in the interim. The park was opened on June 5, 2010, on World Environment Day. Before it became a full-fledged urban forest, it was an abandoned mining site. In November 2002, the Supreme Court banned all mining activities in the Aravalli mountains, a month after which the Haryana government had also issued a similar order. “Proper maintenance of the park is essential as the park is the city’s main source of clean air. The MCG should now shift its focus on ensuring it is no longer used as a venue for hosting cultural festivals and also deal with encroachment on the outskirts of the park, especially near Nathupur, where cases of tree felling, rampant construction, and illegal borewells have been reported,” said Vaishali Rana Chandra, a city-based environmentalist.“Haryana is the home of Hero MotoCorp, and we consider this our utmost responsibility and duty to preserve the natural ecosystem and the habitat within the state. We look forward to continuing working closely with the local administration and communities in making Gurugram and the state of Haryana a role model in creating a green and sustainable natural habitat,” said Dr Pawan Munjal, chairman and chief executive officer, Hero MotoCorp.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/mcg-signs-agreement-for-private-firm-to-maintain-aravalli-park-101618855353494.html
19-04-2021||Gurugram||Remdesivir black marketing a major concern in Gurugram||Having exhausted all avenues for procuring remdesivir, a broad-spectrum antiviral drug, 43-year-old Jacqueline Jindal, a city-based social entrepreneur, posted a message on social media seeking help to treat her son, who was in a critical state after testing positive for Covid-19. Within hours, she started getting calls from suspected black marketeers, who offered to arrange six vials of the drug for as high as ₹1.5 lakh.“I went to more than 20 hospitals, chemists and stockists, but there was not even a single vial of the injection available. I was in a panic as people were calling me and offering injections for high prices. Some people offered it for ₹25,000 and others for ₹40,000, while one caller from Delhi asked for ₹1.5 lakh, claiming he had picked up a major stock of injections from the manufacturer,” she said.However, Jindal did not have to revert to the callers as her appeal to the district drug controller was successful and the drug was provided at the government approved price of ₹4,000. Her son was shifted to the general ward from the intensive care unit (ICU) after five days and is reported stable.The use of remdesivir shot up due to an unprecedented surge in Covid-19 cases across the country over the last month. While hospitals are running low on remdesivir stocks, black marketeers are hoarding stocks and are making a quick buck by selling them for high prices, the police said.Another resident, Vikram Singh, who lives in a housing society on Sohna Road, said he paid ₹40,000 to procure the drug and save his mother’s life. He also was contacted on social media.Vineet Singh, a resident of Sector 57, said that he bought injections for ₹30,000 for his brother who was critical and was admitted to a hospital in Manesar. “I had posted on my Facebook page, after which four men contacted me and gave different prices. As ₹30,000 was the lowest, I requested him to deliver the injection. He called me to Rajeev Chowk, took the payment and left on a motorbike,” he said.To be sure, seven companies producing remdesivir in India have slashed prices by an average of 39%, with the costliest variant being offered by Hetero Healthcare at ₹3,490 for a 100mg vial.Even as residents rush to procure remdesivir, experts said that it is not a sure-shot treatment.Randeep Guleria, the director of All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in New Delhi, on Monday, asked doctors to exercise caution while prescribing remdesivir to patients and said that the drug is not a “magic bullet”. He said that remdesivir does not reduce mortality and is not useful to treat patients with mild symptoms.“It is important to understand that remdesivir is not a magic bullet and is not a drug that decreases mortality. We may use it due to lack of an antiviral drug and it is useless if given at an early state to asymptomatic individuals or to patients with mild symptoms. It is also ineffective if administered late,” Guleria was quoted saying by news agency ANI.How hoarders are making a quick buckKK Rao, the commissioner of police, said that people are taking advantage of the situation and minting money.In one instance on Saturday, a resident tagged the senior district officials on Twitter, complaining of illegal sales after being forced to pay ₹14,000 to purchase the same. The deputy commissioner forwarded the complaint to the drugs control officer.The complainant, requesting anonymity, offered to provide officials with the contact details of the seller, following which the officials detained them.Amandeep Chauhan, the drugs control officer for Gurugram, said, “We called the number and asked the person for remdesivir. He asked ₹25,000 for each vial. We prepared a decoy customer,” he said.Yadav said the suspect asked the decoy to reach Ardee City gate in Sector 52 and was detained on the spot upon arrival. “During questioning, he revealed two more names and said he purchased from them. They were asked to produce retail sale drugs licence or wholesale drugs licence, in compliance with Section 18(c) of the Drugs Cosmetics Act, but they did not have one. The injection recovered from their possession was for supply to the Northern Railways and not for sale. Hence, this injection was from the government supply. There is pilferage somewhere and this needs investigation,” he said.Police commissioner Rao said, “We have started an investigation and are scanning their call detail records and social media accounts to get the exact number of people contacted. Also, we will get to know who else was involved with them.”The suspects were identified as Jitender of Mathura in Uttar Pradesh, Rajkumar of Bharatpur and Kamal Kishore Singh of Pipli, in Rajasthan. They were employees of medical companies providing home isolation and medical deliveries. The police said the suspects were active on social media and respond quickly, offering the drugs at higher prices.The police officials said they have deployed informers and are expecting to make more arrests soon.Yadav said that the drug is available at hospitals and will shortly be available at chemist stores also. “Right now, our prime concern is that patients admitted should get these injections and there should be no black marketing. The stocks are ready for supply and the issue will be resolved in a day or two,” he said.However, doctors of private hospitals said that there is a shortage of remdesivir at present. “We heard that we will get the stock of injections this week and even the prices have been reduced. Earlier, there was no cap and patients even bought the injections for ₹30,000. It becomes difficult for the hospitals also to manage such situations where the patient is critical and in dire need of the injection,” said a city-based doctor, requesting anonymity.Doctors said the injection is an important component for the treatment of Covid-19 patients. “It is antiviral and it reduces viral load in the body so that it reduces further complications during high fever, which is common in Covid-19,” said Dr MK Singh, medicine specialist with W Pratiskha hospital in Sector 56.The government officials said that they are going to massively scale up the production of remdesivir injection due to the rapid surge of cases in the country. “As for remdesivir production, it had gone down but now from 26 lakh (2.6 million) vials a month, it has been scaled up to 40 lakh (4 million) vials per month while aiming for 76 lakh (7.6 million) vials each month,” Dr VK Paul, member-health, Niti Aayog posted on Twitter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/remdesivir-black-marketing-a-major-concern-in-gurugram-101618855352792.html
19-04-2021||Gurugram||Liquor store collection agent robbed of ₹6 lakh outside bank||The collection agent of a chain of liquor stores was allegedly robbed at gunpoint by four armed persons in Sector 18, near a bank, on Monday, as per a complaint filed with the police. The robbers took ₹6 lakh in the incident, the police said.The police said that one of the suspects fired two gunshots in the air to intimidate the victim, before fleeing with the money in a car. The police said the car, a Swift Dzire, was recovered from a Palam Vihar road an hour after the incident was reported. The police said that the victim was on the way to the bank after collecting cash from different outlets. The incident took place around 3.45pm, when the employee, identified as Prem, along with a driver, approached a private bank branch in Sector 18. The suspects surrounded them and tried to snatch the bag and when the agent tried to raise the alarm, they fired shots in the air before making off with the bag. The victim called the police control room immediately, following which a team was sent to the spot.Sudhir Kumar, station house officer of Sector 18 police station, said that they have registered a robbery case and crime investigation teams have been roped in to trace the suspects. “There was a rush in the liquor shops today and the sale had suddenly increased, which could have been the reason behind the robbery. The suspects were already outside the bank or there are possibilities that one of their accomplices was following the liquor shop employee and was aware of the cash transaction,” he said. The police said they are scanning CCTV footage from nearby areas to identify the suspects and the Dzire car they used in the crime.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/liquor-store-collection-agent-robbed-of-6-lakh-outside-bank-101618855352174.html
19-04-2021||Gurugram||‘Health facilities will be ramped up this week’||Deputy commissioner Yash Garg spoke to Archana Mishra about the shortfall in hospital beds for Covid-19 patients and the possible solutions being explored by the district administration.How is the district administration planning to address the Covid-19 burden on the existing healthcare infrastructure? Hospital facilities will be ramped up this week. Besides the existing 2,600 beds reserved for Covid-19 patients, we have tied up with ESIC Hospital for at least 72 beds, and the addition of over 500 beds in SGT Medical College, 150 beds in World College of Medical Sciences and Hospital, Jhajjar, and 120 beds in Medeor Hospital. These facilities will be upgraded in the next three to five days to treat moderate to severely ill Covid-19 patients. Did the administration not anticipate the load on healthcare infrastructure due to the surge in cases? Across the country, the healthcare infrastructure has been overwhelmed with rising Covid-19 cases. It is in the last seven to eight days that cases have exponentially increased in Gurugram. The spread has been too fast. Still, hospitals are in the continuous process of upgrading reserved bed capacity to accommodate patients. Strengthening a hospital infrastructure requires time. More than 91% of the active cases in the district are home isolated, but it is still difficult to find a hospital bed. Why is that? Gurugram caters to the entire Delhi-NCR, parts of Haryana and other nearby states. Since the city has some of the best hospitals, people from other cities want to be admitted (to the facilities) here. Even patients with mild symptoms, who do not require hospitalisation and can be home isolated, are also admitted to hospitals. We have requested hospitals to first consider city-based serious Covid-19 cases. But for a doctor, a patient cannot be looked at on the basis of city or state. Therefore, we are making an effort to upgrade the existing infrastructure to accommodate every serious case. You have formed 10 teams to keep a close watch on bed occupancy in big hospitals of the city. What has been the outcome so far? We were able to vacate roughly about 90 beds that were occupied by cases that did not require hospitalisation. Till Sunday, we were able to arrange beds for 200 patients as these teams have been closely monitoring hospitals’ discharge policies and bed availability. With respect to the current situation, what message would you like to convey to citizens? People should not panic and rush to hospitals if they test positive for Covid-19. Over 90% of cases can be managed at home by isolating. Visit hospitals only if it is required.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/health-facilities-will-be-ramped-up-this-week-101618855294869.html
19-04-2021||Gurugram||Residents seek more beds for Covid-19 patients||City residents are finding it hard to secure institutional treatment for their family members suffering from the coronavirus disease, with the recent spike in cases necessitating augmentation of health infrastructure in the district.During a visit to several hospitals on Monday, when the city had over 12,000 active cases, an HT team found that neither oxygen nor intensive care unit beds were available at most locations. With no luck at local hospitals, some city residents had to travel to other districts to get themselves admitted to a hospital. Paras Jain, who admitted his 20-year-old sister to a hospital in Panipat, said, “Even though my sister’s oxygen levels are stable today (Monday), on Sunday night, it seemed that the situation could go out of hand. We tried finding a bed in both Delhi and Gurugram, thinking we will get good treatment, but we were not able to secure one. Then we learnt that there was a bed available in Panipat, so we rushed and got my sister admitted after midnight.” Family members of patients said that after failing to secure beds in nearby hospitals, they resorted to setting up healthcare systems at home. Sangeeta Mahajan, a 49-year-old resident of DLF Phase-1, said, “The whole of the weekend, I tried to find a bed for myself and my husband, but we did not get any positive response. Every place was full, so we decided to set up a healthcare system at home with guidance from our doctor. Our oxygen levels are stable for now.” Vaibhav Kumar, a 17-year-old resident of DLF Phase-1, said, “For the past two days, I have been trying to find a bed in a hospital in Gurugram for a friend’s grandmother who is aged above 80 years as her oxygen level has been fluctuating constantly, but we have had no luck so far.” At four private hospitals in the city, no beds were available for Covid-19 patients as of Monday afternoon, even as more people continued to line up to get themselves tested. Arun Kumar, a symptomatic suspected patient, who was waiting to get himself tested at a private hospital, said, “I had been trying to get myself tested for two days, but either there were no slots or there was a delay in reports. Now, I have come here as I heard from a few friends that they give the report within 24 hours and a maximum of 48 hours.” The health department last week advised hospitals to admit only seriously ill patients. The district administration has also launched a portal — covidggn.com/public/pages/gurugram-hospitals — where people can track bed availability in real time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/residents-seek-more-beds-for-covid-19-patients-101618855294231.html
19-04-2021||Gurugram||Rush at liquor stores as Delhi lockdown sparks fears||Soon after the Delhi government announced a six-day lockdown, liquor shops in the city were flooded with buyers on Monday, much like the scene in the Capital. While many from Delhi who work in the city lined up to stock up on liquor for the lockdown, city residents also started gathering at these stores fearing the possibility of a lockdown due to the rise in Covid-19 cases over the last month.However, learning from past experiences, the police deployed more than 1,000 personnel at liquor vends across the district on Monday. Ankit Kumar, a resident of Vasant Vihar in Delhi, said he worked in Udyog Vihar and as soon the lockdown was announced, his friends started calling him informing him about the long queues in the Capital. “They asked me to buy liquor for them as well and I received more than 20 messages from different people, who sent money through e-wallets to ensure I didn’t miss their demands,” he said. Another Delhi resident, Shveta Tiwari, of Mayapuri, who works in an office on Golf Course Road, said that she received more than 30 calls to buy liquor before leaving for home. “My friends had bought booze mostly by paying double the price last year. So, this time, everyone wanted to be safe and wise,” she said. Police commissioner KK Rao said that they asked liquor shops to ensure no one was allowed to enter without face masks and to ensure social distancing. “As the cases are rising, we want to take all possible precautions to ensure the safety of people,” he said. Shopkeepers said people bought liquor in bulk on Monday. “We were shocked when people suddenly started coming and asking for cases of Scotch, whiskey and beer. Generally, people buy beer from Delhi as it’s cheaper there but due to the sudden lockdown and no stock of beer, people are buying from Gurugram,” said Rakesh Kumar, a salesman at a liquor shop on MG Road. VK Beniwal, the deputy excise and taxation commissioner (east), however, said that they did not receive any information related to rush at liquor shops. “We have all arrangements in place and excise teams are keeping a close watch on all precautionary measures at liquor shops,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/rush-at-liquor-stores-as-delhi-lockdown-sparks-fears-101618855293604.html
19-04-2021||Gurugram||Over 2,000 positive patients remain untraceable||At least 2,139 Covid-19 patients of the 12,000-odd active cases in the district remain untraceable, with their mobile phone numbers and addresses turning out to be incorrect, senior government officials involved in Covid-19 duties said.“Out of the 12,000 active Covid-19 cases, nearly 2,139 are yet to be traced due to wrong contact details. It takes almost four to five days to track such cases, with the help of the police department,” said a senior official privy to the matter. Even during a review meeting held with the state-appointed nodal officer for Covid-19, TC Gupta, additional chief secretary, mines and geology, employment, and housing, the details were shared by Jaspreet Kaur, additional commissioner, Municipal Corporation of Gurugram, who has designated with the task of handling testing and confirmation of positive cases. In a statement issued by the district administration, Kaur said that in the past week, details of 3,300 people have been shared with the police department, of which 1,200 positives were tracked. The list of positive cases prepared by the MCG’s health team is provided to different urban primary health centres to trace and isolate cases. In some cases, due to incorrect contact details and no response through telephonic calls, positive cases go untraceable. Usha Kundu, an assistant commissioner of police, who was also present at the meeting, said five teams were deployed for each zone to identify such patients. With the administration conducting almost 10,000 tests every day, the district has been reporting more than 2,000 cases every day. On Monday, at least 1,809 new Covid-19 cases were confirmed, taking the active case count to 12, 772, of whom 11,965 are in home isolation, over 144 at Covid care facilities and at least 663 in different hospitals. Five people succumbed to the illness on the day, taking the death count to 383. The last time the district reported five deaths was last year, on December 2.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/over-2-000-positive-patients-remain-untraceable-101618855292911.html
19-04-2021||Gurugram||1,809 new cases, 800 beds to be added||The district administration on Monday decided to add 800 additional beds with oxygen support within five days through tie-ups with private medical colleges as the city continues to struggle with a stressed healthcare system in the absence of adequate government facilities. On Monday, 1,809 new cases were reported, compounding the situation.“The state and district administration is handling the bed management on a war scale now. The plan is to make all 800 beds available to people by April 22 evening. Every day, bed capacity will be strengthened to ensure moderate to severely ill Covid-19 patients do not face difficulties in getting beds for treatment,” said TC Gupta, additional chief secretary, mines and geology, employment, and housing, who has been appointed as the Covid-19 officer for Gurugram by the Haryana government. Currently, almost 2,600 reserved beds for Covid-19 cases have been occupied. As per the data available on the government website, only 128 of 1,873 oxygen beds are vacant across 41 hospitals. Likewise, only nine ICU beds of 527 and three ventilator beds of 237 are available. According to the health department, more than 50% of beds are occupied by patients from across Delhi-NCR, other parts of Haryana and neighbouring states. Going by the district health bulletin on Monday, as many as 663 patients from Gurugram are undergoing treatment in various private hospitals. Providing adequate beds for timely treatment has become critical as the district on Monday reported five Covid-19 deaths within 24 hours, taking the toll to 383. To tackle the situation, Gupta held a meeting with senior officials of government departments that have been allotted Covid-19 duties, such as bed management, testing, tracking home-isolated patients and ambulance fleet management. In the meeting, Gupta announced that 800 beds would be added.Of the 800, 500 will be added at SGT Medical College in Chandu Budhera, at least 150 beds in World College of Medical Sciences Research and Hospital, Jhajjar, and at least 56 in Medeor Hospital, which is the Covid-19 designated facility for seriously ill patients. At present, the Medeor Hospital has 64 occupants, which is the current maximum capacity.“There are only limited beds, nearly 95, in government facilities which include Civil Hospital and ESIC Hospital. By tying up with medical colleges, the government Covid-19 bed capacity will dramatically increase in the state to cater to people who cannot afford private hospitals or lack health insurance. It is being ensured that these facilities are provided with enough medical supplies, oxygen support and health staff to handle patients,” said Gupta. Medeor Hospital, the designated Covid-19 facility, has also been provided with at least 60 paramedic staff, who will be joining this week, by the state administration. “The hospital has also been asked to submit its current requirement of doctors. The state has agreed to provide adequate staff,” said Gupta. Dr Sanjay Gupta, head, internal medicine and medical superintendent, Medeor Hospital, said, “All 64 beds are occupied. A lot of people have been approaching us, almost double our capacity, to get admitted. These are moderate to severely ill patients who need immediate hospitalisation. The facility will add more beds in the next 48 hours as we have asked the administration to provide us with adequate staff.” Due to the fast occupancy of beds, the additional chief secretary also stressed updating real time data regarding availability on the government portal (covidggn.com). The portal shows the number of vacant oxygen, ICU and ventilator beds at private and government hospitals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/1809-new-cases-800-beds-to-be-added-101618855292264.html

19-04-2021||Bangalore||Karnataka govt to announce strict Covid-19 measures on Tuesday||Karnataka government would announce strict Covid-19 containment measures in the State on Tuesday after Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa's meeting with the Governor Vajubhai Vala and leaders of political parties.There are indications that there may not be a complete lockdown with opposition to it from within the government and also from the opposition parties."Legislators and leaders suggested to not go into lockdown as it will affect the poor. The Chief Minister, undergoing treatment (for Covid-19) at a hospital, participated in the meeting today and took note of the suggestions," Revenue Minister R Ashoka said.After meeting with MLAs, MPs and Ministers from Bengaluru on the Covid-19 spike in the city, he told reporters that the Chief Minister would have a virtual discussion with the Governor and opposition parties on Tuesday after which he would announce the Covid-19 control measures."The next two months are crucial to manage things during this period and to take certain stringent steps, meetings are being held with leaders of all parties today and tomorrow," he said.The Governor would preside over a virtual meeting with floor leaders of both Houses of the State Legislature on April 20 to discuss the Covid-19 situation.Meanwhile, a copy of guidelines imposing State-wide night curfew was circulated in the social media and whatsapp groups, but the Chief Minister's office said no such guidelines were issued.The corona curfew between 10 PM and 5 AM, currently in place in seven district centres, along with Manipal, comes to an end on Tuesday.The Revenue Minister said while some legislators were in favour of extending night curfew, some opposed it. But no one spoke about the weekend lockdown, he said.Senior Congress legislator and former Minister Ramalinga Reddy hit out at the government for not taking adequate measures or preparations for the second wave of the virus."There are no answers to the questions posed to the government. To cover up their failures, they have symbolically called us for a meeting. If you (govt) impose lockdown, give ₹25,000 for every family as was sought by us," he said.Another senior Congress MLA Krishna Byre Gowda said, "At the meeting, we asked as to why precautionary measures were not taken during the last two months despite the threats of a second wave looming large. It looked like they had called the meeting to escape from its responsibility," he said.Giving details of the meeting, Ashoka claimed MLAs appreciated the measures taken by the government during the first wave and sought similar measures during the second wave.Concerns over shortage of oxygen supply were expressed, he said."We have enough oxygen, but hospitals don't have capacity to store it. There is no issue with the big hospitals, but with small hospitals, yes the oxygen has to go in cylinders, so we have appointed nodal officers and have ordered for supplying cylinders three times a day to such hospitals," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/karnataka-govt-to-announce-strict-covid-19-measures-on-tuesday-101618852461692.html

19-04-2021||Dehradun||Despite HC order of 50k daily Covid-19 tests, Haridwar conducted over 21k since April 1||Despite Uttarakhand High Court’s order of 50,000 daily testings for Covid-19, Haridwar reported around 21,000 daily tests on an average since April 1 when the Mahakumbh mela started. The mega religious congregation will end on April 30. Between April 1 and April 18, a total of 3,77,555 Covid-19 tests were conducted in Uttarakhand which totals to around 20,975 tests per day on an average since the mega fair commenced earlier this year. Anoop Nautiyal, founder of Dehradun-based think tank Social Development for Communities, who has been analysing the Covid-19 pandemic, said the testing numbers in Haridwar need to be scaled up to around 50,000 as per the HC’s directions. “Haridwar has witnessed pilgrim influx in millions, including 1.3 million on Shahi Snan on April 14, at a time when the whole country is witnessing a huge surge in Covid cases. The best strategy to deal with Mahakumbh not emerging as a super-spreader is to increase the testing which is not being done. In the past 18 days, the average daily testing has been around 21,000, which is clearly not enough for a sensitive area like Mahakumbh,” he said. A day ahead of Mahakumbh, on March 31, the Uttarakhand High Court directed the state government to increase the daily Covid-19 testing from daily 5,000 to 50,000 in Haridwar to check the spread of the virus in Mahakumbh, the biggest religious congregation on the planet. The HC gave directions while hearing a bunch of PILs filed related to various issues regarding the fight against the pandemic in the state. Also, between April 1 and April 18, the number of cases in Haridwar jumped from 1,522 to 21303, while the active cases in the same period surged from 149 to 4,893. While 149 cases were reported on April 1, the number of cases reported on April 18 was 572. For the last few days, Dehradun and Haridwar are witnessing a major spike in daily cases. Between April 1 and April 18, the Haridwar district reported an increase of 19,781 cases. With Haridwar and Dehradun emerging as Covid-19 hotspots in the state, some Akhada saints have opted for symbolic bathing rituals for the rest of the Mahakumbh period and many are already leaving the Kumbh area. According to Mahant Devendra Shastri, secretary of Shri Nirmal Panchayati Akhada, around six hundred seers have left Kumbh city after the third Shahi Snan on April 14 and many will leave in the coming days. Of the 2,630 fresh cases reported by the state on Sunday, 1,281 were from Dehradun and 572 from Haridwar district. Dehradun district has reported a maximum of 41,254 Covid-19 positive cases so far followed by Haridwar (21303). Given the surge in cases, night curfew and Sunday curfew have also been imposed in Haridwar district from April 17 with district administration making it clear that curfew restrictions will be waived on festive days and Shahi Snan of April 27 in Haridwar Kumbh Mela area. On March 5, the HC constituted a committee with the mandate to inspect the preparations and status of various arrangements and infrastructural works in Mahakumbh on March 14 and submit their reports with photographic evidence. The team included district judge Haridwar, Mela Adhikari, petitioner’s counsel Shiv Bhatt and chief standing counsel. On March 24, the HC directed the state government to ensure that pilgrims coming for Mahakumbh carry negative RT-PCR test not more than 72 hours old. The development followed members of the court-appointed committee to check the situation in Mahakumbh and submit their reports.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/despite-hc-order-of-50k-daily-covid-19-tests-haridwar-conducted-over-21k-since-april-1-101618852593313.html

It stressed that non-compliance with its decision by any member will tantamount to misconduct.The advocates’ self-lockdown, however, was likely to pose difficulty in release of prisoners, including incarcerated RJD chief Lalu Prasad, who recently secured bail last week but still was not released. “We are yet to get a certified order of the high court, that granted bail to Lalu Prasad last Saturday. In the wake of the council’s decision, Prasad will now be released next week,” said Prasad’s lawyer Prabhat Kumar.The Jharkhand high court on April 17 granted bail to Prasad in the Dumka treasury case of the multi-crore fodder scam, paving way for his release from jail after three years of incarceration. The high court asked the 73-year-old leader to submit two sureties of ₹1 lakh each and a penalty of ₹10 lakh before the court below to secure his bail.Prasad was currently undergoing treatment at All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in New Delhi while in custody.Meanwhile, JSBC’s vice-chairperson Rajesh Shukla supported the council’s decision saying, “It is the lawyers who are going to incur economic losses due to complete lockdown in courts. But, we have to take this decision due to the prevailing condition. The health services are grossly unsatisfactory. Many advocates and their staff have already fallen ill. In last few days, many advocates have died due to the infection. Our priority is to save precious lives and break the chain of infection in the larger interest of public. There is no intension to harass anyone.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/state-bar-council-imposes-self-lockdown-lalu-s-release-deferred-101618851331907.html

He was speaking at the presiding officers’ virtual meeting under the chairmanship of Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla on the topic “Role of public representatives in the prevailing Covid-19 situation”. This comes barely a day after chief minister Nitish Kumar appealed to all the Bihar migrants living in other states to return as early as possible, if they so wished. Sinha said that in this hour of crisis, the respective state governments should make adequate arrangement and take care of the migrants so that they did not have the feeling of alienation. “The Bihari migrants who are in jobs or work as labourers and the students should also be provided medical facilities in the states they have been staying in,” he said. Sinha said that on the advice of Om Birla, Bihar Legislative Assembly would soon set up a control room. “I appeal to all the members of the Vidhan Sabha to set up a control room in their respective constituencies,” he said. Earlier this week, Speaker had also ordered closure of Bihar Assembly secretariat till April 25 after 44 officials and staff tested positive within three days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/states-should-take-care-of-migrants-not-press-them-to-return-bihar-speaker-101618851034482.html

CM’s appeal to migrants to return early is being viewed as a hint of tougher measures in the days to come should the current Covid-19 wave persist. “I have asked the labour enforcement offices (LEOs) to keep track of migrants’ flow at the block level. The old system of putting the migrants in the quarantine centres will be revived to check the spread in the rural areas,” the minister said. Mishra said a toll-free number has also been announced for the migrant workers to get information and help.Last year, there was a sea of humanity in the bordering towns like Nawada, Gaya, Kaimur, Banka, Gopalganj, Siwan and Champaran, as panicky migrant labourers had started pouring in through whatever mode they could from Delhi, UP, West Bengal, Haryana, Punjab, Chhatisgarh, Orisha, Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh etc. The government estimates had put their number at around 25 lakh, of which around 15 lakh returned by special trains and 10 lakh by buses and other modes. “With sources of their livelihood closing down, migrants suddenly become alien outside and want to return home. If they choose to return, it could pose challenge to the government on multiple fronts. The pandemic has aggravated the rate of unemployment and created an unprecedented situation of forced return of migrants to their native states. Now a repeat could be more difficult,” said social analyst DM Diwakar. Citing a 2020 report “Mapping Inequality in Bihar” by AN Sinha Institute of Social Studies and Oxfam India, he said that despite double digit growth, Bihar remains at the bottom in terms of development indicators, grappling with land, assets and income inequality, low productivity, limited opportunities of decent work and low demographic development with inter-state and inter-district disparities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/after-cm-s-appeal-bihar-braces-for-another-rush-of-migrants-101618851033805.html

While the oxygen supply to government hospitals has improved a bit, private hospitals continued to reel under the crisis. “The situation will ease further in a a day or two as districts where oxygen plants are situated have been asked to supply to all neighbouring districts rather than bank on the state capital,” said Kumar.In the absence of oxygen, many private hospital have put the signboard of “No Oxygen” , while others have put placards about lack of beds. Amid surging cases of Covid-19 infection, an oxygen plant was set up at Darbhanga Medical College and Hospital (DMCH) on Monday. It has a capacity to supply 45 cylinders per day.

Jaiswal, a doctor by profession, said Bihar may face situation like “Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh” if the decision was not rectified.The state government on Sunday had announced imposing night curfew from Monday from 9 pm till 5 am, besides closing malls, cinema halls, parks, schools, colleges and religious places till May 15. “Bihar government has taken many decisions which were necessary in present context. I am not an expert but fail to understand as to how night curfew will stop spread of virus. We need to enforce lockdown from Friday evenings till Monday mornings. By keeping themselves closeted in house for 62 hours, people will come to know about their disease and spread of virus will be contained,” he said and claimed to have made this suggestion at an-all party meeting convened by the Governor on Saturday.“The situation in Bihar will become like that of Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh if the strict curfew is not imposed,” he said. The Bihar Congress, on the other hand, favoured a lockdown. “At a time when the pandemic has gone out of control, night curfew, as announced by the government, would hardly prove to be of any help,” said All India Congress Committee (AICC) media panelist and MLC Prem Chandra Mishra.He said the state government should at least impose selective lockdown in the districts of high incidence, like Patna, Gaya, Aurangabad, Bhagalpur, East and West Champaran and Saran, where hundreds of Covid cases are being detected every day.State Congress chief Madan Mohan Jha, who just recovered from Covid, said the state government must enforce tough measures to contain the pandemic, besides ensuring proper medical facilities for the patients. “The lockdown shall, however, not be like the one in previous pattern, which led to deaths of many helpless people,” said Jha.(with inputs from Subhash K Pathak)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/state-bjp-chief-questions-night-curfew-cong-wants-lockdown-101618851031957.html

The number of patients cured and discharged has remained around 4,500 in the last 10 days. “Covid cases have taken a slightly worse turn. Overall, the number of positive patients has increased. Total number of people affected is very large so in that proportion patients who require oxygen support have increased. The number of patients who are on ventilators has also increased,” said Dr Dhannajay Kelkar, medical director, Deenanath Mangeshkar Hospital. “The general observation is that people are not approaching medical establishments in the early stages. When the oxygen level drops or they start feeling uneasiness then only many are going to hospitals. It could be one of the reasons why the number of people who need oxygen has increased. The patients in Covid care centres are monitored thoroughly and referred immediately to hospitals if required. Now, more people are preferring home isolation and sometimes the developing severity of the symptoms may not be noticed,” said Rajendra Muthe, deputy commissioner (vigilance), PMC. On April 1, there were 3,403 patients on oxygen support and 825 patients were critical. Whereas the active cases in Pune city were 35,849. Experts emphasised the early detection of the infection and getting treatment in the early stage of. “People might not go early to hospitals. So, pneumonia is already developed. People are still avoiding visiting hospitals because they don’t want to disturb their lives. So, once pneumonia sets patients require oxygen support. Early detection is the most effective way to prevent this stage,” said Renu Bhardwaj, microbiologist and retired professor and head of the dept of Microbiology, BJ Medical College and Sassoon. Dr HK Sale, executive director, Noble Hospital, said, “As compared to the first wave, the number of patients who require oxygen is huge in the second wave.

However, state medical minister Vishwas Sarang said there was no shortage of oxygen and the patients died due to medical complications. “An inquiry has been ordered in the matter to know the cause of the death of so many patients in one night,” Sarang told Hindustan Times on Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/officials-in-other-states-blocking-oxygen-tankers-into-mp-says-cmchouhan-101618850771293.html
19-04-2021||Other||Meerut cremation ground to expand capacity||MEERUT: Due to alarming surge of Covid-19 infection and related deaths, it has been decided to expand the capacity of the city’s main cremation ground, officials said. Six additional platforms for last rites would be added to the existing 40 platforms at Surajkund, city’s main cremation ground, officials said. They said the cremation ground managed by Ganga Motor Committee for decades was under pressure because of increasing numbers of Covid deaths. Ganga Committee’s secretary Dinesh Jain said six additional platforms for pyres would help ease the growing pressure on the ground. “Work for constructing additional platforms started on Monday morning and would be completed in a day or so,” said Jain. Jain said the present capacity of cremation ground proved to be insufficient as after last rites of a corona patient, the platform generally gets occupied for four to five days. “Serious corona patients from neighbouring districts were referred in LLRM Medical College for treatment and in case of death the last rites of people were performed at Surajkund but their relatives take time to collect their ‘asthi’ (ashes) to immerse in rivers,” he said. Jain shared that in many cases it has been seen that the entire family members get infected and hence nobody turns up to pick the remains. “Under such circumstances, platforms remain occupied for long,” he said. Jain said that he had requested municipal commissioner to issue an order to make it mandatory to pick the ashes and bones within three days of last rites being performed. The secretary said that ashes of 7 corona patients who died last year were still not collected by their family. “They are kept in the custody of cremation ground staff, but nobody has turned up in last one year to claim them,” said Jain. According to health department 15 corona patients had died in past one week in the district. However, records maintained by the cremation ground reveal that 19 Corona patients were cremated between April 12 to April 16. Cremation ground staff shared, that more than more than 30 bodies of Corona patients were brought here for cremation in past 8 days and the number of dead bodies being brought here were increasing every day. In district, 4855 people have tested positive in first 18 days of the month and maximum 741 persons were reported positive on April 18, the highest spike in a day. A day before 714 persons tested positive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/meerut-cremation-ground-to-expand-capacity-101618850011730.html

19-04-2021||Bhopal||Congress fumes as MP BJP leader flags off vehicles for carrying corpses||A controversy has erupted in Madhya Pradesh with a video purportedly showing a BJP leader flagging off six mini trucks which are meant to carry dead bodies, an incident the opposition Congress dubbed a "shameless photo-shoot".It is also alleged that one of these "shav vahans" carrying a dead body was stopped for the photoshoot.The incident occurred close on the heels of state minister Tulsiram Silawat and his supporters recently breaking coconuts and a priest chanting prayers in front of an oxygen tanker in Indore.In one of the two videos, former Bhopal mayor and BJP leader Alok Sharma was seen flagging off six "shav vahans" or vehicles to carry corpses which he handed over to different hospitals.In one video clip, Sharma is seen with the vehicles decorated with flowers.In another video, one of these vans was seen carrying a corpse with a voice telling the driver to move slowly for the video shoot. However, Sharma was not visible in this clip.Sharma has denied the allegations."I purchased these vehicles after reading reports about the shortage of 'Shav Vahans' to carry bodies. Media persons were present when I was handing over these vehicles to the management of the hospital concerned," he told PTI.He termed the allegations against him a "dirty politics by the Congress to stir a controversy"."I was receiving repeated calls for the arrangement of these vehicles. People have to wait for carrying their dead in the absence of such vehicles," the BJP leader said.Sharma said when he was handing over these vehicles to JP Hospital (the district hospital) campus, a person came to the hospital asking to arrange an ambulance to carry a corpse."I handed over the vehicle to the hospital management. Later, JP Hospital gave that vehicle to that person. The vehicle with the dead body passed from there in the presence of the media. We are making genuine attempts to make arrangements," Sharma said.On the other hand, Madhya Pradesh Congress spokesman Narendra Saluja termed the incident a "shameful act". "Earlier, BJP leaders had worshipped an oxygen tanker in Indore and halted its passage for delivery of oxygen. Now, another leader is seen flagging off Shav Vahans. In another incident, a minister inaugurated a covid care centre. They are finding 'Apada Me Avsar' for a photo shoot," Saluja said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/congress-fumes-as-mp-bjp-leader-flags-off-vehicles-for-carrying-corpses-101618847343462.html
19-04-2021||Other||Allahabad HC for weeklong closure in five cities, UP govt says no for now||Amid a surge in Covid-19 infection cases, the Allahabad high court on Monday directed the Uttar Pradesh government to strictly enforce the closure of establishments (government or private) in Prayagraj, Lucknow, Varanasi, Kanpur Nagar and Gorakhpur till April 26 except financial institutions and departments, medical and health services, industrial and scientific establishments, essential services, including municipal functions and public transport.While the court clarified that it was not imposing a complete lockdown in the entire state by its order, the UP government said there will be no “imposition of statewide lockdown or any fresh restrictions in the five cities (Lucknow, Prayagraj, Varanasi, Kanpur City, and Gorakhpur)”. The court directive and the government’s response came on a day on which Uttar Pradesh recorded 167 more deaths and 28,287 fresh Covid-19 infection cases. The state capital alone saw 22 deaths and 5,897 fresh cases.“There should be no confusion. The high court has asked us to consider. We have considered. There will be no statewide lockdown or any fresh restrictions in the five cities mentioned by the HC,” said a state government spokesperson.The spokesperson also said: “In the context of the honourable high court, we say that corona cases are rising in the state and strictness and control are necessary. The government has already taken several steps and will do so in the future. Saving lives is a priority but so is saving the livelihood of the poor. Thus, the cities will have no lockdown as of now. People themselves in a proactive manner (are) doing closures.”Additional chief secretary (information) Navneet Sehgal said, “The UP government is submitting its reply before the HC on its observations.”Earlier in the day, the bench comprising Justice Siddhartha Varma and Justice Ajit Kumar passed the order in a suo motu public interest litigation on conditions of quarantine centres in the state and the treatment of Covid-19 patients.The court further directed the state government to ensure that grocery shops and other commercial shops, excluding medicine shops, with more than three workers shall remain closed till April 26. Likewise, all malls, shopping complexes, restaurants and eateries shall remain closed till then, it said.Further, all religious places shall also remain closed for the period and no social function, except marriage, should be allowed, the court said.In case of marriage, a gathering of 25 people can be allowed with the permission of the district magistrate concerned.Vegetable and milk vendors will be allowed to sell goods on the road only till 11am and all public movement on roads will be restricted completely subject to these directions.Public movement is also permitted by the court in case of medical help and emergencies.The bench observed, “Above directions are nowhere close to a complete lockdown. We are conscious of the fact that before imposing a lockdown the concerned government has to work out various modalities. In this order if we have not imposed a lockdown, it does not mean that we do not believe in it. We are still of the view that if we want to break the chain, a lockdown for a duration of at least two weeks is a must.”“We, therefore, once again in addition to the directions we have already given, direct the government to consider imposition of a complete lockdown in the entire state for at least a period of two weeks. This would not only break the chain of the spread of the virus, but would also give respite to the health workers,” the bench added.On the increase in number of Covid-19 patients, the bench said, “The recent surge of pandemic Covid-19 has virtually incapacitated all our medical infrastructure in the state of UP and specially in cities like Prayagraj, Lucknow, Varanasi, Kanpur and Gorakhpur. It appears that the pandemic is teasing the system in a situation where patients have outnumbered the hospital beds and people are just running from pillar to post and in this process attendants of patients are not only getting infected but others in public are also getting infected and a complete chain has got formed.”During the course of the hearing, the court was informed that the state government was taking steps to increase beds for patients like three makeshift hospitals of 1000 beds at Lucknow and to increase 20 beds per day in Prayagraj.On this, court observed, “One would only laugh at us that we have enough to spend on elections and very little to spend on public health…. One cannot even imagine what will happen if only 10% of the city population gets infected and needs medical help in hospitals. How the government will manage with the presently existing infrastructure is anybody’s guess.”“Economy, economy and economy is the only tune that the government is all the time harping upon, but bread and butter if you take to a person who needs oxygen and medication, it will be of no use to him. You may have grocery shops full of eatables and industries which produce bikes and cars, but all this won’t be of any use if your medical shops run out of the stock of life saving drugs like Remdesivir in the current surge of pandemic. It is a shame that while the government knew of the magnitude of the second wave, it never planned things in advance,” the bench observed.“In any civilised society if public health system is not able to meet the challenges and people die for want of proper medication, it means there has been no proper development. Health and education go side-by-side. Those in the helm of affairs of governance are to be blamed for the present chaotic health problems and more so when there is a democracy which means a government of the people, by the people and for the people,” the court said.On the delay in providing Covid-19 test reports to patients, the bench observed, “We have been informed that people are getting developed influenza- like infections in every fifth house of every Mohalla in the city and tracking-tracing and testing system, if has not failed, has certainly not been able to meet the requirement of the population of the city. Reports are neither updated before 72 hours nor samples are taken care of, owing to the shortage of manpower. Only VVIPs are getting reports within 6-12 hours. Thus, early testing scheme or plan is a farce.”On the necessity of the lockdown, the court said, “We are of definite view that if things are not arrested to give some respite to medical and paramedical staff, the entire system would collapse and relief will be confined to VIPs and VVIPs. We find from the scenario that emerges from the government hospitals that admission of patients to ICUs are largely being done on the recommendation of VIPs. Even supply of life saving anti-viral drug namely Remdesivir is being provided only on the recommendation of VIPs. VIPs and VVIPs are getting their RT-PCR report within 12 hours, whereas ordinary citizen is kept waiting for such reports for two to three days and thus, spreading further infection to other members of his/her family.”On the panchayat election being conducted during the pandemic, the bench observed, “We must record our displeasure at the way government and the State Election Commission proceeded to hold elections forcing teachers and other government staff to perform duties exposing themselves to the threat of pandemic that looms large these days. The police was virtually shifted to polling places giving priority to election above public health.”“Further the photographs of the various places where elections were held definitely show that no social distancing was maintained. Also we find that on many occasions in various political rallies, masks were never worn by people,” the bench observed while directing the authorities to take actions against the erring organisers of political events and place the action taken report by the next date of hearing, which is fixed as April 26.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/allahabad-hc-for-weeklong-closure-in-five-cities-up-govt-says-no-for-now-101618848331853.html

Pune district, according to divisional commissioner Saurabh Rao, has a total 7.5 million people above the age of 18. “Of these 7.5 million, as many as 3.6 million come under the category of those above 45 years of age. The rest of the 3.9 million are between the age bracket of 18 and 45 years,” said Rao. The Pune district administration has already undertaken “Mission 100 days” to inoculate everyone above 18, as the city and rural areas battle a massive spike in infection. Pune district has inoculated 17,08,574 citizens, one of the highest rates in the country. The administration now hopes that in next 10 days, it will be able to vaccinate 0.55 million people, and by June 15 the entire population which has now been made eligible by the centre. Besides allowing adults to get jabs, the Centre has also allowed states to purchase 50 per cent of the vaccines directly from the manufacturer. At the same time, vaccine manufacturers will also be allowed to sell vials in the open market. “With the Centre’s decision and various stakeholders in Pune who are very aggressive, we are hoping to vaccinate all above the age of 18 even before 100 days. This will be possible with the help of the state government and local sponsors. At the same time, we will benefit with the vaccine being produced locally,” Rao added. On Monday, Pune district has 800 vaccination centres, though many were not operating at full capacity in the past few days due to a shortage of vaccines. “If everything goes as per plan, we would like to vaccinate everyone by June 15, so that even if there is a third wave, our people are reasonably protected,” said Rao. Meanwhile, the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) may stop 24x7 vaccination centres in view of the imposition of stringent curbs and the shortage of doses.

19-04-2021||Pune||Lab takes preventive steps after forgery incident||The diagnostic laboratory whose logo was misused by miscreants in forging false RT-PCR reports has now taken steps to ensure that people do not fall for frauds. Furthermore, the two technicians were found to have used logos of other laboratories in the city as well to forge artificial test reports. The two are in police custody and have been booked under various laws including the one for cheating. Identified as GenePath diagnostic laboratories, the facility has come up with a checklist for their customers to follow, according to a statement released by their corporate communication department. The checklist for authentication of the report includes verification through QR code, identification of the email address of the sender, and availability of the report on the online portal of the lab. “Our report carries a QR-code, which can be scanned using your mobile phone. If this QR-code is not present, the report is not genuine,” read the statement. The arrested technicians used false email IDs with names similar to that of the laboratory, to send the forged reports. “Please check the email id from which the report is sent to you. It will always be an official company email ID, ending with ‘genepathdx.com’. If your report has been sent from any other email service, like Gmail, Yahoo, Hotmail, the report has not been generated from our offices and is fake,” read the second guideline. As a third measure, the lab has made the reports available for download on their official online portal which can be found on genepathdx.com.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/lab-takes-preventive-steps-after-forgery-incident-101618846411590.html

19-04-2021||Pune||PMC takes legal action in cases of bad cheques submitted for property tax||The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has begun taking legal action on property tax holders whose cheque bounced while paying property taxes. Till date, the PMC has sent legal notices to around 200 property tax holders. According to tax department officials, every year there are 2,500-3,000 cases of check bounce. However, the department was not taking any serious cognizance. However, the property tax department has decided to take strict action on cheque bounce cases this year. The PMC legal department has sent notices under Section 138 of the Negotiation Instruments Act to 600 property holders whose cheque bounced for the year of 2019-20. Section 138 is dishonoured for insufficiency of funds or any of the prescribed reasons; the one who defaults can be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to two years or with fine which may extend to twice the amount of the cheque or both. After sending notices, some of the property tax holders paid around ₹5 crore of the amount. The PMC will wait for one month after sending the notices of cheque bounces before filing a case in court. Till date, the PMC legal department has filed four such cases against property tax defaulters. Vilas Kanade, head of property tax department said, “We have started sending legal notices from 2019-20. However, for the first time, we filed cases in court in 2020-21. We found that after notices, people are paying tax to PMC. All defaulters are from the 2019-20 financial year especially in the month of February and March-2021.” According to PMC property tax statistics, the civic body collected ₹1,664.15 crore in revenue in 2020-21 of which, the PMC received ₹828.08 crore through online payments. The amount collected from cheque and demand draft is ₹653.32 crore. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, citizens made a maximum number of online transactions. A total of ₹182.74 crore was paid by cash. The PMC tax department collected a revenue of ₹1,665 crore in 2020-21 against the set target or ₹2,320 crore. According to the PMC tax officials, the collected amount is ₹400 crore more in comparison to the last year’s (2019-20) tax collection. It is an achievement of the PMC during the Covid-19 situation as compared to all municipal corporations in the state. In 2019-20, the PMC set a target of ₹2,320 crore and collected ₹1,262 crore. Now, the PMC property tax department set a target of ₹2,650 crore for 2021-21 financial year. PMC municipal commissioner Vikram Kumar mentioned in the annual budget-2021-22 speech that property tax has emerged as the largest revenue source for the PMC and is expected to continue further as properties from newly merged 23 villages will come under the PMC tax ambit and result in increasing tax collection. The city has 10.81 lakh properties including 11 newly merged villages. Of that, nearly 12.5 per cent are commercial and more than 12.5 per cent are residential. There are 3.5 per cent properties that have an open plot. There are two per cent of properties which are a mix of commercial and residential establishments.Normally, the PMC prepares and distributes property tax bills in the month of April every year. The PMC gives the May 31 deadline to pay bills in which the civic body gives a 5-10 percent discount on the bill. After the month of July, the PMC starts applying a 2 per cent fine for late payment on bills. The PMC gives multiple options such as to pay tax in Citizen Facilitation Centre (CFC) and in banks through cheque, cash and DD. Besides that, the civic body also provides an online option to pay tax. The PMC had also introduced doorstep option to pay property tax in 2019-20. However, it got a very poor response.

19-04-2021||Pune||NSCC proposes concept of co-processing combustible non-recyclable waste||In an attempt to solve the problem of garbage disposal in Pune, the National Society of Clean Cities (NSCC) has proposed a solution to deal with the segregated dry waste that has been accumulating at the dumping grounds. “We are proposing the concept of co-processing of combustible non-recyclable waste collected by PMC. Co-processing is a preferred solution in waste management and ranks higher than incineration and landfill. Co-processing is also recognised as a waste to energy technology in solid waste management rules. Co-processing is substantially beneficial to the industry and community and provides a permanent solution to the waste management problem. It also helps reduce emission, lessens reliance on fossil fuels and preserves natural resources,” said Shyamala Desai, leading the NSCC in Pune. The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has been plagued by the problem of garbage disposal which peaked last year when on August 15, 2020, the garbage dumping area was closed by the residents of Urali Devachi. The PMC also received a notice by the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) and was slapped a fine of ₹20 crore. A cement company has given a written commitment to PMC to process 100 MT/Day combustible non-recyclable dry waste and offered to collect the waste from the municipal corporation. The cement company has agreed to run this trial initially for a month. The waste will be used as a fuel in the manufacture of cement. Cement kilns offer a great opportunity for solving the disposal issue of the combustible fraction. In cement kilns, the dry waste not only gets disposed of in an environmentally sound manner but also gets utilised as an alternative fuel if the quality of the same is tuned to acceptable level of cement kilns. It is then commercially defined as an attractive proposition. “Dry waste free of hazardous waste, stone, metals, bio- medical waste should be sorted and handed over to the cement factory. This waste will be transported for use in their factory in the making of cement. This is RDF which stands for Refuse Derived Fuel. This fuel is produced from combustible components that the industry calls municipal solid waste,” said G Bhaskar, member of the NSCC. He added, “This ‘proof of concept’ trial will initially be carried out for one month or so. If it is viable and satisfies both the parties a long-termagreement may be entered, we can dispose all the waste, dry non-recyclable, that is approximately 700 MT/Day in a more scientific and environmentally friendly way. The co-processing trial requires the consent of the general body of the PMC, which will convene on April 21, whereupon the mayor of Pune will announce a decision.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/nscc-proposes-concept-of-co-processing-combustible-non-recyclable-waste-101618846051564.html

To create options for customers, new techniques of getting business done by these shop owners are being employed. Several non-essential shop owners around the city have put up banners outside their shops giving contact details for those in need of purchasing any product. Similarly, non-essential service providers, like the barbers, have also started circulating contact numbers on social media and are providing home service to customers. “From April first week our shop is closed, but I was getting calls from my regular customers to give home service. Accordingly, we made some social media posts and circulated it amongst our regular customers. Now we daily do home service as per orders,” said Amit Shinde, a barber from the Bajirao road area. Most telephone and electrical shop owners near the Hatti Ganpati mandal and on Tilak road have put up banners outside their closed shutters. “Customers who want to purchase mobile phones or any accessories can contact us directly. According to their requirements, we send them details on WhatsApp and then sell the product. The delivery is to the home or to the address given by the customer,” said Shamsher Khan a mobile shop owner on Tilak road. Even customers are looking at this system to purchase non-essential items. Kushal Das, who purchased a water cooler last week from a shop on Sinhagad road, said, “As summer is going on, I wanted to buy a water cooler urgently.. So I went to a shop where they had given their contact number, selected the product and made the payment online. Within a couple of hours the cooler was delivered to my home.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/nonessential-shop-owners-service-providers-in-pune-tap-homes-for-survival-101618845992191.html
19-04-2021||Delhi||Liquor makers seek home delivery after crowds throng alcohol shops in Delhi||Liquor manufacturers on Monday asked the Delhi government to allow home delivery of alcoholic beverages as tipplers thronged liquor shops forming serpentine queues ahead of the six-day lockdown beginning this evening in the wake of the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic. On Monday as soon as Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal announced a six-day lockdown from 10 PM till 5 AM the next Monday to curb growing cases of Covid-19, a sudden rush of punters was seen outside liquor shops in the national capital with long queues. Citing Maharashtra, which has also gone through tough restrictions and shops are closed in cities like Mumbai to curb the spread of the pandemic, the state government has allowed home delivery, said Confederation of Indian Alcoholic Beverage Companies (CIABC). According to CIABC, there was rush outside liquor vends in Delhi after the announcement of a weeklong lockdown. "What we saw today was the panic reaction from the public, driven by their memory of lockdown extensions last year. For lakhs of people all over India alcohol is part of regular consumption basket that they do not wish to be deprived of," said CIABC Director-General Vinod Giri. The association has hoped that the public and shopkeepers in Delhi adhere to Covid-appropriate behaviour. “Decision of Maharashtra to allow home delivery of liquor, for example, has helped contain panic reaction to lockdown there,” Giri said adding “we urge Delhi Government to think of such steps." The Confederation of Indian Alcoholic Beverage Companies (CIABC) represents domestic liquor makers. Announcing lockdown in the city earlier in the day, Kejriwal said it was necessary to prevent the health system of Delhi from collapsing under the increasing number of patients as there is an acute shortage of medicines, beds, ICUs and oxygen. It further said essential services will be allowed during the lockdown, but private offices and other establishments like shops, malls, weekly markets, manufacturing units, educational and coaching institutes, cinema halls, restaurants, bars, assembly halls, auditoriums, public parks, sport complexes, gyms, spas, barber shops, saloons and beauty parlours will remain closed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/liquor-makers-seek-home-delivery-after-crowds-throng-alcohol-shops-in-delhi-101618844079247.html

19-04-2021||Patna||Bihar gears up for migrants return after CM Nitish Kumar’s appeal||Bihar is preparing for the arrival of migrants in large numbers after chief minister Nitish Kumar asked them to return home at the earliest if they wished. Labour department officials said they will map the returnees and put them in quarantine centres like the previous year when around 2.5 million migrant workers returned to the state after announcement of a nationwide lockdown after Covid-19 pandemic outbreak.“With the chief minister issuing an appeal, it is likely to have an impact and migrants may start returning in large numbers, as the situation is turning worse in Delhi, Maharashtra and other parts, where most of them go for livelihood,” said Bihar labour minister Jibesh Mishra, adding the disaster management department (DMD) has already swung into action..He said “not more than 250,000 migrants may have returned so far”, but this could gather “momentum” following the CM’s appeal.With the number of Covid-19 active cases continuing to maintain an alarmingly high trend in the last one month with record number of infections getting reported almost every day, CM’s appeal to migrants to return “early” is being viewed as a hint of tougher measures in the days to come if the situation fails to improve.“I have asked the labour enforcement officers (LEOs) to keep track of migrants’ flow at the block level. The old system of putting the migrants in the quarantine centres will be revived to check the spread in the rural areas. The government has already announced that quarantine centres will work at the sub division level. Depending on the flow, it may also be planned at the block level,” said Mishra.The minister said a toll-free number—18003456138 was set up to provide information to the migrants. He added that some migrants were reaching railway stations and bus stops in the state and officials will start “mapping” their return.However, opposition parties were not convinced that the state was ready to handle the situation. RJD MP Manoj Jha described CM’s appeal as “empty rhetorical statement” adding it lacked “credibility and substance”.“Contrary to his wishes, the public memory is not that short. The state failed its own people with either poor arrangements or nothing at all at quarantine centres last year. The fudging and manipulation of Covid testing data is known to the whole world. Besides, the recent images of absolute dearth of life saving medicines as well as oxygen is a report card of a CM who loves to live in a make believe world shaped by his trusted bureaucrats,” Jha added.Another RJD leader and MLA, Lalit Yadav claimed that even RT-PCR tests were not happening smoothly in the state and patients were struggling for beds and it was difficult to believe the CM in these circumstances. “There is neither any quarantine centre nor any system in place,” he added.Last year, a sea of migrants arrived at border districts of Nawada, Gaya, Kaimur, Banka, Gopalganj, Siwan and Champaran, mainly from Delhi, UP, West Bengal, Maharashtra, Haryana, Punjab, Chhattisgarh, Orisha, Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh. The government estimate put their number at around 2.5 million- around 1.5 million returned by special trains and another million by buses and other modes of transport.Social analyst DM Diwakar said if the migrants chose to return, it could pose a challenge to the government on multiple fronts.“The pandemic has aggravated the rate of unemployment and created an unprecedented situation of forced return of migrants to their native states. Now a repeat could be more difficult,” he said.Citing a 2020 report ‘Mapping Inequality in Bihar” by AN Sinha Institute of Social Studies and Oxfam India, he said despite double digit growth, Bihar remains at the bottom in terms of development indicators, grappling with land, assets and income inequality, low productivity, limited opportunities of decent work and low demographic development with inter-state and inter-district disparities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-gears-up-for-migrants-return-after-cm-nitish-kumar-s-appeal-101618844072212.html
19-04-2021||Delhi||Delhi HC asks centre to look into oxygen shortage in Delhi as number of Covid-19 infections surge||The Delhi high court on Monday directed the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government in Delhi and the central government to file an affidavit by Tuesday, disclosing the number of beds available across hospitals for Covid-19 patients in the national capital. The HC also asked both the governments to include the details of number of beds with or without ventilators and oxygen support, news agency PTI reported.The high court's remarks came a day after Delhi reported 25,462 new Covid-19 cases on Sunday, its highest single-day surge. Earlier in the day, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said that the city’s health system has reached its limits. “Delhi is facing the fourth wave of Covid-19. 25,000 cases have been reported now. Delhi's health system has reached its limits. I don’t say that the system has collapsed but it has reached its limits,” ANI quoted Kejriwal as saying.The high court also asked the Centre to look into the aspect of shortage of oxygen supply in Delhi hospitals on an urgent basis.Also read | Delhi reports 25,462 Covid cases in a day for first time, positivity rate at 30%Due to the high number of cases and the increased hospitalisations, Kejriwal on Sunday said that the capital city is facing acute shortage of oxygen. “In view of sharply increasing cases, Del needs much more than normal supply. Rather than increasing supply, our normal supply has been sharply reduced and Delhi’s quota has been diverted to other states. OXYGEN HAS BECOME AN EMERGENCY IN DEL,” he tweeted.Also, in a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday, Kejriwal asked for urgent supply of Oxygen to Delhi, ANI reported.Amid the ongoing Covid-19 induced curfews in Delhi, the HC also commented regarding the migrant crisis that both the Centre and the Delhi government have failed in the implementation of last year’s lockdown and there are lessons to be learnt, PTI reported. Earlier in the day, Kejriwal too appealed to the migrant workers to not leave the city and assure of government assistance.The high court also said that the Delhi government’s direction on action against labs that do not deliver test results within 24 hours will not be implemented. “Because of this direction (of the government), labs are not willing to collect samples if they are unable to deliver reports in 24 hours. If any such action is taken by the government, it would only be counter productive. We have to be clear that labs are also hard pressed because of the large numbers they are having today. It would not serve the interest of any laboratory to negligently or deliberately delay the test result,” PTI quoted the bench as saying.Earlier on April 17, Kejriwal during a press conference said that “strict enquiry” will be ordered against labs that pick up more samples than their capacity and take more than 24 hours to deliver the results.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-hc-asks-centre-to-look-into-oxygen-shortage-in-delhi-as-number-of-covid-19-infections-surge-101618842418329.html
19-04-2021||Patna||Bihar sets up monitoring teams for the specially-abled during 2nd Covid wave||Bihar government has created monitoring committees to resolve challenges faced by persons with special abilities during the second wave of Covid-19 pandemic in the state. Formed by the social welfare department, the committees will also ensure that thousands of ‘Divyaang Mitras’ efficiently mitigate the hardships faced by one of the most vulnerable social groups in these challenging times, said an official.The disabilities commissioner of the social welfare department last year created 7051 committees of Divyaang Mitras at the Panchayat level, over 500 at the block level, and more than 91 committees in the subdivisions apart from 38 district-level committees to help the specially-abled during the nationwide lockdown and other restrictions imposed to contain the pandemic, as per government records.The new more viral strain of the coronavirus has led to an unexpected rise in the number of Covid positive cases and also the containment zones, which is feared to create situations causing great stress to the vulnerable group. The monitoring committees have been tasked to track their challenges and ensure they are resolved by the Divyaang Mitras at Panchayat, block and district levels.“There have been reports of the Divyaangs (specially-abled) being in great mental stress this time. The unprecedented increase in the number of positive cases within a few days... the sudden change in the situation has put many of them under great psychological pressure. They are very afraid,” Shivaji Kumar, the disabilities commissioner, said.Santosh Mishra, a specially-abled person from Bakhtiyarpur village in Patna district, said there should have been special arrangements for Covid testing of divyangs . “This is not available. For the test at the health centres, they have to wait for long in the queue of general category people. It’s quite exhausting for us,” he said and added they were forced to return three days later to the health centre to collect the report. “It may not be a problem for normal people. But the physically challenged persons, it’s quite difficult. In fact, visiting hospital is a big problem for a Divyaang and the delay in the report is very discouraging,” he said.Anurag, another Divyaang, said it was sad that the specially-abled were not prioritised for vaccination. “Though some managed to get to the health centre for vaccination, there is no separate arrangement for them,” he said.Dheeraj Kumar, a Divyaang Mitra from Tharthari Panchayat in Nalanda district said they were facing mental stress . “In fact, they are worried how to survive and sustain during lockdown and curfew. ... Some among them manage to earn through menial works like selling boiled eggs or street food on roadside or mend shoes. All these activities are stopped during pandemic lockdown,” he said. Last time many among them had to starve for days. In fact, the foodgrains provided by the government, was given at public distribution centres, but many among them did not have ration cards at that time, he added. They fear that the crisis of food that they had to go through last year may repeat again, he said.The disabilities commissioner agreed that the challenges persisted despite the creation of the Divyang Mitra committees. “The specially-abled in containment zones are in greater trouble because of their total dependency on others for even basic needs and food items, he said and added that persons with special abilities turn out to be the worst victim in situations like a pandemic outbreak and lockdown.“The kind of stress and fear it creates among those suffering from cerebral palsy or behavioral problems, is quite unimaginable by general people,” said the officer.Dheeraj Kumar said divyaangs need sources of earning during Covid. “Hunger is their biggest concern. Last year I drew attention of the officials at block level to get them some job under MGNREGA (Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act) and got their job cards made.

More than 52,400 people recovered while 351 succumbed to the disease and the total recoveries and deaths have gone up to 3,159,240 and 60,824 respectively, the bulletin showed.The state capital Mumbai also recorded a fall after 7,381 people tested positive for the disease in the last 24 hours. The caseload in the city is at 586,867 and deaths have climbed to 12,412 of which 58 new were added in the last 24 hours.This reduction in the daily cases of Maharashtra as well as Mumbai can be attributed to less number of tests conducted on Sunday, which is a holiday. Maharashtra tested 221,626 samples for Covid-19 in the last 24 hours while authorities in Mumbai conducted tests for 36,556 samples during the same period. On Saturday, Maharashtra and Mumbai tested 273,272 and 46,971 samples respectively.Also Read| Covid-19 vaccine for everyone above 18 from May 1, PM Modi gives go aheadMaharashtra currently is the worst hit state from the pandemic across the country.

19-04-2021||Pune||Delay in truck carrying oxygen supply left two Pune Covid hospitals hit panic button||PUNE: The acute demand-supply gap of oxygen facility left the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) administration in an unprecedented crisis situation when the truck carrying medical oxygen got delayed on Monday. The possible shortage of oxygen could have affected the patients of 800-bed Covid jumbo facility at the College of Engineering Pune (COEP) and Dalvi hospital. The daily oxygen demand of COEP Covid jumbo facility is 16 tonnes. According to PMC, on Monday, the truck with medical oxygen supply was running as per schedule till 11 am and the COEF jumbo facility was prepared to use the reserved facility if the vehicle was delayed by some time. However, the truck’s delay prolonged and later it travelled under escort from Chakan. The hospitals’ reserved oxygen supply had touched an alarming level with stock for only a few minutes. The jumbo hospital faced a similar situation last week, said one of the officials of the facility on condition of anonymity. Dalvi hospital administration also faced oxygen shortage situation on Monday due to delay in arrival of the truck carrying fresh supply. Rajendra Muthe, an official at Jumbo facility said, “There was a delay in arrival of the truck carrying oxygen cylinders and we had faced a similar situation four days ago. We always keep reserved stock for emergency, but the truck’s delay was unexpected. Now, we will increase the demand of oxygen supply to address these possible situations.” PMC official Srinivas Kandul, who is coordinating the oxygen supply for municipal hospitals, said, “The sudden spike in demand of oxygen supply has made coordination a challenging job, but we are doing better.” “As patients are not getting beds, various elected members and some groups are erecting oxygen bed facility at various localities. Though the move is for a good cause, it is putting additional pressure on the civic administration to provide oxygen facility to these new medical centres and the demand further shoots up.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/delay-in-truck-carrying-oxygen-supply-left-two-pune-covid-hospitals-hit-panic-button-101618841491224.html
19-04-2021||Lucknow||‘Incapacitated medical infrastructure’: Allahabad HC raps UP govt, directs lockdown in 5 cities||The Allahabad High Court on Monday directed the Uttar Pradesh government to strictly enforce the closure of all establishments (government or private) in five cities till April 26, 2021. The restriction will be applicable in Prayagraj, Lucknow, Varanasi, Kanpur Nagar and Gorakhpur.“The recent surge of Covid-19 pandemic has virtually incapacitated all our medical infrastructure in the State of UP and especially in cities like Prayagraj, Lucknow, Varanasi, Kanpur and Gorakhpur,” the court stated.However, financial institutions and departments, medical and health services, industrial and scientific establishments, essential services including municipal functions, and public transport will be exempt from the curbs. The court clarified that it is not imposing a complete lockdown in the state by its order.The bench comprising justice Siddhartha Varma and justice Ajit Kumar observed, “Above directions are nowhere close to a complete lockdown. We are conscious of the fact that before imposing a lockdown the concerned government has to work out various modalities. In this order, if we have not imposed a lockdown it does not mean that we do not believe in it. We are still of the view that if we want to break the chain, a lockdown for a duration of at least two weeks is a must.”“We, therefore, once again in addition to the directions we have already given, direct the government to consider the imposition of a complete lockdown in the entire state for at least a period of two weeks. This would not only break the chain of the spread of the virus but would also give respite to health workers,” the bench added.Also read: ‘Mask not needed in car,’ says Delhi couple arrested for misbehaving with copsThe bench passed the order in a suo moto PIL on conditions of quarantine centres in the state and treatment of Covid-19 patients. The court further directed the state government to ensure grocery shops and other commercial shops, excluding medical shops, with more than three workers remain closed till April 26, 2021. Likewise, all malls, shopping complexes, restaurants, eateries shall remain close till April 26.Further, with respect to the five cities, all religious places shall also remain shut for the period and no social function except weddings should be allowed. However, no more than 25 people will be allowed in case of wedding functions without the permission of the concerned district magistrate.Vegetable and milk hawkers will be allowed to sell goods on road only till 11 am and all public movement on roads will be restricted completely subject to these directions. Public movement is also permitted by the court in case of medical help and emergencies.On the rise in the number of Covid-19 patients, the beach said, “it appears that the pandemic is teasing the system in a situation where patients have outnumbered the hospital beds and people are just running from pillar to post and in this process attendants of patients are not only getting infected but others in public are also getting infected and a complete chain has got formed.”During the hearing, the court was informed that the state government is taking steps to increase the number of beds for patients such as three makeshift hospitals with 1,000 beds at Lucknow and to increase 20 beds per day in Prayagraj.On this, the court observed, “One would only laugh at us that we have enough to spend on elections and very little to spend on public health…. One cannot even imagine what will happen if only 10% of the city population gets infected and needs medical help in hospitals. How the government will manage with the presently existing infrastructure is anybody’s guess.”“Economy, economy and economy is the only tune that the government is all the time harping upon but if you take bread and butter to a person who needs oxygen and medication, it will be of no use to him. You may have grocery shops full of eatables and industries which produce bikes and cars but all this won’t be of any use if your medical shops run out of stock of life-saving drugs like Remdesivir in the current surge of the pandemic. It is a shame that while the government knew of the magnitude of the second wave, it never planned things in advance,” the bench observed.Also read: At PM Modi’s review meet, India expands vaccinations for everyone above the ageOn Panchayat election conducted during the pandemic, the bench observed, “We must record our displeasure at the way government and the State Election Commission proceeded to hold elections forcing teachers and other government staff to perform duties exposing themselves to the threat of pandemic that looms large these days. The police were virtually shifted to polling places giving priority to election above public health.”“Further, the photographs of the various places where elections were held show that no social distancing was maintained. Also, we find that on many occasions in various political rallies masks were never worn by people,” the court said while directing authorities to take actions against erring organisers of political events and place the action by the next date of hearing on April 26.On delay in providing Covid-19 test reports to patients, the bench said, “We have been informed that people are developing influenza-like infections in every fifth house of every Mohalla in the city and tracking-tracing and testing system, if not failed, has certainly not been able to meet the requirement of the population of thecity. Reports are neither updated before 72 hours nor are samples taken care of, owing to shortage of manpower. Only VVIPs are getting reports within 6-12 hours. Thus early testing scheme or plan is a farce.” The court said that if in any civilised society, the public health system is unable to meet the challenges and people die for want of proper medication, it means there has been no proper development. “Health and education go side-by-side. Those in the helm of affairs of governance are to be blamed for the present chaotic health problems and more so when there is a democracy which means a government of the people, by the people and for the people,” the bench observed.Uttar Pradesh, one of the worst-hit states from the pandemic, has reported a total of over 8.5 lakh Covid-19 cases till date with over 9,800. Over 6.5 patients have recovered from the deadly contagion in the state so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/incapacitated-medical-infrastructure-allahabad-hc-raps-up-govt-directs-lockdown-in-5-cities-101618840891908.html

The five states include Kerala, Goa, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Uttarakhand and Delhi-NCR. In a tweet, Sawant called on his Maharashtra counterpart to “put up a combined fight against this pandemic under the leadership of PM Narendra Modi.” “I urge @CMOMaharashtra not to single out states as ‘Places of Sensitive Origin’, and withdraw the said order in public interest,” Sawant tweeted. On Sunday evening, Maharashtra’s chief secretary issued an order declaring the states as places of sensitive origin under the Epidemic Diseases Act, “in order to curb the transmission of the Covid-19 virus in the state and to stop the influx of other Covid-19 virus variants into the state of Maharashtra from other locations.”Sawant’s request has however been met with ‘suggestions’ that he should also impose similar restrictions on people entering the state. “Sir, CM of Maharashtra is only doing his job of protecting his people. Instead of only indulging in politics, we Goans request you to do your job and put in restrictions at our borders to protect us also,” AAP leader Valmiki Naik said. Sawant has faced persistent requests to begin screening people entering the state, especially with the recent surge in cases in other parts of the country. But Sawant has resisted doing so, claiming it will affect tourism in the state and the government is dependent on tourism for economic survival.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/goa-cm-calls-on-maharashtra-cm-to-withdraw-order-on-places-of-sensitive-origin-101618834771600.html

It is likely to be ready by the end of the mango season.CISH is developing the museum so that the visitors can learn about the varieties, medicinal value, products, history and little-known facts about the fruit.“The museum will have more than 800 varieties as a model or a photograph with interesting descriptions. Not only Indian, but also the varieties dominating the international market will be displayed,” said Shailendra Rajan, CISH director.The institute had one of the largest live collections of mango varieties, but one could not see them after the fruiting season, he said.“Mango (tree) is considered to provide certain anti-viral, anti-bacterial, anti-carcinogenic bioactive compounds and a few of them have been found to be reported effective in immunity-boosting against the coronavirus,” he added.“A database containing details of the medicinal properties of phytochemicals can be accessed in the museum. A description of important products made from mango and the nutritive value of the king of fruits will also be depicted,” Rajan said.A large number of recipes are available in which mangoes are used at the raw or ripe stages. One can see the details of these useful recipes in the museum, he said.A portion of the museum will depict the numerous pests and diseases that attack the mango. Rajan said the museum would help in explaining several unrevealed facts about the mango. This will be of interest not only to children but also to the farmers, he said.National Mango Database will be connected to one of the panels of the museum. The museum was supposed to have become functional during the current mango season but got delayed due to the Covid-19 situation.The CISH director also said, “ More than a hundred stamps depicting the mangoes have been issued by about 80 countries. A corner with these stamps and details will be an attraction for the visitors, mainly people interested in philately.”Considered a heritage tree of India, a lot of history, mythology culture, religion, and other social aspects are associated with the mango. The major mango-producing areas of the country and the world, statistics, and other intresting facts will be depicted with various audiovisuals explaining their economic importance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/coming-up-mango-museum-on-lucknow-outskirts-101618834470908.html

The man and his wife were arrested during weekend curfew on Sunday.On Monday, the man, identified as Pankaj Dutta, said that he feels the mask is not for a couple in a car. "We had face masks with us but we didn't wear them because we felt that it was not for a couple in a car," said Dutta, a resident of West Patel Nagar in Delhi.His wife Abha Yadav said she feels suffocated while wearing a mask and also gave logic for why Covid-19 appropriate behaviour should not be followed in a car."I feel suffocation and breathing problems when I wear mask. Logically, I thought that it was not needed in the car as I was with my husband only. My opinion is that mask must be worn at public places," said Yadav.While the man was arrested on Sunday, Abha Yadav was arrested on Monday, the police said.A video of the incident was shared on social media platforms, wherein the couple could be seen misbehaving with Delhi police personnel when they were asked the reason for not wearing masks.In the video, Abha Yadav can be heard saying, “…I have cleared UPSC…”. One of the policemen then told her that since she has cleared the civil services examination, conducted by the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC), she should behave in a more responsible manner with respect to the Covid-19 norms in place. “Why should I wear a mask in my car? What if I have to kiss my husband?" the woman can be heard asking them.Watch: Delhi couple stopped for not wearing masks, misbehaves with copsThe couple was taken to the Daryaganj police station and a first information report (FIR) under various sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) was registered against them."During interrogation, the man put the blame on his wife and told police that his wife does not wear mask and also does not lets him wear the same. However, he claimed that whenever she is not around, he always wears a mask," a senior police officer said.The Delhi high court had said earlier this month that a mask is compulsory even if a person is driving alone in a private vehicle. A car will be considered a "public place", the court had ruled, terming mask as 'suraksha kavach (safety armour)'.Delhi has been witnessing a surge in number of Covid-19 cases, prompting the Arvind Kejriwal-led government to impose lockdown-like measures in the national capital from April 19 till next Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/mask-not-needed-in-car-says-delhi-couple-arrested-for-misbehaving-with-cops-101618833828627.html

The spike, he said, could be attributed to the new variant, along with people coming back from large gatherings outside Punjab. The figure was expected to go up further with more testing, he said, adding that by May 5, the state was projected to report 6,000 cases a day if urgent measures were not implemented in Ludhiana, Mohali, Jalandhar , Amritsar and Patiala, which would be the drivers of the spike. Dr KK Talwar, head of the Covid expert task force, said more restrictions were needed to check further surge, as the situation was worrying, given the way things had happened in Delhi, and with the virus clearly mutating.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-clamps-down-with-stricter-curbs-cuts-down-test-rates-101618833811542.html

Priyanka was visiting her parents with her son Yagya to celebrate Chaiti Chhath. According to neighbours, Sharma’s house was locked from outside and thus the duo could not escape the fire on time. “Priyanka’s father had gone to his native place a few days back and she was living with her mother and son. It seems her mother locked them and went outside to pick flowers. After we saw smoke coming out of their flat, we tried to break the lock, but we failed to do so,” said a neighbour, who wished not to be named. The local fire and police station were informed around 6am, he added.Danapur fire officer Inderjeet Kumar Sharma said his team failed to extinguish the fire even after several hours of effort since the flat was located on the fourth floor. “Two domestic LPG cylinders kept inside the flat also caught fire which intensified the blaze. Finally, with the help of a hydraulic water tanker, we got control over the fire. The mother and son were found severely injured,” he said.Priyanka’s brother-in-law Satish Kumar said they were rushed to a nearby hospital but could not survive. He added that her husband Yogendra Prasad was in Chhattisgarh and her in-laws lived near AG Colony in Patna.Danapur police station house officer (SHO) Ajeet Kumar Shah said the cause of the fire had not been established yet and a probe was on. “Huge quantity of wood was kept on the floor which further fuelled the fire,” he added.Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar expressed grief over the incident. He said Sharma was associated with him since 1989.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/motherson-killed-in-a-fire-in-patna-residential-complex-101618831891383.html
19-04-2021||Other||Punjab drive to end fancy number culture hits hurdle||The Punjab government’s drive to put brakes on the VIP culture of vintage vehicle registration numbers has hit a speedbreaker. Despite orders to discontinue old fancy registration numbers, also called vintage numbers, in December, about 100 owners have approached the state transport department for a new number so far. The authorities say there are thousands of such vehicles with fancy numbers, mainly owned by politicians, bureaucrats and influential people, in the state. A huge amount of money and irregularities are involved in the registration and renewal process during the sale and purchase of the vintage numbers. Sources say there are nearly 200 series of numbers, including PIB, PAC, PUP, PAP, PCR and PAU, that have been discontinued by the department. Also read: Navy recovers 300 kg narcotics worth ₹3,000 crore from fishing vesselIn December last year, chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh had ordered the discontinuation of the old registration numbers that were in use even after the enforcement of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988. The aim was to end the VIP culture and curb illegal activities. The transport department was asked to issue alternative numbers to owners of vehicles with such numbers, which were already banned in neighbouring Haryana and Himachal Pradesh, according to Section 217 (read with Section 41) of the Motor Vehicles Act. Irregularities by former officials delay process An official dealing with the registration of such numbers blamed the delay on technical issues. “We have not been able to trace the tax records of the owners of vehicles with vintage numbers, which is mandatory, because of the irregularities by former officials. Some of them used backlog entries in the system, especially in Faridkot district, to register such numbers,” he said. Requesting anonymity, an official privy to the development said that all big political families and MLAs of the state are among those who surrendered their vintage numbers, but many bureaucrats and influential people have not surrendered their numbers. Status symbol becomes security risk Many vehicle owners prefer to retain old registration numbers as a status symbol but it’s a security risk in the border state of Punjab, an official said. Vehicles with VIP numbers are often misused by anti-social elements to carry out subversive activities as these vehicles are not stopped for checking by the police. “With such registration numbers used on multiple vehicles over the years, identification of original owners is difficult since old records are either untraceable or have been destroyed to accommodate VIPs,” the official said. Senior transport department officials that insurance companies will stop ensuring such vehicles as the numbers have been discontinued and violators will face action. When contacted, state transport commissioner Amarpal Singh was not available for comment. Vintage number owners approach court Some vintage number owners have moved the Punjab and Haryana high court against the Punjab government’s decision to discontinue the pre-1988 Motor Vehicles Act numbers. A senior transport department official said people are awaiting the verdict. Harjinder Singh Sidhu, who filed the petition in the high court, said his vehicle carries the registration number, PUI0007, bearing the high-security registration number plant according to provisions of the Motor Vehicles Act. Besides, the details have been uploaded on the Centre’s m-Parivahan portal. He said that the action of the authorities in calling upon the petitioner to surrender his registration No. PUI0007 would be in violation of the mandate under Section 217-A of the Motor Vehicles Act. The next hearing in the matter is on May 10. Deputy state transport commissioner Manjit Singh said that court has clubbed the bunch of petitions, but no stay has been granted on the Punjab government’s orders so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/punjab-drive-to-end-fancy-number-culture-hits-hurdle-101618830692275.html
19-04-2021||Mumbai||BJP's agenda to ensure Maharashtra govt fails in handling Covid: Sena on Remdesivir row||The Shiv Sena on Monday slammed BJP leaders Devendra Fadnavis and Pravin Darekar for objecting to Mumbai police's grilling of a pharma firm's top executive over alleged stocking of Remdesivir vials, and wondered if there was a conspiracy to disturb the law and health order.An editorial in the Sena mouthpiece 'Saamana' accused the BJP of having a clear agenda that the Maharashtra government should fail in handling the Covid-19 situation, and charged it with making persistent efforts in that direction with the help of the Centre.It said the Maharashtra government and the opposition should be unanimous at least on the issue of saving lives of people and no one should seek political mileage out of pyres of people dying for want of the drug, which is in high demand for treating Covid-19 patients.Mumbai police questioned a pharma company director on Saturday following information that thousands of vials of Remdesivir were to be flown out of the country, despite a ban on its export.On learning that the company director was being questioned, former chief minister Fadnavis and another state BJP leader Darekar had rushed to the police station.They said the BJP was reaching out to pharma companies due to the shortage of Remdesivir in the state.Fadnavis said it was their sincere attempt to get Remdesivar for Maharashtra.However, the editorial in 'Saamana' on Monday alleged that politics is being played on the issue of supply of oxygen and Remdesivir injections for treating Covid-19 patients.It said the Maharashtra government was not getting the Remdesivir injections, but BJP leaders were purchasing them unilaterally from pharma companies.It never happened in Maharashtra earlier that the Leader of Opposition advocated for a pharma company official instead of the state, the Sena said."Isn't there a conspiracy to trouble the law and health order?" it asked.The Sena claimed it is a "crime" on part of the companies to make available stock of the injections to the BJP unilaterally.It also questioned the BJP's criticism of the government after the police exposed hoarding and black marketing by the companies."What can the opposition leaders in the Assembly and Council rushing to a police station mid-night to seek release of a pharma company official be called?" the Shiv Sena asked.The Covid-19 patients in Maharashtra and the country are feeling suffocated due to lack of oxygen and funeral pyres have been lit for the want of Remdesivir, it said."Nobody should heat up (their) political pans on these pyres. The government and the opposition should behave unanimously at least on this issue," the Marathi daily said.Union minister Piyush Goyal on Saturday said Maharashtra has so far received the highest quantity of oxygen in India and the Centre is in regular touch with state governments to assess their needs.Referring to it, the Shiv Sena asked whether the Centre was doing any favour to Maharashtra by giving the highest quantity of oxygen.Maharashtra is making the highest contribution to the Centre's coffers, the editorial said, adding that Delhi (the central government) will need oxygen support if this supply (of tax payment) is stopped (from the state)."...when Maharashtra is facing a crisis, the Union minister is troubling Maharashtra by giving an account of how much has been given and taken (to the state). This is sort of staining the humanity," it alleged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bjps-agenda-to-ensure-maha-govt-fails-in-handling-covid-sena-on-remdesivir-row-101618829157726.html

"In view of the curfew imposed in Delhi from 10 pm today till 5am on 26 April, Delhi Metro services will be available during the morning (8 AM to 10 AM) and evening (5 PM to 7 PM) peak hours across the network with a headway (frequency) of 30 minutes," DMRC said."For rest of the hours of the day, metro rail services across the network will be available with a frequency of 60 min only. Services during this period can be availed only by the exempted category of people on the production of the valid IDs," the statement further said.Delhi Metro will operate with 50% capacity during the curfew period and services linked to the Delhi Metro like the feeder bus services will ply with 50% of their seating capacity. Along with the Delhi Metro, Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) and the Delhi Integrated Multi-Modal Transit System (DIMTS) will also ply with 50% capacity due to the rise in cases. The Delhi government has also allowed taxis, auto-rickshaws, cabs, 'Gramin Sewa' and 'Phat-Phat Sewa' along with e-rickshaws to ply with maximum 2 passengers. People going for medical services, to and from airports and railway stations will be exempted during the week-long curfew. The decision to impose a week-long curfew came as Delhi saw its positivity rate increasing as the Capital reported record single-day surges in Covid-19 cases since the onset of the pandemic. The government fears that is the lockdown-like measures are not introduced more people will fall sick leading to a collapse of the healthcare infrastructure in the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-metro-to-ply-from-8am-to-10am-5pm-to-7pm-during-peak-hours-amid-weeklong-101618828789308.html
19-04-2021||Pune||Monday musings: How, and why, Pune’s Covid scenario went from bad to worse||Last week, we had two spells of thunderstorms accompanied by heavy showers in Pune. That brought respite to the city suffering from the scorching sun. The cool breeze that followed should have brought cheer to many, but in these gloomy times, it went largely unnoticed. The current gloom is akin to September last year, when Pune saw many dying without beds or ambulances. In fact its intensity is even more this time, given that many were out happily violating Covid norms. As a result, the second wave is hitting many of those who successfully kept the virus at bay during first outbreak. The overall case fatality rate has been low this time amid a rising caseload, but there are horrific stories of the virus ravaging families. Pune was one of the worst affected districts in the country during first wave, overtaking Delhi and Mumbai in terms of active case load in September 2020. This time too, it maintained that status, except that the capacity of local government along with state administration has been exposed like never before. How has the political leadership dealt with the situation so far? The answer, many would say, not up to the mark. While those representing the PMC have blamed the state government, which in turn passed the buck onto the Centre, for various kinds of shortages. On the ground, leadership at the local body level or from the state and Centre, continues to be missing in action. Maharashtra has two most powerful ministers from Pune – deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, who also holds the finance portfolio; and home minister, Dilip Walse Patil – besides junior minister Dattatray Bharne. While Pawar has been reviewing the situation in Pune district every Friday, his absence in the city on other days is largely conspicuous at a time when a five million population is facing an unprecedented situation. Walse Patil, a labour minister until recently, isn’t visible anywhere, while Bharne’s focus is limited to his constituency of Indapur. The city has six BJP MLAs and two from the NCP, though Puneites have not heard much from them as regards making an effort to ramp-up health capacities goes. Pune also has representation at the Centre with Prakash Javadekar being a minister in Narendra Modi’s cabinet. Javadekar is also tasked with the responsibility to coordinate with Maharashtra to cater to state’s needs on the Covid front. His presence in Pune though is only felt intermittently; the most recent being last week, when he announced that Pune will get 165 ventilators. His colleague Girish Bapat is seen at agitations on issues like restarting the public transport service of Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Limited (PMPML). It’s a fact that Pune has created a ventilator-bed capacity equal to Mumbai and Delhi. This, though Pune doesn’t have big government hospitals like AIIMS. However, this was possible mostly due to private partnership as public infrastructure is falling short. Even after district administration’s order, the supply of anti-viral drug Remdesivir hasn’t been restored with demand outgrowing supply in terms of the number of doses Pune is getting. On April 9, NCP chief Sharad Pawar managed to directly source 480 vials for Baramati alone when the city was scrambling for the drug, which many believe is life saver. On the vaccination front, Pune has had lead, though in the past one week, it lost momentum as a result of a drop in supply of doses, for which the state has rightly blamed the Centre. The capacities of the state government and local civic body in Pune have been found wanting even when they had a whole year to ramp-up infrastructure. When Amravati and Yavatmal districts in Maharashtra reported a 40% daily positivity rate, it should have sounded the alarm bells. However, from PMC, to the state government, to those representing Pune at the centre, were complacent. The result - horrific stories like the entire Jadhav family of four wiped out by the virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/monday-musings-how-and-why-pune-s-covid-scenario-went-from-bad-to-worse-101618828711664.html
19-04-2021||Jaipur||More given to Gujarat: Rajasthan minister claims discrimination in oxygen supply||Rajasthan health minister Raghu Sharma on Monday accused the Centre of discrimination, claiming while 1,200 metric tonne oxygen was being supplied to Gujarat, his state got only 124 metric tonne even though both have similar Covid-19 situations.Referring to a liquid oxygen plant in Alwar's Bhiwadi which was under the state's control, the minister said, "There was no lack of oxygen last time. This time, when there is more need of oxygen, the Centre has taken over all the medical oxygen generator plants and the oxygen distribution network.""There are equal number of Covid-19 cases in Rajasthan and Gujarat. In Gujarat, 1,200 metric tonne oxygen is being supplied, whereas Rajasthan is getting only 124 metric tonne," he claimed."If oxygen is not made available adequately, how will we save lives of people," the minister questioned.Sharma further said that the Rajasthan government has ordered procurement of 1,500 oxygen condensers, which will provide oxygen to 3,000 patients.But more oxygen will be required to fight the disease, he added.The health minister also targeted the Centre over the shortage of vaccines, and said seven lakh vaccine doses are required in the state daily.The Rajasthan government wrote to the prime minister and the Union health minister, after which the state received 14 lakh doses, which will be administered in two days, Sharma said.The state has full storage capacity and a bumper stock of 15 days should be provided which will help it save many lives, he added.Sharma said the shortage of tocilizumab and remdesivir should also be addressed by the Centre.He added that the vaccination against Covid-19 should be opened up for all.The minister appealed to the people to follow lockdown-like restrictions during the "Jan Andolan Pakhwada (Self Discipline Fortnight)" till May 3.From April 1 to 18, over 131 Covid-19 deaths were reported in the state. In the entire month of March, Rajasthan had reported just 31 fatalities.The state recorded 10,242 coronavirus cases and 42 deaths on Sunday.The cumulative tally of positive cases and deaths have increased to 4,14,617 and 3,151, respectively.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/more-given-to-gujarat-rajasthan-minister-claims-discrimination-in-oxygen-supply-101618827847678.html

The FIR was filed on Friday over misappropriation of ₹207 crore, the agency said.The agency came across irregularities while conducting a surprise check at the accounts department of DUSIB on April 13. It revealed that between September 1, 2020 and March 31, 2021, investments of about ₹214 crore was made using the funds of DUSIB in the form of 112 fixed deposit receipts (FDRs) with Bank of Baroda's Paharganj branch in New Delhi, the agency said."The 112 FDRs issued by which were purportedly issued by BOB, Paharganj, are only printouts on A4 size papers and are not security papers," the CBI further said.The surprise check also revealed that DUSIB is maintaining accounts only with Central Bank of India and none of its accounts is maintained with Bank of Baroda, according to CBI.The unknown bank officials have been booked for criminal conspiracy, forgery and criminal breach of trust.The Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board (DUSIB) functions under the control of government of NCT of Delhi. According to its website, the board functions under the purview of the DUSIB Act, 2010 which empowers it to notify certain areas as slums, where with the passage of time, the buildings have become dilapidated and the basic civic services are missing.The Slum and JJ Department, which was earlier part of Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD), was transferred to this board after its creation on July 1, 2010.The DUSIB is primarily responsible for improving the quality of the life of slum and dwellers of Jhuggie Jhomprie (JJ) in Delhi.

19-04-2021||Other||Govt may enforce consumer laws to protect Covid victims in need of medicines, beds||Long queues are nothing new in India . But the serpentine queues that we see today, for hospital admissions, for oxygen cylinders, for Remdesivir, for Covid-19 test, for test results, for the cremation and burial of the dead are very different from the routine queues that we are used to. The anxiety, fear, despair and the sorrow that one sees on the faces of those in the queue, bring home the failure of the administration at all levels, to protect the citizens/consumers during the biggest medical emergency that we have faced in the country in recent times.The desperate scramble for hospital beds, exploitative prices at private hospitals, severe shortage of sanitizers and masks and the consequent blackmarketing of these essential goods, were all part of the first phase of Covid-19 last year. There were also instances of stockpiling and overpricing of medical oxygen and essential drugs used for prevention and treatment of Covid-19, including Remdesivir.Given that experience and the exponential rise in the number of cases in this second wave, the governments at the centre as well as in the states should have anticipated severe shortages and the consequent exploitation of consumers and taken adequate measures well in time to not only augment supplies of all essential medicines and medical equipment , but also prevent hoarding and black marketing. In the absence of such measures, consumers today have to beg for hospital beds, Remdesivir, oxygen cylinders, plasma, ventilators, Covid tests and the results of the tests. They are also exposed to racketeers in the garb of drug distributors, chemists, ward boys, nurses and even doctors, selling Remdesivir at five to ten times its maximum retail price. When demand spikes and goods become scarce, black marketers and hoarders invariably spring into action to exploit the most vulnerable - the consumer. This is not a new phenomenon and there are several laws to help the government deal with such emergent situations. The Essential Commodities Act, 1955, for example, gives the government sweeping powers to ramp up production, regulate distribution, sale and even the price of goods declared as ‘essential’ in public interest.. The Prevention of Blackmarketing and Maintenance of Supplies of Essential Commodities Act, 1980, even provides for preventive detention. Similarly, Clause 26 of the Drugs (Prices Control) Order says, “No person shall sell any formulation to any consumer at a price exceeding the price specified in the current price list or price indicated on the label of the container or pack thereof, whichever is less.” Violation can invite imprisonment up to seven years and fine. There are also other laws like the Disaster Management Act, the Drugs and Cosmetics Act and the Indian Penal code to protect consumer interest in these situations. Yet, consumers are being forced to run from pillar to post for life saving medicines and medical equipment and having to pay exorbitant prices for their procurement. The State has surely let the consumers down in these difficult times. During the first wave, despite the fact that we were dealing with a new, unknown enemy, we managed to overcome the difficulties and eventually emerged victorious, because of quick interventions by the State. This time, the previous experience and the lessons learnt from last year, should have helped us deal with this crisis even better. But that has not happened. In fact, the superspreader events like the election rallies and the Kumbh Mela made one wonder whether the government was even aware that we were in the midst of a raging Covid pandemic.At least now, the governments at the centre and the states need to come together and devote all their resources to overcome this medical emergency. Experts warn that this wave will peak only in mid or late May-that means we are yet to see the worst of this. So only emergency measures implemented on a war footing can save the country. It’s not an easy task at this late stage, but not impossible. Consumers in the meanwhile need to be more responsible --- wear a three layered face mask and a shield too to be on the safer side and most important of all, shun all gatherings ----political, religious, social and cultural.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/govt-may-enforce-consumer-laws-to-protect-covid-victims-in-need-of-medicines-beds-101618827331920.html

More than hospital beds, we are seeing a shortage of ICU beds," Sudhakar said.Speaking to reporters here ahead of the crucial meeting with legislators and Ministers from the city, he said, we will discuss on how to bring it under control and measures to be taken in this regard."Giving treatment is one part of it, we will also have to control the spike in infections and bring it down, for that we will have to certainly impose restrictions on some activities. We will have to think in that direction and take advice from everyone," he added.Chief Minister Yediyurappa who is currently undergoing treatment for Covid at a private hospital, will be attending the meeting virtually, his office said in a statement.Noting that the suggestions given by the state's Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) on Covid with scientific inputs will be crucial, Sudhakar said, keeping all these aspects in mind the government will take a decision.Responding to a question on lockdown, he said, "the term lockdown is getting publicity, the question before us is what kind of strict measures should be taken to bring things under control...we should have clarity on it. Lockdown is not the only solution."People are thinking about normal life being affected, but many lives are getting lost and saving lives is the priority of the government, he said, adding "so we will discuss about the measure to be taken at the meeting today, and tomorrow Chief Minister will be talking to leaders of opposition parties via video conference, following which we will come to a final decision."Not giving clarity on whether tough measures will be announced Monday, the Minister said, "it can't be said now itself, may be measures for Bengaluru will be announced today or as there is meeting with leaders of opposition parties tomorrow, after getting inputs from there and discussing with Ministers, officials and TAC, a decision may be announced."The meeting with leaders of opposition parties that was scheduled for Sunday was cancelled after Yediyurappa tested positive for Covid.The state had on Sunday reported the biggest ever spike of 19,067 new Covid cases and 81 deaths taking the total number infections to 11,61,065 and the toll to 13,351.The total number of active cases stood at 1,33,543.Out of the 19,067 new cases on Sunday, 12,793 were from Bengaluru alone.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/karnataka-health-minister-indicates-at-strict-covid-19-control-measures-as-daily-new-infections-surge-101618821303816.html

For this if the vaccines need to be imported, the Centre should do it," she said in a tweet.The former Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh also appealed people to follow Covid protocol issued by state governments."Simultaneously, I request people to strictly adhere to Covid guideline issued by state governments so that the outbreak of the virus can be prevented," she said."Apart from it, the coronavirus is now affecting the youth as well, which is becoming a matter of concern. Therefore, the BSP demands the Central government that it should reconsider the age limit for vaccination as soon as possible," the leader demanded.Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday chaired a meeting to review the status of preparedness to handle the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic.Prime Minister directed officials that use of Remdesivir and other medicines must be in accordance with approved medical guidelines and their misuse and black marketing must be strictly curbed.On the issue of supply of medical oxygen, the Prime Minister directed that the installation of approved medical oxygen plants should be sped up. 162 PSA Oxygen plants are being installed in 32 States/UTs from PM CARES. The officers informed that 1 lakh cylinders are being procured and they will be supplied to states soon.

The information in this regard shall be uploaded on the websites of the Delhi district courts, the order stated.Delhi on Sunday recorded the biggest jump in its daily Covid-19 infection tally with 25,462 fresh cases, while the positivity rate shot up to 29.74% -- meaning almost every third sample being tested in the city is turning out to be positive. The Arvind Kejriwal-led government has deployed two teams of officers to monitor procurement and supply of oxygen and the Remdesivir drug amid a shortage of both following an exponential rise in Covid-19 cases in the national capital.The Delhi high court circular with regard to the functioning of the district courts comes a day after the high court issued a similar order on Sunday regarding its own functioning. All Delhi high court benches will only take up "extremely urgent matters" filed this year from April 19, the order stated.Earlier on April 8, the Delhi high court had decided that from April 9 to April 23 it will take up matters "through virtual mode only" in view of the rise in Covid-19 cases.

19-04-2021||Delhi||Delhi to impose week-long curfew from tonight||The Delhi government will impose a six-day curfew in the national Capital from 10pm tonight till 5am on April 26 to curb the spread of Covid-19 as the city reported around 23,500 fresh cases in the last 24 hours, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said on Monday. Addressing a press conference, the chief minister said Delhi’s health infrastructure has been pushed to its limit with nearly 25,000 Covid-19 cases being reported every day. He said a lockdown at this time is required not just to break the chain of the fast spreading infection, but also to augment health infrastructure on a large scale including beds, oxygen supply and life saving drugs.“Delhi’s health system is now unable to take in more patients. It is now necessary to impose a lockdown in Delhi from 10 pm today to 5 am on Monday (April 26). Essential services will remain open, food and medicine shops will be allowed to operate, weddings will be limited to 50 guests. A detailed order will be released soon,” he said. The decision was taken in a Covid-19 review meeting held between Delhi lieutenant governor Anil Baijal and chief minister Arvind Kejriwal earlier in the day. Delhi already had witnessed a weekend lockdown and a daily night curfew from 10pm to 5am. To prevent an exodus of migrant workers like last year, Kejriwal appealed to all such workers to stay where they are. “I am requesting all migrant workers with folded hands to stay where they are. This is a small lockdown. It is just a matter of six days. If you leave, you’ll waste your time, energy and money in going and coming back only. I am there for you. We will take good care of you all. Please do not leave the city. I am hoping we will not need to extend this lockdown any further if all of you operate with us,” he said. Senior officials in the L-G office said Baijal has asked officials to strictly address the issue of migrant workers who might start congregating at transit points across the city to once again leave for their home states. The order issued by chief secretary Vijay Dev on behalf of the Delhi disaster management authority (DDMA) stated: “The situation of Covid-19 in NCT of Delhi has again been reviewed and it has been observed that there has been a very sharp increase in Covid-19 cases along with very high positivity rate over the last few days and therefore, it is felt that in order to contain the fast spread of the virus, a curfew needs to be imposed in the territory of NCT of Delhi, except for essential activities/services, as an emergency measure, in order to break the transmission chain of Covid-19 virus and for the overall well being and safety of the people of Delhi.” The order stated that all offices -- Delhi government and the private ones -- except those falling under the exempted category (essential services) will remain shut during the six-day lockdown.Also Read | Farmers’ protest: Traffic remains diverted at several Delhi borders“Except for those exempted/allowed movements and activities, all other private offices/establishments, shops, shopping centres, malls, weekly markets, manufacturing units, educational and coaching institutes, cinema and theatres, restaurant and bars, auditoriums/assembly halls, entertainment/amusement/water parks, public parks and gardens, sports complexes, gyms, spas, barber shops, saloons, beauty parlours, swimming pools (except being used for training of sports persons for national or international events), construction activities (except where labourer are residing on site), etc., shall remain closed during the curfew,” read the order. Central government and judicial officials, diplomats, journalists and doctors will be allowed to travel during the lockdown on production of a valid identity card. People coming from or going to airports, railway stations or interstate bus terminals will be allowed on production of a valid ticket. But all other workers -- grocery shop staff, internet workers, bank staff, delivery personnel, petrol pump workers, private security staff, among others -- and the staff operating religious places in the city will need to show a valid curfew pass to be allowed to travel. The order clarifies that religious places will remain open but no visitors will be allowed. Marriages with 50 people will be permitted by showing wedding cards and funerals with 20 persons. Liquor shops will be shut.Although the order does not specifically mention domestic helpers, it is advised that they are asked to not come if they live in far-off places as they might be prosecuted by the police. People going for Covid-19 testing or vaccination will be allowed to travel with valid ID cards. People feeling sick or going for scheduled medical treatment will be able to travel on presenting a valid ID card or medical papers or a doctor’s prescription.The DDMA reiterated that public transport will be allowed only for those engaged in essential services. The order also imposed fresh restrictions on the passenger capacity in other modes of public transport such as auto-rickshaws and cabs. Auto-rickshaws, e-rickshaws, taxis, gramin sewa and phat phat sewa will be allowed only with two passengers in each such vehicle. Five passengers will be allowed in maxi cabs and RTVs will be allowed to carry up to 11 passengers. The Delhi Metro and state-run buses are already running at 50% of their capacity with no standing passengers allowed. Officials in the L-G office said Baijal has also reached out to Union health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan for enhancing beds in the capital city, and Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath with regard to getting more oxygen supply for Delhi.In his press conference, Kejriwal also mentioned the shortage of beds, oxygen supply and life saving drugs such remdesivir. “We have been honest and transparent while sharing Covid data with the public. We didn’t reduce tests. In fact, we have been consistent with our daily testing numbers because of which globally, hardly any city has such high tests per million as Delhi. Other states are reducing tests to reduce daily numbers. But, given the pace of the Covid surge, now we have started facing shortages. I have always been against a lockdown because it does not stop Covid, it only arrests its speed, but we will have to impose it now. So, please follow the lockdown,” he said. Resident Welfare Associations (RWAs) welcomed the move but said the curbs should have been imposed earlier. BS Vohra, president of east Delhi RWAs joint front said the restrictions have been imposed when the city’s health infrastructure has collapsed. “Since the past 15 to 20 days, we have been demanding a complete lockdown in Delhi as we had sensed trouble when numbers started rising from March-end. Now, things have been delayed to such an extent that the entire system has collapsed with no beds, no ventilators, no oxygen, no medicines all over the city. The Delhi government must take extra caution on the issues which may lead to huge mortalities. It must act on a war footing to save precious human lives. RWAs of Delhi will support the government in every possible manner,” he said. On Sunday, several trader groups pitched for voluntary closing of markets and resident groups demanded a short lockdown to arrest the surge in cases and break the chain of transmission.The Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) said the lockdown was a “much-needed” step. “The CAIT was continuously demanding a lockdown in Delhi in the wake of the rapidly increasing Covid cases. We have urged the L-G and the CM to nominate five nodal officers dividing Delhi into five zones namely, central, east, west, north and south Delhi to collaborate with CAIT team leaders for ensuring smooth passage of supply of essential goods to Delhi people. According to our estimate, each day there will be a business loss of about ₹600 crore per day in Delhi during the curfew,” said Praveen Khandelwal, secretary general, CAIT.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-to-impose-week-long-curfew-from-tonight-101618813410643.html

In view of sharply increasing cases, Del needs much more than normal supply. Rather than increasing supply, our normal supply has been sharply reduced and Delhi's quota has been diverted to other states. OXYGEN HAS BECOME AN EMERGENCY IN DEL," he later tweeted.

Last week, the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) cancelled Class 10 exams and delayed Class 12 board exams in the wake of the second nationwide Covid-19 wave.Schools that will remain closed include Bal Bharati Public School in Rohini, Mount Abu Public School, The Indian School, Apeejay School, and Birla Vidya Niketan. Several private schools said that most of the teachers were not coming to school as learning has moved online and it was mostly the administrative staff that was present on the premises.Bal Bharati principal Geeta Gangwani said, “Teaching has gone completely online, so teachers weren’t coming to school. But administrative staff including the accounts department and support staff were coming to school for planning the current academic session. This will now be moved online. Only a section of the school will be open with strict protocols in the coming week with a handful of staff,” she said.Jyoti Arora, principal, Mount Abu Public School, said all teaching staff was told to work from home mode last week. “We have shifted entire staff, except security, to work from home till further notification from the school,” she said.The move comes on a day when government school teachers’ association (GSTA) has also written to deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia calling for the complete closure of schools. Ajay Veer Yadav, general secretary of the association said that in the wake of CBSE cancelling Class 10 exams and delaying Class 12 exams, the physical presence of teachers in the school was not necessary.On April 11, Sisodia said that school principals and the staff can decide among themselves on how many teachers will come to school and how many will give lessons online.“We have been getting reports of numerous teachers testing positive for Covid in schools and the heads of schools are calling them for duty. Such orders have put the entire school staff at a high risk of exposure,” Yadav wrote in his letter to Sisodia. Hundreds of government school teachers have been deployed for Covid-19 duties across the capital for enforcing Covid-19 protocols at airports, banquet halls, helping the district administration.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/100-private-schools-to-shut-most-staff-to-wfh-101618798277423.html

But, on the contrary, a large proportion of patients are showing major symptoms and require hospitalisation and other such treatment protocols...Remdesivir is a vital medicine in the treatment protocol of a Covid-19 case. Unfortunately, there is an acute scarcity of the medicine in Jharkhand," read the letter.The letter further said that the supply from Indian manufacturers fell short of the growing demand for the drug which led it to explore the international market for the medicine."Since we could not get the Remdesivir as per our requirement from Indian manufacturers, we started exploring the international market for procuring Remdesivir. We have been able to get a quotation from Bangladesh's Beximo pharmaceuticals for 50,000 vials of the drug which the Jharkhand government is willing to procure at the earliest in light of the pressing needs of the medicine," the letter added."In view of the above, I would request you to allow us to import and use the medicine from the said company," the letter concluded.Earlier on Saturday, Soren urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to direct the Ministry of Home Affairs and Ministry of Defence to issue necessary instructions for permitting the state government to deploy doctors and paramedics of the CPMFs and Military Hospitals for the treatment and management of Covid-19 patients.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/jharkhand-seeks-centre-s-nod-to-import-remdesivir-vials-from-bangladesh-101618796766740.html
19-04-2021||Delhi||CM flags Delhi’s ‘oxygen emergency’, writes to Centre||Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday called the shortage of oxygen for Covid-19 patients in Delhi an “emergency”, as his deputy Manish Sisodia identified hospitals that would run out of oxygen within hours if supply was not augmented.“Del facing acute shortage of oxygen. In view of sharply increasing cases, Del needs much more than normal supply. Rather than increasing supply, our normal supply has been sharply reduced and Delhi’s quota has been diverted to other states. OXYGEN HAS BECOME AN EMERGENCY IN DEL,” Kejriwal tweeted, after a meeting on the scarcity Sunday evening.Several resident welfare groups and relatives of Covid-19 patients on Sunday also said they were facing trouble getting oxygen cylinders and concentrators.Kejriwal also wrote to Union minister of commerce and industries Piyush Goyal on Sunday, seeking his intervention into the matter, and highlighted that the Centre was sending oxygen to other states through a company that was a “major supplier” in Delhi.In his letter, a copy of which HT has seen, Kejriwal said, “National Capital Territory of Delhi has witnessed a very sharp increase in Covid-19 cases leading to a very large number of serious patients getting admitted to various private and government hospitals. This has led to a huge jump in demand for medical oxygen. On the basis of the standard formula prescribed by the government of India, a minimum requirement of 700MT of oxygen has been projected to your ministry. The same was communicated to the Secretary of Government of India department of promotion of industry and internal trade, ministry of commerce and industry, government of India, vide letter dated April 17. A quick response in the matter is still awaited.”Also read: In two days, 49 Kumbh returnees test Covid-19 positive in GujaratThe chief minister also said that the outputs of M/S Inox, a “major supplier” in the Capital, were largely being diverted to other states.“At this critical juncture it will not be possible for hospitals to enter contractual agreements with the new suppliers who have now been assigned to Delhi. This disruption is already starting to cause critical shortage across major hospitals,” the letter read.The company accounts for 20% of Delhi’s total daily oxygen supply.A spokesperson of the Union commerce ministry did not respond to HT’s queries related to Kejriwal’s letter.“After a discussion with states, the government has finalised the distribution of 6,177 metric tonnes of oxygen, including 1,500 MT to Maharashtra, 350 MT to Delhi and 800 MT to Uttar Pradesh,” a government official with direct knowledge of the matter said, requesting anonymity.During an inspection at a Covid-19 facility, Sisodia said, “Several hospitals in Delhi are facing major oxygen shortages. Some of them will run out of oxygen in another three or four hours, while several will run out in 10-12 hours if supply is not enhanced immediately. I have done a review this evening. For instance, Batra Hospital has oxygen for three hours, Balaji Hospital for 24 hours, while Ganga Ram Hospital has supply for 32 hours. It is a critical situation. We have urged the Centre to make oxygen supply a priority.”Meanwhile, residents said vendors had run out of new cylinders, even as hospitals turned patients away due to a shortage of beds.Puneeta Marwah, a resident of Greater Kailash 1, said, “It has been a struggle to arrange for oxygen cylinders or concentrators. A few hospitals told us a few beds may free up in a day or two. But till then, we have to manage the patient at home.”The GK-1 resident welfare association (RWA) stepped in, providing her with an oxygen concentrator. The association has maintained two oxygen concentrators and three cylinders since last year for Covid-19 patients.Health experts recommend that Covid-19 patients get hospitalised if their oxygen saturation is below 94mm. However, with facilities packed, experts say patients should be given oxygen therapy at home if possible.Dr Vikas Maurya, director and head of pulmonology, Fortis Healthcare, Shalimar Bagh, said, “Given the surge in Covid-19 cases and demand for hospital beds, it is advisable for patients to take oxygen therapy or support at home till they get admission in hospital. Oxygen saturation below 94 means that there is lung involvement and patients should start looking to get hospitalised. A level below 90 is a cause of concern.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/cm-flags-delhi-s-oxygen-emergency-writes-to-centre-101618796215488.html
19-04-2021||Delhi||Kumbh pilgrims told to isolate for 14 days on return||The Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) on Saturday asked those returning from the Kumbh Mela at Haridwar and those who intend to go there in the coming days to mandatorily upload their details on the Delhi government website and undergo 14-day home or institutional quarantine after returning to the Capital.In an order issued later by chief secretary Vijay Dev on Saturday night, the DDMA also asked Delhi residents, who had visited the ongoing Kumbh Mela between April 4 and Saturday, to upload their details compulsorily by Sunday midnight. The details include name of the returnee, address in Delhi, contact number, ID proof, date of departure from Delhi and arrival in Delhi, among others.“All those residents of Delhi, who have visited or are going to visit Kumbh, will be required to compulsory home quarantine themselves for 14 days on arrival to Delhi. If it is found/reported that any such resident of Delhi, who has returned to Delhi after visiting Kumbh, has not uploaded the requisite details/information, he/she will be sent to an institutional government quarantine centre for 14 days by the district magistrate (DM) concerned,” read the order.At least 2,000 devotees have tested Covid-19 positive at Kumbh in around a week’s time.The Delhi government has no data on the number of residents who went to attend the Kumbh Mela this year, senior government officials said.“It is true that such a portal should have been created earlier, preferably before the Kumbh Mela started on March 11 or from April 1 when the cases started rising in Delhi. We hope all such people will now fill in their details at the earliest so that districts can launch surveillance on them. On March 17, when the Kumbh had started, DDMA had issued a general advisory urging people to monitor their health and do an RT-PCR test upon their return to Delhi. The advisory, however, did not say that it was mandatory for the returnees,” said an official on condition of anonymity.Dr Lalit Kant, former head of the department of epidemiology at the Indian Council of Medical Research, however, said the damage has already been done. “Weeks have passed since day one of the Maha Kumbh and thousands must have already returned to Delhi. Those who visited in the first few days would have finished their quarantine by now had this been planned before. Now, people who returned in the past 14 days will have to be traced and tracked and there is no guarantee that everyone who went there will actually fill the forms. All of the returnees are moving freely, some of who may even have Covid-19,” he said.A revenue official in one of the 11 districts said it will be nearly impossible for the administration to identify or locate those who returned from the Kumbh, without the pilgrims themselves declaring their details on the government portal. “There are chances that we can track those Delhi visitors who registered in the Uttarakhand government portal. But, it is unlikely many did that,” said the revenue official on condition of anonymity.The order further asked all DMs to ensure all such residents are traced and kept under surveillance on a daily basis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/kumbh-pilgrims-told-to-isolate-for-14-days-on-return-101618792510048.html

Alleging that the varsity officials are not even following Covid-19 protocols while calling them to campus for semester exams, the students said that this is putting their lives, and that of their families, at risk. They added that four students –two of the law department and two of the tourism department – and some faculty members have already tested positive for Covid-19 but the authorities don’t seem to care.“Every other university is conducting online exams. Only Central University of Kashmir is forcing its students to come to campus for exams. Jammu Central University has also postponed the exams even though Jammu has fewer cases than Kashmir,” said a student of the M.Tech department. He added, “The varsity doesn’t seem to care that students may get infected. All students are seated in the same class and we suspect that some Covid-positive student may also be appearing for the exams.” A law student said that despite two students from their department testing positive, the varsity authorities did not follow standard operating procedures. “There is neither proper screening nor sanitisation in the university. Even when there were positive cases, no sanitisation was done in the department,” she said.‘When we protested, they threatened us’Students said they had staged a protest on the campus on April 15, demanding the exams to be postponed. “But the teachers threatened us that we will face a backlog and we will be failed,” said a student. “The officials don’t care about the lives of students, nor do they care about the lives of the students’ families. What they want is to claim credit in front of NEET officials that they conducted exams amid the pandemic,” she said.Don’t have foolproof mechanism for online exam: V-CVice-chancellor (V-C) Mehraj Uddin Mir acknowledged the risk in conducting the exams amid Covid-19 but said the varsity is following all protocols. He said he had taken on board all class representatives before conducting the exams. “There is a risk and I have taken this risk after taking some precautions. I am monitoring the situation closely and in case I feel it is going to create an issue, I will postpone the exams immediately,” said Mir.He added that proper distancing and sanitisation was being done while conducting exams. “When four of our students and some faculty members tested positive, we followed proper norms, and sent them into isolation and suspended class work,” he said.When asked why the varsity was not switching to online examination, the V-C said, “We don’t have a fool proof mechanism for online examinations. Our teaching-learning has not been tailored to online examination. That is why we conduct exams in small groups,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/central-university-of-kashmir-students-want-semester-exams-postponed-101618779268378.html

Before the resurgence in cases, trains on the track were running at full capacity, especially the special vista dome coaches, which were launched in 2019 and are a major tourist draw. Shimla railway station superintendent Prince Sethi said, “The trains were almost running to full capacity but now only 30% passengers are boarding the train. There have been no bookings for the vista dome coaches.” The new rail coaches have a toughened glass roof top, which enables passengers to have a broader view of their surroundings. The new rail car is fitted with night-vision closed-circuit cameras with LED screens, modern toilets, air conditioning and an infotainment system. The Shimla narrow-gauge rail line was constructed by the British in 1903 to connect the subcontinent with its summer capital, Shimla. The track is a UNESCO heritage site and five trains run on the track per day. After the outbreak, rail services had been suspended and had only resumed in December after 10 months. Tourism industry hit Amid the spike in cases, a slew of restrictions are being announced one after the other, bringing the tourism industry to a grinding halt in Himachal. “The financial health of the tourism industry is already in a shambles as all tourism units had remained closed for seven to eight months last year. The industry was slowly reviving when there was a resurgence in cases and restrictions were reimposed,”said MK Seth, president, Himachal Pradesh Tourism Stakeholder Association . “The stakeholders were at least getting some revenue to meet their expenses but the second wave of infections has broken the backbone of the tourism industry in Himachal,” he said.Earlier, the government had announced that people coming from seven high caseload states — Punjab, Delhi, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Karnataka, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh need to carry a negative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) report not earlier than 72 hours while visiting Himachal Pradesh from April 16.Hoteliers demand concessions The state traditionally receives heavy tourist rush from mid-March to mid-July, of which tourists from Gujarat and Maharasthra form the major chunk. “It has become difficult for stakeholders to keep their units running due to shortage of funds. All advance bookings are being cancelled. The recent advisory issued by the state government, making it mandatory for tourists coming from seven high caseload states to bring a negative Covid report, has completely stopped the influx of tourists,” Seth said. Hoteliers have demanded that the government subsidise tariff on water, property tax, and garbage fee for two years . It has further sought abolishment of demand charges and other fee charged from the hotel industry and demanded 75% concession on bar fee to save the ailing tourism industry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/amid-covid-surge-kalka-shimla-heritage-track-sees-70-drop-in-passenger-traffic-101618777948335.html

19-04-2021||Delhi||Patients line up outside Lok Nayak Hospital amid relentless case surge||On the road where only one-way traffic is permitted, an ambulance zooms past the flow of traffic to make it to the main gate of the Lok Nayak Hospital. The security guard signals the ambulance to stop, but lets it in moments later.It was a matter of life and death for the Covid-19 positive patient inside -- the reason why the guard did not insist that the ambulance come in by another gate marked for Covid-19 patients. “The driver said the patient’s oxygen level was critically low,” the guard explained.On Sunday afternoon, there was no long queue of ambulances outside the hospital -- unlike Saturday night -- but each coronavirus patient and their family arriving at the hospital had a story to tell.As the Covid-19 cases zoomed past the 25,000 mark in Delhi on Sunday, social media was abuzz with requests for help in arranging beds, plasma donors, medicines and oxygen supply.On Saturday night, a video shared on Twitter by a journalist, showed that a patient in one of the several ambulances queued up outside the hospital, died even before entry into the hospital. Another photo shared on Twitter showed a patient sitting outside the hospital with an oxygen mask and cylinder.Lok Nayak is the Delhi government’s biggest dedicated Covid facility, with 1,620 beds. As of 5.30pm on Sunday, the Delhi Corona app showed, only 184 of these beds were vacant. Meanwhile, not one of the 350 ICU beds was available.One patient, whose family identified him just as Prasad, a resident of south Delhi’s Kalkaji, made frantic phone calls despite lying in an ambulance with an oxygen mask around his face. “He knows people who could arrange plasma and other things. We don’t know who to approach,” said a woman accompanying him.Also Read | Govt bans oxygen supply to industries amid massive shortageAnother young man, Saajan Prakash, stood outside the hospital and opened a fresh Twitter account. “I am just being ready in case we need to seek any help,” said Prakash whose uncle is hospitalised.There was another patient who arrived with five relatives -- that included four women -- accompanying him in an ambulance.“Only he is infected, but we have arrived to offer support,” said one of those relatives.A few patients arrived in private cars and one even in an auto-rickshaw. The relative of one such patient was wearing a PPE suit and put up a plastic partition in the car to keep him separate. “I am his uncle. One of us needs to be safe,” said the man behind the wheel, about the protection.Suresh Kumar, director of Lok Nayak Hospital, advised relatives of patients to check the government’s app for available beds before rushing to a hospital. “Our hospital does not have any empty ICU beds now. I advise that patients be taken to other hospitals to save time,” he said.Ambulance drivers outside the hospital said in the last few days there is a queue every evening. “We don’t know why the rush occurs in the evening and night, but the queue extended for several hundred metres on Saturday night,” said Rajdeep Singh, an ambulance driver.A bunch of other ambulance drivers waited outside the hospital for the hours to roll by. “When the wait gets long, we offer the patients the option to avail beds at other hospitals. That is the service we are currently providing,” said Asif Ali, an ambulance driver.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/patients-line-up-outside-lok-nayak-hospital-amid-relentless-case-surge-101618776442870.html

This has given the agriculture experts a hope to boost crop diversification in the state. The government had set the MSP for the rabi crop at ₹4,650. Only private players buy mustard in the state as the government is not involved in procurement of the crop. The farmers said this is the second consecutive season when mustard rates crossed the MSP. Arvind Setia, who had sown the crop on 10 acres at Toota Wali village in Abohar, the main trading centre of mustard in Punjab, has decided to delay the sale of his produce. “In the last season, private players were offering from ₹3,300 to ₹3,500 per quintal but gradually mustard rates touched ₹4,500 against the MSP of ₹4,425. I have not seen such a demand for mustard in the market in the past 25 years. The buyers are procuring every kilo arriving in the mandis,” said Setia. It costs nearly ₹5,000 to sow mustard on 1 acre and a farmer can harvest a minimum of 7 quintals from it weather and other factors remain favourable. “As per the existing rates, I will earn ₹40,000 from an acre and unlike wheat, mustard requires a negligible amount of water and pesticides,” added Setia. Baldev Singh, a progressive farmer from Bajak in Bathinda district, said mustard has the potential to change Punjab’s farm economy that is under stress due to depleting groundwater levels. “It is less-labour intensive than wheat. A comprehensive plan to promote oilseeds will encourage farmers to shift towards mustard and the current market trend is very encouraging,” he added. State agriculture director Dr Sukhdev Sidhu said mustard was grown on nearly 36,000 hectares in the state this time. Sidhu said Markfed can play an important role in venturing into mustard oil processing to encourage farmers to diversify towards oilseeds. “We aim to increase the area under the crop also but traditionally it is restricted to southern Punjab. The rabi oilseed has immense scope in the kandi belt and other parts of the state. In the early 1990s, more than 1.50 lakh hectares was under mustard cultivation. But with the strengthening of the irrigation system three decades ago, the farmers switched from traditional mustard farming to wheat,” said Sidhu. Rakesh Rathi, a trader and mustard miller, said high global prices have made edible oil imports dearer, benefiting domestic mustard growers when their crop is being brought to the mandis. “Mustard oil is the cheapest cooking oil and its demand has seen a surge after Covid-19 outbreak last year. The traditional edible oil has growing acceptance among consumers as it is the only edible oil after olive oil with no chemicals use during entire processing,” said Rathi. He said mustard has also seen a demand in the vegetable oil manufacturing sector for authorised blending. “The government should promote the cotton-mustard combination in the Malwa region and elsewhere to get out of wheat-paddy cycle for water conservation. It can be a game changer for farmers and mustard seeds have a huge market,” said Rathi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/mustard-prices-at-all-time-high-in-punjab-experts-hope-for-big-diversification-push-101618775609899.html

This is the first case registered in April. In March too, just a couple of cases were registered. The First Information Report (FIR) has been registered on the complaint of sub-inspector (SI) Balraj Singh. “We got a tip-off that one Amit Kuswah has been selling Pani Puri at his shop due to which a crowd had gathered with no one wearing a mask,” the SI’s complaint reads. Amit was arrested, but was given bail. He has been booked under Section 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) of the IPC. Police, however, have turned a blind eye to no masks being used at politicians’ rallies or elections. On Thursday, elections were held for electing presidents of the Jandiala municipal council and Rayya Nagar Panchayat. Both towns fall under rural district’s jurisdictions and in the town, over a 100 person had gathered, with no social distancing. Only few wore masks and pictures of these events were posted on social media. The pictures are in contrast to the assertion of DSP Sukhwinderpal Singh, who was present in the Jandiala event. He said, “Social distancing norms were followed and everyone was provided with masks at the event.” Even as rallies are proving to be a huge headache, farmers have also been holding rallies and functions despite the administration’s ban. On Sunday, Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee held a Maharally in Bhagtanwala grain market, where thousands of farmers had gathered.Gate Hakima SHO Ranjit Singh, under whose jurisdiction farmers had held the rally said, “I have no instruction to register any case for violation of covid-19 norms during farmers’ rally.” A spokesperson in Amritsar-rural police refuted any allegations of bias and said they had distributed over 4,000 masks to public on Friday. .ELDERLY BARNALA COUPLE HONOURED FOR GETTING THE JABBarnala Surjit Kaur, 96, and Krishan Singh, 92, of Barnala, got their first shot of the covid vaccine during a camp at the MC office of the town on Sunday.

The protesters, including women and youths, have been staging sit-ins at railway station parking lots, toll plazas and in front of the residences of Punjab Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders and premises of corporate houses. Women are participating in large numbers in the protests in the state as men are holding an indefinite protest at the Delhi border under the banner of the Samyukta Kisan Morcha, an umbrella body of over 30 farmer unions, and the Bhartiya Kisan Union (Ekta-Ugrahan) besides being busy in harvesting of wheat back home. The protests in Punjab are witnessing large gatherings, especially between 12 noon to 3pm. “The summer has arrived but the Narendra Modi government is still not ready to listen to the farmers’ grievances. We have decided to continue the agitation till the three black laws are repealed,” said Jaspal Kaur (60) of Karamgarh village in Barnala district. Balwant Singh Upli, a protester in Barnala, said, “The government has failed to dampen the spirits of farmers even after 200 days. We faced bone-chilling winter, rain and storm during the stir. The farmers are ready to face summer at the protest sites. The government wants to get the protest sites vacated in the name of the coronavirus. But the farmers are fighting a battle of survival and are ready to sacrifice their lives” Narain Dutt, another protester, said the union leaders are holding meetings with farmers at the grain markets during the ongoing procurement to prepare for a massive protest in the second week of May. BKU (Ekta-Ugrahan) Sangrur block chief Gobinder Singh said the farmers have been staging protests at toll plazas and Reliance-owned petrol pumps since October 1. “A large procession of farmers will move to the Delhi border on April 21 via the Khanauri border in Sangrur.

Also, the protesters did not adhere to Covid-19 protocol of maintaining social distancing. Addressing the gathering, committee’s state general secretary Sarwan Singh Pandher said, “The Modi government is planning to remove the protesters from the Delhi borders on the pretext of containing the pandemic. The farmers and labourers protesting there will not let the Centre succeed in its plan as it has endangered the future of our coming generations by selling out our interests to some corporate houses, World Trade Organization (WTO), World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF).” The farmer leaders also raised concern over tardy lifting of wheat from the mandis. Hardeep Singh Dibdiba, whose grandson Navreet Singh died during a tractor parade taken out by the protesting farmers in the national capital on January 26, also addressed the gathering. Committee’s state vice president Sawinder Singh Chutala said, “The Punjab government should ensure quick lifting of grain or we will stage protests. If the farmers are harassed in grain markets, effigies of Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh and PM Narendra Modi will be burnt at villages from April 21 to 25. Also, the government must compensate the farmers whose crop was damaged by hailstorm and rain.” A jatha of thousands of farmers will leave Amritsar for the Kundli border in Delhi to intensify the stir against the farm laws on May 5, the farm leaders announced.A large number of women participated in the rally.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/covid-norms-go-for-a-toss-as-kmsc-holds-mega-rally-in-amritsar-101618775014878.html

The guru’s birthplace is situated in the narrow streets of the walled city area. It is the smell of overflowing sewage and garbage littered outside the shrine that greets the visitors. The Centre and the Punjab government, which are spending lakhs of rupees to mark the fourth centenary, have failed to give the place a facelift. The Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) and the state government will start holding functions on April 29 to mark the birth anniversary that falls on May 1. While the gurdwara body has planned to organise a grand event in Amritsar, the government will hold its event at Anandpur Sahib which was founded by the 9th guru. Since the guru’s birthplace is located close to the Golden Temple, Gurdwara Bhai Salo Jee and other historic gurdwaras in the walled city, the devotees usually visit all the shrines barefoot. On Sunday, the sewerage got choked and the wastewater overflowed into the street that connects Guru Ka Mehal with Gurdwara Bhai Salo Jee inconveniencing the prilgrims.“Despite the upcoming occasion, the municipal corporation has failed to fix the problems of sanitation and sewage overflowing. When we lodge a complaint in this regard, the MC sends workers who only fix the problem temporarily,” said a shopkeeper in the gurdwara’s neighbourhood.Amritsar mayor Karamjit Singh Rintu said, “We have asked the workers to work overtime for lifting of garbage and cleaning during night. The problem will be fixed in a day or two. As far as dilapidated streets are concerned, most of them have been rebuilt. Façade work in these streets has also started. We will visit the area to check any shortcoming.”The SGPC, which manages the gurdwara, has failed to complete the renovation project. “The work will be finished by April 29 as it is going on a war footing,” said Golden Temple manager Gurinder Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/10-days-left-for-400th-birth-anniversary-celebrations-garbage-overflowing-sewage-greet-visitors-at-9th-guru-s-birthplace-101618775011152.html

To date, only ₹22 crore has been disbursed to at least 750 state farmers for procurement that started on April 10. “By Monday, disbursal will begin in full swing as hiccups in implementing the DBT have been removed. At least 18,000 arhtiyas have been linked to the new system. There are 33,000 arhtiyas in Punjab, of which 25,000 are active in procurement,” an officer, who is part of the process, said, adding that the Centre had mandated the system. He added that Mansa, Sangrur, Patiala, Barnala and Bathinda top the chart in disbursal of the Minimum Support Price (MSP), which has been fixed at ₹1,975 per quintal. State procurement agencies are expecting arrival of 130 lakh tonne wheat for procurement. The total production is expected to be 167 lakh tonne.  When the DBT system was introduced, earlier this month, arhtiyas has resisted it and announced a strike. To pacify the arhtiyas, the state government decided to bring changes in the Public Financial Management System (PFMS) so that arhtiyas could have access to a window and clear payment being credited into farmers’ accounts. Food department sources said on Sunday that 50 lakh tonne wheat had arrived in mandis, of which 42 lakh tonne had been procured. This will pick up as wheat harvest begins in Doaba and Majha belts. PROCUREMENT OF HD2967 WHEAT ON: ASHU “The procurement of HD 2967 variety on in an hassle-free manner,” said food and civil supplies minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu, in response to reports that the variety was discoloured and was thus not being purchased in the Malwa belt. “Punjab Agricultural University, Ludhiana, has approved this variety for purchase,” the minister added.  The state government has approved packing of heat used gunny bags that the arhtiyas will provide to tackle shortage. An officer added that arrival had touched 8 lakh tonne daily, accepting shortage of bags for wheat storage.A spokesperson said the CM had reviewed status of procurement. On slow pace in Amritsar, Gurdaspur, Tarn Taran and Ferozepur, he said that the grain was shriveled and the Centre needed to relax procurement norms before purchase. The state has written to the Centre’s food and PDS ministry to seek immediate relaxation for wheat procurement for shriveled and broken grains up to 11% and lustre loss up to 10% in Amritsar, Tarn Taran and Fazilka without value cut.In a joint analysis of wheat samples in FCI district Amritsar (Revenue District Amritsar and Tarn Taran) conducted by FCI and the state procurement agencies, lustre loss up to 5% and shriveled and broken grains up to 11% have been found in a few mandis. In Fazilka, the percentage of shriveled and broken grains is up to 9.9%, which is in excess of the 6% ceiling. Chief secretary Vini Mahajan has informed the CM that covid protocols would be followed in all mandis and special vaccination camps had been set up.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/direct-payment-to-farmers-to-get-going-with-rs-350-cr-transfer-today-claims-govt-101618774469002.html

We are far too many tragedies, too late, in doing so.”Kiran Deol, who attended the vigil in support of family members affected by the shooting, said loopholes in the law that make it easier for individuals to buy guns “need to be closed now,” and emphasised that anyone who tries to buy a firearm should be required to have their background checked.Satjeet Kaur, the Sikh Coalition’s executive director, said the entire community was traumatised by the “senseless” violence. “While we don’t yet know the motive of the shooter, he targeted a facility known to be heavily populated by Sikh employees,” Kaur said.There are between 8,000 and 10,000 Sikh Americans in Indiana, according to the coalition One of the victims of Thursday night’s shooting was Amarjit Sekhon, a 48-year-old Sikh mother of two sons, who was the breadwinner of her family. Kuldip Sekhon said his sister-in-law began working at the FedEx facility in November and was a dedicated worker whose husband was disabled.In addition to Sekhon, the Marion County Coroner’s office identified the dead as: Matthew R. Alexander, 32; Samaria Blackwell, 19; Amarjeet Johal, 66; Jasvinder Kaur, 50; Jaswinder Singh, 68; Karli Smith, 19; and John Weisert, 74.Kuldip Sekhon said his family lost another relative in the shooting — Kaur, who was his son’s mother-in-law. He said both Kaur and Amarjit Sekhon both began working at the FedEx facility last year.Komal Chohan, who said Amarjeet Johal was her grandmother, said in a statement issued by the Sikh Coalition that her family members, including several who work at the FedEx warehouse, are “traumatised” by the killings.The shooting is the deadliest incident of violence collectively in the Sikh community in the U.S. since 2012, when a white supremacist burst into a Sikh temple in Wisconsin and shot 10 people, killing seven.United Sikhs, a United Nations affiliated human rights and advocacy organisation, has expressed shock over the shooting. “We are in touch with the federal agencies for the safety and security of people at all these community events,” said Manvinder Singh, director of the United Sikhs. Singh demanded from the Joe Biden administration to swiftly act against the hate crimes and develop a mechanism to stop it. ‘Probe shooting as potential hate crime’Influential American lawmakers and Sikh community leaders have sought a thorough investigation into the mass shooting at the FedEx facility, according to a PTI report.Indian-American Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi said: “While the Indianapolis and Sikh communities continue to mourn, and as the rest of our country mourns with them, investigators must also determine if this mass shooting was a hate-motivated attack in addition to serving as another example of the plague of gun violence which has beset our nation,” Krishnamoorthi said.“We do not yet know the motive of the shooter, and we may never know for sure what drove him to do what he did. We do know, however, that the FedEx facility he targeted was known for having a large workforce,” said a joint statement issued by eight gurdwaras of Indianapolis.Shooter’s family apologises to victims’ relatives The family of the 19-year-old mass shooter in Indiana who killed eight people, including four Sikhs, has apologised to the relatives of the victims, saying they were “devastated” by the actions of their son and that they tried to get him the help he needed.The gunman, identified as Brandon Scott Hole, shot and killed himself after opening fire at the FedEx Ground Facility in Indianapolis on Thursday night. He was a former FedEx employee.Hole’s family released a statement to the families of the victims and the Indianapolis community on Saturday.“We are devastated at the loss of life caused as a result of Brandon’s actions; through the love of his family, we tried to get him the help he needed. “Our sincerest and most heartfelt apologies go out to the victims of this senseless tragedy.

Farmers alleged that police used force to disperse them.A group of protesters, including women, arrived at around 2pm carrying black flags and tried to reach the venue. The police, however, kept them in check for some time. Later, protesters who managed to enter the venue burnt BJP flags and raised slogans against the party. Hisar police spokesperson Vikash Lohachab said that the police detained some protesters, including women, near the venue and released them later.“The police had to use mild force while controlling the protesters who were kept at some distance from the venue,” he said. Kisan Sabha leader Shamsher Nambardar said, “It is surprising that at a time when the Covid cases are growing alarmingly, the BJP is organising events in such congestedplaces.” Hundreds of farmers staged a protest for the second consecutive day as BJP MP Nayab Saini visited Kurukshetra on Sunday, forcing the police to use mild force and take around 70 protestors into custody. The Kurukshetra MP was to attend a programme on Ambedkar Jayanti. Police personnel had to struggle to control the farmers when they reached close to the venue and tried to cross the barricades. Later, the police detained 70 farmers and took them to Police Lines.Kurukshetra assistant superintendent of police (ASP) Ravinder Tomar said farmers had been permitted to protest in the theme park but they tried to cross the barricades and disrupted law and order. Farmers alleged that Saini was deliberately holding such programmes to divide the people and disrupt peace. Saini accused the Congress of instigating protests against the ruling parties. “This should be called Congress’ protest not farmers’ protest as some people are using the farmers’ cause as a front to work against their welfare,” he said.Amid heavy police deployment, education minister Kanwar Pal Gurjar reached Karnal to attend the Ambedkar Jayanti programme. “We are open for any discussion in the Rajya Sabha and Lok Sabha to clear farmers’ doubts,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/farmers-stage-protest-against-bjp-leaders-in-hisar-101618773928297.html

19-04-2021||Mumbai||Cost structure, adequate funding needed for regional airlines: Experts||In early January, a pilot-turned-entrepreneur commenced a new airline in a segment which has seen only failures in the country’s aviation space because of myriad reasons. Consider this, between 2011 and 2018, as many as five private regional airlines –Air Mantra, Air Costa, Air Pegasus, Air Carnival and Air Odisha—started services promising to change the regional aviation landscape in the country, but today, in a span of almost eight years, none of them can be seen flying in the skies, as all have shut shop. At present there are seven carriers, including disinvestment-bound Air India’s regional arm Alliance Air, operating in the country under regional flying permit.While the future of the most established player in the lot —Alliance Air —looks stable considering it has a strong parent (promoter) in the form of Government of India, concerns regarding the longevity of the remaining privately-funded airlines to sustain operations will depend on a number of factors, as viability of a regional carrier has always been under question.Reason for failuresAviation research and consultancy firm Centre for Asia Pacific Aviation (CAPA), during a webinar on “reinventing regional aviation” had noted that despite undoubted potential of regional aviation in the country, the sector continues to be severely under penetrated, with the market delivering a string of failed regional airlines. Enhancing regional connectivity through fiscal support for a fixed period and infrastructure development is one of the objectives of the National Civil Aviation Policy (NCAP) that the Central government had announced during its first term in 2016.According to Alliance Air’s former chief executive officer (CEO) KS Subbiah, regional airlines are an absolute necessity but they are failing due to inadequate hub networks as point-to-point travel is not enough.The government had in its 2016 policy introduced a new category of airlines — scheduled commuter airline with low capitalisation threshold, and also allowed airlines operating on regional routes under its Udey Desh Ka Aam Nagrik (UDAN) scheme to form codeshare partnerships with the carriers operating on major routes to make regional airlines somewhat viable. But the entry of the established domestic airlines in the play has nullified that possibility.Ratings agency ICRA said the concept of codeshare of regional airlines seems to have not worked as it has not seen codesharing on domestic routes.Citing inadequate capital to fund operations in the long-term as another reason for the failure of regional carriers, Subbiah said, “The promoters must be ready to step in [to capitalise the airline] during crises like Covid-19 or fuel price hike, among others.” CAPA too said regional carriers were succumbing to factors like under-capitalisation, sub-scale operations, mixed fleet of aircraft and demand risks.The major reason for the failure of these regional airlines is unsustainable cost structure, said Kinjal Shah, vice-president of ICRA.“Fuel cost accounts for 30-40% of the total cost of airlines. While this cost on a per kilo litre basis is the same across airlines (full-service carrier or low-cost or regional airline), considering the target audience for regional airlines, air fares have to be kept much lower so as to attract more passengers for maintaining adequate passenger load factors (PLFs),” Shah said.She also pointed out that there is hardly any difference in the airport, landing and navigation charges across big airports and regional airports in India. “This, thus, results in higher cost per available seat kilometre for regional airlines, while their revenue per available seat kilometre is also lower,” Shah pointed.Aid from governmentUnder the Regional Connectivity Scheme (RCS), the aviation ministry has been providing subsidies and viability gap funding to help bridge this gap. Airlines selected under the scheme have to offer lower fares for 50% of their total aircraft seats, for which they receive a subsidy or viability gap funding from the Centre and the state government concerned.Shah said RCS provides a good opportunity for regional airlines to stabilise their troubled operations using the fiscal support being provided. “The subsidy or viability gap funding was valid only for three years. Apart from three-year exclusivity, the question is what will be the government’s support after that period gets over for a long-term commitment and survival? This is important as many routes are becoming unviable after the three-year support is withdrawn, leading to closure of the airline,” said Subbiah.According to Shah, the airlines have also allegedly resorted to ‘lower pricing’ to maintain their PLFs in an environment of increasing capacities, which has resulted in overall deterioration in industry economics and financial stress. Since air fares on regional routes have to be lower to compete with alternate modes of transport, the cost structure for regional airlines also needs to be lower than that of the national airlines, she added.The Indian aviation industry is characterised by high fixed costs, with 35-42% of the airlines’ expenses being fixed in nature.“Since a substantial portion of air travel, both business and leisure, is discretionary, the airline industry tends to experience high volatility in passenger traffic/load factors and consequently adverse financial performance during economic downturns. Thus, airlines need a strong balance sheet to sustain operations,” ICRA stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/cost-structure-adequate-funding-needed-for-regional-airlines-experts-101618773208920.html

The Maharashtra Ekikaran Samiti (EKS), an umbrella organisation created to integrate Marathi-speaking majority districts of Karnataka with Maharashtra, after a long time, has fielded its candidate for the Lok Sabha by-poll in the region. Its candidate Shubham Shelke, 26, a Marathi-speaking youth, is being supported by both Shiv Sena and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP). The by-polls were necessitated after Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) parliamentarian Suresh Angadi died due to Covid-19 last September. Shiv Sena’s Member of Parliament (MP) Sanjay Raut, in his weekly editorial Rok Thok in party mouthpiece Saamana, has praised the Marathi youth in Belgaum for coming together despite all the “hurdles” to preserve Marathi language and culture. “There is a misleading campaign that the current generation is no longer interested in the merger of Belgaum with Maharashtra. In fact, the younger generation has given more power to this 65-year-long struggle,” said Raut, condemning former Maharashtra chief minister and BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis for campaigning against Shelke. Raut warned that if the “atrocities” on the Marathi-speaking population continues, it can have recuperations on Karnataka’s traders. “When Belgaum’s Marathi-speaking people are attacked, our Shiv Sena workers in Kolhapur attack their [Karnataka’s] buses coming into the state. If this trend continues in Mumbai, it will have a bad effect on Karnataka-based traders carrying out their business in Mumbai. However, we are not interested in stretching it to that extent,” he added. Recently, Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray had urged the centre to declare the disputed region as Union Territory, till the Supreme Court gives its final verdict. The border dispute has its origin in the States Reorganisation Act of 1956. The law made Belgaum and 10 talukas of the Bombay state, once part of the colonial Bombay Presidency, a part of the then Mysore state. The Maharashtra government has been demanding that the 800-odd villages in Belgaum and Karwar be included in Maharashtra, as they have a majority of Marathi-speaking population. This dispute is currently before the Supreme Court of India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/fight-for-inclusion-of-disputed-border-areas-of-karnataka-on-shiv-sena-101618773207490.html

The project had in 2015 been accorded forest clearance for 58ha of forest land – a portion of which includes the Sanjay Gandhi National Park – in Maharashtra. A total of 2,267 mangrove trees (in an area of at least 9ha) are set to be cut for DFCCIL ‘s railway-line in Palghar, while 1,196 tivar trees are set to be cut in Thane district over an area of 3ha. The additional area to be diverted consists mostly of mangrove forests. “There are mangrove trees on private and government land at Paye, Payegaon, Chandrapada, Tivri and Shirgaon villages. This area was not included in the original proposal as guidelines for treating mangrove area as deemed forest was not in force. The new guidelines came to force in the year 2017,” DFCCIL wrote to the state forest department in December, referring to a Bombay high court order to bring mangrove forests under the ambit of the Forest Conservation Act (1980). At the time, DFCCIL had sought general permission for cutting the mangrove trees from the forest department. However, the deputy conservator of forest’s office in Thane, in August 2019, advised DFCCIL to initiate a supplementary proposal under the revised guidelines. “So we have accordingly applied for diversion of the additional 13-odd hectares. If our work on site had commenced in 2017 itself, there would have been no impediment,” said Rajeev Tyagi, chief general manager with DFCCIL. The district forest officers of Thane and Dahanu, along with the chief conservator of forests (Thane), have recommended the proposal for clearance. “The proposed project has increased the volume of the rail freight which will help upward economic growth, adding better transport facilities. The proposed project has created large-scale employment and improvement in transportation system, which will help in the fast growth of the economy. The proposed project is a public utility project. Hence, it is recommended, as it is beneficial for public and society,” the forest department noted, before forwarding the proposal to the state government, where it is currently pending, according to two officials in the forest department. One dedicated freight corridor station and major bridges and viaducts fall in these areas, the construction work on which has so far not commenced due to the lack of forest clearance. A total of 28ha in compartment no 687 of the Dhasai forest range (Shahapur division) has been selected for compensatory afforestation, at a cost of ₹2 crore over a 10-year period. Palghar district has 114,803ha of forest area, of which 1,048.6 ha has been diverted across 45 different project proposals since 1980. In Thane, which has 2,062ha of forest area, 8.4ha have been diverted since the same year across 11 different project proposals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/jnptdelhi-railway-track-project-authority-seeks-diversion-of-13ha-of-forest-land-101618773087494.html

19-04-2021||Mumbai||Bombay HC directs cop to buy law books for rural police station||The Aurangabad bench of the Bombay high court (HC) recently directed the station house officer (SHO) of Vasmat Nagar police station in Hingoli district to buy law books pertaining to various crimes for the police station after he was pulled up for not responding to a query by the court in January 2021. The court had sought to know about the action taken by the police on a complaint by a teacher in 2013. The court had initially imposed a fine of ₹10,000 on the officer for dereliction of duty but withdrew the fine. The officer volunteered to contribute ₹2,500 to the court library as a goodwill gesture, following which the court directed him to buy law books for the police station. A division bench of justice Ravindra Ghuge and justice BU Debadwar was hearing a petition filed by a teacher Gopinath Galande seeking directions against the management of a group of schools which had allegedly stopped his salary when he refused to pay a gratification amount for continuation of his services. Advocate KP Rodge told the court that Galande had filed two complaints, one in 2013 and the other in 2017. The complaint in 2013 was against the management after they stopped his salary and asked him to pay ₹15 lakh for continuation of his services and the complaint in 2017 was regarding a lady teacher being employed in two schools of the management at the same time. While the 2013 complaint was dismissed by the police after they did not find any merit in it, a first information report (FIR) was registered against the management in the 2017 complaint for having the same teacher drawing salary from two schools. The police completed investigation in the 2017 complaint and the case will come up for trial, hence the court disposed of the petition. However, the bench wanted to know what had happened with regard to the 2013 complaint and sought a reply from the SHO of the concerned police station on January 14 this year. After the SHO failed to respond, the bench sought his presence and imposed a cost of ₹10,000 from the officer’s salary. After the officer submitted that he did not get the court order as the fax machine was not working, the court withdrew the cost. The officer then offered to donate ₹2,500 to the court library at Aurangabad, which the court declined and said, “We are of the view that the SHO should purchase latest bare acts on criminal laws like the Indian Penal Code; Code of Criminal Procedure; Evidence Act, the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989; Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012; Prevention of Terrorism Act, 2002; Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act, 1999; Maharashtra Prevention of Dangerous Activities of Slumlords, Bootleggers, Drug-Offenders/Dangerous Persons and Video Pirates Act, 1981; Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005, etc. for Vasmatnagar Rural police station.” The court said that as the petition was based on the 2017 complaint and was being disposed, Galande was at a liberty to resort to proper remedy for redressal of his 2013 complaint.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-directs-cop-to-buy-law-books-for-rural-police-station-101618772908060.html

After the second week of March, both the Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC) and Panvel City Municipal Corporation (PCMC) started taking stringent actions to curb the violations such as not wearing masks or maintaining social distance and spitting in public places, among others.The police have also additionally registered 147 first information reports (FIRs) and booked around 2,000 people for violating the norms during the one-month period. Suresh Mengade, DCP (zone 1), said, “Even as the number of cases is increasing rapidly, some people are still behaving carelessly. We are taking action against such violators under the relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), the Epidemic Diseases Act and the Maharashtra Covid-19 Regulations, 2020.”The police had formed special squads under the zonal deputy commissioners of police (DCPs) and started visiting the vegetable market at Panvel, APMC market in Vashi and other public and private events. They also started conducting nakabandis on all major roads from the first week of this month. “After the lockdown, several people were penalised under the Motor Vehicle Act for triple seats on two-wheelers and not stopping even after being asked to, by on-duty officers. Our priority is not to take action against maximum people, but to create awareness and thereby reduce the violations. We appeal to residents to not put themselves and their family members at risk by violating the norms,” Mengade further said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/79698-citizens-in-navi-mumbai-fined-for-flouting-norms-within-a-month-101618772848642.html
19-04-2021||Mumbai||Bombay HC quashes punishment of convicted principal||The Bombay high court (HC) recently set aside the 2011 conviction of the principal of a government-run training institute who was tried for offences under the Prevention of Corruption Act and was sentenced to two years of rigorous imprisonment. The court dismissed the conviction on the grounds that the principal secretary of school education department had not applied his mind independently while sanctioning criminal proceedings against the principal as the chief minister (CM) had already sanctioned it. The principal had asked the management of an institute to pay him ₹1 lakh as gratification for getting them an approval from the education department. The institute had lodged a complaint with Satara police and the principal was apprehended while accepting ₹50,000. The single bench of justice Bharati Dangre, while hearing the appeal against the May 2011 conviction by a special court, was informed that the appellant had been tried for offences under sections 7, 13(1)(d) read with section 13(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 and was to undergo two sentences of rigorous imprisonment for two years each. Advocate Girish Kulkarni for the appellant informed the court that as his client was working in a government institute, he was treated as a public servant and the procedure against him was initiated accordingly. In 2009, an institute had approached the appellant seeking his intervention in getting the approval for 10 additional students admitted by them from the deputy director of education. Though he was bound to help the institute, the principal sought a gratification of ₹1 lakh. The institute lodged a complaint after the principal accepted ₹50,000 and he was booked for the same in 2011. Kulkarni submitted that as the principal drew a salary of more than ₹10,000, sanction to prosecute him was sought from the ministry of school education. In turn, the ministry sent it for approval to the CM. On receipt of approval from the chief minister’s office, criminal proceedings against the principal started and he was tried and sentenced. Kulkarni said that as the issue of giving sanction for prosecution was serious, the ministry should have applied its mind after receiving the approval from the CM. He further submitted that the officer concerned had admitted to not applying his mind, and hence the entire prosecution and conviction was not valid and should be set aside. After hearing the submissions, the bench observed, “The sanction accorded by the sanctioning authority is an invalid sanction, and at this stage, it is also not possible to relegate the prosecution to obtain a fresh sanction since more than a decade has elapsed when the appellant was arraigned as an accused and it is too late in the day to prosecute him with the fresh sanction, at this stage. The lacuna on part of the prosecution, therefore, leaves no room other than to discharge the appellant of the charges levelled against him.” The bench then quashed and set aside the judgement of conviction and disposed of the appeal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-quashes-punishment-of-convicted-principal-101618772848135.html

The state reported the highest single-day spike of 68,631 cases, taking the tally to 3,839,338. Maharashtra also breached a grim milestone of 60,000 deaths after adding 503 deaths – the highest single-day surge after 215 days – when 515 deaths were reported on September 15. The state’s Covid-19 toll now stands at 60, 473. The latest 10,000 deaths were reported in 99 days, after the 50,000-mark was crossed on January 9. Maharashtra had breached the 40,000 deaths-mark on October 10.Mumbai reported 8,468 cases and 53 deaths on Sunday, followed by Pune (6,541 cases and 36 deaths), Nagpur with 4,724 cases and 22 deaths and Nashik (2,049 cases and three deaths).Currently, there are 670,388 active cases in the state. Pune has the most (122,486) number of active cases, followed by Mumbai (86,688).Dr Satyendranath Mehra, medical director at Masina Hospital in Byculla, attributed the high mortality rate to the shortage of oxygen cylinders and ICU (intensive care unit) beds. “We are seeing the shortage of these essential things along with medicines like Remdesivir,” said Dr Mehra. The state continued to face shortage of both Remdesivir and Tocilizumab drugs, leaving patients relatives anxious. Health minister Rajesh Tope said, “Local authorities need to distribute these doses according to the need of the patients.”He added that citizens must not ignore any symptoms. “People need to test if they experience any symptom. My study has shown that people are dying if they don’t act on time,” said Tope. The health minister also said that police chiefs should launch crackdown on crowding and citizens should cooperate in following the strict restrictions imposed on them. “We are getting at least 70,000 cases and more than 80% are asymptomatic. I am sure the peak will come down in five days. But we need to break this chain and not indulge in any behaviour which will increase the cases, and must comply with Covid-19 appropriate behaviour,” said Tope, adding that people need to vaccinate irrespective of any comorbidities.There were 126,138 vaccinations given on Sunday. Tope said the state has the capacity to vaccinate 800,000 people per day. “We have asked the Centre to provide us with at least 4,000,000 doses every week,” said Tope.Amid the ongoing curfew imposed from April 15 in the state, the police and local authorities in a few districts imposed stricter curbs. In Jalgaon, a hospital’s licence was cancelled as it was found that doctors and nurses were not wearing PPE (personal protective equipment) kits while attending Covid-19 patients. The curbs in places such as Nanded, Wardha and Amravati were further tightened as the local administration allowed all essential shops to remain open only till afternoon. Only medical stores will be exempted from this order.Dr Mehra said the restrictions need to be tightened further. “We are still seeing people without masks, not maintaining distance and roaming unnecessarily. This needs to be stopped and authorities need to be strict.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/maharashtras-covid-19-toll-crosses-60-k-state-sees-68-631-new-cases-101618772787471.html

The director was questioned for around 45 minutes and was allowed to leave after a senior BJP leader intervened. The deputy commissioner of police (DCP) Manjunath Singe said, “We have questioned a director and he was allowed to go, but further inquiries are in the process as per the information received. Based on facts, appropriate action will be taken”. According to the police, an inspector of the Vile Parle police station had received a tip-off about the storage of large quantities (60,000 vials) of Remdesivir medicines by a pharmaceutical company. It was allegedly going to be illegally flown out abroad by air cargo. The stock of Remdesivir could not be exported due to an existing ban by the Government of India, said an officer. Remdesivir is considered a life-saving medicine for Covid-19 patients. Based on the information, one director of the pharmaceutical company was called to the BKC police station for inquiry and a team from the Food of Drugs Administration (FDA) was also informed. The senior FDA officials in Mumbai were also aware of it, mentioned the press release issued by Mumbai Police. Around 11:15pm, former chief minister of Maharashtra and Opposition leader Devendra Fadnavis along with senior politician Praveen Darekar, Parag Alavani and Prasad Lad visited BKC police station. Fadnavis inquired why the director of the pharmaceutical company was called to the police station, reads the press note. Fadnavis said, “The permission was taken from FDA commissioner to donate the stock of Remdesivir vials to the Maharashtra government, as Remdesivir stocked for export cannot be diverted to the domestic market without permission from the Drug Controller General of India (DGCA) or FDA. The communication from FDA to the pharmaceutical company was not shared with the BKC police station, which was acting independently on the information available with them, said Mumbai Police spokesperson and deputy commissioner of police S Chaitanya. Based on the information, Mumbai Police acted in good faith and the director of the company was called for an inquiry to trace and seize the 60,000 vials of Remedesivir medicines. The inquiry was compulsory due to the complaint of black marketing of Remdesivir and shortage being faced by the state government to help the citizens, added Chaitanya.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/remdesivir-excess-stocking-mumbai-police-to-call-directors-of-pharma-firm-for-inquiry-101618772668146.html

It will be decided after an all-party meeting tomorrow. The chief minister will take the decision after a detailed discussion with leaders,” health & family welfare and medical education minister K Sudhakar said on Sunday. The minister’s statements come on a day Karnataka inched towards 20,000 Covid caseload mark, with Bengaluru accounting for 12,793 new infections. The state recorded its highest-ever single-day spike with 19,067 new cases being recorded in 24 hours that takes its total active case count to 133,543, of which 97,897 are in Bengaluru, according to the daily health bulletin of the state health department. Positivity rate breached the 13% mark. Bengaluru accounted for 60 out of the 81 fatalities reported across the state. Amid the spike in cases, India’s IT capital faces issues, such as shortage of vaccine and critical drugs like Remdesivir, near-full occupancy rates in hospitals and limited curbs that have added to the spread of the virus. Sudhakar said legal action will be initiated against private hospitals that do not reserve half of their beds for Covid patients. “Manipal Hospital has not provided 50% beds. Strict instructions have been given to the hospital. Legal action will be initiated if they fail to obey the orders. Let us not land in such a situation,” he said. Chief minister BS Yediyurappa, who has tested positive for Covid-19, is being treated at Manipal Hospital. The situation in Bengaluru has deteriorated in the past few weeks, with most hospital beds in public and private medical establishments reporting nearly full occupancy. There are 6,117 beds allocated for Covid-19 across private and public medical facilities in Bengaluru, of which 4,492 are occupied. There are only 29 beds left in intensive care units (ICU) and those with ventilators across all public and private hospitals and medical colleges, according to real-time bed availability data of the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP). There are 620 persons admitted in ICUs across the state. “There are seven medical oxygen production plants in Karnataka with a daily production capacity of 812 tonnes; the medical oxygen utilised on Saturday was 272.61 tonnes. So I appeal to everyone to not create unnecessary panic about shortage of medical oxygen in the state,” the minister tweeted. He said zonal officers have been deployed to manage any shortage. According to the health department bulletin, 11 districts reported over 100 cases, four over 200, two districts over 300 cases and another two over 400. Kalaburagi reported 671 new infections and Mysuru 777. Revenue minister R Ashok said the government will come up with a special set of guidelines for Bengaluru, but has ruled out a lockdown. Senior ministers are scheduled to meet on Monday to take a final decision on proposed guidelines aimed to contain the Covid surge in the city and the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/govt-plans-stringent-rules-to-curb-2nd-wave-in-bengaluru-101618772667461.html
19-04-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai Police chief checks for colour-coded stickers at traffic check points||After announcing an order to put colour coded stickers on vehicles on Saturday, Mumbai Police commissioner Hemant Nagrale visited Mulund and Dahisar check nakas on Sunday morning to oversee the implementation of the same. The decision is aimed at restricting movement of unwanted vehicles during the lockdown and ensuring there are no traffic jams at entry-exit points and toll nakas for uninterrupted movement of ambulances, vehicles for doctors and nursing staff. Vehicles found violating the sticker order will be booked under the Disaster Management Act and Indian Penal Code for impersonation. While raising awareness about the stickers and clearing the doubts among commuters regarding the stickers, he said the police would not be distributing the stickers like they did for travel eligibility passes last year. He said for the safety and convenience of commuters, stickers could be made by vehicle owners or drivers by cutting a red, yellow or green paper in a circular shape of at least six inches radius. “The driver or the owner of the vehicle will have to stick the paper on the front and rear wind shield of the vehicle so that the officers can identity for what purpose the vehicle is travelling. This will help to refrain people from traveling unnecessarily,” said Nagrale as he stuck a red sticker on a vehicle. Nagrale added that the stickers will be available at toll booths at Mulund and Dahisar. Mumbai Police ordered for the colour coding on Saturday after vehicles used by doctors and ambulances were allegedly stuck at check nakas due to restrictions imposed by the state government. Accordingly, vehicles used by doctors, medical staff, ambulances and medical equipment supplies will sport a red sticker. Vehicles involved in transporting food, vegetables, fruits, groceries and dairy products will have green stickers and other essential service providers will use the yellow stickers. On Sunday, Nagrale also said that the stickers would enable the commuters to avoid direct contact with the officers, thus helping in curtailing the spread of Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-police-chief-checks-for-colour-coded-stickers-at-traffic-check-points-101618772608029.html

These six states have reported high number of Covid-19 cases in recent weeks.The order came into effect immediately and remains in force until further announcement.Passengers from these states have also been banned from travelling to Maharashtra without a reserved ticket. The order issued by chief secretary Sitaram Kunte mandates proper management of passengers alighting at each of the stations in Maharashtra, with close coordination between state and railway authorities. The order has stated that passengers travelling to Maharashtra with confirmed tickets need to possess a negative RT-PCR test report, and the test should have been done within 48 hours before the travel. It said that the railways needs to share with the local disaster management authority (DMA) where the passengers will disembark in Maharashtra, four hours before the journey. The order also stated that passengers who have not undergone RT-PCR tests will have to take rapid antigen tests at railway stations. “If any passenger is found to be Covid-19 positive, they will be moved to the quarantine centre. Passengers who have no symptoms or whose test reports are negative will be stamped and will have to undergo 15 days of home quarantine. In case they violate the rules, they will be fined ₹1,000 and moved to institutional quarantine,” it further stated.

Some of them are under observation for the past one year, a senior officer said.The forest officers had a tough time due to the non-availability of certain foods and other facilities for the birds during the lockdown last year. They have not faced any such challenges so far, this year.Pradeep Chavan, range forest officer of the sanctuary, said, “When it comes to taking care of the birds, we need to concentrate mainly on two things – food of their choice and proper medical treatment. The black kites for instance, eat only non-vegetarian food, hence we are providing them with chicken. Likewise, we are offering different grains and fruits to the other birds. These birds will be under our observation till they recover and can fly properly.”“As far as the medical treatment is concerned, we don’t have our own veterinarian. So, we call in an officer from Kharpada from time to time and she prescribes medicines after examining the birds. Proper arrangement for the well-being of these birds is made here,” said Chavan. He added that these birds were rescued from different places of Mumbai and Navi Mumbai. “The black kites were rescued from areas such as Sewri, Nhava Sheva and Uran. Most of the cockatoos were rescued from Crawford Market in Mumbai,” he said.The sanctuary was shut for tourists from Thursday following the new restrictions imposed by the state government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/despite-lockdown-26-birds-given-treatment-at-navi-mumbai-s-karnala-sanctuary-101618772548155.html

Singh claimed that he worked as a technical director in Bruck Pharma company in Daman, while Kundra owns a furniture store at Vapi, said superintendent of police, Rajdeep Singh Jhala.We received a tip-off about Kundra selling Remdesivir injection at a higher price than the market, hence an officer of SOG was sent as a decoy. Sub-inspector Amirajsingh Rana approached him as a customer and asked him that he required a few injections as a person known to him was suffering from Covid-19. Kundra agreed to give one injection for ₹12,000, said Jhala.The trap was laid on Thursday and Kundra was arrested when he came to deliver the injection from Vapi to Valsad. During the search, police found a total of 12 injections from his possession. During interrogation, he confessed that he got injections from his friend Singh, who worked in a pharmaceutical firm in Daman. Kundra was then asked to make a call to Singh and tell him that he got more customers who required injections. Singh then came to deliver the medicines and the police arrested him. During the search police recovered six injections from his possession, added Jhala.Both the accused were arrested under the charges of 420 (cheating), 114 of the Epidemic Disease Act and other relevant sections of the Essential Commodity Act.

19-04-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Only 43 ICU, 19 ventilator beds are vacant||Even as the city inches towards near-complete utilisation of Intensive Care Unit (ICU) beds and ventilator beds – on Sunday, there were only 43 and 19 vacant according to the municipal authority’s dashboard – the 24 war rooms, set up during the first wave of the pandemic to ensure decentralised distribution of beds, are also finding it difficult to cope with the surge in requests. HT called the helplines of all war rooms, set up to manage 24 wards together, and found that while citizens living in the eastern suburbs and those in south and central Mumbai could connect easily with representatives of their war rooms, the numbers of control rooms in the western suburbs were either busy or went unanswered in the western suburbs. To be sure, a surge in cases (Mumbai recorded 8,468 on Sunday) and fast depleting beds (of the 20,608 hospital beds, 17,005 are occupied) have made it difficult for war rooms to allocate beds. To add to this, the city is also facing a shortage of oxygen – the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) on Saturday shifted 168 patients out of six hospitals to jumbo Covid centres due to the unavailability of medical-grade oxygen needed to treat critical patients. Yet citizens around the city have complained of their inability to get through the helplines; many have also said that they have had to wait for at least 24 hours to get a bed for critical patients. “The problems encountered with ward war control rooms are also being looked into. Considering suddenly there is a surge in cases and the staff is also getting adapted with the changes. We are making all efforts to ensure that every citizen gets a bed,” Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner, said. The BMC set up 24 war rooms set up at various wards in Mumbai last May as a decentralised bed management system; each is headed by an assistant commissioner who takes decisions related to the hospitals and Covid centres, ventilators and beds; and residents are required to call the helpline number if they require a bed. On March 30, as the daily caseload began to rise rapidly, BMC commissioner IS Chahal issued an order reiterating that all hospital admissions should be routed through the ward level war rooms to avoid the chaos experienced during the first wave when several patients ran from the pillar to post to get a bed. No direct admission in any Covid Care Centre or private hospitals would be permitted without prior intimation to the ward war room. The order also stated that 80% of the total beds and 100% of ICU beds in private hospitals shall be kept reserved only for the allotment through the ward war rooms for Covid-19 patients. “We have faced some difficulties recently in finding a ventilator bed for patients, or an ICU bed. If BMC beds are fully occupied, we start calling private hospitals to check if beds are available in the 20% quota of reserved private beds. We then inform the patient of this availability and ask them if they can pay,” a war room official said, on condition of anonymity. At present, the city has 10,227 oxygen beds (661 are vacant), 2,765 ICU beds, and 1,415 ventilator beds. War room officials have admitted that there are delays of a few hours in allotting ventilator and ICU beds to covid-19 patients, due to the rise in cases. They said it was easier to allot beds to asymptomatic patients in quarantine centres, or to mild symptomatic patients who do not need ICU and ventilator beds. A spokesperson from Dr LH Hiranandani Hospital, Powai, said, “For the past month, all Covid-19 beds in our hospital are occupied. While 80% of them are allotted by BMC’s war room itself, we frequently receive requests from the war room to check availability in 20% beds also. We also directly receive calls from patients to check if beds in this quota are available.” Citizens have complained that beds allotted by the control room in a private hospital end up being occupied after reaching the site. Vile Parle resident Nita Gupta said, “It took me around two days to get my 73-year-old father admitted to a hospital. He has multiple comorbidities, and his symptoms included high fever, shivering, weakness and dipping oxygen. But we did not get a bed for 24 hours. Later, on the second day, we got allotted a bed, but when we called the hospital, they said they do not have any bed. It was finally on Friday afternoon that my father could get a bed. I hope we have not lost crucial time. The system should be such that citizens are allotted beds within hours of reporting. We do not want patients to die because they did not get any treatment or bed.” Each morning at 4 am, officials at a war room receive a list of Covid-19 positive patients, along with their reports on email. Within two hours, operators at the ward war rooms begin to call patients: they enquire about the severity of symptoms to check if beds need to be allotted, or whether the patient needs to be shifted to a quarantine centre. Each war room has close to 40 officials who work in three, eight-hour-long shifts. The doctors appointed at the war room decide whether an oxygen bed, ICU bed, ventilator bed or a normal hospital bed is to be allotted to the patient. Once a bed is assigned against a patient’s name in the system, an ambulance from the ward is dispatched. While every call lasts for about 10 minutes, it can take over an hour to dispatch an ambulance to the patient’s home, a ward official said. “We are getting calls from around 500 to 600 patients daily requesting us to arrange beds for them,” Ruben Mascarenhas, national secretary from Aam Aadmi Party Mumbai, said. A BMC official said, “The allocation at ward war control room is done based on severity and there is no scope of leaving any patient without a bed. Also, helplines may be difficult to be in touch with considering western suburbs also have the highest case-load of active cases due to which helplines are busier there than compared to other parts of the city.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-only-43-icu-19-ventilator-beds-are-vacant-101618772428550.html

Relatives of the patients are currently being asked to arrange for Remdesivir themselves. “We have formed the logistics based on the requirement in both private and government hospitals, based on which, we have informed medical companies regarding the requirement. But we are yet to receive enough doses as per the demand,” said a senior officer from Thane district. Meanwhile, relatives of the patients in need of Remdesivir are struggling to get the medicine. “We contacted the district helpline number but to no avail. When we reached out to many contacts provided by our friends and relatives, we realised that there are many trying to fleece you by selling it for a huge sum,” said Satish Ghorpade, 42, whose father is admitted to a hospital in Kalyan as he is Covid positive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/thane-special-cell-struggles-with-shortage-of-remdesivir-101618772429147.html

Around 5,000 staff from the authority’s health department have been engaged in the drive, officials said.The authority has engaged six fire tenders, 26 water pressure tankers, 39 pressure machines and 42 battery spray machines to cover 64 residential areas, 20 villages and 66 housing societies for proper sanitization of surfaces and walls, said the officials.“We are properly sanitizing the public spaces in both rural and urban areas to minimise the Covid-19 risk,” said SC Mishra, senior project engineer, Noida authority.On Sunday, the authority covered industrial sectors from 1 to 11, and some residential sectors, including 14, 15, 15A, 19, and from 20 to 25, among others. “We covered commercial areas of sector 18, Atta Market, and markets in sectors 104 and sector 50,” said Mishra.The authority’s team covered villages, such as Mamura, Gijhaud, Nagla Charan Das, Sorkha, Gejha and Kakrala, among others. “We covered 20 villages on Sunday, and take up other villages on Monday. Our motive is that all villages, markets, and other public places are sanitized,” said Mishra.The authority also conducted sanitization in housing societies such as Jaypee Wish Town, Prateek Wisteria, Zenith and Supertech Romano, among others, the officials said.The authority is using sodium hypochlorite solution as disinfectant. “We have directed the staff to spray the solution properly so that no spot stays uncovered,” said Mishra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-authority-begins-intense-sanitisation-drive-101618772368759.html
19-04-2021||Other||TN imposes curbs at night, Sunday from April 20 to curb Covid spread||Chennai: Tamil Nadu on Sunday announced a night curfew between 10pm and 4am and a complete lockdown on Sundays effective from April 20 to curb the spread of Covid-19 infections. The decision came after chief minister Edappadi Palaniswami held a meeting with senior officials to discuss measures to curtail the surge in cases. Tamil Nadu on Sunday reported 10,723 new cases, the highest this year, taking the Covid tally in the state to 991,451. Chennai accounted for the highest caseload with 3,304 cases, according to the health department data. A total of 108,155 RT-PCR tests were conducted across the state on Sunday. The new restrictions will remain in place until further orders as counting for assembly poll results will take place on May 2, the government has decided. Class 12 board examinations for the state board students have been postponed, but practical exams, which got underway on Friday, will continue. The state has asked government and private colleges and universities to conduct their classes and exams online. During the Sunday lockdowns, only essential activities like milk supply, newspaper delivery, medical services, commodity transport and vehicles carrying petrol and diesel are permitted. Meat and vegetable shops, cinemas and commercial establishments will be closed. Takeaway services will be allowed in restaurants at stipulated timings. During the night curfew, private and public transportation, taxis and autos, and transportation within the state will not be allowed. Transportation will be allowed for purposes of medical services and for carrying people to and from railway stations and airports. On other days, the rule for 50% capacity in restaurants and theatres will continue. Journalists, petrol bunks, and industries producing essentials can continue to work. All beaches across the state are now out of bounds for the public. Tourism to Ooty, Kodaikanal and other destinations is prohibited. Public will also not be allowed to go to museums, parks, zoos, and ASI sites. Infections began to rise in Tamil Nadu ahead of the assembly elections held on April 6. By March 24, the state reported 1,636 cases. The polling day recorded 3,645 fresh cases. Last year, during the first wave, Tamil Nadu for weeks had the second highest caseload in the country. Besides urging people to get vaccinated, the health department and civic bodies are bringing back measures from last year, such as conducting at least 100,000 RT-PCR tests, and opening fever camps and triage or screening centres, which helped in identifying cases early and reducing the burden on hospitals. Chennai has opened 12 screening centres across 15 zones. “If their condition seems to be fine, we send them back home. Those who need doctor supervision, they will be sent to the Covid care centre,” said Greater Chennai Corporation commissioner G Prakash. “Those who need to be admitted to hospital come in the third category.” Experts say localised restrictions are necessary to control the virus spread and ensure that hospitals that are fast filling up aren’t overburdened. “We are likely to see multiple peaks we experienced last year, so it’s important to cancel social events and avoid large gatherings, especially in enclosed spaces,” said Prabhdeep Kaur, deputy director of the National Institute of Epidemiology.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/tn-imposes-curbs-at-night-sunday-from-april-20-to-curb-covid-spread-101618772368111.html

Police said that the girl was rescued from the suspect’s residence in Ghaziabad’s Indirapuram.According to police, the victim, who lived with her parents at Gaur City in Greater Noida West, had gone for her coaching class in the neighbourhood on March 1 and was missing since then. The victim’s father had lodged a complaint at Bisrakh police station on March 1. “My daughter had left home for a coaching class at 7am in the neighbourhood. But she did not return home. We launched a search but could not find her,” he said. Anita Chauhan, SHO, Bisrakh police station, said that a case was registered against unknown persons under Section 363 (kidnapping) of Indian Penal Code. “The girl was carrying her mother’s mobile phone when she went missing,” the SHO said. Chauhan said that a police team launched an investigation and scanned the call details of the mobile phone. “We found that the girl was in touch with a person named Vinod Kumar, a resident of Indirapuram. On Sunday, we received information about the suspect’s movement near Sudamapuri bridge in Greater Noida West. Our team reached the spot and arrested him,” she said. Then the police team visited Kumar’s residence and rescued the victim, the SHO said. “We have conducted the victim’s medical examination. On Monday, the suspect will be produced in court,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/man-arrested-for-kidnapping-16-year-old-girl-101618772367481.html
19-04-2021||Noida||Noida’s Arjun Vajpai to scale Everest for 2nd time; no O2 support this time||Mountaineer Arjun Vajpai, 27, reached the Everest Base Camp on Saturday evening to climb Mount Everest again. This would be his second attempt to scale the Earth’s highest mountain above sea level, but this time, without any oxygen support.Along with his father Colonel Sanjeev Vajpai and mother Priya Vajpai, the Noida resident started his journey from Nepal’s small mountain town Lukla to the base camp on April 8 morning. “I began trekking from Lukla to Khumbu Valley on April 8 and crossed some amazing places on the way, such as Phakding, Namche Bazaar, and Tengboche. It was a nostalgic journey... seeing all these villages after so many years,” said Vajpai.Following acclimatisation at the base camp, Vajpai begins his summit on April 24/ 25 — depending on the weather — and is likely to reach the peak 30 days later. According to Sparsh Tyagi, Vajpai’s manager, the 27-year-old “hopes to reach the peak on May 22 — exactly 11 years since his first climb”.In 2010, Vajpai — then 16 years old — became the youngest Indian to climb Mount Everest. However, Malavath Poorna, 13, broke the record in 2014 and became the youngest to climb the mountain.At 8,848 metres above sea level, the air on the summit is thin, and most mountaineers require to carry oxygen cylinders with them. A mountaineer has around three to four oxygen cylinders, weighing eight to nine kilograms each, making the climb even more daunting. According to National Geographic magazine, by 2017, around 200 mountaineers have successfully climbed Everest without supplemental oxygen.Trained in Almora during Covid lockdown in 2020“I had dreamt of going on this expedition in 2020 but couldn’t, following the coronavirus outbreak in March,” he said over the phone.Before the coronavirus-induced lockdown in 2020, Vajpai used to cycle on the Noida-Greater Noida Expressway thrice a week, covering a distance of 60 kilometers to increase his lung capacity. He used to run 60 kilometers thrice a week, without any time limit. After the lockdown was imposed, according to Vajpai, he used his 20-storey apartment in Sector 51 to lightly train his body by climbing stairs up and down daily. In June 2020, he moved to the house his parents own in Uttarakhand’s Almora, for rigorous training. The hills and mountains there offered him a bigger challenge to meet.“I have been a mountaineer for more than 11 years. Right from the age of 16, when I had climbed Everest, I have been climbing other peaks — even as high as 8,000 metres. I have been training hard, and my body has evolved. Now, I don’t feel the need to carry supplemental oxygen during my climbs,” he said, adding that seeing other mountaineers climb Everest without any oxygen support has also inspired him.“I realised that there are no limits to our dreams. The only barrier is in our minds. I saw so many great climbers scaling Everest without supplemental oxygen. Their names are on the list of elite mountaineers today. Seeing them, I was inspired to do the same,” said Vajpai.‘Will come full circle if I return with all fingers, toes’Remembering his days in Kathmandu in 2010, Vajpai said, “Memories are rushing back to me as I’m here in Kathmandu after 11 years. Back then, no one believed in me and rubbished the idea of a 16-year-old climbing Everest. And the rest is history. I don’t think I have come full circle yet. It will be only when I come back after achieving the feat with all ten fingers and toes this time.”Vajpai will be climbing the Earth’s highest mountain above sea level from the Nepal side with Sherpa (expedition organising firm ‘Asian Trekking’ has assigned the sherpa guide to him). “Earlier, I had planned to climb Everest from the Tibet side without a sherpa. However, as that side is closed, I had to change my plans. Nepal does not allow a solo climber, so I have to go with the sherpa,” Vajpai said.Following his conquest of Everest, Vajpai had successfully climbed Mount Lhotse (8,516 metres) and Mount Manaslu (8,163 metres) in 2011, Mount Makalu (8,485 metres) and Mount Cho Oyu (8,201 metres) in 2016, and Mount Kanchenjunga (8,586 metres) in 2018.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noidas-arjun-vajpai-to-scale-everest-for-2nd-time-no-o2-support-this-time-101618772309374.html
19-04-2021||Noida||Covid-19: Markets closed, streets empty during weekend lockdown in Noida||Following the coronavirus-induced partial weekend lockdown in Uttar Pradesh, markets in Noida — except for essential services — remained closed on Sunday, and the streets were empty as most people chose to stay home amid a sharp spike in the number of cases in the city.On Friday, the Yogi Adityanath-led government had announced the lockdown from Saturday night to Monday morning, while the night curfew hours were extended only days before.“Shops providing essential services like medicines and groceries were open, while the rest of the market remained closed. Most of the shops were closed on Saturday too, due to a complete weekend lockdown in Delhi... Meanwhile, the footfall in the market has also reduced as people are scared amid the surge in Covid-19 cases,” said Sushil Kumar Jain, president, Sector 18 Market Association.The residential authorities have also urged the people to remain indoors.“We had asked the residents to stock up essential goods ahead of the lockdown. The only movement seen in several sectors was for essential goods. In local markets too, only shops providing medicines or groceries were open. Guards or police did not report any suspected violation. We have multiple positive cases in Sector 34, so people are scared of venturing out,” said KK Jain, secretary general, Federation of Noida Residents Welfare Associations.Agencies also utilised the lockdown for the purpose of sanitisation. “Eleven of our fire tenders were out today, for the sole purpose of sanitising prominent markets and public spaces,” said Arun Kumar Singh, chief fire officer.Meanwhile, the Noida police is imposing challans on people violating Covid-19 guidelines, with nearly 4,500 challans issued per day. “Night curfew guidelines are monitored, especially in the border areas. Most of the shops in markets, malls, etc. are implementing the regulations. Today (weekend lockdown), there was minimum public movement, and it seems that people are understanding the importance of following guidelines and staying home,” said Rajesh S, deputy commissioner of police (zone 1).The Noida police has collected almost Rs.45 lakh in fines in the last 10 days, while around 200 vehicles have been seized. Police have also roped in places of worship as public address systems, urging people to avoid stepping out unnecessarily.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noidamarkets-closed-streets-empty-during-weekend-lockdown-101618772308708.html
19-04-2021||Mumbai||‘Lockdown may impact children’s social skills’||Shamika Singh, mother of a three-year-old from Goregaon, has been restless for the past one year. With the pandemic and the resultant lockdown, she and her family of five, including her husband, in-laws and daughter have been cooped inside their homes. Singh and her husband Utkarsh, both IT professionals, are working from home and are worried that their daughter Kiara has not been able to see the “outside world”.“She turned three recently and over the past one year, we have not been able to expose her to any external experiences. She has not been able to go to a regular play school and has not made any friends yet. All her experiences of the world are more or less virtual. This worries us because we want our daughter to play and learn from the surroundings,” said Singh.A large number of parents and teachers are worried that as children remain in their homes for so long, there might be challenges in retaining the skills they learnt and in learning new skills that are essential for their growth and development in the formative years. As schools and extra-curricular activities are carried out online, the social element in learning is what experts said is missing all this while. Swati Popat Vats, an early childhood expert and the president of the Early Childhood Association, said, “Children are not waiting for their turn or listening to others, which means they are not learning conversation skills. They are not able to share. In virtual learning, they bring their material and have to share it with no one. That is not the case in schools. Basics of social behaviour will be missing when our children go back to schools and this is going to impact our classrooms and to a large extent our society. Conflicts will be common in the classroom now, as children don’t have the patience or impulse control to wait for their turn, share etc.,” she added. Francis Joseph, a city-based educationist and the co-founder of SLN Global Network, said there is fear that children might take longer to undertake tasks that they earlier did with ease. “Simple things like crossing a small street can induce anxiety among them because they have just not done that activity for a year now,” he added. To overcome the challenge, experts now suggest that increased parental involvement and encouraging virtual group activities as a way out. Dr Samir Dalwai, a developmental paediatrician from New Horizons Child Development Center, said while there are a few challenges in learning at home, it is a very good opportunity for parents as they can finally give more time to the children. “They can read stories, play, organise chats with their relatives online and ensure that the child is kept busy without handing over gadgets to them. When we were children, our parents could not afford to take us on foreign trips. Our understanding of the world came through books and the things we observed around us. That is what matters,” he added. Vats suggested that schools organise small group play sessions with around five children in one group where children can chat and interact. “The adult will be present only to monitor the children. Just let the children talk about whatever they want. It can be like a play date, but virtually,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/lockdown-may-impact-children-s-social-skills-101618772247414.html
19-04-2021||Noida||Indirapuram residents complain of high-rises having Covid cases not contained, sanitised||Ghaziabad: The residents of various high-rises in Indirapuram have alleged that the district administration has not taken up sanitisation or containment procedures in their societies despite having multiple Covid-19 cases. According to records of the district administration, Ghaziabad had a total of 876 containment zones till Saturday, of which about 400 (45.66%) are under the Indirapuram police station limits.Also, of 2,300 active Covid-19 cases in the district, 469 cases are in the Indirapuram area, the data showed.As a result of the issues prevailing, the local RWAs/apartment owners’ associations (AOA) are forced to take the work of limited sanitisation in their own hands and they are also trying their best to contain the movement of infected patients. “We have 27 Covid cases in our high-rise comprising 441 flats. The cases have come in during the past 10 days or so, but no teams from the district administration have visited so far either to take up containment or sanitisation. We have been informing officials regularly but there is no response,” said Anil Sharma, president of Ashiana Upvan AOA in Ahimsa Khand II. The office bearers of ATS Advantage AOA said that they have a tally of about 125 cases in their high-rise having 1,968 flats. “No one has come so far for containment or sanitisation. We are doing sanitisation on our own. We also want that a testing camp should be held so that our residents can get themselves tested,” said Sanjay Jain, president of ATS Advantage AOA. The areas having positive cases are defined as containment zones where there is a restriction on movement of people, except in case of essential services. Members of other AOAs like the one at Exotica Elegance also echoed similar sentiments. “We have about 32-35 Covid cases known so far in our high-rise comprising 325 flats. There is no sealing or sanitisation. These patients are in five towers. Since, no teams of administration have come so far, we are forced to take up sanitisation on our own. In absence of containment by the administration, we cannot force residents to stay indoors but we are trying our best,” said KK Singh, president of Exotica Elegance AOA. Likewise, Niho-Scottish Garden high-rise has about 900 flats and the AOA members said that they have about 55 Covid cases. “There has been no sanitisation by the administration team, and we have been taking it up on our own. We are keeping an eye on affected patients and also built one isolation centre equipped with five beds, oxygen supply and medicines. On Saturday, we called up a corporation team for sanitisation with the help of our councillor. But there is no containment exercise taken up so far,” said Naresh Chhokar, president of the high-rise AOA. The district administration officials admitted that they were short of resources as many staff were deployed for the recently concluded panchayat elections. “We will get the containment and sanitisation exercise expedited in affected high-rises of Indirapuram. There has been some delay, but we will take it up at the earliest,” said Shailendra Kumar Singh, additional district magistrate (city) and in-charge of containment zones. District magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey was unavailable for comment.Meanwhile, Krishna Karunesh, vice-chairperson of Ghaziabad development authority (GDA), said, “We are taking up sanitisation on major roads and open areas in localities, and teams of administration and health department should assist us to help out the residents of high-rises,” said Karunesh. GDA maintains the Indirapuram locality.District administration officials familiar with the development also said that they were not getting proper information of cases from the district Covid command and control room and this is why they were not able to send timely information to the local police. HT on April 13 had published a report that many of the containment zones were not clearly demarcated and the ground level situation in the district is different from the list of containment zones which is updated on daily basis by the district administration. On April 3, UP chief secretary RK Tiwari issued an order for surveillance in which areas having one positive case was to be created as a containment zone in a radius of 25 metres (comprising about 20 houses), while areas having more than one case will be in form of a cluster and having a radius of 50 metres (comprising about 60 houses). For the high-rises, the directions said that in case of emergence of one Covid case, the entire floor will be contained while in case of multiple cases, the entire tower will be contained. In another order on April 11, the UP chief secretary had directed that the supply of essential commodities should be ensured in all containment zones. “We are taking up sanitisation on major roads and open areas in localities and teams of administration and health department should assist us to help out the residents of high-rises,” said Krishna Karunesh, vice-chairperson of Ghaziabad development authority, which maintains Indirapuram locality.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/indirapuram-residents-complain-of-high-rises-having-covid-cases-not-contained-sanitised-101618772187466.html

Out on bail, the former office boy looked for jobs but could not find one amid the nationwide lockdown. Dejected, Deepak found himself giving in to drugs, and was soon back in jail. Around 88% of released prisoners and women discharged from shelter homes in Maharashtra, who lost jobs during the Covid-19 pandemic, may have been pushed into destitution or forced to go back to crime or commercial sexual exploitation, a survey by Prayas, a field action project of the Centre for Criminology and Justice, Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS), Mumbai, has found. Prayas, a 31-year-old project of TISS, surveyed over 500 people to measure the effect of the pandemic on vulnerable groups who come in direct contact with the Indian criminal justice system. While a majority of the respondents (86%) were from Maharashtra, 9% were from Gujarat, 1% from Bihar and 4% from other states. Prayas essentially works in Maharashtra and Gujarat with populations affected by criminal justice. “Most of the offenders come from marginalised background but social stigma excludes them from availing government schemes and benefits. As a majority of them lack any vocational skills, their employment opportunities are further diminished,” said Vijay Raghavan, professor, centre for criminology and justice, school of social work, TISS, and project director of Prayas. “People in penal or protective custody essentially are from the same socioeconomic category as migrant workers or those working in the informal sector, but may be worse affected as they remain invisible. Our aim was to highlight the impact of the lockdown on this invisible group of people,” said Raghavan. Meeran Borwankar, an IPS (Indian Police Service) officer who retired as the director general, Bureau of Police Research and Development (BPRD) and National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), said, “Often those involved in property crime veer towards it again. Most other convicts/released inmates have records of body offences due to land disputes/interpersonal issues/emotional outbursts etc. They generally do not go back to a crime but as the survey points out, suffer extreme economic hardships. However, criminals involved in organised crime have a strong tendency to re-join their gangs. They pose a grave danger to the society during the pandemic.” More than half (59%) of those surveyed were women and were the worst-affected by the pandemic. Of the 12% that were able to retain employment after the lockdown, only 26% were women. At the same time, 69% of those who borrowed money during the lockdown were women. Ranjana (name changed), who works as a domestic help in Bhiwandi, lost her only source of income when her employer let go of her services during the lockdown. “I didn’t even have ration to feed my two children,” said Ranjana, whose husband is serving a life sentence in Amravati jail. Ranjana’s struggles to feed her children also reflected in other respondents –87% said they required support for their ration needs. “The findings of the survey clearly indicate the risks involved for the women respondents who might be driven to destitution, sexual exploitation or illegal activities due to economic pressures,” said Raghavan. While 20% of those surveyed were illiterate, 23% said they had studied up to Class 9 or Class 10, and 21% had an educational background of up to upper primary education (Class 6 to Class 8). Women fared worse as 28% were illiterate, while 20% each had upper primary and secondary education. Borwankar said that women convicts/released inmates are one of the most vulnerable sections of society. “My experience is that besides economic hardships, they face more social discrimination too. Pandemic has been a double whammy for them. This is the time when local communities and NGOs should chip in,” she said. In the past year, Prayas has raised and disbursed funds worth ₹10 lakh and distributed monthly rations to over 1,600 families with the help of NGOs (non-governmental organisations) and corporate social responsibility (CSR) wings of private organisations like the Azim Premji Philanthropic Initiatives and Godrej CSR. The survey found that 99% respondents faced difficulties in accessing justice and 35% said they did not have support from their families or community with regard to their cases. “The lockdown also restricted the quality and quantity of help that we could provide to our beneficiaries. For example, people like Deepak have to be looked after more closely to make sure that he doesn’t fall back to old ways. I couldn’t physically check on him as often and his ailing mother could do very little,” said Pravin Patil, a social worker working with Prayas. Mulakat The discontinuation of ‘Mulakat’, the visitation facility in prisons, affected the mental well-being of prisoners as well as their families, as 24% reported difficulties. While video calls were commenced for e-Mulakat between inmates and their families or lawyers, not everybody had access to a smart device and internet connection. “It’s been over five months since Deepak last saw his mother. He has become agitated and displaying violent behaviour. Mulakat is an essential part for the mental well-being of both prisoners as well as the family,” said Patil. However, for others like Ranjana, the e-Mulakat has been a boon. “To visit my husband, my children and I would have to undertake a two-day journey from Bhiwandi to Amaravati and back. At least now we know he’s just a phone call away. I hope e-Mulakat is a permanent feature,” she said. “At the time when physical Mulakat was stopped, there was no other option to contain the pandemic. The video calls have helped reduce the anxiety of many people during these testing times,” said Raghavan. Last year, Prayas had released a report on the best practices followed by prisons across the country in terms of the Mulakat and communication mechanisms adopted by them for inmates. The practices were analysed based on the ease of access to the prison system, the priority in focus and the policy and practice. Based on the analysis, Prayas had made recommendations to improve contact/relations between prisoners and their families. Some recommendations included a pre-booking facility for appointments, a facility to send money to the prisoner and basic facilities in the waiting/ Mulakat room such as wash rooms, drinking water taps, ceiling fans and air coolers. “Mulakat is a very important aspect in the rehabilitation of a prisoner upon release. It is more important for women in custody to be allowed to remain in touch with their children,” Raghavan added. “Post pandemic we need to discuss the survey findings of Prayas and engage with government, community, NGOs/activists for systematic rehabilitation programmes for prisoners to enable them to withstand future disasters of different kinds,” said Borwankar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/covid-impact-inmates-rescued-women-likely-to-be-pushed-back-to-crime-exploitation-says-survey-101618772128610.html

This statement comes as the Covid-positive patients complain of struggling to get beds for treatment.There are 2,496 Covid-19 beds available in the district — 1,538 in 25 private hospitals, and 958 in three government facilities in Sanjay Nagar, Santosh Medical College, and Rama Medical College (Pilkhuwa) — of which 1,786 are occupied, according to the official data as of Sunday.“About 72% of the total beds are occupied. These also include 440 ICU beds, of which 330 are occupied. We have only 210 vacant beds in private hospitals as of Sunday... There are issues of bed availability as some hospitals with regular oxygen supply problems are not admitting patients,” said an officer familiar with the development, requesting anonymity.HT on Saturday (April 17) published a report in which Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate, had assured of putting up a list showing the number of beds available over the official district website. He had also asked hospitals to put up the bed availability status at their premises. However, the arrangement did not materialise on Sunday.“Bed availability is a major issue as people keep calling us for help. We somehow got one patient admitted to a private hospital, but the patient was asked to arrange for oxygen supply and his family did so. There are instances where people said that they were willing to donate money to get beds for their family members. There is no way that the patients or their families can know the bed availability status. Instead, they keep on going from one hospital to the other in search of beds,” said Alok Kumar, founder member, Federation of Association of Apartment Owners.Meanwhile, Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer (CMO), said that the department is trying to increase the total number of beds, but Ghaziabad may still see a shortage in beds as patients in large numbers come from other districts for treatment. “Of the 72% occupancy, we have about 30% patients who have come from other districts for treatment. So, the occupancy is on the rise. We will streamline the process to ensure that the bed availability status is known to the patients,” he added.Experts from Indian Medical Association, Ghaziabad chapter, have also stepped in to fight the prevailing crisis. On Sunday, they said that they have initiated a WhatsApp helpline number: 9999081239, which will be operational from 9 am to 9 pm. “People facing issues can post messages on this number, and our experts will try to help them. It is estimated that about 80% of patients do not require hospitalisation, but they keep approaching the hospitals. Our experts, based on the patients’ health conditions, will suggest them if they require hospitalisation or can stay at home. Two of our experts will be available online (over zoom platform) from 3 pm to 4 pm on Thursdays and Saturdays, to reply to all the queries raised by the residents,” said Dr Ashish Agarwal, president, IMA (Ghaziabad).In the meantime, the Yogi Adityanath government in Uttar Pradesh has rolled out a policy for “presumptive patients” who tested negative, but have Covid-like symptoms in CT scan, X-ray, and blood sample reports.“The directions said that such patients will be treated like Covid patients if the attending doctors require that. They will be given treatment just like Covid-positive patients and will be kept at separate wards in Covid centres. We have also initiated giving pouches of different medicines to patients showing Covid symptoms, who come to our centres for testing. The idea is that those having symptoms should start an early treatment. The pouches are getting prepared, and we will start distribution soon at our testing centres,” said Dr Rakesh Gupta, district surveillance officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/ghaziabad-has-28-beds-vacant-even-as-patients-struggle-to-get-beds-101618772128072.html

While the first 5,000 cases were recorded in 145 days, the second and third 5,000s took 44 and 30 days, respectively. Though the last 5,000 cases took 106 days, 4,000 of them surfaced in only 18 days of the current month, the data showed. On Sunday, the district’s overall tally mounted to 30,530, which included 3,327 active cases. GB Nagar is on the ninth position among the districts having high active caseload in Uttar Pradesh, the data showed. Meanwhile, UP too registered its highest single-day spike of 30,596 Covid positive cases in the last 24 hours.The official data also shows that April has so far recorded maximum average cases per day, i.e. 242.5 cases per day, which is much worse than October last year, when the average cases per day had been recorded 187. The case fatality rate in the district on Sunday was 0.22%, the data showed.GB Nagar district magistrate Suhas LY said that the main aim of the administration now is to reduce the case fatality rate (CFR) and ensure timely hospitalisation and treatment of the infected patients. “Our bed allocation team, deputed in the integrated Covid-19 control room, is working round the clock. At present, the district has 13 Covid-dedicated facilities having capacity of 2,709 beds – of which 1,721 (63.52%) are occupied. We have 1,491 oxygen and 560 ICU beds, of which 1,098 (73.64%) and 508 (90.71%) are occupied. Besides, the Covid-19 facilities have 178 ventilator beds, of which 133 (74.72%) are vacant. So, the district doesn’t have any dearth of beds in its facilities,” he said. The DM also said that GB Nagar’s testing rate is the best among all major districts of north India. “Our testing rate per million per day is around 1,800, which is much better than other major districts in north India. Besides, our containment team is regularly keeping a watch on the areas from where the maximum cases are being detected. Our health teams are regularly monitoring the factories and other business establishments to ensure that the safety protocols are being followed there,” Suhas said. Chief medical officer Dr Deepak Ohri said that in the present situation, early and timely tracking and providing adequate treatment are the main goals before the health department. “The health workers have been told to ensure maximum contact tracing – finding out 25 contacts of one infected patient. We are testing nearly 6,000 people every day and treating infected patients as per symptoms,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/gb-nagar-s-covid-19-tally-crosses-30k-mark-last-4k-recorded-in-18-days-101618772127445.html

19-04-2021||Chandigarh||NDA exam: 10K aspirants appear at 40 centres in Chandigarh||The National Defence Academy (NDA) and Naval Academy (NA) exam, organised by the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC), was conducted smoothly at around 40 centres in Chandigarh on Sunday. Around 10,000 candidates from neighbouring states like Punjab, Haryana and Himachal Pradesh appeared at exam centres in the city.To facilitate the students, the UT administration had issued directions that candidates appearing for the exam should not be stopped, even as the weekend lockdown was in force on Sunday. Candidates confirmed that they were not inconvenienced in any way while they were on their way to appear for the exam. Taking measures to ensure Covid norms are followed, thermal screening was conducted at the entrance gates, entry without masks wasn’t allowed and social distancing was maintained. Lines were formed before the exam started at 10am.Most candidates were happy that the exam wasn’t delayed even as the CBSE examinations for Class-12 students has been postponed. Harjot Singh, a resident of Patiala said, “ I am glad that this exam wasn’t cancelled, as it would have made students restless, as there’s only so much one can revise.” Other students also aired similar sentiments. However, students from many centres said that attendance in their class was around 50% of the total class strength. Saying that low attendance could be attributed to this exam being held twice in a year and the second Covid wave , Kunal Singh, who runs a coaching centre in Sector 34 said, “While attendance stayed on the lower side this year, the cut-off is still likely to go high. The mathematics portion was easier than previous years and the second exam was also NCERT based.”The exam was to be conducted in two shifts, with a mathematics exam between 10am to 12pm and a general ability test between 2pm and 4pm.However, confusion broke out at Government Model Senior Secondary School (GMSSS), Sector 32, as the authorities wouldn’t let students leave the centre in between the two exams. However, it wasn’t mentioned in the exam notification that students aren’t allowed to go out in between shifts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/nda-exam-10k-aspirants-appear-at-40-centres-in-chandigarh-101618771890143.html
19-04-2021||Chandigarh||13 more arrested for violating weekend curfew in Chandigarh||Thirteen people were arrested for violating the curfew orders on Sunday, taking the total to 23, even though better compliance was witnessed on the second day of the weekend curfew in Chandigarh. UT adviser Manoj Parida said, “It was seen that compliance was better on Sunday. The administration will assess the situation in the coming days and take a call on whether the weekend lockdown will be held next week as well or not.”While non-essential shops remained closed, police presence was seen at various intersections of the city. Markets continued to wear deserted look, but some rush was witnessed near the Sector-26 mandi. Market officials said the influx was mostly of vendors who were coming here to buy vegetables. However, nakas weren’t set up inside the city and there was minimal checking at the union territory’s borders with Panchkula and Mohali. 96 challans issuedAs per the police, 96 challans were issued on Sunday. Out of these, eight were slapped on people without masks, 61 on those violating social distancing guidelines and 27 on those who were found spitting at public places. The police had on Saturday arrested 10 people for flouting guidelines. A total of ₹52,000 was collected as penalty on Sunday, ₹8,000 more than that on Saturday. Police spokesperson deputy superintendent of police (DSP) Charanjit Singh Virk said the emphasis was on spreading awareness and not challaning.Chandigarh churches have also announced that they won’t be holding Sunday service and other public liturgical services Monday onwards owing to the spike in Covid cases. The events will instead be live-streamed on the church’s social media accounts. Congress slams lockdown, calls it eyewashThe Congress’ Chandigarh unit slammed the decision to clamp a lockdown on weekend and called it an eyewash by the BJP-ruled Chandigarh administration. A spokesperson of the Chandigarh Congress said the administration has worked at snail’s pace in the war against Covid-19, specially during the second wave. “The lackadaisical and lethargic approach of the Chandigarh administration is appalling as the number of cases has gone up drastically. Now, in a bid to hide its incompetency and negligence in handling the second wave, the administration has imposed a lockdown without any prior intimation. This has affected the industry, businesses, small traders and street vendors, who had already stocked items for customers. Worst affected is a poor daily wager,” said HS Lucky, chief spokesperson of the Congress.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/13-more-arrested-for-violating-weekend-curfew-in-chandigarh-101618771828287.html
19-04-2021||Delhi||CM, L-G meet today on curfew; traders to decide on shutdown||Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, lieutenant governor Anil Baijal and chief secretary Vijay Dev are scheduled to meet on Monday to possibly discuss continuing restrictions, including the curfew, in the light of the unprecedented surge in Covid-19 cases, which has led to a severe shortage of oxygen supply and left the health care infrastructure in the city overburdened, people aware of the matter said.On Sunday, several trader groups pitched for voluntary closing of markets and resident groups demanded a short lockdown to arrest the surge in cases and break the chain of transmission.“The lieutenant governor, chief minister and chief secretary are scheduled to meet on Monday afternoon. The agenda involves review of Covid-19 cases, status of health care infrastructure and hospital management, and restrictions, including the possibility of imposing a curfew in the city like the one that was implemented over the weekend,” said a senior official, who did not wish to be identified.On Thursday, the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) – chaired by Baijal – imposed a weekend curfew, temporarily shut shopping malls, gyms, spas and entertainment parks, capped the capacity of cinema halls and multiplexes at 30%, barred dining at restaurants, and limited weekly markets to one per day in a municipal zone.Also Read| Covid-19: What you need to know todayWith no immediate decision being taken on extension of the weekend curfew, things will get beck to normal in Delhi on Monday morning, the senior official said, adding that what happens in the coming days will depend on what transpires in the meeting on Monday.On Saturday, Kejriwal had said that he shall not refrain from implementing stricter restrictions if the Covid-19 situation does not come under control.Dr Lalit Kant, former head of the division of epidemiology and communicable diseases at the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) said, “Delhi needs strict restrictions at this juncture. No gatherings can be allowed in the light of the extreme rate of transmission of Covid-19. The situation is out of control and the health care system is inching towards a total collapse.”With Delhi reporting 25,462 Covid-19 cases on Sunday, the market associations in the city said they were contemplating closing down the markets in a bid to “break the chain of transmission”.While market associations of prominent Delhi markets such as Khan Market, Connaught Place, Sarojini Nagar, Lajpat Nagar, Karol Bagh have called a meeting on Monday to take a call on shutting markets, the traders’ association of Chandni Chowk market has appealed to all its traders to keep the market closed till April 25.Sanjay Bhargava, president of Chandni Chowk Sarv Vyapar mandal, said, “We held a video conference meeting of all members and it was unanimously decided to keep the market close till April 25th. We have appealed to all traders to close the market. We will review the situation on April 25 and take further measures. The situation in the city is such that it is important to take such steps. The most alarming aspect is the galloping positivity rate and shortages of hospital beds, oxygen,ventilators and medicines and other medical facilities in use of the epidemic.”Chemical merchant association, Delhi Kirana Committee and Khari Baoli traders have also decided to keep the market shut.Traders association of Sarojini Nagar market held a virtual meeting, seeking the opinion of all traders on the way forward. Ashok Randhawa, president of Sarojini Nagar mini-market association said, “Close to 60% traders are of the view that the market should be closed. But a final decision will be taken by tomorrow.”Traders said they have been worst affected since last year due to Covid’s impact on the economy. While they admit that a lockdown or extension of curfew for a few days is essential at this juncture, but added that the government should support businesses.Atul Bhargava, president of New Delhi Traders Association (of Connaught Place), said, “It is the need of the hour. We have called a meeting tomorrow to discuss the issue, as the situation is very grim. But we want to say that the government should support traders, who have been at the receiving end due to the economic slowdown..”The Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) has written to Delhi L-G Anil Baijal, requesting a 15-day lockdown in the city. Praveen Khandelwal, secretary general of CAIT, said, “A lockdown of at least 15 days should be imposed in Delhi with immediate effect. It is true that this will definitely affect business and economic activities of Delhi, but now life of the people has to be put first.”The resident welfare associations, too, demanded a lockdown. Atul Goyal, president of URJA (a group of RWAs in Delhi), said, “The situation is grim and people are struggling to get their loved ones admitted to hospitals, for basic supply of medicines and oxygen, etc. The situation is worse than last year. A lockdown for 10-14 days is the only solution at the moment.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/highlevel-meeting-today-to-decide-on-extension-of-curfew-traders-bodies-to-take-call-on-markets-shut-down-101618771647985.html
19-04-2021||Delhi||2 hospitals booked for turning away patients despite available beds||Acting on complaints by the state government, Delhi police on Sunday booked two hospitals for allegedly denying admission to Covid patients despite showing availability of beds on the Delhi Corona app.While the Delhi government did not reveal the names of the hospitals, police said they have registered a case against the Mata Chanan Devi Hospital in west Delhi and Hakeem Abdul Hameed Centenary Hospital in south Delhi.Prashant Priya Gautam, additional deputy commissioner of police (west), said a case under IPC sections of cheating and disobedience to an order passed by a government servant, and relevant sections of Delhi Disaster Management Act was registered against Mata Chanan Devi hospital on the complaint of district authorities.Also read: Local doctor to take charge of Covid-19 centres in societiesA statement released by the government said, “These hospitals put out information saying that they have Covid-19 beds, but later denied patients saying no beds were available... After Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal’s directions that stern action be taken against hospitals putting out wrong information about availability of beds, the Delhi government has sought legal action against two hospitals.”Gautam said a police team visited Mata Chanan Devi hospital after a complaint from the Delhi government. “At the hospital, the team inquired from the emergency ward and at the help desk about beds for Covid patients, but were told there weren’t any available. However, when we checked the Delhi Corona portal, it showed 93 beds were available,” said Gautam.When HT contacted the hospital over phone, a doctor attributed the miscommunication to a technical glitch.At Hakeem Abdul Hameed Centenary Hospital, police sent in a decoy to verify the complaint. “The hospital said there was no bed available but the Delhi Corona app showed 239 free beds,” said DCP Thakur. The hospital couldn’t be reached for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/2-hospitals-booked-for-denying-admission-to-covid-patients-despite-free-beds-listed-on-app-101618771587613.html

Normally, a maximum of 15 bodies are cremated at the ground in a day, the official said.The official said 46 bodies arrived on Thursday, 49 on Friday, 47 on Saturday.State control room data shows that a total of 106 people in Ghaziabad have died of Covid-related causes since March 2020.An HT team visited the cremation site on Sunday and found that workers deployed by the corporation were constructing new cremation platforms on the footpath where several cremations took place on Friday. Like Saturday, fresh charred remains were also spotted on the pavement on Sunday.The HT team saw about eight new cremation platforms being constructed on the riverbed.Ghaziabad district magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey did not respond to requests for comment despite repeated phone calls.Also read: NH9 lane towards Meerut to be opened at Ghazipur border for ambulancesGhaziabad’s chief medical officer Dr NK Gupta said most of the bodies being cremated at the Hindon ground were coming from outside the district. “Most of the people who have succumbed in Ghaziabad are from outside the district and they generally arrive here when their condition becomes critical. Once a patient dies, the bodies are not allowed to be taken to their homes as per protocol. Also, the time taken for cremation of one body is 4-5 hours due to Covid protocols, resulting in delays,” Dr Gupta. He added that the two people who died on Sunday were admitted in Santosh Medical College.MS Tanwar, Ghaziabad municipal commissioner, said, “The electric crematorium was out of order and repairs were taken up. It is functional now. We have deployed a team of officers at the site to ensure all arrangements are in place. The situation is normal now and not extraordinary.”An official, requesting anonymity, said the new platforms were being constructed to meet “future exigencies”.“The nine existing platforms at the cremation ground will also be revamped,” the officer said. However, the officer claimed, most families try to avoid the existing platforms since they believe that these are in “wrong direction” and in “wrong shape”, considering them inauspicious.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/furnaces-full-hindon-cremation-ground-gets-new-platforms-on-footpath-101618771287386.html
19-04-2021||Delhi||To bolster health system, city private hospitals to add 2,100 Covid-19 beds||The Delhi government on Sunday directed private hospitals and nursing homes that provide Covid patient care in the Capital to reserve at least 80% of their ward and ICU beds for Covid-19 patients. It also directed Delhi government-run Covid-19 hospitals to increase their bed capacities. The state government said the directives will increase the total Covid-19 ward beds by 3,875 and ICU beds by 1,126.Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia also inspected a few hospitals and Covid Care Centres where beds will be added in the coming days.In the first order on Sunday, the Delhi government noted that all 115 private hospitals and nursing homes catering to Covid patients are running at full capacity. “It has been observed that occupancy of Covid ICU beds and Covid ward beds have almost reached 100% and 90% respectively in the 115 private hospitals providing Covid-19 related treatment. Therefore, to further augment the bed capacity for Covid-19 patients, all nursing homes and private hospitals providing Covid related treatment are directed to reserve at least 80% of their ICU bed capacity and 80% of ward bed capacity for Covid related treatment and display the revised Covid-19 bed capacity (ward and ICU) on the Covid-19 data management portal immediately,” said the order, a copy of which HT has seen.Currently, as per a series of orders issued earlier this month, there are 14 private hospitals in the city which cumulatively have 3,553 Covid-19 beds. These hospitals were asked to convert themselves into 100% Covid-19 facilities last week but the order was revised to allow increasing the total bed capacity and offer the surplus beds for non-Covid patients. In addition to this, 19 private hospitals have already reserved 80% beds for Covid-19 patients while the remaining 86 facilities were reserving only 60% of their beds for Covid patients.Also read: 2 hospitals booked for turning away patients despite available bedsThe order will help add 1,896 ward beds and 211 ICU beds in private hospitals, said a senior government official.Prominent Covid-19 private hospitals in the city include Max Superspeciality Hospital, Indraprastha Apollo Hospital, BL Kapoor Hospital, Sir Gangaram Hospital, Jaipur Golden Hospital, Fortis Hospital and Primus Superspeciality Hospital.In the second order, the health department directed the 11 Delhi government-run Covid-19 hospitals – including Lok Nayak Hospital, GTB Hospital, Rajiv Gandhi Superspeciality Hospital and Ambedkar Nagar Hospital – to increase their total ward beds by 1,979 and ICU beds by 915. However, 696 of the additional 915 ICU beds in these hospitals will not be equipped with ventilators, said the order, a copy of which HT has seen.As on Sunday evening, 14,668 of 17,792 total Covid beds and 4,042 of 4,139 ICU beds were occupied in the capital.The orders to augment the number of beds were issued soon after Kejriwal expressed concerns over shortage of oxygen supply, ICU beds and ward beds in the Capital, while noting that the city recorded around 25,500 new cases in 24 hours and the positivity rate increased to around 30% from 24% recorded the previous day.He also said the Delhi government will add more than 6,000 Covid-19 beds with oxygen facilities in the next few days in locations including health facilities at the Yamuna Sports Complex, the Commonwealth Games (CWG) village, the Radhasaomi Satsang Beas campus in Chhatarpur as well as in a few government schools.Later, he visited the CWG Village, Yamuna Sports complex and a government school in Rouse Avenue. “As many as 1,500 oxygen beds will be functional between tomorrow and the day after in these places,” he said.Sisodia visited the Satsang campus in Chhatarpur, DRDO’s Covid-19 hospital near Delhi airport, and a few other hospitals. The Chhatarpur centre will have 5,000 oxygen beds, of which 500 will be operational from Tuesday, Sisodia said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/to-augment-covid-care-govt-orders-pvt-facilities-to-reserve-80-beds-increase-capacity-of-govt-hospitals-101618771168136.html

Senior officers said the “prompt move” helped “save the lives of at least 35 Covid patients admitted at the hospital”.Additional commissioner of police (outer) Sudhanshu Dhama said the director of the hospital, Rajesh Dabas, told them there were 35 Covid patients on oxygen support at the hospital.Also read: CM flags Delhi’s ‘oxygen emergency’, writes to Centre“Dabas said that the oxygen supply at the hospital is depleting and the available oxygen supply will not last more than one hour.

19-04-2021||Delhi||College students in Delhi reluctant to go home||With higher education institutes in Delhi advising hostel residents to return home, several students have expressed concerns over travelling to their hometowns, worried they may become carriers of the infection, as several states report sharp spikes in Covid-19 cases.Last week, Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) and the Indian Institute of Technology - Delhi (IIT-D) advised students to return home in the wake of rising cases on campus.While JNU had 64 active cases on campus till Friday, IIT-D recorded 30 cases in the past month. Delhi University’s Gwyer Hostel — which accommodates masters and research scholars — also reported a few cases among students. DU’s examination branch has also been shut till Wednesday in the wake of rising cases.Shivam Chaurasia, a PhD scholar at JNU’s School of Social Sciences and a resident of Sutlej hostel, said, “The administration had issued a similar advisory in March last year, after which several students returned home. But now there is a concern among them. They know that if they leave, it might take some time for them to return to campus, which will affect their work.”On Sunday, the Akhil Bhartiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) also wrote to the JNU administration on the matter. Chaurasia, who is also president of ABVP’s JNU unit, said they have asked for isolation and permanent testing centres on campus, along with thermal screening and provisions for sanitisation at entry points. “There is no temperature-check facility at the main gate or at the gates of the hostels, nor are there any sanitiser dispensers,” the group wrote in the letter.Also read: Oxford starts first study to reinfect recovered Covid-19 patientsMadhurima Kundu, a MPhil student and a resident of JNU’s Chandrabhaga hostel, said, “Some students have decided to go back, but a majority don’t want to, because they went back last year and got stuck at home. This circular does not specify how students are supposed to deal with online education in the absence of internet facilities, electricity, and privacy at their homes.”“Every state is witnessing a surge in cases. This time, a lot of young people have tested positive for Covid-19 and have had to be hospitalised as well. It is not safe to travel in such a scenario because we also run the risk of infecting our families back home. Not many have the option to isolate in their homes,” said a third-year student at IIT-D who asked not to be named.In Jamia Millia Islamia meanwhile, though hostels are yet to reopen after being shut last year, several students who returned to the Capital to access university resources are now in a fix.“I rented a room so that I could access the university library, e-resources and laboratory facilities. But with the administration now advising students to remain in their homes, it may affect my research work. With the increase in cases, there is a fear that we may not be allowed to access labs completely,” said Khalid Imtiyaz, a PhD scholar at the university.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/after-colleges-advise-residents-to-return-home-students-flag-travel-fears-101618771107344.html

The police were present at the crossings but did not question those moving with a purpose,” stated Smiti Chobey, a passenger who got down from the train to reach Agra. However, the police remained strict for compliance with the weekend lockdown and did not allow shops of non-essential items to open. The impact could be witnessed in towns and rural belt as well where markets and offices remained closed. The police remained alert at most of the places.The essential services like medical shops were open and supply of milk was also maintained.In Mathura and Vrindavan, prominent temples remained closed on Sunday. “The temple of Dwarkadeesh in Mathura will remain closed till 25th of April,” informed manager and spokesperson of the temple, Rakesh Tiwari. The renowned Bankey Behari Temple in Vrindavan also remained closed on Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/agra-witnesses-empty-roads-downed-shutters-on-sunday-101618771048420.html

With his oxygen saturation steadily dropping, the family’s doctor advised them to put the patient on oxygen support. But this proved to be yet another harrowing experience for the family.“It has been a struggle to arrange for oxygen cylinders or concentrators. A few hospitals told us a few beds may free up in a day or two. But till then, we have to manage the patient at home,” Marwah said.The GK-1 resident welfare association (RWA) then stepped in, providing her with an oxygen concentrator. The association has maintained two oxygen concentrators and three cylinders since last year for Covid-19 patients. But with cases spiralling to unforeseen levels, and hospitals running out of beds and oxygen, RWAs like the one in GK-1 have found it near impossible to meet the ever-soaring demand for oxygen. As many as 25,462 Covid-19 cases were recorded on Sunday breaching the previous high of 24,375 cases recorded the previous day. On Sunday, 161 people reportedly died of the infection. Out of the 17, 514 beds reserved for Covid-19 patients, 13,887 beds were occupied. Health experts recommend that Covid-19 patients get hospitalised if their oxygen saturation is below 94mm. However, with facilities packed, experts say patients should be given oxygen therapy at home if possible.Dr Vikas Maurya, director and head of pulmonology, Fortis Healthcare, Shalimar Bagh, said, “Given the surge in Covid-19 cases and demand for hospital beds, it is advisable for patients to take oxygen therapy or support at home till they get admission in hospital. Oxygen saturation below 94 means that there is lung involvement and patients should start looking to get hospitalised. A level below 90 is a cause of concern.” Referring to the situation in the city, Dr Maurya said, “The sudden increase in Covid-19 cases has burdened the health care infrastructure. We are asking patients to start the treatment at home and use oxygen till they get a hospital bed.”RWAs said the shortage of oxygen cylinders and concentrators at the domestic and level had, in turn, forced people to rush to hospitals.Sanjay Anand, president of the GK-1 E-block RWA, said, “In the past few days, the demand for oxygen equipment has increased several times. We have kept these machines as a stopgap arrangement. We will get the cylinders refilled as soon as possible so that we can provide basic support to our residents.”Similarly, Aarohan Mediratta, whose relative tested positive for Covid-19, had to borrow the machine from the GK-I RWA. “I called up all possible vendors but in vain. There are no machines available. We needed it urgently, because the patient’s oxygen level dropped to 80,” said Mediratta.An oxygen concentrator pulls in air from the surroundings, compresses it and removes nitrogen and other impurities from the air through its filters. The machine costs somewhere between ₹50,000- ₹70,000. Several people across the city either rented the machine or bought one entirely last year.But distributors say they have now run out of these machines. NS Sethi, a city-based distributor, said, “I don’t have any machine right now, but I get at least 50 calls a day asking for one. We import these machines from China, the United States and other countries.”Similarly, the demand for oxygen cylinders has increased exponentially. “We are getting requests from hospitals, nursing homes and individuals. But we have no stock [of new cylinders]. We are trying to arrange cylinders. At the moment, we are simply refilling oxygen cylinders,” said Ashish Sharma, owner of Home Health Rental, an oxygen cylinder supplier in west Delhi.Rishipal Singh, an oxygen cylinder supplier in east Delhi, said, “Just 10 days ago, we were supplying 60-70 oxygen cylinders a day. But in the past four to five days, demand has shot up to 150-200 a day, and we have run out of stock.”The weekend lockdown made the situation even worse, vendors said, with the restrictions on movement hampering transport. “We can’t supply it at home due to the demand and shortage of manpower. We have asked some people to come to our centre and get their cylinder refilled,” said a vendor, who asked not to be named.The RWAs requested the state government to step in and collaborate to ease supplies.Rajiv Kakria, convenor of Save Our City campaign, said, “The government should rope in RWAs and provide oxygen cylinders to address the growing demand for it. This will help ease the load on health care infrastructure.”Delhi Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal on Saturday directed district magistrates to tie up with RWAs to create small facilities at the colony level equipped with few beds and oxygen cylinders.Pankaj Aggarwal, president of Safdarjung Enclave RWA, said they were in talks with the district administration to set up a unit in the colony. “This will at least ease people’s anxiety. We have oxygen concentrators and cylinders with us, which are being used by our residents.”Some doctors, however, cautioned that oxygen needs to be administered under proper medical supervision. Dr Sandeep Sharma, former president of the Indian Medical Association (South Delhi) who is assisting the Safdarjung Enclave RWA to set up the centre, said, “Each patient has a different oxygen requirement. It has to be assessed by a doctor before the patient is administered oxygen.”He added, “We see that more and more people are just trying to procure cylinders or concentrators in anticipation. This is just adding to the panic and demand for these items. People should pool in and get these facilities at the block or RWA level.”It is not just RWAs and individuals who are facing problems, hospitals too are facing problems due to short supply of oxygen. In the present scenario, hospitals said that even if they have vacant beds, arranging oxygen is a problem due to shortage of supply.Dr Shekhar Aggarwal, vice-president and executive director of Sant Parmanand hospital, said, “Shortage of oxygen supply is posing a big challenge, as the demand for it has increased manifold. A large number of Covid-19 patients coming to the hospital need oxygen support. Our average oxygen usage till a few days ago was 200-250 cubic meter which has now increased to 1,200-1,500 cubic meter per day.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/covid19-patients-at-home-struggle-to-get-oxygen-as-vendors-flag-increased-demand-101618770987483.html
19-04-2021||Delhi||Local doctor to take charge of Covid-19 centres in societies||The Delhi government on Sunday issued guidelines for gated residential complexes, which want to set up Covid care centres and isolation facilities with the help of resident welfare associations (RWA) and non-government organisations (NGO), noting that such provisions will help reduce the burden on the city’s health care system amid the ongoing surge in infection.The guidelines, a copy of which HT has seen, state that a doctor residing in the residential area concerned or one engaged by the RWA or NGO should act as the medical officer of such a facility and each patient will have to be clinically assessed for symptoms. The medical officer will also be entrusted with monitoring the health of each patient round the clock, even though there will be routine inspections by district medical officers and surveillance officers, said the guideline document.The guidelines bar the use of such facilities for patients with moderate and severe symptoms, the elderly, children below the age of 10 years, pregnant women, lactating mothers and patients with comorbidities. The guidelines further said that such facilities cannot allow “intermixing” of suspect and confirmed cases and each of them have to be mandatorily linked to the district surveillance teams and at least one ambulance service provider, the document said.Further, it states that such centres can be set up in community halls, common utility areas and vacant flats which are “location-wise” isolated.The centres need to have separate entry and exit passages, adequate ventilation, ACs to be maintained at the range of 24-30 degrees and relative humidity of 40-70%.There should be separate toilets for suspected and confirmed patients and a mandatory distance of one metre between beds, said the document.“The community living in gated complexes may like to create Covid care facilities within the residential complex, managed either by RWAs and residential societies, or in collaboration with NGOs. This may be more acceptable to the residents and will help reduce the burden on existing facilities for managing suspect, pre-symptomatic, asymptomatic and very mild cases of Covid-19. The guideline document has been prepared to help RWAs, residential societies and NGOs desirous of establishing a small Covid care facility, a community-based isolation facility within their own resources,” said the guideline document.Rajiv Kakria, member of an RWA in Greater Kailash-1, which has several gated colonies, said, “It is a welcome move in the light of the current Covid-19 situation in Delhi. But residential societies should not act in haste. They have to ensure that the centres have the primary facilities such as oxygen cylinders and concentrators, adequate number of doctors, nurses and paramedics to monitor health and the equipment. The finances should be in place as once such a centre is created, it cannot be abandoned suddenly due to lack of funds.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-govt-issues-guidelines-for-covid-care-centres-in-gated-societies-101618770988061.html
19-04-2021||Lucknow||Lucknow: ASHA workers again at forefront combating Covid-19||The Accredited Social Health Activist (ASHA) who played a pivotal role in the screening and providing medical services to people residing in the rural areas, during the first wave of Covid, are again at the forefront after the state government issued an order on Thursday for screening and monitoring the migrant workers who are returning home from various states.A health department officer said 1.54 lakh ASHA workers in the villages have been assigned the task of screening the migrant workers staying at quarantine centres set up in the villages or the home quarantine.The ASHA workers have been directed to prepare a list of the migrant workers who have returned home and also to register their health conditions. If any migrant worker is found with Covid symptoms then the ASHA workers will alert the nearest health centre, ensure that the infected migrant remains in isolation and their family members adopt all precautionary measures, he said.However, a large number of ASHA workers complained that they have not been given basic protective gears and sanitiser for their protection from Covid-19 that is crucial during the field visits. Besides, no payment is being made for the survey work even their monthly remuneration is also pending.Chanda Yadav, an ASHA worker based in Gorakhpur said the ASHA workers across Uttar Pradesh were assisting the state government in the Covid vaccination drive, routine immunization, nutrition distribution, taking care of pregnant women and newborns. After the fresh order by the state government, the ASHA workers are visiting villages to screen the migrant workers and enlisting them as well. Despite the high infection rate, we have not been provided protective gear, dress kits and sanitisers. We have been handed over a mask and were told to visit the villages, she said.The state is in the grip of the major Covid surge, yet the ASHA workers are in the field preparing the list of the migrant workers, they are also sending details of their health condition, but the local officers are not concerned about our safety. Several ASHA workers have been infected and their family members have urged the health department to arrange for the treatment and hospital admission, said Yadav who is also president of the ASHA workers association.Pushpa Devi, an ASHA worker based in Lalitpur district said a majority of the ASHA workers come from poor or low-income group families, the state health department has not cleared the monthly remuneration, and we are being forced to work without pay. Earlier we were entrusted in the care of the mother and child now we are roped in with all the health and welfare schemes launched in the rural areas. We have urged the state government to make a fixed monthly payment but there is no taker of our genuine demands, she said.A state government official said the Uttar Pradesh unit of the National Health Mission (NHM) has been directed to clear the arrears of the ASHA workers and to provide them with protective gears and gadgets for the field visit.ACS, health and family welfare, Amit Mohan Prasad said the ASHA workers have been directed to visit the house of the quarantined migrant workers after a gap of three days. With maintaining social distancing, the worker will screen the migrant, collect information from the family members about the health condition. The ASHA worker will ensure that the elderly, pregnant women, children and those with comorbidity remain in separate rooms, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/lucknow-asha-workers-again-at-forefront-combating-covid-101618770867337.html
19-04-2021||Pune||Lower case fatality rate, but rate of recovery same as 2020: experts||Though the rate of recovery among critical patients during the second wave of the Covid pandemic in Pune is the same as compared to last year, the case fatality rate (CFR) is lower, said health experts. Early intervention, according to these experts, and timely treatment from hospitals, has helped with recovery. A deeper correlation though can be seen only after a few more days have passed, said doctors. As per the health department, the CFR in Pune city for the month of April is 1.81 per cent. In May 2020, the CFR was 4.62% and it came down to 2.39 % in August-September, as per the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) and district administration. According to Dr Kapil Zirpe, chief intensivist at Ruby Hall Clinic, for critical patients at his hospital the recovery rate is around 60 per cent. “The mortality rate for critical patients varies as per the use of non-invasive ventilation or invasive ventilation. And the recovery rate for critical patients is roughly 60 per cent, not just in Pune but across the world as well,” said Dr Zirpe. At many other hospitals in Pune, severely symptomatic patients are taking more time to recover, though fatalities are fewer, is the observation. “Critical patients take their own time to recover. Early detection and intervention is important and will help patients. In this second wave, the younger population is getting more infected and in many cases, the younger population is healthy and they don’t seek early detection and intervention. Elderly citizens are now more aware because of the first wave, so they seek early treatment,” said Dr Zirpe. In Pune, the overall recovery rate as of Sunday was 82.91%, while the same for Maharashtra has been 81.18%, as per the health department. Dr Sanjeev Wavare, assistant chief of health at the PMC, said that without ventilation, critical patients’ recovery rate is 60 per cent. “During the second wave, critical patients with ventilation have recovered at the rate of 60 per cent rate. This is lower than the previous wave. It depends on the patient as well and early detection and intervention plays an important role,” said Wavare Dr Murlidhar Tambe, dean of BJ General Medical College and Sassoon General Hospital, said that the CFR is low as many patients are seeking early treatment. “Many patients are aware of the symptoms now and are seeking early medical help, which helps them recover faster,” said Dr Tambe. Dr Dhananjay Kelkar, medical director of Deenanath Mangeshkar Hospital, said that the recovery rate is the same as the last time. “However, the patient inflow this time is more than the last wave. The number of patients is large. Patients coming to the hospital have increased, but otherwise, all the patterns of illness are the same,” said Dr Kelkar. He added that if there is no hypoxia, there will be no severe treatment. “If the patient doesn’t have a shortage of oxygen and other symptoms, then they should be isolated at home. As soon as there is hypoxia, patients should seek medical treatment immediately. Only in case of hypoxia, patients are in need of rigorous treatment. Otherwise the treatment is normal,” said Dr Kelkar. He also added that there are a lot of post-Covid symptoms that are observed among patients. “Last time, more senior citizens tested positive. However, this time either the old have been infected or are vaccinated, so their numbers are less. Transmissibility this time is much more than the last wave. As a result we are seeing the entire family getting the infection and many infected are younger in age,” said Kelkar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/lower-case-fatality-rate-but-rate-of-recovery-same-as-2020-experts-101618761146853.html
19-04-2021||Pune||Daily wage workers at construction sites struggle to make ends meet||As the smaller construction sites in Pune are shut due to Covid-19 related restrictions, daily wage workers looking for employment at labour pick-up points (Majur addas) in the city are finding it difficult to survive. At the same time, big construction sites are operating uninterrupted as the government has allowed the functioning of in-situ sites. The labour pick-up points at Hadapsar, Warje and Bhosari continues to have a footfall of more than 200 workers every day. “Government has given permission to continue work at big sites, but in the city, there are many small works undertaken like – construction of gardens in housing societies or constructing a compound wall and for such small work how should we arrange accommodation for the workers. There should have been some relaxation for daily wage workers so it could have benefited all,” said Jagan Ram, a contractor who provides daily jobs to workers in Hadapsar. In and around Pune around 1.5 lakh plus workers are engaged in construction work. However, the exact data about this figure is not available. Credai Pune Metro is currently collating data of all workers above 45 years age for the purpose of free vaccination as per government norms. Ranjit Naiknavare, vice president, Credai Pune Metro said, “It is difficult to give an exact number of the under-constructionsites. Most of the projects on the outskirts of Pune, including PMRDA and extended limits are large size developments and most of them have in-situ labour camps. Even the sites inside city limits have facilities for labour camps. Most of the construction sites are running and developers, especially the Credai members are trying their best to take good care of construction workers by providing full wages, stay, groceries, medical and sanitation facilities, isolation rooms wherever possible.” According to Credai, most of the under-construction sites are functioning to some extent as on date. The order has also impacted residents in many localities as they are not allowed to call workers for renovation work. “I have to change the floor carpet of my house. If there was a relaxation for such work then my society members would have allowed renovation work at my house,” said Rohan Patil, Sunita Parks, Kothrud. The situation is gruesome for some workers as they don’t even have money to return back home. “I earn ₹500 per day. For the last three days, I have earned nothing. Even if I plan to visit my hometown in Gaya, Bihar, I don’t have money to get a railway ticket. What work will I do there is another problem. We are ready to undergo Covid test, but we should be allowed to work,” said Vikal Shinde, who works as a labourer at Hadapsar. Sanjay Hiwrale, who works as labourer at Yerawada said, “For the last seven years I have been working on construction sites. Today I went to work at Vishrantwadi with six other workers and we were sent back by police as we don’t have accommodation on the site. Even our site engineer had no option, but to stop the work. If I don’t have work for 15 days, then it becomes difficult to pay rents and electric bills.” Anita Lashkare, a daily wage worker, said, “Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) is not doing anything for daily wage workers. According to the 2018 GR from the state government, if a person has worked for more than 90 days in a year then they should be registered with the Board of Construction Workers (BCOW), but PMC has not given any such certificates to us until now.” The state government has announced a transfer of ₹1,500 to construction workers registered with BOCW. “While welfare provisions of BOCW partly compensates it and provides basic social security net to such workers, the inaction by PMC obstructs the process condemning these workers to misery,” said B Youvraj, social activist, New Socialist Alternative.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/daily-wage-workers-at-smaller-construction-sites-struggle-financially-101618759706874.html
19-04-2021||Pune||Father murders daughters before killing himself in Maval||A 40-year-old man was booked for running over his two teen daughters with his truck before jumping out in front of the moving truck himself in the early hours of Sunday in Maval area of Pune, according to the police. The man and the two girls have all been reported dead on the spot. The incident was witnessed by the mother of the two girls, according to the police. The deceased were identified as Bharat Dnyandeo Bharate (40), Nandini Bharat Bharate (18), and Vaishnavi Bharat Bharate (14), all residents of Alfanagari area of Induri village in Maval taluka of Pune. “We first got information about the accident of two sisters. Then we realised that the father is dead too. So, we started asking questions to the witnesses and their mother, who was in shock, who slowly was comprehensive and revealed the series of events to us. It took us a long time to plausibly verify these details. Prima facie, it looks like he crushed them and then managed to jump out of the moving vehicle and then jump ahead of the truck so it would run him over too,” said senior police inspector Pradeep Londhe of Talegaon MIDC police station. A complaint in the matter was lodged by Sapna Bharate (36), wife of the deceased man and mother of the two girls who had started working in a nearby factory 6-7 days ago, according to the police. The man had written a letter detailing his intentions to finish his entire family and had made his wife sign it too, according to the police. The decision is suspected to be a fallout of recent phone conversation he had found between a boy and his elder daughter who was a student of Class 12, according to the complaint. “He then found out about some communication on the phone of his elder daughter in Saturday evening and he had been upset with all of them since then. He had beaten up the elder daughter around 4-5pm on Saturday. He wrote in his letter that he was ending his family and that nobody should be held responsible for it. He had forced his wife to sign it and she had signed it without reading,” said PI Londhe. The complainant allegedly heard the truck start after 1am on Sunday and went out to check what the source of it was at that hour, according to her complaint. “She says that it was then that she saw the two girls scared and in front of the truck and he was asking her to join them while threatening them with consequences if they got up from there. As he started to move the truck, she went to call her relatives who came out and found his body at some distance from the girls’ and the truck at some 50-70meters ahead of his body,” said PI Londhe. It was during further investigation that the police found a letter in the house. A case under Sections 302 (murder) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of Indian Penal Code was registered at Talegaon MIDC police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/father-murders-daughters-before-killing-himself-in-maval-101618759586939.html
19-04-2021||Pune||PMC using lockdown to complete repairs, civic works across city||The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) is utilising the restriction imposed by the state government to carry out major civic work on otherwise heavily crowded roads in Pune. The work mainly includes laying of water and drainage lines on Laxmi road, Tilak road, Shivaji road, Bajirao road and Swargate area. Due to heavy traffic on these stretches, the PMC often faces problems to carry out major civic work. Now, with the roads deserted due to the Covid induced restrictions, PMC is not facing any people interference and traffic problems as per the chain order. On Laxmi road and Tilak road, the PMC has dug up in the middle of the stretch to lay water pipeline and complete the work within one week. Earlier during the previous lockdown, the Pune Metropolitan Regional Development Authority (PMRDA) had demolished Savitribai Phule Pune University junction flyover for the proposed Shivajinagar –Hinjewadi Metro corridor. The demolition work was completed within a month without any hurdle to traffic because of lockdown. Nandkumar Jagatap, superintendent engineer of PMC water supply department said, “We have started laying of the water pipe line in the old city areas like Laxmi road, Tilak road, Shivaji road. Due to the break the chain order and restrictions, contractors are working without traffic hurdles throughout the day. It will complete before the monsoon.” According to Jagtap, in the old city areas, narrow roads, traffic congestion, crowds are some of the major problems to carry out the work in daylight. Police also do not allow PMC to undertake such work. “Now we don’t have to face such problems. We are working in full swing in daylight. If we want to work in a normal situation, it would have taken more than a month of complete work and people would have faced problems. The situation would be chaotic one and we would have to work at night due to traffic and people movement. Now, we will complete work within 15 days without any congestion,” he added. VG kulkarni, chief superintendent engineer of roads said, “We have given permission to the drainage department to carry out the pipe line work at Shivaji road, Tilak road, Bajirao road and Volga chowk ( Swargate area), City pride chowk ( Market yard area). We are able to complete the work at a faster pace due to the weekend lockdown and break the chain order.” According to PMC officials, permission is required from the traffic police department to start any development work on the busy roads. It takes time and traffic police put conditions and give time slots to work. Normally, police give permission to work at night to avoid any congestion and noise pollution. Police will have to divert traffic to avoid congestion and minimise the trouble of citizens. Due to the weekend lockdown and break the chain order, police have not objected to any works.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pmc-using-lockdown-to-complete-civic-works-across-city-101618759526802.html
19-04-2021||World||‘Long-term focus’: European Union unveils strategy for cooperation in Indo-Pacific||The European Union on Monday unveiled a strategy to reinforce its presence and actions in the Indo-Pacific, including cooperation with regional partners for maritime security and deepening of economic ties with India. The move follows the adoption of Indo-Pacific strategies by key EU members such as France, Germany and the Netherlands. All these policies envisage closer security and economic cooperation with India, which is seen as a key player in the region. “The aim is to contribute to regional stability, security, prosperity and sustainable development, at a time of rising challenges and tensions in the region,” the European Council, which sets the EU’s policy agenda, said in a statement on the Indo-Pacific strategy. “The renewed EU commitment to the Indo-Pacific, a region spanning from the east coast of Africa to the Pacific island states, will have a long-term focus and will be based on upholding democracy, human rights, the rule of law and respect for international law,” it said. The development also comes against the backdrop of concerns among EU members about the aggressive and assertive actions of China across the Indo-Pacific. However, the EU has opted to strike a fine line between cooperating with China on issues such as trade and investment and climate change and challenging its actions that go against a rules-based order. The EU will develop partnerships in security and defence, including addressing maritime security, malicious cyber activities, disinformation, emerging technologies, terrorism, and organised crime, the statement said. The strategy, adopted during a meeting of the European Council on April 16, said the EU will “continue to explore deepening economic relations with India”. This will be part of efforts to strengthen the EU’s strategic trade position in the Indo-Pacific following significant regional agreements such as the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) and the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP). Without naming China, the European Council also said the current dynamics in the Indo-Pacific “have given rise to the intense geopolitical competition adding to increasing tensions on trade and supply chains as well as in technological, political and security areas”. Human rights are also being challenged, and these developments “increasingly threaten the stability and security of the region and beyond, directly impacting on the EU’s interests,” it said. The EU’s approach will foster a rules-based international order, a level playing field and an open and fair environment for trade and investment, the strengthening of resilience, and supporting connectivity with the EU. “Free and open maritime supply routes in full compliance with international law remain crucial. The EU will look to work together with its partners in the Indo-Pacific on these issues of common interest,” the European Council said. The EU and its regional partners will also work together to mitigate the economic and human effects of the Covid-19 pandemic and ensure an inclusive and sustainable socio-economic recovery. In the realm of security and defence, the EU will protect critical maritime routes through capacity building for partners to improve their maritime domain awareness, and organise more joint exercises and port calls between Indo-Pacific naval units and the EU counter-piracy Naval Force Operation Atalanta. The EU will also strengthen cooperation with partners on counter-terrorism, cyber-security, maritime security and crisis management, and a “meaningful European naval presence in the Indo-Pacific” is seen as important for the future.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/longterm-focus-european-union-unveils-strategy-for-cooperation-in-indopacific-101618854272909.html

They don't hesitate in getting physical with us," another officer told the French president.Security has become a top political issue in France 12 months ahead of the presidential election.In a interview with the right-wing Le Figaro newspaper on Sunday, Macron acknowledged that physical assaults had increased."Since 2017, even though France has seen a fall of between 18-25 percent in violent thefts, burglaries and vehicle theft, it has had a major increase in physical assaults," he said.Macron singled out the rise in violence against police officers, firefighters and medics as being of particular concern.He has promised to honour a target of recruiting 10,000 extra police officers by 2022 and his government has drafted controversial new legislation aimed at protecting and reinforcing the police.Several recent crimes have shocked the country.Alain Francon, one of France's most prolific theatre directors, was stabbed in the throat near his hotel in central Montpellier in March by a man who told police he objected to Francon looking at him.In January, a 15-year-old schoolboy was left in a coma after being repeatedly kicked by a gang in a well-heeled neighbourhood of the capital in an assault that captured national media attention for days.Earlier this month, 78-year-old tycoon Bernard Tapie was tied up with electrical cords along with his wife during a violent overnight robbery at their home outside Paris.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/french-police-warn-prez-emmanuel-macron-about-rising-levels-of-street-violence-101618853424396.html

They will then have follow-up appointments and be monitored for a year."This study has the potential to transform our understanding by providing high-quality data," said Shobana Balasingam, vaccines senior research advisor at Wellcome.The trial's initial phase will look at the minimum dose that allows the virus to start replicating without symptoms in some 50 percent of volunteers.Then in the second phase, another group of volunteers will all receive this established minimum dose.The trial comes as a London hospital has isolated a group of healthy volunteers while exposing them to the virus, in a world first.That began in March and is being carried out in collaboration between Imperial College London and the company hVIVO at the Royal London Hospital.Those who have been infected in a controlled way are monitored to see how their illness progresses and how drugs and vaccines could work against it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/oxford-university-launches-trial-to-reinfect-volunteers-who-have-had-covid19-101618850358869.html
19-04-2021||World||Dozens of Turks sneak into Europe in passport scam: Report||The Turkish government on Monday widened an investigation into claims dozens of people had used special passports to enter Europe legally and never returned.The scandal has dominated local headlines since it emerged last week that 43 people with grey service passports entered Germany last November to attend an environmental workshop and never returned to Turkey.Grey passports are issued to people working abroad for the state, allowing visa-free travel to many countries.They were sent by a local district municipality in the eastern province of Malatya, according to local media.The interior ministry in a statement on Monday said the probe would be widened to include six more local municipalities in cities including Ordu on the Black Sea.The six included ruling and main opposition party mayors.They had sent individuals for "folk dance shows, culture tours, youth programmes" in cooperation with non-governmental organisations, the interior ministry said.It also temporarily suspended issuing service-stamped passports for non-public sector employees who were assigned to work abroad by local authorities.Last week, the ministry suspended the deputy governor of Malatya, two public officials and the provincial head of the population and citizen affairs body over the scandal.One source told HaberTurk website how people paid 6,000 euros ($7,200) for the passport to go to Germany through Bingol municipality in eastern Turkey.They also claimed at least "450-500" people went to Europe using this method.In a video posted online by Anka News Agency, the main opposition party mayor of Yesilova in southwestern Turkey said the claims relating to his district dated back to 2018, before he was elected.Mumtaz Senel said 387 people were sent to Rome with grey passports but 23 never returned their passports.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dozens-of-turks-sneak-into-europe-in-passport-scam-report-101618848253009.html
19-04-2021||World||A look at high-profile cases over killings by US police||Former Minneapolis police Officer Derek Chauvin is charged with murder and manslaughter in George Floyd's death after pressing his knee into Floyd's neck as he cried out: “I can't breathe.”The defense argued that Chauvin, a white 19-year veteran, used reasonable force and that Floyd died because of his illegal drug use and underlying health problems.It has been rare to charge police with crimes in the death of civilians, and winning a conviction is harder in part because juries are often reluctant to second guess an officer’s split-second decisions. But Chauvin's knee was on Floyd's neck for 9 1/2 minutes, prosecutors say, as bystanders shouted at the officer to get off Floyd.Here's a look at other high-profile killings by police and the outcome of the case:ERIC GARNEREric Garner, 43, died in July 2014 in New York City after a white officer placed him in a chokehold when Garner refused to be handcuffed for allegedly selling loose, untaxed cigarettes. A Staten Island grand jury declined to indict Officer Daniel Pantaleo in December that year. The Justice Department said in 2019 that it wouldn't file civil rights charges after a yearslong investigation.MICHAEL BROWNMichael Brown, 18, was fatally shot by a white officer, Darren Wilson, in August 2014 in Ferguson, Missouri, touching off weeks of sometimes-violent protests. A St. Louis County grand jury declined in November 2014 to indict Wilson in the unarmed Black teen's death, and the U.S. Department of Justice later also declined to charge him. Wesley Bell, the current St. Louis County prosecuting attorney, conducted a five-month review of witness statements, forensic reports and other evidence and announced in July that he would not charge Wilson.LAQUAN MCDONALDChicago Police Officer Jason Van Dyke shot 16 times at Laquan McDonald, killing the Black 17-year-old as he walked away from officers in October 2014. Van Dyke was charged with first-degree murder the same day the city released the shocking dashcam video of the shooting. Van Dyke was found guilty of second-degree murder in 2018 and sentenced to nearly seven years in prison.TAMIR RICETamir Rice, 12, was fatally shot by a white Cleveland police officer in November 2014 after officers responded to a 911 call from a man drinking beer and waiting for a bus who said a “guy” was pointing a gun at people. Tamir, who was Black, had a pellet gun tucked in his waistband and was shot after the officers’ cruiser skidded to a stop just feet away. A grand jury in December 2015 declined to indict patrolman Timothy Loehmann, who fired the fatal shot, and training officer Frank Garmback. The U.S. Justice Department announced last year that it would not bring federal criminal charges, saying the quality of video of the shooting was too poor for prosecutors to conclusively establish what had happened.WALTER SCOTTMichael Slager, a white South Carolina police officer, shot Walter Scott in the back as the unarmed 50-year-old Black man fled following a 2015 traffic stop. In 2016, a mistrial was declared after the jury deadlocked over a verdict in Slager's murder trial. The next year, Slager pleaded guilty in federal court to violating Scott’s civil rights and as part of a plea deal, prosecutors dropped state murder charges. Slager was sentenced to 20 years in prison. He is now appealing his punishment, saying his lawyer never told him about a plea offer from prosecutors that could have cut years off his sentence.FREDDIE GRAYFreddie Gray, a 25-year-old Black man, died after he suffered a spinal injury while handcuffed and shackled in a Baltimore police van, sparking weeks of unrest across the city. Three officers were acquitted and prosecutors dropped the remaining state cases in July 2016. The U.S. Department of Justice announced in 2017 that it wouldn't bring federal charges against the six officers involved in the arrest, saying it did not find enough evidence to prove the officers willfully violated Gray's civil rights.PHILANDO CASTILEPhilando Castile, a 32-year-old elementary school cafeteria worker, was shot five times by a St. Anthony, Minnesota police officer during a 2016 traffic stop after Castile informed the officer he was armed. The shooting gained widespread attention after Castile’s girlfriend, who was in the car with her then-4-year-old daughter, livestreamed its gruesome aftermath on Facebook. Officer Jeronimo Yanez testified that Castile was pulling his gun out of his pocket despite commands to do so. The officer was acquitted of manslaughter at trial.JUSTINE RUSZCZYK DAMONDJustine Ruszczyk Damond, an unarmed white dual citizen of the U.S. and Australia, was fatally shot in July 2017 by Minneapolis Police Officer Mohamed Noor when she approached his squad car in the alley behind her home minutes after calling 911 to report a possible rape. Noor testified at trial that a loud bang on the squad car startled him and his partner and that he fired to protect his partner’s life. He was convicted of third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter and sentenced in 2019 to 12 1/2 years in prison.JORDAN EDWARDSRoy Oliver, a white Texas police officer, fired at a car full of teenagers as it drove away from a large house party in April 2017, fatally shooting 15-year-old Jordan Edwards, who was sitting in the front passenger seat. Police initially said the vehicle backed up toward officers “in an aggressive manner,” but later admitted that bodycam video showed the vehicle was moving forward as officers approached. Oliver was convicted of murder in 2018 and sentenced to 15 years in prison.BREONNA TAYLORBreonna Taylor, a 26-year-old Louisville emergency medical worker studying to become a nurse, was shot several times in her hallway after three plainclothes narcotics detectives busted down the door of her apartment in the middle of the night in March 2020. A grand jury brought no charges against officers in her death, although one was indicted for shooting into a neighboring home that had people inside. Prosecutors said two officers who fired at Taylor were justified in using force to protect themselves after they faced gunfire from her boyfriend.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/a-look-at-high-profile-cases-over-killings-by-us-police-101618848205747.html
19-04-2021||World||US sends team to probe fatal Tesla crash with no driver||Federal safety regulators have sent a team to investigate the fatal crash of a Tesla in a Houston suburb in which local authorities say no one was behind the wheel.The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said Monday it has sent a Special Crash Investigation team to Spring, Texas, to look into the Saturday night crash of the electric car.Investigators are “100% sure” that no one was driving the 2019 Tesla Model S that ran off a suburban parkway, hit a tree and burst into flames, killing two men inside, Harris County Precinct Four Constable Mark Herman said.But they're still trying to determine whether the electric car was operating on Tesla's Autopilot driver-assist system, or if the company's “Full Self-Driving Capability” system was in use.One of the men was found in the front passenger seat of the badly burned car, and the other was in the back seat, Herman told The Associated Press Monday.“We are actively engaged with local law enforcement and Tesla to learn more about the details of the crash and will take appropriate steps when we have more information,” NHTSA said Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-sends-team-to-probe-fatal-tesla-crash-with-no-driver-101618847864001.html
19-04-2021||World||UN experts slam UK report for repackaging 'racist tropes'||A body of experts that advises the United Nations on human rights concerns has slammed a widely criticized British government-backed report that concluded there was no systemic racism in the country.The UN Working Group of Experts on People of African Descent said Monday that it found it “stunning” that the report “repackages racist tropes and stereotypes into fact” and urged the British government to reject its findings.“The report cites dubious evidence to make claims that rationalize white supremacy by using the familiar arguments that have always justified racial hierarchy,” the Geneva-based working group said.“This attempt to normalize white supremacy despite considerable research and evidence of institutional racism is an unfortunate sidestepping of the opportunity to acknowledge the atrocities of the past and the contributions of all in order to move forward,” it added.The Commission on Race and Ethnic Disparities, which was set up by British Prime Minister Boris Johnson after last year's Black Lives Matter protests, published its report into racism last month.Its conclusions that Britain is not “institutionally racist” or “rigged” against minorities have been widely vilified, with some critics even arguing that the report downplayed the country’s historic role in slavery.Citing strides to close gaps between ethnic groups in educational and economic achievement, the report said race was becoming “less important” as a factor in creating disparities that are also fueled by class and family backgrounds.Many academics, lawmakers unions and anti-racism activists were skeptical of the findings in the 258-page report, with some claiming the commission ignored barriers to equality, while others said it downplayed the ongoing legacy of Britain’s colonial past as well as its role in slavery.Johnson’s spokesman, Max Blain, said the U.N. working group’s statement “misrepresents the findings” of the U.K. racism report.“This report in no way condones racist behavior, and in fact it highlights that racism and inequality are still problems for our country,” he said.The commission, which was made up of 11 members from a broad cross section of ethnic backgrounds, has also previously defended itself against the charges, arguing that some of the criticism has “tipped into misrepresentation” and that it never argued that racism does not exist in society or in institutions.The U.N. working group also poured scorn on what it described as the report's “mythical representation of enslavement," saying it was "an attempt to sanitize the history of the trade in enslaved Africans."This, it went on, is “a reprehensible, although not unfamiliar tactic, employed by many whose wealth came directly from the enslavement of others, ever since slavery was outlawed.”One of the main clarion calls in last year's Black Lives Matter protests across the U.K. was for the government and institutions to face up to the legacy of the British Empire and the country’s extensive profits from the slave trade.The toppling of a statue of 17th-century slave trader Edward Colston in the city of Bristol in June prompted a pointed debate about how to deal with Britain’s past. Many felt such statues extol racism and are an affront to Black Britons. Others, including the prime minister, argued that removing them was erasing a piece of history.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-experts-slam-uk-report-for-repackaging-racist-tropes-101618834589534.html
19-04-2021||World||South Korea looks to ban internet file-sharing with North Korea||South Korea's government on Monday said it had proposed a law to require its citizens to get official permission before using the internet to exchange digital material such as movies, music, scanned books, or artwork with anyone in North Korea.If approved by parliament, the measure would be the first major amendment to South Korea's Inter-Korean Exchange and Cooperation Act in three decades and is part of its recent efforts to improve relations with North Korea.That law already regulates physical goods sent into or out of North Korea, and the proposed changes would add digital content, Lee Jong-joo, a spokeswoman for South Korea's unification ministry, which handles inter-Korean affairs, told a briefing."While in the past the main target (of the law) was the movement of goods, gradually there have been cases of transferred or received scanned files or software via the internet becoming a focus," Lee said.The revision, first outlined in January, comes after the South in December banned the launching of propaganda leaflets into the North.That measure drew the criticism of rights activists, who have for decades sent anti-North Korean leaflets over the border using balloons or bottles in the sea. It also attracted negative attention from some politicians in the United States, which is South Korea's biggest ally.Last week the Human Rights Commission of the U.S. House of Representatives raised concerns that some measures taken by Seoul may infringe on freedom of expression.Campaigners in South Korea have sent food, medicine, money, mini radios and USB sticks containing South Korean news and dramas, while defectors often try to remain in touch with family members through calls or the internet.Isolated North Korea has long denounced the practice and last year had stepped up its condemnation of it, to the alarm of a South Korean government intent on improving ties on the divided peninsula.When asked whether the ministry was considering restricting radio broadcasts, Lee said such broadcasts are not categorised as a transfer of digital materials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-korea-looks-to-ban-internet-file-sharing-with-north-korea-101618822062088.html
19-04-2021||World||Saudi women's activist Loujain al-Hathloul wins top Europe rights award||Saudi activist Loujain al-Hathloul was awarded a top European rights prize on Monday in recognition of her fight for women's rights in the kingdom, including her efforts to end a ban on women driving.The Vaclav Havel Human Rights Prize, named after the former Czech dissident and later president, is awarded annually for civil society action in defence of human rights by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE).Hathloul "is one of the leaders of the Saudi feminist movement, having campaigned to end the male guardianship system, as well as the Saudi ban on women driving, and for greater protection for women facing abuse in the Kingdom," PACE said in a statement.Hathloul, 31, was detained in May 2018 with about a dozen other female activists -- just weeks before the ban on women driving was lifted.Last December, a court handed Hathloul a prison term of five years and eight months on charges of terrorism-related crimes, but a partially suspended sentence -- and time already served -- led to her early release in February.She remains on probation and is barred from leaving Saudi Arabia for five years. In March, she lost a court appeal against the sentence and the restrictions imposed against her, including the travel ban."International support is the only way we can expose the injustices in my country and protect the victims," her sister Lina said as she accepted the prize and its 60,000 euros ($72,000) at a virtual ceremony."For years now, the Saudi regime has been trying to tarnish her image, to erase any support for her, and to make her forgotten. But the more time passes, the more Loujain proves to the world how incredibly brave, resilient and attached to her values she is," she added.Hathloul's family has alleged the activist experienced torture and sexual harassment in detention, claims that have repeatedly been dismissed by a Saudi court.While some of the activists detained along with Hathloul have been provisionally released, several others remain imprisoned on what campaigners describe as opaque charges.The detentions have cast a spotlight on the human rights record of the kingdom, an absolute monarchy where day-to-day control is widely believed to be in the hands of controversial Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/saudi-women-s-activist-loujain-al-hathloul-wins-top-europe-rights-award-101618840174728.html

Just as with the climate crisis, we must help those who are the most vulnerable first."She said Covax "offers the best path forward to ensure true vaccine equity and a way out of the pandemic".Nearly 900 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines have been injected in at least 206 territories around the world, according to an AFP count.Some 48 percent of the doses have been administered in high-income countries accounting for 16 percent of the global population.Just 0.1 percent have been administered in the 29 lowest-income countries, home to nine percent of the world's population.$2 billion needed The Covax facility ensures the 92 poorest participating economies can access coronavirus jabs, with the cost covered by donors.Since the first shipment landed in Ghana on February 24, Covax has delivered more than 39 million doses to 114 participating territories.Covax is co-led by the WHO, the Gavi vaccine alliance, and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations.The scheme is aiming to distribute enough doses to vaccinate up to 27 percent of the population in the 92 poorest participating economies by the end of the year.The facility on Thursday launched a push for an extra $2 billion in donations, saying it needed the money in advance to reserve Covid vaccine doses throughout the rest of the year.Some $400 million was raised at Thursday's opening donor conference, while Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga will host a Covax funding summit focused on the 92 countries in June.Environment link"Greta Thunberg has inspired millions of people worldwide to take action to address the climate crisis, and her strong support of vaccine equity to fight the Covid-19 pandemic yet again demonstrates her commitment to making our world a healthier, safer and fairer place for all people," said WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus."I urge the global community to follow Greta's example and do what they can, in support of Covax, to protect the world's most vulnerable people from this pandemic."The WHO has consistently made the link between human health, animal health and the health of the planet during the Covid-19 pandemic.The novel coronavirus, which is thought to have made the species jump from the animal world, has now killed more than three million people worldwide since the outbreak emerged in China in December 2019.Thunberg said earlier this month that she plans to skip the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow this November, saying the uneven rollout of Covid vaccine campaigns would mean countries could not participate on even terms.While the climate crisis has been largely overshadowed by the pandemic, COP26 is seen as one of the opportunities to put the climate back on the agenda, following a summit to be hosted this week by US President Joe Biden.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/greta-thunberg-donates-120k-towards-covax-slams-tragedy-of-vaccine-inequity-101618845765487.html
19-04-2021||World||Expulsion of French envoy not a solution to blasphemy in the West: Imran Khan on radical group’s demand||Expulsion of the French ambassador from Pakistan was not a solution to stop the incidences of blasphemy in the western world, Prime Minister Imran Khan said on Monday as the banned radical Islamist party Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) sought the removal of the envoy.Khan’s statement came after his government held talks with the TLP leadership in Lahore following a clash between the supporters of the outfit and the law enforcement agencies a day before in which 11 policemen and Rangers were taken hostage by the radicals. However, the Rangers were released on Monday.Addressing the nation after violent protests across the country, Khan said expelling the French ambassador is not a solution to the problem of blasphemy.“Sending away the French ambassador is not a solution. It will only trigger incidents of blasphemy in other countries as in the West they call it freedom of expression,” he said.He added that snapping ties with France will impact ties with the European Union (EU) because France is among the main nations of the union and the EU will stand with France.Also, the exports of textile for Pakistan would be hurt since they are done to the EU directly.He said that TLP and the government were following the same objective that no one should insult the Prophet but their methods were different.Khan said that there were violent protests in Pakistan after Salman Rushdie’s book in 1990 but those protests failed to stop the repeated instances of blasphemy in the west in the subsequent years.“It means that protests are not a solution,” he said.The Prime Minister said that his strategy was to take leaders of all Muslims countries on board on this issue and educate the west about the gravity of the blasphemy and its impact on the sentiments of the Muslims.“We should tell the European nations how much we get hurt when someone insults our Prophet,” he said adding the Muslims should emulate the Jews who successfully established the sanctity of Holocaust.Khan promised that with the help of other Muslims countries, he will convince the Europeans that their blasphemous actions hurt the Muslims.Khan said the enemies of Pakistan were trying to paint the protest as civil war.He also asked the clerics to help the government to come out of the current unrest as the economy is going upward and it was not the time to hurt the country.Earlier, Khan addressing a gathering lamented that political and religious parties in Pakistan "misused" Islam to deal damage to the country, the Dawn newspaper reported."ln our country it is a great misfortune that many times our political parties and religious parties use Islam wrongly and use it such that they deal damage to their own country," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/expulsion-of-french-envoy-not-a-solution-to-blasphemy-in-the-west-imran-khan-on-radical-group-s-demand-101618845602112.html
19-04-2021||World||Britain adds India to travel 'red list' after Covid-19 surge||Britain on Monday imposed its strictest travel curbs on India after an explosion of coronavirus cases there, hours after Prime Minister Boris Johnson called off a trip to New Delhi.Health Secretary Matt Hancock said that effective from 0300 GMT on Friday, India was being added to Britain's "red list" of countries, banning all arrivals from India except for UK or Irish nationals.Those nationals, as well as foreigners resident in the UK, must pay hefty amounts to stay in a government-approved quarantine hotel for 10 days on their return from red list nations, which include Pakistan and Bangladesh."We've made the difficult but vital decision to add India to the red list," Hancock told parliament, after the government had faced days of criticism for holding off the decision, pending Johnson's trip.The decision was in light of surging case numbers and the emergence of a new Covid-19 variant in India, the health minister said, after the capital New Delhi entered a week-long lockdown.In the event, the UK and Indian governments earlier Monday called off Johnson's visit, which was set for next week after already being postponed in January.It would have been Johnson's first major foreign visit since he took power in 2019."In the light of the current coronavirus situation, Prime Minister Boris Johnson will not be able to travel to India next week," the two governments said in a joint statement.They said that Johnson and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi would instead speak later this month "to agree and launch their ambitious plans for the future partnership between the UK and India"."They will remain in regular contact beyond this, and look forward to meeting in person later this year."Johnson's office had last week announced the visit would be shortened. It was originally organised to span three days and set to begin on April 26.It had initially been heralded as an opportunity for Britain to refocus its international trade policy in the wake of Brexit as it pursues a so-called "global Britain" strategy.But spiking coronavirus cases, hospitalisations and deaths in Britain earlier this year led to its delay.Now, surging infections in India -- where officials have recorded five consecutive days of more than 200,000 cases -- have led to its entire cancellation.A total of 103 cases of the Indian variant have been identified in Britain, said Hancock.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/britain-adds-india-to-travel-red-list-after-covid-19-surge-101618844401711.html

It said Japanese Embassy officials have not been given access to him.Kyodo News agency reported that he was arrested on suspicion of spreading “fake” news.Kitazumi has posted reports and views about developments in Myanmar on Facebook. Hours before his arrest, he posted a video showing Myanmar citizens gathering at a Tokyo temple to pay tribute to people killed in the Myanmar military junta's crackdown on protests against its Feb. 1 seizure of power from an elected government.Kitazumi was detained briefly by police in late February while covering pro-democracy protests in Myanmar.Japan has stepped up its criticism of the military government's deadly crackdown on opposition but has taken a milder approach than the United States and some other countries that imposed sanctions against members of the junta.On Saturday, the junta released more than 23,000 prisoners to mark the traditional new year's holiday. At least three had been political prisoners, but it wasn't immediately clear if any activists detained during the post-coup crackdown were freed.According to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, which monitors casualties and arrests, government forces have killed at least 728 protesters and bystanders since the takeover. The group says 3,141 people, including ousted civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi, are in detention.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-asks-myanmar-junta-to-release-arrested-journalist-101618828543694.html
19-04-2021||World||'Britcoin' digital currency being considered by UK||Britain stepped up efforts on Monday to look at the case for a digital pound in response to the challenge posed by cryptocurencies such as bitcoin, and outlined plans to make its financial market more attractive after Brexit."We're launching a new taskforce between the Treasury and the Bank of England to coordinate exploratory work on a potential central bank digital currency (CBDC)," Britain's finance minister Rishi Sunak told a financial industry conference."Alongside this we will set up a new financial market infrastructure 'sandbox' for firms innovating with technologies like distributed ledger technologies," he added.The BoE said that it and the government had not yet made a decision on whether to introduce a CBDC in the UK, and that it would engage widely with stakeholders on the benefits, risks and practicalities of doing so.Any digital currency would be designed to exist alongside physical cash and existing bank deposits, rather than to replace them, the central bank said.The taskforce will monitor developments overseas to ensure the UK remains at the forefront of global innovation on digital currencies, it added.China is a front-runner to launch a CBDC, which could help authorities modernise financial systems, meet the threat from cryptocurrencies and speed up domestic and international payments.Last week, the European Central Bank said it was studying an electronic form of cash to complement banknotes and coins but any launch was still several years away.DARK TRADINGSince Britain's departure from the European Union's orbit on Dec. 31, the financial sector has faced restrictions on serving EU customers, and the British government is seeking to make London a more attractive global financial centre.The government will propose removing restrictions inherited from the EU, including on who can trade shares in London and the double volume cap.This would help Britain attract more "dark" or anonymous trading by big investors after Amsterdam toppled London as Europe's top share trading centre in January."The consultation process aims to deliver a rulebook that is fair, outcomes-based and supports competitiveness, whilst ensuring the UK maintains the highest regulatory standards," Sunak said.Britain will also propose changes to prospectuses, a document companies must publish when listing on an exchange or issuing new shares.The aim would be to ensure the rules are "not overly burdensome", Sunak said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/britcoin-digital-currency-being-considered-by-uk-101618825829232.html
19-04-2021||World||Approaching typhoon Surigae displaces 68,000 people in Philippines||An approaching typhoon has flooded villages in the eastern and central Philippines, where more than 68,000 people have been evacuated to safety as a precaution although the unusual summer storm may not blow inland, officials said Monday.Typhoon Surigae was about 235 kilometers (146 miles) east of eastern Catanduanes province on Monday afternoon with sustained winds of 195 kilometers (121 miles) per hour and gusts of up to 240 kph (149 mph). It is forecast to slowly move northwestward and then veer eastward away from the northern Philippines around Thursday.Vicente Malano, administrator of the government weather agency, said a high-pressure area extending from China to Japan was blocking the typhoon from blowing inland.The typhoon’s wide band of rainclouds and strong winds nevertheless flooded at least 22 villages and caused power outages in four provinces. More than 3,200 people and 43 ferries and cargo ships were stranded in seaports after the coast guard suspended sea travel as the typhoon blew nearer, the government disaster-response agency and the coast guard said.More than 18,000 families or 68,490 people were evacuated to emergency shelters as a precaution in nine provinces, the disaster agency said. Mayors said they have to open more evacuation centers to ensure social distancing during the pandemic.“It’s really tough, it’s toxic, but we have no choice,” Mayor Ann Gemma Ongjoco of Guinobatan town in Albay province said by telephone. She said even churches were used to shelter more than 6,100 villagers in her town, including many from communities threatened by mudflows from Mayon, one of the most active volcanoes in the archipelago.The Philippines is a coronavirus hotspot in Southeast Asia, with health officials reporting 945,745 infections and 16,048 deaths.About 20 typhoons and storms lash the Philippines each year. It also sits in the so-called Pacific “Ring of Fire,” a seismically sensitive region often hit by earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, making the impoverished nation one of the world’s most disaster-prone countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/approaching-typhoon-surigae-displaces-68-000-people-in-philippines-101618824884182.html

[L1N2MB022]The Financial Times first reported the meeting."We have seen media reports about talks between Iran and Saudi Arabia, although the reports sometimes had contradictory quotes," Foreign Ministry spokesman Saeed Khatibzadeh told a weekly news conference."What is important is that the Islamic Republic of Iran has always welcomed dialogue with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and considers it in the interest of the people of the two countries, as well as peace and stability in the region," he added.Saudi authorities have not responded to a Reuters request for comment on the talks.One of the sources said the meeting, arranged by Iraq's prime minister who visited Saudi Arabia earlier this month, had focused on Yemen, where a military coalition led by Riyadh has been battling the Iran-aligned Houthi movement.Sunni power Saudi Arabia had opposed the inernational nuclear accord with Shi'ite Iran for not tackling Tehran's missiles programme and regional behaviour.It has called for a stronger deal this time around at talks in Vienna aimed at bringing the United States and Iran back into compliance with the pact, which then U.S. President Donald Trump quit in 2018. Tehran breached several nuclear restrictions after Trump reimposed sanctions.President Joe Biden's administration is also pressing for a ceasefire in Yemen which is grappling with what the United Nations describes as the world's largest humanitarian crisis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-always-welcomes-dialogue-with-riyadh-foreign-ministry-says-101618821514137.html
19-04-2021||World||Russia hits back as US warns of response if opposition leader Alexey Navalny dies on hunger strike||Russia hit back defiantly after the US warned of “consequences” if jailed opposition leader Alexey Navalny dies on hunger strike, deepening the conflict over the dissident who’s already survived an alleged assassination attempt.“It’s obvious that Russia’s development as a strong, sovereign state is of no interest” to the West, Vyacheslav Volodin, speaker of the lower house of parliament and a close ally of President Vladimir Putin, said on Telegram Monday. Russia should brace for measures aimed at its vital energy sector and industry, he said.Amid fears of more potential sanctions, the ruble traded 0.5% weaker against the dollar as of 9:57 a.m. in Moscow, the worst performer in emerging markets after the Indian rupee.The US and Europe are pressing Putin to ensure proper medical care for Navalny, who began a hunger strike in prison March 31 to demand access to his personal doctors for acute back and leg pains. The opposition leader’s supporters on Sunday called for protests across Russia on April 21, the day Putin is due to give his annual state-of-the-nation address, after warning that the Kremlin’s most outspoken critic may be only days from death.“We have communicated to the Russian government...they will be held accountable by the international community,” US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said on CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sunday.“We are looking at a variety of different costs that we would impose, and I’m not going to telegraph that publicly at this point. But we have communicated that there will be consequences if Mr. Navalny dies,” Sullivan said.Navalny has been imprisoned since March 11 at the notorious IK-2 prison camp about 100 kilometers (60 miles) from Moscow for breaking parole rules while recuperating in Germany from a near-fatal poisoning in Siberia that he and Western governments blame on the Kremlin. Russian authorities deny any involvement.European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen called for the prisoner’s “immediate and unconditional release.” Navalny’s fate is in Putin’s hands, French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said on Sunday, while German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas told the daily Bild that Berlin “urgently” demands he receive adequate medical care.Anastasia Vasilieva, who heads the Alliance of Doctors union that is backed by Navalny, posted a copy of his blood-test results showing what she said were “critical” levels of potassium. “This signifies kidney failure, which can lead at any time to a severe disruption to his heartbeat” including the possibility of heart failure, she said on Twitter.In a post on his Instagram account Friday, Navalny’s allies reported that a prison official had warned him that a blood test indicated a “serious deterioration” in his health and that he would be force-fed if he didn’t end the protest.US SanctionsPresident Joe Biden on Thursday ordered a raft of new sanctions against Russia, including restrictions on buying new sovereign debt, in response to allegations that Moscow was behind a hack on SolarWinds Corp. and interfered with last year’s US election.Yet the moves were calibrated to punish the Kremlin for past behavior while keeping relations from deteriorating further, especially as tensions grow over a Russian military build-up near Ukraine. Biden has offered to meet Putin later this year, an invitation Russia said it responded to “positively.”Asked about Navalny’s condition on Saturday, Biden told reporters “It’s totally, totally unfair.”Russia’s Federal Penitentiary Service didn’t respond to requests for comment. Officials have said previously that Navalny has received all necessary medical attention.Biden pressed Putin in a phone call on Tuesday about the poisoning of the opposition leader, which US intelligence has publicly blamed on Russia’s Federal Security Service. German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron also quizzed Putin about Navalny in a March 30 phone call.Macron called for “clear red lines” in dealing with Russia in an interview with CBS’s Face the Nation broadcast on Sunday. “It’s a failure of our collective credibility vis-à-vis Russia,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-hits-back-as-us-warns-of-response-if-opposition-leader-alexey-navalny-dies-on-hunger-strike-101618824092225.html
19-04-2021||World||Attorneys at police officer Chauvin trial in Floyd death make final pitch||Attorneys in the trial of a former Minneapolis police officer charged with killing George Floyd are set to make their closing arguments Monday, each side seeking to distill three weeks of testimony to persuade jurors to deliver their view of the right verdict.For prosecutors, Derek Chauvin recklessly squeezed the life from Floyd as he and two other officers pinned him to the street for 9 minutes, 29 seconds outside a corner market, despite Floyd's repeated cries that he couldn't breathe — actions they say warrant conviction not just for manslaughter but also on two murder counts.For the defense, Floyd, who was Black, put himself at risk by swallowing fentanyl and methamphetamine, then resisted officers trying to arrest him — factors that compounded his vulnerability to a diseased heart and raise sufficient doubt that Chauvin, who is white, should be acquitted.Each side will pull key testimony to support their narrative for what killed Floyd in a case that roiled America 11 months ago and continues to resonate. The anonymous jury will later deliver verdicts in a courthouse surrounded by concrete barriers and razor wire, in an anxious city heavily fortified by National Guard members and just days after fresh outrage erupted over the police killing of a 20-year-old Black man in a nearby suburb.The attorneys aren't limited by time, though legal experts say overlong arguments risk losing jurors' attention and may be less effective. Prosecutors Steve Schleicher and Jerry Blackwell will share the closing, with Schleicher leading off and Blackwell coming on for the last-word rebuttal of defense attorney Eric Nelson's closing.Chauvin, 45, is charged with second-degree murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Experts expect Schleicher to walk jurors through the elements of the charges. All three require the jury to conclude that Chauvin's actions were a “substantial causal factor” in Floyd's death — and that his use of force was unreasonable.Schleicher can remind jurors of key testimony from a myriad prosecution medical experts who testified that Floyd died of asphyxiation caused by being pinned to the pavement. He and Blackwell can point to plentiful testimony from use-of-force experts who said Chauvin's actions were clearly improper, as well as Minneapolis Police Department officials saying they were outside his training.Video played a huge role at trial, both in buttressing the expert testimony and in driving home the emotional impact of Floyd's anguish and death. Prosecutors can re-play video during their closings, and experts say they expect it.Guilty verdicts must be unanimous, which means Nelson needs to raise doubt in the minds of just a single juror on the various counts. His closing is certain to return to the themes of his cross-examination of prosecution witnesses and the brief defense case he mounted.Nelson is sure to highlight how the county medical examiner, Dr. Andrew Baker, did not conclude that Floyd died of asphyxia — putting him at odds with the prosecution's medical experts, even though Baker did call Floyd's death a homicide and testify that he believes Floyd's heart gave out in part due to being pinned to the ground.Nelson is also certain to remind the jury of Floyd's drug use, perhaps with the same language he frequently used during the testimony phase — with questions that emphasized words such as “illicit." Despite the long duration of Floyd's restraint, he's likely to again portray Chauvin's use of force as dictated by “fluid” and “dynamic” factors that shouldn't be second-guessed, including the prospect that Chauvin was distracted by a threatening group of bystanders.Nelson is also likely to question perhaps the strongest single part of the state's case — the video of Floyd's arrest, including bystander Darnella Frazier's video that largely established public perceptions of events. Nelson argued that camera angles can be deceptive, and used other views to suggest to jurors that Chauvin's knee wasn't on Floyd's neck at all times.“If I was Nelson, I’d do a lot of things, because a lot of things need to be done,” Joe Friedberg, a local defense attorney not involved in the case, said. “He’s in desperate trouble here.”Fourteen jurors heard testimony, two of them alternates. If Judge Peter Cahill follows the usual practice of dismissing the last two chosen as alternates, the 12 who will deliberate will include six white and six Black or multiracial jurors.Second-degree murder requires prosecutors to prove Chauvin intended to harm Floyd. Third-degree murder requires proof that Chauvin's actions were “eminently dangerous” and done with indifference to loss of life. Second-degree manslaughter requires jurors to believe that he caused Floyd's death through negligence and consciously took the chance of causing severe injury or death.Each count carries a different maximum sentence: 40 years for second-degree unintentional murder, 25 years for third-degree murder, and 10 years for second-degree manslaughter. Sentencing guidelines call for far less time, including 12 1/2 years on either murder count.___Webber reported from Fenton, Mich.___Find AP’s full coverage of the death of George Floyd at: https://apnews.com/hub/death-of-george-floyd||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/attorneys-at-police-officer-chauvin-trial-in-floyd-death-make-final-pitch-101618824215074.html
19-04-2021||World||Radical Pakistan party releases 11 police hostages after anti-France protests||Eleven Pakistani police officers seized by supporters of a radical Islamist group as part of their campaign to get the French ambassador expelled have been released, officials said Monday.The officers were grabbed as hostages Sunday by supporters of the Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) during violent protests in Lahore.Video circulating on social media -- and confirmed unofficially by police as genuine -- showed some of them bloodied and bruised, with bandages around their heads.Interior Minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmed said the police had been released early Monday after "negotiations" with the TLP, which the government banned last week after effectively labelling it a terrorist organisation.The officers had been held at a TLP mosque stronghold in Lahore, which is now packed with supporters and surrounded by police."Negotiations have been started with TLP; the first round completed successfully," said Rashid in a video on Twitter."They have released 11 policemen who were made hostages."He said a second round of negotiations would take place later Monday, although it is not clear what they will discuss.Previously the TLP had set an April 20 deadline for the expulsion of the French ambassador.The group has been behind an anti-France campaign for months since President Emmanuel Macron defended the right of Charlie Hebdo magazine to republish cartoons depicting the Prophet Muhammad -- an act deemed blasphemous by many Muslims.Protests paralyse citiesLast week the embassy in Pakistan advised its nationals to leave the country -- a call that appears to have gone largely unheeded."The TLP people have gone inside the Mosque and the police have also stepped back," said Rashid."Hopefully, the rest of the issues will be settled in the second round."Rioting has rocked the country for the past week since the leader of the TLP was detained in Lahore after calling for a march on the capital.The protests have paralysed cities and led to the deaths of six policemen.TLP leaders say several of the party's supporters were killed in Sunday's clashes."We won't bury them until the French ambassador is kicked out," Allama Muhammad Shafiq Amini, a TLP leader in the city, said in a video statement.Prime Minister Imran Khan's government has struggled to bring TLP to heel over the years, but this week announced an outright ban against the group -- effectively labelling it a terrorist outfit.Still, on Saturday he suggested the party hadn't been banned for its ideology, but rather its methods."Let me make clear to people here & abroad: Our govt only took action against TLP under our anti-terrorist law when they challenged the writ of the state and used street violence & attacking the public & law enforcers," he tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/radical-pakistan-party-releases-11-police-hostages-after-anti-france-protests-101618824065001.html

"We responded this evening to a traffic congestion and during that congestion, numerous shots were fired," the spokesman said.One victim was shot in the head, while another suffered multiple gunshot wounds, according to local news outlet Love Shreveport-Bossier.Sunday's incidents came with the United States already on edge over a surge in shootings in recent weeks. A gunman killed eight workers and himself at an Indianapolis FedEx center on Thursday night, with at least seven deadly mass shootings reported in the United States over the past month.In Shreveport, located in northwest Louisiana, multiple police units were dispatched to the scene of the incident, which took place around 9 p.m. local time on Sunday on Hearne Avenue, according to the KSLA report. Victims were taken to Ochsners LSU Health and other local hospitals, the report added.Reuters was not immediately able to contact local police. The Shreveport mayor's office didn't immediately respond to Reuters' request for comment.Earlier on Sunday three people died at an apartment complex in Austin, Texas and authorities were hunting for a former deputy sheriff wanted in connection with the fatal shooting. Separately, three people were killed and two wounded in a shooting at a bar in Kenosha County, Wisconsin, in the early hours of Sunday.The spate of shootings has increased public pressure to tighten gun regulations. Most Americans support tougher gun laws, according to Reuters/Ipsos polling, but Washington has done little to address the problem in recent years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/five-people-shot-in-louisiana-incident-3rd-multiple-shooting-in-one-day-101618806891996.html
19-04-2021||World||UK PM Boris Johnson cancels India visit due to current Covid-19 situation||UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Monday called off a planned visit to India this week because of the Covid-19 situation, the second time this year he has deferred a trip to the country due to the pandemic.The UK government had decided last week to reduce the length of Johnson’s visit following discussions with the Indian side. The Indian mission in London had announced the visit was to begin on April 25.“In the light of the current Coronavirus situation, Prime Minister Boris Johnson will not be able to travel to India next week. Instead, Prime Ministers [Narendra] Modi and Johnson will speak later this month to agree and launch their ambitious plans for the future partnership between the UK and India,” said a spokesperson for the UK prime minister’s office.External affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi added the decision to call off the visit had been made by mutual agreement. “The two sides will be holding a virtual meeting in the coming days to launch plans for a transformed India-UK relationship,” he said.Hours after the announcement regarding the cancellation of the visit, UK secretary of state for health Matt Hancock told Parliament the government had included India in the “red list” of countries facing travel restrictions.Johnson told reporters in London that he and Modi had “basically come to the conclusion that, very sadly, I won’t be able to go ahead with the trip”. He added, “I do think it’s only sensible to postpone given what’s happening in India – the shape of the pandemic there.”He said the UK’s relationship with India is of “huge importance” and that he would hold a virtual meeting with Modi on April 26. “We’ll be trying to do as much as we can virtually. Of course, it will be frustrating but we’ll try and replicate as much as we can remotely and then look forward to doing it in person as and when circumstances allow and hopefully before the [COP26] Summit in November and hopefully we’ll get Narendra Modi over for the G7 in June,” he said.In January, Johnson cancelled a visit to India to be chief guest at the Republic Day celebrations in order to remain in Britain to focus on his government’s response to a new Coronavirus variant that was spreading rapidly at the time.While unveiling an integrated review of defence, development and foreign policy in March, the UK announced Johnson would travel to India at the end of April as part of Britain's tilt towards the Indo-Pacific. It had been expected that the bulk of Johnson’s engagements would have been in New Delhi on April 26, and that the two sides would make some key announcements and sign some agreements.Monday’s development came against the backdrop of mounting criticism in Britain for Johnson’s plans to go ahead with the trip to New Delhi at a time when India is witnessing a massive surge in Covid-19 infections. The country recorded more than 270,000 cases and more than 1,600 deaths on Sunday.Making a statement on the Covid-19 situation in the UK Parliament, Hancock said 103 cases of the Indian “double mutant” Covid-19 variant had been detected so far.“After studying the data and on a precautionary basis, we’ve made the difficult but vital decision to add India to the red list. This means anyone who is not a UK or Irish resident or a British citizen, cannot enter the UK if they’ve been in India in the previous 10 days,” Hancock said.British citizens who have been in India before their arrival will need to complete hotel quarantine of 10 days, and the rules will come into force from Friday.On Sunday, the main opposition Labour Party joined calls for Johnson to cancel his visit. “I can’t see why the prime minister can’t conduct his business with the Indian government via Zoom,” said Labour’s shadow communities secretary Steve Reed.“The prime minister, like all of us in public life, needs to try and set an example. I’d much rather the prime minister did it by Zoom rather than travelling to India,” Reed told Sky News.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-pm-boris-johnson-cancels-india-visit-due-to-current-covid-19-situation-101618822121309.html

Only a small percentage of the population had these adverse effects for AstraZeneca," Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire told a regular news conference, referring to countries where blood clots were reported.Health authorities will release guidelines to include different precautions on the use of the AstraZeneca shots, Vergeire added.The European Medicines Agency had earlier recommended to include blood clots as a rare side effect of the AstraZeneca vaccine.The Southeast Asian nation has yet to record blood clots as side effect. It suspended the use of AstraZeneca's vaccine for under 60s on April 8.The Philippines, a country of 108 million people, is battling one of the worst outbreaks in Asia but has administered less than 1.5 million shots of Covid-19 vaccines, 86% of which were first doses.It has recorded 936,133 Covid-19 cases and 15,960 deaths due to the virus.The Philippines has received 525,600 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine through the COVAX international vaccine-share facility. More than 900,000 more were to be shipped in May or June, according to health ministry data.Vaccines from China's Sinovac Biotech accounts for 83% of doses so far delivered to the Philippines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/philippines-lifts-suspension-on-astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine-for-under-60s-101618818039200.html
19-04-2021||World||Joe Biden pressed on emissions goal as climate summit nears||When President Joe Biden convenes a virtual climate summit on Thursday, he faces a vexing task: how to put forward a nonbinding but symbolic goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that will have a tangible impact not only on climate change efforts in the US but throughout the world.The emissions target, eagerly awaited by all sides of the climate debate, will signal how aggressively Biden wants to move on climate change, a divisive and expensive issue that has riled Republicans to complain about job-killing government overreach even as some on the left worry Biden has not gone far enough to address a profound threat to the planet.The climate crisis poses a complex political challenge for Biden, since the problem is harder to see and far more difficult to produce measurable results on than either the pandemic relief package or the infrastructure bill.The target Biden chooses “is setting the tone for the level of ambition and the pace of emission reductions over the next decade,″ said Kate Larsen, a former White House adviser who helped develop President Barack Obama’s climate action plan.The number has to be achievable by 2030 but aggressive enough to satisfy scientists and advocates who call the coming decade a crucial, make-or-break moment for slowing climate change, Larsen and other experts said.Scientists, environmental groups and even business leaders are calling on Biden to set a target that would cut US greenhouse gas emissions by at least 50% below 2005 levels by 2030.The 50% target, which most experts consider a likely outcome of intense deliberations underway at the White House, would nearly double the nation’s previous commitment and require dramatic changes in the power and transportation sectors, including significant increases in renewable energy such as wind and solar power and steep cuts in emissions from fossil fuels such as coal and oil.Anything short of that goal could undermine Biden’s promise to prevent temperatures from rising more than 1.5 degrees Celsius, experts say, while likely stirring up sharp criticism from international allies and Biden’s own supportersThe target is significant, not just as a visible goal for the US to achieve after four years of climate inaction under President Donald Trump, but also for “leveraging other countries,'' Larsen said. “That helps domestically in the battle that comes after, which is implementing policies to achieve that target. We can make a better case politically at home if other countries are acting at the same level of ambition as the US″The 2030 goal, known as a Nationally Determined Contribution, or NDC, is a key part of the Paris climate agreement, which Biden rejoined on his first day in office. It’s also an important marker as Biden moves toward his ultimate goal of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.“Clearly the science demands at least 50%” in reduced greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, said Jake Schmidt, a climate expert at the Natural Resources Defense Council, a leading environmental group.The 50% target “is ambitious, but it is achievable,'' he said in an interview. It's also a good climate message, he said: “People know what 50% means — it's half.''Whatever target Biden picks, the climate summit itself “proves the US is back in rejoining the international effort″ to address climate change, said Larsen, now a director at the Rhodium Group, an independent research firm.The summit is “the starting gun for climate diplomacy” after a four-year “hiatus” under Trump, she said. John Kerry, Biden's climate envoy, has been pressing global leaders in person and online ahead of the summit for commitments and alliances on climate efforts.Nathaniel Keohane, another former Obama White House adviser and now a vice president at the Environmental Defense Fund, said experts have coalesced around the need to reduce emissions by at least 50% by 2030.“The number has to start with 5,” he said, adding, “We've done the math. We need at least 50%.''The 2030 target is just one in a sometimes overlapping set of goals that Biden has outlined on climate. He also has said he expects to adopt a clean energy standard that would make electricity carbon-free by 2035, along with the wider goal of net-zero carbon emissions economy-wide by 2050.Biden's climate adviser, Gina McCarthy, acknowledged that the sheer volume of numbers can be confusing. At a forum last week, she and former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg said climate activists should focus on actions in the next decade.“Let’s stop talking about 2050,'' said McCarthy, who is leading White House efforts to develop US climate commitments for 2030.Bloomberg, 79, was even more blunt: 2050 “is a good number for people who give speeches, but I don’t know anyone giving those speeches who’s going to be alive in 2050.''Some Republican lawmakers call the focus on reducing US emissions counter-productive, saying Biden's plan would raise energy costs and kill American jobs while allowing Russia, China and other countries to increase greenhouse gas emissions.“The Biden administration will set punishing targets for the United States, while our adversaries keep the status quo. That won’t solve climate change,'' said Sen. Wyoming Sen. John Barrasso, the top Republican on the Senate Energy Committee. The United States already leads the world in reducing carbon emissions, Barrasso said, adding that Biden should try to “make American energy as clean as we can, as fast as we can, without raising costs for consumers.”Some on the left think Biden is not going far enough.Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a New York Democrat who has called for a massive Green New Deal, said Biden deserves “a lot of credit” for his infrastructure plan's vision and scope, but said it falls far short of what is needed to meaningfully combat the climate crisis. She and her supporters are calling for at least $10 trillion in federal spending over the next decade to address climate change and other problems.McCarthy disputed the notion that Biden has backtracked from campaign promises to lead on climate.“We’re always either doing too little or too much,'' she told reporters earlier this month. “But rest assured that the president put a (spending) number out here that he felt was not just defensible but required to meet this moment in time.''Much of the proposed spending to address climate change is included in Biden’s $2.3 trillion infrastructure bill.If Republicans think less money should be spent on clean energy and infrastructure, McCarthy added, “then we’ll have those conversations.”Marcella Burke, a former Trump administration official who now is an energy lawyer in Houston, gives Biden an “A-Plus for enthusiasm” on climate, but an incomplete on details. “We've had a lot of goals, but not a lot of strategy announced to get there,'' she said. "So the jury is still out.''||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-pressed-on-emissions-goal-as-climate-summit-nears-101618810096964.html

19-04-2021||World||Emotions run high as Australia-New Zealand travel bubble opens||Emotions ran high Monday as excited passengers set off on the first flights to take advantage of a quarantine-free travel bubble between Australia and New Zealand, allowing families split when borders closed almost 400 days ago to finally reunite."(I'll) yell, scream, cry, hug, kiss, (feel) happy -- all of these emotions at once," Denise O'Donoghue, 63, told AFP at Sydney airport as she prepared to board her flight.The arrangement means that for the first time since the pandemic closed borders worldwide, passengers can fly in either direction across the Tasman Sea without undergoing mandatory Covid-19 quarantine when they arrive."It's a very big day and exciting for families and friends," said New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, who hailed the success of both countries in containing the virus as a key factor in allowing the travel corridor.Australia was New Zealand's largest source of international tourists before the pandemic, accounting for about 1.5 million arrivals or 40 percent of total visitors in 2019.But on the first day of the bubble, most of the travelers were returning New Zealanders, with tourists expected to start arriving in large numbers during the upcoming Australian school holidays.The bubble's opening received saturation coverage from media in both countries, with live television reporting from airports providing regular updates on the progress of flights.On a grass embankment at the foot of Wellington Airport's runway, the words 'WELCOME WHANAU' (family) were spelled out in giant letters.In the airport terminal, Maori dancers performed a traditional powhiri welcoming ceremony for the arrivals.Lorraine Wratt, a New Zealander stranded by the pandemic while visiting family in Australia, told AFP it was "wonderful" to be able to travel again."We're very excited to be heading back home but we're gonna miss our family (in Australia) big time," she said."We came to Australia on December 11 to spend Christmas with our children... planning to go back in February, it's been a bit of a nightmare."'Back to normal'Australia is home to hundreds of thousands of expatriate New Zealanders and before coronavirus many regularly shuttled back and forth across the Tasman on three-hour flights."It's like it's one big country, so it's very good to open the borders, it will help all the families," Mehat El Masri told AFP as he waited to see his Sydney-based son Shady for the first time in 16 months."We appreciate it. We're doing very well in New Zealand and Australia with precautions and keeping things under control... we're fortunate compared to the rest of the world."O'Donoghue said the travel bubble's opening made her feel the world was returning to some sort of normality."I'll be going back, they'll be coming over, we'll just be back to normal," she said."What normal's going to be from now on I don't know, but I'm just really, really excited today."Air New Zealand executive Craig Suckling said the atmosphere at Sydney airport before departure was electric."It was quite the emotional rollercoaster here in Sydney," he said."The check-in area was a hive of activity and at the boarding gate, customers were eager to get on."The airline's chief executive Greg Foran said it was also a "monumental" day for those involved in the hard-hit tourism industry."(It's) a real turning point for the airline. It's day one of our revival," he said.Australia has previously flagged the possibility of travel bubbles with Singapore, South Korea, Japan and Taiwan, while New Zealand is working to allow unrestricted access to small Pacific states such as the Cook Islands and Tuvalu.Morrison has also raised the prospect that by year's end, Australians who have received a Covid-19 vaccination may be able to travel internationally then self isolate at home upon return, rather than facing two weeks quarantine in a hotel.But the leaders of both countries warned further border changes in the wake of the trans-Tasman bubble would be a slow, carefully planned process."The idea that on one day everything just opens, that's not how this is going to happen," Morrison said."It will happen cautiously and carefully, working very hard on the medical and health protections."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/emotions-run-high-as-australia-new-zealand-travel-bubble-opens-101618806598855.html
19-04-2021||World||Queen Elizabeth's handwritten note on Prince Philip's coffin harks back to her childhood: Report||Britain's Queen Elizabeth II left a handwritten note on her late husband Prince Philip's coffin as the royal family gathered on Saturday at St George's Chapel in Windsor Castle for the Duke of Edinburgh's funeral, the People Magazine reported. The note was signed with the Queen's childhood nickname "Lilibet" and the report said Prince Philip is thought to be the last person to have referred to the monarch by that name. The palace refused to elaborate further on the "private detail", the magazine added.Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh, died on April 9 at the age of 99. At the time of his death, the Queen and he had been married for over 73 years in a lifetime of service to the crown.Sitting by herself apart from family members at her husband's funeral on Saturday, the Queen cut a regal but solitary figure, wearing a face mask and dressed all in black, except for the diamond brooch that flashed on her left shoulder—a piece she had often worn on engagements with her husband. The entire royal procession and funeral took place out of public view within the grounds of the castle, a 950-year-old royal residence 20 miles (30 kilometres) west of London, but was shown live on television. Just 30 mourners were allowed to attend the funeral service.The United Kingdom observed a minute's silence at 3pm (local time) nationwide, honouring the late duke. Gunfire signalled the start of the funeral service, steeped in military and royal tradition, but, reflecting Philip’s military ties, both as the ceremonial commander of many units and as a veteran of the Royal Navy who served with distinction during World War II.The monarch's four children—Prince Charles, Princess Anne, Prince Andrew and Prince Edward were present, as were the Queen and Philip’s eight grandchildren. William and Harry were part of the nine-member royal contingent, although their cousin, Peter Phillips, walked between them. After the service, they walked back to the castle together, seeming to chat amiably. Their appearance at the service stirred memories of the 1997 funeral of Princess Diana, when William and Harry, then 15 and 12, walked behind their mother’s coffin accompanied by Philip.The Duchess of Sussex, Meghan Markle, who could not attend Prince Philip's funeral service held at St. George's Chapel in Windsor Castle on Saturday due to medical reasons, also sent a handwritten note and a personalised wreath of flowers to be laid at his services. The wreath was a special tribute from Meghan as the flowers were picked from Crossley's personal garden, made up of Eryngium to represent the Royal Marines and Acanthus mollis, the national flower of Greece, the country in which the Duke of Edinburgh was born.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/the-queen-left-a-wistful-handwritten-note-on-late-husband-s-coffin-report-101618802773468.html
19-04-2021||World||Germany mourns 80k Covid-19 deaths||Germany paid tribute on Sunday to the nearly 80,000 people it has lost to the coronavirus pandemic, even as the country struggles to get a grip on another rise in infections.President Frank-Walter Steinmeier led a memorial event with other top officials at Berlin’s Konzerthaus concert hall. It was dedicated to the bereaved “who could not accompany their relatives when they died and for whom important and comforting rituals of mourning were not possible”.Germany’s confirmed death toll from Covid-19 stood at 79,914 on Sunday, an increase of 67 over the previous day. It is the fifth highest total in Europe, after the UK, Italy, Russia and France.Germany had a comparatively small number of deaths in the pandemic’s first phase, but saw much higher infection levels in the fall and winter. In January, more than 1,000 deaths per day were reported at times in the country of 83 million people.Fauci expects US decision on J&J vaccine by FridayA decision on whether to end a US pause in vaccinations with the Johnson & Johnson Covid-19 shot is likely by Friday, top US pandemic adviser Anthony Fauci has said. A government-convened expert panel has been assessing the vaccine’s possible links to a clotting disorder seen in a half-dozen relatively young women.Fauci told ABC that by Friday “we should have an answer as to where we’re going with it. I would think that we’re not going to go beyond Friday in the extension of this pause”.The Gaza Strip recorded its highest-ever daily toll from Covid-19, authorities said on Sunday, as the Israeli-blockaded territory struggles with a dearth of vaccines. On Sunday, the Gaza Strip’s health ministry announced “23 deaths in the past 24 hours”, taking its toll to 761 deaths.Israel, meanwhile, has lifted a mask mandate and reopened its education system in the latest easing of restrictions following its mass vaccination drive.Canada reports 2nd case of blood clot from AZ jabA second case has emerged of a person in Canada suffering from blood clots after taking AstraZeneca’ Covid-19 vaccine.The case was reported on Saturday in the province of Alberta in an unidentified man in his 60s. He had recently received a dose of the AZ vaccine manufactured by the Pune-based Serum Institute of India (SII) under the brand Covishield.The man was “diagnosed, treated promptly and is now recovering”, Deena Hinshaw, Alberta’s chief medical officer of health, tweeted. Canadian health authorities continue to urge people to get vaccinated.During the course of a media interaction following the announcement of the case, Hinshaw said, “I continue to recommend AstraZeneca for anyone who is 55 and older.” She pointed out that it was only the second case in the country after more than 700,000 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine had been administered.With inputs from Anirudh Bhattacharyya||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-mourns-80k-covid-19-deaths-101618802477273.html

Austin police said its officers were “on scene of an active shooting incident” in the northwest part of the city.Austin-Travis county emergency medical services department said three “adult patients” were dead at the scene of the shooting, which was reported shortly before noon, local time.“No additional patients have been reported or located at this time,” the department said on Twitter about an hour after the incident was first reported. Police urged residents to avoid the area.In a separate incident, three people were killed and two were seriously wounded in a shooting at a busy tavern in southeastern Wisconsin early on Sunday, officials said. Kenosha County sheriff David Beth said the suspect in the shooting at Somers House Tavern is still at large, but that he believes the public is not in danger.“We believe our suspect knew who he was targeting,” Beth said during a Sunday morning news conference. He asked that anyone with information about the shooting contact the Kenosha sheriff’s department. Kenosha is about 50km south of Milwaukee, not far from the Wisconsin-Illinois border.The suspect had been asked to leave the bar, but returned and opened fire. Beth said shots were fired inside and outside the bar, which he described as “very busy” at the time. He left open the possibility that there was more than one suspect. He said he believed at least one handgun was used.Officials were still working to determine the identities of the people who died. Beth said two people died at the scene. The third person hopped in a car with two other people, who moments later flagged down a police vehicle. The officer drove the victim to a hospital where that person was pronounced dead, Beth said.The two people who were shot and wounded were taken to area hospitals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/gun-violence-us-rocked-by-two-separate-shooting-incidents-101618800833136.html

The TLP has been behind an anti-France campaign for months since President Emmanuel Macron defended the right of Charlie Hebdo magazine to republish cartoons depicting Prophet Mohammed -- an act deemed blasphemous in Pakistan.The protests have paralysed cities and led to the deaths of six policemen.“The TLP members are holding five police officers and two rangers hostage,” said Rana Arif, a police spokesman in Lahore. Firdous Ashiq Awan, a spokeswoman for the Punjab provincial government, said 12 policemen had been abducted and taken to a TLP mosque in Lahore.“Violent groups armed with petrol bombs and acid bottles stormed the Nawankot police station this morning,” she tweeted. TLP leaders say several of the party’s supporters were killed in Sunday’s clashes.An oil truck was seized and petrol bombs thrown at officers, both Arif and Awan said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/rangers-cops-held-hostage-by-anti-france-protesters-in-pakistan-101618800328849.html

Attendees have criticised the Chicago Police Department for a long history of misconduct, particularly in Black and Latino neighbourhoods, and called for justice for Adam, who was Latino. Stillman is white.The events also have called attention to other recent killings by police, including the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis -- Derek Chauvin is on trial for Floyd's death -- and the recent fatal shooting of another Black man, Daunte Wright, in a Minneapolis suburb.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/vigil-peace-walk-in-chicago-after-police-shooting-of-13-year-old-boy-101618793518464.html

19-04-2021||World||Former sheriff's deputy on the run for fatal shooting of 3 in Texas||A manhunt was underway Sunday for a former sheriff's deputy wanted in the fatal shooting of three people in Austin, Texas, as an official said it wasn't known if the suspect was still in the city.Interim Austin Police Chief Joseph Chacon said those who live near where the shooting happened late Sunday morning no longer had to shelter in place, but he said they should “remain vigilant.” He said officials were transitioning the search for Stephen Broderick, 41, from that area to a “fugitive search.”“The victims were all known to this suspect.,” Chacon said. "At this point, we do not think this individual is out there targeting random people to shoot. That does not mean he is not dangerous.“Earlier in the day, nearby residents had been asked to shelter in place and to call their neighbors to check on them. Chacon had said earlier that officials were concerned that Broderick "might possibly take a hostage and be himself sheltered somewhere waiting for us to leave.”Chacon said Broderick is 5 feet, 7 inches (1.7 meters) tall and Black. He was wearing a gray hoodie, sunglasses and a baseball cap. Chacon said police do not know if he's in a vehicle or on foot.He said that Broderick was a former deputy with the Travis County sheriff's office, which is based in Austin.Travis County District Attorney Jose Garza said in a statement that Broderick had been arrested for sexual assault of a child last June and was released on $50,000 bond. He said that the district attorney's office on Sunday filed a motion to revoke that bond and is actively supporting law enforcement as they pursue Broderick.Sheriff's spokeswoman Kristen Dark tells the Austin American-Statesman that Broderick, a property crimes detective, resigned after the arrest.The newspaper also reports that Broderick's wife filed for a protective order and divorce shortly after his arrest.Chacon said Broderick is suspected in the killing of two Hispanic women and one Black man. He said Broderick knew the victims but didn't elaborate on how or provide a motive for the shootings. Chacon also said a child was involved but that the child has been located and is safe.Brenda Torres said she was driving by when she saw a little boy flag down a car and a Black man lying facedown on the ground.“I saw the little boy point down the street," Torres said. "There was someone lying on the ground. I thought someone had just fallen down or something. As my light turns green and I’m driving, I see cop car after cop car after cop car rushing toward where I just was.”Chacon said the three were not shot in a building but did not give any further details.Following the shooting, there was a large presence of emergency responders at the scene, including dozens of police cars, several ambulances, two SWAT trucks and two police helicopters. Later Sunday, law enforcement began leaving the area.The area includes a strip mall containing several retail stores and large apartment complexes situated near wooded rolling hills.Josh Katzowitz, who had been shopping at the nearby Trader Joe’s, said police and ambulances came “pouring in” to the area as he was leaving. He didn’t hear any shooting.“The cops had their guns out,” he said. “Some had pistols, some had rifles and they were strapping on bulletproof vests. There were all of a sudden ambulances, sirens and police cars. There were cops coming from everywhere.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/former-sheriff-s-deputy-on-the-run-for-fatal-shooting-of-3-in-texas-101618791514743.html

Cinthya Umanzor of the Harris County Constable Precinct 4 said.The 2019 Tesla Model S was traveling at a high rate of speed, when it failed to negotiate a curve and went off the roadway, crashing to a tree and bursting into flames, local television station KHOU-TV said.After the fire was extinguished, authorities located 2 occupants in the vehicle, with one in the front passenger seat while the other was in the back seat of the Tesla, the report said, citing Harris County Precinct 4 Constable Mark Herman.Tesla and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The accident comes amid growing scrutiny over Tesla's semi-automated driving system following recent accidents and as it is preparing to launch its updated "full self-driving" software to more customers.The US auto safety agency said in March it has opened 27 investigations into crashes of Tesla vehicles; at least three of the crashes occurred recently.Tesla CEO Elon Musk said in January that he expects huge profits from its full self-driving software, saying he is "highly confident the car will be able to drive itself with reliability in excess of human this year."The self-driving technology must overcome safety and regulatory hurdles to achieve commercial success.Umanzor said the two crash victims were born in 1962 and 1951.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/2-dead-in-tesla-crash-in-texas-that-was-believed-to-be-driverless-101618791578094.html
19-04-2021||World||Oxford starts first study to reinfect recovered Covid-19 patients||People who have fought off the Covid-19 virus will be deliberately reinfected in a first-of-its-kind trial at the University of Oxford that may shed light on how to develop more effective vaccines against the pathogen.Researchers are looking for 64 healthy, previously Covid-infected volunteers from 18 to 30 years old to be studied under controlled, quarantined conditions for at least 17 days, the U.K. university said Monday. Participants will be infected with the original strain from Wuhan, China and followed for a year.Initial data from the Oxford study should be available within several months, helping vaccine developers look at levels and types of immunity needed to prevent reinfection, and how long protection persists. Challenge trials, involving deliberate, supervised infections, are seen as particularly helpful for answering questions like these, because they allow scientists to scrutinize the details of how the body confronts the virus and vice versa.While vaccines and previous infections provide some immune protection against the coronavirus, concerns and doubts remain about how long it lasts. A recent study indicated that as much as 10% of previously infected young adults were reinfected, underscoring the need for effective vaccines to prevent spread, and Pfizer Inc.’s chief executive officer has said that booster shots may be needed to maintain the immunity provided by the initial two doses of the company’s shot.The Oxford study “has the potential to transform our understanding by providing high-quality data on how our immune system responds to a second infection,” said Shobana Balasingam, a research adviser at the Wellcome Trust, which is providing funds. The findings could “inform not just vaccine development but also research into the range of effective treatments that are also urgently needed.”One of the goals of the study is to determine how much virus, on average, it takes to infect someone who’s had the virus earlier. In a second phase of the study, a different group of patients will be given that dose and studied for their immune responses, Oxford said.The earliest volunteers in the world’s first human challenge trial involving the coronavirus, conducted by Imperial College in London, left quarantine in late March. That trial, which intentionally infected people who hadn’t previously had the virus, was backed by 33.6 million pounds ($46.3 million) of U.K. government funding.Critics of challenge trials have pointed out the ethical dangers of infecting people without being sure of its long-term consequences. The Oxford researchers said that all those enrolled will be completely fit, well and recovered from their first Covid infection.Participants who develop Covid symptoms will be treated with an antibody drug from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. that’s been authorized by U.S. regulators, Oxford said. Subjects will only be discharged from the quarantine unit when they are no longer infected and not at risk of infecting others, according to the statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/oxford-starts-first-study-to-reinfect-recovered-covid-19-patients-101618788650163.html

19-04-2021||World||US, China agree to cooperate on climate crisis||China and the United States, the world’s two biggest carbon polluters, agreed to cooperate to curb climate change with “seriousness and urgency” and enhance collaboration in multilateral processes, including the Paris Agreement, days before President Joe Biden hosts a virtual summit of world leaders to discuss the issue.The joint statement was issued on Sunday after a meeting between Chinese climate envoy Xie Zhenhua and his US counterpart, John Kerry, in Shanghai on Thursday and Friday, China’s ecology and environment ministry said on Sunday.“China and the US, together with other countries, are committed to cooperating with each other on tackling the climate crisis, to be addressed with the seriousness and urgency that it demands,” the statement said.This includes, it added, strengthening their “respective actions and cooperating in multilateral fronts such as the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Paris Agreement”.The two countries will continue to discuss “concrete actions in the 2020s to reduce emissions aimed at keeping the Paris Agreement-aligned temperature limit within reach”.Kerry’s Shanghai stop, carried out under strict anti-Covid-19 protocols, was the first high-level visit of an official from US President Joe Biden’s administration to China.The China-US joint statement on fighting climate crisis together comes amid strained bilateral ties on a range of issues, including Taiwan, South China Sea, Xinjiang, and Hong Kong.The dialogue marked a resumption of exchange on climate between China and the US, the two biggest greenhouse gas emitters, halted during former US President Donald Trump’s tenure.Biden brought the US back into the Paris climate accord; Washington had withdrawn from it under Trump.“Moving forward, China and the US are firmly committed to working together and with other parties to strengthen implementation of the Paris Agreement,” the joint statement said.Climate cooperation between the two countries will include renewable energy, green and climate-resilient agriculture, low-carbon transportation, and emissions of methane and other non-CO2 greenhouse gases.Meeting with reporters in Seoul on Sunday, Kerry said the language in the statement is “strong” and that the two countries agreed on “critical elements on where we have to go.” But the former secretary of state said, “I learned in diplomacy that you don’t put your back on the words, you put on actions. We all need to see what happens.”Chinese vice foreign minister Le Yucheng, in an interview to Associated Press, welcomed the US’ return on international climate affairs under the Biden administration but urged it “to redouble its efforts to make up for the time lost during its absence”, referring to the time when Trump withdrew from the Paris accord.Le reiterated China’s goals to peak its carbon dioxide emission by 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2060.China said in the joint statement that it is looking forward to the Biden-led virtual climate summit to be held this week. Biden has invited 40 world leaders, including Chinese President Xi Jinping, to the April 22-23 summit.It is not yet known if Chinese President Xi Jinping will join the summit.The US and other countries are expected to announce more ambitious national targets for cutting carbon emissions ahead of or at the meeting, along with pledging financial help for climate efforts by less wealthy nations.During a video meeting with German and French leaders Friday, Xi said that climate change “should not become a geopolitical chip, a target for attacking other countries or an excuse for trade barriers”, the official Xinhua News Agency reported.On whether Xi would join the summit, Le said “the Chinese side is actively studying the matter.”(With inputs from Associated Press)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/differences-aside-china-and-us-agree-to-fight-climate-crisis-together-101618747526900.html
19-04-2021||India||Need to resolve legacy issues through dialogue, not unilateral actions: Naravane||In an apparent reference to China amid border standoff in eastern Ladakh, Chief of Army Staff General MM Naravane on Monday said that "legacy issues and differences need to be resolved through mutual consent and dialogue and not by unilateral actions."Speaking on 'Geopolitics of Indo-Pacific Region' during the 'Chief of Army Symposium 2021' organised by the Australian Army, Gen Naravane also said there have been "positive developments" along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) with China.He also referred to agreement in February with Pakistan on maintainance of ceasefire and said "India's relations with all its neighbours are on an upward trend".Gen Naravane, who spoke through video-confernencing, said the changing character of war is throwing up new challenges for the armed forces the world over. "Our own region is witness that wars are no longer confined to the customary hard core kinetics but being increasingly contested in the ambiguous grey zone," he said.The Army Chief said India has more than 15,000 kilometers of land borders alone. "We have strong relations with our neighbours based on shared culture, history and people to people linkages. We however have active and unsettled borders to our west with Pakistan and to the north and east with China, and of course, there are associated challenges," he said.He said the country, over time, has developed various mechanisms to address these challenges and move forward."As you would appreciate progress and development of any nation and the well-being of its citizenry are, to a large extent, contingent on peace and tranquillity on the borders. On our western borders, we have recently entered into a ceasefire understanding with Pakistan Army in February this year, and since then there has been no exchange of fire on an otherwise active Line of Control. This bodes well for the future," he said."With China too, there have been positive developments along the Line of Actual Control, an area where both countries have differing perceptions on the alignment of the land borders. This has led to disengagement of troops in Eastern Ladakh," he added.The Army chief said the two countries have recently concluded the 11th round of Corps Commander level talks and "we hope to settle our other border through further negotiations"."The recent comments of Ambassador Sun Weidong, the Chinese Ambassador to New Delhi to avoid relapse and jointly safeguard peace and tranquillity in border areas augers well for the future of India-China relations," General Naravane added.He also talked about 'strong historical and cultural linkages' with Nepal and Bhutan, and said, "the large community of retired soldiers from Indian Army's Gurkha Battalions of Nepal Origin, form a strong connect with the people of Nepal. Similarly, with Bhutan, the Indian Army shares strong institutional linkages, which has stood the test of time."He said India looks to maintain peace and harmony with all its neighbours and in the region.Maintenance of peace and tranquility requires joint efforts. All nations need to come together to uphold Rules Based Order, respect International Laws & norms and develop mutual respect for each other. Legacy issues and differences need to be resolved through mutual consent and dialogue and not by unilateral actions," he said.The Chiefs of Japan Ground Self Defence Forces, Australian Army, Indonesian Army and Singapore Army also took part in the symposium.General Naravane said geo-strategic spaces are being constricted and geostrategic realities are being altered without physical battles."Conflicts are also steadily moving to the new domains of space, cyber and informatics," he said.The Army chief said that the stretching of domains has made the physical boundaries meaningless and leveraging technology has become a key determinant in future wars."Capability development is an ongoing process and the Indian Army is also on the path of modernization towards a 'Technology Oriented Army'. We are conscious that niche technologies including AI, autonomous and unmanned systems, long-range precision technology, Internet of Things, 5G and Quantum Computing, to name a few, need to be acquired to remain and capable to face future threats," he said."However, even as we move to a Technology Empowered Army, the peculiar unsettled nature of our borders means that the requirement of 'Boots on Ground' cannot be simply wished away," he added.Speaking about India's Atmanirbhar Bharat' initiative, the Army Chief said for a country like India, self-reliance has become a strategic imperative."We have launched the 'Atmanirbhar Bharat' initiative to achieve self-reliance through Indigenization. But Indigenous production or Make in India does not mean that we close ourselves to others and produce everything. In today's world integrated by technology, this is simply not possible. In our quest for self-sufficiency, we look towards others for support and cooperation," he said.General Naravane said that the nascent but rapidly growing defence sector in India offers new prospects and opportunities to its friends and partners to be part of its growth story."With a strong IT sector and a booming start-up culture, we look at joint ventures and technology cooperation with others. A large number of foreign companies are already moving base to India and setting up new plants. For the Indian Armed Forces, this means better options and customized solutions," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/need-to-resolve-legacy-issues-through-dialogue-not-unilateral-actions-naravane-101618854929347.html
19-04-2021||India||Uttar Pradesh: Simplify hospital admission process of Covid patients, Priyanka tells Adityanath||Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Monday slammed “red-tapism” in Uttar Pradesh, alleging that lives were lost because Covid patients needed permission from the district chief medical officers to get admission in hospitals.In a letter to Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, the Congress general secretary urged the creation of a database of available hospitals and beds to that people can seek admission directly.She claimed there are reports from many places in the state that Covid-19 patients require the CMO’s permission for hospital admission.Patients are waiting for hospitalisation for a long time and their families are running around from one place to another, she said citing “information” received by the party.“Many people have lost their lives due to this system," the letter in Hindi alleged.Priyanka Gandhi said she has been told that people who try to get oxygen cylinders face a similar situation as they need permission from the district magistrate.“An unfortunate incident took place outside the oxygen factory in Lucknow's Talkatora Industrial area, when people standing in a line attacked government officials,” she said.Police, however, said nobody was attacked.Priyanka Gandhi asked what should those in home quarantine do if their condition worsens and they need oxygen.The Congress leaders said there is already a terrible crisis of oxygen beds in hospitals and in such a situation, "this step of your administration is fatal for those who are treating Covid-19 at home".She said at a time when families of patients are suffering, such red-tapism is increasing their misery."Please simplify the process of admission of Covid-19 patients in hospitals by considering every life essential,” she said.“Also, release a centralised database of hospitals and available beds, so that people can directly enroll Covid-19 patients in hospitals.""This is the time to help people in distress. In this difficult time, we all need to work above politics. The Congress party is united with the people of the state and is ready to help the government in every way," she said.She wished a speedy recovery to Adityanath who recently tested positive for Covid-19.Earlier on Twitter, she levelled the same charge about the hospital admission system."Information is coming from many places that many serious patients are not being admitted without the letter of the CMO,” she said.“Mr. Chief Minister, people are losing their lives while waiting for the CMO's letter. Please put an end to such rules, save the lives of people," the tweet in Hindi said."Make such a system in which serious patients can be admitted to the hospitals easily," she said.Uttar Pradesh on Monday registered the highest single-day rise in Covid-19 deaths with the disease claiming 167 more lives, while 28,287 fresh cases pushed its tally to 8,79,831.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/simplify-hospital-admission-process-of-covid-patients-priyanka-tells-adityanath-101618854444872.html

19-04-2021||India||Panel to appoint CBI director can’t meet before May 2, says govt; then explains||A top panel mandated to select a regular director for the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) will not be able to meet before May 2 due to the unavailability of Congress leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, an affidavit by the Centre in the Supreme Court has said, citing a letter from a senior official to the Centre’s top law officer KK Venugopal.The top court, which is hearing a petition on the delay in appointment of a full-time CBI director, nudged the government earlier this month to hold the meeting before May 2. The CBI has been without a regular director after Rishi Kumar Shukla demitted office on February 2 after completing his two-year term. Presently, the premier investigating agency is headed by Interim director Pravin Sinha.Under the law, the CBI director has to be appointed on the recommendation of a selection committee comprising the prime minister, the leader of the single largest Opposition Party in the Lok Sabha and the Chief Justice of India or his nominee.Lawyer Prashant Bhushan, who appeared for the petitioner NGO ‘Common Cause’, had claimed during this hearing that the delay in holding the meeting was designed to “bypass” the present Chief Justice of India SA Bobde who is retiring on April 23.The Centre had then rejected this charge and tasked Deepak Khandekar, secretary of the department of personnel and training (DoPT), to explore the possibility of holding a meeting before May 2.In his letter to Attorney General Venugopal on Sunday, Deepak Khandekar said this didn’t work out.“Undersigned Deepak Khandekar has contacted Shri Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, the Leader of the single largest Opposition party in the House of People (Indian National Congress) and Shri Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury informed that he will not be available till 2nd May 2021. Therefore, a meeting of the above said committee may be feasible to be convened only after 2nd May 2021, keeping in view the convenience of all the members of the aforesaid committee to be available to attend in person,” Khandekar’s April 18 letter said.The letter did not explain why Chowdhury was unavailable. The Congress leader, who heads the West Bengal Congress and is playing a lead role in the Bengal assembly elections, could not be immediately contacted for his comments. Voting for the last of the 8-phase elections is scheduled on April 29; the results will be declared on May 2.The Supreme Court bench comprising Justices L Nageswar Rao and S Ravindra Bhat was scheduled to hear the case on Monday but has put off the hearing to May 13. In its affidavit filed ahead of Monday's hearing, the Centre cited Khandekar's letter to KK Venugopal and underscored that Pravin Sinha, who was appointed interim director, was the senior-most police officer in the agency.The petition filed through advocate Prashant Bhushan sought directions to the Centre to initiate and complete the process of selection of CBI Director and to ensure that such process is initiated at least one month prior to the post falling vacant.The government had earlier told the top court that the meeting could not be held due to the ongoing state elections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/panel-to-appoint-cbi-director-can-t-meet-before-may-2-says-govt-then-explains-101618851272398.html

The NCB hasn’t clarified the intended destination of the drug consignment.Officials said the Indian naval ship Suvarna intercepted the Lankan boat “DU Shashila” in the high seas of the Indian Ocean on suspicion of drug trafficking and brought the boat to Kochi's Mattancherry Wharf for an extensive search by the NCB.The preliminary search did not yield anything. But a thorough hunt for the narcotics led investigators to the 340 packets of heroin concealed in ice in the boat’s cargo hold. A senior NCB official said each packet was stamped with a crown symbol with the words “KING 2021”, a practice followed by drug trafficking syndicates to brand their merchandise.According to the NCB, the consignment has a street value of ₹340 crore in India, and ₹1,750 crore in the international market.“This is a major catch not only in terms of the quantity and cost but also from the perspective of disruption of the illegal narcotics smuggling routes, which emanate from the Makran coast and flow towards the Indian, Maldivian and Sri Lankan destinations,” a defence ministry statement said.The NCB said the five Sri Lankan nationals arrested by the NCB were identified as Wimalasiri, 58, Somasiri, 58, Dharmadasa, 55, WP Ajith Ishant Pereira, 49 yrs, and Arya Ratna Pereira, 48.This is the second major drug haul by the NCB off the Kerala coast in three weeks.On 30 March, the NCB announced the seizure of 300 kg heroin from a Sri Lankan fishing vessel that had been intercepted by the Indian coast guard off the coast of Kerala’s Vizhinjam, nearly 200 km from Kochi. The Indian federal drug enforcement agency also seized five AK-47 rifles and 1,000 rounds of 9mm ammunition from the vessel.Investigations by the NCB in this case also indicated an Iranian link to the consignment. The heroin and arms consignment had been handed over to the crew of the Sri Lankan vessel in the high seas near Lakshadweep by an unidentified vessel that had come from Chabahar Port in Iran.In January also, NCB officials linked a multinational crime syndicate that had been smuggling heroin from Pakistan and Iran to a seizure of 100 kg heroin from a Lankan vessel “Shenaya Duwa” intercepted in the high seas south of Tamil Nadu’s Thoothukudi on 25 November last year. Investigations into this haul had led to the arrest of two Sri Lankan nationals, believed to be kingpins of a drug syndicate, from Chennai. These two - MMM Nawas and Mohamed Afnas - controlled the pickup and delivery of narcotic drugs from Pakistani and Iranian vessels.This international syndicate had its tentacles in Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iran, Sri Lanka, Maldives and Australia.Monday’s seizure is in line with the NCB’s assessment that indicated syndicates were increasingly turning to the sea route for smuggling narcotics since the traditional route through India’s north-western borders was becoming tougher to breach.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ncb-seizes-340-kg-heroin-concealed-in-lankan-fishing-boat-5-arrested-in-cochin-101618843351971.html
19-04-2021||India||Big narcotic haul: Navy seizes drugs worth ₹3,000 crore off Kerala coast||In a swift operation the Indian Navy on Monday seized narcotics worth ₹3,000 crore from a foreign fishing vessel which was moving suspiciously off Kerala coast, a defence spokesman said in Kochi. The vessel was later taken to Kochi and four inmates were detained. “To investigate the vessel, the ships team conducted a boarding and search operation which led to the seizure of more than 300 kilograms of narcotics substances,” he said. However, he did not disclose the exact location from where the seizure was made or the exact time of the seizure.This is the biggest seizure of the narcotic substance in the recent past and the identity of the occupants was not disclosed. The spokesman said naval ship ‘Suvarna’, during its surveillance patrolling in the Arabian Sea, encountered a fishing vessel that was moving around suspiciously and later it was force-searched. “This is a major catch, not only in terms of the quantity and the cost but also from the perspective of disruption of the illegal narcotics smuggling routes which emanate from the Makran coast and flow towards Indian, Maldivian and Sri Lankan destinations,” he said in a statement, adding that a major portion of the proceeds from the thriving drug racket was channelled to extremist and criminal activities. The destination of the contraband was suspected to be India, Sri Lanka and the Maldives. Makran is a coastal region in Baluchistan along the coast of the Gulf of Oman and notorious for the narcotic drug trade. Recently, there were intelligence reports that international drug syndicates were eying Kochi, one of the fastest-growing three-tier cities of the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/big-narcotic-haul-navy-seizes-drugs-worth-rs-3-000-crore-off-kerala-coast-101618842931988.html

19-04-2021||India||No crowds now: With akhadas pulling out, kumbh virtually over||Crowds at the ghats of Ganga in Haridwar have thinned down drastically after the key ‘akhadas’ of seers began pulling out of the Maha Kumbh, citing the surge in coronavirus numbers.Many spots on Monday wore a deserted look, an unimaginable sight during the Haridwar kumbh mela which will formally close only on April 30.Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday had appealed to the sadhus to observe the remaining duration of the kumbh only in a “symbolic” manner.There is hardly any crowd now at the bathing ghats where droves of sadhus and common devotees had gathered for a dip in the river on the ‘shahi snan’ of April 14, defying Covid-19 norms like social distancing.Most of the devotees have already left and the akhadas have been winding up their camps one after another.Panch Dashnam Joona Akhada, the largest among them, announced its exit from the kumbh mela soon after PM Modi’s appeal to sadhus, referring to the rise in coronavirus cases.Niranjani, Anand, Avahan, Agni and Kinnar sects too ended their participation in what is perhaps the largest religious congregation in the world.“Most of the sanyasi akhadas have vacated their camps. Only 1,000-2,000 seers of the six Bairagi akhadas are still in the mela kshetra waiting for the last shahi snan slated for April 27," Uttarakhand DGP Ashok Kumar said."After the shahi snans of April 12 and 14 several akhadas left and not much is left in the Kumbh area. Practically, the kumbh kshetra is empty now and no one is expected to come from outside," he said.Traditionally, the last shahi snan held on Ram Navami is a main event for the Bairagi sect and not for the others.Altogether, Uttarakhand reported over 2,000 fresh Covid cases during the past four days with Dehradun and Haridwar districts being the largest contributors to the tally.DGP Kumar, however, refused to accept the argument that the kumbh mela is a ‘super-spreader’ of the virus because of the huge gathering, calling the theory "entirely fake"."We have data to prove that it is a complete lie,” he claimed.“The Covid positivity rate in Haridwar is less than two per cent. If 50 out of a total of 10,000 sadhus test positive for Covid, it is 0.5 per cent whereas three lakh people tested positive for Covid in Maharashtra in a span of five days,” he added.But Haridwar's chief medical officer S K Jha said over 150 seers had tested positive for Covid from April 1 to 18.Chief Minister Tirath Singh Rawat on Sunday said the shahi snan at the kumbh has been conducted successfully with everyone’s cooperation. The prime minister’s appeal to seers has also evoked a positive response from the sadhus, he added.Agni Akhada secretary Sampoornanand Brahmachari said the decision on a final kumbh immersion of deities was taken after Modi’s appeal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-crowds-now-with-akhadas-pulling-out-kumbh-virtually-over-101618840368761.html

19-04-2021||India||Call to cancel Bihu functions in Assam amid Covid-19 surge||Following calls by prominent personalities and political parties for cancelling cultural events associated with a month-long Rongali Bihu events starting mid- April in Assam amid the continuously rising Covid-19 infections, the state government has said it will soon take a decision on the matter.“Given the deteriorating situation, all Bihu functions need to be cancelled forthright. Hope the government of Assam will take a considered decision,” national award-winning filmmaker Utpal Borpujari tweeted on Monday. He is one among many who are urging for cancellation of Bihu events through their social media messages.Dr Navanil Barua, a prominent neurosurgeon and columnist said the government shouldn’t have allowed holding of Bihu functions in the first place. “The state government was informed by ICMR in February itself about (the) presence of new strains of Covid in the state. With that in mind, the elections should have been postponed. But nothing of that sort happened. If Bihu was allowed keeping in mind hundreds of artists who rely on these functions for income, it should have been held online, something on the pattern of IPL, without audience at the venues. The government can still do that,” he said.In past weeks, Covid-19 cases in Assam have increased from single digits daily to three digits. On Sunday, the state recorded 639 new cases—including 354 in Kamrup (Metropolitan) district which includes Guwahati-- and 6 deaths, taking the number of active cases to 5,268 with the positivity rate climbing to 2.74%.While the situation in Assam may not look threatening at the moment, the new Covid-19 strain has led to a record surge in infection nationally with several states reporting new daily peaks during the second wave of the disease.Popular singer Angaraag ‘Papon’ Mahanta underlined this point during a Bihu event on Sunday“If you compare with some other parts of India, Assam is still in a better position. But we need to be careful,” he said, adding, “You guys are listening to my songs with your ears. So there’s no harm in covering your faces with masks. We can save ourselves, our homes and Assam if we wear masks.”Earlier on Sunday, health minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said if any district had more than 300 active Covid-19 cases, “Bihu functions and other events won’t be allowed to be held there”. He added that a formal decision on this will be taken on Monday.Last year, the lockdown imposed after Covid-19 outbreak put a lid on the cultural events. This year, with assembly polls getting over on April 6, the state government allowed celebrations, but with restrictions.Besides the usual Covid-19 protocols, the organizers of these functions were asked to get themselves tested for Covid-19 three days prior to and also after the event. All functions, which usually continue till early mornings, were asked to wrap up by 11 pm and organisers were asked to sanitise venues twice, once before the event and again after it.While some organizers decided not to hold events, many events are being held at present all over the state but the deadline for functions to get over as well as other safety measures are getting flouted in many places. On April 14, the first day of the functions, prominent singer Zubeen Garg took to the stage after 11 am and performed till 12:45 am. The singer has since restricted his performances till the deadline set by government. Another singer Bipin Chowdang also performed after 11 pm on the first day of the events.The authorities have now decided to act tough against defaulters.“Today onwards we appeal to all Bihu celebration committees of Assam to strictly follow Covid protocols and wind up before 11 pm without fail. No excuses. From tonight, strict legal action will be taken to save human lives,” Assam Police director general of police (DGP) Bhaskar Jyoti Mahanta tweeted on Sunday.Senior Congress leader and Lok Sabha MP Pradyut Bordoloi said the state government was guilty of “criminal negligence and dereliction of duty”. He claimed the state government itself flouted all Covid norms during the assembly elections and thus could not stop Bihu events citing the disease.“. ...They allowed these functions to be held by issuing some absurd SOPs like time limit of 11 pm with complete disregard to human lives. The harm has already been done. But now strictest measures should be enforced to ensure that these functions don’t continue to add to the health crisis looming in the state,” saidMd Aminul Islam, organising secretary of All India United Democratic Front said the government should stop Bihu functions held on stage to ensure safety of people.“It is very unfortunate that the government allowed Bihu functions at a time when the Covid-19 in other states was already alarming. We will love Bihu as it is the life thread of all Assamese and we become sentimental about it. It was always going to be impossible to maintain strict social distancing and other measures at places where thousands gather,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/call-to-cancel-bihu-functions-in-assam-amid-covid-19-surge-101618839992775.html

Some might be good but those with no scientific evidence, Ayurvedic, Homeopathic or anything else, could harm the liver. In an attempt to avoid Covid, you could develop liver-related issues,” Dr Sarin said, according to news agency ANI.Read more: Railways to run ‘Oxygen Express’ amid high demand from statesILBS, which is a mono-superspeciality hospital for liver and biliary diseases, is located in New Delhi and is a dedicated centre for the diagnosis and management of liver and biliary diseases.Earlier in the day, AIIMS director Randeep Guleria also asked doctors to exercise caution while prescribing Remdesivir to patients saying that the drug is not a ‘magic bullet’.“It is important to understand that Remdesivir is not a magic bullet and is not a drug that decreases mortality. We may use it due to lack of an antiviral drug and it is useless if given at an early state to asymptomatic individuals or to patients with mild symptoms. It is also ineffective if administered late,” Guleria was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.India, which is currently facing the second wave of coronavirus, witnessed yet another record rise in its daily cases of the viral infection as 273,810 fresh cases were reported across the country on Monday, according to the Union ministry of health and family welfare (MoHFW).

19-04-2021||India||Jaishankar defends India’s move to export Covid-19 vaccines, says prioritising our people||Minister of external affairs S Jaishankar defended India’s decision to export Covid-19 vaccines to other countries at a time when the cases are surging in the country. He also "pushed" the big countries to ensure smooth supply of raw materials needed for manufacturing of Covid-19 vaccines in India.“As a foreign minister, I'm pushing other countries, particularly some big countries, saying - look, please keep the raw materials flowing for vaccines to be made in India,” news agency ANI quoted Jaishankar as saying at a conclave.“If you ask why are you exporting (vaccines) at all, somebody will ask - why am I exporting to India. That is so short-sighted. Only non-serious, irresponsible people can make that argument,” he added, according to ANI.The Union minister highlighted the global supply chains saying the societies in general are not autonomous entities but rely on each other to survive.“The fact is that there are global supply chains, very few things are made exclusively in one geography, very few societies can say we are autonomous of our reliance on others,” Jaishankar stated.India’s largest vaccine manufacturer Serum Institute of India, who has been tasked with producing the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid shot, has been experiencing a crunch of raw materials.

The authorities have hired additional eight hands to man the center housed at the directorate of public health (DPH) in Chennai.A helpline staff said it takes six people in each of the three shifts to respond to about 1,800 to 2,000 calls received daily these days. Dr Praveen Sunder, a new recruit, was asked to leave his field duty to man the helpline’s need for manpower.“Because of the surge in cases we are getting more calls, so I was brought in from April 1,” says Sunder. As a doctor employed with the directorate, Sunder was involved in distribution of medicines for Covid treatment and spreading awareness last year. Now, on the helpline duty, he claims he answers 100-150 calls during his eight hour shift. On an average, the Center has received more than a 1,000 calls every day since mid-March, said another helpline staff.The calls to the helpline are handled by doctors, health inspectors and other staff of the public health directorate, who share relevant information with the callers following the Covid-19 guidelines released periodically by the state government. A television plays out news 24 hours at the center, allowing the shift in-charge to update staff on the latest Covid-related regulations and other developments.Most calls that Sunder and his colleagues receive these days are queries on vaccines and e-pass rules. “They call to find out about any precautionary measures to take before getting vaccinated, what kind of side-effects they can expect and many people are also confused over the interval between the two doses,” said Sunder. “Some of them also call if they have a headache or any sort of pain after getting vaccinated. If they test positive, they ask if they can remain in home quarantine and when they should take a CT (Computed Tomography)”.However, when people in medical emergency situations tend to call Tamil Nadu’s 108 ambulance service, he said.The helpline also receives calls from other states and even countries to know if there will be a lockdown in Tamil Nadu and if they require an e-pass to enter. “People call us from other countries like the UK and Canada before they plan their travel,” says Sunder.His colleague who did not wish to be named has been working in the control room since last March when Tamil Nadu reported its first infection. She said the number of calls had increased to the levels seen between March and July last year, adding that in February she used to answer less than 35 calls, which has more than doubled to around 100 now.Tamil Nadu reported 6,993 daily cases on July 27 at the peak of the infections last year, which has been surpassed this year during the second wave with record 7,819 cases registered on April 14.“We are like a hub,” she says. “When we get specific queries on testing centres or bed availability, we connect the callers to our district centres.”However, there are a few complaints with the helplines at the district centres. For instance, a resident of Chengalpattu district, who didn’t wish to be named, said he called the local helpline-- 044-27427412 twice to complain against an infected person, who was roaming freely within their apartment complex. “We have elders and kids who live here and I’m worried,” he said. “They just forwarded my complaint to the local municipality to fumigate the place and put a notice in that person’s house, but till now, no one has turned up to take action.”Apart from the general helpline, the Greater Chennai Corporation has reopened a tele-counselling helpline for those in home isolation. It has a hundred parallel lines to ensure the helpline isn’t engaged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tamil-nadu-brings-more-hands-for-covid-helpline-as-cases-surge-101618837171994.html

He advised doctors that the Remdesivir drug does not reduce mortality and is of no use if given to people with mild symptoms.“It is important to understand that Remdesivir is not a magic bullet and is not a drug that decreases mortality. We may use it due to lack of an antiviral drug and it is useless if given at an early state to asymptomatic individuals or to patients with mild symptoms. It is also ineffective if administered late,” Guleria was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.Guleria also suggested doctors to ensure that Remdesivir should be given to patients who are hospitalised. “Remdesivir should only be given to patients who are hospitalised, have reported a fall in oxygen saturation and have infiltrates on the chest X-ray or CT-scan.”A shortage of Remdesivir injection has put several state governments on alert. Maharashtra reported a shortage of Remdesivir injections in several districts. Earlier on Monday, the Nagpur bench of the Bombay high court directed the state government to ensure that Nagpur receives 10,000 injections within 8pm on Monday. The Delhi government also said that the two teams of officers have been deployed to monitor procurement and supply of Remdesivir drugs as the national Capital also faced a shortage.NITI Aayog member (health) Dr VK Paul on Saturday said that the production of Remdesivir has been scaled up to meet the current demands. He said, “Remdesivir production had gone down, but now from 26 lakh vials per month it has been scaled up to 40 lakh vials per month and we are aiming to produce 76 lakh vials per month.”Randeep Guleria also highlighted that doctors should ensure that medicines are given in the right time and right combination. Guleria also highlighted that plasma therapy has been ineffective in curing patients. “Studies have shown that plasma therapy has a limited role and is not of much use. Less than 2% Covid-19 patients require Tocilizumab but it is being used a lot these days. Majority of patients with mild symptoms or those who are asymptomatic will improve with treatment given to symptomatic patients.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/remdesivir-not-a-magic-bullet-doesn-t-reduce-mortality-says-guleria-101618834660884.html
19-04-2021||India||Covid-19: IOC to supply oxygen to hospitals in Delhi, Haryana, Punjab||After Reliance Industries Ltd, state-owned Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) and Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) have begun diverting oxygen produced at their refineries to supplement the availability of medical oxygen in states worst hit by COVID-19.In a statement, IOC said it has "begun the supply of 150 tonnes of oxygen at no cost to various hospitals in Delhi, Haryana and Punjab.""The first batch of the lifesaver medical grade oxygen was dispatched today to Maha Durga Charitable Trust Hospital, New Delhi," it said. "Delhi is already facing an oxygen emergency situation."In the face of a massive surge in demand for medical oxygen during the second wave of the pandemic, IOC has diverted the high-purity oxygen used in its Mono Ethylene Glycol (MEG) unit to produce medical-grade liquid oxygen at its Panipat refinery and petrochemical complex in Haryana.The throughput of the unit has also been scaled down for a more critical cause.In a separate statement, BPCL said it has started supply of 100 tonnes of oxygen at no cost."The company will be supplying around 100 tonnes per month," it said.With average daily cases of COVID-19 rising again since last one month, the demand for oxygen has significantly risen. In fact, in most parts of the country, the cases are hitting new peak, thereby disrupting the demand-supply scenario for medical oxygen.Last week, Reliance's twin oil refineries in Jamnagar in Gujarat through minor process modification converted industrial oxygen into medical-use oxygen that can be administered to COVID-19 patients low on oxygen. In all, 100 tonnes of oxygen is being supplied from the Jamnagar refineries free of cost.BPCL is also supplying 1.5 tonnes per day of medical oxygen to Kerala from its Kochi Refinery.Last year, BPCL had supplied around 25 tonnes of medical oxygen when the average daily cases had risen in October-November.The Kochi Refinery has a provision to produce and store liquid oxygen of 99.7 per cent purity.Oil refineries can produce limited volumes of industrial oxygen in air-separation plants meant for nitrogen production. Scrubbing out other gases such as carbon dioxide can convert it into medical-use oxygen with 99.9 per cent purity.Reliance operates the world's largest oil refining complex at Jamnagar in Gujarat.IOC Chairman S M Vaidya reiterated the firm's unstinted support to the country at this critical hour in every possible way."All through the pandemic, our prime focus has been to ensure the supply of essential fuels 24X7. We have also stepped up the production of raw material for PPEs, and we are now providing lifesaving medical oxygen to hospitals."Our expertise and assets, including refineries, pipelines, petrochemical units, bottling plants, terminals and aviation fuel stations, will continue to serve the people despite the stiff challenges”, he added.As the COVID-19 cases in the country continue to rise, the demand for medical-grade oxygen too is growing rapidly. "The current initiative by IOC aims at supporting the states in fighting the battle against COVID-19," the statement added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-ioc-to-supply-oxygen-to-hospitals-in-delhi-haryana-punjab-101618834513512.html

There is no excess rate of young people testing positive,” ANI quoted Dr Paul as saying. He also said that air-borne transmission of the disease is more prevalent than the surface borne transmission.Dr Paul also said that the production of the Remdesivir drug, which currently has a high demand across the country, has been scaled up. “As for Remdesivir production, it had gone down but now from 26 lakh vials per month, it has been scaled up to 40 lakh vials per month while aiming for 76 lakh vials per month,” ANI quoted him as saying.Also read | India's second wave of Covid-19 'less severe', no change in death rate: ICMR DGMany experts have said that more younger people are being infected during the second wave of the pandemic. Earlier on Sunday, chief of Genestrings Diagnostic Centre Gauri Agarwal said that “A lot of young people [are] testing Covid positive as compared to old people. Symptoms are different this time. Many are complaining of dry mouth, gastrointestinal issues, nausea, loose tools, red eyes and headache. Everyone doesn't complain of fever,” ANI reported.On April 13, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal too had said that younger people are being infected with the disease in the national capital. “As per the data of last 10-15 days, 65 per cent of the patients are below 45 years of age. Your health and life are very important to us. So, I would like to appeal to the youth to step out of the house only when it is necessary and follow all Covid protocols strictly,” Kejriwal said.Meanwhile, India reported 273,810 new infections on Monday, its highest in a 24-hour span so far.

With this find, the number of bat species in India increases to 130, and in Meghalaya, to 66. The species, Eudiscopus denticulus, was found by a team of scientists led by Uttam Saikia from Shillong office of Zoological Survey of India and scientists from a few European natural history museums at Lailad close to Nongkhyllem Wildlife Sanctuary in July last year. The finding about the “very specialised bamboo-dwelling bat species” has been published in the recent issue of Revue Suisse de Zoologie, a bi-annual journal published by the Geneva Museum and the Swiss Zoological Society. “The bat species is very distinctive in appearance with prominent disk-like pads in the thumb and bright orange colouration,” said a press note on the finding. “From the modifications in the feet, it was presumed to be a bamboo-dwelling species which was later identified as a disk-footed bat. This bat is reported to roost inside bamboo internodes aided by their adhesive disks,” it added. Till now, the species was recorded in few localities in Southern China, Vietnam, Thailand and Myanmar. The location in Meghalaya where the species was found is nearly 1,000 km westward of its earlier known areas.Also Read | From Rajasthan to Delhi, states ramp up measures to battle Covid-19The researchers found that though several bamboo-dwelling bat species are common throughout Southeast Asia, this particular species is rare and found only in a few localities worldwide. Comparison of the DNA sequence of the species found in Meghalaya with specimens from Vietnam revealed that despite the vast distance separating the two specimens, they were found to be identical. The researchers have hypothesized that populations of the species from Meghalaya and Vietnam may have very recent common origin and all existing bat populations expanded from the same region following recent expansion of man-made bamboo forests. “From analysis of the very high frequency echolocation calls of the Meghalaya individual, the scientists noted that the cell structure is suitable for orientation in a cluttered environment like inside bamboo grooves,” the note said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indias-first-disk-footed-bat-recorded-in-meghalaya-dwells-in-bamboo-grooves-101618832851856.html

Kochi police commissioner CH Nagaraju said a preliminary inquiry revealed that the man wanted to kill himself and the daughter after he suffered a financial setback in his business in Pune. He allegedly suffocated his daughter on March 20 and dumped her body in the river. He also allegedly tried to kill himself but survived, said the police.

Police have moved an application in a local court, requesting custody of the man for two weeks. Police recovered his car from Coimbatore in Tamil Nadu. “We have information that he travelled to three-four states to dodge police and there were many attempts to mislead investigators,” said the commissioner. The man reportedly told the police that he tried to die by suicide by slitting his vein but later took medical help. In Goa, he told his interrogators that he jumped into the sea but was rescued by lifeguards. But police suspect these statements are false. An electronic equipment dealer, the accused left Pune a couple of years ago and settled in Kochi after his business suffered losses.

As I mentioned that the symptoms of joint ache, fatigue, muscle ache, loss of smell, or sore throat are much less compared to the first wave. However, shortness of breath is higher in this wave," Dr Bhargava said, reported news agency ANI.Also read: PM Modi to interact with leading doctors after explosive surge in Covid-19 casesHowever, the ICMR DG said there is no difference seen in the rate of fatalities between the first and the second wave.Pointing out at major loopholes in India's fight against the viral contagion, Dr Bhargava said, "We have had a tremendous amount of laxity and Covid-19 inappropriate behaviour was seen."It is not yet clear if the surge in infection spread and cases is the result of the double mutant found in India or the higher rate of transmissibility, the ICMR chief said.He also stressed that the RT-PCR is a gold standard test that measures two or more genes in the body, and there is no chance of missing the detection of a Covid-19 mutant through the test."I would like to emphasise that the RT-PCR test that we are utilising, they measure two or more genes and they never miss a test...

A campaign of testing will follow in rural areas since the cases are increasing there. Proper arrangements to be made for sending migrants to isolation centres and hospitals,” Baghel said. He instructed the health department to ensure continuous availability of testing kits, oxygen cylinders, Remdesivir and other necessary medicines and devices at all Covid treatment facilities and ordered immediate recruitment of necessary medical staff in districts. The number of active cases in Chhattisgarh has reached 128,019. The state is among the top three—other two being Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh-- with more than a hundred thousand active cases. Two days back, the Central government asked it to increase the number of Covid beds to meet with the crisis. Some Covid-19 patients HT spoke to, said they were struggling to get oxygen beds and Remdesivir. “Doctors prescribed Remdesivir injections to my uncle two days back, but the injections are not available even today,” said Sonu, Pandey, who is getting treated for Covid-19 in a private hospital along with his uncle. A volunteer helping Covid patients spoke about the crunch of oxygen beds in Raipur, the state capital. “Only two out of 10 patients needing oxygen beds get it on time, rest are kept waiting,” said Tirath Sahu. Last Friday, the state government decided to reserve 70% of oxygen beds at all private hospitals for Covid-19 patients. A day earlier on Thursday, it said it had distributed another consignment of 8,800 Remdesivir injections to different hospitals and were awaiting the delivery of 90,000 injections within a week.Chhattisgarh reported 12,345 fresh Covid patients and 170 deaths on Sunday, taking the infection count to 544,840 and the death toll to 5,908.

19-04-2021||India||Harsh Vardhan lists 'factual inaccuracies' in Manmohan Singh's letter to PM: Read excerpts here||A day after Manmohan Singh wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi over the country’s vaccination strategy, Union health minister Harsh Vardhan on Monday responded to the senior Congress leader. Harsh Vardhan requested Singh to ask his party workers to also follow the same advice in their own respective states. In the letter, the Union health minister apprised Singh of India's "biggest and fastest" vaccination drive in the world and said "you advise not to get tempted to go by absolute numbers, but to go by percentage of the population "is not incorrect." "However, I am sure that you will agree with me that this is a practice that must be followed uniformly and junior members of your party too must follow your advice," he wrote.On Sunday, Singh wrote to PM Modi in the backdrop of an unprecedented rise in Covid-19 cases. He asked PM Modi for resisting the "temptation" to look at absolute numbers vaccinated, instead, he suggested that the government should focus on the percentage of the population vaccinated. Singh also stated, "Centre should tell Covid vaccine orders placed for next 6 months, how vaccines will be distributed to states." In one of the suggestion, Singh wrote that the Centre may retain 10 per cent for distribution based on emergency needs "but other than that, states should have a clear signal of likely availability so that they can plan their rollout."Harsh Vardhan posted his letter on Twitter as said that "history will be kinder to you Dr Manmohan Singh ji if your offer of ‘constructive cooperation and valuable advice was followed by his party leaders as well. "It is saddening, Dr Singh, that while you very well understand the importance of vaccination as an important method of fighting the COVID-19 battle, people in responsible positions in your party as well as in the state governments formed by your party do not seem to share your view," Harsh Vardhan said.Read key points here:"The emphasis you have laid on vaccination as an important tool to fight COVID-19 is well taken, which is exactly why India launched the world's biggest vaccination drive and also became the fastest in the world to reach the milestones of 10, 11 and 12 crore administered doses.""It cannot be that the discussion on total cases, active cases or mortality is based on absolute numbers, which the Congress party often tries to do, but the vaccination numbers continue to be touted as a percentage of the population covered. ""It is saddening, Dr Singh, that while you very well understand the importance of vaccination as an important method of fighting the COVID-19 battle, people in responsible positions in your party as well as in the state governments formed by your party do not seem to share your view. Shouldn't it be a matter of pride that India is perhaps the only developing country to have 2 vaccines?""Let alone thanking scientists, many Congress members and Congress-ruled slate governments have taken extraordinary interest in spreading falsehoods regarding the efficacy of these vaccines, thereby fuelling vaccine hesitancy, and playing with the lives of our countrymen.""The irresponsible public pronouncements made by some of your leaders have resulted in a below national average vaccination coverage of senior citizens and even front-line workers in some of the Congress-ruled states.""However, it does seem that those who drafted your letter or advised you, have done a great disservice to your standing by misleading you regarding material that is already in public domain.""The same is the case with your suggestion regarding providing funds and other concessions to augment vaccine manufacturing This decision had also been taken many days before receipt of your letter and multiple vaccine manufacturing entities have been funded by the government to immediately enhance production."Vaccination drive in IndiaThe cumulative number of Covid-19 vaccine doses administered in the country has crossed 123 million on Monday as part of the world's largest vaccination drive, said the ministry of health and family Welfare.

The UK government said last week it had decided to reduce the length of Johnson’s visit following discussions with the Indian side. The Indian mission in London had announced the visit was to begin on April 25. “In the light of the current Coronavirus situation, Prime Minister Boris Johnson will not be able to travel to India next week. Instead, Prime Ministers [Narendra] Modi and Johnson will speak later this month to agree and launch their ambitious plans for the future partnership between the UK and India,” said a spokesperson for the UK prime minister’s office. Johnson and Modi will remain in “regular contact beyond this, and look forward to meeting in person later this year”, the spokesperson added. Also Read | UK defends ex-PM Cameron as scale of lobbying scandal grows furtherExternal affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi added the decision to call off the visit had been made by mutual agreement. “The two sides will be holding a virtual meeting in the coming days to launch plans for a transformed India-UK relationship,” he said. Modi and Johnson “attach the highest importance to taking the India-UK partnership to its fullest potential and propose to remain in close touch in this regard and look forward to an in-person meeting later in the year”, Bagchi said. In January, Johnson cancelled a visit to India to be chief guest at the Republic Day celebrations in order to remain in Britain to focus on his government’s response to a new Coronavirus variant that was spreading rapidly at the time. While unveiling an integrated review of defence, development and foreign policy in March, the UK announced Johnson would travel to India at the end of April as part of the Britain’s tilt towards the Indo-Pacific. Monday’s development came against the backdrop of mounting criticism in Britain for Johnson’s plans to go ahead with the trip to New Delhi at a time when India is witnessing a massive surge in Covid-19 infections. The country recorded more than 270,000 cases and more than 1,600 deaths on Sunday. Experts also called on the UK government to add India to its “red list” of travel restrictions following the detection of 77 cases of the Indian “double mutant” Covid-19 variant. Experts from Imperial College said the discovery of this variant should lead to India being placed in the “red list”, under which incoming travellers are subject to hotel quarantine of 10 days. On Sunday, the main opposition Labour Party joined calls for Johnson to cancel his visit to India. “I can’t see why the prime minister can’t conduct his business with the Indian government via Zoom,” said Labour’s shadow communities secretary Steve Reed. “The prime minister, like all of us in public life, needs to try and set an example. I’d much rather the prime minister did it by Zoom rather than travelling to India,” Reed told Sky News.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uk-pm-johnson-calls-off-visit-to-india-over-covid-19-situation-101618825470981.html

The EU is India’s largest trading partner.India and many European countries, along with the US, have sought to distance their next generation telecom infrastructure from companies including Huawei Technologies Co. and ZTE Corp. amid concerns over their links with the Chinese government.Nations including the US, UK, Australia and India have raised red flags about Chinese majors participating in building the networks. Chinese suppliers have been shut out of recent telecom auctions in India. While the US and Japan have announced their intention to invest in 5G research, the UK plans to build an alliance of democracies for safer adoption of the technology that’s expected to spur growth post-pandemic and add $1.3 trillion to the global economy by 2030.There’s renewed focus on building common standards to ensure security across the 5G value chain, Vestager said. Standards would include agreeing on technical aspects like radio spectrum bands and interface technologies to be used by 5G networks and creating level-playing fields for local and smaller companies.“It has been part of discussions we have had so far,” she said. “And I would hope that this would be a common approach.

19-04-2021||India||Clinical symptoms of Covid-19, CT scans/X-rays should be used to rule out false negatives: Experts||Amid a staggering surge in Covid-19 cases, India's top experts on Monday said RT-PCR tests detect coronavirus in around 80 per cent of the cases, so clinical features and CT scans/chest X-rays should be used to rule out false negatives in symptomatic patients followed by a repeat test after 24 hours.Amid SARS COV-2 'variants of concern' circulating, they said RT-PCR tests do not miss mutations as the ones being used in India target more than two genes. According to government data till April 15, a total of 1,189 samples have tested positive for 'variants of concern' of SARS COV-2 in India which include 1,109 samples with the UK variant, 79 samples with South African variant and one sample with the Brazil variant.Based on ICMR data, the current variants are also being picked up by the RT-PCR tests. The RT-PCR test has sensitivity of around 80 per cent and therefore 20 per cent of the cases can still be missed out."Also, if the sample is not properly taken or if the test is done too early when the viral load is low, it may come out negative. So, if a person is symptomatic, a combination of clinical features, laboratory reports, CT/chest X-ray can be used for presumptive diagnosis of Covid-19 and treatment should be started accordingly. The test should also be repeated after 24 hours," AIIMS Director Dr Randeep Guleria told PTI.Dr Samiran Panda, the Head of Epidemiology and Communicable Diseases at the Indian Council of Medical Research, said the mutants -- variants from the UK, Brazil and South Africa -- are not able to evade the diagnostic RT-PCR testing that is being conducted in India."In India, we have to be able to detect two or more genes of virus so if mutation happens on one area then the RT-PCR test kits will be able to capture it and it is capturing. However, some of the infections will remain undetected irrespective of the mutations happening," Panda said.Moreover, all the mutants have been identified from these tests only, he said.Clinical symptoms and CT scan reports should be the guiding factor for treatment rather than relying only on the RT-PCR test which has a sensitivity of around 80 per cent, another senior doctor said.Even the rapid antigen test has a sensitivity of only 40 per cent, he said, adding, "So many patients will be missed if we rely only upon these tests."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/clinical-symptoms-of-covid-19-ct-scans-x-rays-should-be-used-to-rule-out-false-negatives-experts-101618821168010.html

He clarified that the decision regarding fast-tracking foreign-made vaccines that have been approved by credible authorities had been taken before his suggestion.In his five-point letter to the PM, Singh said, “The key to our fight against Covid-19 must be ramping up the vaccination effort. We must resist the temptation to look at the absolute numbers being vaccinated, and focus instead on the percentage of the population vaccinated.” The former Prime Minister had urged the government to reveal the system of distribution of vaccines among states in a transparent way.

Both countries deliberated on disengagement of troops at Gogra-Hot Springs and Despang plains, agreeing to maintain stability on the ground to discourage any new incidents from cropping up and resolve outstanding issues in an "expeditious manner"Congress leader Ajay Maken had criticized the disengagement talks between India and China. "Why has the disengagement talks as promised by the Defence Minister on remaining friction points not yielded any results for India," Maken had said on April 18.The border standoff between the armies of Indian and China was the result of a flare-up on May 5 last year following a violent clash at Pangong Tso in Ladakh last year.After military and diplomatic level deliberations both sides ultimately withdrew troops from the north and south banks of Pangong lake in February. India has always maintained that a resolution of the issues in the remaining two friction points of Gogra-Hot Springs and Despang plains is instrumental to the maintenance of cordial relations between both the countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chinese-occupation-of-gogra-hot-springs-depsang-plains-a-direct-threat-to-india-s-strategic-interests-tweets-rahul-gandhi-chinese-occupation-of-gogra-hot-springs-depsang-plains-a-direct-threat-to-india-s-strategic-interests-tweets-rahul-gandhi-101618817260806.html

19-04-2021||India||India, France, UAE to test combat skills at Varuna naval exercise from Sunday||Indian Navy warships will join the French flagship Charles de Gaulle carrier aircraft carrier along with United Arab Emirates (UAE) Navy for the three-day Varuna trilateral exercise to jointly test combat skills and war game in the Persian Gulf area starting April 25, people familiar with the matter said.This is the first time that the UAE is participating in the Varuna maritime exercise. India and France have been holding the exercise since 1993; it was christened Varuna in 2001.Officials said the Indian Navy’s sole aircraft carrier INS Vikramaditya would not join the exercise since it is under maintenance. But the Indian Navy’s participation will seek to make up for INS Vikramaditya’s absence by sending two to three destroyers (possibly led by INS Kolkata, the lead ship of the navy’s Kolkata-class stealth guided-missile destroyers) and frigates, an attack submarine, a P-8I maritime reconnaissance and anti-submarine warfare aircraft. The Charles de Gaulle carrier strike force comprises two frigates and a replenishment tanker.The French aircraft carrier and its strike group have been in the neighbourhood for weeks; Charles de Gaulle arrived in the Arabian Sea in mid-March for operations relating to Afghanistan and has held dual operations with the United States aircraft supercarrier Dwight D. Eisenhower Carrier Strike Group. According to the two navies, the two strike groups, which are conducting dual operations, are cooperating at levels of integration that has been “rarely achieved in the past”.USS Eisenhower carrier strike group is part of the fifth fleet, whose area of operations extends from the Red Sea to parts of the Indian Ocean. The US carrier-based squadrons of F-18 Super Hornet aircraft and E-2c Hawkeye airborne early warning aircraft tested war skills with French Rafale M fighters in the Arabian Sea on April 13.While the fledgling UAE Navy will be part of the Varuna war games, Indian and French naval warships will be involved in complex manoeuvres in the north Arabian Sea and the Persian Gulf by testing interoperability skills in sub-surface, surface and aerial dimensions.Just as France is considered the oldest US ally, India and France have very deep defence cooperation and converge on the Indo-Pacific doctrine to ensure that no power unilaterally blocks the freedom of navigation from the Gulf of Aden to the western shores of the United States. Both India and France have very close ties with UAE.Like the four-nation Quad grouping, India-France and Australia have overlapping security objectives in the Indo-Pacific even though the level of war gaming between major maritime powers such as the US, France and India takes a bigger dimension with advanced skill testing and intelligence sharing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-france-uae-to-test-combat-skills-at-varuna-naval-exercise-from-sunday-101618814430812.html

Govt lists coronavirus risk factorsMishra said that the second wave was very much expected as the country is witnessing an increasing number of Covid-19 positive case. "On many occasions over the past few months, many medical intellectuals, have been saying that the virus and its impact is just low and has not been completely wiped out. We should have been a bit more prepared for this kind of situation," he said, according to ANI. "In infections like Covid-19, it is quite common that there would be a second wave as the virus mutates and whichever of the mutated variant virus is stronger will spread faster. There have been a lot of new variants that have emerged. More people will be infected with the mutated variant in India, if they don't adhere to the Covid guidelines," he added.Also read | Covid-19: Can people catch coronavirus again?Experts have said the new variant, which has a so-called double mutation, is thought to be fueling India’s deadlier new wave of Covid-19 cases that has made it the world’s second worst-hit country, surpassing Brazil again. The new variant, called B.1.617, was initially detected in India with two mutations -- the E484Q and L452R. It was first reported late last year by a scientist in India and more details were presented before the World Health Organization (WHO) on Monday.Also Watch | Time to put vaccines at medical stores to beat Covid wave? Top doctors answerCovid-19 cases are rising every day because people have stopped taking care of themselves by not putting on masks, and thinking that it has gone completely, he said. "Though the vaccine is a very important tool to defeat the pandemic, people must still remember to follow the Covid guidelines as the virus can be spread from even those who have been vaccinated. No matter what variant comes, it cannot spread if we stick to the Covid guidelines," he added. "After a thorough air sampling of the coronavirus, it has been found that the virus can spread through air. It can move upto 20 feet in a closed area. Wearing a mask can keep one 80 to 90 per cent safe. If the other person is also wearing a mask, then one can be 99 per cent safe," he added.Also read | Covid-19: What you need to know todayMishra said that it is extremely dangerous when there is a large gathering of people especially in places like Kumbh Mela and political gatherings as it is a perfect place from the virus to spread to many other people.

19-04-2021||India||Air pollution and Covid-19||The Lancet assessment of April 15 tells us that Covid-19 is almost certainly airborne: “an individual could potentially be infected when they inhale aerosols produced when an infected person exhales, speaks, shouts, sings, sneezes, or coughs,” it said. It reminds me of indoor air pollution. The virus barely gives us time to react, while air pollution can take months, even years. This section seemed to gesture to our pre-pandemic pollution thinking. “Reducing airborne transmission of virus requires measures to avoid inhalation of infectious aerosols…air filtration…use of masks whenever indoors, attention to mask quality and fit.”Covid is the new air pollution in disguise. It is a murderous contaminant. A few lessons are in order for the months after this is over. First, urban Indians should also worry about indoor air pollution. The grey smog outside is only half the story. Second, if Covid claimed over 150,000 lives in a year, air pollution, per estimates, could have claimed almost 120,000. Third, the quality of housing is vital. Those in one-roomed, poorly ventilated shanties cannot isolate. But, pre-Covid too, the kitchen was the most polluted spot in most homes. In all scenarios, the poor in one roomed homes are most vulnerable. We shouldn’t abandon our cooking styles, but let’s redesign housing for safer air. The new study is not just about Covid. It must reform our thinking around indoor air pollution in post-pandemic times.(The writer is the founder and director of the Chintan Environmental Research and Action Group)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/air-pollution-and-covid19-101618802261627.html

19-04-2021||India||Every third minute, 1 person dies of Covid-19 in Maharashtra||Maharashtra, the worst-hit state in the country battling the second wave of the coronavirus pandemic, adds more than 2,000 infections to its tally every hour, according to data analysis. The analysis shows 2,859 people are contracting the coronavirus disease every hour and one person succumbs to Covid-19 every third minute on average. Maharashtra continued to record a spurt in daily cases of the coronavirus disease as the state added 68,631 new patients on Sunday, according to the daily health bulletin by the state health department.It was the first time that the state recorded such a huge spike in a single day, which has pushed its tally to 38,39,338. The state also reported 503 fatalities, pushing the death toll to breach the 60,000-mark to 60,473. Out of the latest additions, 8468 new cases were reported from Mumbai city alone and 53 died due to Covid-19 in the span of 24 hours. The death toll in Mumbai has now reached 12,354.As Maharashtra remains the worst-hit state in the second wave of the pandemic, it is functioning under strict Covid-19 induced restrictions including weekend lockdown and Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC). The state's upward trajectory in Covid cases has pushed the health infrastructure to stretch beyond limits.Amid the shortage of oxygen in the state, the Indian Railways announced 'oxygen express' trains that will transport liquid medical oxygen and oxygen cylinders to Maharashtra and other destinations. On Saturday, the railways formulated guidelines to allow transportation of liquid medical oxygen in cryogenic tankers after the Maharashtra government and Madhya Pradesh made a request to meet the shortage of the gas used for Covid-19 patients in the state.Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope claimed on Sunday that no Covid-19 patient has died due to the shortage of medical oxygen in the state. He also said that the fatalities occurred due to the delay at patients' end in seeking medical assistance on time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/every-third-minute-1-person-dies-of-covid-19-in-maharashtra-101618801529800.html
19-04-2021||India||Are you more likely to get Covid-19? Diabetes, blood pressure are other conditions to be wary of||As the coronavirus pandemic continues to spread across India, the Centre on Monday shared a list of "risk factors" likely to increase Covid-19 vulnerability in an individual. The list was shared on the government's #IndiaFightsCorona Twitter account, aimed at keeping people well-informed about the crisis at hand. The Covid-19 risk factors, which include diabetes, old age, smoking, and certain cardiovascular and chronic respiratory diseases, are likely to make an individual more likely to contract the coronavirus disease.Here's the list of risk factors that could increase Covid-19 vulnerability:#IndiaFightsCorona:📍Risk factors increasing #COVID19 vulnerability✅Those with the age of 60 years and above ✅Those who smoke 🚬✅Those with non-communicable diseases (NCDs)#StaySafe👍 #Unite2FightCorona pic.twitter.com/SeU7bvVNLW1. Those with the age of 60 years and above: The Union ministry of health and family welfare, in its official guidelines on Covid-19, says that older people, specifically those above the age of 60 years, are more likely to contract the coronavirus disease and develop a serious illness. As per the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines, the risk for severe illness with Covid-19 increases with age, with older adults more likely to require hospitalisation if they get Covid-19, compared to younger adults. More than 80% of Covid-19 deaths occur in people over the age of 65, the CDC has warned. It's recommended that the health conditions of senior citizens are constantly monitored and urgent help is sought as soon as the need arises.2. Those who smoke: According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), smoking tobacco increases the risk factors associated with Covid-19. Although there is currently a dearth of enough well-designed peer-reviewed population-based studies to properly define the link between SARS-CoV-2 infection and smoking, a study by researchers from King’s College London in January showed that smokers are more likely to be hospitalised from Covid-19 and were more likely to have a higher symptom burden than non-smokers.3. Those with non-communicable diseases (NCDs): Certain NCDs in individuals increase Covid-19 vulnerability and make them more susceptible to contracting the coronavirus disease. These include:i) Cardiovascular disease - These include heart conditions such as heart failure, coronary artery disease, cardiomyopathies or hypertension. According to WHO, the aforementioned factors have been found to increase the odds for severe Covid-19 by 2.3, 2.9, and 3.9 times, respectively, in a meta-analysis. In another study, it was found that hypertension increased the risk of mortality from Covid-19 by 3.5 times, WHO said in its guidelines on Covid-19 and NCDs.ii) Chronic Respiratory Disease - These include chronic lung diseases, such as moderate to severe asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD), such as emphysema or chronic bronchitis, scarred lung tissue or interstitial lung disease (including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis), cystic fibrosis, and pulmonary hypertension (high blood pressure in the lungs). A study in the United Kingdom suggested that the presence of the aforementioned conditions increases patients' risk of severe complications or death from Covid-19, as per a WHO report.iii) Diabetes - The United Nations interagency task force on NCDs reported in a systematic review that people with diabetes were up to three times more likely to have severe symptoms or die of Covid-19, and the situation is worse for people with uncontrolled diabetes. The American Diabetes Association says that while there are not enough studies to show whether people with either type-1 or type-2 diabetes are more likely to get Covid-19 than the general population, it is evident that diabetic people are more likely to have worse complications once they get it and may have a higher chance of developing severe symptoms and complications.iv) Cancer - Cancer patients are more likely to experience severe Covid-19. A multicentre study conducted in China's Wuhan, and published in The Lancet medical journal, last year showed that the mortality rate from Covid-19 was significantly increased in patients with cancer and was particularly high among those with blood cancers. A new study in January earlier this year also found that patients with inactive cancer and not currently undergoing treatments for the deadly disease also face a significantly higher risk of severe illness from Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/are-you-more-likely-to-get-covid-19-govt-lists-coronavirus-risk-factors-101618796610490.html

I would like to reiterate that the safety of our students and their academic career are Education Ministry’s and my prime concerns right now,” he said.All students were advised to visit the official NTA website www.nta.ac.in and https://jeemain.nta.nic.in/ for latest updates related to the exams.The decision to defer the exam was taken in the wake of several requests from both candidates and parents.Earlier, concerns were raised about the effect of deferment of Class 12 CBSE and other state board exams on JEE (Main), JEE (Advance) and NEET exams.On Thursday, the Union health ministry postponed the NEET (PG) exams for admission to masters’ programmes in most private and government medical colleges. The exams were supposed to be held on Sunday.

Goa health minister profusely thanked his Kerala counterpart for the gesture on Sunday, when both the states registered the highest number of new Covid-19 infections and deaths.“I extend my gratitude to Smt. @shailajateacher Madam, Hon Health Minister of Kerala for helping us with movement of 20,000 litres of liquid oxygen for COVID patients in the state of Goa,” Goa health minister Vishwajit Rane tweeted, thanking Kerala health minister K K Shailaja, who is popularly known as Shailaja Teacher.Goa recorded 951 fresh cases of Covid-19 on Sunday, the highest since the pandemic outbreak, taking the active cases in the state to 7,052. It also recorded the highest single-day death toll with 11 Covid-19 patients succumbing, taking the cumulative death toll to 883, according to the daily Covid bulletin. Rane was grateful to the Kerala minister for the timely help.“The people of Goa are really grateful for your contribution to our fight against #COVID19,” Rane said.The gesture comes at a time when shortage of oxygen has become a major concern with the Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, asking for ramping up its production to meet the rising demand in hospitals among the worst-hit states including Kerala. The southernmost state of the country recorded the highest single-day surge on Sunday with 18,257 new Covid-19 cases and a test positivity rate (TPR) of 16.77%, according to the state health ministry. Kerala’s gesture to help out Goa is also noteworthy since several states including Goa have banned supply of oxygen to other states and diverted all oxygen manufactured internally for medical purposes within the state.“Supply of oxygen cylinders outside the state has been banned with immediate effect. All industrial oxygen requirements will be diverted towards the health services, GMC (Goa Medical College) & Covid hospitals. Necessary directions have been issued to secretary health to coordinate with the respective collectors to issue an order under the Disaster Management Act, 2005 in public interest and to save people’s lives,” Rane said on Friday.Rane also said the demand for oxygen had risen manifold and he had reached out to manufacturers within the state to help meet the demand.“With the increasing number of admissions at South Goa District Hospital (SGDH), oxygen consumption has also increased. Therefore, there is an urgent need for increased manufacturing of oxygen cylinders in the state of Goa. In view of the same, the government has requisitioned Oxynitro plant in Verna, Madgaon and Cuncolim which will help us in the seamless supply of oxygen to COVID Hospitals,” Rane said.Earlier Goa chief minister Pramod Sawant had claimed there was “sufficient availability of medical oxygen” and stated that the state infrastructure was “equipped to handle the demands” due to rising Covid 19 cases.The State government has also decided to add 500- beds for treatment of Covid patients at various facilities in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-is-severely-hit-by-covid-19-yet-helps-goa-with-20-000-litre-of-oxygen-101618800689793.html

The facility should have been functional with 250 beds on Sunday, but its opening was delayed by a day as military doctors posted there wanted some last-minute arrangements to be made, the officials said. No formal inauguration of the hospital is planned, they said. “Once patients are admitted, workers can’t get inside the facility. So, a decision was taken to get the work completed before opening the facility to patients,” said one of the officials cited above. He said all beds at the hospital have provision for giving oxygen to patients and there are enough ventilators in the hospital. “Patients will be treated free of cost. An RT-PCR Covid positive report and Aadhar card will be necessary for admission,” he said. Another 250 beds will be added to the Covid hospital by the weekend, said a second official. It will be functioning under a major general from the military’s medical wing.

The court said that the police’s endeavour to make an example of Sidhu for the entire sequence of events since he is a popular public figure hazards a failure of justice due to “compromised objectivity”.However, the Delhi Police arrested him again hours later, in connection with another case related to the violence during the rally.The second case was also registered at Kotwali police station, but on a complaint filed by the ASI. The first case was registered on the complaint of the Kotwali police station house officer in which the actor was arrested on February 9.Sidhu is the first person to be arrested in the second case, the police said.Advocate Abhishek Gupta, Sidhu’s counsel, said his client has been sent to judicial custody and the matter will be heard on Monday. He said that they will oppose the police remand and press for his immediate release, adding that he will also move a bail application if the remand plea is allowed.The Delhi Police arrested Sidhu on February 9 for his alleged involvement in the January 26 violence. The agency told the court that Sidhu was the “main instigator” and one of the rioters, a charge denied by him.A tractor rally organised by farmers protesting against the three contentious farm bills on Republic Day turned violent with farmers breaking police barricades and clashing with the personnel at several places.Hundreds of farmers also stormed Red Fort, damaged property and clashed with the policemen there.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rday-violence-actor-sidhu-in-custody-for-damage-to-red-fort-101618791287994.html

Of these, 34 persons tested positive, the release said.On Sunday, of the total number of 220 Kumbh returnees tested at the station, 15 were found infected.All of them were shifted to Covid Care facilities, it added.In order to stem the spread of the virus in the state, Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani had on Saturday announced that people returning to the state after attending the Kumbh Mela will have to undergo COVID-19 test before they are allowed to enter their respective cities and villages.He had said that collectors of all the districts in Gujarat were directed to keep a watch on the Kumbh Mela returnees and enforce a 'nakabandi' (security checking) to prevent their entry in their hometowns without undergoing test.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-two-days-49-kumbh-returnees-test-covid-19-positive-in-gujarat-101618791055704.html
19-04-2021||India||AAP flays BJP for ‘massive’ poll rallies in West Bengal, Assam||The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Sunday criticised the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), saying its top leaders are addressing large public gatherings and organising rallies in West Bengal, where assembly elections are underway, as well as during the assembly polls in Assam while the country is struggling with the second wave of Covid-19.The BJP, however, refuted the allegations and said the AAP should instead focus on saving Delhi from Covid-19.“Elections will be won and lost, political parties will come and go, but the lives of people will not. The BJP is putting more focus on election management and less on Covid management. While the people of India are concerned about how the Centre is managing Covid, and dealing with the surge in cases, the BJP is more concerned about their electioneering and how they can garner votes,” said AAP’s national spokesperson Raghav Chadha.“While on one hand, the pandemic has claimed thousands of lives and is infecting lakhs of people each day, on the other hand, in the assembly elections of West Bengal and Assam, the BJP, under the leadership of Home Minister Shri Amit Shah and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, is busy conducting gigantic rallies and roadshows that could be potential super spreader events with their massive crowds,” said Chadha, who is also the MLA of Delhi’s Rajendra Nagar constituency.He further said, “The rate at which people are contracting the virus is directly proportional to the speed at which these rallies conducted by the BJP are increasing.”“India has breached the 200,000-mark in Covid cases, while the BJP is focussing on conducting gigantic rallies in West Bengal. Winning elections and collecting votes is their sole motive, and the BJP has nothing to do with the people of India and their lives. In West Bengal, the BJP is promising a ‘double-engine sarkaar’, while not giving even a ‘single engine’ to Covid-19 management,” said the AAP spokesperson.BJP spokesperson Nalin Kohli said, “They (AAP) have no stake or presence in the elections (in West Bengal and Assam). Nor are they above the guidelines of the Election Commission. They would do well to do the job they are elected for — saving Delhi from Covid-19, instead of seeking media space to divert attention.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aap-flays-bjp-for-massive-poll-rallies-in-west-bengal-assam-101618790782443.html
19-04-2021||India||Future of migrant kids uncertain amid spike||Nitin Kumar’s eyes were full of despair as he waited along with his parents for a bus to Hardoi at Anand Vihar bus station on Friday afternoon to travel back to his hometown for the second time. Nitin left the city in June last year after the lockdown and returned again in October.“I was so happy to be back. I could not study in the village as the internet did not work properly; besides, all my friends are here. I do not want to go back and work in the fields there,” says 12-year-old Nitin, who lives goes to a government school.The fourth wave of Covid-19 in Delhi has costed Nitin’s father, Shyam Kumar, his job. “I have no work here. My child wants to study and stay in Delhi, but I have no choice,” says Kumar with tears in his eyes.With the sudden spurt in the number of viral infections and work drying up, Nitin is among the scores of children of migrant workers who are returning or being forced to return to their native village once again. Last year, scores of migrant workers and their families were spotted walking on the highways or hitching a ride in crammed trucks and buses to reach their hometown after a nationwide lockdown was imposed to curb the spread of Covid-19. Over the past few months, many of the children returned to the city with their parents while others remained in their villages.There has been limited assessment of the pandemic’s wider effects on the children of migrants. On Tuesday, the Supreme Court, in response to a petition filed by NGO Child Rights Trust, asked for data from all states and Union Territories on children of migrant workers. The petition said migrant children belong to three categories — children of migrant workers who stay behind in villages, children who are taken by the migrant workers to their place of work and children who migrate for labour of their own. “All these children have been the most vulnerable and the worst affected. Children of migrants and migrating children remain invisible... are denied access to health, proper nutrition, quality education and skills and knowledge they need to thrive and spend their lives in makeshift, unfriendly, unhygienic and testing conditions,” read the petition.Also read: Migrant workers treated as ‘outsiders’, says NHRC studySeema Kumar, general manager (programmes) of Smile Foundation, an NGO that works for the development of underprivileged children, said, “Children of migrants have gone through emotional upheaval and stress about a lot of things-- about their parents losing jobs, the fear of contracting the disease, about not being able to continue their studies among a host of other issues.”“We need to understand that for many of these children, school is also an opportunity to escape from the harsh realities of life in the slums. The closure of schools has had a severe emotional impact on them. Girls from the underprivileged section are particularly worried about not being able to continue their education.”She is not exaggerating. A policy brief released by the Right to Education Forum estimates around 10 million girls are at a risk of dropping out due to the impact of Covid-19.Rajni Mahto (14), a student of Class 10, said, “ We are two brothers and two sisters. My elder sister dropped out last year. I too may have to discontinue my studies if there is a lockdown.” In a slum cluster in Mayapuri, Koyal Kumari dreads that her mother, who works as a maid in Delhi, may soon be asked by her employers to take a break till the Covid-19 crisis is not brought under control and that may mean the end of her dreams of becoming a policewoman.Ismail Khan (12), who lives with his mother in Dilshad Garden, says the lockdown last year haunts him till this date as his father, who suffered from tuberculosis, died during that time. “ We did not have anything to eat, forget about having money to buy medicines for him. Another lockdown will mean we will have to struggle for food again,” he said.“In the past one year, many underprivileged children have seen the worst at a very young age–dropping out of schools to help support the family, their parents being harassed by landlords, struggling for two square meals, walking hundreds of kilometres with their parents to their villages. The worsening Covid-19 situation will only add to their woes,” said Sanjay Gupta, director of Chetna, an NGO working for poor children.“ A lot of migrants’ children, who had left Delhi, had come back in the past few months. We have taken several measures during the Covid crisis to ensure the welfare of children. We have set up Vidhan Sabha Monitoring Committees in all assembly constituencies to ensure and proper implementation of the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) and make sure every child has proper access to health and nutrition,” said Ranjana Prasad, a member of the Delhi Commission for Protection of Children Rights (DCPCR) . “Our school management committees at the district-level has been continuously working to keep a track of students who are missing from schools. It also reports cases of child labour and rescues children. We also have a child helpline, where children can seek help on any issues including health, education and food,” said Prasad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/future-of-migrant-kids-uncertain-amid-spike-101618787862704.html
19-04-2021||India||Migrant workers treated as ‘outsiders’, says NHRC study||National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) study on the social security and health rights of migrant workers says that this politically invisible section of the society doesn’t get access to even basic facilities and they are looked upon as outsiders or second class citizens in the host states.The human rights body’s study has come at a time when India is witnessing the second wave of Covid-19 infections and there are reports of migrant workers beginning to return home from their places of work.As part of the study, commissioned by NHRC and carried out by ‘Kerala Development Society’, the researchers interviewed around 4,400 migrant workers, local workers, employers/contractors, state government officials, elected representatives, scholars, experts, NGO representatives, trade unions members across four states/UTs, Delhi, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Haryana, all of which house a large number of workers from West Bengal, Assam, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Odisha, Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh.Most of the migrant workers who come to Delhi, Maharashtra, Gujarat and Haryana work in low income and high-risk sectors such as construction, heavy industry, transport, services, and agriculture, and have poor access to health services, social protection, education services, housing and sanitation, food, water and other utilities.Also read: Fearing 2020 rerun, migrants rush homeFor example, about 84% of the respondents in Delhi did not have proper accommodation or stayed in poor quality accommodation, according to the study. Inter-state migrants also don’t have access to good health care, except Delhi, where Mohalla (neighbourhood) clinics have been a help, the study added. Female migrant workers show a higher prevalence of nutritional deficiencies and have poor access to reproductive health services in comparison with local labourers, the study pointed out. As a result of intense and daily exposure to toxic air, a section of interstate migrant workers, especially female ones, suffer from asthma, cancer and reproductive health complications. “According to the field survey, 68 % of women covered by our survey do not have access to toilets as they live in slums or squatter settlements,” the study added. In Mumbai, about 62 % of migrant workers live in slums. The study claims that 43 interstate migrant workers die every month in Delhi, 35 in Gujarat, 41 in Haryana and 38 in Maharashtra due to accidents at construction sites, suicide, and stomach related diseases and heart ailments.It adds that the dead bodies of migrant workers are not sent by contractors/employers to their homes and are instead sold to some private medical colleges for about ₹2-3 lakh. HT could not immediately confirm this independently. However, no police complaint has yet been filed to this effect.The study said there is “no institutional mechanism either at national level or at state level to address different types of human rights violations against interstate migrant workers.” “In fact, migrant workers live in inhospitable cities and villages.” In September 2020, the central government announced that it will prepare a comprehensive database about all the migrant workers in the country; but work on it is yet to start. The database was supposed to be compiled by June 2021.About 92.5% of migrant workers in Delhi, 90.5% in Maharashtra, 87% in Gujarat and 86% in Haryana, according to the NHRC study, say the local population considers them outsiders and discriminates against them. And 57% of migrant workers in Delhi, 65% in Gujarat, 59% in Haryana and 69% in Maharashtra report that employers discriminate between interstate migrant workers and locals in the labour market in terms of wages and accommodation. “Lack of political representation in the home state or host state is an area of serious concern. In effect, they are often treated as second-class citizens in host states,” the NHRC study added. Jacob John, president of Kerala Development Society, said: “Interstate migrant workers never got policy attention.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/migrant-workers-treated-as-outsiders-says-nhrc-study-101618787510990.html
19-04-2021||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||Delhi recorded 24,375 new cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) on Saturday at a positivity rate of 24.56%. No Indian city has registered more; actually no city anywhere in the world has, at least to this columnist’s knowledge. Sure, Los Angeles saw 29,174 cases on December 26, in the worst phase of the US’s debilitating third wave of the viral pandemic, but that was because of Christmas (it recorded no cases on December 25). Delhi, some may argue, isn’t a city, but a city-state, and technically a Union Territory with a legislature. Still, it does have all characteristics of a large city — a predominantly urban population and 11 administrative districts that are tightly connected. It may be almost twice as large as New York, but it is marginally smaller than London. And right now, it is reeling under a fourth wave of Covid-19 — not just in terms of cases, but deaths too. On Saturday, it saw 167 deaths, the highest to date. Sunday’s numbers are not in when this column is being written.How bad is the city-state’s fourth wave? According to Jamie Mullick, the keeper of HT’s Covid-19 dashboard (from back in the time when the numbers were not so easily available), Delhi’s fourth wave is actually as bad as the city’s previous three waves combined (in terms of peak case levels). The seven-day average of cases on Saturday was higher than the highest seven-day averages witnessed during the previous three peaks — taken together (see the tables accompanying this piece).The numbers reflect that — in the seven days to Saturday, Delhi recorded 13.4% of the total (827,998) cases it has seen since the beginning of the pandemic.The seven-day average of deaths presents a healthier (I know, unfortunate choice of words) picture. It was 104 on Saturday, still lower than the peak seven-day average seen during the last wave.It makes little sense to dwell on what went wrong and how we got here. All the usual suspects — from complacence to apathy to misplaced priorities to a complete disregard for science and data — have been at play. But how do we get out of here?Hindustan Times (after the country’s first, bitter experience with a 68-day-long lockdown) has maintained that comprehensive lockdowns are avoidable except in two cases. One, the health infrastructure of a city or a region is under threat of being overwhelmed, or already is, and a further rise in cases would result in (I apologise for the choice of words in advance but this isn’t the time to sugar-coat things) people dying on the streets. Two, the city or region continues to see a huge increase in cases, with a high positivity level (a clear indicator that things could get worse). On Saturday, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said at a press briefing that the city-state faces a shortage of oxygen, drugs, and ICU beds. Also on Saturday, Delhi’s positivity rate touched 24.56% (which means one in four tests turned up positive). The seven-day average of the positivity rate (on Saturday) was 16.5% and rising fast. Delhi clearly needs a short sharp lockdown, one that includes curbs on inter-state movement of people (not goods) without good reason, perhaps even on trains and flights.Also read: CM issues appeal for beds as 1 in 3 samples in Delhi is positiveIt can be argued that there will be an economic cost to all this, just as the local government likely reasoned a few weeks ago — a time when it made sense to impose some not-so-drastic restrictions — that there would be an economic cost to these, but the alternative is unimaginable. Indeed, Delhi, and India’s management of the Covid-19 pandemic is a study in reactive management — we have always been a step behind the virus.Delhi also needs to aggressively vaccinate people. A little over two million people have received one dose of a vaccine and around 440,000, both doses. That’s around 12% of the city-state’s population (more than many other cities and regions) that has some form of protection against severe infection and death (there’s enough research to show that even one dose substantially enhances this protection). The question I would be asking, if I were in either the state or union government is simply this: how soon can we double this number? Because 25% protected against severe illness and death definitely sounds better.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-what-you-need-to-know-today-101618785260925.html
19-04-2021||India||A 3rd of all new infections reported from Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh||A third of all new cases of Covid-19 reported across India on Sunday came from just two states – Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh – both of which broke all previous single-day case records as the outbreak continued to soar in the country’s most populous regions.Sunday is also now the seventh day in a row that India has set a new record for the most new cases in a day, which has now pushed the total number of active cases in the country to nearly 2 million. As of Sunday night, there are 1,930,206 active Covid-19 cases across the country, according to HT’s Covid-19 dashboard.A total of 68,631 new infections were reported in Maharashtra on Sunday, while 30,566 new cases were recorded in UP, the highest and second highest in the country for the day, according to HT’s Covid-19 dashboard. Together, they accounted for 36% of the 275,482 new cases across India, also a nationwide record.Also read: India logs 275k new Covid-19 cases, positivity rate doublesOn Sunday, 17 states and Union territories across the country set new daily case records, a statistic that highlights the geographical spread of the second wave of India’s Covid-19 outbreak. Key among them were Delhi (25,462 cases on Sunday), Karnataka (19,067 new cases), Kerala (18,257 daily infections), Madhya Pradesh (12,248) cases, Tamil Nadu (10,723), Rajasthan (10,514) and Gujarat (10,340).The 10 worst affected states are Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, Chhattisgarh, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Kerala, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu and Rajasthan that have together reported 79% of the new infections recorded in the country on Sunday.The daily average of 218,935 cases registered over the last week is also a record, and is more than twice what was seen during the worst of the first wave in the country – the seven-day average of daily cases peaked at 93,617 for the week ending September 16, 2020. Just last week, this number was 133,918 – this means that the outbreak in the country is currently expanding by 63% every week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/a-3rd-of-all-new-infections-reported-from-maharashtra-uttar-pradesh-101618780868826.html
19-04-2021||India||Bengal has been a divided ground for long: Amartya Sen||Ahead of the fifth of eight phase assembly elections in West Bengal on Saturday, Nobel laureate Amartya Sen spoke to Sunetra Choudhury about the elections and the issues involved. Edited excerpts:Why are Bengal elections associated with violence? The fear of violence was also cited by the Election Commission (EC) for eight phase polls.I don’t think it is because Bengal is more violent. I think the EC wanted it divided and if you see how the election is going, where the Prime Minister goes away and does a little bit of work for his Prime Ministerial role and then comes back in time for another part of the elections. This is something in which the central government clearly has some ability to participate in every activity in a way that would not have been possible if it were a one-day election or a two-day election. Now, I don’t know whether that was the reason for EC doing it in this form. A lot of people in Bengal are rather critical of the Election Commission, the way the law and order situation has gone...Bengal is divided between Hindus and Muslims that has not been traditionally a big divider. On the contrary, if you go back to the beginning of Bengali culture and literature, in the 10th century, you will see an intermingling of Hindus and Muslims... The main epics, the Ramayana and Mahabharata, the main translating initiative came from the Muslim King in Bengal who was very fond of the epics. There has been a tradition of Hindu-Muslim unity from time to time...BJP no doubt uses polarisation, but election strategist Prashant Kishor has acknowledged that TMC and Congress only tried to appease Muslims and now Hindus wanted to vote for a party that was looking at their interests. Do you agree with this?It seems like an approximate history. Bengal has been a divided ground for a long time. When the British partitioned it early in the 20th century and wanted a Muslim part separated out, they hoped that there would be support from the Muslims in Bengal... Bengalis, both Hindus, and Muslims, were totally against it... Given that Muslims have been traditionally a lot poorer than Hindus in Bengal... there is a need for justice in dealing with it, in looking after the poor, in looking after those at the rougher end of the pyramid of justice... It is important to see who the poor in a region are and what can be done to help them. Now some of the concerns with Muslims came for the same reason as the concern for Matuas, Namasudra, and the Hindu lower caste or the Hindu-related tribal population of Bengal.So, I think the whole idea of Muslims having done it, and now it was the time for Hindus to teach them a lesson, is just a part of the propaganda of a party inspired by Hindutva thoughts...You spoke about the lower caste communities and the underprivileged, the BJP counts them as their voters. They also voted for them in Uttar Pradesh and in the 2019 general elections. What would explain that?That’s a very interesting question because what happens electorally is not just a matter of what preceding justice was in a particular area. It depends so much on the organisational facility.One of the interesting things to look at far away from Bengal or UP would be say Kerala. Kerala had more untouchability, more caste division than almost anywhere else in India. And yet, because of ultimate organisation, in this case by the Left, the caste situation changed radically over time. And it was possible for the Communist Party, which ignored these caste divisions, to get support from all the castes. We must not ignore the enormous role that political organisation plays. Hindutva has been a very dynamic political movement. I may not agree with them, but I certainly admire many of their organisational feats and they were successful not in all the elections...Do you think certain crucial mistakes were made by the state government?There may well have been, I haven’t studied it in particular. There are also achievements. The Bengali peasants still have a better health condition than the Gujarati peasants, despite being poorer. There are some delivery issues, but distribution has worked quite well and so on...||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-has-been-a-divided-ground-for-long-amartya-sen-101618779417117.html

19-04-2021||India||To encourage pilgrims, portals of Yamunotri shrine to open on May 14||This year the portals of the Yamunotri shrine will be opened on May 14 at about 12.15 pm. The decision on the date of opening the portals was taken by the Yamunotri Dham Mandir Samiti on Sunday on the occasion of Yamuna Jayanti. After checking the auspicious time from an astrological point of view, the exact time of 12.15 pm on May 14 was arrived at for opening the portals of the Yamunotri shrine for the next six months, Kriteshwar Uniyal, Secretary, Yamunotri Dham Mandir Samiti said. He informed that the portals of the Gangotri shrine will be opened on May 15 on the occasion of Akshay Tritya at around 7.30 am. In February this year, the date for opening the portals of Badrinath shrine- May 18 -was declared on the occasion of Basant Panchami. Last month the date of opening of the portals of Kedarnath shrine - May 17- was announced. The portals of the Sikh holy shrine Hemkund Sahib in Chamoli district will be opened this year on May 10. On October 10 last year, the portals of Hemkund Sahib were closed for the winter months following all rituals and prayers. The shrine was opened on September 4 last year following relaxations under Unlock 4.0. Last year Char Dham yatra didn’t start on April 26 with the opening of portals of Yamunotri and Gangotri (first two shrines to open after winter months) as lockdown had been imposed from March 22 due to the pandemic. The Char Dham shrines were opened for local pilgrims on July 1 last year by the state government and for pilgrims from other states in the last week of July. In September, the Uttarakhand government further removed the negative Covid-19 report mandatory for all pilgrims. According to Char Dham Devasthanam Management Board officials, last year, overall, 3.1 lakh pilgrims participated in the Char Dham Yatra, including 1.3 lakh pilgrims for Kedarnath. In 2019, over 32.40 lakh pilgrims had visited Char Dham shrines including over 10 lakh to Kedarnath, 12.4 lakh to Badrinath, 4.6 lakh to Yamunotri and over 5.3 lakh to Gangotri shrine Kedarnath, along with Badrinath, Yamunotri and Gangotri, collectively called Char Dham, attract lakhs of pilgrims each year. Traditionally, Char Dham pilgrimage begins from the west from Yamunotri, then proceeding to Gangotri and finally to Kedarnath and Badrinath in the east.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/to-encourage-pilgrims-portals-of-yamunotri-shrine-to-open-on-may-14-101618776988335.html

Addressing residents of MP, Chouhan said, “It is necessary to break the chain. But I will not impose lockdown in the state. I request people of my state to stay at home. They should go out only for the most important work.” “I request people to get tested immediately after getting any symptoms. The state government has developed 110 Covid-19 Care Centres to treat the patients with mild symptoms. We have also increased the number of beds to 40,484 and will increase them to 50,000 by April 30,” he added. “We are ready to provide government buildings to private partners and NGOs for developing Covid-19 hospitals. We are also making arrangement to improve the oxygen supply in MP. We will increase the supply of oxygen from 267 metric tonnes to 700 metric tonnes by April 30,” said the CM. He further added, “I request people to support the state government to contain the infection as the average number of daily positive cases has increased to 11,000.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mp-cm-shivraj-singh-chouhan-bats-for-janata-curfew-in-madhya-pradesh-amid-covid-19-spike-101618776088201.html

On Sunday, the positivity rate was 29.74%, with 161 deaths being reported in the last 24 hours.Fewer than 100 intensive care unit beds were available in the city of more than 20 million people, Kejriwal said, with widespread complaints about the lack of beds, oxygen cylinders and crucial drugs.“The bigger worry is that in last 24 hours positivity rate has increased to around 30% from 24% ... The cases are rising very rapidly. The beds are filling fast,” Kejriwal told a digital news briefing.The test positivity rate – a ratio of the number of positive cases to total tests conducted, and a measure of the scale of an outbreak in the region – shot up from 0.59% over a month ago, to 29.74% on Sunday.In a separate statement, the Delhi government said it informed the Centre about “the dire need of beds and oxygen” and beds were now being set up in schools.Kejriwal said Delhi was facing an “acute shortage” of oxygen for Covid-19 patients and added that the quota of the city was diverted to other states. The remarks came hours after he wrote the letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi.“Del facing acute shortage of oxygen. In view of sharply increasing cases, Del needs much more than normal supply. Rather than increasing supply, our normal supply has been sharply reduced and Delhi’s quota has been diverted to other states. OXYGEN HAS BECOME AN EMERGENCY IN DEL,” the chief minister tweeted on Sunday evening. He also wrote a letter to Union commerce and industries minister Piyush Goyal in this regard.The Union minister told ANI: “State governments should keep demand (for medical oxygen) under control. Demand-side management is as important as supply-side management. Containing Covid-19 spread is the responsibility of state governments and they should fulfil this responsibility.”Delhi, which has imposed a weekend curfew, is among the worst hit cities in India. The weekend curfew comes on top of 10pm-5am night curfew restrictions that are in place until April 30.Also Read | 8 states most prone to climate crisis: StudyChief minister Kejriwal and lieutenant governor Anil Baijal will hold a meeting with senior government officers on Monday over the Covid-19 situation in the national capital.Nationwide, India reported 275,482 new cases on Sunday, taking the total number of cases past 15 million, second only to the US, which has reported more than 31 million infections. The country’s deaths from Covid-19 rose by a 1,622 to reach a total of 178,814.At the briefing, Kejriwal said he urged Union home minister Amit Shah to increase the number of Covid-19 beds in central government hospitals and help with oxygen supply. “In the last 24 hours, Delhi recorded around 25,500 new cases, up from around 24,000 the previous day and 19,500 new cases the day before that,” he said.“Cases are increasing at a fast rate and Covid-19 beds are getting occupied across the city. People are getting admitted in hospitals at an unprecedented rate. There is a major crisis of ICU beds. There are less than 100 ICU beds left in Delhi. We are facing a major shortage of oxygen, too. Last night, a private hospital told us that they almost ran into a disaster situation with a major shortage of oxygen supply,” the CM added.“We are constantly in touch with the central government. We are getting a lot of help from them. We thank them for that. Yesterday (Saturday), I spoke with Union health minister Harsh Vardhan. He was informed about the situation. Today, I spoke to Union home minister Amit Shah over phone. I have told him that we need more beds. In Delhi, the central government hospitals collectively have around 10,000 beds, of which around 1,800 are currently reserved for Covid-19 patients. I have requested him (Shah) to reserve at least 7,000 beds for Covid-19. The situation in Delhi is deteriorating every second. I also requested that oxygen supply be provided to us immediately,” said Kejriwal.He added that the Delhi government will be adding more than 6,000 additional Covid-19 beds with oxygen facilities in two-three days in locations that include health facilities set up at Yamuna Sports Complex, CWG village and premises of Radha Soami Satsang Beas. “We don’t know how many ICU beds we will be able to increase in such a short time. There are limitations. But we have seen that most patients primarily need high-flow oxygen. So, we are arranging more high-flow oxygen systems so that more beds can be converted into oxygen beds,” he said.In his letter to the PM, Kejriwal wrote: “The Covid-19 situation in Delhi is extremely serious. There is a severe shortage of Covid-19 beds and oxygen supply. At our level we are doing everything that is possible. We need your help.”As per the Delhi health department, 25,462 Covid-19 cases and 161 deaths were reported in the last 24 hours, taking the total active cases in Delhi to 74,941. The total positive cases in the city now stand at 853,460,, including 766,398 recoveries and 12,121 deaths.As many as 85,620 samples were tested for the virus, including 56,015 RT-PCR/CBNAAT/TrueNath tests and 29,605 rapid antigen tests.In the last 24 hours, 67,448 beneficiaries were vaccinated against the coronavirus. Around 54,306 received the first dose, while 13,142 received the second dose.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cm-issues-appeal-for-beds-as-1-in-3-samples-in-delhi-is-positive-101618775005331.html

Yet, those two carriageways were unavailable for motorists since the police had blocked them.“Some days ago, we opened the NH24 carriageway towards Ghaziabad. Today, we are working to open the adjacent carriageway on NH9,” said Kumar.The officer denied speculation in certain quarters that the police were suddenly working to get the agitating farmers evicted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nh9-lane-towards-meerut-to-be-opened-at-ghazipur-border-for-ambulances-101618772968615.html
19-04-2021||India||3 held for hoarding remdesivir||Bengaluru Bengaluru police on Sunday arrested at least three persons for allegedly hoarding and black marketing Remdesivir, a drug commonly used to treat Covid-19 infected persons in hospitals. “The CCB (central crime branch) conducted a drive across Bengaluru and arrested the three accused who were having illegal stock of the injection and were selling them at ₹10,500 each, which is much higher than the MRP,” Sandeep Patil, joint commissioner of police (crime), said in a statement. A total of 11 vials of injections were seized during the raid. According to medical practitioners, the anti-viral injection that costs between ₹1,000 and ₹5,500, depending on the brand, is sold for ₹30,000 to ₹40,000 in the black market, Hindustan Times had earlier reported.Rajesh and Shakeeb, who run Gurushree medicals, a small medical store around Suddaguntepalya, were held in one such raid and Sohail was arrested from near Madiwala police station limits, police said. A probe is underway to find out the source of procurement.The arrests come at a time when hospitals in the city are already facing shortage of the drug.On Saturday, one person who did not wish to be named said he struggled to find the medicine for his infected mother in Banashankari locality of Bengaluru. “Even doctors are selling Remdesivir at exorbitant prices,” he claimed. The person added there was little response on the government-provided helpline number to procure Remdesivir.Representatives of one government and one private hospital told Hindustan Times that the drug was only being administered to in-patients and no other requests were being entertained keeping in mind its low availability.The Karnataka health department, however, said there was enough availability of the drug in Bengaluru and that hospitals are required to raise the request with an officer, specifically assigned for this purpose, to obtain the same. On Friday, the Karnataka government said it had placed orders for 70,000 doses of Remdesivir.“There is no shortage of the drug. However, the hospital has to raise the request for its supply with the concerned officer named for the purpose,” an official in the state health department said, requesting not to be named.Since the beginning of March, the city has witnessed a massive surge in Covid-19 cases, with more persons requiring hospitalization and critical life-saving drugs like Remdesivir.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/3-held-for-hoarding-remdesivir-101618772788046.html
19-04-2021||India||Executives play key role in fight against Covid||Bengaluru In the past one year, 23-year-old Shilpa has barely missed a day of work. Working in various shifts at Bangalore Electricity Supply Company Limited or BESCOM, she is among the over 100 people who are busy attending calls on the Covid-19 helpline from all corners of the city as well as districts to respond to queries ranging from availability of hospital beds to the treatment process. “Earlier, we took calls on electricity-related issues but then we started taking calls on Covid-19. It felt a little different but we got enough training and assistance. We have received all the support we needed and there is not much stress on us,” Shilpa says.“In the last one year, there was a lot of fear and people cried when they couldn’t get beds. Now, the situation has changed,” she adds. The call centre in the city receives nearly 1,000 calls per day and each representative attends to around 80-90 of them in their respective shifts, including checking on people to see if their needs were fulfilled. The staff got their first breather from Covid-related calls sometime in January when the caseload was reduced and the personnel were reassigned back to their original roles, that is, attending to electricity-related queries. “There is no stress per say because we are after all helping others with information when they need it the most,” 27-year-old Anil Kumar, an executive, says. In return for their services, these executives were picked and dropped back to their homes in sanitized company cabs to minimize their exposure to the coronavirus which has reigned havoc in the IT capital and other parts of the state and country. These faceless executives, like several others, have played a critical role in the fight against the pandemic, coordinating between hospitals, patients and their loved ones. Police, civic workers, ambulance drivers, health workers among several other sections have been the workhorses of the entire operation in Bengaluru and other parts of the country, quietly carrying out their roles behind all the clamour, chaos and cameras, experts believe.Several such workers have also paid with their lives, religiously carrying out their duties but getting minimum attention unlike frontline warriors like doctors, nurses among others. The case rise has not been kind to the people or those fighting it. More so, in the second wave which began in the first week of March. Bengaluru, in particular, has seen a sharp surge in cases since the beginning of March which has more than doubled since April. The city has reported over one lakh more infections in just the first 18 days of April as against 31,886 in March, 6,813 in February and 10,311 in January, according to data from the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP, the city’s civic body). In the wake of the spike, the call centers have witnessed increased traffic in recent days, people aware of the developments said. Gopal, the person in charge of the call centre, said that though there are several people who may not require hospitalisation, contracting the infection causes panic among them. This is when the executives try to calm the caller, coordinate with in-house doctors and check if hospitalisation is required. “This covid helpline was set up here because this is a time-tested system where we used to at times get 25,000 calls per day, mostly regarding electricity-related complaints,” Rajesh Gowda, the managing director of BESCOM, says.The MD also said that they have added around 30 dedicated lines and more personnel due to the rising call traffic.To ensure services for all, the centre has also opened its helpline on WhatsApp which is tended to by trained professionals, medical students and even the police personnel to coordinate all related issues. Bengaluru has nearly run out of hospital beds, especially in the intensive care units (ICU) and those with ventilators. But the situation on the ground has little effect on those attending to calls who have remained as focused on the job at hand. “It feels really good when they say thank you at the end of the call. That’s all we need to continue,” Shilpa says.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/executives-play-key-role-in-fight-against-covid-101618772728039.html
19-04-2021||India||127 million Covishield doses and 17 million Covaxin sent by centre so far||India has about 13 million Covid-19 vaccine doses in possession of the states — about 7.8 million Covishield and 5.7 million Covaxin – with about 10 million more in the pipeline for distribution among states over the coming weeks, data reviewed by HT showed on Sunday.Of a total of about 144 million doses that the Centre supplied to all states and Union territories till April 18, nearly 127 million were Covishield doses and 17 million doses were of the Covaxin vaccine, according to government data accessed by HT till late on Sunday.Amid allegations by states that vaccines are in short supply, the Centre maintains there is no shortage in the country. “The manufacturers are producing to their optimum capacity and supplying to the government. They are also simultaneously ramping up their capacities which will be visible by June,” said a central government official aware of the matter, adding there was no supply crunch from the manufacturers’ side.India is currently administering two vaccines – Covishield and Covaxin – after a nationwide immunization drive against the infectious disease began on January 16. The drugs controller general of India (DCGI) last week approved the Covid-19 vaccine developed by Russia’s Gamaleya Research Institute, Sputnik V, for emergency use in India, a day after the regulator’s subject expert committee (SEC) recommended that there was enough data to grant the vaccine emergency use authorisation. The first local supplies of the Russian vaccine are expected by July.Covishied is an Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine locally manufactured by the Serum Institute of India (SII), and Covaxin is co-developed by Bharat Biotech International Ltd. and the Indian Council of Medical Research.Out of 144 million doses supplied so far to states, a total of 123 million doses have been consumed since the nationwide Covid-19 vaccination was launched. Of these, Covishield doses are about 110 million and about 11 million are Covaxin doses, government data shows.“The companies have fixed capacities, and like I said, they are producing 100% for the government, so there are no supply issues,” the official quoted above said on condition of anonymity.Also Read | -ve RT-PCR test must for those coming from 6 states: Maharashtra govtAnother government official who spoke on condition of anonymity said: “Supplies are not an issue; the government focus is to ensure maximum eligible beneficiaries are vaccinated at the earliest.”The Union ministry of health and family welfare also wrote to states on Sunday asking to ensure movement restrictions imposed by the government for Covid-19 control do not adversely impact the vaccination exercise.“It is advised that Covid-19 vaccination services should not be affected by Covid-19 curfews/lockdowns, and the movement of beneficiaries to and from Covid-19 vaccination centres should not be restricted during such interventions…,” said Manohar Agnani, additional secretary, health ministry, in his letter to states.Experts said with the rapid rise in cases, vaccination will be one of the key interventions to bring down the numbers in the long run.“We don’t have enough evidence to support whether these vaccines are effective in stopping transmission; however, we do know that these stop disease progression to severe level. If we keep on having milder version of infection for some time, then over a period of time it may just die, which is why vaccination is important,” said Dr K Srinath Reddy, founder, Public Health Foundation of India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/13mn-vaccine-doses-with-states-another-10mn-in-pipeline-data-101618772487420.html
19-04-2021||India||Fearing 2020 rerun, migrants rush home||Hariharan Yadav (34) is one of the several migrant workers who returned from Maharashtra’s Nagpur city to his village in Uttar Pradesh’s Gorakhpur, fearing the Covid-19 situation may turn from bad to worse and that he may lose his job amid a possible lockdown like last year.Unwilling to go through the same set of troubles and pain he experienced last year, Yadav, who is a painter, said: “The pain and torture to which we were subjected during the lockdown last year is still fresh in my memory. I travelled for more than 200km on foot, faced police detention and almost died due to hunger. Hence, this year, I cannot take any chances as I have a family to look after.”Besides Yadav, more than 200 villagers, who were involved in similar professions in Maharashtra, have returned till date to Rampur Rakba, which is referred to as the painter’s village. “Around 800 villagers work in different states as painters and half of them have returned,” Jai Prakash Paswan, former village head of Rampur Rakba, East UP, said.Ravindra Pal Singh (38), a resident of Basti district, boarded a train home from New Delhi railway station last week. “I worked at a food processing plant in Bahadurgarh, Haryana. There was very little work, so I decided to return home and help my family in the fields. If the Covid-19 cases go down, I will go back,” he said.Similarly, 50-year-old Nripendra Kumar, who has been living in Mumbai for over two decades, returned to his native village Jaffarpur in Purnea district of Bihar on Friday. “I lost my job and there was nothing left for me,” Kumar said, adding that a large number of people from Bihar were leaving Mumbai and other cities of Maharashtra, where daily Covid-19 cases have crossed 60,000.Also read: A 3rd of all new infections reported from Maharashtra, Uttar PradeshIn Muzaffarpur, one of the districts that has a high migrant population in various states, reverse migration has started.

So, I decided to board the special train,” he said.In Madhya Pradesh’s Bundelkhand, Alirajpur and Jabhua, close to 20,000 workers returned from the National Capital Region (NCR), Maharashtra and Gujarat in the past week with some of them losing their jobs amid the second wave.While several state governments have decided to test migrant workers, they are yet to open quarantine centres and deploy rural health infrastructure personnel to track the returnees.

19-04-2021||India||‘I was hounded for no fault of mine’: Ex-ISRO scientist||For him, it is not a sweet revenge but a long drawn-battle for justice and truth. Sitting on the verandah of his house in Palkulangara in the heart of the state capital, former scientist of the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) Nambi Narayanan is not elated over the media crowd around him yet again. On Thursday, the Supreme Court had ordered a probe led by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) into the wrongful arrest of the 80-year-old in an espionage case 27 years ago that blew up his career and reportedly delayed the country’s cryogenic rocket engine programme. “Let the truth come out. I was hounded for no fault of mine. The country’s rocket programme suffered badly. Who plotted the entire drama? Let the conspiracy come out,” he said, adding on a lighter note that most of the media men in the capital knew more about the case than him. But as he got into details, indignation and anger writ large on his bearded face. He remembered the day three policemen descended on his house on November 30, 1994, with a request that their boss, a deputy inspector general of police (DIG), wanted to talk to him. He followed them in their jeep quietly.At the police station, he was asked to sit on a bench. The DIG did not turn up and he fell asleep on that bench that night. On the following morning, he was informed that he was arrested for espionage among other charges. It was the beginning of a long ordeal for Narayanan. (Then) DIG Sibi Mathews, who later became the state police chief, is one of the three police officers facing the CBI probe now. Narayanan was in judicial custody for 51 days and allegedly tortured by police officials and later by the sleuths of the Intelligence Bureau (IB). He was forced to stand for long hours without food or water and was even put through a lie detection test. “I told them bluntly that rocket technology cannot be transferred on a piece of paper. But junior level officers and others kept asking me how I sold secrets. They were eager to frame me. They had no idea about either cryogenic technology or the space programme and they treated me like any other criminal in their custody,” he recalled. When the espionage case came to light, Narayanan, who was 55 years then, was in charge of the cryogenic division of ISRO. He was the first to introduce liquid prolusion fuel technology. The country’s space technology suffered badly due to the case. “The technology should have been in use by 1999 but it was delayed for 15 years and finally came in 2014,” he said. Lodged in the high-security Poojapura central jail, one of the former ISRO scientist’s cell mate was a serial killer. “They were all kind to me and consoled me saying I was framed for some other motive,” he said. When Narayanan was taken to the court, people mocked him. He was also hounded by the media. The case was later handed over to the CBI and he got bail on January 19, 1995. The ordeal was far from over. When he returned home, he found his wife Meenakshi Amma had slipped into depression and his two children were also disturbed. “Everything turned upside down for me. Hated by all, I thought of committing suicide on several occasions. But I never wanted to die as a traitor. I lived all these years only to tell my bitter story,” he said. The sensational case, which later became a plot for several books and movies, surfaced in 1994 when during a beat patrol, two policemen found two Maldivian semi-literate women Mariyam Rasheeda and Fouzia Hassan staying in one of the rented houses in the state capital despite visa expiry. A diary was seized from them which reportedly carried several names, including two senior ISRO scientists -- Nambi Narayanan and D Sasikumaran. Narayanan, Sasikumaran, a contractor and the two women were charged with offences such as espionage, cheating and hatching conspiracy under various sections, including the Official Secrets Act. They were accused of selling the country’s top rocket secrets to an enemy country for sexual favours and money. Later, the inspector general of police (IG) Ramon Srivastav’s name cropped up in the case.The case also witnessed a political fallout. Then chief minister K Karunakaran was forced to quit in 1995 when a section of party men led by Congress leaders A K Antony and Oommen Chandy revolted and accused him of protecting Ramon Srivastav. Later, Antony flew down in a chartered flight from Delhi to become the chief minister. Two powerful groups soon emerged in the state Congress and Karunakaran used all his opportunities to corner his rivals in the party. “My father was hounded badly, citing trumped up charges. More than his opponents, some in the party did more damage to him. He did not get justice. It remained an unhealed wound till his last breath,” K Karunakaran’s son K Muraleedharan said, while welcoming the latest CBI probe into the case. Srivastav also lauded the order for the CBI inquiry. It is a different story though that the CPI(M) had held a series of agitations against him at the height of the spy scandal. Srivastava, who is now settled in Kerala, is one of the top advisors of present chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan.Narayanan got relief when the CBI took over the case and exonerated him finally in 1996. The state government moved the Supreme Court with an appeal that was dismissed in 1998. “Though I was exonerated and taken back into service, the stigma still remained. For the next two decades, I fought many legal battles for my honour and I wanted to make sure it did not happen with any other official in the country,” he said. The latest CBI probe came after he moved the apex court challenging the High Court order absolving three senior police officers (former DGP Sibi Mathew, former SPs K K Joshua and S Vijayan) in the case. But all the three retired officers later claimed that the Jain Commission never heard them before recommending the CBI probe. The state government was forced to loosen its wallet and pay a compensation of ₹1.80 crore to Narayanan in three installments. And the country bestowed him the third highest civilian honour Padma Bushan in 2019. “My age is really weighing on me. Thank God, the SC has set a three-month time frame for the CBI inquiry. I hope I can see the end result of who cooked up the case,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/i-was-hounded-for-no-fault-of-mine-ex-isro-scientist-101618772308100.html
19-04-2021||India||Mamata slams govt over vaccine supply||West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Sunday wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi that the state was running out of Covid-19 vaccines and essential medicines such as Remdesivir, while cases were on the rise.In the letter, Banerjee also took a veiled dig at the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), saying people coming from other states for election campaigning “at the behest of some political parties” were responsible for the sharp rise in infections.Citing her February 24 letter in which she sought the Centre’s permission to directly purchase vaccines and start a free vaccination campaign across Bengal, Banerjee wrote, “The state has not received the requisite clearance yet. In the meantime, the number of cases in the state has also started to rise sharply, particularly in view of coming of large number of outsiders to the state for election campaign and other purposes at the behest of some political parties.”Stating that vaccination is of “top importance,” especially in Kolkata, where concentration of population is very high, Banerjee wrote, “Unfortunately for us, the supply of vaccines from the Government of India side is scarce and erratic, which has been negatively affecting our vaccination programmes…We have to vaccinate around 2.7 crore and we need 5.4 crore doses. We request for your urgent intervention to ensure that the state gets its requirement of vaccine doses fulfilled at the earliest.” “Instead of blaming the Prime Minister for the Covid crisis, the chief minister should have attended the meetings of chief ministers that the Centre convened,” Bengal BJP vice-president Jay Prakash Majumdar told HT||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mamata-slams-centre-over-vaccine-supply-101618771887419.html

All consumers of such vaccines could be duly cautioned that these vaccines are being allowed for use based on the approval granted by the relevant authority abroad,” he said.To be sure, coronavirus vaccines cleared for use in the US, the UK, the European Union, and Japan will get fast-track approval in India, the Union government said on Tuesday last week, potentially boosting the country’s pandemic response through possible imports of Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson (J&J) products.Acknowledging the huge potential in the private sector, Singh recommended that the government actively support domestic vaccine producers to expand their manufacturing facilities by providing them with funds and other concessions.“I believe this is the time to invoke the compulsory licensing provisions in the law so that a number of companies are able to produce the vaccines under a licence,” he said.The former prime minister also acknowledged the cloud of uncertainty among the people of the country who are “wondering when their lives would go back to normal”.On Sunday morning, the Union ministry of health and family welfare announced that more than 122 million people in India were vaccinated against Covid-19 in a span of 92 days. It added that in the last 24 hours, over 2.6 million people were inoculated in the country, pushing the overall figure to 122,622,590.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vaccines-key-to-tackling-covid-manmohan-singh-to-pm-modi-101618771828909.html
19-04-2021||India||Bihar, Tamil Nadu govts impose night curfews to contain spread||The governments of Bihar and Tamil Nadu on Sunday clamped a curfew on the movement and assembly of people at night, as part of their efforts to arrest the surging coronavirus infections that threaten to overrun the health infrastructure in the states amid India’s worst outbreak.Over the last 24 hours, Bihar recorded 8,690 cases and 27 deaths. The total caseload is 324, 117. Tamil Nadu, meanwhile, recorded an all-time high in daily cases with 10,723 fresh cases and 42 deaths. The state’s total caseload stands at 991,451.Announcing the restrictions, Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar urged migrant labourers from the state to return as soon as possible. “The difficulty will increase with delay,” he said.Migrants have been making their way back to Bihar as the coronavirus figures started surging. Over the last week, thousands have reached the state from Mumbai, Pune and Delhi.All malls, parks, cinema halls across the state have been closed and restaurants have been kept open only for takeaways. Educational institutions and religious establishments will be closed till May 15, the CM said, adding that no exams will be conducted.In Tamil Nadu, the night curfew will come into effect from 10 pm to 4 am starting April 20. Sunday curfew will be implemented from next Sunday.According to a statement issued by the state government, no public or private transport will be allowed during night curfew. Intrastate and interstate public and private transport too will not be operated. “Not over 100 people will be allowed in weddings and for funerals, the number stands at 50. Only 50 per cent employees allowed to work in IT firm offices. Others should be given work from home,” the statement said.The new restrictions are in place until further orders. Class 12 Board exams for the state board students have been postponed but practical exams, which got underway on Friday, will continue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bihar-tn-govts-impose-night-curfews-to-contain-spread-101618771707475.html
19-04-2021||India||PM reviews Covid-19 situation in Varanasi||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday reviewed the Covid-19 situation in his Lok Sabha seat Varanasi while asking the administration to provide all assistance to people.In view of the increasing number of Covid-19 cases in the second wave of the pandemic, the Prime Minister laid emphasis on the need to increase efforts at every level.During his review via video conferencing, Modi sought information from the Varanasi administration about testing, beds, medicines, vaccines, availability of oxygen and manpower deployed to treat Covid-19 patients, as well as the steps being taken to prevent the spread of Covid-19.Stressing on the importance of the vaccination drive, he asked the Varanasi administration to make all people above 45 years of age aware about it. Expressing his gratitude to all doctors and medical staff of the country, Modi said even in this hour of crisis, they were performing their duties faithfully.Emphasising on the ‘test, track and treat’ strategy, the PM said that like the first wave, the same strategy has to be adopted to win against the virus in the second wave. “Learning from the experiences of the past year, we have to move forward cautiously,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-reviews-covid-19-situation-in-varanasi-101618771647371.html
19-04-2021||India||BJP, Maharashtra govt spar over Remdesivir supply||A row between the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the ruling alliance in Maharashtra intensified on Sunday, with the BJP calling for an FIR over allegations that the Centre was blocking the supply of Remdesivir medicine to the state.Maharashtra home minister Dilip Walse Patil on Sunday accused the BJP of trying to pressurise the Mumbai Police and interfere in their work. He said the city police received a specific input that 50,000 vials of Remdesivir were being brought to the city, and added that the director of Bruck Pharma was called for questioning on Saturday in that connection.Vile Parle police summoned a director of Bruck Pharma, a Daman-based pharmaceutical manufacturer of Remdesivir for questioning about a stock of the drug. The executive was questioned at the police station for more than 45 minutes and was let go later.Opposition leader Devendra Fadnavis said that the detention of the executive of Bruck Pharma, who was supposed to supply Remdesivir to Maharashtra, was a shameful act. “We visited the police station and DCP office to ask what was his offence. He had taken all permissions from Maharashtra and Daman administration…,” he said.Mumbai police are likely to call the director of the pharma company for one more round of questioning for allegedly stocking thousands of Remdesivir medicine vials, an official told PTI on Sunday.Fadnavis visited the police station on Saturday night along with other BJP leaders. The leader enquired why the director of the pharmaceutical company was called to the police station, he said in the statement.Fadnavis said that permission was taken from the FDA commissioner to donate the stock of Remdesevir vials to the Maharashtra government, as Remdesevir stocked for export cannot be diverted to the domestic market without the nod of the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) or the FDA.Patil said: “A probe is on whether the stock was to be sold to private parties or to the government. The stock is at present with the company. It was not going to the government… Investigation is being carried out to find out to whom it was being given.”Maharashtra Congress president Nana Patole, meanwhile, demanded action against Fadnavis and other leaders for “pressuring police to let off” the pharma company director.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-maha-govt-spar-over-remdesivir-supply-101618771588168.html
19-04-2021||India||Govt bans oxygen supply to industries||The Centre on Sunday decided to prohibit the supply of oxygen for industrial purposes by manufacturers and suppliers from April 22 barring nine select sectors, with massive shortage of medical oxygen across the country leading to more Covid-related casualties, according to a statement issued by the ministry of home affairs.The nine industrial sectors which will continue to get oxygen supply include pharmaceuticals, petroleum refineries, steel plants, ampoules and vials, nuclear energy establishments, oxygen cylinder manufacturers, waste water treatment plants, food and water purification and process industries which require uninterrupted running of furnaces. All other industrial units have been told to consider alternative measures such as import of oxygen or setting up Air Separator Units (ASUs) for generation of oxygen for their captive requirements.Home secretary Ajay Kumar Bhalla wrote to all states and Union territories informing them about diverting oxygen meant for industrial use for medical reasons after a review was done on Sunday by the Empowered Group-II mandated to coordinate medical logistics. Bhalla said states that have seen a rapid rise in Covid-19 cases and need medical oxygen include Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Haryana, Punjab, and Rajasthan.“The country has been facing an unprecedented surge in the new daily cases of Covid in various States and UTs... The requirement for Medical Oxygen is a critical component in the treatment of Covid affected patients. In view of the recent surge... the requirement of oxygen for effective clinical treatment... has also witnessed a manifold hike,” according to the MHA statement. “Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade has conveyed that this has already reached about 60 percent of the total daily Oxygen production, and is expected to rise further. There have been reports of shortage of medical oxygen from some States and UTs,” it added.After the Sunday order was issued, Union minister Piyush Goyal said that the measure has been taken to ensure adequate supply of oxygen to hospitals.“Before Covid pandemic hit India, our daily medical oxygen consumption was around 1,000-1,200 metric tonnes. But on April 15, 4,795 metric tonnes of medical oxygen was used in the country. We’ve increased production capacity in the last one year,” Goyal said, according to news agency ANI.The minister also gave a break-up of the shares that will be allotted to states which face a shortage. “After an elaborate meeting with 12 states, the central government did mapping ... 6,177 metric tonnes of oxygen has been finalised to be distributed to states...” the Union minister said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-bans-oxygen-supply-to-industries-amid-massive-shortage-101618771528051.html
19-04-2021||India||Kin allege 12 died in MP due to ‘oxygen shortage’, govt and hospital dismiss claim||At least 12 Covid-19 patients died due to alleged shortage of oxygen in a medical college in Shahdol on the intervening night of Saturday and Sunday, the families of the deceased said, even as Madhya Pradesh medical education minister Vishwas Sarang asserted that no deaths took place for lack of supply.“My brother was fine at 9pm on Saturday. The doctors told me that they were giving oxygen to him and he will be fine. But at 4am on Sunday, people began shouting that there was a shortage of oxygen. The patients were not getting oxygen. The family members tried to enter the ward but the hospital staff stopped us,” Prem Kevrani, whose 31-year-old brother succumbed to the infection, said on Sunday.“Later, I entered the ward and checked my brother. His body had turned cold and there were 11 others who died in the ward. The hospital staff said they died as they did not get proper oxygen,” he added.Sarang, however, said there was no shortage of oxygen and that a probe was ordered. “The serious patients died due to medical complications but an inquiry has been ordered in the matter to know the cause of the death of so many patients in one night.”Shahdol medical college dean Dr Milind Shilarkar said: “An oxygen tanker was scheduled to reach Shahdol on Saturday but it didn’t reach the medical college due to some mechanical issue... But, we were providing oxygen through small cylinders. The patients were admitted in a serious condition and they died due to health complications.”Attacking the government, MP Congress chief Kamal Nath said: “CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan is lying about oxygen supply by giving fake data. When will this end?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kin-allege-12-died-in-mp-due-to-o2-shortage-govt-and-hospital-dismiss-claim-101618771527430.html
19-04-2021||India||No lockdown for now, Bihar to contain Covid-19 spread through night curfew||Bihar will not go in for lockdown but will impose night curfew from 9 pm to 5 am and close all government and private educational institutions and postpone exams till May 15, to break the chain of transmission of the Covid-19 pandemic. The state has witnessed an unprecedented spurt in the last one month with the addition of 8690 new cases in the last 24 hours. This has taken the tally of active cases closer to 50,000 in Bihar. Announcing the move after marathon meetings with district magistrates and later with the crisis management group during the day, Chief Minister Nitish Kumar said Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) will be imposed as per requirement in town areas and block level during the day to prohibit assemblies of four or more individuals and avoid any crowding. “The district magistrates will ensure that vegetable mandis and roadside vending are staggered and not crowded. All public places like malls, cinema halls, gyms and parks as well as religious places will remain closed and restaurants and dhabas will only provide home delivery or takeaway facility. There will be a cap of 100 people for marriage and ‘shradh’ events. The government and private offices, already running with one-third attendance, will close by 5 pm, while the shops will close by 6 pm. Earlier, it was 7 pm. However, it will not apply to essential services,” he added. The announcement was very much on expected lines after Saturday’s all-party meeting, which was not unanimous on complete state-wide lockdown due to likely hardships faced by the common masses in a poor state like Bihar and the issue of large number of migrants. The CM, however, appealed to all the people living outside the state to return as early as possible, as delay will cause problems for them, hinting that the government might review the situation in the days to come to decide on sterner measures. “The government will make all arrangements. Those in home isolation will be monitored on a daily basis, while those returning will be provided with quarantine facilities like last year at the sub-divisional level. A lot of deliberations have been done on every aspect,” the CM said, adding that it had been decided to wait for some time before deciding on the possibility of lockdown. Kumar said that the government has also taken a decision to develop containment zones like last year to contain the spread of pandemic and increase number of beds in dedicated Covid hospitals and care centres and give a boost to awareness campaigns to make people aware of the need to adopt Covid-appropriate behaviour for their own safety as well as that of their near and dear ones. The CM said that during the meeting, all the aspects were discussed, viz. reports of oxygen shortage, medicine requirement, especially Remdesivir, and delay in RT-PCR reports. “The emphasis will be on fast tracking testing and vaccination. Early start of treatment is important and for that timely availability of RT-PCR reports will be ensured,” he added. The CM said that like last year, the panchayati raj department will start supply of masks in the rural and urban areas in larger numbers. “Like last year, the government has also decided to give one-month additional salary to doctors and health workers in view of the enormous work they are doing to meet the huge pandemic challenge,” he added. Health minister Mangal Pandey said that the government was ensuring smooth supply of oxygen and Remdesivir injection as also other medicines. “We are in touch with the suppliers and smooth supply will be ensured,” he added. After getting detailed feedback from all the political parties on the prevailing Covid-19 situation in Bihar at a meeting called by Governor Phagu Chauhan on Saturday, the CM had said that the government would announce further measures to contain the spread of the virus on Sunday after seeking reports from all the district magistrates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-lockdown-for-now-bihar-to-contain-covid-19-spread-through-night-curfew-101618771408023.html
19-04-2021||India||India logs 275k new Covid-19 cases, positivity rate doubles||India’s Covid-19 test positivity rate – a key indicator of the on-the-ground spread of the disease – has soared to the highest ever and has now doubled in less than two weeks, even as the country yet again set new single-day records with more than 275,000 new cases and 1,622 new deaths on Sunday, amid reports of shortages of crucial drugs and oxygen as the second wave continued its relentless expansion.A total of 275,482 new infections were lodged on Sunday, taking the total number of confirmed cases past the 15 million mark, even as daily deaths touched a record 1,622, according to HT’s Covid-19 dashboard.India’s testing positivity rate (TPR) – the proportion of samples returning positive for Covid-19 – touched 16.7% on Saturday, as the weekly average touched 14.3%, both the highest ever and are the latest in a series of grim milestones that the second wave of the outbreak is leaving in its wake. The previous record for highest daily positivity rate was lodged on July 19, 2020, when it touched 15.7%, and the old record for weekly positivity rate was 12.5% for the week ending July 15.A positivity rate of 16.7% means that one out of every six samples being tested returned positive, a very high proportion for a country the size of India. And this number is even higher when looked at certain states and UTs. In Chhattisgarh, Delhi and Goa, for instance, one out of every three tests was positive, and in Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu, one in every four was positive.“Chhattisgarh reported the highest weekly positivity rate among states at 30.4%... India’s daily new cases continue to rise… Sixteen states are displaying an upward trajectory in daily new cases,” said Union health ministry in a statement.Experts say that it is crucial that the chain of transmission be broken. “The most important thing at the moment is that transmission chain has to be broken... Also, extra measures need to be taken to curb super-spreader events,” said Dr K Srinath Reddy, senior public health expert, founder, Public Health Foundation of India.The rising cases have also led to increased demand for beds, medical oxygen, and the antiviral drug Remdesivir, with people finding it hard to get any of these.On Friday, Union health ministry sent out an advisory asking all central ministries to issue instructions to hospitals and public sector undertakings (PSUs) under their control to set up exclusive dedicated hospital wards or separate blocks within the hospitals for Covid care.“The directive is aimed at ensuring more beds are created for Covid-19 patients as there is being seen a surge. Many of these hospitals have the capacity to act as Covid care centres and can be made use of,” said a senior government official aware of the matter, who did not want to be identified.To meet the sudden surge in demand for medical oxygen, 162 pressure swing adsorption (PSA) oxygen plants have been sanctioned by the Centre for installation in public health facilities in all states. This step will provide additional supply of 154.19 metric tons of medical oxygen supply, the government said.Out of 162 PSA plants sanctioned, 33 have been installed— five in MP, four in Himachal Pradesh, three each in Chandigarh, Gujarat and Uttarakhand, two each in Bihar, Karnataka and Telangana; and one each in Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Delhi, Haryana, Kerala, Maharashtra, Puducherry, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh. By end of April, 2021, 59 more oxygen plants will be installed, and by end of May, around 80 more will get added, government has said. In addition to 162 plants already sanctioned, at least 100 additional plants are also being sanctioned on the request of several states.As part of its initiative to ramp up Remdesivir production, the ministry of chemicals and fertilisers on Sunday announced that soon 300,000 vials per day will be manufactured in the country to meet the demand.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-logs-275k-new-covid-19-cases-positivity-rate-doubles-101618771227425.html

We will be running Oxygen Express trains using green corridors to get Oxygen in bulk and rapidly to patients,” Union railways minister Piyush Goyal tweeted on Sunday.Tentatively, a movement plan has been made for dispatching 10 empty tankers on Monday, the ministry of railways said, adding that the transport secretary, Maharashtra, has assured to provide the tankers.Also read: Kin allege 12 died in MP due to ‘oxygen shortage’, govt, hospital dismiss claim“On 17.04.2021, a meeting was held between Railway Board officials and with State Transport Commissioners and representatives of industry on the subject of issues related to transportation of Liquid Medical Oxygen. It was decided that the tankers would be organised by Transport Commissioner, Maharashtra. These empty tankers would be moved from Kalamboli/Boisar, Railway stations in and near Mumbai, and sent to Vizag and Jamshedpur/Rourkela/Bokaro, for loading of liquid medical oxygen tankers from there,” read the ministry’s statement.“Zonal Railways have been informed regarding the demands from State Governments. CFTMs and PCOMs are in touch with the Industry and State Governments. Railway Board has directed concerned GMs to be fully prepared and proactively assist the State and Central Government Agencies in movement of Oxygen by rail.”With several states reporting a shortage of oxygen, the Centre on Friday ordered uninterrupted movement of medical oxygen carrying vehicles along their borders, adding that production and supply must not be curbed.“The First train with empty containers is expected to leave to Vizag tomorrow from Mumbai region. Containers are expected to get filled in Vizag...Information will be updated as more trains get operationalised and first oxygen loaded train leaves from the filling station,” railway ministry spokesperson said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rlys-to-run-oxygen-express-amid-high-demand-from-states-101618771227991.html
19-04-2021||Editorials||Oxygen shortage is due to incompetence | HT Editorial||The second wave of Covid-19 has led to a sharp surge in demand for hospital beds, medicines, and, crucially, oxygen. Last week, the Centre took several steps to tackle the problem of oxygen shortage. Prime Minister Narendra Modi directed authorities to ensure the movement of vehicles carrying medical oxygen. The government prohibited the supply of oxygen for industrial purposes to divert the stock for medical use, began a process to import 50,000 metric tonnes of medical oxygen, claimed that domestic production would double, and said that Indian Railways would run special trains to supply oxygen to states and Union Territories that are facing a shortage.While this are welcome, the scarcity of oxygen could have been avoided with better planning and proactive governance. According to news portal, Scroll.in, it took the Centre eight months to invite bids for new oxygen generation plants after India declared the pandemic to be a “disaster” on March 14, 2020. Surprisingly, the delay was not due to a lack of funds. The outlay for 162 oxygen plants is ₹201.58 crore, which had been allocated from the PM-Cares fund. However, only 33 plants are operational, according to the health ministry. This postponement, which is leading to the loss of lives, was a result of administrative inertia, and a flawed tendering process that awarded contracts to companies that are ill-equipped to do the work required. In some cases, state governments failed to provide the infrastructure to set up plants. Last year, a hard lockdown was imposed to ramp up the health infrastructure. The acute shortage of oxygen shows that a lot of critical infrastructure is yet to be set up, not just due to administrative incompetence but also misreading of the potency of Covid-19’s second wave.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/oxygen-shortage-is-due-to-incompetence-hteditorial-101618842992034.html
19-04-2021||Editorials||The science of the second wave | HT Editorial||India has now taken the global spotlight as the worst hotspot for Covid-19. The surge has triggered a key question. Is a variant of Sars-Cov-2 to blame? The question stems from the experiences of several other countries. The B.1.1.7 variant, first found in the United Kingdom, appears to trigger an entirely new wave of infections when it takes hold — this happened with England, then the rest of the island, followed by parts of Europe and the United States (US). Having gained an ability to spread more readily, B.1.1.7 has often required nothing less than a lockdown to slow it down.Now, a new variant has been spotted in India – B.1.617. Where it was found and how frequently it has been spotted are worrying indicators for what it may be able to do. It arose in Maharashtra, which began bucking the national trend of flat case trajectories almost a fortnight before infections began to rise elsewhere. The state was eventually forced into a lockdown. The variant is now popping up in other countries, where calls are growing to ban flights from India. Western scientists spotted a tell-tale trend in genome sequences submitted from India to the global GISAID repository — the variant was popping up more frequently in samples. These patterns reinforce the fear that B.1.617 may be fuelling India’s wave, although there is also a strong possibility the B.1.1.7 may have also taken hold. On March 24, health ministry officials said B.1.1.7 was found in large numbers in community samples in at least one state, Punjab.The answers to all these questions lie in better genomic surveillance. Till April 1, India sequenced only 0.67% of new cases recorded this year. The first of the clues from the sequences came not from Indian scientists but those from Scripps Research in US who spotted the growing footprint of B.1.617. Almost a month since the March 24 press conference by the health ministry, there is little detail of when and where these were discovered – data that could unlock the mystery of India’s second wave. If variants are a major factor, it has far-reaching consequences for how the country approaches containment (cities may need tougher curbs sooner) as well as its vaccination strategy (the country may require doses that are more resilient to mutations). It is about time these questions are answered, beginning with information about when and where the variant samples came from.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/the-science-of-the-second-wave-hteditorial-101618842752011.html
