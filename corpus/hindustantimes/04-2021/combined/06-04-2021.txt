The ADG himself visited Barabanki to examine the ambulance brought back from Ropar, Punjab, where it was found abandoned near a roadside eating joint on the Chandigarh-Nagal highway on Sunday evening.He said a team of road transport office and local police had got the technical examination done of the ambulance to find out what changes had been done in it violating the norms.He said the charges will be increased in the FIR lodged previously in this connection. Sabat said the private ambulance bearing a registration number of UP’s Barabanki was reportedly registered on the basis of a fake identity card of Mau resident Dr Alka Rai since December 2013. In the matter, the FIR was initially lodged with the city kotwali police of Barabanki district on the complaint of Barabanki assistant road transport officer (ARTO) Pankaj Singh.Dr Rai, the owner of a private hospital in Mau, had informed the police that she had no connection with Barabanki and had never set up any hospital there. She also claimed to have no idea how the ambulance was registered in her name in Barabanki. Earlier, the team had examined her signatures and matched them with those on the registration documents of the ambulance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/barabanki-police-seize-ambulance-get-tech-examination-done-101617733760636.html

He said at a time when the Central government was planning 100% coverage of consumers with prepaid meters by 2024, power consumers were anxious to get rid of smart meters and this was a serious issue.“Today, I have a discussion over phone with Union power secretary Alok Kumar and I urged him to ensure that prepaid meters that the Centre was planning to install were not based on the same technology because this was necessary to win consumers’ trust otherwise the project would not succeed,” said Verma, who is also state advisory committee member.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/fed-up-with-smart-meters-over-6-000-power-consumers-say-no-to-power-101617733640593.html
06-04-2021||Other||Panchayat polls: BJP releases second list||LUCKNOW: Days after revealing its first cut of candidates, which was a mix of various caste groups and in some cases having representation from Muslim minorities too, the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) declared the second list of candidates for the three-tier panchayat polls on Tuesday, much on the lines of how it releases lists for assembly and Lok Sabha polls. Like in bigger polls, the BJP leadership discussed names of candidates for these rural polls too and then the lists were officially released by the party. Immediately after the release, its leaders tasked with panchayat polls cheered up the cadre, saying their political opponents were trapped in internal dissension as well as confusion over candidate selection for the rural elections. “Many are seeing these polls as a semi-final ahead of 2022 UP polls. But people forget we have won all the polls since 2014 Lok Sabha polls,” the UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev said, emphasising on party’s preparedness While the BJP officially released lists of candidates for 18 districts, including key ones like Rampur, Rae Bareli, Sant Kabir Nagar and Bhadohi on Friday last itself, on Tuesday it released the lists for Azamgarh, Maharajganj, Etawah and Lalitpur. “Had it not been for fresh covid surge, we had planned some big rallies in villages. Now, of course, the campaign would be held in keeping with the covid protocol. The opposition appears to be nowhere in the race,” the party leaders have been telling the cadres in their regular briefings. Like the Samajwadi Party, the BSP too didn’t officially release candidate lists even as the BJP accused the Congress of not being able to find enough candidates for these polls even in Rae Bareli, the Lok Sabha constituency of Congress chief Sonia Gandhi, a point that has been finding regular mention in all BJP campaign related to these polls. The BJP campaign is mostly centered around how the farm laws are beneficial for the farmers and that the party leadership is open to farmers’ concerns and willing to make changes in the farm laws. Other parts of the campaign include a publicity brochure containing various schemes initiated for the poor. Privately, BJP leaders admit that at many places they expect a BJP vs SP contest in the state’s countryside where several political parties, new to the state, too are trying their luck. These include parties like the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and Asaduddin Owaisi’s AIMIM, which are looking at these rural polls as a chance to test the water before deciding whether to contest the 2022 UP assembly polls that would follow soon after these polls. However, it is the BJP that has declared maximum candidates so far and hasn’t witnessed any major bickering, barring the one in Jhansi when its district chief had to beat a hasty retreat amid protest by local cadres. Having decided on a phased announcement of candidates, and having built considerable hype around these rural polls, the party’s first list of announcements made on Friday, even contained districts that go to polls in the second phase. “That shows our planning. Chitrakoot and Kannauj will go to polls in the second phase and yet, we announced them. We also named candidates for 52 wards of Rae Bareli. How many has Congress named,” asked BJP lawmaker Vijay Bahadur Pathak, the party’s UP in-charge for panchayat polls. In certain districts like Kannauj and Ghaziabad, the BJP, accused of not fielding many Muslim candidates, has also fielded candidates from the community. Lalji Verma, BSP’s legislature party leader in UP Assembly, however, dismissed BJP’s claim of being well prepared. “BJP is the ruling party and naturally is ‘well prepared’. If they are so confident, they should have contested the elections to the post of pradhan (village head) and block development council (BDC) member on their ticket,” said Verma.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/panchayat-polls-bjp-releases-second-list-101617733580793.html

06-04-2021||Noida||Noida: Spike makes April worst Covid month this year||April has been the worst month so far this year in Gautam Budh Nagar as the Sars-CoV-2 virus spread in the district. The first six days of the month reported 485 cases, almost 81 cases a day, and two deaths.The disease spread seemed to have been in control since December last year with no death reported since January 5.With Uttar Pradesh not showing any signs of a lockdown till now, unlike Delhi and Maharashtra, district magistrate (DM) Suhas LY said the main aim of the administration was to reduce keep the case fatality rate (CFR) from rising, while simultaneously increasing testing.“We are worried with this sudden surge in new cases this month. To check the spread, besides adapting the ‘track, test and treat’ methodology, we have also started focussing on contact tracing. A 10-member contact tracing team, on Tuesday, traced at least 25 primary and secondary contacts of 93 infected patients. The RT-PCR samples of all the contacts have been taken and the health officials will reason out the cause of sudden spike in active cases on the basis of their reports,” he said.The DM said that besides proper sanitization in containment zones, they have begun thorough checking of industrial units. “Stern action will be taken against those commercial and industrial units disobeying standard Covid-19 protocol within their premises. This decision has been taken in view of the large number of workers coming from different areas,” he said.He also said that the district administration has also issued advisories for factories and other industrial establishments to strictly follow safety protocols. “Six teams, with the help of district industries department, have been constituted to inspect whether safety protocols are being followed in workplaces and factories. During an inspection of different industrial units today, the district industry department officials found that Covid protocols are being violated in a biscuit factory. The ADM (sadar), who is also the incident commander of that area, has issued a show-cause to the factory owner. If the reply will not be satisfactory, action against the owner will be taken as per the provisions of Pandemic Act, 1997 and section 188 (Disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) of the Indian Penal Code,” Suhas said.Chief medical officer (CMO) Dr Deepak Ohri said daily testing has been increased and rapid antigen kit testing camps are being organised regularly at different places in the district. “The district has stepped up monitoring of patients in home isolation. The health department’s surveillance teams have started implementing stringent containment rules. Early hospitalisation of patients needing medical support and efficient infection control at health care facilities are our top priorities,” he said.Ohri also said that 8,605 persons were vaccinated on Tuesday at altogether 85 inoculation centres in the district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-spike-makes-april-worst-covid-month-this-year-101617732680626.html
06-04-2021||Noida||With spike in cases, state government ropes in special teams for Ghaziabad, GB Nagar||Ghaziabad: The Uttar Pradesh government on Tuesday decided to send special teams to different districts, including Ghaziabad and Gautam Budh Nagar, which are witnessing spike in fresh Covid-19 cases. The teams will take up a review of testing and treatment facilities in the respective districts, officials said. According to the state’s daily Covid-19 bulletin released on Tuesday, the districts of Ghaziabad and GB Nagar have 410 and 579 active cases, respectively, while two deaths due to Covid-19 have also taken place in GB Nagar in the past two days. Overall, there were 5,928 fresh cases on Tuesday in the state, showed the data. “The chief minister has directed that special teams, which include special secretary rank officers and other officers from the health and medical education departments, to be sent to the districts having high caseload. These include districts like Lucknow, Varanasi, Ghaziabad, GB Nagar, Bareilly, Kanpur, Prayagraj, and Jhansi, among others,” said Navneet Sehgal, UP’s additional chief secretary (information). “The teams will take a review of testing and treatment facilities and about the preparations being made by the respective districts. They will also ensure that the best treatment and facilities available are given to the Covid-19 patients,” he added. In Ghaziabad, the sample positivity rate has spiked over 1% in April and stands at 1.36% in first five days with 324 positive reports resulting out of total 23,878 reports. The last time sample positivity rate had gone over 1% was in December 2020 when it was 2.99% (3,034 positive reports of 101,496 total reports). The positivity rates had, however, remained below 1% in the months of January (0.74%), February (0.31%) and March (0.69%) this year. Sample positivity rate refers to the number of samples testing positive per 100 samples tested. Sometimes, patients take more than one test for confirmation and so, total positive samples can be higher than total positive cases, the officials explained. “We have special surveillance drives taken up in high caseload residential areas. Besides, our teams are working to take up testing, contact tracing and allocation of facility for Covid patients. We have also directed hospitals to be ready and arrange sufficient number of beds in order to deal with a surge in Covid cases. In our district, the situation is under control and we are geared up to deal with any upsurge,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate, Ghaziabad. In terms of number of Covid cases, the district during first five days of April has witnessed 256 news cases with 42 in residential segment of Carte (comprising localities like Shastri Nagar), 37 in Indirapuram, 32 in Sahibabad, 34 in Vaishali and 15 in Vasundhara, among others. In the month of March, the district had registered a total of 565 cases. Suhas LY, district magistrate of GB Nagar, said that the positivity rate has risen in GB Nagar as well. “The state government had sent a team last year. We will be taking up review with the special team arriving this year too. It will be better in terms of forming strategy and deal with fresh Covid upsurge,” he added. In its April 3 order, the state government issued guidelines for identification of containment zones in residential areas and group housing societies, but did not put any restriction on movement of people in a containment zone. Experts said that movement of people will have to be restricted to check the spread of infection. “If there is no restriction on movement of people in and out of containment zones, it is of no use. At present, we are not seeing much of enforcement against people not wearing mask and not maintaining social distancing,” said Dr Ashish Agarwal, president of Indian Medical Association -- Ghaziabad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/with-spike-in-cases-state-government-ropes-in-special-teams-for-ghaziabad-gb-nagar-101617732380572.html

06-04-2021||Noida||Pests enter homes, say residents of Vasundhara||Ghaziabad: With the Covid-19 pandemic already making lives difficult, residents of Ghaziabad’s Vasundhara are now confronted with another challenge – pests.According to residents, seasonal pests like mealybugs and other insects have swarmed the area in strength. The bugs, which are confined mostly to trees, especially mango trees, are also entering their homes pointing to proliferation, they said. Mealybugs are small, white, un-armoured insects that spread during the warmer seasons and act as pests to the vegetation.“We have been facing this issue for the past few weeks. We would see these bugs in the nearby parks and trees every year in this season, but this time their population has boosted a lot. We can even spot them in our houses now. Our sector is greener than others, with several trees, as compared to other sectors, which perhaps could be why we are faced with this menace. What makes it worse is that that very little has been done about the issue,” said Anjani Prasad, a resident of Block B, Vasundhara.Another resident stated that after people started raising the issue, pesticide was sprayed about a week ago but its effect soon wore out.“This year we are seeing more insects in our neighbourhood, especially the small, white mealybugs. A week back, one worker from the civic agency was sent who tried to spray pesticides on these bugs but the effect wore out fast and these bugs started to increase in numbers again. We can see them everywhere now,” said G Suryanarain Rao, another resident of Block B.“These small, white insects have spread all over the area and a single spray of pesticide seems to be ineffective,” said Rajnesh Nautiya, another local.Meanwhile, officials of the Ghaziabad municipal corporation (GMC) said that they were unaware of the issue and will look into the matter.“I have not received any such complaint or seen any such issue. The matter concerns the health department,” said Sumit Kumar Rai, zonal officer, Vasundhara, GMC.The corporation’s health official said that they will look into the matter.“The insects are seasonal, though we have not received any specific complaint yet, at least not to my knowledge. But we will look into the matter and get it resolved,” said Dr Mithlesh Kumar, heath officer, GMC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/pests-enter-homes-say-residents-of-vasundhara-101617731720524.html

The suspect, identified as Jahrul alias Chhotu of West Bengal, worked as a construction supervisor and lived in a rented accommodation in Sector 46. Police identified the victim as 30-year-old Shaheen Nur Miyan. Assistant commissioner of police Preet Pal Sangwan said that Chhotu worked with the victim and had recently made a profit of ₹4 lakh from a construction project. Police said Chhotu gave the money to his wife but after an argument broke out between the couple in January-end, she took the money and left for her village in West Bengal along with her brother. Despite trying for three months, police said the woman refused to return the money to Chhotu. His brother-in-law also refused to intervene and even stopped talking to him.Sangwan said on March 27, Chhotu called his brother-in-law for drinks at a ground in Sector 47. After a few drinks, the suspect questioned him about his wife, only to be allegedly told that she wouldn’t come to back to him or return his money.“The victim had told the suspect that his sister had spent nearly ₹1 lakh and given him his share of ₹1.25 lakh. He also made fun of the suspect and said he deserved to live without his wife and money as he often fought with her. The deceased started laughing, following which the suspect got furious. He picked up a grinding stone lying near the spot and smashed his face and head repeatedly,” said Sangwan. He then allegedly hid the stone near the spot and fled from the ground. “Fearing police action, Chhotu did not return to his rented room and was living at different areas,” said Sangwan. A driver who used to park his car in the ground informed police control room that a body was lying in a pool of blood, following which a team reached the spot and found a mobile phone ringing at the spot. Police informed the victim’s wife and asked her to identify the body. A case of murder was registered at Sadar police station on March 28 and police arrested the suspect, who had boarded a bus from Iffco Chowk for Delhi, on Monday.Police said they recovered the stone from the spot and he was taken on a two-day police remand for further investigation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/man-bludgeons-brother-in-law-to-death-with-grinding-stone-arrested-101617731662545.html
06-04-2021||Gurugram||RTA announces subsidies, scrap costs to replace old diesel autos with e-rickshaws||The regional transport authority (RTA), in a bid to ensure that banned diesel auto-rickshaws older than 10 years are taken off the roads and scrapped, announced an initiative to replace such vehicles with e-rickshaws at no extra cost for vehicle owners. Setting a September 2021 deadline for the same, officials familiar with the matter said they will offer subsidies and scrap costs to vehicle owners for easily procuring e-rickshaws.Dhaarna Yadav, secretary, RTA, Gurugram, said a decision was taken to scrap old diesel auto-rickshaws as these were found plying despite being banned. “The decision to phase out the pollution-emitting auto-rickshaws was taken because of the growing contamination of ambient air, which has deteriorated to the worst level in the city,” said Yadav.Officials said that replacing diesel auto-rickshaws is important to ensure better air quality, as such vehicles severely impact the air quality, especially during winter, when the situation is compounded by falling temperatures and fog. Currently, 50,000 diesel auto-rickshaws are plying on the city roads, of which around 12,000 are older than 10 years. However, the RTA could not provide information on the number of e-rickshaws currently operational in the city.“The commuters will not be hit by this decision as we are not only phasing out diesel auto-rickshaws but also replacing them with e-rickshaws so that last-mile connectivity is not affected,” Yadav said.However, experts expressed concern over diminishing last-mile connectivity options, as the city is heavily reliant on the shared diesel auto-rickshaws, which are easily accessible and cost comparatively much less than cab services or private auto-rickshaws.Sewa Ram, head of the department of transport planning at the School of Planning and Architecture (SPA) in Delhi, said that it is a good decision to introduce e-rickshaws provided they are integrated with the bus connectivity so that people do not have to bargain and pay digitally once they step out of the bus.“The department has to ensure the last-mile connectivity is in place and the fares are fixed. The facility should be from point to point so that the drivers cannot deny passengers any route. There should be two models, one which is driven at a fixed speed and only four people can board, and another where speed is not a constrain,” he said.He said that e-rickshaw rides will cost commuters more than diesel auto-rickshaw rides, as an e-rickshaw can only accommodate four passengers, compared to eight in diesel auto-rickshaws. Also, there will be problems if e-rickshaw drivers refuse long commutes and that the onus is on the authorities to ensure this does not happen.Officials familiar with the matter said that Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar will inaugurate the e-rickshaws on April 9 in the city.“The process of registration and driving licence for these e-rickshaws will be done on priority at the RTA office. We will provide e-rickshaw owners registration certificates within 72 hours of applying. Charging stations have already been set up and more will be put up according to the rising demand. We are helping drivers with the chief minister’s subsidy and MCG subsidy along with ₹12,000 from scrap. Finance schemes have been worked out so that drivers hardly need to pay any extra amount,” Yadav said.Yadav said that more than 100 charging stations have been set up in Udyog Vihar, South City and Golf Course Road.Palash Roy Chowdhury, co-founder, chairman and managing director of SmartE, an e-rickshaw manufacturer that has tied up with the RTA, said, “The project will provide safe, convenient and affordable last-mile services to citizens of the Millennium City while increasing the daily earning of the drivers. Plus, it will save tens of thousands of tonnes of carbon emissions.”Chowdhury said that an electric vehicle will cost nearly ₹1.75 lakh, including registration cost. He said that a finance scheme was worked out, wherein a driver can ₹400- ₹450 per day.Auto-rickshaw drivers, however, were unhappy with the move and said they will not invest in e-rickshaws as they are not confident that the department will set up enough charging stations. They alleged that auto-rickshaw stands that were promised long ago are yet to be created and that the move is an eyewash.Yogesh Sharma, the state general secretary of the Haryana Auto Chalak Sanghatan, said e-rickshaws are not a feasible option as they are not suitable for long distances. “This e-rickshaw will be used for a short distance and if any passenger wants to go to Manesar, it will take more than three hours in these rickshaws,” he said, adding that they are not supporting this initiative and it is not welcomed by the drivers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/rta-announces-subsidies-scrap-costs-to-replace-old-diesel-autos-with-erickshaws-101617731661812.html

They will be sensitised about the environmental harms caused by operating diesel auto-rickshaws and will be explained the MCG’s policy, including monetary aids, for switching to e-rickshaws.MCG officials said that traffic police and RTA officials will also attend the meeting. “The main purpose of the meeting is for generating awareness among diesel auto-rickshaw owners and drivers. The MCG will explain to them the environmental damages caused through running auto-rickshaws on diesel and the long-term economic benefits of e-rickshaws due to considerable lower running and maintenance costs,” said Bhadana.Bhadana said that the MCG will be providing a grant of around ₹50,000 to diesel auto-rickshaw drivers and owners, while around ₹30,000 will be given as scrap costs, provided the diesel auto-rickshaw is scrapped by an agency authorised by the Haryana government.“The purchaser concerned can procure any e-rickshaw of their choice. We are aiming to launch all 2,000 e-rickshaws within the next three months,” said Bhadana, adding that the RTA will provide e-rickshaw owners registration certificates (RC) within 72 hours of applying.Bhadana said that the MCG will be the regulatory body for all the 2,000 e-rickshaws and will also determine a fixed fare, based on point-to-point distances.Bhadana said that the MCG has also finalised a contractor for assisting diesel auto-rickshaw drivers and owners with all the necessary documentation to procure loans for purchasing e-rickshaws.In September last year, HT had reported that the MCG floated a tender to select a contractor for this task and that the civic body is looking to introduce 2,000 new e-rickshaws in the city. MCG officials said that the 2,000 e-rickshaws are being launched in the first phase of the project and once the conversion figure is attained, they will roll out 5,000 more e-rickshaws.In September 2016, the then MCG additional commissioner, Amit Khatri, came up with a plan of launching 1,000 app-based e-rickshaws in the city along with an app-based company for last-mile connectivity to residents from areas located near rapid metro stations.This plan, however, never came to fruition, and the same company launched 500 e-rickshaws a year later at stations of the Delhi Metro in the city.MCG officials privy to the matter said that Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar may also launch a batch of new e-rickshaws in the city on Friday, as the RTA seeks to replace banned autos with e-rickshaws.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/mcg-to-introduce-2-000-e-rickshaws-will-hold-meeting-with-owners-of-diesel-autos-101617731661120.html

Officials said that the flyover will be constructed on the sector-dividing road, between Huda City Centre and Subhash Chowk. “We have made a proposal with detailed report for constructing a flyover at the Bakhtawar Chowk, which will help in managing traffic and ease the vehicular congestion at the intersection. The flyover, which will be around 500-600 metres long, will be made in the direction of Subhash Chowk, towards Huda City Centre, passing over the intersection,” said a senior GMDA official, requesting anonymity. Traffic from Rajiv Chowk, Subhash Chowk, Huda City Centre and Mayfield Gardens converge at Bakhtawar Chowk, making it one of the most congested spots in the city. As per GMDA’s own comprehensive mobility plan (CMP) compiled by the School of Planning and Architecture (SPA), the junction has a vehicle accumulation count of 8,545 between 6pm and 7pm.As per the CMP, roads leading from Subhash Chowk and Huda City Centre, running west to east, have six lanes, with service roads on both sides and a right-of-way of 60 metres. However, the roads leading from Rajiv Chowk and Mayfield Gardens, running north to south, have four lanes, with a right-of-way ranging from 30-36 metres. Due to the differences in the width of carriageways, the junction is not aligned. As a result, it takes more time for motorists travelling from Subhash Chowk and Huda City Centre to cross the junction, leading to congestion and snarls.The GMDA official cited above said that the flyover will help commuters to avoid the traffic signal at the Bakhtawar Chowk. “At present, commuters have to stop at Subhash Chowk and then again at Bakhtawar Chowk, but with the flyover, commuters will be able to avoid one signal and go straight. The flyover will be double lane and so, movement will be easy both up and down,” the official said. The cost of construction has been estimated at over ₹60 crore and construction will start soon after approval. Officials said that the flyover should be functional by April 2022. Along with the flyover, work will also be undertaken to develop service lanes under the flyover and making left turns free at the intersection. For easing traffic congestion, the GMDA has already installed a smart traffic signal at Bakhtawar Chowk along with six other places in the city. A smart traffic signal is an automated one that takes into account the volume of traffic on a realtime basis. Officials will also put forth a proposal for extending GMDA’s coverage to the entirety of the Gurugram district in the meeting. In March, the authority initiated a proposal to extend the jurisdictional boundaries of GMDA as well as extend the Gurugram Metropolitan Area (GMA) to help with connectivity and management issues. The authority officials said they received five “positive” responses in this regard.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/flyover-at-bakhtawar-chowk-to-smoothen-traffic-flow-101617731660511.html

06-04-2021||Gurugram||Admin issues protocols to RWAs and malls, asks residents to work from home||The district administration on Tuesday issued standard operating procedures to residents’ welfare associations and managements of malls and shopping complexes because of the increasing Covid-19 infections in the city. The administration officials appealed to the public to avoid travelling and work from home, if possible, and recommended RWAs to maintain a record of residents travelling by air and share the details with the authorities concerned for better tracking of cases.Ritesh Ranjan, divisional commissioner, Gurugram, who chaired a meeting of senior officials on the matter on Tuesday, directed the police and the district administration to enforce social distancing and mask discipline strictly.The district administration recommended that residents, who have travelled abroad, should inform the same to the RWAs, self-quarantine for two weeks and in case of symptoms, get themselves tested. The RWAs were also directed to share information about such residents with the health department.In the last three weeks, the city has witnessed rapid spread of the Covid-19 infection. The district reported 3,355 active cases on Tuesday evening, a sharp spike from around 600 active cases on March 15. There has been sharp rise in positivity rate as well, from 2.5% to 7.8% in this period. Taking cognizance of the fact that Gurugram has a large number of high-rise buildings, Ranjan said that directions must be issued to private condominiums and offices disallowing more than two persons to travel in an elevator at a go. He also directed the district administration to keep a tab on social functions and gatherings, as the wedding season will start soon and it has to be ensured that Covid-appropriate behaviours are adhered to. “The threat posed by Covid-19 is still very serious and as such, everyone must follow the safeguards and avoid undue travel. Everyone needs to keep strict vigil as this is a critical time,” Ranjan said in the meeting. Pradip Rahi, the president of Ramprastha City RWA said that they will follow the directions issued by the district administration, but it would be tough to get travel details from individual residents due to fear of harassment. “We have already asked the security detail and estate management to track the movement of visitors. Checking (temperatures) with infrared thermometers has already started. We will also request residents to share travel details as it will help stop the spread of Covid-19,” he said. Another resident, who wished anonymity, said that they will not share details with the RWA as this would compromise their privacy. “The RWAs should be kept under check or else, they start dictating terms and this makes life miserable for many,” the resident said. The deputy commissioner for Gurugram, Yash Garg, said that the administration’s permission must be taken, besides a no-objection certificate from the police and other departments, for all social functions related to education, entertainment, politics, sports and culture, among others.Due to the rising Covid-19 infections, the Gurugram administration capped the limit for indoor functions at 200, not exceeding half the capacity, while extending the cap to 500 for outdoor spaces. Garg said, “The committees formed at subdivision, tehsil and block levels will conduct inspections in their areas and enforce the safeguards prescribed for curbing the spread of Covid-19,” said Garg, adding that strict action would be taken against violators who don’t follow the safety protocols, such as wearing masks, maintaining social distancing and similar safety rules.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/admin-issues-protocols-to-rwas-and-malls-asks-residents-to-work-from-home-101617731601619.html

Mural paintings now adorn the 30-year-old boundary wall of Noida Golf Course (NGC) on Sector 43 that previously used to be in a dilapidated condition. From a golfer swinging a shot to that of another golfer putting, the art along the 450-metre long wall captures the essence of the Noida Golf Course. The work started in the first week of February and will end this week. The project was commissioned by the Noida Authority and funded by HCL as part of its Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) requirement. A Noida-based social enterprise called Ecoswop Solutions was roped in to carry out the designing and painting work. “The wall has an area of over 10,000 sq feet which has taken over two months to complete. We have kept the art work very colourful and the design is such that every golfer who sees it will view themselves in it in different stances. We hope the artwork will deter people from dirtying the wall as we have worked hard to beautify it,” says Tarunima Bajpai from Ecoswop Solutions. Golfers not just from Noida but across NCR come to the Noida Golf Course for golfing and are a happy lot after the makeover. “The boundary wall of the NGC was in a sad state of affairs for the past few years. However, the vibrant makeover of the wall is a refreshing change as it represents Noida on the golfing circuit in NCR,” says Kiran Chaudhary, a member of NGC, Ladies Club. Moreover, in December, another wall on the other side of the main road was also given a makeover. The artwork here has been done on the theme of corona warriors and it depicts not just doctors and health workers but also policemen and sanitation workers. “Apart from the wall art, a mural of golf sticks have also been put up at the roundabout infront of the Gold Course in order to project the area as a golf lovers’ hub,” Noida Authority CEO Ritu Maheshwari said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/over-30-year-old-noida-golf-course-boundary-wall-gets-a-makeover-101617731602236.html

06-04-2021||Noida||Sahibabad villages oppose new traffic plan for Kaushambi||Four villages in Sahibabad Site IV Industrial Area said they would oppose the Ghaziabad administration’s attempts to divert Delhi-Kaushambi traffic through their area. Residents there say that the plan would further pollute the villages.The plan was drawn up in response to a Supreme Court (SC) directive last month on the plea of Kaushambi residents. The court had then ordered the formation of a nine-member committee whose nodal officer would be the Ghaziabad district magistrate (DM) Ajay Shankar Pandey. The committee had members from the district administration, district police and Delhi officials.It proposed that the traffic, including UP Roadways buses, be diverted through Saur Urja Marg.The four-laned Saur Urja Marg is about 7-8kms stretch and connects near Kaushambi ISBT to Vasundhara intersection and passes through Sahibabad Site IV Industrial Area, which the central pollution control board had identified as an air pollution hot spot.But residents of four villages, Kadkad Model, Maharjpur, Sahibabad and Jhandapur, feel that the plan would affect them badly.Sushil Raghav, a city-based environmentalist and resident of Kadkad Model, said, “The industrial area is already polluted, and diversion of buses and vehicles will further intensify the problem. It is just an attempt to give relief to Kaushambi at our expense. We have sent representation to UP chief secretary and other officers and we will move Supreme Court if traffic is diverted through our area.”“The industrial area already has vehicles which remain parked on roads and if the plan is cleared, more vehicles will be diverted here and compound the issue. This will also increase risk of accidents for cyclists, children and daily commuters,” said Haji Arif, resident of Maharajpur one of the four villages . The four villages together have a population of around 300,000 to 400,000.“The latest plan including suggestions from UP and Delhi is only a draft and not a final plan,” said district magistrate Pandey. “Saur Urja Marg is proposed for diversion of buses. However, if residents have any issues, we will give them time and invite public objection for resolution of their issues.”In the plan, the authorities have also proposed enforcement against illegal buses and autos, removal of encroachment, regulation of permits of autos and e-rickshaws besides diversions and other traffic infrastructure measures in order to decongest and abate polluted surroundings at Kaushambi. They have also proposed parking spaces and a multi-level parking at Kaushambi metro station. The Supreme Court’s March 24 order was in response to Kaushambi residents welfare association (Karwa) that said the pollution in their area, which is close to two inter state bus terminals, had to be controlled. VK Mittal, president of Karwa, said that he could not comment over the issue of Saur Urja Marg. “If the residents of four villages have plan, they can move court with their issue. It is up to the court to decide their issue. Regarding the latest plan, we have issues and will submit our comments before the court,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/sahibabad-villages-oppose-new-traffic-plan-for-kaushambi-101617731420589.html
06-04-2021||Noida||Noida authority to revise interest rate on land dues as per SC order||NOIDA: Responding to Noida Authority’s request for directions on matter of interest to be levied on real estate developers’ land dues, the Uttar Pradesh government on Monday asked it to resolve the issue as per rules.The direction clears the way for the authority to calculate the net amount due to it based on a previous Supreme Court (SC) order and move to begin registration of flats to thousands of homebuyers.In July last year the SC directed the authority to charge only 8.5% interest rate. Earlier, it would charge up to 25% in some cases. The Noida authority estimated that it had to receive ₹25,000 crore in land dues, as per its earlier interest rate. The officials are yet to calculate a figure based on the revised rates.The UP government also allowed developers to pay land dues on a per flat basis. It means if developers want to execute flat registry of 10 flats to homebuyers then they should accept financial dues in proportion to the 10 flats and allow registry. Earlier, the authority had wanted the developer to clear all dues and then execute registry.“But the developers will have to submit an affidavit stating that they will have to immediately resolve financial dues issue for once as per final order of SC,” said Rajesh Kumar officer on special duty of the Noida authority.The developers had long been demanding that the authority calculate the financial dues based on the Supreme Court order. They had said that they were ready to submit an affidavit stating they will pay remaining if needed as per a fresh order if it comes in future in this case. The lack of clarity over the interest rates meant that homebuyers could not get their flats registered. “Now we may take the proposal (of new rates and affidavit) submitted by the developers on board for a decision. And we will follow the directions taken in the board in future,” said Ritu Maheshwari chief executive officer of the Noida authority. Builders welcomed the order.“Following the SC order, it will benefit around 20,000 flat buyers, and developers,” said RK Arora, Uttar Pradesh president of national real estate Developers Corporation.On July 10, 2020 the Supreme Court, while hearing petitions in a matter regarding the Amrapali Group, directed Noida Authority to only charge an interest rate of 8.5%, as per the marginal cost of funds-based lending rate (MCLR) on land cost, fixed by the Reserve Bank of India, on land dues of developers. The order came in response to Noida-based developer ACE Group, through a plea, demanded that the “unreasonable” interest rate on group housing land should be looked into. ACE Group’s plea was clubbed with the Amrapali case. However the authority is yet to settle the financial issues of the developers in the light of the SC order because it has challenged the SC order in the Apex court. The SC will hear the authority plea challenging decision on interest on April 12. The developers had requested that the authority should calculate financial dues as per SC order with 8.5% until further decision is taken by the SC. The Noida authority had sought approvals from the UP government on this demand.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-authority-to-revise-interest-rate-on-land-dues-as-per-sc-order-101617731300469.html

Secretary, Examination Regulatory Authority, Anil Bhushan Chaturvedi sent a missive in this regard to postpone this examination scheduled on April 18 and conduct it after the panchayat elections. Polling is set to be held in 16 districts of UP on April 19 in the second phase of the panchayat polls, for which polling parties will leave by April 18. These 16 districts, which will see voting on April 19, include Muzaffarnagar, Baghpat, Gautam Buddh Nagar, Bijnor, Amroha, Badaun, Etah, Mainpuri, Kannauj, Etawah, Lalitpur, Chitrakoot, Pratapgarh, Lucknow, Lakhimpur Kheri, Sultanpur, Gonda, Maharajganj, Varanasi and Azamgarh. The move to postpone the recruitment exams follows district magistrates of various districts writing to the secretary of Examination Regulatory Authority pointing out that the entire administrative machinery would be busy during the elections. Due to this, it would not be possible for them to conduct the examination on April 18. “We have received letters from DMs of different districts, which would hold panchayat polls on April 19, because of which we have submitted the proposal to the state government with the request that the proposed exam of April 18 be postponed,” confirmed Anil Bhushan Chaturvedi, secretary, Examination Regulatory Authority, UP. Hindustan Times had highlighted this issue in its report – ‘Teachers in a fix over panchayat poll duty and recruitment exam’, published on March 4. This development is a relief for thousands of teachers and other government employees of government-run primary and upper primary schools, who had applied to appear in this recruitment drive and had been demanding postponement of the exam. They feared that they would be deprived of the opportunity to appear in this recruitment examination due to panchayat poll duty. Significantly, more than 3.25 lakh candidates had applied for this recruitment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/exam-regulatory-authority-seeks-to-defer-teachers-recruitment-exam-101617731120601.html

As a result, the crowd is shifted to the other two booths in the hospital,” lamented Mahendra Pratap, a resident of Narhi, waiting for his number at the booth on Tuesday.In the last one week, a number of VVIPs have taken their vaccine at the Civil Hospital booth.He said, “Two vaccination counters at Civil Hospital present a different view. The one for the common man is overcrowded while the other one for the VIPs has all Covid protocols in place including social distancing and cleanliness. The counter for the common man has a small waiting area and bigger crowd while the VVIP booth is bigger with less crowd.”“The waiting area here is small as compared to the VVIP booth,” said NN Pandey, a senior citizen. However, Dr SK Nanda, medical superintendent, Civil Hospital, said: “One must think before accusing the hospital of partisan approach, We have limited staff vaccinating around 600 to 850 people every day and have three vaccination booths. From today, we have started issuing tokens for vaccination and everyone is called accordingly. Even VVIPs are made to wait in a separate room for their turn.”He said, “In case of any complaint, people can approach us. Everyone knows we are serving at three booths with limited staff who have not taken leave for the last few months. One of them tested positive a few days back after a Covid patient came for vaccination. One of our doctors also tested positive last week. Before accusing doctors of partisan approach people should follow rules. They must come when their token number is called out.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/vaccination-counters-a-picture-of-contrast-under-one-roof-at-civil-hosp-101617730642061.html

06-04-2021||Patna||Tejashwi campaigns for Trinamool in Bengal, fields party veterans too||Keeping his promise of campaigning for the Trinamool Congress in the West Bengal Assembly polls, RJD leader Tejashwi Prasad Yadav not only addressed his first election meeting at Kidderpore recently, but also deployed at least 10 MLAs from Saran, Gopalganj and Siwan in the neighbouring state to canvass support for Mamata Banerjee’s party among voters having their origins in Bihar. “Though the programme is being held In Kolkata, I feel I am in Chapra,” Yadav started off his speech at Kidderpore on Sunday to canvass for Trinamool’s prominent face and urban development minister Firhad Hakim alias Bobby Hakim, who is in the fray from Kolkata port constituency. Kolkata has a good number of people hailing from Saran, which has been an RJD stronghold “I have asked my party MLAs from Chapra, Gopalganj and Siwan to canvass strongly in favour of the Trinamool. They will be here for sometime,” he said. A Bhojpuri singer, Pramod Premi Yadav , who has done several numbers eulogizing Tejashwi before the 2020 Bihar polls, also regaled the crowd at the election meeting. “ He was roped in by local organisers. He is a popular name among Bhojpuri singers and well known in various cities, including in Kolkata,” said Sanjay Yadav, a close aide of Tejashwi, who was present at the Kidderpore meeting. In the ongoing West Bengal polls, Bihar natives settled in Kolkata and other towns like Asansol, Durgapur and Raniganj are crucial for the ruling Trinamool as well as rival BJP, a reason why both parties have sought help of their leaders from Bihar and UP. Tejashwi was unsparing in his attack on the BJP at the election meeting, where he raised issues of price rise, unemployment and economic contraction. He also accused the BJP-led NDA government at the Centre of blocking all employment avenues in government sector by privatizing railways, telecom, coal and selling off PSUs. Striking an emotional note, Tejashwi said Mamata Banerjee and his jailed father and RJD chief Lalu Prasad shared a close bond.”Mamata didi has always stood with Laluji. She respects him a lot.”The leade of Opposition in Bihar, whose party has extended support to Trinamool in Bengal polls by not fielding any candidate, would be holding election rallies at various constituencies in Kolkata, like Chowrangee, Jorashanko and also in Asansol and Raniganj after April 15 ahead of the last few phases of Bengal polls, RJD sources said. The BJP, however, said it’s not worried. “Tejashwi is not such a political stalwart that he would able to check Trinamool’s slide and help it to return to power in Bengal polls,” said Arvind Singh, BJP’s state spokesperson. He also slammed the RJD leader for campaigning for Trinamool whose chief had made disparaging comments against people from Bihar and UP before the Nandigram polls by saying BJP had brought in goons from two states to intimidate voters. “TMC chief has never called Biharis or people from UP goons. She had said BJP goons had come from two states,” said Chittaranjan Gagan, RJD’s state spokesperson.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/tejashwi-campaigns-for-trinamool-in-bengal-fields-party-veterans-too-101617727220144.html

The lone MLA siding with the NDA candidate has come as a huge embarrassment to the LJP, which has been at the loggerheads with JD (U) since the Bihar Assembly polls in November 2020. The party had fielded 143 candidates during assembly elections, which caused damage to JD(U) on many seats. A month back, the lone LJP MLA had sparked speculation of joining JD(U) following his meeting with the chief minister and a state minister.

06-04-2021||Dehradun||Uttarakhand HC takes suo moto cognisance of alarming forest fires||Taking suo moto cognisance of the alarming forest fires in the state, Uttarakhand High Court on Tuesday summoned principal chief convertor of forests (PCCF) Rajiv Bhartari to explain the preparedness of the state forest department and measures that have been taken over the years. The PCCF has been directed to attend the meeting on Wednesday through video-conferencing. Dushyant Mainali, an advocate, said he had mentioned the raging forest in the state before the HC on Monday, following which the court took cognisance and heard the matter on Tuesday. “The court said it understands that measures are being taken now, but what about the preparedness and measures taken before the forest fires to check them. The PCCF will have to explain this to the court at 10 am during the hearing on Wednesday through video-conferencing”, he said. Mainali said he also submitted various documents and media reports, including one by HT, before the court. “The court also expressed its concern over the smoke that is emanating from the forest fires and affecting the locals, especially during Covid times when many patients face breathing problems,” he said. Also read: Uttarakhand forest minister posts video fighting forest fire with twigs, slammedMainali said he also raised the issue of the 2004 state government order that had talked about community participation on a major level through van panchayats for checking forest fires in the state. This is not the first time when the courts have expressed their concerns about forest fires in the state. Taking cognisance of the raging forest fires in the state in 2016, when over 4,400 hectares of forest land had been damaged, the HC had directed the state to appoint at least 10,000 fire watchers to keep a tab on forest fire incidents and check them.In May 2018, the HC while taking suo moto cognisance of the forest fires in the state, directed the state government to submit the details of the forest fires, the kind of damage and the steps taken by the government to prevent them. In its response, the state government informed the HC that 90% of the forest fires in the state were “manmade”. Surprised, the HC remarked, “We were very shocked to hear the reply of the government. How is it possible when people have migrated from thousands of villages, they have a role in 90% of the forest fires in the state”. In June 2019, a public interest litigation (PIL) on forest fires in Uttarakhand highlighted that forest fires were wiping out entire species of birds, small insects and animals. The PIL, filed in the Supreme Court by a Tehri Garhwal-based advocate, stated that carbon dioxide emitted from the fires was causing heat in the hills resulting in a faster meltdown of glaciers, besides causing pollution and ecological imbalance. The PIL sought urgent steps to protect/safeguard the forests, wildlife and birds from the forest fires in Uttarakhand and also efforts to ensure the right to a healthy environment. Since the beginning of this year, Uttarakhand has reported 1,130 forest fire incidents that have damaged around 1,540 hectares of forest land. Till Monday evening, there were over 85 forest fires raging in the state’s hill districts, that damaged over 165 acres of forest land in the previous 24 hours. Of the 1,130 forest fire incidents reported, the maximum (269) were reported in Pauri Garhwal, followed by 116 in Tehri, 100 in Bageshwar, 94 in Pithoragarh, 93 in Almora, data provided by the state forest department states. From 2000 to April 5 this year, the hill state has lost 49,231 hectares of forest land to forest fires. Forest fire activity is generally reported from February to June, with a peak in fire incidence in May and June. Besides man-made, other reasons for forest fires in the state include lightning, friction from falling rocks, among others.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/uttarakhand-hc-takes-suo-moto-cognisance-of-alarming-forest-fires-101617726680898.html

As Covid cases have been spiking in Pune, the consumption of liquid oxygen has also increased from 55 metric tonnes per day, to 250 metric tonnes per day. Pune divisional commissioner Saurabh Rao said that the availability of liquid oxygen is not a problem. He also stated that 12,000 Remdesivir injections will be available by Wednesday. “We have got sufficient stock of liquid oxygen with us. The oxygen production capacity in Pune is 325 metric tonnes per day. Right now we are consuming around 250 metric tonnes per day. In January our consumption was as low as 55 metric tonnes per day,” Rao said. Rao said that if a shortage of oxygen is noticed, then the administration has a plan B in place. “If daily production and consumption are almost the same, then we have a plan B in place, by which, industrial production of oxygen will be reduced and it will be dedicated for medical purposes. Last year we had started importing oxygen from Raigad. If needed, we will do the same. Presently, there is no oxygen crisis,” Rao said. As for complaints of a scarcity of Remdesivir, Rao said that more stock of the injections will be available by Wednesday. “There are many private hospitals which are complaining about the availability of Remedivisir. We have instructed all hospitals about hoarding of Remdesivir and judicious use of the same. We requested 12,000 injections from the joint director, FDA, on Tuesday.

In addition to the restriction on movement, vaccination bars beneficiaries from donating blood for at least two months, which further slims the chances of people aged above 45 years from donating blood. Blood banks are now running dry.Dr Atul Kulkarni, director of Jankalyan Raktapedi, a blood bank in the city, said, “As of now we have 500 units of blood available with us which is enough for a week’s time, as we get demands for at least 80-90 units a day. We fear that in the coming days, we might have an acute shortage of blood, especially because of the existing lockdown and restrictions in place. All pre-planned blood donation camps have been postponed indefinitely, or cancelled. We get requests from thalassemic patients who need blood transfusion regularly, and also from emergency surgeries which cannot be delayed.”A senior doctor from Sassoon hospital said, “We are facing an acute shortage of blood. We have 150 units of blood currently and we need 45 donors every alternate day to sustain the current demand; 30-45 units of plasma and 20-40 units of platelets. Blood donation camps which were organised for the weekends have been cancelled due to the lockdown. If any society comes forward they can contact us and we will send our volunteers to collect blood. We have our vans which could be set up in any free space and two people can donate blood at a time.”Explaining the drop, the doctor said, “The surge in cases means more people are being infected who cannot donate blood right now. Also, the high number of people getting the vaccines is also a roadblock, because as per government guidelines a vaccinated person cannot donate blood for at least a month after the jab. So the eligibility criteria is further narrowed.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/city-hospitals-report-acute-shortage-of-blood-with-restrictions-vaccinations-affecting-donors-101617716059253.html

Covid-19 cases in the state are increasing due to these people,” said Thackeray. “There is no tab on migrants coming and going and due to these people, Maharashtrians have to face the brunt in form of the lockdown and sit at home,” he added.Maharashtra has witnessed a rapid surge in its Covid-19 cases over the last few days. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Sunday announced a weekend lockdown and night curfew during the weekdays from Monday to April 30, besides other measures to curb the spread of infection. As per Union health secretary Rajeh Bhushan, Mumbai is among the 10 districts in the country with the highest number of new Covid-19 cases while Maharashtra is among states of maximum concern.Thackeray said that during the previous lockdown, when there was a massive outflow of migrants to their native states, he had suggested they be registered and tested on their return to Maharashtra.“Both my suggestions were ignored. Today it’s Corona, tomorrow it could be some other virus. This chain is not going to stop,” he added.For over a decade, Thackeray is known for his tough stance on migrants, blaming them for eating up the employment opportunities of the local Maharashtrians. This paid him rich dividends in the 2009 assembly polls but then MNS’s performance slid massively during the 2014 and 2019 polls.Also read: Maharashtra BJP chief says one more MVA minister will resign in 8 daysFormer Mumbai Congress chief Sanjay Nirupam said Thackeray should stop indulging in such parochial politics. “In this time of the pandemic, Raj Thackeray should understand the gravity of the situation and not indulge in such cheap gimmicks,” said Nirupam.Thackeray, during his media interaction, also gave details of his zoom meeting with his cousin and Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray. He asked the chief minister to allow retail shops to open at least twice a week, penalise hospital that are refusing beds to Covid-19 patients and give relief in case of electricity bills.Thackeray also demanded the cancellation of 10 and 12 standard exams and promotion of all these students to the next class.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtrians-face-the-brunt-raj-thackeray-blames-migrants-for-covid-19-surge-101617714440184.html

06-04-2021||Mumbai||Animal cruelty cases rose in Mumbai since lockdown, claim activists||On March 28, a man was captured on CCTV at Naya Nagar in Goregaon west molesting a stray dog; however, no police case was registered. On March 11, a serial dog rapist was arrested by the DN Nagar police for raping at least eight female dogs only after the video of the crime was submitted to the police. On March 4, a five year old community dog was beaten to death by a few locals at Chandivali, following which, an FIR was registered at the Sakinaka police station under Section 429 (mischief by killing, poisoning, maiming or rendering useless an animal) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) but no arrests were made, in spite of a recorded video of the violent act. On October 20, 2020, a nine year old female dog was raped, brutally injured by pushing a wooden stick in her private part and left to die near Galleria mall at Hiranandani Gardens in Powai. The police registered a case of rape and attempt to murder against an unidentified man who is still at large. These are just a few instances reported to the police where people have acted worse than the animals during the post lockdown period - starting from April 2020. According to animal activists and NGO workers, the number of animal abuse cases has increased drastically and at an alarming rate post lockdown. Vijay Mohnani, of the NGO Bombay Animal Rights and the Bombay Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (BSPCA), said the frustration of losing jobs and inflation is also one of the reasons for incidents of animal abuse doubling in 2021 compared to 2019 and 2018. Data collected by the NGOs reveals that in the first two months of 2021, at least 8 animal abuse cases were registered in Mumbai every day, as compared to 3 or 4 cases in 2019. Last year, despite the lockdown, 886 cases were registered, with maximum cases registered after September 2020. Out of the 480 cases recorded in the first two months this year, 266 were accidents and hit and run cases, while the rest were brutal murders, rapes, assaults and harassment like starving the animal or death due to abandonment. “Before the lockdown we used to get around 2 to 3 complaints of hit and run and accident cases of stray animals but after the lockdown these numbers have increased to 7 to 8 cases in a day across the city,” said Mohnani. Police and activists say some men consider it a sport to harm and abuse defenceless animals by beating, kicking, torturing, throwing acid or boiling water, amputating part of the body, attacking with a knife or a blunt object. Lata Parmar, Mumbai unit head of the People For Animals (PFA) said since the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) doesn’t keep animal violence data, it becomes difficult for the government and police to gauge the problem. “This data is collected by the reports that reach us but there are so many cases that go unreported,” said Parmar. BJP Member of Parliament and animal rights activist, Maneka Gandhi, who was also the chairperson of PFA, advocated for stricter punishment and penalties for offenders. Parmar said insensitivity towards animals and ignorance of law are the main causes of animal abuse cases. “Many do not know the law and others do not care as punishment for injuring an animal is rare, which makes them fearless,” said Parmar. Police officers said no separate data on victimised animals was available. From 2010 to 2020 nearly 20,000 cases have been recorded by the police with the help of NGOs and activists but just a few arrests have been made. “We register a case and investigate it and even make arrests,” said Navinchadra Reddy, deputy commissioner of police (zone 10). The Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960 punishes all kinds of crimes against animals but the fine ranges between just ₹10 to ₹100. Moreover crimes against animals are put on the back burner by the police. “This is proof that crimes against animals are not taken seriously,” said Dr Radha Chaudhary, a veterinary. Increasing cases and lengthy and costly procedures to register a police complaint was taking a toll on the activists now. Mohnani stated that there was just one government run hospital for animals in Mumbai but it was not free and the person who reports the crime is handed over the bill for treatment of the injured or abused animal. Mohnani said that once a rescuer spots an injured animal, he immediately calls the BMC helpline which is not answered. If the rescuer gets hold of an official, he is asked to contact the nearest NGO or a veterinary doctor. The rescuer then has to pay for the ambulance to get the animal to the hospital in Parel or elsewhere. If the animal survives, the rescuer is asked to pay for its treatment or if it dies he has to pay for the last rites. He then has to spend time and money at the police station to register a complaint. “It’s expensive and time consuming, so these days if the animal survives, we avoid filing an FIR due to which many crimes are not registered with the police,” said Mohnani. During the lockdown, activists had to fight with several residential societies to allow pet owners to take them outside for their daily walks, “Animals do not understand lockdown, they need to relieve themselves but many residential societies banned the owners to do so. We had to register many police complaints for harassment to animals,” said Mohnani. WHAT THE LAW SAYSSection 11 of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act makes all animal cruelties a criminal offence. Fines and imprisonment are both provided for. The Indian Penal Code has similar provisions. Under Section 506 of the IPC, it is a crime to threaten, abuse or harass neighbours who feed animals.IPC Section 428 and 429 prescribe severe punishment of up to five years imprisonment to people resorting to dislocation, abduction and acts of cruelty towards community animals or pets and in such cases the police can arrest any offender without a warrant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/animal-cruelty-cases-rose-in-mumbai-since-lockdown-claim-activists-101617712280585.html
06-04-2021||Dehradun||Uttarakhand forest minister posts a video fighting forest fire; slammed||Amid the raging forest fire in Uttarakhand which has affected over 1300 hectares of area, state forest and wildlife minister Harak Singh Rawat has drawn flak over a video, in which he and his aide are seen trying to douse a forest fire with what appeared to be a shrub or a stem.The Congress and Aam Aadmi Party said the video and stills shared on social media by the minister’s close aides were “mere publicity stunt”.“When the forest fire was raging, then the forest minister was nowhere to be seen. But now, when the choppers of the Indian Air Force (IAF) have arrived to fight the situation, he has now come up with a publicity stunt,” said Congress state president Pritam Singh, who earlier said the BJP led state government was “doing nothing” to control the forest fire.“Forests are Uttarakhand’s most precious assets after the Himalayas. And the lethargic response of the minister to such a serious situation shows this government doesn’t care about the forest of our state,” Singh said.Earlier on Monday, two Mi-17 helicopters reached Uttarakhand to help in fighting the forest fires which have so far affected about 1,300 hectares of forest area and claimed four human lives. Currently over 85 forest fires are raging in hill districts. This year since January 1, the state has reported 1,130 forest fire incidents, in which 1540 hectares of forest land has been damaged. Of these 1,130 forest fire incidents, the maximum 269 have been reported in Pauri Garhwal, followed by 116 in Tehri, 100 in Bageshwar, 94 in Pithoragarh, 93 in Almora, according to the data provided by the state forest department. Since 2000 to April 4 this year, the hill state has lost 49,231 hectares of forest land to forest fires.“When the people were sharing videos and photographs of the forest fire incidents on social media, urging the government to take note of the situation urgently, the minister didn’t pay any heed. Now, instead of taking concrete steps to control it and prevent it in future, he decides to come up with this ridiculous video just for publicity,” said Amarjit Singh, spokesperson of Aam Aadmi Party in Uttarakhand.Minister Rawat however, couldn’t be contacted for a comment till the filing of the story.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/uttarakhand-forest-minister-posts-video-fighting-forest-fire-with-twigs-slammed-101617711799524.html

She sought the permission of the court to withdraw the petition and all other pending litigations. The court, while allowing the request, has kept the petition for consideration on Wednesday. The woman had alleged that Soren was involved in an accident she met with in August 2020. The division bench of justices SS Shinde and Manish Pitale was hearing two intervention applications filed by Jharkhand-based former journalist Sunil Kumar Tiwari and NGO Stree Roshni Trust, who sought an order from the court to not permit the woman to withdraw her petition. The bench was informed by public prosecutor Deepak Thakare that the applicants had no locus standi as the woman had sought to withdraw her petitions and the applications were filed with political interest. Also Read | Soren approves proposal to drop Pathalgadi casesThakare further informed the bench that in 2013 the woman had filed a complaint before the magistrate???s court seeking to lodge a rape case against Soren but had withdrawn the complaint the same year. The plea before the bench now pertained to an accident she had met with in August 2020 in which she suspected Soren???s involvement; however, she now sought to withdraw that plea too. Senior counsel Aabad Ponda, representing the woman, submitted that the woman should not be forced to continue with the petition and she had no connection to the intervenors, and they seemed to be backed by a political party. In view of ???peculiar facts and circumstances of the case???, the court sought to interact with the petitioner in the chamber. In its order, the court noted that the woman appeared before the bench in the chamber and was identified by her advocate. The court also noted that ???she desires to withdraw the writ petition and she does not wish to pursue the allegations made in the plea and the statement was made voluntarily, without any pressure from either of parties.???||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/woman-seeking-fir-against-jharkhand-cm-in-bombay-hc-withdraws-petition-101617711259585.html

They still fear being sent to a Covid care centre for isolation and the family members also being quarantined,” said Dr Omkar Inamdar, Talera Hospital.Every day in two or three areas testing camps are organised between 10am and 3pm.On Sunday, one such camp was organised in Bijilinagar, Chinchwad, which has a population of 5,000-6,000 people and only 31 people came forward for the swab test.On Tuesday, a camp was conducted at Tanajinagar, Chinchwad, where in the first three hours, 31 residents came up for testing. “We feel more people should turn out for the camps. Even after one year, people have various myths regarding testing. We give one day prior information about the camp and all the corporators are spreading the messages in the locality,” said Dr Inamdar.The PCMC administration has decided to conduct more camps in market areas and shop complexes.Currently in PCMC there are 280 major, and 1,684 micro containment zones.“People should come forward and take advantage of all facilities which the administration is providing. They should stop believing in rumors about tests and vaccination. The chain of virus will be only broken if we come together and fight it,” said Pavan Salve, additional health and medical officer, PCMC.PCMC launches 24x7 helpline numbersBed management: 020-67331151; 02067331152The number has 10 lines and six staff members will be working on a shift basis.Doctor’s helpline: 020-67331142; 020-6733114110 doctors are hired to answer any Covid-related queries.

06-04-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra BJP chief says one more MVA minister will resign in 8 days||With its morale boosted after two Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) ministers resigned in the last 35 days, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has decided to up the ante against the government. Maharashtra BJP chief Chandrakant Patil said that one more minister from the state government will resign in the next eight days.Speaking in Pune on the occasion of the BJP’s 41st foundation day, Patil said that there are at least seven ministers with criminal records in the MVA government. He said that the ministers’ offences are very serious in nature and claimed that the state government will fall on its own.“There are 6-7 ministers in the state cabinet who are facing serious criminal charges. One of the ministers is facing imprisonment for beating up a policeman, while another has recently revealed his relationship outside wedlock. One of the ministers’ son-in-law is in jail in connection with a drug case, while another is facing charges of beating a party worker. We are not interested in taking the resignation of any minister, but it is going to happen naturally. Like in cricket, the first few wickets bat for a longer time, but the tail-enders fall quickly. Similarly, the next resignations from MVA ministers will come at shorter intervals,” he said.Also Read | Patil starts stint as Maharashtra home minister with a promise and appeal in SCPatil said that while the list of wrongdoings of some ministers from the MVA government has already been in the public domain, a few more names will be added to it in the next few days. “The MVA government will collapse under its own deeds. There is no need to put in special efforts to topple it. The BJP will fight the elections on its own and form the government without joining hands with any other party,” Patil said.On Monday, leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis said that a few more names will come to light for their involvement in the “extortion” case during the CBI investigation. “There are few more names that will be exposed in the course of investigation of the case. The alleged involvement of the home minister is just the tip of the iceberg. I believe many heavyweights from the ruling parties are involved in the entire case of ‘extortion’,” he said.According to the BJP leaders, the state unit has decided to go become more aggressive against the MVA government over issues such as corruption and lockdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-bjp-chief-says-one-more-mva-minister-will-resign-in-8-days-101617710299610.html
06-04-2021||Bangalore||Karnataka govt rules out negotiations with RTC workers, warns against strike||With the employees of road transport corporations set to go on a strike on wage related issues from April 7, the Karnataka government on Tuesday warned of strict action and ruled out any negotiations with them.Noting that most of the demands made by the employees have been addressed despite financial constraints due to Covid-19, the government made it clear that their demand for implementation of the sixth pay commission report for the Road Transport Corporation workers cannot be fulfilled.The government has also made alternate arrangements by roping in private transport operators aimed at addressing inconvenience caused to the public, due to the strike, officials said."Transport employees have given a call to go on strike from tomorrow, the Chief Minister held a discussion in this regard, we are requesting employees not to go on strike keeping Covid-19 situation in mind.They had nine demands, eight of them have been fulfilled and implemented," Chief Secretary P Ravi Kumar said.Addressing reporters after meeting with the Chief Minister, he said their demand for implementation of the sixth pay commission report, and thereby give them the salary on par with the government employees, cannot be accepted."It cannot be given to transport employees," he said, however, the transport minister after discussion has agreed for an 8 per cent increase in salary as an interim relief, but it cannot be implemented immediately as the model code of conduct is in place and a letter has been sent to the Election Commission seeking permission.Workers of Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC), Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC), North Western Karnataka Road Transport Corporation (NWKRTC) and North Eastern Karnataka Road Transport Corporation (NEKRTC), under the banner of Karnataka State Road Transport Employees League have given a call for strike from April 7.The protest is against the governments failure to implement a salary under the 6th Pay Commission for the RTC workers.Observing that so far pay revision used to take place for transport employees once in four years after discussion with them, Kumar claimed that for government employees pay commission implementation takes place after five or six years, some time 10 years also.Due to Covid-19 situation, lockdown and decline in number of passengers the transport corporations had no proper income and yet the state government ensured payment for staff on time, by spending ₹2,100 crore, he said.Pointing out that the Transport Minister and the Chief Minister have made an appeal, as the strike will cause problems for the public, the Chief Secretary said to address the situation the transport department will take measures."Private buses, maxi cabs will be left free, they will be allowed to operate in assigned routes.The Transport Commissioner is working on alternate arrangements across the state," he said.But still there will be some inconvenience, also Railways have been requested for special trains to places like Kalaburagi, Belagavi, Hubballi, Mysuru among others.The CM directed us to deal with the transport strike "strictly", Kumar in response to a question said.The government is mulling imposing Essential Services Maintenance Act (ESMA)."There will be no more negotiations or talks... still if they go for strike, all the measures that can be taken in the framework of law will be taken.This is the strict decision taken by the CM and it will be implemented... no work no pay will any ways be there," he said.Warning the employees against damage to buses and public assets in the name of strike, he said such things will be dealt with very seriously.Citing Covid-19 restrictions in place and a notification already issued under the Disaster Management Act stating that people cannot gather in groups, Kumar said if it is violated, action will be taken.Highlighting the situation faced by public transport corporations, he said 45 lakh passengers used to commute in public transport buses in Bengaluru alone per day, which has now reduced to 20 lakh, and may further go down due to COVID."Public transport corporations are facing ₹4 crore loss per day, the government is filling in for it," he said.Making it clear that action will be initiated against those involved in any kind of instigation, the Chief Secretary said the transport commissioner will take steps to ensure that autos and cabs don't charge exorbitantly, taking advantage of transport strike.The Transport Commissioner said notification fixing cab and bus fares has already been issued and no once can charge over it."If we get to know about it, strict action will be taken."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/karnataka-govt-rules-out-negotiations-with-rtc-workers-warns-against-strike-101617706851678.html
06-04-2021||Pune||Civic Sanskriti: Life on a finite planet||We are entering the 50th year since the 1972 United Nations Conference on the Environment in Stockholm, which was the first global conference to make the environment a major issue. It was also in 1972, that a group of young researchers at MIT, USA, presented their report called “Limits to Growth”, with the key message that unlimited economic growth on a finite planet is impossible. Over the last few decades, questions have been asked in relation to that message, and especially with greater understanding of climate change and globalisation: who is growing - is it transnational corporations? What does “growth” mean – is it the well-being of people, or do we mean GDP growth, even counting pollution clean-up as growth? What is the impact of economic growth on people and the environment – does it lead to a better life for all, or profits for some and poverty for many?Economic growth, especially in the last 50 years, has certainly led to increasing carbon emissions, and the prospect of dangerous climate change. We only have about a decade to get our act right.While India seems on track with renewable energy targets, the new discussion is: can India set itself more ambitious targets of carbon emission reduction?While the average carbon footprint per person in India is not high, globally, we still have the third largest collective footprint as a country. Growth in food, education, healthcare, infrastructure, has led to many gains over the past few decades. But, now we need to check our growing carbon footprint.The Climate Collective Pune (https://www.climatecollectivepune.org/) formed by a few like-minded individuals in 2018 has been deliberating upon the idea of carbon neutrality.Suggestions submitted to the environment minister include: very large increases in distributed solar power, including rooftop systems for domestic use; improving energy management and doing away with diesel gen-sets; complete (or maximal) shift to electric vehicles; and extensive ecological restoration and greening to sequester carbon.The Energy Conservation Building Code (ECBC), developed by the Bureau of Energy Efficiency, has provisions for how to make buildings more energy efficient. Andhra Pradesh and Telangana have already adopted it. MEDA and the Urban Development Department have key roles to play. Since electric cars and bikes are still cars and bikes, occupying road space and using energy currently still generated from dirty coal, we do need to change the way we travel. Reducing private motorised modes will improve road safety, make more efficient use of road infrastructure, and make active travel realistic and safer for those who do choose to walk and cycle. Last week, Climate Collective Pune launched Eco Fusion, an e-magazine to reach out to Punekars with ideas for becoming more environmentally responsible and climate resilient. In his article, Dr Chirag Dhara, a scientist with IITM, Pune, suggests that we must go beyond renewables and electric vehicles.We need a close look at growth and consumption such as private vehicles, fashion, junk food, fuelled by planned obsolescence and advertising leading to “manufacturing of desires”! These cause extravagant use of fossil fuels, minerals, fresh water which are in limited supply. Chirag suggests that we must engage with the idea of “de-growth”, and aim for a conscious change from profligate consumption.Ashish Kothari, a founder member of Kalpavriksh, suggests we should go further than de-growth, which is an idea emerging in the developed world. We need to listen to “ecological democracy” voices emerging in the grassroots movements in India.The key ideas of ecological democracy pertain to living within ecological limits, as well as with equity. There is no single right answer, but communities may evolve their own local solutions in a convivial way, fostering social justice using direct democracy methods. This itself can make life more meaningful.Alternatives Forum, or Vikalp Sangam (https://vikalpsangam.org/) has been documenting many such inspirational grassroots movements from across India.What is ecological democracy in the urban context, and in the urban-rural-regional context? Could urban movements engage more consciously with and benefit from the ideas of ecological democracy? Is it possible to start at a neighbourhood - or city-scale in Pune?The pandemic has increased economic recession and large-scale distress among urban poor and informal economies. How can we “decarbonise” as well as make life better, especially for the poor?These are among the most important conversations we must have.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/civic-sanskriti-life-on-a-finite-planet-101617707659617.html

06-04-2021||Pune||Leopard rescued from 40-ft-deep well in Pune district||Mumbai: A male leopard who had fallen into a 40-feet-deep well in Junnar taluka (Pune district) was rescued from drowning after a two-hour-long operation on Monday by non-profit conservation group Wildlife SOS, along with the Maharashtra forest department.Residents in Vadgaon Kandali village alerted the forest department about the incident on Monday, after hearing the animal’s distressed cries. A four-member team of rescuers was immediately dispatched to the spot. The animal was brought to safety after rescuers lowered a trap cage into the well. Those involved in the effort said that the animal, who was struggling to stay afloat in the well, sensed that this was its only chance of survival.After being lifted out of the well, the leopard was transferred to Wildlife SOS’s Leopard Rescue Centre for medical examination. Officials estimated the animal to be about five-year-old, and said that he will be kept under observation at the rescue and rehabilitation centre in Junnar for a few days.Dr Nikhil Bangar, wildlife veterinary officer, Wildlife SOS, said, “While the leopard was struggling to claw its way out of the well, he sustained minor abrasions at the nail region. We will keep the leopard under observation while he recuperates from this stressful ordeal.”Kartick Satyanarayan of Wildlife SOS, said, “The entire exercise had to be executed quickly and with painstaking care. We are grateful to the forest department for making the rescue a success. The startling increasing rate of habitat encroachment has resulted in decreasing prey base, territory and water sources for predator species like leopards that are then forced to come out into human habitation. Since these elusive cats usually prefer to move around at night, it is common for them to fall victim to uncovered wells.”Yogesh Ghodke, regional forest officer, said, “We suspect that the leopard had fallen into the well at night while on the prowl for food. The leopard is currently under temporary observation at the Wildlife SOS centre.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/leopard-rescued-from-40-ft-deep-well-in-pune-district-101617707059999.html
06-04-2021||Bhopal||Covid-19: Madhya Pradesh chief minister says not wearing masks amounts to 'crime'||Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan on Tuesday said not wearing a face mask amounts to crime and appealed to people to follow appropriate "social behaviour" to check the spread of Covid-19.The surge in cases now is due to people lowering their guard, Chouhan said after starting a 24-hour 'sit-in' here to spread the awareness among people about following the Covid-19 prevention guidelines.The CM launched the "Swasthya Agrah" (health request) at the Minto Hall in Bhopal at 12.30 pm on Tuesday and during his 24-hour 'sit-in', he will interact with people online and conduct his official work from the venue."Wearing masks and maintaining social distance are not in our habit. Besides these, we have to take other measures also to control the pandemic. So, I am sitting here for a moral request to make these things a part of people's habit," Chouhan told reporters.He said it is a "crime" if someone is not wearing a mask, because this also affects the health of others around that person.Chouhan said he launched an awareness campaign for wearing masks on Monday."I ensured that me and my family wear masks...the word 'mask' means 'mera aapka suraksha kavach' (my and your safety shield)," he said.The coronavirus cannot be controlled only by government's efforts, because the infection is being spread by (inappropriate) social behaviour, he said."We are making efforts to arrange facilities to fight the pandemic at the government level, but the infection spread has to be stopped by (appropriate) social behaviour," he said.Chouhan said people became complacent when the viral infection was brought under control in the country a few months back due to efforts of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and launch of the vaccination drive."This has again caused the spread. Lockdown is an easy solution, but I don't consider it right. A limited lockdown is ok, but a permanent one is not a solution," he said.The CM said self-discipline is necessary to prevent the spread of the infection, and urged people to wear masks, maintain social distance, wash hands and adopt other precautionary measures.Chouhan said his office will function during his 24- hour sit-in campaign."I will review the Covid-19 situation in the state, talk to leaders of various sections of society and religious leaders on awareness about the disease and also hold a cabinet meeting, besides other works, during this Swasthya Agrah," the chief minister said.Chouhan also said he has urged his party (BJP) workers not to come to the venue of his campaign so as to maintain social distance.The state government is also making efforts to take the help of volunteers, who can register themselves for assistance in the vaccination process, spread awareness about the prevention norms, and help patients in home and institutional quarantine, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/covid19-madhya-pradesh-chief-minister-says-not-wearing-masks-amounts-to-crime-101617704643383.html
06-04-2021||Patna||Senior judge of Patna high court tests Covid positive, admitted to AIIMS-Patna||A senior judge of the Patna high court tested positive for coronavirus and was admitted to the All India Institute of Medical Sciences in Patna late Monday evening, according to hospital documents seen by HT. The judge is learnt to be undergoing conservative treatment for Covid-19.The judge, who was running fever for the last couple of days and tested positive for the infection on Monday, was advised hospitalisation by authorities at AIIMS. His name has been withheld at the request of hospital authorities.Patna high court has decided to hold only online hearing from Tuesday due to the recent spurt in cases. The HC was earlier hearing cases virtually and also in-person.“His vital parameters are stable and the severity of infection is mild at this stage. He does not require oxygen therapy as of now,” a government official who spoke on condition of anonymity said.There was no official word from the hospital. AIIMS-Patna superintendent Dr CM Singh declined comment saying he was busy. Director, AIIMS-Patna, Dr Prabhat Kumar Singh, could not be reached on phone and hospital’s nodal officer for Covid-19, Dr Sanjeev Kumar, did not respond to text messages and phone calls.News of the judge contracting the infection came even as Bihar reported 935 new infections, the highest single-day spike in cases this year.Like several other states witnessing a resurgence of Covid-19 cases in what is being referred to as the second wave of the infection in India, Bihar, too, has seen a spike with 3,422 cases reported after Holi between March 29 and April 4, in comparison to the 224 cases reported during the week ending March 7.State capital Patna has contributed most of the new infections, accounting for 432 of the 935 cases registered on Monday; 372 of the 864 cases on April 4; 359 of the 836 cases on April 3; 287 of the 662 cases on April 2 and 174 of the 488 infections reported in the state on April 1. The AIIMS, Patna has already scaled up the number of beds for Covid-19 patients from 60 to 110. The number of ICU beds for Covid patients have also been increased from 20 to 30 at the institute.Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar is reviewing the Covid-19 situation with health officials on a daily basis.

06-04-2021||Delhi||Pandemic, fund crunch halt Delhi parking policy implementation||Haphazardly parked vehicles on roads and often pavements are a common sight in Delhi. Counted among the cities with poor parking facilities globally, Delhi continues to struggle to streamline its parking management despite a policy in place. Almost two years after the government notified the Delhi Maintenance and Management of Parking Places Rules, 2019, it has been put on the backburner by the three municipal agencies tasked with its implementation. The Covid-19 pandemic, fund crunch, lack of resources, poor enforcement, resistance from market associations have been cited as the reasons for it.Delhi has at least 10 million registered vehicles including 7.9 million two-wheelers and 3.3 million four-wheelers. With 67,50,00 vehicles on an average added to Delhi roads annually, the parking woes continue to grow.As per the policy, civic agencies were to make area-specific Parking Management Area Plans (PMAPs), regulate pricing, identify spaces for overnight parking of commercial vehicles, manage on-street parking and ensure charging facilities for electric vehicles. The South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) started the implementation of the policy in Lajpat Nagar-III on a pilot basis in January 2020. It prepared a PMAP under which lanes were marked for parking and non-parking purposes. Signage was installed to indicate no parking zones, tow-away zones, one-way lanes, and roundabouts. Vehicles of residents were to be provided green stickers while those of visitors red ones.Also Read | Action on old vehicles, traffic congestion in Delhi’s plan against air pollutionSimilar plans were made for Krishna Nagar in East Delhi and Kamla Nagar in North Delhi and implemented under the supervision of the Supreme Court-appointed Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority (EPCA), which was dissolved in October 2020.Officials cited a lack of funds and manpower due to the Covid-19 pandemic among the reasons for the non-implementation of the policy. The three pilot projects were put on hold due to the nationwide lockdown imposed because of the pandemic in March last year. A majority of the civic staff has been deployed on Covid-19 duties after lockdown norms were eased.Prem Shankar Jha, SDMC’s deputy commissioner, remunerative cell, said even after the lockdown was lifted, the progress on the implementation of the policy remained tardy because of lack of funds and resources. “Before Covid-19, we prepared PMAPs for at least 10 residential as well as market areas such as Malviya Nagar, Greater Kailash-2, Aurobindo Place, Janakpuri, Rajouri Garden among others. PMAPs were to be implemented at these places after the Lajpat Nagar-III pilot project but before we could start work, the pandemic struck and priorities changed.”A North Delhi Municipal Corporation official, who did not want to be named, said their priority is to pay salaries of employees and have no funds to implement the parking policy. “Due to Covid-19, the income of the corporation has drastically gone down. We are unable to pay salaries to the staff and they go on strike every now and then to demand pending salaries. We have a Kamla Nagar pedestrianisation plan ready, but we need resources and money for that. After Karol Bagh and Kamla Nagar, we had to prepare PMAPs in Kirti Nagar and Keshav Puram but that is put on hold for some time.”Anuj Malhotra, a transport expert, said the progress of the project was good until it was being monitored by the EPCA. “There used to be review meetings at regular intervals where civic bodies and other concerned departments used to give status reports on the preparation and implementation of PMAPs. But after EPCA was dissolved in October 2020, there was hardly any monitoring of the project,” said Malhotra, who assisted the civic bodies in formulating and implementing PMAPs for Lajpat Nagar, Kamla Nagar and Krishna Nagar.Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director (research and advocacy), Centre for Science and Environment, said the implementation of the policy is a very complex process and unless there is a continuous, consistent and stringent monitoring mechanism, it is very difficult to push this in the right direction. She said the city needs a strong oversight system and therefore it is needed to be put in place as a mechanism for compliance.“The Supreme Court directive was very clear that the authorities will have to do this city-wide after the implementation of the three pilot projects in Lajpat Nagar, Kamla Nagar and Krishna Nagar. Even in pilot areas, things are now back to square one. So, the big message here is that unless you have continuous and stringent monitoring of the implementation, then even the small progress that we are making will get reversed,” Roychowdhury said. “We have no idea what happened to the progress of parking policy after EPCA was dismantled.”Experts also blamed a lack of proper coordination among agencies involved in the project.Roychowdhury called coordination among agencies a must for the success of any such big project. “There are several stakeholders involved in the implementation of the parking policy. So, that is why you need a strong oversight system for that coordination. A holistic approach is needed.”Malhotra suggested a state-level technical coordination committee for the implementation of parking reforms. “Such a committee should consist of senior urban designers, traffic modelling experts. The committee’s main job should be to coordinate among agencies and to review the PMAPs and provide solutions to tackling an area. It should directly report to the urban development minister or chief minister. The committee shall also coordinate between different departments to help implement the PMAPs.”A lack of a skilled technical workforce is seen as another reason for the lack of implementation of the policy. To address the issue, SDMC in September started training its officials, mostly engineers, on the modalities of PMAPs and how to implement them in neighbourhoods. “We have trained some staff in the three civic bodies to prepare and implement PMAPs, but we still need skilled hands,” said Jha.Malhotra said the municipalities should also hire in-house urban planners and urban designers to create PMAPs to meet the parking requirement of neighbourhoods.Roychowdhury said technical knowledge and skill-building is necessary to create technically sound teams to work on the creation and implementation of PMAPs with the help of professionals. She added the municipalities will have to make PMAPs in large numbers and for that, they need to develop a skilled workforce along with professional guidance.Civic authorities re-implemented the pedestrianisation plan on Karol Bagh’s Ajmal Khan Road on April 1 despite traders’ resistance. The emergency lane of the road, which was taken over by vehicles earlier, has since been reserved for walkers and street vendors. At some points, vehicles continued to be parked on the pedestrianised stretch. “We have reimplemented the plan as per the policy. Traders are opposing the move and we are now assessing the situation. We had invested time and money in making Karol Bagh a pedestrian-friendly market so we cannot let it become a chaotic market,” a municipal official said, requesting anonymity.In June 2020, vehicular movement was allowed on pedestrianised stretches in Krishna Nagar, Karol Bagh, and Kamla Nagar markets on the traders’ demand.Aman Rajput, East Delhi Municipal Corporation’s deputy commissioner, said that vehicular movement on the pedestrianised stretches under their jurisdiction continues as the traders are not supportive of the plan. “They say that their business is already down due to the pandemic and the people coming to markets prefer personal vehicles. So, they say that if the pedestrianisation plan is reimplemented, their business will suffer. We have also put on hold the PMPs for Laxmi Nagar and Geeta Colony as we cannot implement such plans without the public’s support.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/pandemic-fund-crunch-halt-delhi-parking-policy-implementation-101617702259248.html

06-04-2021||Delhi||Covid-19 positivity rate in Delhi above 5%: Why it's a matter of concern?||The Delhi government on Tuesday announced night curfew, which will be in place from 10pm to 5am, to check the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in the national capital. The decision has been taken after continuous rise in the number of cases over the past few weeks.But what has been equally worrying for the government is that the positivity rate - a measure of the number of positive cases from those tested - crossed the five per cent mark. This is the threshold that the World Health Organization (WHO) identifies as ideal for an outbreak to be considered as under control.Also Read: Will eateries be open? Delhi night curfew FAQs answeredWith 3,548 cases after 64,003 tests, Delhi's positivity rate jumped to 5.54% on Monday, which is the highest since December 2 last year.Why is this a matter of concern?The positivity rate determines the spread of the infection, and when it goes above the five per cent threshold, experts sound an alarm saying the disease in on its way to become unmanageable.And doctors agree with that. “We have to keep a close eye on the numbers. The increasing positivity rate indicates that the disease is spreading faster," Dr Jugal Kishore, head of the department of community medicine at Delhi's Safdarjung hospital, said when the fresh spike just began in the national capital in March.“There is a laxity in the Covid-19 norms in Delhi now... This needs to change,” he added.How has Delhi fared in terms of positivity rate?On March 15, 368 cases were reported in Delhi, which showed a positivity rate of 0.6%. This is when Delhi health minister Satyendra Jain said the national capital is at a benchmark of Covid-19 cases. "In Maharashtra, the positivity rate is 16 per cent, Gujarat's positivity rate is three times of Delhi. The positivity rate has reached six times in Punjab, seven times in Kerala and 30 times in Maharashtra," Jain said on March 15.Since then, the rate has been on an upward trajectory. In week starting March 22, new cases grew to 888 while the positivity rate inched up to 1.3%.On March 29, the day of Holi, the positivity rate rose to 2.7%. That day, 1,904 cases were recorded.In the week since Holi, the positivity rate rose exactly by double to reach 5.5%.What the Delhi government is doing?"The case positivity rate was 4.64 per cent on Sunday. Random tests are being done at a fast pace and capacity is being ramped up. More than 80,000 tests are being conducted a day which is five times more than the national average," Delhi health minister Satyendra Jain told reporters on Monday.The Kejriwal government is taking a number of other decisions to contain the contagion, the minister said, adding that micro-containment zones are being created wherever two to three Covid-19 cases are detected.What are the positivity rates in other states?In Maharashtra, the worst-hit state, the positivity rate stands at 14.6 per cent. Out of the 2,07,15,793 laboratory samples, which were taken until today, 30,57,885 have tested positive for Covid-19, the state government's health department showed.Punjab, another badly affected state, has seen its positivity rate grow at a fast pace. According to Punjab health minister Balbir Singh Sidhu, a positivity rate of 2.9% was recorded from February 27 to March 5, which increased to 7.9% between March 27 to April 2.Also Read: List of restrictions in other statesIn Chhattisgarh, among the states where the Centre has sent its teams to help tackle the spread of the disease, the positivity rate stands at 20%., Union health minister Harsh Vardhan said on Tuesday. The state's health minister TS Singh Deo said on Saturday that the positivity rate is not as high as compared to September last year. "In September, the maximum daily cases recorded was 3,900 from about 27,000 tests. The present number of daily cases on Thursday is from 40,000 tests. So the positivity per cent is less as compared to that in September," Deo told news agency ANI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/covid19-positivity-rate-in-delhi-above-5-why-it-s-a-matter-of-concern-101617701604270.html

06-04-2021||Chandigarh||Himachal fighting forest fires after prolonged dry spell||The prolonged dry spell this year has sparked off fires in the chir pine forests of the lower hills of Himachal Pradesh with 845 such incidents reported in April in Shimla, Solan, Mandi, Sirmaur, Bilaspur, Kangra and Hamirpur districts. The raging fire, which causes extensive damage to flora and fauna, has the forest department on its toes. In the past two months, more than 8,455.2 hectares of forest land has been destroyed due to the fire. Himachal Pradesh frequently witnesses forest fires during the dry weather as pines shed resinous needles that are inflammable. February recorded a rain deficit of 82% and March witnessed a deficit of 62%. “Two months have been dry, and the incidents of forest fires have increased as there is less moisture on the ground and temperatures have begun rising,” state forest minister Rakesh Pathania said. “We have roped in the fire department but dousing the blaze in the remote areas, particularly those inaccessible by road, is a challenge. The forest department is trying to rope in local people,” he said. Human negligence sparks off blaze Forest officials say that most fire incidents are started by human negligence as it’s been noticed that they start in and around habitations. More than a dozen such incidents have been reported from areas surrounding Shimla so far this year. The smoke blanket has become a health hazard for residents and environmentalists have sought a solution to the recurring problem. Sanjay Chauhan, a former mayor of Shimla, says, “One such fire is raging in the Junga Forest Range, 25km from Shimla. It’s visible from the Secretariat for the past four days but neither the forest department nor any other department has showed seriousness in dousing it. This forest adjoining Kufri wildlife sanctuary that surrounds Shimla is one of the biggest green covers and the catchment area for water sources of Koti and Brandi. The government should wake up and proactively protect forests.” Replace chir pine with broadleafed trees Environmentalists have suggested framing a forest composition policy and replacing the inflammable chir pine with broadleafed trees in the lower hills. “We see a similar scenario every other year but refuse to face the real issue of replacing the chir pine monocultures that are vulnerable to fire. Until there is policy and the chir is replaced, this problem will persist. It is not the responsibility of the forest department alone. Local communities are custodians living around forests,” says environmentalist Manshi Asher. She suggests creating forest protection committees that can take on this task with the support of the forest department. Fire watchers to aerial surveys to check spread Official data shows that 2018 was the worst year of forest fires with 2,469 incidents reported. It was the highest in eight years in which nearly 25,300 hectares of forest land in the state was burnt. In 2012-13, the second worst year, pine forests over 20,773 hectares were destroyed with a total of 1,798 fires reported. The state forest department has drawn up a policy for converting the chir pine waste into combustible bricks. Besides, it has deployed 6,000 members of the forest staff as fire watchers for the timely dousing of flames. It now plans to conduct aerial surveys to take stock of the situation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/himachal-fighting-forest-fires-after-prolonged-dry-spell-101617693978424.html

It will be in force till April 30 or until further orders. The order, however, states that those working in private companies and engaged in essential services will have to get an e-pass for travelling within the city. The e-pass can be a hard or a soft copy which can be obtained by applying on the website www.delhi.gov.in, it stated. Besides, e-passes will also be required for those travelling for Covid-19 vaccination. “The concerned district magistrates shall be responsible for issuance of e-passes for above activities and for overall implementation of these measures in their respective jurisdiction concerned,” read the order.

Consequently, the test positivity rate inched above 5%, the threshold that the World Health Organization identifies as ideal for an outbreak to be considered as under control. Night curfews are one of the most common non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) used in other states as well. These include districts in Punjab, Rajasthan and Gujarat. The strictest of the measures are in Maharashtra, where authorities imposed a night and weekend curfew, ordered non-essentials businesses to shut down, and asked most offices to switch to remote working.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/starting-today-night-curfew-in-delhi-from-10pm-to-5am-amid-rising-covid-cases-101617692058300.html
06-04-2021||Patna||Bihar pollution board seeks check on air pollution amid Covid-19 surge||With the air quality index (AQI) in Patna and other cities remaining in the range between poor to hazardous, the Bihar State Pollution Control Board (BSPCB) has reiterated the need for government agencies’ help to curb toxic emissions and release of particles suspended in the air. In view of the rise in coronavirus cases, said to worsen and spread rapidly when the air quality is poor, BSPCB chairman Ashok Ghosh said the board will again sent letters to all the concerned departments, such as road construction, building construction, road and urban development seeking strict adherence to the clean air action plan and steps to check contamination of air. Nearly 800-1000 Covid-19 positive cases are being reported in Bihar after the resurgence of the disease in the past few days. Citing the recent study on factors for ambient air pollution, Ghosh said that neighbourhood or outside boundary sources were the major contributors for deterioration in AQI in Patna. “Domestic pollution, which is mainly caused due to biomass burning, is another major issue that the government should step in to address,” added the chairman. He said department of transport and industries were no longer contributing to the worsening AQI. “The Board has embarked up on a major drive to install state of the art air quality monitoring stations across the state to know the source of pollutants and take corrective steps to check them at the source,” said Ghosh. Chief executive officer of the Centre for Environment and Energy Development (CEED) Ramapati Kumar said that the prevailing scenario necessitated framing of city-based micro level planning to ensure smooth implementation of the clean air action plan. “The district level officers should be sensitised about strategy and implementation process of the plan. Apart from this, the government shall act on achieving low-hanging fruits such as replacing solid fuel with cleaner sources,” said Kumar. After strengthening the network to monitor AQI in Patna, the BSPCB has initiated steps to install air quality monitoring stations in 24 districts, besides Patna, Gaya, Muzaffarpur and Vaishali, this year. The board earlier proposed to set up air quality monitoring stations in all 38 districts, but availability of fund from both the Centre and the state government, restricted the plan to 24 districts of Valmikinagar, Siwan, Chapra, Buxar, Ara, Sasaram, Motihari, Bettiah, Muzaffapur, Aurangabad, Gaya, Rajgir, Begusarai, Bihar Sharif, Samastipur, Darbhanga, Muger, Saharsa, Bhagalpur, Katihar, Purnia, Araria and Kishanganj.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-pollution-board-seeks-check-on-air-pollution-amid-covid-19-surge-101617691998531.html

A group of 35 people were reported to have opened fire on rivals, mostly from one family, on Holi day. Apart from three brothers, one sub-inspector of the Border Security Force (BSF), who had returned home on leave, was killed. The mafia style execution in day light invited sharp reactions from even BJP leaders, including ministers in Kumar’s cabinet, with one leader calling it a “massacre” and alleging that police laxity was to be blamed for letting the strife fester.The CM said he had been briefed more than five times, including twice on Monday, on the investigations in the case, by the director general of police (DGP) S K Singhal. Nitish Kumar added that the probe will be expedited and the guilty once arrested will go through a quick trial.Kumar said the opposition’s remarks against him and his government were made for the sake of publicity. “Those who want publicity start speaking against me. They don’t have any work,” he said, and added that people were aware of the work done by his government.On Monday night, opposition leader Tejashwi Yadav tweeted to accuse Nitish Kumar of not showing any sympathy for the victims and announced that he will visit the family of the victims on Tuesday.“I will visit victims of the Madhubani massacre tomorrow. Forget about meeting the victims of this massacre, Nitish ji hasn’t even condoled the killings till now. Arrest of any noted criminal was also not done since the killings were carried out under the protection of his MLA and government,” Tejashwi tweeted.Darbhanga range inspector general of police (IGP) Ajitabh Kumar told HT that Madhubani killings were part of a war for supremacy between two groups. “A case has been lodged against 35 persons and dozens of unidentified accused. Eleven of the named accused have been arrested and jailed, while the administration has attached the properties of the two main accused—Pravin Jha and Navin Jha, who are still absconding,” said the IG, adding that proclamation notices have been put up at the houses of 10-accused in the case.A special investigation team (SIT) under the supervision of Madhubani superintendent of police (SP) Dr Satya Prakash has been constituted to arrest all the accused.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/nitish-kumar-vows-to-spare-no-one-in-madhubani-killings-as-criticism-mounts-101617689298089.html

It asked for modification of the court’s March 9 order, by which the three MCDs were ordered to clear salary, arrear and pension dues by April 5.“The right of the employees to salaries is a fundamental and non-payment directly impinges on their right to life and liberty,” said the court while dismissing the argument of the civic body on the fund crunch.Advocate Divya Prakash Pande, representing the north civic body, had submitted that one of the reasons of the fund crunch was non-payment of dues by the Delhi government.According to the civic body’s application, it has approximately 57,202 employees (including both permanent and daily wage workers) and approximately 24,853 pensioners.The court also pulled up the Delhi government.“You cannot shrug off your responsibility.

06-04-2021||Dehradun||Lack of strategy impedes fight against forest fires||At least 85 forest fires are raging in Uttarakhand, and have destroyed 165 acres of land in the past 24 hours to 48 hours, forcing the state to seek the Centre’s intervention — two helicopters of the Indian Air Force were pressed into service Monday, and they flew several sorties to spray water over the fires — even as it became clear that the state, with a forest cover of 71% of its area, still does not have an effective strategy to deal with forest fires.Since 2000 to April 4 this year, the hill state has lost 49,231 hectares of forest land to forest fires. And, the first few days of April 2021 has seen the worst forest fires in the past one decade with the state government grappling to control the damage.Major forest fires are raging in at least 40 places in the state even as chief minister Tirath Singh Rawat said that around 12,000 forest workers were deployed and 1,300 fire crew stations were set up to douse the flames, which have so far claimed six lives and led to death of several animals.Forest department officials on Monday said that the fires were spreading to new areas because of the hot weather conditions and strong winds. According to India Meteorological Department, Uttarakhand has received 70% less rainfall than normal in March and there has not been a single rainy day in April, thereby providing perfect dry conditions for the fire to spread.Since January, the state has reported 1,130 forest fire incidents, which in total ravaged 1,540 hectares of forest land, the highest since all of 2018.On Sunday, in an emergency meeting, Rawat admitted the need for a long-term plan to check fires. He directed the officials to seek the help of van panchayats and local people in checking forest fires, and set up fire control rooms and fire stations at tehsil and block levels.At the ground level, when a forest fire occurs, there are three ways in which it can be doused. Using water, soil, or beating the forest fire with branches. As water is not available on hill slopes where forests catch fire and it is not practical or even possible to collect soil, the only way available to locals and forest officials is to beat the advancing forest fires with tree branches.But when the forest fires are raging, such methods are not of much help. There are also fire lines or spaces created in forests, which helps to check the spread of fires. But given the huge area under forests in the state, such lines also prove ineffective in most cases. Uttarakhand has a forest area of over 38,000 sq km, which constitutes 71% of the total geographical area of the state.Experts say the only effective way to deal with forest fires is getting locals involved to ensure that: one, such fires aren’t man-made; and two, when fires start, enough people are mobilised to fight them.But for that, the locals need to be made aware of how they will benefit.Ajay Singh Rawat, an environmentalist, said dousing forest fires should be a people’s movement and such fires should be declared as a national disaster.Maan Singh, nodal officer for forest fires in the state forest department, said that the real issue isn’t strategy but the enormity of the challenge.“The main challenge in hilly areas is how to douse the fire when no water is available. So, most locals try to check the advance of forest fires by beating it with big branches. We also go for routine cleaning of the forest lines. But as forests are huge, we don’t know where the fires will start,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/lack-of-strategy-impedes-fight-against-forest-fires-101617667207469.html

Within seconds, the whole area was covered in dust. “At first, we thought an explosion had taken place,” said Jaspreet Singh, the owner of a factory located next to the four-storeyed auto parts factory, the roof of which collapsed on Monday morning when labourers were trying to lift its ceiling. “I rushed out and saw the whole area engulfed in dust and a sense of chaos all around,” he added. Jaspreet, along with the workers and owners of nearby factories, were the first ones to initiate rescue operations before the police and fire department teams reached the spot.“A few labourers managed to come out of the debris on their own while some were rescued by locals. A few minutes later, the fire brigade and police reached the spot and started shifting the injured to hospitals,” said Jaspreet.He added that it was fortunate that the factory where the mishap took place was closed for a day or else the casualties would have been higher. Labourers Ranjit Kumar, Sarwan and Sanjiv Kumar said they work in the factory next to the ill-fated building. After hearing the thud, they rushed out of the factory assuming that something heavy had come crashing down the sky. “When we came out, we heard the labourers trapped in the building crying for help. We rushed to the terrace and rescued some of them,” said Ranjit Kumar.Sanjiv Kumar said they arranged water for the rescued labourers and informed the police.Kanwaldeep Singh, son of the owner of an electroplating unit, adjoining the ill-fated factory stated that there was some damage to their building following the mishap. “Five of our labourers were present in the factory at the time. Debris of the collapsed roof fell on three of our labourers, including Sagar, 27, Santosh, 32, and Ashok Kumar, 30, leaving them injured,” he said, adding, Sagar died after reaching hospital, while Santosh is undergoing treatment at SPS Hospital, where his condition is stated to be critical. The driver of a pick-up auto, which was parked nearby, was also injured as some of the debris fell on him. He received 24 stitches on his head. Kin wait anxiously for loved ones to be rescuedAs rescue operations continued around them, kin of the labourers feared to be trapped under the debris of the roof collapse site, grew more and more anxious with each passing minute.Refusing to leave till their loved ones were rescued, the kin stayed put at the spot, their eyes glued to the remains of the building.For many, the bad news came early. Mohammad Akram, brother of one the victims identified as Mustkeen, said, “I wanted my brother to work with me near Jalandhar bypass as it is close to our home. He had been working with the contractor, Mohammad Harun, for the last three months. On Sunday night, when we were having dinner, Harun came to take my brother for work.”“He had told us that he had got a new contract. They were going to the lift the roof of a building. I tried to stop my brother, as I felt it was a risky task, but the contractor forced him to go along,” said Akram. He added, “If I had managed to convince my brother to skip this contract, his life would have been saved.”Hailing from Araria of Bihar, Mustkeen is survived by his wife, a daughter and two sons.Shamsil was one of the lucky ones. His brother Arzool was rescued by afternoon. “I had come to know about the incident around 10am. When I reached the spot, rescue operations were going on. Around afternoon, I came to know that the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) teams had rescued my brother,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ludhiana-factory-roof-collapse-witnesses-recount-horror-101617654916091.html

Her son Nirmal Singh, 66, also got the shot with her.After getting vaccinated, Harbans said, “We remained trapped in our homes for over a year due to the virus. Today, my son told me that a vaccination camp was being held nearby. So I decided to accompany him. I have been told that a few people are hesitating to take the vaccine. But I can assure you that I am feeling perfectly fine after receiving the vaccine. So there is nothing to be worried.”Her son Nirmal Singh echoed her views, “I want to tell everyone that the Covid 19 vaccine is completely safe and everyone should get themselves vaccinated at the earliest,” he said.

06-04-2021||Other||Roof collapse: Ludhiana’s industrial units run foul of most local building by-laws||The death of four labourers following the roof collapse of an auto parts factory is a grim reminder of the 2017 plastic factory collapse in the Industrial Area, which had led to the death of 16 persons, including nine firemen. Over three years and six months after the tragedy, no lessons have been learnt. A major chunk of city’s small and medium industrial units continue to violate building by-laws with no concern for safety of workers. The municipal corporation (MC) is happy, looking the other way.In Monday’s case, no permission was taken from anyone even as the owner, through a contractor, engaged 40 labourers to lift the roof of his lanter (roof or lentil), the First Information Report (FIR) says. The MC says lifting the roof is illegal, yet the area is littered with pamphlets advertising the same. Even in the 2017 incident, in which the owner of a plastic manufacturing factory, Inderjit Gola was arrested for culpable homicide, MC’s negligence was exposed as the five-storey building was actually supposed to be two-storey. More than half of the building was constructed without official sanction, endangering lives of those working there. Gola, who was booked for culpable homicide (Section 304 of the Indian Penal Code) after public outrage, is now being tried in court under the far lighter charge of Section 304A (causing death due to negligence) after he got relief from the Punjab and Haryana high court. “The case has been stayed due to covid-19 and he is out on bail,” said Gola’s advocate MP Singh. Since the incident, families of the 16 dead have been struggling to make ends meet. MC commissioner Pardeep Sabherwal said joint commissioner Kulpreet Singh has been deputed to conduct an inquiry into Monday’s incident. “Officials have been directed to check such illegalities,” he said. FIRE ANOTHER DANGEREven as the city reports 300 fire incidents every year with 70% (over 200) of these in industrial units, thousands of factories and commercial units continue to function without no-objection certificates (NOCs) for fire safety. A fire audit initiated in March 2018 to inspect commercial and industrial buildings was not completed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/roof-collapse-ludhiana-s-industrial-units-run-foul-of-most-local-building-bylaws-101617654256085.html
06-04-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: A roadside grave||It lies by the roadside, looking abandoned, ringed by weedy bushes and by hints of all sorts of litter and hidden lives crawling within. This striking-looking stone grave, in central Delhi, is to be found on the traffic-free road that goes from Humayun’s Tomb to Damdama Sahib Gurudwara.Who lies buried there?Who knows.While Delhi harbours millions of people struggling through their daily lives, it is also a metropolis of the dead. Of many graveyards and of many old unknown graves littered across the landscape—today finding themselves by the busy avenues, amid the municipality gardens, along the chai stalls, and on less travelled footpaths where they remain hidden from view. Some of these graves are famous, a few are venerated as shrines of mystics, but most lie in neglect.This grave stands like another black hole in the city’s past. It clearly has to be of some eminent person. The structure is standing higher than the usual anonymous graves one is used to in the city. The grave’s stony surface seems uneven, as if forced to melt and solidify successively by the passage of several centuries and seasons. The plinth on which it stands appears to give the illusion of molten lava, newly stiffened. This sunny afternoon it looks cheerful, as if content in anonymity.Nearby, a man is lying on the pavement, sleeping soundly under the shade of a tree.Since the grave is across the road from the northern walls of the 16th century Humayun tomb monument, it might date from early Mughal-era, but it would be difficult to confirm its exact period. The gravestone is cracked, and damp, and is unadorned, without any design or calligraphy, giving no clue about the person underneath.It isn’t necessary to try to know more. In an era when every city street has been mapped for your mobile phone apps, and when you might Google something scandalous even on your boring anonymous neighbour, it is a consolation that some spots have escaped the tyranny of information. And that the person buried in this grave, for instance, is able to enjoy the precious right to be forgotten.Now a lonely-seeming animal appears, jumps over the grave and plops along its stone surface. As if it were his best friend.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-a-roadside-grave-101617653952649.html

06-04-2021||Chandigarh||Experts see no link between Punjab Covid-19 surge, farm protest gatherings||Punjab health department experts say there is no direct link between flouting of Covid-19 protocols at the farmers’ protests against the Centre’s three agriculture laws and a surge in the cases of virus infection in the state. State Covid-19 nodal officer Dr Rajesh Bhaskar said, “Our analysis reveals that 70% of the total cases reported this year so far are from urban areas where protocols were not followed at business, work and social gatherings. Only 30% of the cases are from rural areas which are hubs of farmer protests.” Also, the infection positivity rate in urban areas is 2.5% while it is 1% in rural pockets. The districts considered the hubs of farm protests, particularly those in the state’s south-west Malwa region, have the lowest cases in the state. For instance, Mansa and Barnala, which are witnessing a large number of protests and movement of farmers to Delhi, 510 and 368 cases were recorded from March 1 to April 4, much less than what many other districts are reporting in a single day. In south-west Malwa, only Bathinda district saw more than 100 daily cases on few occasions over the past one month. However, some doctors said testing in the villages of the belt has been inadequate as farmer unions have given call to boycott health department teams. Dr Bhaskar denied such reports. “Testing in all districts is being monitored as they are being given targets according to the number of cases. If the spread is slow, contract tracing will be less and so will be sampling,” he said. On Monday, 667 samples were taken in Mansa and 780 in Barnala. Districts like Ludhiana, Mohali, Jalandhar, Amritsar and Patiala are recording the highest surge in the state. Here too, most cases are being reported in the urban areas. Punjab Covid-19 management group head and former PGIMER, Chandigarh, director Dr KK Talwar said, “The likely reason behind less cases in rural areas is that the protests are being held in open areas. Virus is more likely to spread in indoor gatherings. In open areas, the chances of infection are less if you are in a small gathering and are wearing a mask,” said Dr Talwar. The health department data also shows not even a single super-spreader case has surfaced at farm protests in the state in the last 3 months. The urban pockets have seen many such incidents at marriages and funerals. In the Malwa belt, Mohali, Ludhiana and Patiala are the worst-hit districts but here too most cases were reported in urban areas, the figures show.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/experts-see-no-link-between-punjab-covid-19-surge-farm-protest-gatherings-101617653479372.html

The civic bodies of Dharamshala, Mandi, Solan and Palampur go to the polls on April 7. Dharamshala will elect its civic body for the second time, while the other three corporations are newly formed. The stakes are high for the ruling BJP, particularly CM Jai Ram Thakur in his hometown of Mandi, as the saffron party looks to continue its winning streak in the elections. Capturing the Mandi MC is not a cakewalk for the BJP in the face of rebellion by local MLA Anil Sharma, a former state power minister, who refused to campaign for the party. Sharma, the son of former Union telecom minister Sukh Ram, holds sway in Mandi town. The BJP faces revolt in six of the 15 wards in Mandi, where party candidates are pitted against rebels contesting as independents. State BJP chief Suresh Kashyap is confident of winning the election in all four MCs. He said the people have given a mandate in assembly, Lok Sabha and panchayat elections for the “pro-people polices” of the state government and this winning streak would continue. The Congress is a leaderless party which, foreseeing its defeat, has resorted to “cheap politics” of commenting against the chief minister, he added. BJP rebels queer the pitch in Dharamshala In Dharamshala too, the BJP is locked in a tough battle with the Congress and the rebels are ready to queer the pitch for the ruling party. Jai Ram Thakur has campaigned with all his might on his home turf but the voters in the rural areas that were merged in the Mandi MC are opposed to the government. While the Congress entrusted its election campaign to former Dharamshala MLA Sudhir Sharma, the BJP roped in firebrand minister Rakesh Pathania. To ensure its victory, the party brought in its troubleshooter and former Naina Devi legislator Randhir Sharma and Union minister of state for finance Anurag Thakur in the last leg. The rebels are contesting in 10 of the town’s 17 wards. The party faces charges of intimidating independent candidates. While the Congress hopes to retain the Dharamshala MC citing development works, the BJP has charged it with corruption and delay in execution of the Central University project. In Palampur, the BJP has to contend with rebellion as the party’s troubleshooters failed to convince the rebels to withdraw their candidature. Sudhir Sharma said the development was Congress’ main poll plank whereas the BJP has nothing to list as achievement and thus was misleading people by levelling baseless allegations. He said the Congress will win Dharamshala MC with a thumping majority. Water shortage main poll issue in Solan Solan is the only corporation where the BJP house is in order. Former state party chief and ex-Speaker Rajeev Bindal, who has represented Solan in the assembly twice, is being largely credited for better management. Water shortage in the town is top on the agenda of both the BJP and the Congress. Bindal said Jai Ram Thakur was familiar with the problems in Solan town. He said the Congress has done nothing for Solan and the BJP will win all the 17 wards in the elections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/bjp-fights-uphill-mc-poll-battle-in-himachal-as-campaign-ends-today-101617653359870.html

The structure was erected in the 18th century by Sardar Jassa Singh Ramgarhia to protect the Golden Temple from the invasion of foreign rulers.“SGPC president Bibi Jagir Kaur will inaugurate work for reopening the entrance from the Parkarma on Tuesday. This will ensure that the sangat visiting the Sri Harmandar Sahib (the Golden Temple) can also visit this structure, with a major place in Sikh history, especially related to the 18th century,” said SGPC spokesman Kulwinder Singh Ramdas. The building of the Bunga adjoins Guru Ram Das Langar Hall (community kitchen) and its two minars along parkarma enhance beauty and attraction of the complex of the holiest Sikh shrine. Currently, it is accessible only from the langar hall, which is situated outside the Parkarma. This entrance is unknown to most devotees. Most historic bungas lying along the parkarma were demolished a few decades ago, this is the only Bunga that is still standing due to efforts of Ramgarhia Sikhs. The Sikh community, especially the Ramgarhias, have hailed this move of the apex gurdwara body.Sikh author Diljit Singh Bedi, also a former office-bearer said, “Initially, all Bungas including Ramgarhia Bunga were opened in the parkarma of Sri Harmandar Sahib. When parkarma was rebuilt under Kar Sewa during British era, the doors of this Bunga were closed from the parkarma.”“The Ramgarhias have been demanding reopening of these doors. It is good if the SGPC has met its demand as this is a precious structure of the Sikh community. I suggest a museum depicting the related history should be established inside this Bunga,” he added.The Ramgarhia Bunga houses a granite slab of Takht-e-Taus from the Red Fort on which all the Mughal emperors were crowned in Delhi. This slab was seized by Sikhs from Delhi, during an attack against the Mughal armies, and brought back to Amritsar as a symbol that the Mughal Empire will end with the removal of their coronation stone.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/devotees-to-have-access-to-ramgarhia-bunga-from-golden-temple-parikarma-101617653358700.html

The 1.3km-long bridge aims to boost connectivity to the Valley and is being built at a cost of ₹1,486 crore as a part of the Udhampur-Srinagar-Baramulla Railway Link (USBRL) project. The bridge, which is 35 metres higher than the Eiffel Tower, is expected to be completed within a year, said Northern Railway general manager Ashutosh Gangal. “It is a historic day for the Northern Railways,” he added. Railways minister Piyush Goyal watched the lowering of the closure segment of the arch by a cable crane through a video link from Delhi. “This was one of the most difficult part of the bridge. This achievement is a major leap towards the completion of the 111km winding stretch from Katra to Banihal. It is arguably the biggest civil engineering challenge faced by any railway project in India in recent history,” he said. The Monday’s fixture completed the shape of the arch that will then loom over the treacherous Chenab, flowing some 359 metres below. After completion of the arch work, removal of the stay cables, filling of the concrete in the arch rib, erection of the steel trestle, launching of the viaduct and track laying work will be taken up. This bridge is 1,315 metres long. The construction of the bridge involves fabrication of 28,660 MT steel, 10 lakh cubic metre earthwork, and 66,000 cubic metre of concrete. The sophisticated ‘Tekla’ software has been used for structural detailing and the steel is suitable for -10 degrees Celsius to 40 degrees Celsius, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/arch-of-world-s-highest-railway-bridge-on-chenab-completed-101617653356338.html

The Federation of Arhtiyas’ Associations of Punjab in its ‘Mandi Bachao Mahasammelan’ at Bagha Purana announced that the arhtiyas will not purchase the rabi produce this season if the new payment mode is not withdrawn. The arhtiyas also demanded release of pending of ₹131 crore from state government. The wheat procurement in the state is scheduled to start from April 10. Federation president Vijay Kalra said, “We have decided to boycott the wheat procurement. The Centre has time till April 9 to withdraw the DBT mode of payment.” He said, “The central government should ask farmers what they want. Most farmers fear that the banks will deduct their money if they receive payment through DBT as they have taken loans. They want the old mode of payment to continue.” ‘Confront MLAs, MPs for not supporting agitation’ Sanyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) senior leader Balbir Singh Rajewal gave a call to confront every MLA and MP as they haven’t supported the farmers’ movement wholeheartedly. “We have received reports that the political parties have given directions to their cadres and MLAs to weaken the movement in Punjab. Political parties’ support to farmers is a façade,” Rajewal said. Ruldu Singh Mansa, another senior leader of the SKM, said, “The political parties are making noise that they are with farmers. But they are just trying to cash in on the farmers’ agitation. There are around 10 roads that lead to Delhi. If they are with farmers, why do not they block these roads.” SKM leader Gurnam Singh Chaduni said, “The farmers will march towards Parliament in May because those who enacted the laws sit there.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/arhtiyas-won-t-procure-wheat-if-dbt-payment-mode-not-withdrawn-101617653299616.html

The Capital had not crossed the 5% mark since December 2, and this number also fell below 1%, and stayed beneath that threshold for 82 days.Experts regard the test positivity rate as a crucial metric to gauge the spread of an infection in a region. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends a positivity rate below 5% for a two-week period for an infection to be considered under control.The number of tests conducted dropped on Sunday as compared to the previous week, when more than 72,000 samples were collected on average in the city each day.Click here for complete Covid-19 coverage“We have increased testing to between 80,000 and 90,000 a day. Whoever is found positive is isolated. We are tracing 20 to 30 contacts for each positive case and trying to contain them as well. We are also making micro-containment zones so that the spread of the infection is curtailed,” Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain said in a press briefing on Monday.The government also ordered 65 government and private hospitals to increase the number of Covid-19 beds, as hospitalisations continued to rise. The number of hospitalisations has inched close to 3,000, with 2,975 people admitted across city hospitals as on Sunday night.Jain on Monday also urged people who have recently recovered from the infection to donate plasma.He said the donations dropped over the last two months because there were few eligible donors, owing to the low infection rate over the last few months.“I appeal to all those who have recovered from Covid-19 to donate plasma,” said Jain in a press briefing.“The cases have gone up suddenly, and it appears that the virus is more infectious. The behaviour of the people adds to the problem. New cases had gone down so much that people thought it [the pandemic] is over, and nobody thought it would come back. But we foresaw this. We saw the increase in cases in western countries,” said Dr Suranjit Chaterjee, senior consultant of internal medicine at Indraprastha Apollo hospital.The numbers reported on Monday correspond to tests carried out a day before, which is typically fewer in number on account of it being a weekend.A comparison of weekend case numbers captures how the situation in the Capital took a worrying turn over a span of four weeks: On March 15, 368 cases were reported from the tests a day earlier at a positivity rate of 0.6%.The following week, new cases grew to 888 while the positivity rate inched up to 1.3%.On March 29, the day of Holi, the positivity rate at 2.7% was double compared to a week ago. That day, 1,904 cases were recorded.In the week since Holi, when experts and officials urged people to minimise celebrations and visits to people outside of their household, the positivity rate rose exactly by double to clock in at 5.4%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhis-test-positivity-rate-past-5-mark-after-124-days-101617652822923.html

The shortfall in payment from the government to the power corporation against the power subsidy bill touched a whopping ₹6,414 crore last fiscal, which is expected to increase further in the election year (2022). The Punjab government is giving free electricity to agricultural tubewells, 200 units of free power to Scheduled Caste (SC) families and some weaker sections of society, besides giving subsidised electricity at ₹5 per unit to industry. As per the data compiled by the PSPCL for the 2020-21 fiscal that ended on March 31, Punjab government had paid only ₹9,986 crore against the power subsidy bill of ₹16,400 crore decided by the Punjab State Electricity Regulatory Commission (PSERC), leaving a gap of ₹6,414 crore. The government paid ₹6,743 crore in cash and the remaining were book adjustments in lieu of interests of Uday Bonds, infrastructure development fee, and electricity duty that the government collects. “Though, the government has paid more than the previous years, but it has defaulted almost 40% of the subsidy amount. For the last seven years, the default is increasing every year, forcing the PSPCL to take loans for working capital,” said a power engineer on condition of anonymity. Officials said PSPCL chairman-cum-managing director (CMD) A Venu Parsad has taken up the matter with the finance department repeatedly, but the issue is yet to be resolved. In fact, the arrears of last six fiscals, which amount to ₹6,500 crore (approx), had put the state government and subsequently the PSPCL under a financial stress. The power regulator had even given liberty to PSPCL to discontinue free power supply if the state government fails to pay up. However, the PSPCL never challenges the government on this account as the power subsidy is a political issue in the state, said an official. Every year, the default amount is passed on to the next fiscal. If ₹6,414-crore arrears of this year is passed on to the next year, the power subsidy bill will stand at approximately ₹17,000 crore. And previous trends show that the shortfall increases in an election year, as the government pumps in more funds for development works. Despite repeated attempts, additional chief secretary (power) Anurag Aggarwal could not be contacted for his comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/govt-owes-6-414-crore-to-pspcl-against-power-subsidy-bill-101617652995827.html

The agency discovered during investigation that the suspended cop had taken a train to Thane from CSMT on March 4, the day Hiran — who is linked to the explosives-laden car found outside industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s home Antilia in February — went missing. At 11:40pm, a group of eight to 10 NIA officers took Vaze to platform number 4, from where he had boarded a train to Thane on March 4. Hiran was allegedly murdered on March 4 and his body was found floating in a creek at Retibunder in Mumbra the next day. Earlier in the day, NIA had seized a high-end bike in the Antilia case from Daman. The bike was brought to the NIA office at Pedder Road and thoroughly examined by a Central Forensic Science Laboratory team from Pune on Monday. The bike, a Benelli DSK TNT 600GT, is registered at Thane in the name of a woman, suspected to be known to Sachin Vaze, said NIA. She was seen in a CCTV grab with Vaze at a five-star hotel with a currency counting machine in her hand.

In 2020-21, the varsity had recorded a deficit of ₹296 crore, so if achieved, it will be reduced by 60% by the end of this fiscal. There has been a major cut in expenditure with budgetary proposals putting it at ₹472 crore, a cut of almost 30% over ₹676 crore in the last fiscal. The varsity’s income, however, is also projected to fall to ₹342 crore, a reduction of 10% over ₹380 crore last year. Officiating vice-chancellor IAS officer Ravneet Kaur, who is also the chairperson of the syndicate, said the budget was realistic. “The budgetary proposals have quoted actual and realistic figures related to both income and expenditure,” the V-C said. She claimed that previous years’ budgets were a farce. “The budget presented by the university authorities in the past financial years carried vague and superficial figures related to its expenses and income,” she claimed.INCREASE IN GUEST FACULTY REMUNERATION WITHDRAWNOn the proposal of the finance committee, the syndicate has also withdrawn the increased rates of the honorarium of guest faculty, presently working on per lecture basis on the varsity campus and its satellite institutions. According to revised rates finalised in March 2020, guest faculty are getting ₹525 per lecture from the previous ₹350 for a 45-minute lecture. For a one-hour lecture, the faculty gets ₹750 per lecture than ₹500 earlier. The rates were enhanced subject to a maximum remuneration of ₹30,000 per month. “An academic review committee has been formed which will verify and assess workload of guest faculty working on the varsity campus,” said a syndicate member on the condition of anonymity.The university syndicate has finalised a plan on settling ₹120 crore overdraft it has taken to pay salaries. The finance committee proposed that the varsity must pay ₹10 crore starting from October this year till 2023. From 2023 onwards, the university will pay ₹2.5 crore every month for the next three years, it was decided.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/punjabi-university-passes-rs-129-cr-deficit-budget-101617651076533.html
06-04-2021||Other||Dilip Walse Patil gets charge of Maharashtra home dept||In 2019, when the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government was formed, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader Dilip Walse Patil was a top contender for the home minister’s post. However, he preferred low-profile portfolios such as the excise and labour departments. Fifteen months on, the seven-term legislator from Ambegaon constituency in Pune district is the new home minister of the state.A close confidant of NCP chief Sharad Pawar, Walse Patil, 64, is known as a shrewd politician and a good administrator. In the past two decades, he handled the responsibilities as the minister for energy, finance, higher and technical education and excise. He was also the Speaker of the Maharashtra Assembly between 2009 and 2014, and shares cordial relations with leaders across the parties.Though his father, Dattatray, was a Member of Legislative Assembly (MLA) between 1967 and 1972, Walse Patil went to a district council school at his village Nirgudsar. He completed his Master of Law from a college in Mumbai and worked as Pawar’s personal assistant (PA), when the latter was Maharashtra’s chief minister for the second time in the late 1980s. Pawar, who was then a key Congress leader in Maharashtra, reluctantly gave Walse Patil a party ticket in 1990 from Ambegaon, considered to be a strong hold of Janata Dal, and was represented by stalwart Kisanrao Bankhele. Walse Patil was elected to the Assembly from the seat and never looked back. “The decision to join as Pawar’s PA was his conscious move, as he wanted to enter politics and watch his leader very closely heading the state. His father and Pawar were friends for years, after being elected to the Assembly for the first time together in 1967. His position helped him bag the ticket from a relatively difficult constituency, but also cultivated him as a shrewd politician, and he displayed the acumen as minister while handling very important departments including energy, higher and technical education and even as the Assembly Speaker,” said an NCP leader, who has closely worked with Walse Patil.In 2019, ahead of MVA’s formation, Walse Patil was asked to head the home department by his party chief, but he had reportedly refused the post. Leaders from MVA government, however, feel that it is the right choice made at the right time by the party leadership. “He is a politician who likes to speak less. He commanded respect in the departments he headed and had courage to take tough decisions. He is taking the reins of the home department at the time when the police force is infested with factionalism and groupism. He will ensure that the police force falls in line within no time,” said political analyst Pratap Asbe. Walse Patil was one of the first Congress legislators to join NCP, formed by Pawar in May 1999. In his third term as a legislator, he was made the higher and technical education minister in the alliance government formed by the Congress and NCP in 1999. In 2002, he was given the additional charge of energy department, while in 2004 the medical education was added to his portfolio, which he continued to handle till December 2008. He was the finance minister for about 11 months till October 2009. “The energy department came to him when the state was reeling under load shedding because of power shortage. He successfully chalked out a plan to set up new generation projects with 6,000-MW (megawatts) capacity and strengthening of power infrastructure. The Maharashtra State Electricity Board was restructured into four companies in 2005 under his leadership. Similarly, the formation of the Maharashtra Knowledge Corporation, which played a key role in computer literacy in the state, was founded under his leadership. Will he be able to clear the mess in home department which has now put the MVA government in trouble? Only time will tell.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/dilip-walse-patil-gets-charge-of-maharashtra-home-dept-101617651015071.html
06-04-2021||Mumbai||Deshmukh’s exit: The start of Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi alliance’s troubles?||The ruling Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) coalition, especially the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) faced an embarrassment on Monday as home minister Anil Deshmukh had to resign following the Bombay high court’s (HC) decision to ask the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to conduct preliminary probe into allegations of corruption against him. Though NCP had decided not to drop Deshmukh (an NCP legislator) from the cabinet, the latter had to put in his papers after HC remarked how the Mumbai Police could probe allegations against the head of their department.When the state government announced probe by a retired judge into the allegations against Deshmukh on March 30, it was assumed that he would be asked to resign. This was necessary to ensure a fair probe and to send a message to people that the government was serious about the corruption allegations. According to party leaders, the NCP top brass did not want any action against Deshmukh immediately, though there was unanimity about shifting him out of the home department at a later stage. However, the HC order and the remarks made by the court forced NCP to ask Deshmukh to resign. The delay on their part or the assumption that HC would not have ordered a CBI probe has led to an embarrassment for the party.But then it has been a pattern with the MVA government and the NCP in the series of unexpected events ever since a vehicle with gelatin sticks was found outside the residence of industrialist Mukesh Ambani on February 25.Series of goof ups It began with a flip-flop over police officer Sachin Vaze. The government took its own time to shift him out of Mumbai Police’s crime intelligence unit, which was initially probing the case, even as Opposition leader Devendra Fadnavis made direct allegations against him. While the Fadnavis-led Opposition launched a full-scale attack on the government following the death of trader Mansukh Hiran, the MVA’s response was confused, and lacked coordination. Vaze was suspended only after he was arrested. The same pattern was seen after allegations were made against Deshmukh over corruption, first by Fadnavis and then former Mumbai Police chief Param Bir Singh.A reason for the same was the differences between chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray and NCP chief Sharad Pawar. According to MVA leaders, Thackeray wanted NCP to drop Deshmukh from the cabinet following the allegation made by Singh. The NCP leadership on the other hand did not want to react immediately without understanding the political moves of the Opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which is also ruling in the Centre.“There was clear lack of coordination between the allies. The approach to handle the issue seemed casual. There was no reason for the government to delay the announcement for probe. And once the probe was announced, they should have asked Deshmukh to resign or kept him away from the home department. It is hard to understand why a seasoned politician like Pawar did not do so,” opined political analyst Hemant Desai.“With the entry of the CBI, things would no longer remain in control of the MVA government, as the central agency will conduct its own probe into the issue. And we have seen how the non-BJP parties have been accusing BJP of using central agencies against them for political purposes,” he added.A senior Congress minister pointed out: “NIA is already probing the Antilia explosives case. Now CBI will probe the corruption allegations against Deshmukh. It is just a matter of time that the Enforcement Directorate too joins them in probing the [alleged] dealings of Vaze, and those whose names have been cropping up in this controversy. Imagine what will happen if they find links to any of the top MVA politicians.”The fallout of the CBI probe is that the central agencies have now got something to put some of the key MVA leaders under the scanner. It could lead anywhere and affect the stability of the MVA government if any of their top leaders find themselves in trouble.“If something like this happens, the political stability of the government could get affected. There seems to be tough times ahead for the Thackeray-led government,” said Desai.Options before MVAIt has been a month of damage control for MVA leaders, and they are far from succeeding in it. With HC’s order on Monday, things could become more complicated.“Our immediate plan is to challenge the court order on CBI probe. Why is there a need for a parallel probe when a retired HC judge is probing the allegations,” said a senior NCP minister.The MVA will take a call on whether to challenge the decision in the Supreme Court as a government, or let Deshmukh appeal against it.The three parties will also have to come together and plan a joint strategy, which does not seem to be the case as of now.“It’s a three-party government and whatever happens, all the partners will have to face the consequences. However, the Vaze-Deshmukh controversy was treated as NCP’s matter. NCP consulted CM because they had to, but didn’t bother to seek our opinion. If it is a political battle, then all the three parties need to fight it together,” pointed out a senior Congress leader.“The MVA’s problems are unlikely to end with Deshmukh’s resignation. In fact, they would begin now,” he added.Meanwhile, Fadnavis on Monday said that some more names will come to light for their “involvement in the extortion case” during CBI investigation.“As per the information I have, there are few more names that will be exposed in the course of investigation of the case. I would not name them now, but a lot more information will come to the fore soon. The alleged involvement of the [former] home minister is just the tip of the iceberg. I believe many heavy weights from the ruling parties are involved into the entire case of extortion. If there is money laundering or other money trail found to be involved, ED may also come into the picture,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/deshmukhs-exit-the-start-of-maharashtra-vikas-aghadi-alliance-s-troubles-101617650895094.html
06-04-2021||Other||Favour DBT, but Centre should defer it this wheat season: BKU (Ugrahan)||Even as the Centre and the state governments slug it out over the payment method to be adopted for wheat procurement, Bhartiya Kisan Union (Ekta-Ugrahana), the largest farmer rights’ organisation in Punjab, has supported the direct payment mode to cultivators, bypassing the arthiyas or middlemen. However, union general secretary Sukhdev Singh Kokrikalan said on Monday that keeping in view of ongoing farmers’ agitation, which arthiyas have also joined, the Centre should postpone implementing direct benefit transfer (DBT) for the time being.He added that in the larger interest of wheat growers, the Centre should drop the clause of submission of land record, as a prerequisite of payment. “Since Punjab government has no official database to distinguish between cultivators and farmland owners, DBT would be jeopardised, if it is implemented forcibly. In this wheat season, the government should release payments through arthiyas and Punjab should build land record data to implement direct payment. This will benefit cultivators,” he added.He clarified that BKU’s demand of payment for wheat through arthiyas was meant to ensure it does not create a division in the agitation. Kokrikalan added that the call to gherao Food Corporation of India (FCI) offices in districts of Punjab on Monday saw a huge response from the agrarian community. “Farmer unions did not seek support of arthiyas, but they joined the agitating farmers for their own survival. Hundreds of workers are also dependent upon them for mandi work. The government should provide easy loans for cultivators to get rid of the unwanted arthiya system,” said Kokrikalan.He added that the conventional method of making payment to middlemen in foodgrain system is irrational and indicated exploitation of farmers. Indian agriculture is a rare exception where the producer is deprived of direct payment and practise should be stopped, he added.“Most arthiyas are unscrupulous moneylenders and there are instances of examples of them exploiting farmers. These moneylenders give loans on exorbitant interest and even manipulate record to exploit farmers. Our union is clear that cultivators have a natural right to get paid for their agricultural produce and must get the payment directly,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/favour-dbt-but-centre-should-defer-it-this-wheat-season-bku-ugrahan-101617650655775.html

As per the guidelines, an area within a radius of 25 metres will be a containment zone in case of emergence of single Covid-19 case while 50-metre radius area will be a containment zone in case of two or more cases and will be considered as a cluster.Elaborate arrangements were in place to cater to the needs of people residing in the affected areas, said officials. LMC officials said till now a containment zone was restricted to the house of a Covid-affected individual. But in case the number of infected people is more than one in a lane, the entire lane will be defined as a containment zone. “With the new guidelines, the area within 25 metres radius will be defined as a containment zone, if one person is found infected. However, if the number of people is more than one in an area, the containment zone would be established in 50-metre radius of the area,” said Dr SK Rawat, nagar swasthya adhikari, LMC, who ensures the establishment of containment zones. The nagar swasthya Adhikari said there were over 3,050 containment zones in the city. LMC records suggest that Indira Nagar tops the list of areas having maximum containment zones. There are over 400 containment zones in Indira Nagar locality – starting from Khurram Nagar to Chinhat crossing. Second on the list was Gomti Nagar, which had around 300 containment zones. Similarly, Aliganj had 182 containment zones, Alambagh 200, followed by Ashiana 190. “We have passed on the fresh containment zone guidelines to the officials. They will ensure strict implementation of guidelines,” added Rawat. Meanwhile, the district administration was re-introducing door-to-door home delivery system in areas having containment zones. “We have decided to restore door-to-door home delivery system in areas having containment zones. The facility is aimed at ensuring regular supply of essential goods to people residing in affected areas,” said Abhishek Prakash, district magistrate, Lucknow. Prakash said the administration had prepared a list of delivery boys, traders and shops and circulated their phone numbers among the people through local corporators. “The Covid surge is worrisome. And the large number of containment zones is making the situation more deplorable,” said Prakash Sharma, who resides in A Block of Indira Nagar (one of the most affected areas). Sharma said though the administration claimed to have made elaborate arrangements for door-to-door delivery of essentials, the picture here remained different. “Most of the time, phone numbers of delivery boys remain busy, possibly due to bulk orders. And many times they are not keen on delivering goods in small quantities,” he lamented. Dileep Srivastava, corporator of Maithlee Sharan Gupta ward (Indira Nagar), claimed to have made all possible arrangements to cater to the needs of people. “We are ensuring regular supply of essentials and medicines. We have circulated our mobile numbers among people who are free to call us round the clock. However, there are chances when one may skip the order due to bulk orders,” he said. .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/3050-containment-zones-in-lucknow-indira-nagar-tops-list-with-400-101617650479774.html

They then drove off towards Sector 54 school on separate motorcycles.Police said that the spot where the crime took place didn’t have CCTV coverage, however footage of cameras installed nearby were being scanned for clues on the accused.“We are probing all possible angles, even the involvement of any insiders. We are yet to verify the claims about a revolver and knife being used by the snatchers,” said Shruti Arora, assistant superintendent of police (south).A case has been registered under Section 379 (A) of the IPC at Sector 39 police station.‘They threatened to shoot me if I moved’ Rajinder told the police that after closing the store at 9pm, he went around the back where his car was parked. He kept his bag in the four-wheeler and went to urinate. As he returned to his car, four bike-borne persons appeared and put a revolver to his neck.“They told me not to move or they would shoot me and asked me to hand over my belongings,” said Rajinder, who surrendered ₹1 lakh cash and his gold ring to the robbers.His brother Rajesh stated in his complaint that he was standing near his scooter when the miscreants approached him. “They threatened me with a knife and a gun and took ₹2 lakh and gold kara from me,” said Rajesh.Borrowed phone from watchman to call cops The Bansal brothers claimed that the accused had thrown their phones at a distance, but they couldn’t locate them in the dark after the robbers were gone. So, the duo borrowed a watchman’s phone to contact the police and report the armed snatching incident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/bizmen-brothers-robbed-of-3-lakh-at-gunpoint-in-chandigarh-101617650175733.html

The chief minister while reviewing the unlock situation at a high level meeting at his official residence here said sufficient number of para medical staff, nurses, medicines, medical equipment and back up of oxygen should be made in all hospitals. “Effective arrangements should be maintained for protection and treatment of Covid-19. Both Covid and non-Covid hospitals should be set up for treatment of patients suffering from any ailment,” he said.He said ambulance services should be run effectively and made it clear that those ambulances used for Covid patients should not be used for non-Covid patients. He also said patients should not be made to wait for ambulances. Yogi said infection rate of new strain of Covid-19 was very high and there was a need to maintain a strict vigil. “No gathering of more than 100 persons should be allowed at public places/programmes. Additional vigil should be maintained in Lucknow, Kanpur Nagar, Prayagraj, Varanasi and Gorakhpur. Special care should be taken in districts having more than 100 Covid-19 cases,” the CM said. He said work on contact tracing should be carried out effectively and testing for Covid-19 should be carried out to the optimum. “RTPCR tests should be mandatorily carried out in all the doubtful cases.

06-04-2021||Chandigarh||Active Covid cases get into 5 digits in Haryana||The number of active Covid cases and per week infections in Haryana got into five digits last week as the virus spread continued for an eighth consecutive week.However, there are two bits of good news as well. The state on Monday crossed the two-million mark by vaccinating 1,44,202 individuals during the twice-a-week mega-vaccination drive. Also, last week (March 29-April 4), increase in number of Covid cases were 2,523 as compared to 3,200 cases from the week before.According to the health department statistics, the state registered 10,414 cases last week as compared to 7,891 cases the week before (March 22-28).Gurugram with 3,167 active cases followed by Karnal 1,764, Ambala 1,350, Kurukshetra 1,059, and Panchkula with 1,046 cases were the leading districts in terms of active cases. The state’s recovery rate was 94.57% and case fatality rate was 1.07%.State nodal officer for Covid-19, Dr Dhruva Chaudhary said the virus is ascending fast. “After April 15, it will further pick pace and reach peak level by May-end. The surge in Gurugram is predictable. But what is worrisome is the spike in Karnal, Kurukshetra and Panchkula districts,” Dr Chaudhary said.VACCINATION STEPPED UPAdditional chief secretary, health, Rajeev Arora said they have stepped up the vaccination roll out and administered 1.44 lakh vaccine doses on the first day of mega-vaccination day.“We have vaccinated 20,12,332 individuals as on Monday. About 1,449 vaccination centres were set up for the drive. And 95% beneficiaries inoculated on Monday were above 60 years of age or between 45 to 60 years,” the ACS said.Arora said 1.9 lakh healthcare workers (HCWs) have been administered the first dose of vaccine and about 1.14 lakh HCWs were administered the second dose.About 1.2 lakh frontline workers (FLWs) have been administered the first dose of the vaccine and 43,494 got the second dose.POSITIVITY RATE GOES UPHealth officials said sample positivity rate last week increased to 4.7 % from 4.6%.Four districts - Faridabad (8.4%), Gurugram (6.7%), Rewari (6.5%) and Panchkula (6.1%) continued to have a critical positivity rate of over 6%.Fifteen districts still have a positivity rate in the range of 2.7% to 5.4%. This meant that it is lower than the critical positivity rate of over 6% but higher than the desirable positivity rate of less than 2%.Three districts - Nuh (0.8%), Charkhi Dadri (1.1%) and Jhajjar (1.8%) continue to have a desirable positivity rate of less than 2% for the last few weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/active-covid-cases-get-into-5-digits-in-haryana-101617650003472.html

The municipal corporation is convening the first meeting of the newly elected General House at 3pm on April 8, where the councillors will take oath of office and elect the mayor, senior deputy mayor and deputy mayor.MC commissioner Kamal Kumar Garg said the agenda for the meeting has been issued to all the councillors. “Ropar divisional commissioner Anurag Verma will administer the oath, following which the elections will take place,” he said. In the elections held for 50 wards in February, the Congress won 37 seats while the Azad Group got 10 and three went to Independents. With the Congress enjoying a clear majority, its nominees are set to occupy the three posts. According to highly placed sources in the party, Amarjeet Singh Sidhu, 48, a first-time councillor from Ward No. 10 and brother of Punjab health minister Balbir Singh Sidhu, is the front runner for the post of mayor, while former senior deputy mayor Rishiv Jain, another contender, might have to contend with the same post once again. Kuljeet Bedi, who has won for the third time, is likely to get awarded with the post of deputy mayor, said sources.Amarjeet, who is looking after his family’s liquor and real estate business in Mohali, said he will accept whatever responsibility is given to him by the party. “For now, we should wait for April 8 as the party is yet to announce the names for all posts,” he said.In the 2015 elections, the SAD-BJP combine had won 23 seats, the Congress got 14, the Azad Group grabbed 10 and two went to Independents. Azad Group leader Kulwant Singh, a realtor, managed to get elected as Mohali’s first mayor with the Congress support.

06-04-2021||Chandigarh||Collector rates revised in Chandigarh after four years||Revising the collector rate after four years, the Chandigarh administration has slashed it by 10% for commercial properties and by 5% for industrial plots.However, the rate for agricultural land has been enhanced by 10%, while there is no change in the case of residential properties. The decision was taken in a meeting chaired by deputy commissioner Mandip Singh Brar on Monday.“The new collector rates have been decided after an analysis of sale deeds registered as well as survey of markets and villages. These will be enforced from April 12,” said Brar.Collector rate is the minimum property value below which it cannot be registered with the government. On collector rate, stamp duty is also paid.The reduction in rates was a long-pending demand of different business and industrial associations. The issue was also taken up in the latest administrator’s advisory council meeting. In 2017, the rate for commercial and residential properties was cut by 10% and 5%, respectively. Welcoming the decision, Kamal Gupta, president, Property Consultant Association, Chandigarh, said: “In some areas, the collector rate is much higher than market prices. We had sought around 20-25% reduction, but the administration’s decision will still help in reviving the real estate market.”Pankaj Khanna, president, Industries Association of Chandigarh, said rationalisation of collector rates was the need of the hour and will help entrepreneurs restructure their asset to ward off economic crisis.The revised ratesIn the Industrial Area, Phase I and II, the collector rate has been decreased from ₹65,894 to ₹62,599 per square yard. For agricultural land, it has gone up from ₹1,15,50,000 to ₹1,27,05,000 per acre.When it comes to commercial properties (SCOs/SCFs/bay shops) along Madhya Marg and Sector-34/35 road, Sector 22 and Sub City Centre in Sector 34, it has gone down from ₹4,16,988 to ₹3,75,289 per square yard. In Sector 17, it has been reduced from ₹5,83,783 to ₹5,25,404 per square yard.In the Manimajra motor market, it has been slashed from ₹3,08,880 to ₹2,77,992 per square yard. The collector rates for shops in multiplexes and other malls have also been incorporated as was done for Elante Mall previously.Rationalised for housing societiesThe administration has also rationalised the collector rates for Chandigarh Housing Board/society flats, industrial houses and flats at Uppal Marble Arch, Manimajra. Now, the rates will be calculated on covered area basis (per square foot) rather than plot size (per square yard). For ground floor, it has been fixed at ₹4,500 per square foot. For first, second and third floor, it is ₹4,000, ₹3,690 and ₹3,200 respectively. For Uppal Marble Arch, it has been fixed at ₹6,000 per square foot.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/collector-rates-revised-in-chandigarh-after-four-years-101617649876304.html
06-04-2021||Mumbai||Bombay HC sets aside Bhalchandra Shirsat’s disqualification from BMC standing committee||The Bombay high court (HC) on Monday struck down the decision of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s (BMC) general body to disqualify BJP-nominated corporator Bhalchandra Shirsat as a standing committee member. HC has ordered the civic body to reinstate him as a member of the standing committee of the civic body.Shirsat had approached the HC after the chairman of the standing committee had disqualified him on October 21, 2020. A division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni had concluded hearing of Shirsat’s petition last month and had reserved its order. During the hearing, advocate Amogh Singh for Shirsat had informed the court that the rules relied upon by the BMC standing committee to disqualify Shirsat was not as per the Mumbai Municipal Corporation Act, and hence it was “illegal” and in “colourable exercise of power”. The standing committee had based its disqualification of Shirsat on the fact that a member was required to be an elected member, and Shirsat’s disqualification was justified as he was a nominated member. BMC had opposed Shirsat’s petition on the grounds that he had not challenged the rules, which the HC had accepted and directed him to pay ₹1 lakh to the civic body for “wasting BMC’s time”. Thereafter, Shirsat had sought permission to amend the petition which was allowed and he challenged the rules that the civic body had relied on while disqualifying him. On October 23, the day when the civic body had held an urgent general body meeting to ratify the decision of the standing committee, the HC had granted interim relief to Shirsat to continue as a member of the standing committee until his plea was heard. While passing its order, the bench observed, “The act of removal of petitioner does not have statutory support and does not have legal ground. Petition stands allowed.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-sets-aside-bhalchandra-shirsat-s-disqualification-from-bmc-standing-committee-101617649875072.html
06-04-2021||Chandigarh||Second wave of Covid may pick pace in Haryana due to congregations||Unabashed political gatherings, social crowds and hordes of agitating farmers at Delhi borders threaten to accelerate fresh escalation of coronavirus (Covid-19) infections, now on for eight-weeks in Haryana.While the state government on Sunday tightened restrictions on assembly of people at social, academic, cultural, religious and political events and other congregations, its implementation will be a big challenge, particularly in view of the ongoing farmers’ agitation over the Centre’s three farm laws.Kisan mahapanchayats and political gatherings being held every now and then further compound the problem.“When the government is unable to remove farmers from Singhu and Tikri borders, how can one expect that tightened restrictions will be implemented? It’s all a farce,” said an official.Health officials said most protesting farmers are reluctant to get vaccinated or tested.Additional chief secretary (ACS), health, Rajeev Arora said while the data does not suggest a spurt in the infections due to assembly of farmers on Delhi borders, such gatherings are certainly a cause of concern during a surge.The situation is under control in Jhajjar and Sonepat, the two Delhi bordering districts, where farmers have assembled in big numbers. “But such gatherings can lead to a wider spread of the infection, particularly in light of the fact that a big number of agitating farmers come from Punjab where the infection and mortality rate is high. The back-and-forth movement of farmers can also contribute to spread of the contagion,” the ACS said.‘WEARING MASKS CORRECTLY IS THE KEY’State nodal officer for Covid-19, Dr Dhruva Chaudhary, who is also a member of India Task Force of Lancet Covid-19 Commission, said that political, social or religious congregations are going to add to the number of cases.“During a recent meeting of the India Task Force, we discovered that the fresh surge in Maharashtra started from Vidarbha where gram panchayat polls were held. It was a combination of vulnerable population and panchayat elections which pushed the infection rate high in the state,” he said.Dr Chaudhary added that wearing masks correctly, staying in open spaces where there is plenty of ventilation, and not pulling down masks in closed settings is key to checking spread of Covid.“This is in addition to vaccination and sampling. One must remember that the possibility of spread of the virus is much higher in closed or indoor settings,” he said.‘THERE IS NO COVID, BJP CREATING FEAR’Head of the Nain faction of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU), Joginder Singh Nain, said, “There is no coronavirus. None of the protesters have tested positive so far. The BJP government is creating fear among people in the name of the virus. If there is a virus, why are PM Narendra Modi and BJP’s senior leaders addressing rallies in poll-bound West Bengal?”State secretary of the All India Kisan Sabha, Balbir Singh Thakan, said BJP has adopted every method to suppress the voices of farmers but to no avail. Now, they are trying to lift our dharna on pretext of fresh increase in Covid cases.“People neither appear for testing nor vaccination. If the virus is so dangerous, why did Haryana chief minister (CM) Manohar Lal Khattar addressed a condolence meet in memory of Rohtak MP Arvind’s father and why did deputy CM Dushyant Chautala hold a rally ahead of Holi in Palwal? Are the rules only for protesting farmer? We will continue our agitation until our demands are met,” he said.Samyukta Kisan Morcha leader Inderjit Singh said farmers protesting at Tikri and Singhu borders are living on a village model and following all precautionary measures to tackle spread of the virus.“We have not asked anyone to resist testing or vaccination. There is no threat of Covid-19 at both the border areas,” Singh said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/second-wave-of-covid-may-pick-pace-in-haryana-due-to-congregations-101617649816637.html
06-04-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Law colleges fear two first-year batches in 2021||At a time when colleges are gearing up for summer session examinations, first-year law students are only now beginning their academic year. With admissions to first-year law courses in both three-year and five-year courses still underway, colleges are now worried that they will end up with two first-year batches in 2021, leaving them unable to handle the same.“As per the recent announcement by the examination department of the University of Mumbai (MU), first-semester law exams are scheduled to take place in the second week of June, so the second semester exams will only take place in September or October, by when the next academic year admissions will begin. How are colleges supposed to handle two different first-year batches at the same time?” asked the principal of a suburban law institute.He added that this fear is affecting teachers who have been working non-stop since September last year, when MU asked colleges to start online lectures. “Last year, they started work with second- to fifth-year law students, now they’ll start lectures for first-year batches and also conduct two rounds of examinations between May and June 2021. And by the time the first-year batch is ready to graduate, the next academic year will begin,” he said.Admissions to most professional courses were delayed by a few months this year, first due to the lockdown and then due to a petition filed in the Bombay high court for clarity on the status of the Maratha quota. In December, the registration process for most professional courses including law, engineering, architecture and pharmacy had to be delayed by a few weeks to give students time to make necessary changes to their admission form after the state government decided to continue admissions without the inclusion of the Socially and Educationally Backward Classes (SEBC) quota.After much delay, the first lists of the three-year and five-year law courses were scheduled to be released in the first week of February, but the same had to be postponed again after the state common entrance test (CET) cell received complaints of error in student information. At present, the institutional round of admissions is underway and law colleges will start regular lectures soon.While the university has declared dates of commencement of exams, the department has also asked teachers to conduct extra lectures to complete the curriculum. “Law is a course which needs to be taught at length. And since classes are being conducted online, we’ve requested teachers to conduct extra classes on weekdays and weekends to ensure that students are not at a loss of academic time,” said AK Singh, dean, law department at MU. He further added that due to the fallout of delay in the 2020-21 academic year, it is likely that admissions to the next academic year could also get delayed. “Hopefully colleges will not need to face the problem of two first-year batches studying together,” added Singh.Meanwhile, Students Law Council has approached the vice-chancellor and director of examinations and evaluation of MU, requesting them to allow the 2020-21 first-year law students to study and appear for exams together with the 2021-22 batch. “This way, students as well as teachers will get time to breath, and there will be no need for repetition of syllabus in the same year,” said Sachin Pawar, president of the council.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-law-colleges-fear-two-first-year-batches-in-2021-101617649815554.html
06-04-2021||Other||Can’t remain a mute spectator: Bombay HC on PILs against Anil Deshmukh||The Bombay high court (HC) directed the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to conduct and conclude a preliminary inquiry into the allegations raised in the three public interest litigations (PILs) as well as a writ petition filed by former Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh and others against former home minister Anil Deshmukh within 15 days. While directing the central agency for probe, HC admitted that the issues and allegations raised in the petitions were something that neither of the two judges had experienced.“The proceedings of which we are seized lays bare incidents, allegations and approaches of a kind which, at least, the two of us have not experienced before,” said the division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni at the start of its order. The bench also observed in its 52-page judgment that Malabar Hill police had failed to take action on advocate Dr Jaishri Patil’s complaint, which had pointed to a cognisable offence being committed by Deshmukh. HC noted that it could not remain a “mute spectator” to the complaints received against high-level officers and ruled, “It is, hence, certainly an issue of credibility of state machinery, which would stare at face when confronted with the expectations of law and when such complaints are received against high-ranking public officials. This court cannot be a mute spectator in these circumstances.” It further observed that as the state police force was under Deshmukh [he resigned after HC’s directions for probe], it would serve the ends of justice if a preliminary probe was conducted by an independent agency such as CBI. “Deshmukh is home minister. The police department is under his control and direction. There can be no fair, impartial, unbiased and untainted probe if the same were entrusted to the state police force. As of necessity, probe has to be entrusted to an independent agency like CBI,” noted the bench in its judgment. “The allegations made by Shri Param Bir Singh are serious in nature and against the highest functionary of the government of Maharashtra, when it comes to the functioning of the police department. Prima facie, the issues are such that the very faith of citizens in the functioning of the police department is at stake. If there is any amount of truth in such allegations, certainly it has a direct effect on the citizens’ confidence in the police machinery in the state. Such allegations, therefore, cannot remain unattended and are required to be looked into in the manner known to law when prima facie they indicate commission of a cognisable offence. It is, hence, certainly an issue of credibility of the state machinery, which would stare at the face when confronted with the expectations of the law and when such complaints are received against high-ranking public officials,” the court observed.Singh in his petition had alleged that the former home minister had bypassed him and directed police officers to “collect extortion/protection money” from restaurants and bars. He had further stated that even while the role of suspended assistant police inspector Sachin Vaze in the Antilia explosives threat case was being investigated, Singh was transferred to home guards by a home department order of March 17. Singh’s petition had stated that he had apprised the chief minister and the deputy chief minister of these developments through a letter on March 20, but as no action was taken against Deshmukh, he had approached the Supreme Court. However, after the Apex court directed him to approach HC, he had filed a criminal public interest litigation (PIL) seeking probe to unearth the alleged malpractices by Deshmukh through an independent agency such as CBI or the National Investigation Agency (NIA). HC said, “It is indeed unheard of and unprecedented that a minister could be so openly accused of wrongdoings and corrupt practices by none other than a senior police officer attracting wide attention from all and sundry.”Patil’s PIL pointed out that the police had failed to initiate any action on Patil’s plaint, let alone file a first information report (FIR). In light of this, the high court observed, “Such allegations, therefore, can’t remain unattended and are required to be looked into in manner known to law when prima facie they indicate commission of cognisable offence.” While citing an SC judgment of 1970 which dealt with allegations against a public servant accused of dishonesty, the bench said that as the Apex court had held that “there must be some suitable preliminary inquiry into the allegations by a responsible officer”, it was directing CBI to conduct a preliminary probe which is to be concluded in 15 days. The court then left it to the discretion of the CBI director to decide on further course of action on the completion of the preliminary inquiry.While restraining CBI from registering an FIR immediately on Patil’s complaint, HC held that as the concerns raised in all the petitions had been addressed, it was not keeping them pending and disposed of the three PILs, the writ petition and an intervention application.‘Constitution envisages rule of law, not rule of goons’ The court in its judgment said, “The rule of law, in terms of the Constitution, pervades over the entire field of administration and every organ of the state is regulated by it. In fact, what the Constitution envisages is a rule of law and not rule of goons having political support. An ordered polity within India to promote the integrity of the country and to enliven liberty, equality and fraternity, which Dr BR Ambedkar was heard to say in the Constituent Assembly, are not to be treated as separate entities but as a trinity, are fundamental principles engrained in the Constitution. This trinity can be bypassed or overlooked only if the fabric of which the Constitution is woven be torn to pieces. Regrettably, for indolent state mechanisms and politicians, this can never happen, for the courts shall not countenance violation of Constitutional principles by anyone, howsoever high an office he occupies... courts would ensure that democratic values are respected.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/cant-remain-a-mute-spectator-bombay-hc-on-pils-against-anil-deshmukh-101617649755040.html

The presence of foreign materials and moisture content in food grains is weather related, and farmers cannot be penalised for it. All conditions including ‘Meri Fasal Mera Byora’ or land revenue records to be withdrawn for purchasing,” he added.Bhiwani farm leader Dayanand Punia said crop procurement should be completed in minimum time. “Government should ensure that farmers do not face any problem due to lack of gunny bags.

Even my arhtiya reached out to mandi officials multiple times, but they did not come to measure the moisture content,” alleged farmer Angrej Singh, who was waiting for buyers at the new grain market in Karnal.Another farmer Krishan Kumar, of Kutail village in Karnal, said, “Following government orders that wheat will be produced without any schedule, I brought my wheat of two acre to the mandi on Sunday but the officials of procurement agencies refused to buy it saying that the moisture content is 13%. Now the officials are saying that the moisture content should be below 12%.”“Even government-approved companies sell their seed with 14% moisture content,” he claimed.As per figures provided by mandi officials, total 9,000 MT wheat is reached grain markets in Karnal and only 871 MT wheat has been procured so far. Almost 90% wheat is lying unsold and of this, 1,100 MT crop is lying unsold in just Karnal grain market.Officials associated with procurement procedure said wheat could not be procured because most of the wheat coming to mandis does not fulfil the criteria as the moisture content is high.Additional chief secretary, Haryana agriculture department, Sumita Misra visited the Karnal grain market to review the procurement operations. She said that the criteria for procurement are fixed by the Centre and the state government cannot change the condition of moisture content.“We examined the moisture content and it was found to be higher than the permissible limits.

Legal experts are also of the opinion that RERA court’s orders must be published within a week of the last hearing of the case like the high court and Supreme Court orders. “Aggrieved home buyers are already suffering at the hands of developers. Delay in publication of the RERA court’s orders is helping defaulter promoters to exploit the situation further to their advantage,” said GS Chauhan, advocate, high court, Lucknow. UP RERA has launched an online e-court system for lodging of complaints against developers. This system of online filing of complaints is effective from February 3 last. Complainants can logon to the www.up-rera.in/ecourts/signup link for filing a complaint. After registration of complaint, a notice is sent to the developer with a deadline of 15 days to respond.

06-04-2021||Mumbai||State, Centre disagree over oxygen supply guidelines||A day after the Maharashtra government directed industrial producers of oxygen to reserve 80% supply for medical and pharmaceutical purposes, the Central government issued an advisory against doing so, stating there is sufficient oxygen supply and the decision would affect the industrial and manufacturing sector. According to data accessed by HT, while the monthly consumption of medical oxygen in the country was around 2,675 metric tonnes in September 2020, it was around 1,459 in March 2021. Guruprasad Mahapatra, secretary, Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade, Government of India, said, “It is advisable not to cut down on supply to industry as long as there is no shortage in manufacturing and availability of oxygen, as that affects various industry sectors.” A note by the ministry also states that, “Overall, there is sufficient stock of medical oxygen in the country, and presently Maharashtra state is also picking up medical oxygen from Bhilai, Chattisgarh for Vidharbha and Nagpur region.” It also states that the demand is “within expectations” and “much lower than the daily oxygen offtake that took place in September 2020.” In its notification ‘Break the Chain’ released on Sunday, Maharashtra government stated that all industrial producers of oxygen should reserve 80% of their production (actual as well as capacity) for medical and pharmaceutical purposes. It also stated that “any industrial profess that is a net consumer of oxygen as a raw material is to be disallowed by default from April 10, 2021 onwards.” If industries are desirous of carrying out such a process, then they will have to seek permission, the notification states. In September 2020, industrial units across Navi Mumbai, Thane, Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad faced acute shortage of oxygen for industrial purposes. Sitaram Kunte, Maharashtra chief secretary, said, “Maharashtra has an installed capacity of 1200 MT, while the production is around 1050 MT. We are already utilising 650 MT of oxygen supply for close to 25,000 cases and the demand is only expected to go up in the coming days as cases increase. We have already conveyed to the ministry that we have to reserve 80% of the supply.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/state-centre-disagree-over-oxygen-supply-guidelines-101617649456365.html

The state has mandated that all shops, barring essential services, would be closed from 8pm on Monday till April 30 at 11.59pm. The Chamber of Association of Maharashtra Industries and Trade (CAMIT) has demanded compensation for this closure. “Small traders will be destroyed by this closure. Traders from Maharashtra will have to bear the brunt as other states will steal our businesses. If the government still wants to go ahead, they need to compensate us with salaries of our workers and business losses as well as waiver in property taxes,” said Mohan Gurnani, chairman, CAMIT. Traders affiliated to the Federation of Retail Traders Welfare Association (FRTWA) will put up banners opposing the closure as well as submit memorandums to local public representatives. The All India Electronics Association (AIEA) has condemned the move saying the closure will break the back bone of the economy. “We don’t mind stricter norms but allow us to open our shops. The government has allowed hotels to give deliveries, public transport to operate and film shootings. Why are they preventing traders from opening shops,” asked Mitesh Mody, president, AIEA.

It will help us test, trace and treat and with this the growth rate will automatically come down. This is proved globally and locally that the cases will come down with lockdown. However, I cannot give a date, but in the coming days we will get to see the change.”Further, the BMC on Monday issued a circular due to which visitors will now not be allowed to enter BMC headquarters and ward offices unless of some emergency work.

Post this, Chahal called up the relative. Later, the BMC in a tweet, said, “Ma’am. Hope you got clarity on a call from our Municipal Commissioner Mr Chahal, on how you violating the protocol led to all the confusion. We request all Mumbaikars to contact respective war rooms or 1916 - we have enough beds vacant and no one needs to go through this chase.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-records-9-879-new-cases-21-deaths-101617649275614.html

06-04-2021||Delhi||Amid rise in Covid-19 cases, Delhi govt orders increase in hospital beds||With hospital beds earmarked for the treatment of Covid-19 patients filling up fast, the Delhi government has ordered 11 government and 54 private hospitals of the national capital to increase the number of beds, orders issued by the Delhi government stated on Monday. This will add 1,540 beds in the government sector and 3,297 beds in the private sector. Of these, 1,073 beds will be in the intensive care unit (ICU).“The positivity rate and the number of active cases in Delhi was 2.71% and 8,838 on 31.03.2021 respectively. The same increased to 4.67% and 13,982, respectively on 04.04.2021. The occupancy of COVID ICU and ward beds across 33 private hospitals has increased markedly and the overall occupancy of COVID ICU beds and COVID ward beds in these hospitals on 05.04.2021 was 78% and 68% respectively,” read the order from Dr RN Das, medical superintendent, Delhi’s Nursing Home Cell.City’s private hospitals have been asked to reserve at least 30% of their total ward and ICU capacity or double the number of beds occupied on April 5, whichever is higher, the order stated. “Every day we are freeing up more and more beds for Covid-19 patients. Last year, all non-emergency surgeries were put on hold. Patients were anyway not coming to the hospitals because of the Covid-19 scare. Now, even the non-Covid services are running at about 70 to 80% of what it was before Covid-19,” said Dr Suranjit Chatterjee, senior consultant, internal medicine, Indraprastha Apollo. Dr Rommel Tickoo, director of internal medicine, Max Healthcare, said, “The cases are rising exponentially. The pace at which the number of cases went up this time around did not give us any time to ramp up the capacity. The situation is heading towards what it was during November.” The occupancy of beds was high across various major private hospitals – 82.4% at Indraprastha Apollo, 88.1% at Sir Ganga Ram hospital, and 70.6% at Max hospital, Saket. Among government hospital, Lok Nayak Hospital was directed to increase the number of Covid-19 beds from 300 to 1,000, with the number of ICU beds increasing from 50 to 200. The hospital was the first Delhi government-run centre to be designated as a Covid-19 centre in March last year after which all 2,000 of its beds were earmarked for the treatment of the viral infection. “We have received the order to increase the number of beds, we will have to move some patients around but we have as many beds available at the moment. We have a capacity of 2,000 beds and there are only 700 non-Covid patients admitted at the moment. The medicine and casualty blocks will be reserved for Covid-19 patients,” said a senior administrator from the hospital. Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital, where none of the beds was earmarked for Covid-19 as the number of cases went down, has been asked to increase the number of beds to 500, with 100 beds in the ICU. “Logistics required, if any, may be sourced by using powers delegated under section 50 of the Disaster Management Act,” read the order by SM Ali, special secretary (health). This is the second time when the Kejriwal government has directed to increase the number of beds across some of the major private hospitals within the week. On March 31, 33 major private hospitals of the city were asked to add 1,080 beds. This comes as the city witnessed a sudden jump in the number of new Covid-19 cases recently.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/amid-rise-in-covid-19-cases-delhi-govt-orders-increase-in-hospital-beds-101617649216292.html

06-04-2021||Mumbai||Allow citizens above 25 to get vax, CM requests PM||Amid the spike in Covid-19 cases, Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Monday requested Prime Minister Narendra Modi to allow people above 25 years of age to receive the vaccine. In a letter to Modi, Thackeray said if a large number of the working population is vaccinated, “the intensity of the cases would be lower than the treatment that they need today.” Currently, those above 45 years of age are eligible for vaccination. A day after the Maharashtra government announced restrictions to curb the spread of Covid-19 in the state, Maharashtra on Monday recorded more than 40,000 cases with 47,288 new infections and 155 more deaths, taking the state’s tally to 3,057,885 and toll to 56,033. Mumbai continued to be the highest contributor to the daily caseload with 9,879 new cases and 21 deaths on Monday.The state has 451,375 active cases, with the highest in Pune (81,378) and Mumbai (73,281). In the past two days, Maharashtra has recorded 104,362 new cases, while Mumbai has recorded 21,085 cases.Other cities like Pune, Nashik and Nagpur also recorded 4,250, 2,647 and 2,556 new Covid-19 cases on Monday. Meanwhile, the state government on Monday issued a new notification, putting some more services such as petrol pumps, fruit vendors, government and private security agencies in its list of essential services. Also, people coming from or going to the airport or railway terminus for outstation travel are exempted from night curfew. They have also been exempted from the weekend lockdown, provided they are carrying a valid ticket. Lawyers’ offices have also been exempted from closure. Similarly domestic helps/drivers and cooks can work in the day. With regards to them working after 8pm or on weekends, local authorities will decide the same. Students appearing physically for exams would be allowed to travel in the night curfew or weekends, provided they are carrying valid hall tickets. Wine shops will be closed, so liquor will be available in bars and restaurants through parcels. Further, the BMC issued a circular due to which visitors will now not be allowed to enter BMC headquarters and ward offices unless for some emergency. According to the circular, visitors will also be issued a pass, including contractors, consultant and other vendors, in case they can show their negative report. According to officials, all restrictions announced by the state will be implemented in the city, however, on certain issues, the BMC is expected to issue a clarification by Tuesday. Earlier, Thackeray, in his letter to Modi, also requested for additional vaccine doses for six districts facing a surge.He wrote, “Maharashtra has also requested for additional doses so that six districts facing the surge of Covid can be covered on priority and in greater speed. Mumbai, Pune, Thane, Nashik, Nagpur and Aurangabad can be covered in a matter of three weeks, for the population of above 45, if 1.5 crore doses are made available to the state by the government of India.”He also stated that Maharashtra is the number one state in the country in terms of number of doses administered. “As of Sunday, 4th April 2021, we have administered 76.86 lakh doses of Covid vaccine, which is highest in the country,” Thackeray wrote. He also apprised Modi of the “break the chain” initiative taken by the state government to curb the spread. The state government Sunday issued directives for a partial lockdown in the state from 8pm on Monday to April 30, owing to the alarming increase in cases. Besides a complete lockdown on weekends, a strict night curfew of 11 hours, and prohibition of gatherings of more than five people during the day, the state announced shutting down of shops and establishments dealing in non-essential commodities, restaurants, eateries, malls, theatres, multiplexes, and religious places.However, the decision is being opposed by many shop-owners in the city. Viren Shah from the federation of retail traders welfare association said that the members had detailed discussion on Monday regarding the notification. “We oppose the decision of closing down non-essential shops without any subsidy being offered. Our representatives will be meeting all government authorities to register our protest in the next few days,” Shah said. However, experts said the health infrastructure in the state is already burdened and the measures will help contain the spread. Dr Shashank Joshi, a member of the state-appointed task force, said that the directives should help in improving the situation in the next two-four weeks. However, it depends upon enforcement of the guidelines at the local level and co-operation by citizens.“There is still a large invisible pool of suspected and asymptomatic Covid patients in the state. These measures are to identify these patients and ensure micro-containment so they do not become super-spreaders. Our health infrastructure is already burdened. People have to co-operate by following appropriate Covid behaviour,” Dr Joshi said.Meanwhile, the state government has issued a new notification, putting some more services as essential — petrol pumps, data centers, fruit vendors etc. Also, the people coming or going to airport or railway stations for outstation travel, too, are exempted from the night curfew.Moreover, the Central government has constituted 50 high level multi-disciplinary public health teams, highest so far, to be deployed to 50 districts across Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh and Punjab owing to the ‘recent very large numbers of daily new coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases and daily mortality being consistently reported by these States’. “The teams are being rushed to 30 districts of Maharashtra, 11 districts of Chhattisgarh and 9 districts of Punjab to assist the State Health Department and local authorities,” said Union health ministry in a statement issued on Monday.The teams are ordered to reach their respective allotted states latest by April 7, and before that the centre has also scheduled an orientation session on April 6. Kunak Kumar, ministry of housing and urban affairs is the nodal officer for Maharashtra.

06-04-2021||Mumbai||Air India Boeing pilots seek urgent meeting with aviation minister over pay cut||Air India’s Boeing pilots have written to the aviation minister Hardeep Singh Puri seeking an urgent meeting with him. The letter dated March 31 emphasised that Air India group flew over 2.9 million passengers through the pandemic as frontliners, yet since April 2020, an “illegal pay cut” has been forcefully implemented upon them which no other public sector undertaking (PSU) has undergone.“…effective April 2020, a unilateral and illegal pay cut has been forcefully implemented upon us...throughout the pandemic no other PSU has undergone such a drastic pay cut. Air India awarded a 70% pay cut to the very section of employees who during Covid times reported for duty, putting themselves as well as their near and dear ones at risk of getting infected. At the same time the management gave themselves a paltry 10% cut while effectively being cocooned in the safety of their own homes,” the letter stated.The pilots had written to their management on March 23 highlighting factors such as the airline management’s decisions to remove pre-flight Covid testing and cancel or curtail pilot leaves. They also questioned the government on not rolling back their pay cuts despite seeing a rise in domestic travel.Air India did not comment on the matter.A pilot said, “In our recent letter to our CMD Shri Rajiv Bansal dated March 23, we highlighted several factors such as the Air India management’s decisions to remove pre-flight Covid testing, cancel or curtail pilot leaves and, the most recent one, to discontinue providing all meals to pilots in rooms at domestic hotels. These strategic and intentional decisions of the management are a clear indication that they believe that the worst is behind us.”They pointed out the steady return of the aviation sector towards normalcy, despite which their wages continue to be paid out with the 70% pay cut.“We strongly urge you to intervene and roll back this unilateral and illegal pay cut enforced on the licensed category of Air India’s employees as of January 1, 2021 in line with other Indian airlines. At this crucial juncture of the government’s efforts to privatise Air India, we reach out to you with a lot of apprehensions about our arrears, wages and service conditions which have not been addressed since 2006. We request you to grant us an audience at the earliest,” the letter concluded.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/air-india-boeing-pilots-seek-urgent-meeting-with-aviation-minister-over-pay-cut-101617649035587.html

The imitations are made out of waste and are part of the ‘Waste to Art’ project of the authority, officials said. “The authority often conducts encroachment drives across the city’s footpaths and other public places, which result in the generation of a lot of waste. All such pieces of wood shards, metal bolts and other such things have been used to create the installations,” said Anand Mohan Singh from the Noida authority’s horticulture department. The installations were recently inspected by the authority’s chief executive officer, Ritu Maheshwari. “Some finishing touches are required at the installations. The platform of the Sarnath Stupa installation needs to be raised. I have also instructed officials to increase the number of lights that have been put inside the structures,” said Maheshwari. The aim of the ‘Waste to Art’ project is three-pronged, said Maheshwari. “Our first aim is to project Noida as the gateway of Uttar Pradesh, so we are trying to display heritage places of the state through these structures. Secondly, we want to attract tourists to Noida and project it as an upcoming destination for investors. Thirdly, we want to promote the habit of recycling and waste management which everyone should follow in their daily lives,” she said. She added that these installations have been designed by the same artist who created Delhi’s Waste to Wonder park. “The installations have been created as part of a company’s corporate social responsibility project,” Maheshwari said, adding that a waste to wonder park in the city is also in the pipeline. “We are planning a theme park in Noida which will have artifacts of UP’s heritage sites made out of waste. However, the project is still in its initial stages and will take another two-three months to materialise,” she said. The Noida CEO added that 10 more such installations are being planned along the Noida-Greater Noida expressway as well. “We have planned 10 more such installations depicting tourist and heritage sites of UP to be installed along the Noida expressway. We are looking for firms to come forward and take those up as part of their CSR,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/waste-to-art-imitations-of-sarnath-stupa-taj-mahal-and-ganga-ghat-installed-at-mahamaya-flyover-in-noida-101617647834970.html

The officials also said that the ambulance service will be made available centrally through its emergency response centre (ERC) based at Lucknow. On July 30 last year, a cap of 50% was announced for the ambulances under the ‘108 service’ for ferrying Covid patients. However, the order was modified on February 9 this year in which 10% of ‘108’ ambulances were to be used as the Covid cases had started to decline. However, with the spike in cases in March, another order was issued on March 24 in which the usage was fixed at 25%, while the respective district magistrates were authorised to give permission for usage above the limit under extraordinary circumstances. “The latest order states that all the ‘108’ ambulances could be used in emergency situations, including ferrying Covid patients. A meeting to this effect was also held on Sunday,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate. The Ghaziabad district at present has 16 ambulances under the ‘108 service’ and five advanced life-support (ALS) ambulances at its disposal. “The latest directions mean that all the ‘108’ and ALS ambulances will be available for emergency services, including for ferrying Covid patients. However, they will be operated through the ERC at Lucknow through information given by the district’s Integrated Covid Command and Control Centre. Earlier, an officer from the health department was coordinating for arranging ambulances at district level,” said an officer from the district health department. The latest order further said that one attendant will be allowed with Covid-19 positive patient in an ambulance, and both will be provided triple layered mask and hand gloves. It also said that supplementary oxygen therapy will be given to a Covid patient when required and the entire ambulance will be disinfected as per protocol after transportation of patients. According to the state control room records, Ghaziabad on Monday recorded 46 Covid-19 cases. With this, the district has now 397 active cases.

As a result, the vaccination centres of the district on Monday were overcrowded and as many as 10,327 people took their jabs, which is the highest number of vaccination in a single day so far, officials said. Dr Neeraj Tyagi, district in-charge of vaccination, said that as per the earlier government order, the vaccination was scheduled for all seven days in the district. “But the order was amended on April 2 that vaccination will be done six days a week (except Sunday) in government hospitals. However, due to some technical glitches, the Co-Win portal remained open on Sunday and over 500 people reached different vaccination centres after their registration. However, they realised that it was not the fault of district health department and agreed to be vaccinated on Monday,” he said. Tyagi further said that due to beneficiaries’ registration on Sunday and Monday, as many as 10,327 people received their jabs on Monday. “It is the highest number of vaccination in a day so far. To avert an overcrowding situation and longer waiting time, we had increased the vaccination centres in the district from 75 (on Saturday) to 83 today that included 42 government hospitals,” he said. The last time GB Nagar had crossed the 10,000 vaccinations was April 2, when 10,111 beneficiaries were inoculated.Meanwhile, the district, which was left with only about 8,000 doses of Covid-19 vaccine on Saturday, received 15,000 vials of vaccines on Monday, the officials said. GB Nagar district magistrate Suhas LY on Monday directed that the monitoring of all the containment zones should be intensified. “As per the new state guidelines, if one Covid-19 case comes on a floor of a multi-storey building, the entire floor will be declared as a containment zone. If more than one floor comes under scrutiny, then the entire building will be converted into a containment zone,” he said. As per the state government’s order, containment zones are redefined for the purposes of “medical surveillance activity”. In such areas, medical teams shall track contacts of Covid-19 patients and symptomatic persons for the purposes of testing and isolation (of positive cases), so that chain of infection is broken, the officials said.“There shall be no sealing or stopping of movement of persons. However, it is advised to the residents living in containment zones/areas to exercise self-restraint and to follow all Covid protocols,” said the DM in a statement released on Monday.Expressing satisfaction over the work being done by home isolation cell in the integrated Covid-19 control room in sector 59, the DM said that the cell is keeping round-the-clock monitoring of health conditions of the home isolated persons. “The home isolation cell has 21 operators, four doctors and a nodal officer. They are keeping a close tab on the persons, who have recently travelled to foreign countries in the recent past. As per the cell’s records, there are altogether 283 international travellers in the district, including 236 from the United Kingdom, 26 from South Africa, 13 from Dubai, seven from Brazil and one from the USA,” Suhas said. The additional chief medical officer, Dr Lalit Kumar, who is the nodal officer of the home isolation cell, said that at present, the district has 250 Covid-19 positive patients, who have been granted home isolation. “We call them at least thrice in a day to know their temperature, oxygen level and other symptoms. Besides, the cell receives at least 150 in-bound calls from different persons about the symptoms of Covid-19 and criteria to get permission for home isolation,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/cowins-error-results-in-highest-inoculation-in-a-day-in-noida-101617647714914.html
06-04-2021||Delhi||Delhi police probe allegation of custodial brutality||The Delhi Police are probing an allegation of custodial excesses at Shahbad Dairy police station, after a 46-year-old scrap dealer, who was suspected to be involved in the sale of stolen copper scrap, filed a complaint with senior police officers.Rajeev Ranjan, the deputy commissioner of police (outer-north), confirmed the initiation of an inquiry, but said he would share the findings and comment on the merits of the allegations only once it was completed. “A thorough and independent inquiry is being conducted. It is in its advanced stage,” said Ranjan.The scrap dealer, Jagaram Chaudhary, was taken in for questioning after his name was revealed by another suspect in a case of copper scrap being siphoned off during a scrap trade.A resident of Shahdara in east Delhi, Chaudhary has been in the scrap trade for three decades and is assisted by his nephew, Dinesh.Chaudhary, who claims innocence in the theft case, alleged that on March 28, he was subjected to brutality by three policemen at the Shahbad Dairy police station after arriving there to be questioned in the theft case.On March 30, Chaudhary contacted a lawyer and sent his complaint to senior police officers, the lieutenant governor, and a host of other officials.

06-04-2021||Delhi||Private school shut after 7 students test Covid-positive||At least seven students of Arya Kanya Gurukul in New Rajinder Nagar tested positive for Covid-19 following which the institute was shut on Monday until further orders, school officials said. Another private school in west Delhi on Monday cancelled a scheduled exam after a class 12 student tested positive for the virus.According to officials at the Gurukul, around 16 students were taken for testing on April 1 to a government mohalla clinic after they displayed Covid-like symptoms. Usha Sareen, manager of the gurukul, said, “None of our students tested positive in the rapid antigen testing. So, we sent them for RT-PCR testing, the results of which arrived on Sunday. Seven students were positive and six of them have returned to their homes, while one is quarantined at the school. We are closely monitoring the student and taking all precautions.”The school, which is operated by women’s group Pranti Arya Mahila Association, offers education from class 4 to class 12. “Around 130 students have been staying on-campus since last December. The president of mahila association had first tested positive and hospitalised. Some students, who had come in her contact, later developed symptoms. We have sent all students back to their homes. We have sanitised the gurukul and closed it until further orders,” Sareen said.With Covid-19 cases are on the rise in the national capital, several schools have reported incidents of staff and students testing positive for Covid. A private school in west Delhi on Monday cancelled a scheduled exam after a class 12 student tested positive. In a message sent to parents on Sunday, the school said, “Due to some unforeseen circumstance, the class 12 improvement test of physics and accountancy scheduled on April 5 stands cancelled.” The school has advised students who came in contact with the student concerned to get themselves tested before coming back to the campus.In Delhi, only students enrolled in classes 9 to 12 for the academic session 2020-21 have been allowed to come to schools for practicals, remedial classes, and exams.Meanwhile, the principal and some staff members of another private school, DAV Sreshta Vihar, have also tested positive for Covid-19. An official at the school said, “The principal and other staff members are in quarantine at their homes. They have not visited the school in the past eight days. We are taking all Covid-19 appropriate precautions as students are coming to school for the ongoing practical exams.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/seven-students-of-arya-kanya-gurukul-contracts-covid-another-private-school-cancels-exam-after-a-student-is-positive-101617647417961.html
06-04-2021||Other||One killed, 2 hurt in three firing incidents in outer Delhi||New DelhiOne person was killed and two others, including a Delhi University (DU) student, were shot at in three separate incidents reported from different parts of outer Delhi between Saturday night and Monday morning, police said. While both the attempt to murder cases have been solved, the police are yet to make breakthroughs in the murder case.In the near fatal attack on the DU student, the police said, they have arrested three men, including the brother of the student’s female friend. In the other case, two minor boys were apprehended for trying to kill a 31-year-old property dealer, investigators said.On Monday, around 9.30am, the Mangolpuri police station received information about a man’s body, with his throat slit, lying in a public park in West Enclave near Mangolpuri. The man was later identified as Chandrabhan (single name), a resident of L-block in Mangolpuri, who painted houses for a living. A murder case was registered and investigations launched, said deputy commissioner of police (outer) Parvinder Singh.Police said that through Chandrabhan’s family members they have so far learnt about his relationship with a woman living in Mangolpuri with whom he was planning to get married. The family also told the police that Chandrabhan had left home with some people in a black car on Sunday evening.“Prime facie, it appears that the killers were known to Chandrabhan. We are probing the case from all possible angles, including that of personal enmity,” added the DCP.Around 12 hours before Chandrabhan’s body was discovered, an 18-year-old student of DU’s Swami Shradhanand College was shot twice after three men riding a bike opened fire at him with two pistols outside his home in Nehru Enclave near Alipur. As many as five bullets were fired. The first-year student, Karan Thapa, was admitted to Baba Saheb Ambedkar hospital, where his condition is still serious, the police said.Initial investigation into the attempt to murder case revealed that one of the attackers, Vikrant alias Nonu, 21, was the brother of the woman with whom the college student was friends. Vikrant did not like Thapa talking to his sister, so he roped in two of his friends, Vikas Pandey and Ashish, both 24, and fired at Thapa while he was sitting with his friends near his home, said DCP (outer-north) Rajiv Ranjan Singh.According to the police, the firing incident took place around 9.30 pm on Sunday and the three suspects were arrested on Monday from different places in Alipur. Two pistols and a bike that were used in the crime were recovered, along with three cartridges, the police said.In another firing incident, 31-year-old property dealer, Jitender alias Kaku, was shot at by two persons known to him near his home in Kirari near Aman Vihar on Saturday night. Two minors, aged between 16 and 17 years, were apprehended and two pistols recovered from them within an hour of the crime, the police said.“The attack was the result of a personal enmity. Kaku had earlier been booked for two crimes,” said DCP (Rohini) Pranav Tayal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/one-killed-2-hurt-in-three-firing-incidents-in-outer-delhi-101617647416838.html
06-04-2021||Delhi||Mall visitors shrug off Covid-appropriate behaviours||Despite the surge in Covid-19 infections in the city, citizens continue to display laxity towards appropriate and safe behaviours in public spaces, such as malls and markets. During a spot check by HT at some popular malls on Monday, many visitors were seen not wearing masks while a few among those wearing one did not do so appropriately.At Select Citywalk mall, lack of mask discipline was the main concern, as visitors maintained sufficient distance from one another after announcements were made through a public address system.A few shopkeepers HT spoke to said that social distancing was not a problem as the footfall was declining due to the recent surge in cases. However, they said that most visitors remove their masks while clicking pictures and failed to put them back.Yogeshwar Sharma, chief executive officer and executive director, Select Citywalk, said that Covid-19 protocols at the mall were enforced rigorously since the lockdown ended last year. “We have always stressed on mandatory wearing of masks for all visitors, retailers, and staff at all points, as well as regular disinfection of all public spaces. We have strived to educate all visitors on our Covid-19 protocols, and will continue to do, as a part of increased vigilance,” said Sharma.At V3S mall in Laxmi Nagar, staff members were stationed at the entry gate to carry out thermal checks and sanitise visitors. However, visitors were not following physical distancing norms and many of them did not cover their mouth and nostrils with the mask. Many were also seen sitting in clusters on the mall courtyard.A few shopkeepers HT spoke to expressed concern over the lack of appropriate behaviour but said their businesses cannot survive another hit, as witnessed during last year’s lockdown.Visitors at the mall, who were seen flouting the mask rules, said that they had taken them off while clicking pictures and failed to put them back on.Despite efforts, the V3S mall administration couldn’t be reached for comment.Police officials said that around 20 fines were issued outside the V3S mall premises every day. “People start wearing masks when they see us approaching. Unless told, they do not wear the mask. We first click a picture and then ask them to pay the fine. If they create a nuisance or resist, we take them to a police station and take appropriate action under section 188 of the IPC,” said assistant sub-inspector Sohnveer, Preet Vihar police station.The deputy commissioner of police (east), Deepak Yadav, said that they were prosecuting people and owners of business establishments for violating the Covid-19 guidelines under a carpet challan system. “Under this initiative, we send multiple teams to shopping malls, banquet halls, restaurants, nightclubs or other public places for surprise checks or after receiving inputs regarding mass violations of Covid-19 guidelines. Our prosecution has doubled in the past few days. We also carry out awareness campaigns at such places and educate people about the rules and punishments,” said Yadav.Officials of the Shopping Centres Association of India (SCAI), an umbrella body, said that they were continually pursuing members across the retail spectrum to ensure that comprehensive guidelines were strictly followed to curb the spread of the virus. “We are deeply concerned with the second wave of Covid across the country. Whether it be allowing one person in 75 sq ft of space, having a technological solution for density checks, regular checks on visitors and partners following all Covid-appropriate behaviours, frequent sanitisation of commonly touched points etc., the shopping malls industry has been strengthening protocols to ensure the safety of consumers, retailers, and staff members,” said SCAI officials, in a written statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/mall-visitors-shrug-off-covid-appropriate-behaviours-101617647415585.html
06-04-2021||Delhi||St Stephen’s to reopen today, two blocks to stay shut||Four days after 13 students and two staff members of Delhi University’s St. Stephen’s tested positive for Covid-19, the college on Monday said it will reopen its entire campus, barring two blocks, from Tuesday. Students who tested positive for Covid-19 have been quarantined in two separate buildings in these blocks.The college came under scanner after it was found out that the students and staff had tested positive after their return from a college trip on March 31.Sub-divisional magistrate of Civil Lines Rajesh Chaudhary said, “All positive patients have been isolated and others have been tested as well. Further contact tracing and testing will be continued as per guidelines in this regard. Normal working has been allowed to be resumed subject to strict observance of Covid appropriate behaviour,” he said.Principal John Varghese said on Monday, “On the basis of site visits, Covid tests done and test results received, the SDM, Civil Lines has notified Mukherji East in Extension Block and the Sports Complex for strict perimeter control and necessary procedures for containment of Covid-19.” He added that these two blocks will be “out of bounds for all” with effect from April 5 and “until further notice.”“Other areas of the college campus will be open for routine work with effect from April ,6 following all Covid safety measures and faculty and staff may return to normal duties as per routine,” he said.A first-year student and hosteller, requesting anonymity, said, “We were worried after 13 students tested positive. Some of those interacted with us, had meals, and shared rooms while they carried the virus. The situation is better now and testing has been initiated. Now, we have a volunteer team who take packed food to those isolated in the two blocks.”Until the incident, teachers were using the college to hold staggered classes for hostel residents and local Delhi students and to conduct online lessons. “We had been planning to start blended offline-online classes for our students after Easter. But that doesn’t look possible now. A lot of students and teachers don’t have the confidence to try and hold in-person classes because it would be too risky due to the surge in cases again,” said Nandita Narain, who teaches Mathematics in the college.Principal Varghese said the college had conducted a Covid test for all resident students, housekeeping and mess staff on Saturday and all were found to be Covid-negative.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/st-stephen-s-to-reopen-today-two-blocks-to-stay-shut-101617647416177.html
06-04-2021||Delhi||Delhi CM Kejriwal asks PM Modi to remove age caps for Covid vaccinations||Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal has written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi urging him to remove age-related restrictions for the ongoing vaccination drive and ease protocols for starting new vaccine sites, in the light of the resurgence of Covid-19 cases across the country, the chief minister’s office said in a press statement issued on Monday. The state government also ordered its hospitals to run one-third of their inoculation sites 24x7.“The increase in the rate of transmission of Corona across the country has presented new concerns and challenges. The vaccination campaign needs to move more rapidly in this context. If rules for opening new centres are simplified and everyone is allowed to be vaccinated irrespective of age, then the Delhi government can vaccinate all Delhi residents within three months. In the fight against Corona, the Delhi government has had the support of the Centre at every step,” said the statement citing Kejriwal’s letter to Modi.The test positivity rate crossed the 5% mark on Monday for the first time in 124 days as the fourth wave continued to surge in the Capital. The World Health Organization recommends a positivity rate below 5% for an infection to be considered under control.“Now you can get Covid vaccine anytime in Delhi. Beneficiaries should come forward and get the shot. We will not let there be a shortage of facilities,” said Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal in a tweet.Two weeks ago, all Delhi government hospitals were asked to open six vaccination sites and run them for 12 hours between 9 am and 9 pm.“One-third of the vaccination sites in all the Delhi government hospitals will also function from 9pm to 9am,” read the latest order by S Sunil, deputy secretary of Delhi’s health and family welfare department.On Thursday, Kejriwal, in a press briefing, ruled out the possibility of a lockdown or curbs in Delhi at this stage, even though he admitted that a “fourth wave” of the Covid-19 pandemic is raging in the Capital. He also asserted that the government will scale up its strategies on test, tracing, containment and vaccination, even as he appealed to people to take all necessary precautions.“We must move the vaccination campaign forward in a more swift manner. This needs to be done at two levels. First, there is an urgent need to increase the number of vaccination centres. For this, the pre-conditions placed by the Centre regarding vaccination centres need to be relaxed. For example, according to the central government’s instructions, vaccination centres can only be set up in hospitals or dispensaries. Initially, this was done to ensure that if someone had an adverse reaction to the vaccine, they could be treated immediately in the hospital. The vaccination drive in the last three months has shown that the vaccine is safe. It is, therefore, requested that this condition be removed so that large-scale vaccination centers can be built in schools, community centers, and other places… The Delhi government will ensure that it takes all necessary precautions. In this instance, for example, arrangements for ambulances, etc, will be made at every centre,” said Monday’s statement, citing Kejriwal’s letter to Modi.“It [the vaccine] should be made available to everyone by removing the age limit to immunisation,” the statement continued.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/kejriwal-asks-pm-to-remove-age-caps-for-covid-vaccinations-101617647414942.html
06-04-2021||Delhi||Calls grow for fee waiver for EWS students till class 12||The debate on extending free education up to class 12 to economically weaker section (EWS) students of private schools has risen once again with parents of several class 9 students saying they have been told to pay the school fee from this academic year.Many parents said the demand is like a bolt from the blue and the fee of approximately over ₹7,000 a month is beyond them as they earn only about that much or less in a month.The Right to Education (RTE) Act mandates that 25% of seats in entry-level classes (kindergarten and class 1) at private school be reserved for EWS and disadvantage groups (DG) students. It guarantees free education to such children till the completion of class 8 and the state and central governments reimburses schools a fixed amount towards this.In the past few days, several private schools in Delhi have sent out letters to parents of class 9 students asking them to pay fee from this academic session, on a par with general category students, or leave the school.When the first batch of EWS students completed class 8 in 2019 in Delhi, parents and educationists had demand that free education be extended till class 12. But no state has extended it till now.As per Delhi school education rules, private schools on government land have to provide free education to EWS students up to class 12. But, there is no such compulsion on schools on private land.Advocate and president of All India Parents Association Ashok Agarwal had filed a PIL in the Delhi high court demanding the extension of free education till class 12 in 2019. “The Centre had last month informed the court that it is not considering an extension. Who will take responsibility for the children already enrolled under RTE? The centre and state governments should come together to amend the RTE Act and extend it up to the senior-most class that a school offers. Meanwhile, the state governments can also reimburse schools for students who have reached class 9 and are struggling to pay the fee,” he said.A senior official of the Delhi government, who asked not to be named, said the decision of extending the free education till class 12 cannot be taken by a state government unilaterally. “Presently, central and state governments are sharing the reimbursement cost paid to schools under the RTE Act in a 60:40 ratio. If the state takes any decision of extending the Act, it will have to bear the entire cost. So, any decision of extending the Act will be taken either by amending the Act or on a mutual understanding between governments on how to share the cost,” the official said.Meanwhile, parents are left to endure the uncertainty and worry about raising the fee.For instance, NC Jindal Public School in Punjabi Bagh sent letters (HT has seen them) to parents of over 50 EWS students on March 20 and told them to pay the fee by April 10.“You’ll also be required to furnish an undertaking that you will continue to do so in the future also. In case you fail to inform that you are willing to pay the fees of your ward as per the general category students or fail to respond to this letter, the name of your ward will stand struck off from the school register with effect from March 31, 2021,” the letter read.The father of a class 9 student at the school, who asked not to be named, alleged that his son had not been able to join his online classes. “The school never told us that our child would be transferred to the general category after class 8. We have no means to pay (the fee of) ₹7,000 a month. It’s more than half my monthly salary. I don’t know what to do. I am thinking of taking a loan for my son’s education now,” he said.School principal DK Pandey did not respond to calls, messages and emails seeking comment.Another school in west Delhi, Hansraj Model School, sent a similar letter to parents of over 100 EWS students and told them to pay the fee by April 15.The mother of a class 9 student at that school, requesting anonymity, said, “My husband works at a tea shop and by no means will we be able to pay the fee of a private school. We have no option but to shift him to a government school, though he is totally against it. He started crying when we told him that we are planning to change his school.”School principal Heemal Handu Bhat did not respond to calls, messages and emails seeking comment.Parents of both these schools had protested against the letters and submitted a memorandum to the Delhi lieutenant-governor demanding an extension of free education up to class 12 on Friday.In the past two years, while some parents have already transferred their wards from private to government schools, others have been trying to arrange money by whatever means possible.The father of a class 10 student at St Thomas School, Dwarka, said the school had withheld his son’s class 9 results. “Last year, when he started class 9, the lockdown had been imposed and the school did not ask us for money. It was in October that we got to know that my son had been transferred to the general category and we were supposed to pay the fee. I somehow managed to pay the fee for two months after which he was allowed to appear for the exams. Now the school has asked me to pay the fee dues in order to release his results,” he said.When contacted, school principal Menaka Singh said in an email response: “We would like to state that as in the past, our school continues to comply with the RTE Act, Delhi School Education Act, and all other applicable laws. We have no further comment.”Among those who have been forced to switch to a government school in class 9 was Kavyanshi, a resident of Tilak Nagar. Her parents shifted her to a government school last October after failing to pay her private school fee. “I am still trying to adjust with my new teachers and classmates. It feels like my entire world has changed,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/no-free-education-from-class-9-parents-of-ews-students-in-pvt-schools-worried-about-paying-fee-101617647357508.html
06-04-2021||Delhi||Govt orders additional 4,857 beds in hospitals as cases surge||With an eye on the surge in Covid-19 cases in the city, the Delhi government on Monday ordered 11 of its hospitals to add 1,540 beds and 54 private ones to add 3,317 beds for these patients. Just over 1,000 of these would be for intensive care, according to the government.This was the second time in a week that the government moved to increase the number of beds in major private hospitals. HT reviewed occupancy rate at private hospitals to find that several had already reached close to 80%.On March 31, 33 major hospitals had been told to add 1,080 beds for Covid patients as the city witnessed a sudden jump in the number of new Covid-19 cases, almost doubling between March 31 and April 3. These hospitals were covered once again in Monday’s order from Dr RN Das, medical superintendent of Delhi’s Nursing Home Cell.“The positivity rate and number of active cases in Delhi was 2.71% and 8,838 respectively on March 31. The same has increased to 4.67% and 13,982, respectively by April 4,” read the order. Monday’s numbers, 3,548 fresh cases on the back of 64,003 tests, pushed the positivity rate up to 5.54%, the first time it breached 5% since December 3.“In order to augment the bed capacity for Covid-19 patients and at the same time to also ensure that treatment of non-Covid critical patients is not compromised, 54 large private hospitals having bed strength of 100 beds or more are directed to reserve at least 30% of their ICU bed capacity or double the occupancy as on April 5, whichever is higher and 30% of their ward bed capacity or double the occupancy as on April 5, whichever is higher for Covid related treatment,” the order further read.The order translates to an additional 4,857 beds.“Every day we are opening up additional beds for Covid-19. Last year, all non-emergency surgeries had been halted and patients were anyway not coming to hospitals because of the Covid-19 scare. Now, non-Covid services are running at about 70 to 80% of what it did before Covid-19,” said Dr Suranjit Chatterjee, senior consultant for internal medicine at Indraprastha Apollo.Dr Rommel Tickoo, director of internal medicine, at Max Healthcare said, “The cases are rising exponentially. The pace at which the number of cases has gone up this time around did not give us time to ramp up capacity. The situation is heading towards what it was during November.”During a check, HT found that the occupancy of beds was high at some big private hospitals – 82.4% at Indraprastha Apollo, 88.1% at Sir Ganga Ram hospital, and 70.6% at Max hospital-Saket.Among the government hospital, Lok Nayak was directed to increase the number of Covid-19 beds from 300 to 1,000, with the number of ICU beds increasing from 50 to 200. Lok Nayak was the first Delhi government-run centre to be designated as a Covid-19 centre in March last year, after which all 2,000 of its beds were earmarked for only the treatment of the viral infection.“We have received the order to increase the number of beds. We will just have to move some patients around but we have the requisite number of beds available at the moment. We have a capacity of 2,000 beds and there are only 700 non-Covid patients admitted at the moment. The medicine and casualty blocks will be reserved for Covid-19 patients,” said a senior administrator from Lok Nayak hospital.Guru Teg Bahadur hospital, where none of the beds were earmarked for the infection, has now been asked to reserve 500 Covid beds, with 100 of them being in the ICU.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/govt-orders-additional-4-857-beds-in-hospitals-as-cases-surge-101617647356280.html
06-04-2021||Delhi||Karol Bagh traders oppose pedestrianisation move||Citing that sales had halved since the pedestrianisation of the Karol Bagh main market road was reintroduced on April 1, traders on Monday demanded a roll back of the plan. They also approached New Delhi Lok Sabha member Meenakshi Lekhi, requesting a withdrawal of the restrictions.“The reintroduction of the pedestrianisation plan in the Karol Bagh market at this point of time is not a good idea as it is adversely impacting our business, which has gone down by over 50% in just a couple of days after the implementation. Seeing an uptick in Covid-19 cases, people don’t want to visit markets using public transport. They prefer private vehicles and now, as traffic is banned on the main market road, the number of shoppers has gone down,” Murli Mani, the president of Ajmal Khan Road Vyapar Mandal, said.However, officials said that there was no plan to withdraw the restrictions. “As of now, there is no plant to roll back the decision. But we are in touch with traders and assessing the situation. We will take necessary measures as and when required,” said Jai Prakash, mayor, North Delhi Municipal Corporation.Karol Bagh was the first shopping hub in Delhi to be pedestrianised, as part of which the main market road, Ajmal Khan Road, was restricted to vehicles in May last year.However, on demand from traders, a six-metre emergency lane on the road was opened to traffic in July. On April 1, the North Delhi Municipal Corporation reintroduced the restrictions.On Monday, the traders also protested in the market to oppose the move.Mani said that they wrote to area MP Lekhi demanding the withdrawal. “Our meeting with the Meenakshi Lekhi was scheduled for today (Monday), but she was not in town. We are planning to meet her tomorrow. We have submitted a letter of our demands,” Mani said.HT visited the market on Monday and found that traffic did not ply on the main Ajmal Khan Road although vehicles were parked outside a few shops. The main road was largely occupied by hawkers selling clothes, bags, shoes and utensils. Benches were stained with spit marks and dustbins were overflowing at a few locations. Although the traffic police and civil defence volunteers placed barricades, a few two-wheelers and e-rickshaws were seen navigating their way through the crowds on the stretch.“We are against the idea of pedestrianisation at a time when coronavirus cases are increasing. If this continues, then traders will literally be on the road as their business will be severely impacted. We have always supported the government and the civic body, but it’s their time to think about us and let vehicles ply so that the market remains alive,” said Ajay Bajaj, advisor, Karol Bagh Traders Federation.However, shoppers said they had a better experience when there were no vehicles. “When the market road is reserved for pedestrians, the shopping experience is pleasant as we can roam freely without the fear of being hit by a vehicle. When the stretch is pedestrianised, then everything looks in order,” Utkarsha Dixit, a shopper, said.Another shopper, Ashutosh Singh, said that most of the space that used to be covered by vehicles is clear now. “There is no clutter and no cacophony of vehicles in the market now,” Singh said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/karol-bagh-traders-oppose-pedestrianisation-move-101617647354939.html
06-04-2021||Delhi||Resident bodies help govt implement Covid measures as cases surge||As the Covid graph of the Capital continues its steep northward surge, the Delhi government has fallen back on the help of resident welfare associations (RWA) across the city to help it in implementing containment measures to check the virus spread, senior state officials said on Monday.Delhi on Monday witnessed 3,548 cases, at the back of 64,003 tests, at a positivity rate of 5.54%. Delhi’s positivity rate stayed below 5% for 124 days till it crossed that threshold on Monday.Officials said that RWAs across the city had started working in sync with various district administrations to help the government increase Covid vaccination coverage and ensuring delivery of essential goods at the doorsteps of patients in home isolation, the official added.“The government has held hundreds of meetings with resident welfare groups across the city since the beginning of the pandemic, seeking their cooperation in Covid-19 management. Such groups have been immensely helpful in the fight against the virus on a wide range of areas – increasing tests, making home isolation and containment possible, implementing Covid-19 regulations — especially after lockdown restrictions were relaxed — and now in the vaccination drive,” said Delhi revenue minister Kailash Gahlot on Monday.On April 1, when the vaccination drive opened for all individuals aged over 45 years, a few vaccine sites in north-east Delhi recorded unusually high turnouts.“We witnessed a lot of people arriving from specific localities in large groups. On the first day, we first saw a bus full of beneficiaries arrive at the vaccine site. Then electric rickshaws full of beneficiaries started making rounds. When this phenomenon into the second day, we realised that the mass arrival of beneficiaries was a result of an initiative by local resident welfare groups. It helped speed up the vaccination drive,” said a medical officer in-charge of a vaccine site in north-east Delhi, who did not wish to be identified.Since April 1, several vaccine sites across the city have witnessed a similar trend – large groups of people arriving to get their shots. Most of these beneficiaries often turn out to be neighbours from specific blocks and pockets of localities — like GTB Enclave, Keshavpuram, Model Town and Sarvapriya Vihar among others, said senior officials in the health and revenue departments of the government.Senior government officials said that hundreds of resident welfare associations across the city have also been helping the district administrations in scaling up tests and delivering essential goods to the residence of home isolated patients. As on Sunday, Delhi had 7,144 individuals in home isolation.“Delhi will not see a lockdown any time soon. So Covid-19 cases will fluctuate. This means that the government has to keep up its testing, tracing, isolation and vaccination efforts. And they cannot do it alone. Community involvement is vital. Our vaccination endorsement drives have so far been successful,” said BS Vohra, president of the East Delhi RWA front.Saurabh Gandhi, general secretary of United Residents of Delhi – another umbrella body of RWAs in the city – said: “Other than helping with vaccination registration, test camps and distribution of face masks, several RWAs are now also ensuring the supply of essentials both to the residence of home isolated patients and in containment zones in their neighbourhoods. It is a bit easy now, compared to the situation last year, because containment zones are much smaller. There are no barricades. One can easily drop items outside the door.”As on April 4, Delhi had nearly 3,000 micro-containment zones.“Now that the vaccine drive will be open for people aged over 45 years, we will intensify our campaign. We have already arranged cars, for elderly people who register themselves in advance in slots between 9am and noon. We can extend the timings in the coming days,” said Atul Kapoor, president of the south Delhi RWA Federation.Dr Jugal Kishore, head of community medicines department in Safdarjung Hospital, said: “Such community participation is extremely essential in the management of pandemics and disasters. It is good that a city like Delhi is witnessing more community participation at a time when cases are increasing again. The government should engage in more systematic ways to convert such community participation into an asset in the fight against Covid-19.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/resident-bodies-help-govt-implement-covid-measures-as-cases-surge-101617647294926.html

Altogether, 17 people have been arrested. We are conducting raids to identify and arrest the miscreants,” said superintendent of police Ashish Bharti.District magistrate Dharmendra Kumar and other senior officials also visited the scene with a large contingent of police. Reinforcements were called the situation is under control now, said Bharti.Agitating students blocked the old GT Road at Post Office Chowk, burnt tyres, and vandalised more than 15 vehicles, besides attacking the collectorate, SDM office and Nagar Parishad office.Town police station house officer Kamakhya Narayan Singh and three constables were injured before reinforcements arrived.The DM refuted reports that police opened fire. “In view of the raging pandemic, it had been decided to keep all educational institutions shut till at least April 11. But some coaching institute owners instigated students to indulge in lawlessness and many anti-social elements took advantage of the situation,” he said.“We are duty-bound to identify the culprits and take action. They may end up having adverse entry in their character certificates which could deprive them of many career opportunities,” he said.With inputs from agencies||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/4-cops-injured-in-sasaram-as-students-stir-turns-violent-101617640934696.html

Mastermind of U-type Maoist ambush in Chhattisgarh||38-year-old battle-hardened Maoist commander, Madvi Hidma, is the mastermind of Saturday’s gruesome ambush on security forces which killed at least 22 soldiers and injured several others at Bijapur-Sukma districts’ border in Chhattisgarh. He heads the first military battalion of the CPI (Maoist).As per the security officers aware of the developments, the possibility of Hidma laying a trap by providing false intelligence input to security forces about his presence in the jungles cannot be ruled out. “Hidma planned to lure security forces but for 15 days the security forces did not reach the area. He was getting desperate,” a police officer said, adding, “Hidma called over 300 armed cadres from different parts of Bastar who gathered close to the encounter spot”. The security forces personnel were trapped and ambushed around noon on Saturday. Considered one of the most dreaded Maoist leaders in Bastar, Hidma was born in Purvati village of south Sukma as is also known as Hidmalu and Santosh. He has a reputation as a ruthless rebel leader who runs a network of dedicated informers across the region. Hidma belongs to the Muriya tribal community of Bastar region. His village is still out of bounds for the police. Hidma reportedly received guerilla warfare training in the Philippines and is also believed to have carried out several attacks in the last decade. “Bastariya muriya tribals are aggressive and Hidma has already established himself as a master strategist and successful operational commander,” said a police officer. Also read: Govt will end Maoist menace, says Amit Shah on Chhattisgarh visitHidma is also known to be a shadowy figure who avoids media glare. A journalist who claimed to have met him several years ago said he came across someone who was determinedly reticent. His inner circle consists of heavily-armed youths, mostly his childhood friends.The brutal encounter carried out by Hidma, involving hundreds of Maoists, has led to security forces rethink their strategy. A senior Chhattisgarh police officer, who did not want to be named, said the encounter has prompted the security forces to have a strategy re-think as the forces cannot provide Maoists with any more strategic advantage in such encounters.Another police officer said the apparent reason for the Maoist attack could be the Chhattisgarh Police’s plan to open a security camp in Silger village just ahead of Terrem jungles. The region is considered a core area of Maoists. The camp would have cut a crucial Maoist corridor connecting Bijapur to Sukma and the rebels would have lost control over the region.The Maoists, who claim to be fighting for land rights of marginalised tribal communities, are active across 10 states and Chhattisgarh is seen as one of their last remaining strongholds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/who-is-madvi-hidma-mastermind-of-u-type-maoist-ambush-in-chhattisgarh-101617620716681.html
06-04-2021||Mumbai||Anil Deshmukh resigns as Maharashtra home minister after HC orders CBI probe||Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh resigned on Monday, hours after the Bombay high court ordered a federal probe into allegations of extortion against him, in what is the most high-profile casualty so far in the sensational Sachin Vaze-Antilia explosives case that has roiled Mumbai.Later the same evening, officials said the state government was considering challenging the HC order in the Supreme Court because Maharashtra had already ordered a judicial probe into the same allegations on March 30.The high court’s decision, allowing a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) inquiry into allegations against Deshmukh levelled by Param Bir Singh, the former commissioner of Mumbai Police, opens a new chapter in a 39-day long drama that has seen several twists and turns.It started with the discovery of an explosives-laden vehicle outside the residence of billionaire Mukesh Ambani, gathered momentum with the alleged murder of the man in possession of the car, and who had reported it stolen, Mansukh Hiran, and took a surprising turn with the arrest of a politically connected assistant inspector of police Sachin Vaze in the explosives case (he was subsequently named in the murder investigation too).Maharashtra’s Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government, in an attempt to manage the fallout, transferred Singh, with Deshmukh clearly articulating that the move was prompted by his mismanagement of the case. A miffed Singh wrote a letter to the chief minister, airing allegations that Deshmukh instructed Vaze to run an extortion racket and raise money ( ₹100 crore a month).Both Deshmukh and the MVA government sought to brazen it out initially even as Singh approached the Supreme Court seeking a CBI investigation. The apex court, after commenting on the timing of and motive behind Singh’s letter, refused to intervene and order a CBI probe, and said he could approach the high court.After Monday’s ruling, it became clear that Deshmukh could not continue in his role, and he resigned, citing “moral” grounds. “The high court asked the CBI to conduct a preliminary inquiry ...In the wake of the court’s decision I don’t feel morally right to continue on the position of the home minister. Hence, I have decided to step down from this position on my own,” read Deshmukh’s letter to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray.A CBI team from Delhi, comprising half a dozen officers, is expected to reach Mumbai on Tuesday to investigate the allegations of corruption against Deshmukh, said officials with knowledge of developments. The Delhi team will be assisted by Mumbai officers because the agency has only 15 days to complete the preliminary inquiry. The agency will record the statements of the petitioners, including Singh, said the officials cited above.Deshmukh is a senior member of the Nationalist Congress Party, which, along with the Shiv Sena and the Congress, makes up the MVA. He was replaced as home minister by Maharashtra labour and excise minister Dilip Walse Patil. The departments under Patil’s charge – labour and excise – will be handled by rural development minister Hasan Mushrif and deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, respectively, an announcement from the chief minister’s office said.The MVA government will respond after studying the judgement, Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut said. “No investigating agency is an incarnation of God. The issue is political, too. Our tradition is that we honour decisions of the judiciary.”The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) said the home minister was left with no option but to resign after the court’s ruling. “It was inevitable. The decision should have been taken long back...I am surprised to see the silence maintained by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on this entire episode,” said former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis.After resigning, Deshmukh took a flight to Delhi where he met Congress leader and prominent lawyer Abhishek Singhvi. A senior NCP functionary said he was also likely to meet Kapil Sibal, another top legal counsel, and discuss the merits of approaching the Supreme Court against the HC decision.On Monday, the Bombay high court directed CBI to complete a preliminary investigation into Singh’s allegations of an “extortion racket” in the next 15 days. The court left it to the discretion of the CBI director to decide the further course of action.Hearing a bunch of public interest litigations (PILs), including that filed by Singh, the HC observed that there couldn’t be an independent probe into the allegations if it was handed to Mumbai Police, which reports to the home department.A bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice GS Kulkarni said this was an “extraordinary” and “unprecedented” case that warranted an independent inquiry.“To instil public confidence and safeguard the fundamental rights of citizens, it is necessary that an inquiry and investigation is conducted by an independent agency and for such reasons, we consider it to be in the paramount public interest that an independent probe in the present circumstances would meet the ends of justice,” said the bench in its decision.Singh, who was removed as police commissioner on March 20, filed his plea four days later. He sought a CBI probe against Deshmukh who, he claimed, had asked police officers, including Vaze, to extort ₹100 crore from bars and restaurants. Deshmukh denied any wrongdoing.Soon after the court’s order, NCP chief Sharad Pawar and deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar met and decided it would be embarrassing for the NCP and the MVA government if the home minister was questioned by the CBI, said NCP leaders in the know.On February 25, an SUV was found abandoned outside Antilia, the residence of billionaire Ambani, with explosives, and a threat letter. It emerged that the car had been reported stolen on February by a car dealer from Thane, Hiran. Vaze was named in charge of the investigation — reports say he was the first officer on the spot — but transferred on March 12 after Fadnavis said he was connected with Hiran.On March 5, Hiran was found dead in mysterious circumstances. That case is being investigated by the National Investigation Agency, which is also probing the explosives case. NIA officials suggested Vaze may have orchestrated the whole thing to regain his stature in the force.Shortly after Deshmukh’s resignation, the BJP targeted Thackeray. “I find it interesting that Anil Deshmukh has taken moral responsibility. How about the responsibility of the CM...When will CM Uddhav Thackeray speak?” Union minister of law and justice Ravi Shankar Prasad said.The Maharashtra Congress general secretary and spokesperson Sachin Sawant said the verdict sets an unfortunate precedent. “The NCP or MVA has never denied any investigation into the allegations. In fact, the state government has already instituted an inquiry by a retired high court judge, which was upheld by the Bombay high court,” said NCP spokesperson Mahesh Tapase.The Shiv Sena said it believed in morality. “The Shiv Sena believes in ethical politics and hence we accepted the resignation of Deshmukh to facilitate the CBI probe,” said Sena legislator Manisha Kayande.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/anil-deshmukh-decides-to-step-down-as-maharashtra-home-minister-101617615855092.html
06-04-2021||Delhi||Delhi’s first Partition Museum likely to be ready by August this year||Letters, certificates, clothes, utensils, and photographs belonging to those who migrated to Delhi from across the border during the 1947 India-Pakistan partition will be on display at the Capital’s first Partition museum, which is likely to throw open its doors in August this year. The inauguration of the museum is set to coincide with the state government’s ongoing Freedom@75 celebrations — announced by the Delhi government in its annual budget last month to celebrate 75 years of Independence next year.The museum will be set up at the Dara Shikoh Library Building in Kashmere Gate and will be managed by The Arts and Cultural Heritage Trust (TACHT), which has the experience of having set up a similar museum in Amritsar. The trust adopted the heritage building inside Ambedkar University campus as a part of Central government’s Adopt a Heritage initiative on March 15 this year.Kishwar Desai, chair at TACHT, said that the project, tentatively named ‘Dastaan-e-Dilli’, will contain three museums related to the history of Delhi and the changes brought about by events and individuals. While the first one – on the partition – is expected to be ready in August, a second museum on Mughal prince Dara Shikoh, and a third on medieval and ancient antiquities from the Delhi state archaeology department will also come up later, Desai said.The trust, which calls the partition museum a “people’s museum”, said it had collected various artifacts, including the bare basics that people managed to bring with them — like clothes, utensils, letters, documents, photographs and certificates among others — while hurriedly trying to cross the border during the partition, which some estimates say left 2 million people dead and another 10 to 20 million displaced.For instance, a more than a century-old land deed — scripted in Urdu — giving details of the Late Lala Bishandas’ land in Jhang, Pakistan, will be on display at the museum. The family migrated to Delhi during the partition, like millions of others.A certificate of appreciation from Mahatma Gandhi awarded to a contractor Lala Beli Ram for planning Gandhi Square in Lahore, Scandal Point in Shimla, the Clock tower in Lyallpur (now known as Faisalabad in Pakistan), Gulab Devi Memorial hospital in Lahore, will also be included in the museum.“Within these artifacts are the stories of people who were forced to migrate overnight when the country was divided. It serves as a lesson that we should not divide and rule. The museum will also have inspirational stories of people who survived and those who helped them when they returned to this country after losing almost everything,” said Desai.The heritage site will also be developed as a cultural hub. “We plan to have cultural performances, a cafeteria, and several galleries. The plan is to have a large cultural hub at the heritage site with indoor and outdoor performance venues,” Desai said. “We would definitely welcome engagement from students of Ambedkar University, which is inside the campus and even those from Delhi University which is not very far.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhis-first-partition-museum-likely-to-be-ready-by-august-this-year-101617561731393.html
06-04-2021||World||France's Covid-19 hospitalisations at a near five-month high||France's hospital system is under heavy pressure from the pandemic, with the number of people treated in intensive care units for Covid-19 at the highest in almost a year, even though the country has just entered its third lockdown.The health ministry reported on Tuesday that the number of people in ICUs with Covid-19 had increased by 193 over 24 hours to 5,626, a peak since April 20 2020, when France was in its first March-May 2020 lockdown.And that figure is also rising further above the 4,919 high reached during country's second lockdown from Oct. 30 to Dec. 15.The total number of people hospitalised for the disease rose by 732 over 24 hours, the sharpest daily increase for more than four months, to 30,639, breaching the 30,000 limit for the first time since Nov. 24 and closing in on the Nov. 16 record of 33,497.France is hoping a ramp up of its vaccination campaign, combined with the one-month lockdown in place since last week-end, will help it regain control over the latest outbreak, fuelled by variants of the novel coronavirus.Earlier on Tuesday, the country started administering shots of the Covid-19 vaccine inside the Stade de France, the national stadium that once hosted soccer's World Cup final.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/frances-covid-19-hospitalisations-at-a-near-five-month-high-101617732190546.html
06-04-2021||World||Bangladesh records 7,213 new Covid-19 cases in highest single-day surge||Bangladesh registered the highest COVID-19 deaths and infections on Tuesday with 66 more people succumbing to coronavirus, taking the nation-wide tally to 6,51,652, according to the health authorities.Since March 8 last year, Bangladesh has recorded 9,384 COVID-19 deaths and 651,652 infection cases."The tally of infections has surged to 6,51,652 as 7,213 new cases were confirmed in the last 24 hours . . . 66 people died of COVID-19 during the period,” the Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS) said.The data showed 54 out of the 66 died in Dhaka division alone and 39 of them were men while 27 were women, it said.A total of 21.02 per cent of the 34,311 samples collected in the past one day were tested positive while the lowest infection rate was 2.30 per cent, recorded on February 8 this year, it added.A health ministry spokesman said the figures were highest in terms of both fatality and infection in a single day since the COVID-19 outbreak on March 8 last year, asserting the hospitals across the country have exhausted their capacity."We will not have any room in hospitals to set up an extra bed as we are adding overnight 1,200 extra beds to treat coronavirus patients," health minister Zahid Maleque said, asking people to stay indoors as much as possible.He said the government-run hospitals have 5,000 beds and the work was underway to set up another 1,200 beds, while the private facilities have 1,000 beds for the coronavirus patients.Maleque warned that the situation may go out of control soon, unless the existing lockdown was strictly enforced.Bangladesh had previously recorded the highest 64 deaths on June 30 last year.The health minister's comments came as the lockdown enforced two days ago appeared to have impacted little in restricting people while protests are underway to keep the open the shops, forcing police to use gunshots and resulting in death of one protester.Bangladesh enforced a seven-day nationwide lockdown on Monday when health officials recorded 58 coronavirus deaths and 5,683 fresh infection cases overnight, the third highest in terms of both fatality and infection since the outbreak of the pandemic.All domestic buses, ferries, trains and flights were suspended and shops and malls have been shut under the lockdown while the government earlier this week ordered the public and private offices to operate with 50 per cent workforce.However, the government on Tuesday decided to resume public transport services in major cities from Wednesday with road transport minister Obaidul Quader saying the restriction on transport movement was eased considering the people's "immense difficulties"."The public transport, however, will have to keep 50 per cent seats vacant," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bangladesh-records-7-213-new-covid-19-cases-in-highest-single-day-surge-101617731277866.html
06-04-2021||World||Expanded defence cooperation, free trade area figure in India, Russia talks||India and Russia on Tuesday discussed ways to deepen military and strategic cooperation, including manufacturing of Russian military hardware in the country, and begin talks on creating a free trade area between India and the Eurasian Economic Union. These matters figured in the meeting between external affairs minister S Jaishankar and his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov. “We talked about the longstanding partnership in nuclear, space and defence sectors... We spoke of connectivity, including the International North-South Transport Corridor and the Chennai-Vladivostok Eastern Maritime Corridor,” Jaishankar told a joint news conference after the talks.Lavrov, whose visit to New Delhi focussed on preparations for the annual India-Russia Summit to be held in the country later this year, said the two sides discussed military cooperation, including the expansion of the manufacturing of state-of-the-art Russian weapons in India under the “made in India” and Atmanirbhar Bharat initiatives.“In this strategically important area, Russia is a major foreign contractor for India. We are the only partner that indeed transfers to India cutting edge military technology,” he said.“Deepening of military cooperation serves national interests of both countries. At the same time, we respect the right of our Indian friends to diversify ties in this area,” he said.Jaishankar said India’s “defence sector requirements in the past year were expeditiously addressed” by Russia – an apparent reference to the country’s emergency military needs amid the border standoff with China in Ladakh sector.According to a recent estimate by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (Sipri), Russia was the most affected supplier as India’s arms imports fell 33% between 2011-15 and 2016-20. Though it continues to account for almost 60% of the hardware of the Indian military, Russia is also facing growing competition from the US and France.Responding to a question on reported US pressure on India to prevent military-technical cooperation with Russia, Lavrov said this was an issue for any country that wants to sign agreements with Russia for weapons systems. “We did not discuss these statements from the US, instead we confirmed that we are going to deepen our military cooperation... We also discussed the prospect of additional manufacturing of Russian military equipment in India within the concept of ‘Made in India’,” Lavrov said, adding that there were no “fluctuations or changes” on the part of India.The US has held out the possibility of slapping sanctions on India over the purchase of S-400 missile defence systems from Russia.Lavrov further said that working with India on trade and economic issues is one of the priorities of the Eurasian Economic Union, a bloc that includes Russia, Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan. “We hope to launch talks on a free trade area between India and the Eurasian Economic Union based on mutual benefit,” he said.The two sides also agreed on the need to “galvanise work on the renewed inter-governmental agreement on mutual security of investments” and on increasing the share of national currencies in trade, he said.Jaishankar also briefed Lavrov on new economic initiatives, such as Atmanirbhar Bharat and the production-linked incentives programmes, to expand manufacturing in 13 sectors which have opened up new opportunities for Russian businesses. Lavrov said the two sides also agreed on joint efforts to tackle a decline in mutual trade due to the Covid-19 pandemic. They also discussed cooperation in nuclear energy, space, including manned programmes, building rocket engines and satellite navigation, and transportation infrastructure projects in Russia’s the Far East and the Arctic, he said.Collaboration on Covid-19 vaccines figured in the talks, and Lavrov noted the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) has signed contracts with several Indian firms to manufacture about 750 million doses of the Sputnik V vaccine. He didn’t rule out further cooperation to cover manufacturing of Indian vaccines in Russia, while Jaishankar said a decision would be made by regulatory authorities of both sides. “For us, were those vaccines to be made in India, it would be one more affirmation of the importance of ‘Made in India’ and our own vaccine capacities,” Jaishankar said. The Russian minister also conveyed a message from President Vladimir Putin to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and invited Jaishankar to visit Russia. Former ambassador Vishnu Prakash said there are various difficulties associated with infrastructure development projects in Russia’s Far East and the proposed free trade area with the Eurasian Economic Union. “Besides India’s resource constraints, there’s also the influence of China. It won’t be easy for us to compete with China’s financial resources and economic muscle-flexing. Russia itself has been concerned about increasing Chinese influence in these areas,” he said. “The Russian military hardware is certainly something we should consider, but after the S-400 and the threat of sanctions under Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA), nothing is going to be smooth sailing. Being the devil’s advocate, I’m not dismissing this but it isn’t as straightforward as it would appear,” Prakash said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/expanded-defence-cooperation-free-trade-area-figure-in-india-russia-talks-101617730950617.html

06-04-2021||World||Norwegian emergency response team rescues Dutch cargo ship, prevents oil spill||Emergency response teams scrambled on Tuesday to prevent a Dutch cargo ship adrift in the North Sea from sinking and causing an oil spill off Norway's coast after the crew had to be evacuated in stormy weather.Footage released by the Norwegian Rescue Coordination Centre showed some of the 12 crew members jumping into the sea late on Monday from the badly listing Eemslift Hendrika before being rescued by helicopter. Others were hoisted directly from the deck.All were brought to safety, but the ship has continued to drift towards land. It is currently some 74 km (40 miles) off the Norwegian coast.The wind is expected to gradually shift the vessel to a course parallel to the shore, giving the salvage operation more time, Hans Petter Mortensholm of the Norwegian Coastal Administration told Reuters."Our calculations now indicate a window of opportunity to act, lasting until just after midday on Wednesday," he said. "The risk of pollution is our main concern."The Hendrika has around 350 tonnes of heavy oil and 50 tonnes of diesel in its tanks, the Coastal Administration said.Smit Salvage, a subsidiary of the Dutch marine services company Boskalis, told Reuters it had been contracted to try saving the ship and was mobilising a team to send to Norway later on Tuesday.Safety permitting, Smit would seek to get its own crew on board the Hendrika and link the vessel to a so-called anchor handling tug, a powerful ship built to move rigs for the oil industry."Getting her onto a tow line and to a calmer location, that is the goal," Smit Salvage spokesman Martijn Schuttevaer said.A Norwegian coastguard vessel is on standby in the area and could also be used for towing purposes, the Coastal Administration said.Built in 2015 and registered in the Netherlands, the 111.6 metre (366 feet) Eemslift Hendrika is a yacht transport vessel, carrying smaller boats on its deck, according to Monaco-based Starclass Yacht Transport, which markets the ship's services.One of the smaller vessels strapped to the deck fell off in the storm, the Coastal Administration said.

The panel report recommended criminal action against them.Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith, the head of the local Catholic church, has been demanding action against Sirisena.The Colombo Church has been holding a 'Black Sunday' congregation every week, demanding justice for the victims.Ranjith has vowed to take drastic action if the real culprits were not dealt with by the second anniversary of the attacks on April 21.The findings of the presidential panel which found Sirisena culpable has come under criticism by political parties claiming that the panel had not been able to identify the masterminds and those who provided funds to the bombers.The panel had recommended that findings against Sirisena and the then police top brass be referred to the Attorney General for necessary legal action.Sirisena has publicly denied receiving any prior information on the attacks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mastermind-of-easter-terror-attacks-identified-sri-lankan-minister-101617721929901.html

A 39-year-old woman was hospitalized in serious condition after she was shot in the arm and abdomen, police said.Five men were hospitalized in fair condition, while another person was in good condition after walking into a hospital in the Cook County suburb of Harvey with a gunshot wound to the leg, police said.No one was in custody Tuesday morning and detectives were investigating.The shooting comes amid recent violence in the city. The day before, on Easter Sunday, separate shootings across Chicago left seven people dead and at least 10 more with gunshot wounds.Last week, a 13-year-old boy, Adam Toledo, was fatally shot by a Chicago police officer after he ran from officers while carrying a handgun. He died at the scene March 29 and a gun was recovered. Mayor Lori Lightfoot said Monday that she had directed the Chicago Police Department to capture and bring to justice whoever gave the boy the handgun.Just last week, the department reported that by the end of March there were 131 homicides compared with 98 for the same period last year. And the number of shootings had already climbed past the 700 mark — more than 200 more than had been recorded during the first three months of last year.Those totals and the weekend slayings puts the city on a pace to eclipse the 769 homicides in 2020, which was the deadliest year in all but one year in the previous two decades.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/7-shot-and-wounded-as-gunfight-erupts-chicago-s-englewood-101617721154891.html
06-04-2021||World||‘Any solution in Afghanistan without Taliban runs risk of failure’: Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov||Any process to find a solution to the conflict in Afghanistan that excludes the Taliban runs the risk of failure, Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov said on Tuesday after talks with his Indian counterpart S Jaishankar.“The Taliban movement is part of Afghan society, and decisions on the settlement in Afghanistan should foresee the participation of all political, ethnic and religious groups of Afghanistan. Otherwise, it’s not going to be stable,” Lavrov told a joint press conference in response to a question on a possible power-sharing agreement with the Taliban.The latest developments in Afghanistan figured prominently in the meeting between the two ministers, who shared their assessments on the situation in the war-torn country. Lavrov’s delegation included Zamir Kabulov, the Russian presidential envoy to Afghanistan and a key player in Moscow’s reconciliation efforts.Lavrov said he and his Indian counterpart agreed the Russian and Indian representatives on Afghanistan will be in close contact regularly, while Jaishankar pointed out that “what happens in Afghanistan impacts [India’s] security directly”.“This decision has to be based on the balance of political and ethnic and religious interests... Any other way that foresees the exclusion of any group from this process will not lead to agreements that could be implementable and sustainable. All of this would be fraught with the risk of the resumption of the hostilities, which is not anybody’s desire,” he added.Jaishankar said India’s approach hinges on durable peace in Afghanistan, which would “require harmonising interests of all, both within and around that country”. He added, “The peace process must be based on foundational principles to which we all subscribe, and a political solution should mean an independent, sovereign, united and democratic Afghanistan.”Lavrov said he hoped the Biden administration would implement the agreement the Trump administration signed with the Taliban last year as it had “created a window of opportunity to reach an agreement between all the hostile parties”. Russia is ready to arrange further consultations under the “Moscow Format”, which includes India, China and Pakistan, to give impetus to the peace process, he said.People familiar with developments, said on condition of anonymity, that there was a frank exchange of assessments by both sides regarding the situation in Afghanistan, especially after the US administration’s fresh push for peace between the Afghan government and the Taliban. The Indian side highlighted its concerns about any hasty power-sharing agreement undoing the gains of the past two decades, the people said.India has been facing calls in recent years from leaders in the US, Russia and Iran to engage with the Taliban, though the government in New Delhi is yet to take a call on the issue. Questions were raised when Russia didn’t include India in a meeting of the “extended troika” in Moscow last month, especially after Pakistan was invited to the meet that included Taliban representatives. Lavrov headed to Pakistan from India, and his itinerary raised eyebrows in New Delhi as it is virtually unheard of for a Russian leader to travel to Islamabad from New Delhi.Lavrov also didn’t have an interaction with the Indian prime minister, usually a standard feature for a visit to New Delhi by a senior Russian leader. The people cited above sought to play down the matter, saying no such meeting was scheduled as the prime minister was away in West Bengal to address public meetings at Cooch Behar and Howrah as part of the BJP’s campaign for the state elections.There were no indications of differences at the joint press conference with both Lavrov and Jasishankar giving a positive readout on their discussions. While growing political and defence cooperation between Russia and China have sparked speculation about a potential military alliance between the two countries, Lavrov ruled out such a possibility.He said Russia-China summits had concluded that bilateral relations “are at the highest [point] in the history but these relations do not pursue a goal of establishing a military alliance”. Lavrov added, “By the way, we’ve heard speculations about pro-military alliances not only regarding Russia-China relations but also about such alliances allegedly being promoted such as ‘Middle East NATO’ and... ‘Asian NATO’. Today, we exchanged views on this and Indian friends have the same position as us. We believe that this is counter-productive and we are interested in inclusive cooperation that is for something, and not against somebody.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/any-solution-in-afghanistan-without-taliban-runs-risk-of-failure-russian-foreign-minister-sergey-lavrov-101617719480122.html

As per the same report, India will acquire herd immunity through vaccination in a little over three years.This comes amid the rising number of cases in Pakistan which has lead to increased restrictions, broader lockdowns and stronger standard operating procedures."Increased restrictions, broader lockdowns and stronger sops (Standard operating procedure) enforcement are starting to have effect. Initial signs of positivity slowing. However, due to momentum of last 2 weeks patients on critical care and mortality will stay at high levels for some time. Please follow sops and be safe," Asad Umar, chairman of the National Command and Operation Centre (NCOC) tweeted.The latest report also said that countries like Germany and France were likely to acquire herd immunity through vaccination in about a year.Taking Pakistan's current situation in account, the report also raised concern over the issue due to the "general indifference to medical problems once they stop bothering rich countries."As many as 3953 new cases were reported in the last 24 hours. The total number of COVID-19 cases in the country has reached 696,184.Amid the growing concerns over the spread of COVID-19 ahead of Ramadan, Pakistan last Sunday had reported 3,568 coronavirus patients, who are under critical care. This is the highest number ever since the pandemic started. (ANI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-will-take-a-decade-to-vaccinate-75-population-report-101617713049826.html

It was the island's worst rail accident in seven decades.The truck had slid down a sloping road from a building site onto the tracks just outside a tunnel. Officials suspect the truck's brakes were not properly applied and are investigating the manager of the site.Young Hong-tsu, chairman of Taiwan's Transportation Safety Board, said they had reconstructed how the truck had ended up on the rails, tracking its movements down the dirt road before it slipped off a bank and landed on the railway line, its front end facing the oncoming train.Young showed recovered footage taken from inside the driver's cabin as he desperately tried to slow down before hitting the truck at the entrance to the tunnel, causing the train to de-rail."How much time was there between this truck sliding onto the track and it hitting the Taroko express? Actually it was only a little bit more than one minute," he said, referring to the name of the train.Young said the driver had no time to properly slow the train and avoid the accident as he had only seconds to react, the truck being on a bend and not visible until it was too late.In a screenshot from the footage, the truck is clearly seen straddling the track, with leaves and branches sticking out of its front from when it slid down the wooded bank.The victims included two Americans and one French national.Young said Taiwanese authorities had been in touch with the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board and France's transport safety body to see if they were interested in helping with the investigation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/truck-landed-on-train-track-minute-before-deadly-taiwan-crash-101617714734458.html
06-04-2021||World||Bill Gates is reaching for the high-hanging fruit on climate||“Do the Hard Stuff Too” is Point #6 in Chapter 10 of Bill Gates’s new book, How to Avoid a Climate Disaster: The Solutions We Have and the Breakthroughs We Need. Gates elaborated on that point on April 1 in a video talk hosted by the Economic Club of New York. “To get to zero [emissions], you can’t leave the hard categories alone,” the co-founder of Microsoft Corp., now a full-time philanthropist, told the online audience. (He appeared with former Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson.) “We’ve put all the effort into the easy categories of cars and power generation,” Gates said. “In the hard categories, the work has barely, barely begun. You don’t get success unless you cover them all.”“All” is the key point. Businesspeople are accustomed to picking the low-hanging fruit first—knocking off the projects with the lowest costs and highest payoffs before tackling the harder stuff. But that won’t work for climate change, Gates says. To overwork the fruit metaphor, the climate can’t be saved unless all the fruit is picked, including the stuff on the very highest branches. And the effort has to start now.Example: There’s been a lot of progress on solar panels and wind turbines, which is great. Renewable energy has become what Gates calls an “easy” category. But they produce power intermittently, and there’s been far less progress on technologies for storing the energy they produce—not just for a few hours, but potentially for an entire season.The same goes for transportation. Batteries are wonderful for passenger vehicles, but there will never be battery-powered airliners because the batteries would weigh too much and take up too much room. So for the foreseeable future, the net-zero solution for airlines and some other forms of transportation will be alternative liquid fuels that are made from carbon that was already in the atmosphere. While those don’t add to carbon in the atmosphere they are prohibitively expensive and there hasn’t been enough research on bringing down their cost, Gates writes in How to Avoid a Climate Disaster.Other technologies that require research include zero-carbon steel and cement, meat and dairy made from plants or cells, capture of carbon from the air, safer nuclear power plants, nuclear fusion, and coolants that don’t contain fluorinated greenhouse gases, Gates writes.  It’s tempting to focus on ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. But “making reductions by 2030 the wrong way might actually prevent us from ever getting to zero,” Gates writes. An example of that would be replacing power plants that burn coal with power plants that burn natural gas, which is cleaner but still puts out greenhouse gases. A better strategy, Gates writes, is to focus investments on two priorities: installing as much zero-carbon generation as possible, and electrifying as many processes and products as possible in anticipation of the day when all electricity will be carbon-free.“If we think the only thing that matters is reducing emissions by 2030, then this approach would be a failure, since it might deliver only marginal reductions within a decade,” Gates writes. “But we’d be setting ourselves up for long-term success. With every breakthrough in generating, storing, and delivering clean electricity, we would march closer and closer to zero.”In short: Reach for the high-hanging fruit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bill-gates-is-reaching-for-the-high-hanging-fruit-on-climate-101617713376607.html

It took almost a week to dislodge it and get it under tow.That incident caused a hundreds-long traffic jam of ships. Tuesday’s disruption serves as a reminder that traffic through the waterway is vulnerable to things outside the control of the Egyptian authorities.About 12% of trade passes through the Suez Canal, a waterway shaving thousands of miles off voyages from Asia to Europe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/suez-canal-traffic-briefly-stopped-after-oil-tanker-loses-power-101617708667646.html

06-04-2021||World||US court moves extradition hearing of 26/11 accused Tahawwur Rana to June 24||A US court has postponed the in-person extradition hearing of Pakistani-origin Canadian businessman Tahawwur Rana, who is sought for his involvement in the 2008 Mumbai terror attack, from April 22 to June 24.US District Court Judge in Los Angeles Jacqueline Chooljian in her order on Monday moved the in-person extradition hearing of 59-year-old Rana to India to June 24.The court's order came after a conference between Rana's lawyers and those representing the US Government. During the conference, the two sides agreed to hold the in-person hearing of Rana on June 24 at 1.30 pm local Los Angeles time.Meanwhile, Rana’s attorneys in additional motion opposed his extradition to India.“The government has not identified a single case since the founding of this country in which a person acquitted by an American jury has been extradited to a foreign country for trial on charges resting on the same conduct,” it said in its 17-page new submission on Monday.The US Government has time till April 12 to submit its response, if any. The US Government so far has supported the extradition of Rana to India.Rana's attorney argued that the US government's position boils down to this: the term "offense" in the India-US Extradition Treaty means whatever the government needs it to mean.In Article 2, the dual criminality provision, where the government needs the term to have a broad meaning, it refers to underlying conduct. In Article 6, it means "conduct" when needed to achieve a plea deal with Headley, and it means "elements" when needed to extradite Rana.“The Court should reject this "heads the government wins, tails Rana loses" approach. Applying ordinary tools of interpretation, it should hold that the term "offense" in Article 6 refers to the underlying conduct, and it should deny extradition,” it argued.Rana, a childhood friend of David Coleman Headley, was re-arrested on June 10 in Los Angeles on an extradition request by India for his involvement in the Mumbai terror attack in which 166 people, including six Americans, were killed. He has been declared a fugitive by India.Pakistani-American Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) terrorist Headley was involved in plotting the 2008 Mumbai terror attack. He was made an approver in the case, and is currently serving a 35-year prison term in the US for his role in the attack.As per the India-US Extradition Treaty, the Indian government has requested the formal extradition of Rana, and the United States has initiated this extradition proceeding. The US Government has argued that Rana meets all the criteria warranting certification of his extradition to India.These are: the court has both personal and subject matter jurisdiction, there is an extradition treaty between the United States and India that is in full force and effect, and the crimes for which Rana's extradition is sought are covered by the terms of the treaty.In his previous court submission on February 4, Rana's attorney had argued that Rana's extradition is barred under Article 6 of the United States-India extradition treaty because he had previously been acquitted of the offences for which his extradition is sought, and under Article 9 of the treaty because the government has not established probable cause to believe that Rana committed the alleged offences.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-court-moves-extradition-hearing-of-26-11-accused-tahawwur-rana-to-june-24-101617704771978.html

Korea to not attend Tokyo Olympics, dashes Seoul's hopes of restarting talks||North Korea will not attend this year's Tokyo Olympics because of the coronavirus pandemic, Pyongyang's sports ministry said, dashing Seoul's hopes of using the Games to restart talks with its nuclear-armed neighbour.The isolated North's participation in the last Winter Games, hosted by the South in Pyeongchang, was a catalyst in the diplomatic rapprochement of 2018.Leader Kim Jong Un's sister Kim Yo Jong attended as his envoy in a blaze of publicity, and the South's President Moon Jae-in seized the opportunity to broker talks between Pyongyang and Washington that led to a series of high-profile meetings between Kim and then US president Donald Trump.But Pyongyang's announcement extinguishes the possibility that the postponed Tokyo Games, due to begin in July, could kick off a reset in the now deadlocked talks process.North Korea's Olympic Committee "decided not to participate in the 32nd Olympic Games in order to protect players from the world public health crisis caused by Covid-19", said the Sports in the DPR Korea website, run by the sports ministry in Pyongyang.But analysts said other factors may have been at play.The announcement -- dated Monday -- reported a meeting of the national Olympic committee on March 25.The North's official KCNA news agency had previously carried a dispatch on the committee meeting, without mentioning the Olympic decision.All International Olympic Committee member countries are required to take part in each Games under the Olympic charter.An IOC spokesperson told AFP that it had "not received any official application from the NOC of DPRK to be released from their obligation".The spokesperson added that "despite several requests" the North's Olympic Committee had been unable to hold a conference call to discuss the coronavirus situation.Border lockdownPyongyang is more isolated than ever after imposing a strict border closure more than a year ago to protect itself from the virus that first emerged in neighbouring China.While the North insists it has had no coronavirus cases -- although experts doubt the assertion -- the lockdown has exacerbated the economic pain from multiple international sanctions over its banned weapons programmes.The new US administration of Joe Biden is in the final stages of a review of North Korea policy, with officials widely expected to support a resumption of lower-level talks rather than high-stakes, high-drama summits.On the campaign trail, Biden characterised Kim as a "thug" and has sharply criticised Trump's meetings, saying he legitimised one of the world's most ruthless leaders, but has also said he is open to diplomacy.Biden recently warned North Korea of consequences for violations of UN Security Council resolutions after Pyongyang tested what US officials judged to 'Shameless distortion'Inter-Korean relations are also at a standstill, with the North repeatedly saying it has no interest in talking to Seoul, and last year blowing up a liaison office on its side of the border.Even so, Moon in his Independence Day speech on March 1 said: "This year's Tokyo Olympics could be an opportunity for dialogues between South Korea and Japan, the North and the South, North Korea and Japan, and North Korea and the US."The day commemorates mass protests that took place in 1919 across the Korean peninsula against Tokyo's colonial rule.Seoul's unification ministry said it was "sorry that the Covid situation" had prevented the Games from serving as "an opportunity to advance peace on the Korean peninsula".Japan's chief government spokesman Katsunobu Kato said it was monitoring the reports and authorities were seeking to improve the environment, "including infection countermeasures, so that many countries and regions can participate in the Tokyo Games".Analysts said the virus may not be the only reason behind Pyongyang's decision."Pyongyang seems to be protesting against Japan's policies on North Korea, as sensitive issues such as human rights and sanctions have been raised by Tokyo, along with the US," Yang Moo-jin, a professor at the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul, told AFP.The North regularly excoriates Olympic host nation Japan over its brutal 20th-century annexation, with KCNA carrying a report Sunday condemning new Japanese history textbooks as "persistent and shameless distortion of history".Tokyo regularly demands resolution of the issue of Japanese citizens kidnapped by the North, although Pyongyang insists it has returned all those it seized who are still alive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/n-korea-to-not-attend-tokyo-olympics-dashes-seoul-s-hopes-of-restarting-talks-101617702886016.html

Export restrictions by India left the vaccine-sharing programme short of supplies of AstraZeneca's vaccine made by the Serum Institute of India.Harris said she had no update on any countries stepping forward, adding: "We are very much looking for more vaccine".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-does-not-back-vaccination-passports-for-now-spokeswoman-101617703830047.html

This will ensure that those who received placebo doses initially receive the actual vaccine now, and vice-versa. All the participants, however, will continue to be "blinded" so they do not know if they received the experimental vaccine or the placebo, the news agency added.A 'placebo' vaccine has no therapeutic value, but can function as a control for vaccine testing, where researchers gauge the efficacy of the actual vaccine dose by observing the "expected" physiological response in patients, who have no idea if they treatment they just received was active or inactive. Placebo-controlled studies are thus most commonly used in "blinded" clinical trials, where such information about vaccine efficacy is consensually withheld from the participants to illicit an expected response.Even when other authorised vaccines are made available, allowing volunteers on placebo to cross over to the active vaccine offers them an incentive to continue with the trials. Novovax plans to put this incentive to good use, planning to cross over participants in its ongoing large, late-stage study in the United States and Mexico, Reuters reported, adding that Novovax will read out initial clinical data during the second quarter."The crossover arms ensure that all participants have access to an active vaccine candidate while allowing Novavax to continue to monitor the safety and efficacy of our vaccine over the long term," Reuters quoted Filip Dubovsky, M.D., Chief Medical Officer at Novavax, as saying. "We are grateful to the volunteers who stepped forward to take part in our clinical trials, without whom we would be unable to develop, study and ultimately deliver what we hope will be a significant tool in the fight against Covid-19," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/novovax-allows-volunteers-on-placebo-to-get-covid-19-vaccine-in-trials-101617691075201.html
06-04-2021||World||China cautions Japan ahead of Biden-Suga meet, asks to be 'objective, rational'||China’s foreign minister cautioned Japan against teaming up with the US to counter Beijing, as Japan speaks up more on human rights in China's Xinjiang region ahead of a US-Japan summit next week.Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi told his Japanese counterpart in a phone call Monday evening that their two countries should ensure that their relations “do not get involved in the so-called confrontation between major countries,” a Chinese Foreign Ministry statement said.It quoted Wang as saying that “China hopes that Japan, as an independent country, will look at China’s development in an objective and rational way, instead of being misled by some countries holding biased view against China.”Japan, a close US ally that hosts major American naval and air force bases, shares US concerns about China's military buildup and claims to territory in the South and East China Seas. However, its major trade and investment interests in China have at times reined in its criticism of its larger neighbor.Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga is to travel to Washington to meet President Joe Biden on April 16 in what will be the US leader’s first in-person summit since taking office in January.Biden, in contrast to his predecessor Donald Trump, has stressed rebuilding ties with European and Asian allies as the US prepares for competition with a rising China.Japanese Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi raised human rights in China's Xinjiang region and Hong Kong, both important issues for Biden. He also reiterated Japan's protest against China's presence in waters around a group of uninhabited, Japan-controlled islands that China claims in the East China Sea.Motegi told reporters Tuesday that he expressed “grave concern and strongly requested China to take concrete actions" for improvement on those issues, including the human rights situation in the Xinjiang region.Some members of a foreign policy team within Suga's conservative ruling party have called for his government to take a tougher stance against China over the Xinjiang situation. They say Japan should adopt a law to impose sanctions against a foreign country over human rights violations.The United States, Canada, Britain and the European Union have adopted such a law, and they say Japan is the only Group of Seven country without it.Japan has taken a softer approach by maintaining dialogue rather than imposing unilateral sanctions. But Chief Cabinet Secretary Katsunobu Kato on Tuesday said Japan is open to the possibility of having such a law."It is necessary to analyze and consider whether Japan should adopt a system that would unilaterally determine human rights violations and impose sanctions, taking into consideration various views including our ongoing human rights and foreign policies and trends in the international community,(asterisk) he said.Kato said it is important for each country to do what it can to improve human rights conditions. “Japan will continue to cooperate with the United States and other related countries,” he said.Wang opposed Japanese interference in China’s internal affairs in Xinjiang and Hong Kong, the Chinese statement said.Taiwan is another potential flashpoint, with Suga saying earlier this week that Japan would cooperate with the US on the issue. China regards the self-governing island as a renegade province that should be under Chinese rule.China, in a signal to the US and its allies, recently sent an aircraft carrier group to waters near Taiwan for training exercises.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-cautions-japan-ahead-of-biden-suga-meet-asks-to-be-objective-rational-101617701678016.html
06-04-2021||World||US, Iran begin indirect talks in Vienna to revive 2015 nuclear deal||Iran and the United States will begin indirect talks in Vienna on Tuesday aimed at bringing both countries back into full compliance with the 2015 nuclear deal that Washington abandoned three years ago.Iran has steadily overstepped the accord's limits on its nuclear programme in response to Washington's withdrawal from the accord in 2018 and its reimposition of sanctions that have crippled the Islamic Republic's economy.While Tehran has repeatedly rebuffed "direct and indirect negotiations" with its old foe, Washington said on Monday it expected the talks to be difficult. Both Tehran and Washington did not foresee any early breakthrough."We are not optimistic nor pessimistic about the outcome of this meeting now, but we are confident that we are on the right track, and if America's will, seriousness and honesty is proven, it could be a good sign for a better future for this agreement and ultimately its full implementation," Iranian government spokesman Ali Rabiei told reporters.US and Iranian officials will begin indirect talks in the Austrian capital, where the pact was originally reached in 2015, later on Tuesday. Officials from Britain, France and Germany, are expected to act as intermediaries. Russia and China, the other parties to the 2015 pact, will also attend.A Western diplomat told Reuters on Friday that a shuttle-diplomacy approach would be adopted. The diplomat said France would be the main interlocutor for both sides.According to diplomats, the remaining parties to the deal will first meet at a Viennese hotel for preparatory talks. The US delegation, headed by special envoy Rob Malley, will be based in a nearby hotel.Adding fresh doubt to chances of a breakthrough, an Iranian official told Reuters: "Our agenda during the meeting will be removal of all U.S. sanctions against Iran ... as our supreme leader has said repeatedly, anything less than that will not be accepted by Tehran."Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has the final say on all state matters, has opposed any gradual easing of sanctions.An EU official said working groups would be created with the aim of marrying lists of sanctions that the United States could lift and nuclear obligations that Iran should meet.Diplomats said Tuesday's talks could continue for several days to resolve some of the easier issues before resuming next week. The aim is some form of a deal ahead of June's Iranian presidential election, the official said, although Iranian and US officials have said there is no rush.President Joe Biden's administration wants to revive the accord but has said that this requires negotiations. Tehran has dismissed any engagement in talks with Washington about both sides resuming compliance with the deal.Under the 2015 accord, US and other economic sanctions on Tehran were removed in return for curbs on Iran’s nuclear programme to make it harder to develop a nuclear weapon - an ambition Tehran denies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-iran-begin-indirect-talks-in-vienna-to-revive-2015-nuclear-deal-101617701012344.html
06-04-2021||World||Financial regulator asks G20 countries to prepare Covid-19 relief exit plan||While ending Covid-19 economic relief measures too soon would present more of a threat to financial stability than leaving them in place too long, it was time for G20 countries to decide how it should be done, the Financial Stability Board said on Tuesday.The FSB, which coordinates financial rules for the G20 group of rich nations, said the speedy, sizeable and sweeping measures introduced by governments in the past year have limited economic fallout from the Covid-19 shock, but phasing them out will also present risks given continued uncertainties.Despite the arrival of vaccines, the withdrawal of relief measures is not imminent given the pandemic is worse in some countries than had been anticipated a few months ago, the FSB said.In a report to help G20 countries exit the measures, the FSB recommended a flexible approach that withdraws relief gradually in a sequenced way to avoid a "cliff edge" effect from simultaneous expiries.Withdrawals could be based on narrowing the scope of relief measures, requiring beneficiaries to opt in, making the support progressively less generous, and sequencing the expiry of different relief.A "state-contingent" approach rather than a pre-announced timetable for withdrawal could help to minimize long-term financial stability risks, the FSB said."For many support measures, authorities need to take a decision on whether to extend, amend or unwind them," the FSB said in its report for G20 finance ministers meeting virtually this week."Prematurely withdrawing temporary measures designed to support bank lending could lead to an unintended tightening of bank lending."FSB Chair Randal Quarles, said in a letter to G20 members there were signs of an emerging "inflection point" as vaccines are rolled out, albeit at different paces."While it is sensible to keep measures that support financial system stability and financing of the real economy in place as long as needed, the factors to be considered in deciding whether to extend, amend and, eventually, end support measures are taking shape," said Quarles, who is also vice chair for supervision at the US Federal Reserve.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/financial-regulator-asks-g20-countries-to-prepare-covid-19-relief-exit-plan-101617699049918.html

Most in the queue were young Pakistanis still not eligible for the government's free vaccination, reported TRTWorld.While the private sale of vaccines has begun, the government and importers are still locked in a pricing dispute.Pakistan initially agreed to exempt imported vaccines from price caps, but later rescinded the exemption and said it would set maximum prices.One pharmaceutical company, which had already imported 50,000 doses of Sputnik V, took the government to court, where it won an interim order allowing it to sell it until pricing is decided, reported TRTWorld.The number of patients now in critical care has reached 3,568, the highest since the pandemic started, a cabinet minister, Asad Umar, said on Twitter.Pakistan has thus far reported 687,908 infections and 14,778 deaths, reported TRTWorld.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistanis-rush-to-buy-sputnik-v-covid-19-vaccine-as-commercial-sales-begin-101617699488746.html
06-04-2021||World||Myanmar protesters paint Yangon red, defying bloody army crackdown||Opponents of Myanmar's military junta sprayed red paint on roads in the country's biggest city on Tuesday to mark the deaths of hundreds of "martyrs" killed by troops, as the crisis dragged on with no clear diplomatic solution in sight.Some 570 people have been killed during nearly two months of unrest since the military coup on Feb. 1, and security forces have arrested close to 3,500 people, with about four-fifths of them still in detention, advocacy group the Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP) said on Tuesday.Demonstrators woke early in Yangon to spray and splash pavements, roads and bus shelters with red paint in protest at a sweeping crackdown by security forces that has caused weeks of international outrage."The blood has not dried," said one message in red.Another daubed across a bus shelter took aim at rank-and-file soldiers who it said were being exploited by kleptocratic generals."Don't kill people just for a small salary as low as the cost of dog food," it said.Anger has swept Myanmar in the past two months over the return of a military government and an abrupt end to a brief era of democratic and economic reform and international integration that was absent under the military's oppressive 1962-2011 rule.Some protesters have called their movement a "spring revolution", characterised by street marches, quirky acts of non-violent rebellion and civil disobedience campaigns aimed at crippling the government apparatus.Internet blackoutsTheir ability to organise may have been hampered in recent days by the military's halt of broadband wireless internet, adding to a weeks-long block of mobile data services which had been the main channel for spreading word of what was happening in the country during the crackdown.Those able to access social media, including some journalists, on Tuesday shared pictures of striking workers marching for a second day in the city of Mandalay, some wearing gas masks and giving the three-finger salute that has become a symbol of resistance to army rule.A day earlier, demonstrators held placards of detained leader Aung San Suu Kyi and signs calling for international intervention.Authorities have issued arrest warrants for dozens of celebrities, models and influencers, and on Tuesday a popular comedian was arrested in Yangon, the Mizzima news site reported.Sithu Aung Myint, a prominent journalist, was on the wanted list. Writing on Facebook, he said he was proud to be considered a threat."When the coup council who have been committing crimes announces you as a lawbreaker together with the whole country, you will be more than happy because you are recognised as a hero in this revolution," he wrote."Your next generation will be proud of you."Protesters and workers have come out daily against the military takeover, which followed several years of awkward power-sharing between generals and Suu Kyi's civilian government under a democratic system created by the army.Suu Kyi's party won an election by landslide in November, and had pledged to change the constitution to reduce the military's political clout.Despite the election commission saying the vote was fair, the military justified its coup by alleging that the ballot was fraudulent, and has promised to hold a new election at an unspecified time.Diplomatic EffortOn Monday, the military's mouthpiece newspaper, the Global New Light of Myanmar, carried a banner quoting the junta's leader, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing."Democracy is based on the wish of the majority, but such a wish must be authentic with honest politics," it said.Min Aung Hlaing has sought to play down the unrest and dismissed international concern as misplaced, calling it an internal issue that the military was handling with "utmost restraint".Western countries have called for a restoration of Suu Kyi's government, a position echoed by only a handful of Myanmar's regional neighbours.Brunei, the chair of the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) on Monday agreed to a meeting of its leaders over the crisis in Myanmar, though no date was set,ASEAN operates by consensus but the divergent views of its 10 members on how to respond to the army's use of lethal force against civilians and the group's policy of non-interference has limited its ability to act.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-protesters-paint-yangon-red-defying-bloody-army-crackdown-101617698885948.html
06-04-2021||World||NASA's Ingenuity helicopter survives first night alone on Mars||NASA's Ingenuity mini-helicopter has survived its first night alone on the frigid surface of Mars, the US space agency said, hailing it as "a major milestone" for the tiny craft as it prepares for its first flight.The ultra-light aircraft was dropped on the surface on Saturday after detaching from the belly of the Perseverance rover, which touched down on the Red Planet on February 18.Detached from the Perseverance, Ingenuity had to rely on its own solar-powered battery to run a vital heater to protect its unshielded electrical components from freezing and cracking during the bitter Martian night, where temperatures can plunge as low as minus 130 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 90 degrees Celsius).Also Read | ‘Touchdown confirmed!’: Nasa’s Mars Ingenuity drops from Perseverance belly. List of milestonesMaking it through the frigid Martian night was "a major milestone for the small rotorcraft," NASA said in a statement Monday."This is the first time that Ingenuity has been on its own on the surface of Mars," said MiMi Aung, Ingenuity project manager at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory."But we now have confirmation that we have the right insulation, the right heaters, and enough energy in its battery to survive the cold night, which is a big win for the team. We're excited to continue to prepare Ingenuity for its first flight test."Over the coming days, Ingenuity will undergo tests of its rotor blades and motors.If all goes well, Ingenuity is expected to make its first flight attempt no earlier than the evening of April 11, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory said.It will be the first aircraft to attempt powered, controlled flight on another planet.Tribute to Wright brothersIngenuity is carrying a small piece of cloth that covered one of the wings of the Wright brothers' first aircraft which achieved the first powered flight on Earth at Kitty Hawk in 1903, to pay tribute to the milestone.Its attempt will also coincide with the 60th anniversary of the first human space flight, by Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin on April 12, 1961, and 40th anniversary of the April 12, 1981 launch of the first space shuttle, Columbia.Ingenuity will be attempting to fly in an atmosphere that is one percent the density of Earth's, which makes achieving lift harder -- but will be assisted by gravity that is one-third of our planet's.The first flight will involve climbing at a rate of about three feet (one meter) per second to a height of 10 feet (three meters), hovering there for 30 seconds, then descending back to the surface.Ingenuity will be taking high-resolution photography as it flies from its "airfield" in the Jezero Crater.A series of flights are planned over its mission lasting 30 Martian sols (31 Earth days)."Our 30-sol test schedule is frontloaded with exciting milestones," said Teddy Tzanetos, Ingenuity deputy operations lead."Whatever the future holds, we will acquire all the flight data we can within that timeframe."The four-pound (1.8-kilogram) rotorcraft cost NASA around $85 million to develop and is considered a proof of concept that could revolutionize space exploration.Future aircraft could cover ground much quicker than rovers, and explore more rugged terrain.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nasas-ingenuity-helicopter-survives-first-night-alone-on-mars-101617699004119.html

I know family, friends and significant parts of our economy will welcome it, as I know I certainly do."Some other neighbouring countries have outlined plans for special travel zones, but the New Zealand-Australia arrangement is among the first that does not involve COVID-19 testing.About 568,000 New Zealand-born people live in Australia, according to 2018 figures, equivalent to 2.3 per cent of the Australian population and Australia's fourth-largest migrant community.Trade between the two countries is worth NZ$25.6 billion, according to New Zealand data, making Australia New Zealand's biggest trading partner.Flights to and from some Australian states could still be suspended if there were local outbreaks, Ardern warned.Australia has recorded about 29,400 COVID-19 cases and 909 deaths since the pandemic began, while New Zealand has had just over 2,100 confirmed cases and 26 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pm-ardern-sets-april-19-for-start-of-australia-new-zealand-travel-bubble-101617686415330.html

06-04-2021||World||US consumer watchdog eyes rules to prevent foreclosures||The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau said Monday it is considering new rules aimed at averting a wave of foreclosures later this year when millions of homeowners are no longer allowed to put off making their mortgage payments.Last year, the federal government suspended foreclosures and evictions for mortgages insured by the Federal Housing Administration as the coronavirus pandemic left millions of people unemployed. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac did the same for borrowers in single-family homes with loans backed by the two mortgage buyers. The initiatives offered borrowers relief for up to one year and suspended late charges and penalties.As of February, nearly 3 million U.S. homeowners were behind on their home loans, with about 2.1 million mortgages in forbearance and at least 90 days late, according to the CFPB. If current trends continue, there still may be 1.7 million such loans by September, the CFPB said.One rule proposed by the agency would prohibit mortgage servicers from starting the foreclosure process before Dec. 31. The CFPB is also considering whether to permit servicers to initiate foreclosures before the end of this year, in certain cases, such as if they've made efforts to contact an unresponsive borrower.The CFPB is also weighing a rule that would allow servicers to offer “certain streamlined loan modification options” to borrowers with hardships caused by the pandemic, and changes to ensure servicers are notifying borrowers of their options in a timely basis. The agency is seeking public input on its proposed rule changes through May 11.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-consumer-watchdog-eyes-rules-to-prevent-foreclosures-101617668823688.html

But the AstraZeneca dose delay leaves it struggling to step up the pace of its vaccination drive.The majority of Australia's near 26 million population will be administered the AstraZeneca vaccine, with 50 million doses set to be produced locally from the end of March. About 2.5 million doses have been locally produced so far with thousands of doses already cleared testing and distributed to the vaccination sites.The Pharmacy Guild of Australia, tasked to help with the rollout of the nationwide inoculation programme from May, said on Tuesday that slow domestic vaccine approvals and logistics issues will now push deliveries to June."We have been told that the delay is linked to supply chain delays rather than the ability of the pharmacy network to participate," Pharmacy Guild President Trent Twomey told Reuters.Twomey also blamed the slow rollout on a lack of co-ordination between the Australian national government and states, with the latter complaining about slower-than-expected distribution and a lack of certainty on vaccine supplies.National authorities, however, said vaccination centres would be doubled by the end of the week, as they look to ramp up the vaccination programme that aims to provide at least one dose to every person by the end of October.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australia-short-of-3-million-astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine-doses-in-blow-to-vaccination-drive-101617683660506.html

06-04-2021||World||India’s ‘double mutant’ Covid-19 variant detected in US||The “double mutant” variant of the coronavirus behind the ongoing surge in Covid-19 cases in India has now been detected in the US. The first confirmed infection was reported on Monday.It was found in a patient tested by Stanford Health Care Clinical Virology Laboratory in California, according to news reports that cited the organisation’s mediaperson. The case was detected in the San Francisco Bay Area, as reported by The Hill.The new variant of the coronavirus is called “double mutant” because it carries two mutations of the pathogen that triggered the pandemic.It has hit the US amid growing concerns about an impending surge fuelled by new and emerging variations and complacency engendered by high rates of vaccination - more than 3 million a day recently, with a record of 4 million last Saturday - being reported from around the country.“This Indian variant contains two mutations in the same virus for the first time, previously seen on separate variants,” Peter Chin-Hong, an infectious diseases expert at University of California San Francisco, told San Francisco Chronicle.The new variant is said to be responsible for the surge in new daily cases seen since over the past few weeks. From around 9,100 on February 15, the number of new infections shot up in a matters of weeks to103,000 on April 4, according to the US-based Johns Hopkins University’s Covid-19 tracker.A response was awaited from the Center of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to a request for confirmation of reports about the new variant from India and for details about the nature of the threat posed by it, and whether it was resistant to the three vaccines being administered in the US now - Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson.The CDC has been tracking new and emerging mutations of the coronavirus and it currently has five of them on its radar, according to an April 2 post on its website.Since December 2020, it has been monitoring B.1.1.7, a Covid-19 variant first detected in the UK. In January, it added B.1.351 to the list, a variant first detected in South Africa. Later that month, the CDC added P.1 to the list, a Brazilian variant first detected in Japan. In March, two more variants were added to the list, namely B.1.427 and B.1.429.The CDC, the key US federal agency that deals with health crises, says the above variants generally seem to “spread more easily and quickly than other variants” and could cause increased cases. That, in turn, could lead to more hospitalisations and deaths from Covid-19 by straining available resources.The vaccines currently in use in the US are known to be effective against these variants. “So far, studies suggest that antibodies generated through vaccination with currently authorised vaccines recognise these variants,” the CDC said. “This is being closely investigated and more studies are underway”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indias-double-mutant-covid-19-strain-detected-in-us-101617681677609.html
06-04-2021||World||Explained: Minneapolis chief seeks to reform police department||Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo was a star witness for the prosecution Monday at the trial of a former officer charged with killing George Floyd, repeating the criticism he levied after Floyd's death.Arradondo, the city’s first Black chief, fired Derek Chauvin and three other officers the day after Floyd died, and soon afterward labelled it “murder.” He testified Monday that Chauvin's actions were counter to his training and to department values.It's a familiar message. Arradondo has spent the months since Floyd's death trying to transform a police department derided by critics as brutal and resistant to change, while fighting to preserve it from a liberal City Council that wants to replace it with a public safety unit or cut the number of officers.FROM PATROL OFFICER TO POLICE CHIEFArradondo, a fifth-generation Minnesotan, joined the Minneapolis Police Department as a patrol officer, eventually working his way up to precinct inspector and head of the Internal Affairs Unit, which investigates officer misconduct allegations. Along the way, he and four other Black officers successfully sued the department for discrimination in promotions, pay and discipline. His predecessor, Janee Harteau, promoted him to assistant chief in early 2017.He took over months later, after Harteau was forced out over the fatal shooting of Australia native Justine Ruszczyk Damond, who had called 911 to report a possible sexual assault behind her house. The Black officer in that case was convicted of third-degree murder and is serving a 12 1/2-year term. Damond’s death came two years after 24-year-old Jamar Clark, who was Black, was killed in a scuffle with two white police officers, setting off weeks of protests; neither officer was charged.BECOMING POLICE CHIEFWhen Arradondo was tapped to lead the Minneapolis Police Department in 2017, he faced a public newly outraged by Damond's death and still carrying deep mistrust over the killing of Clark.Civil rights advocates say Arradondo inherited a department with a history of misconduct spanning decades.Many hoped he could change the culture of a department that critics said too frequently used excessive force and discriminated against people of color. He spoke of restoring trust during a swearing-in ceremony that became a community celebration featuring song, dance and prayer.Arradondo made some quick changes, including toughening department policy on use of body cameras and requiring all officers to go through training that stresses respectful interaction with the public. But he was criticized following Floyd's death. Council member Steve Fletcher said Arradondo was lenient in his first year as chief as he worked to build department morale, which made it more difficult to get rid of problem officers later.AFTER FLOYD'S DEATHArradondo quickly fired the four officers at the scene of Floyd’s death.Derek Chauvin, the white officer seen on video pressing his knee into Floyd’s neck for 9 minutes, 29 seconds, was charged with second-degree murder and other counts. City records show he had 17 complaints against him, only one of which resulted in discipline. He also shot two people during his 19-year career and was never charged.The other three officers face charges of aiding and abetting second-degree murder.Arradondo and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey pushed for sweeping policy changes: Banning police chokeholds and neck restraints; requiring officers to try to stop any other officers they see using improper force; and preventing officers involved in using deadly force from reviewing body camera footage before completing an initial police report.But they also faced efforts from the City Council to disband the police department altogether — a move that was eventually blocked from appearing on November ballots.Minneapolis agreed to pay $27 million to Floyd's family to settle a federal civil rights lawsuit alleging the city allowed a culture of excessive force, racism and impunity to flourish in its police force.___Webber reported from Fenton, Michigan.

06-04-2021||World||New lava stream flows from Iceland volcano||Iceland's spectacular, two-week old volcanic eruption entered a new phase Monday as television pictures showed a fresh fissure had opened up and begun spitting out lava.The 200-metre (yards) long fissure is a kilometre from the first eruption, which sits in the Geldingadalur valley, said an Icelandic Meteorological Office (IMO) statement.It opened up around midday local time (1200 GMT), the IMO added.Live television footage on state broadcaster RUV showed small amounts of smoking orange magma on the ground. The new stream of lava is running down into another valley, called Merardalir.Images released by Iceland's Civil Protection office showed a long, thin stream of magma flowing down through the hills for hundreds of metres from the new fissure, the whole scene shrouded in fumes.Initially the lava was moving at nearly 10 metres per second down the steep slope, "but it has slowed considerably now," vulcanologist Thorvaldur Thordarson told AFP."My feeling is that I don't see any sign of this stopping," Thordarson added. "We're going to see this for a while," said the vulcanologist, without hazarding a guess at the duration.The Meteorological Office said helicopters were making sure people had evacuated the site and that scientists were on their way to evaluate the crack.The authorities have sealed off access to the volcano site as a precaution and begun evacuating sightseers, said the IMO. People have been flocking there to see the spectacle since the eruption began on March 19.Icelandic experts, who initially thought the eruption near Mount Fagradalsfjall would be a short-lived affair, now think it could last several weeks or more. The volcano lies just 40 kilometres (25 miles) from the capital Reykjavik.While Iceland has more active volcanoes than any other country in Europe, the Reykjanes peninsula has not experienced an eruption since the 13th century -- although that one lasted about 30 years, from 1210 to 1240.At the last count by Iceland's tourism board, 36,293 people had by Sunday visited the site, where lava has been pouring from two small craters, covering almost 30 hectares (74 acres).In 2010 an eruption at the Eyjafjallajokull volcano sent huge clouds of smoke and ash into the atmosphere, disrupting air traffic for more than a week and cancelling more than 100,000 flights worldwide, which left some 10 million passengers stranded.str-map/pvh/tgb||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-lava-stream-flows-from-iceland-volcano-101617680382380.html

Congressman Steve Chabot is the other co-chair.As co-chairs of the Indian Caucus, Chabot and “I am dedicated to advancing the US-India defence relationship, particularly in support of maintaining a free and open Indo-Pacific,” Sherman said.The Defence Ministry said that Indian Navy Ships INS Satpura (with an integral helicopter embarked) and INS Kiltan along with P8I Long Range Maritime Patrol Aircraft are participating, for the first time; in multi-lateral maritime exercise La Pérouse, being conducted in the Eastern Indian Ocean Region from April 5 to 7.The Indian Navy ships and aircraft will exercise at sea with ships and aircraft of the French Navy (FN), Royal Australian Navy (RAN), Japan Maritime Self Defence Force (JMSDF) and the United States Navy (USN) during the three-day exercise at sea, it said.The exercise La Pérouse, led by the French Navy, has participation by FN Ships Tonnerre, an amphibious assault ship and frigate Surcouf. United States Navy is represented in the exercise by amphibious transport dock ship Somerset.Her Majesty’s Australian Ships (HMAS) Anzac, a frigate and tanker Sirius have been deployed by RAN for participation in the exercise while Japan Maritime Self Defence Ship (JMSDF) is represented by the destroyer Akebono. In addition to the ships, integral helicopters embarked onboard ships will also participate in the exercise.Exercise La Pérouse will witness complex and advanced naval operations including surface warfare, anti-air warfare and air defence exercises, weapon firing exercises, cross deck flying operations, tactical manoeuvres and seamanship evolutions such as replenishment at sea.The exercise will showcase high levels of synergy, coordination and inter-operability between the friendly navies. Participation by the Indian Navy in the exercise demonstrates the shared values with friendly navies ensuring freedom of seas and commitment to an open, inclusive Indo-Pacific and a rules-based international order.The evolving situation in the Indo-Pacific region in the wake of China's increasing military muscle-flexing has become a major talking point among leading global powers. The US has been favouring making Quad a security architecture to check China's growing assertiveness.China is engaged in hotly contested territorial disputes in the South and East China Seas. Beijing has also made substantial progress in militarising its man-made islands in the past few years.Beijing claims sovereignty over all of the South China Sea. But Vietnam, Malaysia, the Philippines, Brunei and Taiwan have counterclaims. In the East China Sea, China has territorial disputes with Japan.Both maritime areas in the South and East China seas are rich in minerals, oil and other natural resources and are also vital to global trade.In November 2017, India, Japan, the US and Australia gave shape to the long-pending proposal of setting up the Quad to develop a new strategy to keep the critical sea routes in the Indo-Pacific free of any influence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-congressman-lauds-quad-plus-france-naval-drill-in-bay-of-bengal-101617672877130.html
06-04-2021||World||US Supreme Court sides with Google in copyright fight with Oracle||Technology companies sighed with relief Monday after the Supreme Court sided with Google in a copyright dispute with Oracle. The high court said Google did nothing wrong in copying code to develop the Android operating system now used on most smartphones.To create Android, which was released in 2007, Google wrote millions of lines of new computer code. It also used about 11,500 lines of code copyrighted as part of Oracle's Java platform. Oracle had sued seeking billions.But the Supreme Court sided 6-2 with Google, describing the copying as “fair use.” The outcome is what most tech companies -- both large and small -- had been rooting for. Both Microsoft and IBM were among the industry heavyweights that had filed briefs backing Google in the case. They and others warned that ruling against the Mountain View, California-based company could have profound consequences, stifling innovation and upending software development.Oracle had won backing from the movie and recording industries as well as publishers, which favor expansive copyright protections to protect their profits from books, articles, movies, TV shows and music. The Trump administration had also backed Oracle.In his opinion for the court's majority, Justice Stephen Breyer wrote that Google "took only what was needed" and that “Google’s copying was transformative," a word the court has used "to describe a copying use that adds something new and important.”Google had said its actions were long-settled, common practice in the industry, a practice that has been good for technical progress. It said there is no copyright protection for the purely functional, noncreative computer code it used, something that couldn’t be written another way. But Austin, Texas-based Oracle argued Google “committed an egregious act of plagiarism."The case has been going on for a decade. Google won the first round when a judge rejected Oracle’s copyright claim, but that ruling was overturned on appeal. A jury then sided with Google, but an appeals court again disagreed.Breyer wrote that in reviewing the lower court's decision, the justices assumed “for argument’s sake, that the material was copyrightable.”"But we hold that the copying here at issue nonetheless constituted a fair use. Hence, Google’s copying did not violate the copyright law,” he wrote.At one point in the decision, Breyer used a recipe-finding robot as part of an analogy to explain how code works. At another point, he invoked a one-sentence short story to acknowledge that copying a small amount could still be significant. Breyer included both the story, originally in Spanish, and its translation: “When he awoke, the dinosaur was still there.”Justice Clarence Thomas wrote in a dissent joined by Justice Samuel Alito that he believed "Oracle’s code at issue here is copyrightable, and Google’s use of that copyrighted code was anything but fair.”Only eight justices heard the case because it was argued in October, after the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg but before Justice Amy Coney Barrett joined the court.In a statement, Google's chief legal officer, Kent Walker, called the ruling a “victory for consumers, interoperability, and computer science." “The decision gives legal certainty to the next generation of developers whose new products and services will benefit consumers,” Walker wrote.Oracle's chief legal officer, Dorian Daley, condemned the outcome. “The Google platform just got bigger and market power greater. The barriers to entry higher and the ability to compete lower. They stole Java and spent a decade litigating as only a monopolist can," she wrote in a statement.Oracle’s dogged pursuit of a case had been widely derided by other technology companies as a gross misapplication of copyright law. They argued it threatened to make it more difficult for different computer programs to work together and could stifle innovation among startups that might not be able to pay royalties for a few strands of coding.The founder of Privacy Lab at Yale Law School, Sean O’Brien, said both amateur and professional software developers will now “sleep a little easier without worrying that innovation and collaboration would be handcuffed by new restrictions.”The Computer & Communications Industry Association, a major trade group, was among the technology voices celebrating the Supreme Court’s decision. The court decision will also be welcome news to independent software developers, small startups and others who are tinkering with code, said Tiffany Li, a visiting law professor at Boston University.“This decision probably won’t change how startups and software developers operate. It just kind of confirms how they’ve been operating already,” Li said, adding that if Oracle had won that could have harmed a lot of developers because it would have been contrary to how the community currently functions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-supreme-court-sides-with-google-in-copyright-fight-with-oracle-101617669333739.html

About 400 will be trained in time to start flying again this summer, the company said. Southwest Airlines Co., meanwhile, said 209 pilots will return from voluntary leave on June 1.The pilot recalls show how U.S. airlines are stepping up efforts to prepare for a potentially busy summer as more people receive Covid-19 vaccinations. United Airlines Holdings Inc. said last week it would hire 300 new pilots, underscoring the dramatic reversal for an industry that a year ago was slashing payrolls through buyouts, early retirement and temporary leave programs.More than 1.5 million passengers passed through domestic security checkpoints April 4, compared with just 122,029 a year earlier. United and American Airlines Group Inc. have said their planes are about 80% full.Delta’s reliability will improve this spring and summer “as more of our workforce becomes vaccinated and more pilots return to active flying,” the company said in an emailed statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-airlines-bringing-back-more-pilots-as-travel-demand-rebounds-101617669175556.html
06-04-2021||World||US President Biden likely to name Evercore’s Bianchi as trade deputy||President Joe Biden is likely to name longtime aide and Obama administration veteran Sarah Bianchi as deputy U.S. trade representative, according to people familiar with the matter.Bianchi is a senior managing director at Evercore ISI International and has previously worked for BlackRock Inc. and Airbnb Inc. She is also chair on the advisory board of the Biden Institute at the University of Delaware.A decision isn’t final and Bianchi is still being vetted, the people said. They asked not to be identified because her nomination hasn’t been announced.During the second term of the Obama administration, Bianchi served as deputy assistant to the president for economic policy and director of policy for then-Vice President Biden.Spokespeople for the White House and USTR didn’t respond to requests for comment. Bianchi declined to comment.If confirmed by the Senate, Bianchi would work under Biden’s trade representative, Katherine Tai, who was sworn in last month and has promised that the agency would promote American workers. The trade agency has multiple deputy representatives and it’s not yet clear which portfolio Bianchi will supervise, the people said.Bianchi would help “reset the trade agenda with China and ensure a results-oriented approach,” said Michael Wessel, a commissioner with the U.S.-China Economic & Security Review Commission. “The Chinese and others would know that she speaks with authority, as she has been a long-time member of the president’s inner circle.”Biden’s trade office must tackle a long list of disputes that began under President Donald Trump, ranging from enforcement of a China trade deal to national security tariffs on European steel and aluminum.Biden himself has declined to say whether he will keep in place Trump’s remaining tariffs on more than $300 billion in Chinese imports and if he will build on the phase one trade agreement Trump signed with Beijing.The president’s team is still reviewing policies put in place under Trump and has not yet determined which it will adopt.But the new U.S. administration has made clear it will depart from unilateralism and has already engaged with allies in Europe and Asia to cooperate on confronting challenges like China and climate change.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-president-biden-likely-to-name-evercore-s-bianchi-as-trade-deputy-101617667439546.html
06-04-2021||World||Biden's economic plan gets boost from Senate procedural ruling||The prospects for President Joe Biden’s economic agenda could be enhanced by a ruling from the Senate parliamentarian that opens the door to passing multiple additional bills this year without any Republican support.A spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said Monday that Parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough has ruled Democrats could enact another reconciliation package by revising the budget blueprint the Democratic Congress adopted earlier this year.The ruling “allows Democrats additional tools to improve the lives of Americans if Republican obstruction continues,” said the spokesman, Justin Goodman.Goodman said no decisions have been made on how to move Biden’s agenda, but called the decision nonetheless “an important step forward” and “that this key pathway is available to Democrats if needed.”Senate Finance Chairman Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat, praised the rulling. ”The American people want bold action to address our country’s many challenges, and Democrats now have more options to overcome Republican obstruction and get things done,” he said in a statement on Monday evning.Biden’s $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package passed using the budget reconciliation process, which bypasses the 60-vote rule required to pass most legislation in the Senate.The president’s $2.25 trillion package has been dismissed out of hand by Republicans led by Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who has argued it’s too costly and would require huge tax increases.But even with the reconciliation tool available, Biden would still have to keep on board all 50 senators who caucus with Democrats in the 50-50 Senate, with Joe Manchin of West Virginia already insisting on changes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bidens-economic-plan-gets-boost-from-senate-procedural-ruling-101617666255623.html
06-04-2021||World||Putin signs law allowing him 2 more terms as Russia's leader||Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday signed a law allowing him to potentially hold onto power until 2036, a move that formalizes constitutional changes endorsed in a vote last year.The July 1 constitutional vote included a provision that reset Putin's previous term limits, allowing him to run for president two more times. The change was rubber-stamped by the Kremlin-controlled legislature and the relevant law signed by Putin was posted Monday on an official portal of legal information.The 68-year-old Russian president, who has been in power for more than two decades — longer than any other Kremlin leader since Soviet dictator Josef Stalin — said he would decide later whether to run again in 2024 when his current six-year term ends.He has argued that resetting the term count was necessary to keep his lieutenants focused on their work instead of “darting their eyes in search for possible successors.”The constitutional amendments also emphasized the primacy of Russian law over international norms, outlawed same-sex marriages and mentioned “a belief in God” as a core value. Nearly 78% of voters approved the constitutional amendments during the balloting that lasted for a week and concluded on July 1. Turnout was 68%.Following the vote, Russian lawmakers have methodically modified the national legislation, approving the relevant laws.The opposition criticized the constitutional vote, arguing that it was tarnished by widespread reports of pressure on voters and other irregularities, as well as a lack of transparency and hurdles hindering independent monitoring.In the months since the vote, Russia has imprisoned the country's most prominent opposition figure, Alexei Navalny,The 44-year-old Navalny was arrested in January upon his return from Germany, where he spent five months recovering from a nerve-agent poisoning that he blames on the Kremlin. Russian authorities have rejected the accusation.In February, Navalny was sentenced to 2 1/2 years in prison for violating the terms of his probation while convalescing in Germany. The sentence stems from a 2014 embezzlement conviction that Navalny has rejected as fabricated — and which the European Сourt of Human Rights has ruled to be unlawful.His team says Navalny had lost a substantial amount of weight even before he started a hunger strike Wednesday to protest authorities’ failure to provide proper treatment for his back and leg pains.Navalny complained about prison officials’ refusal to give him the proper medications and to allow his doctor to visit him. He also protested the hourly checks a guard makes on him at night, saying they amount to sleep deprivation.In an Instagram post Monday, Navalny said that three of 15 people in his room at the penal colony were diagnosed with tuberculosis. He noted that he had a strong cough and a fever of 38.1 Celsius (100.6 Fahrenheit).Later on Monday, the newspaper Izvestia carried a statement from the state penitentiary service saying Navalny was moved to the prison colony's sanitary unit after a checkup found him having “signs of a respiratory illness, including a high fever.”In an acerbic note, Navalny said he and other inmates studied a notice on tuberculosis prevention that underlined the importance of strengthening immunity with a balanced diet — advice that contrasted with a prison ration of “glue-like porridge and frozen potatoes.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/putin-signs-law-allowing-him-2-more-terms-as-russia-s-leader-101617665757581.html
06-04-2021||World||Minneapolis police chief testifies Chauvin violated policy in Floyd arrest||Derek Chauvin violated Minneapolis Police Department rules and its ethics code on respecting the "sanctity of life" during the deadly arrest of George Floyd last May, the city's police chief testified at the former officer's murder trial on Monday."It's not part of our training, and it is certainly not part of our ethics and our values," said Chief Medaria Arradondo, referring to how Chauvin, who is white, held his knee on the neck of Floyd, a 46-year-old Black man, for more than nine minutes. A bystander's video of Floyd's dying moments sparked global protests against police brutality.Over 3-1/2 hours of testimony, Arradondo disputed the defense's claim that Chauvin, who has pleaded not guilty to murder and manslaughter charges, was following the training he had received in his 19 years on the force.According to law experts who track police prosecutions, it is highly unusual for a city's senior police official to testify that one of his former subordinates used excessive force. Chauvin, who along with three other officers was fired by Arradondo a day after the arrest, sat nearby in a suit, taking notes.In opening statements last week, a prosecutor told the jury that it would hear from Arradondo, who would not "mince words." Last year, the chief released a statement castigating Chauvin, saying: "This was murder — it wasn't a lack of training."On Monday, he appeared dressed in a blue uniform, placed his chief's hat on a ledge in front of him with its golden badge visible to the jury, and spoke with his hands clasped in front of him."I vehemently disagree that that was appropriate use of force for that situation on May 25," he said.He said officers are trained to treat people with dignity and are sworn to uphold the "sanctity of life." They are trained in basic first aid and given annual refresher courses, be it in tying a tourniquet to a bleeding gunshot victim or using a naloxone inhaler to reverse an opioid overdose.Chauvin failed to follow his training in several respects, Arradondo said. He could tell from Floyd's grimaces that Chauvin was using more than the maximum "light-to-moderate" pressure an officer is allowed to use on someone's neck.The officer did not relent in using deadly force even as Floyd fell unconscious and he did not provide the mandated first aid to a dying Floyd, Arradondo said."It's contrary to our training to indefinitely place your knee on a prone, handcuffed individual for an indefinite period of time," he said, echoing testimony last week by the department's most senior homicide investigator who called Chauvin's use of force "totally unacceptable."In cross-examination, Eric Nelson, Chauvin's lead lawyer, began with getting Arradondo to say it had been "many years" since he himself had made an arrest."I'm not trying to be dismissive," Nelson said. He also had Arradondo agree with him that a police officer's use of force is often "not attractive."'HAVE YOU SEEN THE VIDEO?'Arradondo was at home on the night of Floyd's death when a deputy chief called him to say a "critical" situation appeared to have unfolded at the intersection outside a food store where Floyd was arrested on suspicion of using a counterfeit $20 bill to buy cigarettes.That Floyd was taken into custody at all was unusual, Arradondo said, given it was a non-violent misdemeanor. He said he called the state agency that investigates any case where police kill someone. He then called Mayor Jacob Frey, who in 2017 appointed Arradondo as the first Black person to lead the city's police, and headed downtown to his office in City Hall.The first video he saw, a long shot taken on a city surveillance camera across the street, did not show him much. But shortly before midnight, he got a call from someone "in the community.""They said almost verbatim: 'Have you seen the video of your officer choking and killing that man at 38th and Chicago?'" Arradondo recalled. "Eventually, within minutes of that, I saw for the first time what is now known as the bystander video."He could see how long Chauvin had kept Floyd pinned facedown, and concluded it was in breach of his department's "principles and values.""We are oftentimes the first face of government our community will see, and we will often meet them at their worst moments," Arradondo told the jury when asked by a prosecutor to describe the meaning of the badge the city's roughly 700 sworn officers wear. "That has to count for something."(Reporting by Jonathan Allen; Additional reporting by Brendan O'Brien in Chicago; Editing by Grant McCool and Peter Cooney)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/minneapolis-police-chief-testifies-chauvin-violated-policy-in-floyd-arrest-101617662875328.html
06-04-2021||World||Jailed Harvey Weinstein appeals sex crimes conviction||Jailed filmmaker Harvey Weinstein filed a long-expected appeal on his rape and sexual assault convictions Monday, kick-starting an attempt to have his 23-year prison sentence quashed.Lawyers for Weinstein, found guilty last year in a landmark verdict for the #MeToo movement, said in a New York court filing that the "Pulp Fiction" producer was denied a fair trial.They argue that several women who had accused Weinstein of sexual assault, but whose allegations were not included in the charges, should not have been allowed to testify as so-called prior bad acts witnesses."The American criminal justice system was designed to convict defendants based on their conduct -- not their general character," the attorneys wrote.Weinstein's lawyers also argue that the impartiality of the jury was compromised by a juror who had written a book about older men preying on younger women.The film producer's defense team had tried unsuccessfully to have her dismissed ahead of the trial."Based on the imminent publication of her book, she had a pecuniary motive to convict the defendant," the attorneys wrote.Weinstein, 69, was found guilty of a criminal sexual act in the first degree and rape in the third degree in February 2020. He was cleared of predatory sexual assault charges.Nearly 90 women, including Angelina Jolie and Salma Hayek, have leveled sexual misconduct allegations against Weinstein, the Oscar-winning producer of numerous hits including "Shakespeare in Love."But the trial focused on charges related to just two. Weinstein was convicted of raping ex-actress Jessica Mann in 2013 and of forcibly performing oral sex on former production assistant Mimi Haleyi in 2006.In the appeal, Weinstein's lawyers also accused Judge James Burke, who they repeatedly clashed with throughout the seven-week trial, of passing an "unduly harsh and excessive" sentence.Weinstein is being held at a maximum security prison in upstate New York.He is also awaiting trial in Los Angeles on rape and sexual assault charges involving five women.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/jailed-harvey-weinstein-appeals-sex-crimes-conviction-101617647833403.html

"But more importantly, what we have signaled with our Ukrainian partners is a message of reassurance."Pressed on whether the United States viewed troop movements on Russia's side of the border as intimidation of Ukraine, Price responded, "Of course, the Russians have for quite some time sought to intimidate and bully their neighbors."Ukraine, Western countries and NATO accuse Russia of sending troops and heavy weapons to prop up proxies who seized a swath of the eastern Donbas region in 2014. Moscow says it provides only humanitarian and political support to the separatists.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-asks-russia-to-explain-provocations-on-ukraine-border-state-department-101617645462774.html
06-04-2021||World||Jordan's King Abdullah accepts mediation with Prince Hamzah: Palace||Jordan's Prince Hamza pledged allegiance to King Abdullah on Tuesday after mediation by the royal family, two days after he was placed under house arrest and accused of trying to destabilise the country.Prince Hamza signed a letter in which he placed himself at the monarch's disposal after a meeting on Monday with Prince Hassan, the king's uncle, and other princes, the royal court said."I place myself in the hands of his majesty the king... I will remain committed to the constitution of the dear Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan," Prince Hamza said in the letter released by the palace.An earlier royal palace tweet said the king had entrusted Prince Hassan, also a former crown prince, to take charge of the matter and that Prince Hamza had agreed to family mediation over the affair.On Saturday, the military warned Prince Hamza over actions it said were undermining "security and stability" in Jordan, and he later said he was under house arrest. Several high-profile figures were also detained.Officials said on Sunday Prince Hamza had liaised with people who had contacts with foreign parties in a plot to destabilise Jordan, an important ally of the United States, and that he had been under investigation for some time.The half-brother of King Abdullah and former heir to the throne said in a voice recording released by Jordan's opposition on that he would not comply after being barred from any activity and told to keep quiet.While Prince Hamza is not seen as a direct threat to the king, his actions suggested he wanted to shore up his position with the Jordanian public after being removed from the royal succession."For sure I won't obey when they tell you that you cannot go out or tweet or reach out to people but are only allowed to see the family. I expect this talk is not acceptable in any way," he said in the recording circulated to friends and contacts.The intrigue shook Jordan's image as a haven of stability in the unpredictable Middle East.It is unclear why the kingdom decided to crack down on Prince Hamza now, but he put himself at growing risk by stepping up visits in recent weeks to tribal gatherings where the king and his government have been criticised more openly.Public anger has also increased since nine COVID-19 patients died when oxygen ran out in a newly built state hospital, exposing negligence blamed on official mismanagement and corruption. Protests were broken up with tear gas.The prince went to the homes of those who died to pay condolences, hoping to upstage the monarch who had earlier gone to the hospital to defuse anger, officials say. It was the first such open rift in the royal family in many years.PUBLIC FRUSTRATIONSKing Abdullah removed Prince Hamza from his position as heir to the throne in 2004.In a video passed to the BBC by Prince Hamza's lawyer on Saturday, the prince accused Jordan's leaders of corruption, apparently hoping to tap into the public's frustrations.Prince Hamza is not seen as a threat to the monarchy, which enjoys the support of the army and security services, but has gained sympathy among Jordanians sceptical of the government's accusations about his foreign links, saying it was a campaign to defame him."This is character assassination without evidence," said Ali R. al Tarawneh in a tweet.A supporter identified only as Razan said on Twitter there was "no good in a country that imprisons its prince."Others felt he was driven only by revenge at being sidelined and wanted to win popularity in tribal gatherings by emulating, in tone and language, his late father, who is revered by many Jordanians.Prince Hamza is the oldest son of the late King Hussein and his wife Noor, who had groomed him as a future monarch. He has served in the Jordanian armed forces.He angered the royal palace by trying to endear himself to a poor tribal constituency that has felt the impact of a shrinking economy and the state's inability to keep creating jobs that have long absorbed tribesmen in rural and Bedouin areas.Officials said between 14 and 16 people had been arrested in connection with the alleged plot.The state news agency said those arrested included Bassem Awadallah, a U.S.-educated confidant of the king who became minister of finance and adviser to Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, and royal family member Sharif Hassan Ben ZaidJordan's neighbours and allies have expressed solidarity with King Abdullah over the security measures in the kingdom.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/jordans-king-abdullah-accepts-mediation-with-prince-hamzah-palace-101617644927671.html

This was done o the instructions of Bombay high court, which passed an order in this regard on Monday.Deshmukh resigned on Monday after the order of the high court. In the resignation letter he sent to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, Deshmukh said that he doesn't feel morally right to continue in the post.He was replaced by fellow Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader Dinesh Walse Patil who said that the state government will move Supreme Court against the high court order. Deshmukh too is filing a petition separately in the Supreme Court.The Maharashtra government questioned the procedure adopted by the high court saying that the state was heard on the question of maintainability of the pleas seeking CBI investigation against Deshmukh on the allegation of corruption, and the order too was reserved on that issue, but the court finally ended up directing the probe.Also Read| Deshmukh’s exit: The start of Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi alliance’s troubles?In his appeal, Deshmukh said that the high court order raises issues of seminal importance which “impact not just the federal structure of the country, impact on our polity, but also the manner in which, and the institutions through which investigations are to be conducted”.He said that the court must have been aware of the fact that the Maharashtra government had withdrawn its consent for the CBI to investigate matters in the territory of the state.The high court order came on a petition filed by Param Bir Singh, who was shunted out as Mumbai Police commissioner during the probe into a security threat case involving billionaire Mukesh Ambani. A car was found near Antilia, Ambani's residence in Mumbai, with gelatin sticks after which a probe was launched into the bomb scare.Also Watch| ‘Uddhav has forfeited moral authority to govern’: BJP after Deshmukh resigns﻿﻿The case was later transferred to the National Investigation Agency (NIA), which arrested a Mumbai policeman Sachin Vaze.

His party too supported Deshmukh, but the opposition kept attacking the NCP leader demanding his resignation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cbi-registers-preliminary-enquiry-against-anil-deshmukh-101617730748013.html
06-04-2021||India||Covid-19: Centre says Maharashtra, Punjab, Chhattisgarh cause of maximum concern||The Centre said on Tuesday that Maharashtra, Punjab and Chhattisgarh are still the cause of maximum concern because of the high number of COVID-19 cases being reported there daily.At a press conference, Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan said the COVID-19 situation in Maharashtra is concerning because of its share in the total number of cases as well as in total deaths.The situation in Punjab and Chhattisgarh is worrying because of their share in the number of deaths, he said.Chhattisgarh's Durg is among the top 10 districts with high active COVID cases. Seven districts in Maharashtra, one in Karnataka and Delhi, taken as one district, is in list, Bhushan said.The 10 districts with the highest number of new cases are Pune, Mumbai, Thane, Nagpur, Nashik, Bengaluru Urban, Aurangabad, Ahmednagar, Delhi and Durg, he said.The average daily cases in Maharashtra has increased from 3,051 between February 10 and 16 to 44,624 between March 31 and April 6. Maharashtra accounts for 58 per cent of the cases being reported in the country.The average daily deaths have also increased from 32 between February 10 and 16 to 250 between March 31 and April 6. It has contributed to 34 per cent to total deaths.The states have been asked to increase the rate of RT-PCR tests. This number is falling in Maharashtra in the last few weeks, from 71.6 per cent between February 10 and 16 to 60.1 per cent between March 31 and April 6, Bhushan said.The weekly positivity rate in this period rose from 6.21 per cent to 24.41 per cent."We have recently told Maharashtra that mobile testing laboratories can be used in areas with difficult terrain for which ICMR is helping the state government."Chhattisgarh is a matter of concern as though it is a smaller state with less population, it accounts for six per cent of the total COVID cases in the country and three per cent of the deaths," Bhushan said.The condition of Chhattisgarh was not this serious during the first wave. But in second wave, it is not the just infections but even deaths are increasing, he said.The daily cases in Chhattisgarh has increased from 226 between February 10 and 16 to 4976 in March 31 and April 6. The average daily deaths have also increased from five on Febxruary 10 and 16 to 38 between March 31 and April 6The number of RT-PCR tests has been low.  From 35.2 per cent on Feb 10-16, it reduced to 30.6 per cent in March 31-April 6. We have requested the state government to increase the number of tests, he said.The weekly positivity rate during this period rose from 1.20 per cent to 16.71 per cent."If we look at Punjab, three per cent of the total cases are being reported from Punjab now and it accounts for 4.5 per cent of the total fatalities in the country,” he said.The daily cases in Punjab has increased from 240 between February 10 and 16 to 2793 between March 31 and April 6. The average daily deaths during the same periods have also increased from eight to 58.The average RT-PCR test is 76 per cent, which is satisfactory, the Union health secretary said, adding the weekly positivity rate in the period rose from 1.30 per cent to 8.75 per cent and to reduce that the number of tests have to be scaled up.The Centre has constituted 50 high-level multi-disciplinary public health teams and deployed them to districts reporting a surge in cases and mortality in Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh and Punjab, Bhushan said.These teams were being deployed in 30 districts of Maharashtra, 11 of Chhattisgarh and nine of Punjab. They will assist the state health department and local authorities in COVID-19 surveillance, control and containment measures."They will see how we can streamline testing, make effective contact tracing including surveillance and containment, build hospital infrastructure, including ICU, ventilator and oxygen beds and effective enforcement of COVID-appropriate behavior and vaccination," Bhushan added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-centre-says-maharashtra-punjab-chhattisgarh-cause-of-maximum-concern-101617729998801.html
06-04-2021||India||No plan to end Kumbh Mela despite rise in Covid-19 cases||Despite the spike in Covid-19 cases, the Union Health Ministry does not plan to end the holy congregation, Kumbh Mela in Haridwar, prematurely and is hoping that standard operating procedures (SOPs) are being followed there.On being asked if Kumbh Mela can be a super-spreader of Covid-19, Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan said, "As the super spreader events are concerned, the union government almost a month ago issued an SOP, specifically for practices to be adopted in Kumbh and had a long meeting with the state government's officers.""One fact that we usually lose sight of is that the duration of Kumbh has already been curtailed, Kumbh wherever it happens is usually for three and a half to four months, the present Kumbh has been curtailed to a month," he added.Dr VK Paul, the Member (Health) of the NITI (National Institution for Transforming India) Aayog said, "We hope that the Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) issued for Kumbh Mela is being followed."A senior official in the Central government, during a Secretary-level meeting over the Covid-19 situation in the country on Monday, expressed apprehension that the ongoing Kumbh might become a "super spreader", according to a top source in the government.The source said the government is worried about the Kumbh and discussed this at a high-level meeting on Monday."If the government does not decide to end Kumbh before the stipulated time, it may become a Covid-19 'super spreader'," a member in the high-level meeting said."The government is forming a team that will appeal to all with the help of sadhus and religious leaders to ensure pilgrims, who are visiting the Kumbh, wear masks and follow social distancing," the source told ANI.Kumbh is held periodically at four different locations in India -- Nashik, Haridwar, Prayagraj, and Ujjain -- every four years.In normal circumstances, Kumbh continues for nearly four months but this year due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the duration of the congregation has been curtailed to one month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-plan-to-end-kumbh-mela-despite-rise-in-covid-19-cases-101617729737359.html
06-04-2021||India||Second wave of bird flu kills hundred birds in Himachal Pradesh||Around 100 migratory birds have been found dead in Pong Dam Lake in the last two weeks after the outbreak of a second wave of bird flu in Himachal Pradesh, wildlife officials said on Tuesday.Bird flu had first been confirmed among migratory water-birds at Pong Dam Lake Wildlife Sanctuary in early January that left around 5,000 birds dead in a month. It was contained in early February but has now resurfaced since late March beginning with the discovery of a dozen bird carcasses in the sanctuary on March 25, they added.Chief Wildlife Warden Archana Sharma said the National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases (NIHSAD) in Bhopal has confirmed the presence of H5N8 avian influenza among the samples of the dead birds.This strain is different from the previous outbreak, when H5N1 had been detected among the migratory birds, she said adding that both these strains are highly pathogenic.Highly pathogenic subtypes of the avian influenza virus are known as highly contagious among birds and especially deadly for the poultry.Earlier this year, when bird flu outbreaks were reported across India, most of the states including neighbouring Haryana reported the H5N8 subtype of the virus, a strain which has not been known to infect humans.As of Tuesday, 99 birds have been found dead at Pong Dam lake during this resurgence, she added.Like the previous outbreak, most of the victims are bar-headed geese, she said adding that the dead birds also include nine greylag geese.The outbreak has so far been confined to two adjoining forest beats and bird fatalities are higher during days of adverse weather because that is when the geese tend to flock together instead of flying out, leading to more transmission of the virus, she added.An international Ramsar site with an area that extends up to 220 square kilometres during the wet season, the Pong wetland becomes home to flocks of migratory waterfowl each winter when wetlands in Europe, north and central Asia become frozen. A bird census in the sanctuary in February revealed the presence of over one lakh migratory water birds of 51 different species at the lake, including over 40 thousand bar-headed geese.With the onset of summer, the migratory birds are now flying back to their parent wetlands, she added.Many of the birds currently present in the lake are those which have flown from Rajasthan and other parts of the country, stopping here on their northward journey, she added.Some incidents of deaths of other birds have also been reported from other parts of the state, including Theog in Shimla district and Manali in Kullu district, and their samples have been taken for testing by the animal husbandry department.Meanwhile the sanctuary has again been closed for visitors, and the bird flu action plan has been activated, which includes surveillance, testing and scientific disposal of dead birds, she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2nd-wave-of-bird-flu-kills-hundred-birds-in-himachal-pradesh-101617729896609.html
06-04-2021||India||‘World’s two biggest democracies should join hands on confronting climate change’: John Kerry||US Special Presidential Envoy for Climate, John Kerry, called on India to join hands with the US to confront the climate crisis through a clean energy transition.“Our two nations, the world’s two biggest democracies have a great deal to gain by joining hands and global leadership to confront climate change now. We must do this,” Kerry said in his address to the South Asia Women in Energy (SAWIE) Leadership Summit.Earlier in the day, Kerry met Union environment minister Prakash Javadekar regarding increasing climate ambition ahead of President Biden’s Leaders’ Summit on Climate to be held on April 22-23.“Had an engaging and fruitful discussion with Mr John Kerry. Special Presidential Envoy for Climate. We discussed a range of issues including climate finance, joint research and collaboration etc,” Javadekar tweeted after the meeting.During his stay till Thursday, Kerry is likely to meet PM Modi, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, petroleum and natural gas minister Dharmendra Pradhan, minister for external affairs S Jaishankar.In his address to the SAWIE summit, Kerry summed up his expectations from India. He also acknowledged the US’ role in historical emissions leading to the climate crisis.“Decisive action by India will determine what this sustainable transformation will mean for generations to come. India has the opportunity to both elevate women’s empowerment and to avoid the mistakes made by other countries like ours. Instead of building a modern and sustainable society that can be the envy of the world, some of us have contributed too much to the problem that we are living through today. We are working to build back better today in the US, to transform our economy in a way that prevents the impending climate crisis by keeping global warming under 1.5 degrees C and also create cutting edge jobs of the future,” he said.Also read: ‘Red hot investment’ - US Envoy John Kerry lauds India’s energy policyBut Kerry also underlined the need for a quicker clean energy transition and phasing out of coal. “India has an advantage that we didn’t have in the US. Not just the benefits of decades of scientific and technical advancement but you also have the US as your friend and partner. We are here to support you on this path. India’s global leadership has been critical on a range of issues including delivering covid vaccines to the world. But I am particularly grateful that India is getting the job done on climate, pushing the curve, you are indisputably a world leader already in the deployment of renewable energy and your leadership on the International Solar Alliance promises to advance clean energy across India and other dynamic growing economies,” he said.While lauding PM Modi’s announcement of achieving the target of 450 GW renewable energy by 2030, Kerry said it’s cheapest to build solar in India and that he wants to see India as the cleantech hub of Asia. “The International Energy Agency (IEA) special report said you (India) are on pace to become the global market leader on solar and storage by 2040. It’s already cheaper to build solar in India than anywhere else in the world. That kind of urgency is exactly what we need to confront global climate change. We are in the decisive decade for action,” Kerry stated.Kerry said a zero-emissions future holds huge business opportunity. Global investment in new clean power capacity is said to exceed 10 trillion dollars through mid-century, more than 6 times the investment in dirtier options. “Still a net-zero energy transition will require innovation and scaling up. It’s critical that the US, India and other partners build the enhanced clean industries of the future - decarbonised industries… In 2021 we have a rare opportunity to create new technologies and new markets and India is seizing this opportunity,” Kerry said, adding that India could add half a million additional jobs by 2030 if it pursues clean energy transition aggressively.Underling the urgency of the climate crisis, Kerry said to get where we need to go according to the Paris Agreement and as per the scientists to keep global warming under 1.5 degrees C, we need to phase out coal five times faster than we have been, we need to increase tree cover five times faster, ramp up renewable energy six times faster.According to senior environment ministry officials, one of the key objectives of Kerry’s visit is to get India to join the countries that have announced a target to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. In September 2020, China announced that it will peak its GHG emissions by 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060. The White House announced on January 27 that President Joe Biden will take steps to put the United States (US) on an “irreversible path” to a net-zero economy by 2050. Consequently, Biden has also called for a summit of major emitting nations on April 22 to persuade them to commit to ambitious mitigation targets.“A net-zero target is not a trivial endeavour for any country, especially for a lower-middle-income country like India that has the dual challenge of providing modern energy services to millions while protecting the environment. We will need several technologies to become better and cheaper - energy storage, faster EV charging, fuel cells, hydrogen electrolysers, agricultural technologies, carbon capture, and direct air capture - which will be absolutely crucial to achieving any net-zero target. Public and private partnerships with the US can play a very important role in technological innovation and adaptation to India’s needs. The quest for a net-zero emissions future could bring new jobs and better health for Indians. But much depends on the infusion of international capital and disruptive technologies,” said Ulka Kelkar, director, climate at World Resources Institute.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/worlds-two-biggest-democracies-should-join-hands-on-confronting-climate-change-john-kerry-101617729381085.html

06-04-2021||India||In latest ordinance, Congress sees ‘terrible breach of trust’||An ordinance to end part of India’s appellate structure has irked Congress with party leaders dashing out letters to protest “a terrible breach of trust”. They also wondered if “anything better” be expected from the NDA government. At the heart of the conflict is The Tribunals Reforms (Rationalisation and Conditions of Service) Ordinance that was promulgated on Sunday. Congress chief whip in Rajya Sabha Jairam Ramesh claimed that NDA’s parliament managers had assured the Opposition during the budget session that the bill would be sent to a standing committee for review. In a letter to the Rajya Sabha chairman, Ramesh said, “I am not writing to you on the merits of the ordinance. All I wish to do is express my disgust at the terrible breach of faith as far as not referring the bill to the standing committee concerned.”The legislation, piloted by finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, aims to dissolve at least eight existing appellate tribunals and transfer their responsibilities to other bodies including high courts. Jairam claimed that when the budget session was drawing to a close, government managers informed him that the bill would not be taken up for passage and would be sent to a House panel. Congress leader Manish Tewari shot a similar letter to Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla and argued that chapter 12 of the bill introduces major amendments to section 184 of the finance bill and directly impacts the functioning and composition of 19 key tribunals. He added that the proposed law envisages a “complete control” over the mechanisms of 19 tribunals and said, “the bill must be referred to the standing committee for a thorough review of any inherent vulnerabilities in the proposed amendments. Given the sheer degree of dilution or modification that can be done through the misuse of this power, you will surely agree that the amendments should not be hurried and must be examined.”The NDA’s ordinance route and passing bills without review of parliamentary panels have been a matter of concern for the Opposition. PRS Legislative Research said in its report, “In the 17th Lok Sabha, so far, 11% of the introduced Bills have been referred to a committee; much lower than the 14th (60%), 15th (71%), and 16th (27%) Lok Sabhas.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-latest-ordinance-congress-sees-terrible-breach-of-trust-101617728000756.html

06-04-2021||India||As Mukhtar Ansari heads to Banda jail, his brother raises concern||Afzal Ansari, brother of gangster-turned-politician Mukhtar Ansari, raised questions about the intention of Uttar Pradesh government. Speaking about shifting of Mukhtar from Punjab's Rupnagar jail to UP's Banda, Afzal said he has full faith in the judiciary.Mukhtar is being shifted after an order of the Supreme Court to be tried for various criminal cases in Uttar Pradesh."Their intention is not right. In the same Banda jail, he (Mukhtar) was given poison in tea... we have full faith in the judiciary. We have moved a plea to provide medical facilities to him," Afzal Ansari was quoted as saying by news agency ANI."I am hopeful that Supreme Court will ensure that those in power don't kill someone. In a public rally, BJP state president announces 'gaadi UP ke kis border pe paltegi, ye nahi bataunga (I won't disclose on which border the car carrying Mukhtar will overturn)'. A minister says 'gaadi to palat ke rahegi (the car will definitely overturn)'," he added.The remarks were in reference to the killing of gangster Vikas Dubey in July last year. Dubey was gunned down by the police in an encounter after he “attempted to flee” while being brought to Kanpur from Madhya Pradesh’s Ujjain where he was arrested."If they do something arbitrarily, then the time for end of such dictators is nearing. Sacrifice is needed to end dictatorship. If such a thing happens, I will consider that Mukhtar has been sacrificed for the end of the dictatorial government," said Afzal Ansari.The Uttar Pradesh police on Tuesday took custody of Mukhtar Ansari, leaving with him from Punjab’s Rupnagar jail in a convoy headed 900 km away for a prison in Banda where security has been tightened to hold the gangster-turned-politician.The transfer happened after a bitter legal battle in the Supreme Court in which the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government in Uttar Pradesh accused the Congress government in Punjab of “shielding” Ansari for several months by not letting the state take custody.Ansari has been lodged in Rupnagar jail since January 2019 in connection with an extortion case.According to the UP police, Mukhtar Ansari faces 52 cases in the state - including murder, attempt to murder, cheating and conspiracy - and 15 of them are at the trial stage.Punjab's home department had asked the Uttar Pradesh government to take Ansari’s custody by April 8, following the March 26 Supreme Court order that had set a two-week deadline.Ansari will be kept in barrack number 15 of the Banda district jail when he reaches there on Wednesday morning, an official said. He added that access to the barrack has been denied to other jail inmates.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mukhtar-ansari-was-given-poison-in-banda-jail-says-his-brother-101617723627106.html
06-04-2021||India||India could resume vaccine exports by June, says SII CEO Adar Poonawalla||The world's largest vaccine maker, based in India, will be able to restart exports of AstraZeneca doses by June if new coronavirus infections subside in the country, its chief executive said Tuesday.But a continued surge could result in more delays because the Serum Institute of India would have to meet domestic needs, Adar Poonawalla warned in an interview with The Associated Press.The company is a key supplier for the UN-backed COVAX program that aims to distribute vaccines equitably in the world. On March 25, COVAX announced a major setback in its vaccine rollout because a surge in infections in India caused the Serum Institute of India to cater to domestic demand, resulting in a delay in global shipments of up to 90 million doses.Since then, daily new infections in India have almost doubled, with the biggest single-day spike of over 100,000 new cases on Monday. Infections are being reported faster in India than anywhere else in the world, prompting tougher virus restrictions in New Delhi and its financial capital, Mumbai.India initially immunized the most vulnerable, but broadened that to anyone over 45 on April 1 because of the surge in cases. The resulting increased demand forced the halt in exports. Since then, several top state officials have urged the federal government to further expand vaccinations.Poonawalla said the company has “chosen to prioritize India temporarily for two months” and hopes to then restart exports.If India's surge in infections doesn't subside, "I am scared of what ... we will have to do, and what will happen,” he said. “We are going to have to keep supplying to India, and not anywhere else. Because we have to protect our nation.”He acknowledged that has put a “strain on our contractual obligations” to provide vaccines to other countries, and that he has been fielding phone calls from various heads of state.“I've had to politely explain to everybody the situation,” he said, adding that most world leaders understood because they were facing the same issues — the needs of domestic politics and questions raised by opposition parties and the public.“Nationalism is happening ... to a certain extent, everywhere,” Poonawalla said, pointing to vaccine export controls imposed by Europe, and the use in the United States of the Defense Production Act to prevent exports of critical raw materials needed to scale up vaccine manufacturing.He said the unavailability of these raw materials, such as the specific medium needed to grow microorganisms, could affect the Serum Institute's production of another vaccine, Novavax, which is still being tested in India. It has signed a deal to supply Novavax to COVAX, but pivoting to different suppliers of the raw materials would result in a delay of five to six months, he said.“The crunch ... for supplies is today," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-could-resume-vaccine-exports-by-june-says-sii-ceo-adar-poonawalla-101617722144658.html

As much as 60 per cent of the cases (in Gujarat) are from four major cities, including Surat."And, it seems that cases will increase further. But, people should not panic. People should take necessary precautions to stay safe," Rupani told reporters after the meet."People are complaining about a shortage of Remdesivir. My government has placed an order to procure 3 lakh Remdesivir injections from a Gujarat-based pharma company, which has already started supplying around 20,000 injections every day. There will not be any shortage now," he assured.The chief minister said his government has stepped up the vaccination drive as well as testing to curb the spread of the coronavirus infection.Around 1.2 lakh persons are now being tested for coronavirus across the state daily, while an average 4 lakh beneficiaries are being covered under the vaccination drive per day, said Rupani.He said Surat will get 300 ventilators, 50 new 'Sanjeevani Rath' (medical) vans and 800 additional beds at Kidney Hospital for coronavirus patients.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-gujarat-government-orders-3-lakh-remdesivir-injections-101617719658646.html

You (India) are indisputably a world leader already in the deployment of renewable energy," Kerry said. Kerry was speaking in Delhi, where he held talks with government leaders as part of a diplomatic effort to get countries to commit themselves to net zero carbon emissions and slow down global warming."India, in particular, is a red hot investment opportunity because of its clean energy transition. Indian industry is already stepping up and demonstrating leadership," US envoy was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.Kerry pointed out how a recent International Energy Agency's special report on India noted that that the country is on pace to become global market leader in solar and storage by 2040. "Thanks to your rapid scale-up, it is already cheaper to build solar energy in India than anywhere else in the world," Kerry said.Kerry was accompanied by a seven-member US delegation in the talks, an environment ministry official said.Praising Prime Minister Narendr Modi's policy goals on renewable energy by 2030, Kerry said that the announcement of a target of 450 GW of renewables by 2030 sets a very strong example of power how to power a growing economy with clean energy.Decisive action by India, Kerry said, in partnership with the rest of the world will determine what this transformation will mean for generations to come.Striking a comparision between US and India, Kerry said that India has an advantage that US did not have during the developing stage. "Not just benefits of decades of scientific and technical advancement, you also have US as your friend and partner. We're here to support you through this path of sustainable future," Kerry said.Backing India's efforts across the spectrum globally, Kerry said that the country's global leadership has been critical across a range of issues including delivering Covid-19 vaccines to world.This is also Kerry's first visit to India as the US Special Envoy for Climate Change. In January, the Biden administration had re-joined the Paris Agreement.The visit aims at consultations on increasing climate ambition ahead of Biden's Leaders' Summit on Climate scheduled for April 22-23 and the COP26 meet to be held later this year.US President Biden has invited 40 world leaders, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, to a US-hosted virtual summit on climate to underscore the urgency and the economic benefits of stronger climate action.This will be the second time PM Modi and US President Biden will be together at a virtual summit after last month's Quad meeting.According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), India is the third-largest global emitter of carbon dioxide, after China and the US, despite extremely low per capita CO2 emissions.It has set a target of achieving 175GW (gigawatt) of renewable energy capacity by 2022 and 450GW by 2030.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/red-hot-investment-us-envoy-john-kerry-lauds-india-s-energy-policy-101617717156550.html

Harsh Vardhan told the health ministers that if people adhere to Covid-19 preventative measures then the recent surge of the infection can be contained.Watch Now!Union Minister Dr Harsh Vardhan holds a VC with Health Ministers of 11 states to review the #COVID19 situation & actions being taken to address rising cases in the country.@PMOIndia @MoHFW_INDIA https://t.co/vKe6m14EnxHealth ministers of Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Delhi, Gujarat, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab and Rajasthan attended the virtual meeting on Tuesday.Harsh Vardhan said, “We are still in control of the situation. The strategy that led to decline of cases earlier in February this year, when the nation reported 8,635 cases, if we revisit the strategy then we may be able to contain this current spike in the number of Covid-19 cases. We need to motivate society to follow Covid-19 appropriate behaviour.”The Union health minister pointed out that the steep rise that was reported since February came from these 11 states and UTs. Vardhan also said that Chattisgarh remains one of the worst-affected states. He said that Durg and Raipur in Chhattisgarh are badly affected as the positivity rate in these two districts have gone up to 20%. The minister also talked about Haryana’s small towns which he said are badly affected by the latest surge. Harsh Vardhan said that the UK variant contributed to a surge in Covid-19 cases across Punjab, along with events like marriages and local body polls.He also said that the Centre has sent 50 teams to Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh and Punjab - the three states where Covid-19 is wreaking havoc. He said that 30 teams will be stationed in Maharashtra, while districts in Punjab and Chhattisgarh which are reporting a surge in cases will be under the supervision of 9 and 11 teams respectively. The teams will focus on implementing the testing, tracking, treating, vaccination and strategies to ensure strict adherence to Covid-19 protocol among people. The teams will report to the state and Centre with their recommendations on a daily basis.“Following gradual reopening of services, people took a casual approach towards following Covid-19 appropriate behaviour which has led to a surge in the number of cases. There were elections held previously, elections are also being held currently, there are Kumbh festivities going on, offices have reopened in several cities and social functions like marriages and other events have been taking place in higher frequency where people have not followed Covid-19 appropriate behaviour,” the health minister said.The health minister also pointed out that he has personally also seen people not wearing masks while they were outside. He said that there are several ‘social vaccines’ like proper usage of masks and hand sanitisers which are available along with the real vaccines "so taking care of the surge should not pose a major challenge if people can be forced to follow these rules".India witnessed the highest surge in daily cases on Monday when the daily caseload crossed 100,000-mark. India currently has 788,233 active cases and the death toll has reached 165,547 with 446 fresh fatalities reported on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/health-minister-says-current-surge-can-be-contained-if-people-follow-rules-101617718613565.html
06-04-2021||India||India won't open Covid-19 vaccination for all. Official explains why||Caught in a highly infectious wave of coronavirus disease (Covid-19), India launched a nationwide vaccination in January this year. As pointed out by experts, vaccination is India's artillery against the viral contagion which has infected more than 12.5 million in the country.The strategy has been relied upon by chief ministers of all states who have also asked for increasing the ambit of the vaccinating programme. However, the Centre differs and has firmly stated that these drives will not be opened for all.Explaining it further, Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan said at a weekly press briefing on Tuesday, "Many people ask why shouldn't we open vaccination for all. There are two aims of such vaccination drives - to prevent deaths and protect the healthcare system."The aim, Bhushan said, is not to administer the vaccine to those who want it but to those who need it. He later clarified his remark, saying the government was following a dynamic supply-demand mapping model.“The primary aim of vaccination is to reduce mortality among the most vulnerable class of people. Why did we prioritise some groups over others? Because in this phase of vaccination (till around July), vaccines will be in limited supply. Hence we have to prioritise it to the most vulnerable sections of society and this is an established practice across the world,” Bhushan told news agency ANI.Bhushan said that this prioritisation strategy of those more vulnerable is also backed by the WHO. "Along with the prioritisation, we are following a dynamic supply-demand mapping model to take decisions of when to open up vaccinations to other age groups," the Union health secretary said.Also read: BMC announces fresh Covid-19 restrictions for Mumbai, in addition to Maharashtra govt curbsIndia, currently in its third phase of Covid-19 vaccination, has started vaccinating people above the age of 45. In the first phase, which started on January 16, India inoculated healthcare workers with two vaccines - Covishield (Oxford-AstraZeneca's vaccine manufactured by Serum Institute of India) and Covaxin (manufactured by Bharat Biotech Limited). The drive was further opened up to 20 million frontline workers from February 1 onwards.In the next phase of the Covid-19 vaccination drive, authorities aimed to inoculate people above 60 years and those over 45 with comorbidities against the coronavirus from March 1.The vaccine drive was meant to first immunise 300 million people who belong to three categories: healthcare workers, frontline workers, and those at greater risk from Covid-19 due to their age or existing medical conditions.The clarification from officials came a day after Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi urging relaxation in the age bar and opening of new vaccination centres.In his letter, Kejriwal suggested a two-pronged approach. "First, there is an urgent need to increase the number of vaccination centers. For this, the pre-conditions placed by the Centre regarding vaccination centers need to be relaxed," he said."Second, it should be made available to everyone by removing the age limit to immunization. Except for those who cannot get vaccinated medically, we should start vaccinating everyone. This will remove the hesitation among people and increase the number of people getting vaccinated. The more people get vaccinated, the more we will be able to reduce the spread of the disease," he added.Also read | Covid-19 pandemic in India has worsened, warnings were given: GovtThackeray in his letter reasoned that the move will benefit Maharashtra - the worst-affected state - and those vaccinated by reducing the severity among the young and working population falling in that age bracket."I request you to lower it to 25, as the states facing the surge are having to place curbs to safeguard the lives of the population. However, if a larger number of our young and working population is vaccinated, the intensity of the cases would be much lower than the treatment that they need today," Thackeray said in his letter. A copy of the letter was shared by the chief minister's official Twitter account.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-won-t-open-covid-19-vaccination-for-all-officials-explain-why-101617711524277.html

06-04-2021||India||'Need for a lockdown': Gujarat HC tells state govt amid rising Covid-19 cases||After the High Court of Gujarat on Tuesday asked the state government to consider imposing a curfew for a few days as the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) situation was getting 'out of control', the government decided to impose night curfew and a few other measures effective from Wednesday. The night curfew will be from 8pm to 6am in 20 cities up to April 30. Only 100 people will be permitted in weddings and all political and social functions with more than 50 people have been banned till April 30. Additionally, all government offices will remain shut on Saturdays, the government notice said. Gujarat on Monday recorded over 3,000 fresh cases of the virus.During an online hearing, a bench of Chief Justice Vikram Nath and Justice Bhargav Karia said a lockdown or curfew for 3 to 4 days is needed to curb the spread of the virus. "Urgent and serious steps need to be taken to check this. Otherwise, the Covid-19 situation will go out of hand. May be three-four days of curfew or lockdown can be imposed to check the situation at the moment," Chief Justice Nath said, according to news agency PTI. All kinds of gatherings, including political functions, should be stopped, he added.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageThe night curfew imposed from between 9pm and 6am in four major cities of Gujarat was not proving to be effective, according to Chief Justice Nath. On March 31, night curfew in Ahmedabad, Surat, Vadodara and Rajkot was extended till April 15. This was the seventh extension of the night curfew, which first came into force in November 2020, after a spike in Covid-19 cases in these cities after Diwali. "You can always open it after three-four days of curfew. But, this curfew will help, I think. Like, initially in March 2020, there was a curfew for two days, three days," Chief Justice Nath said.Justice Karia said steps needed to be taken to reduce the number of people going to office in order to break the chain of infection. To make sure "less number of people come in contact" with each other, he suggested that the government should limit the number of employees coming to offices or commercial establishments.To these suggestions, Advocate General Kamal Trivedi said he will take instructions from the state government and revert, according to PTI. "Day before yesterday, the government was seriously thinking about imposing a lockdown. But, there were views that a lockdown is likely to cause misery to the poor people," the advocate general said, adding that the government is in a 'Catch-22' situation. (with agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/need-for-a-lockdown-gujarat-hc-tells-state-govt-amid-rising-covid-19-cases-101617711985275.html
06-04-2021||India||Bombay HC says ByteDance should deposit $11 million in tax evasion case||An Indian court on Tuesday said China's ByteDance must deposit around $11 million that federal authorities believe the company owes in an alleged case of tax evasion, a setback for the firm which wanted to unblock its bank accounts to pay salaries.An Indian tax intelligence agency in mid-March ordered HSBC and Citibank in Mumbai to freeze accounts of ByteDance India as it probed some of the firm's financial dealings. ByteDance challenged the move in court saying the freeze amounted to harassment and was done illegally.ByteDance has said in court it does not owe the tax government is demanding and does not agree with the tax authority's decision to freeze its accounts.After a government counsel said ByteDance owed the authorities about 790 million rupees ($11 million), the High Court in Mumbai said the company will need to keep that amount blocked in a state-run bank.That amount will be frozen, the two-judge bench said.However, the four blocked bank accounts of ByteDance had just $10 million in funds, according to the company's court filing seen by Reuters.A counsel for the federal tax authority, Jitendra Mishra, said ByteDance can utilize the $10 million for making the court mandated deposit, but cannot use it for any other activity. Effectively, Mishra said, the accounts still remain frozen until the amount is moved to the state-run bank.ByteDance did not immediately respond to a request for comment.ByteDance in January reduced its Indian workforce after New Delhi maintained a ban on its popular video app TikTok, imposed last year after a border clash between India and China. Beijing has repeatedly criticised India over that ban and those of other Chinese apps.Still, the company has told the court it has a workforce of 1,335, including outsourced personnel, which includes 800 people working in its "trust and safety" team that supports activities like content moderation overseas.In the tax probe, which started in July 2020, India's tax authority told ByteDance it had reasons to believe the company suppressed certain transactions and claimed excessive tax credits, Reuters has previously reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bombay-hc-says-bytedance-should-deposit-11-million-in-tax-evasion-case-101617711270253.html
06-04-2021||India||Post Quad summit, India-China military talks on LAC friction possible on April 9||The 11th round of India-China military dialogue may take place on April 9 to resolve the friction at Gogra-Hot Springs and restoring the pre-April 2020 status quo ante along the 1,597-kilometre Line of Actual Control(LAC) in East Ladakh, people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday. The Indian army also wants to resolve long-standing patrolling issues at Depsang Bulge due to friction in the area during the 2013 stand-off with the People’s Liberation Army (PLA).“The dialogue will most probably take place on Friday (April 9) but a confirmation is still awaited from the PLA side,” said a senior official. He, however, insisted that there is no delay from the Chinese side.While the situation on both banks of Pangong Tso is stable with the PLA and Indian Army going back to pre-April 2020 positions, a score of Chinese soldiers is still to restore status quo ante in the Gogra-Hot Springs area, or patrolling points 15 and 17 as per the Indian military lexicon.Also Read: ‘Build on Pangong Lake drawdown, disengage at other points’: India tells ChinaThe last round of military talks to resolve border tensions that began last May was held on February 20. This meeting stretched for 16 hours and ended with two sides agreeing that the Pangong Tso disengagement provided them with a “good basis” to resolve the outstanding issues at friction points in “a steady and orderly” manner.Indian Army commanders believe that the differences between the two sides at the Gogra-Hot Springs area was relatively a minor issue as compared to the diversion of views on the strategic heights on both banks Pangong Tso. But there is recognition that the talks could go either way though the army has approached the dialogue with an open mind.The 11th round of military talks comes at a time there is growing concern in China about the Quad security dialogue and the attempts to raise pressure on Beijing to loosen its hold over Taiwan and the South China Sea.Leaders of the four-member Quad grouping - the United States, India, Japan and Australia - held their first summit on March 12 to address concerns about Beijing’s growing economic and military heft. A meeting of US-China officials at Anchorage on March 18 also ended acrimoniously, making it clear that there was no possibility of a revival in US-China bilateral ties in a hurry despite the change in the White House.To add to China’s concern is the concerted effort by powers such as France and the United Kingdom to expand their footprint in the Indo-Pacific and India playing a pivotal role in the region, particularly in the Indian Ocean. Navies of France-plus Quad countries are already in the middle of exercises in the Bay of Bengal. with French carrier strike force led by aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle. The French nuclear-powered aircraft carrier will participate in the trilateral naval exercise along with the Indian and the United Arab Emirates navies in the strategically important Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman later this month.Officials suggest it is not clear these developments would impact the military talks.

06-04-2021||India||Covid-19 pandemic in India has worsened, warnings were given: Govt||The Union health ministry on Tuesday asked states badly hit by the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) to amp up their RT-PCR testing to at least 70% of the total samples tested. The suggestion comes a day after India recorded more than a lakh cases in a day - highest since the start of the pandemic.The health officials also confirmed that the second wave in India is worse than the first as the Covid-19 cases are increasing at a higher rate."The impact of the pandemic has increased in the country. Warnings were given that the situation should not be taken for granted," Dr VK Paul, NITI Aayog member said at a press conference.Dr Paul confirmed that the situation has worsened and the speed of increasing Covid-19 cases is higher than last time."We have suggested state governments increase the percentage of RT-PCR tests, which is reducing in Maharashtra in the last few weeks. Only 60% of total tests were done through RT-PCR method in Maharashtra last week. We suggest states take it to 70% or above," Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan said in a weekly press briefing.According to the officials, the deteriorating situation in Chhattisgarh has sent the alarm bells ringing as the state has become an area of "concern"."Chhattisgarh is a cause of concern for us. Despite being a small state, it reports 6% of total Covid-19 cases and 3% of total deaths in the country. The condition of Chhattisgarh has deteriorated in the second wave of infections," Bhushan said in the press briefing."Death numbers being reported in Punjab and Chhattisgarh are cause of extreme concern," he added.Maharashtra - India's worst affected state - accounts for 58% of the active cases and 34% of the total deaths, officials said. They added that around 4.5% of deaths due to the virus are being reported in Punjab."Compared to Punjab, active cases and death toll are very low in Delhi and Haryana. It is satisfactory that the share of RT-PCR tests in average daily tests has increased to 76% in Punjab," Bhushan said.Union health minister Harsh Vardhan is scheduled to hold a meeting with health ministers of 11 states and union territories (UTs) to take stock of the situation. Prime Minister Narendra Modi will also hold a meeting with chief ministers on Thursday to review the Covid-19 situation in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-pandemic-in-india-has-worsened-warnings-were-given-govt-101617706833277.html

If a student gets infected during the examination and dies, will the university take responsibility?,” asked a student, who didn’t wish to be named.Following the protest, the district administration called a meeting of Assam University officials, principals of colleges and representatives of students. The colleges unanimously supported the decision to conduct offline examinations. “Assam University is not the competent authority to assess the Covid situation. It is the district administration or the state government’s job to issue an advisory, which guides our decision. When the Dibrugarh University is conducting offline examination, the election commission is conducting elections, a Mela is happening in Silchar, when everything is open, how can Assam University take a decision not to conduct offline examination? We are following the Standard Operating Procedure (SOPs) issued by the ministry of home affairs, which instructs universities to open in a phase-wise manner,” said Pradosh Kiran Nath, Assam University registrar.Additional deputy commissioner Dipak Jidung said, “We cannot influence the university’s decision unless it hampers the law and order situation in our district. The university authority asked us to give an advisory whether it is unsafe to conduct offline examination at this moment due to Covid. Though the number of Covid cases are increasing in the country, we don’t have any instructions from the state government to stop offline examinations.”Presently, there are 16 active cases of Covid in Cachar district and the last death due the disease in the district was reported two weeks back.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-university-students-demand-for-online-examination-rejected-101617699738653.html

He also lashed out at regional parties and said the mask of “fake secularism” that they wear is now coming off. Taking a swipe at opponents who dub the BJP an election-winning machine, he said when other parties win elections, the party and the leaders are feted but in the case of the BJP, electoral wins are “perceived with double standards”. “Those who say we are an election-winning machine cannot understand the maturity of the Indian democracy and the intelligence of the voters; they cannot understand the hopes and aspirations of the Indian voters. The BJP is not an election-winning machine, but is on a continuous, relentless campaign to win hearts,” the PM said. Also Watch | ‘BJP means freedom from dynastic politics’: PM Modi on party’s foundation dayAddressing party workers, the PM said the BJP has ensured last-mile delivery of its people-centric policies and has taken into account the aspirations of the marginalised sections that were not at the centre of programmes initiated by previous governments. For the first time the yardstick has changed and the governments are evaluated on the basis of policies (neeti), intent (neeyat) and last-mile delivery, he said. “We serve the people faithfully whether in the government or not; we are connected with the people. We do not take pride that our party won; we take pride that the people of this country made us win,” he said. Taking another dig at regional satraps that have become “dynastic parties”, he said the parties that emerged as representatives of regional aspirations have now become “family-controlled” parties. “In this (BJP) party, workers toil hard and thousands of workers have made sacrifices...In Kerala and in West Bengal our workers are threatened, attacked and their families are also not spared… but they are steadfast in their resolve to live and die for the country, this is the uniqueness of the BJP workers. On the other hand, you have seen what happens to family and dynasty-oriented politics. The parties that talked about regional aspirations have eventually become a family-owned parties and the results are here for all to see. These parties wore a fake mask of secularism which is now being taken off,” he said. While the BJP’s opponents have accused it of not protecting the rights of the minorities and indulging in communal polarisation, the PM said secularism had been transformed to mean policies according to the vote bank and favours only for a few. “Those who makes policies and programmes for everyone and speak about the rights of all are called communal; but Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas and Sabka Vishwas has begun to change these definitions,” he said. Reiterating that the country is above all, he said the BJP has never compromised on its values and on issues of national security. “We saw how the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government accepted loss of power by one vote but did not compromise. Our workers suffered during the emergency,” he said. Cautioning workers against “narratives” that seek to create political instability in the country, he cited the examples of the protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act, the farm and labour laws. The PM was referring to the protests that erupted when Parliament passed the bill to fast track citizenship for persecuted minorities from the neighbouring countries and the bill to bring changes in the farm laws. “I want to take your attention towards a very grave challenge; you would have seen the system of creating narratives has started. [Whether it is] with regard to CAA or the farm laws or the labour laws, every worker should understand that there is politics behind this and a big conspiracy. This means there is an attempt to create political instability in the country, therefore all rumours are being spread, fears are being stoked and lies are being told. Imaginary fears are being created; sometimes it is said that the Constitution will be changed, sometimes that reservation will be withdrawn; sometimes they say citizenship will be withdrawn and sometimes they say farmers’ lands will be taken… all of these are lies but some people and organisations spread them with speed . You need to be alert and with complete information keep going back to the people and create awareness among the people,” the PM said. He said the work of creating fear and wrong narratives is the handiwork of those “who cannot accept their defeat and do this for their own political benefit”. The PM also urged the party members to be humble as the party grows in number and political heft. “We are moving ahead, taking along every region and community, we are everywhere. We are a party of national interest as well as regional aspirations. We do not believe in political untouchability,” he said. He cited how the BJP government paid tributes to Sardar Patel and BR Amedkar and did not refrain from awarding civil awards even to political opponents.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-is-not-an-election-winning-machine-pm-modi-on-party-s-foundation-day-101617693078290.html

The Prime Minister began the address by paying tribute to the leaders of the party such as Syama Prasad Mukherjee, Deen Dayal Upadhyay, Kushabhau Thackeray, Rajmata Scindia and Atal Bihari Vajpayee.The program began with the party president JP Nadda’s address, who celebrated the expansion of the BJP to 303 seats in the Parliament and forming a government in 12 states under the leadership of Prime Minister Modi.“The BJP has always worked on the mantra of 'the party is bigger than the individual' and the 'nation is bigger than the party'. This tradition has continued since Syama Prasad Mukherjee and runs to date,” PM Modi said during the address.Watch | ‘BJP means freedom from dynastic politics’: PM Modi on party’s foundation dayThe Prime Minister celebrated the BJP-led government’s achievements. From abrogation of Article 370 and giving constitutional rights to Jammu and Kashmir to fighting the Covid-19 pandemic, he spoke about how the party workers unitedly worked for the development of the nation.PM Modi slammed the opposition, on the foundation day that coincided with the polling day of four states and one Union territory, for calling the BJP an election-winning machine. He said if the BJP wins it is considered an election-winning machine but if others win then that is credited to their hard work. “The BJP is not the election-winning machine, those who say this could never understand the democracy of this country and hopes, dreams, expectations of the people of this country,” the Prime Minister said.The Prime Minister said the BJP works for the development of the nation but the opposition has used the game of secularism and communalism against the party. Incorrect narratives are constructed against the government, Modi said citing examples of the farm laws, Citizenship (Amendment) Act or CAA and labour laws.The Prime Minister urged the party workers to be aware and spread awareness among the people against this large conspiracy that the opposition is playing against the BJP to create political instability in the nation, through spreading lies and rumour-mongering. “Parties that began with help from local aspirations, became a family-based party later. These parties, who were wearing a mask of secularism, are finally being unmasked,” he said.“The BJP means defeating dynasty-based politics. It means an opportunity to able leadership. It means transparency and good governance. It means 'Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikaas, Sabka Vishwas',” the Prime Minister added. Also Read | Assembly Election 2021: Polling picks up as voting underway in 4 states, 1 UTModi during his address to the party workers also spoke about party workers who were threatened in West Bengal and Kerala. “Hundreds of activists have sacrificed for the party.

06-04-2021||India||In wake of increased attacks, govt trains 4,000 officials in cybersecurity||The ministry of electronics and information technology (MeitY) has virtually trained over 4,000 government officials in cyber safety in the last three months, in the wake of an increase in such attacks, officials familiar with the matter told Hindustan Times. The course, which started in December last, offers two variants — a one-day basic training to avoid cases of cyber breaches and digital sanitisation, and a five-day deep dive into the technical aspects of the same. Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (CDAC), Hyderabad is the implementing agency for both the training programmes. “More government officials are increasingly applying for the course,” an official said on the condition of anonymity. “We aim to try and train all government employees in the course of six months.” HT, last month, reported several instances in which government domain email addresses were used to launch cyber attacks.The discovery of critical vulnerabilities in several government servers, which could have given attackers access to sensitive networks, underscores the need for the country’s digital infrastructure to be made more secure.The training includes information security at the organisational level, cyber ethics and details of cyber offences, data, passwords and email security, mobile security, mobile app security and social engineering attacks. The initial six to eight hours, which constitute the basic training, also cover social networking security and secured financial transactions. A 1,000 participants can be trained during the webinar, according to the course document accessed by HT.

Over 500 people signed up and completed the programme that addresses cyber security basics for IT/ICT environment, information security policies, procedures and guidelines and system and network security concepts. The programme includes information security audit and assessments including various cyber security threats and incident response. This session is more focused and has 10 participants during one course. The country has seen a sharp spike in the number of cyber incidents across different sectors. As per the information reported to and tracked by Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-In), 17,560, 24,768 and 26,121 Indian websites were hacked during the year 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively, the ministry told the Rajya Sabha on March 18 in response to an unstarred question. “According to the logs analysed and made available to CERT-In, the Internet Protocol (IP) addresses of the computers from where the attacks appear to be originated belong to various countries including Algeria, Brazil, China, France, Indonesia,Netherlands, North Korea, Pakistan, Russia, Serbia, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, Tunisia, Turkey,USA, Vietnam, etc,” the ministry had said. Union minister of state for MeitY Sanjay Dhotre also told the Parliament that in the last six months, during the Covid-19 pandemic, there has been a rise in scanning and malware infections across sectors.A total of 110, 54, and 59 websites of Central ministries, departments, and state governments were hacked in 2018, 2019, and 2020, respectively, the minister said in a written reply to the Rajya Sabha.HT, on March 5 reported that cyber operations by state actors and the abuse of social media for “narrative warfare” are some of the particular threats likely to be recognised by the government in the National Cyber Security Strategy, 2021 (NCSS 2021), a policy paper that could also make it mandatory for any business or government department with a significant IT interface to set up a cyber safety cell.This will be part of a long-awaited overhaul in how India sees and approaches dangers in the digital domain. India’s current posture stems from the National Cyber Security Policy of 2013, which officials and experts say has become outdated in the face of a threat landscape that affects national security, governance and critical infrastructure, communications, and business more deeply than ever.Over the last couple of years, India has also faced several high-profile cyber attacks, including those purportedly originating in North Korea that targeted the Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant and the Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) in 2019. Earlier this week, security consultants reported finding a China-backed operation to target India’s electricity grid.Subimal Bhattacharjee, an independent consultant on defence and cyber issues, said that the online cyber security training for government employees is desirable and should be pursued with more vigour. “This is a good step by the government to sensitise basics to all employees and also have a special course of technical staff of every ministry/department,” he said. “At the same time, the employees also should be trained about they should keep their official and government online platforms separately and have well defined access control to official networks. More number of employees should be motivated to undertake these courses and keep on updating themselves after the courses periodically.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-wake-of-increased-attacks-govt-trains-4-000-officials-in-cybersecurity-101617683297609.html

Later it was merged with several parties in 1977 to form the Janata Party.In 1980, the national executive council of the Janata Party banned its members from being 'dual members' of the party and the RSS. Consequently, the former Jana Sangh members left the party and floated a new political party. Thus, the BJP came into existence on April 6, 1980.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjps-41st-foundation-day-pm-modi-to-address-party-workers-today-101617677882333.html
06-04-2021||India||Goa considers own lab to test Covid-19 strain due to long wait at Pune||The Goa government is planning to set up its own genome sequencing lab since the National Institute of Virology in Pune is taking a long time to identify variants responsible for the new Covid-19 surge, said health minister. Vishwajit Rane pointed out that results of samples sent to the NIV several weeks ago had not been returned, leaving the state clueless about the strains prevalent in the state.“We know that a lot of tourists and other people are coming into the state of Goa. There was a suggestion to track people since people even come from Brazil to Portugal and (then) indirectly into Goa. Tracking where they came from also needs to be done,” Rane said.“Many times the media asks us what strain it is. Of the 15 or so tests that we sent to the NIV, we have not got any results till today. So I was discussing that we should explore the possibility to see how we can set up genome testing facilities in Goa or if we can tie up with somebody,” Rane said.He said the dean of Goa Medical College has been asked to explore the feasibility and accordingly send a proposal to the state government for setting up such a facility in the state.“If it’s feasible and if Rupees 1.5 crore is spent to get genome testing (facility) here so that we know what type of strain we are dealing with, (then) there is no harm in exploring the possibility and workability of (establishing) such a lab in Goa. It is not just (about) purchasing the equipment, it’s also to see whether we are able to run it,” he said.“Instead of hot-mixing (resurfacing) one road, I might as well buy one machine worth ₹1.5 crore and do the genome sequencing to see what variant is spreading in the state of Goa instead of waiting 15 days (to get a result) from the NIV,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-considers-own-lab-to-test-covid-19-strain-due-to-long-wait-at-pune-lab-101617677777133.html
06-04-2021||India||Sikkim earthquake sends tremors past Bengal, Bihar, Assam; no risk of aftershocks||An earthquake measuring 5.4 magnitude hit the Sikkim-Nepal border on Monday night, the National Center for Seismology (NCS) said. Tremors were felt across eastern India, in the states of West Bengal, Assam and Bihar. Officials informed news agency PTI that there is no possibility of aftershocks--usually known to accompany earthquakes of much higher magnitudes. "Generally, aftershocks do not occur following any quake below the magnitude of six. So, in this case, there is no possibility of aftershocks," PTI quoted an NCS official as saying, when asked about the possibility of aftershocks following the earthquake.Also Read: 5.4 earthquake in Sikkim-Nepal border, tremors felt in Assam, BengalThe earthquake occurred at 8:49pm at a depth of 10km near the India-Bhutan border, PTI reported, adding that the effects were immediately felt in Sikkim's capital Gangtok and other parts of the Himalayan state. Tremors were also reported as far away as in West Bengal's Darjeeling, Jalpaiguri, Siliguri, Coochbehar, and Raiganj, as well as in Purnia and several other parts of Bihar, and Assam. The earthquake's epicentre was 25 km east-southeast (ESE) of Gangtok and it struck at a depth of 10km from the surface near the India-Bhutan border.The earthquake triggered frightened people to rush out of their residences. No loss of life or property has however been reported so far, a Sikkim government official was cited as saying.

06-04-2021||India||Bengal polls: 205 candidates will fight it out at 31 seats in third phase||In more than 20 of the 31 assembly seats that go to the polls in the third phase in West Bengal on Tuesday, the contest between the Trinamool Congress (TMC) and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) will be close because of the demographics of these constituencies and strong presence of the ruling party. The polls will be held in Hooghly, South 24 Parganas and Howrah districts. Out of the 205 candidates in the race, only 13 are women. The Election Commission of India (ECI) has deployed more than 62,000 central armed police personnel for the third phase. Like the second phase, prohibitory orders under Section 144 of Code of Criminal Procedure (Cr.PC) will be enforced around the 10,871 polling booths in the three districts on Tuesday to stop assembly of more than four people. The number of electors in the third phase is 78,52,425 of whom a little less than half are women while 243 belong to the third gender. In Hooghly district, where eight seats go to the polls, the BJP made sizeable inroads in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. Actor-turned-politician Locket Chatterjee managed to wrest the Hooghly Lok Sabha seat while the BJP lost the Arambagh seat by about a thousand votes only. Chatterjee, who is one of the four BJP Lok Sabha members contesting in the eight-phase elections, has been fielded from the Chinsurah assembly seat which is part of her Lok Sabha segment. Having promised to enforce the new citizenship law in Bengal if it comes to power, the BJP has set its eyes on the scheduled caste population, for whom the Dhaniakhali, Goghat and Arambagh seats are reserved. Arambagh is likely to witness the most fierce contest, all parties say. The TMC has fielded Sujata Mondal Khan, the estranged wife of Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BJYM) state president and Lok Sabha member Saumitra Khan from this seat. Sujata Mondal Khan joined the TMC in December after her husband sent a legal notice for divorce following a marital dispute. He announced his decision during a press conference, making the incident a first of its kind in Bengal politics. Swapan Dasgupta, the BJP’s Rajya Sabha member who resigned from the Parliament to contest the local elections, is contesting against the TMC’s Ramendu Singha at the Tarakeshwar seat in Hooghly district. “I tried to meet as many people as possible,” Dasgupta told the local media during a door-to-door campaign on Saturday. Debjit Sarkar, the former state president of the BJYM, is contesting for the Jangipara seat. “I contested the local Lok Sabha seat but the situation is quite different now. I have felt the tension in some areas,” Sarkar, who could not win in 2019, told HT on Monday night. In Hooghly district, the Communist Party of India (Marxist), or CPI(M), is contesting only the Arambagh and Tarakeshwar seats. In South 24 Parganas district, where as many as 16 assembly segments are going to the polls, several are part of the Diamond Harbour Lok Sabha constituency held by chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s nephew Abhishek Banerjee. The TMC’s youth wing president held five rallies and roadshows as campaigning came to a close at 5 pm on Sunday. The district, with 31 assembly constituencies, is a TMC stronghold. In the 2016 state polls, the ruling party won 29 seats. In 2019, when the BJP won 18 of the state’s 42 Lok Sabha seats and even made a dent in the adjacent North 24 Parganas district, voters in South 24 Parganas remained loyal to the TMC. Abhishek Banerjee won from Diamond Harbour for the second time by a margin of 3,00,000 votes. Muslims comprise a sizeable section of the population in many assembly segments such as Canning East, Baruipur East, Baruipur West and Diamond Harbour. While this may make the contest easier for the TMC, since Muslims have backed the party consistently, allegations of corruption during distribution of relief for victims of cyclone Amphan has been made the main election issue by the BJP and the Indian Secular Front founded by cleric Abbasuddin Siddiqui. Magrahat East, Bishnupur, Mandirbazar, Joynagar, Basanti, Kultali and Canning West are reserved for scheduled caste candidates. In these seats, the Left parties had a strong presence till 2016 and the Marxists are desperate to make a comeback. At Raidighi, CPI(M) stalwart and former minister Kanti Ganguly, is contesting the seat again. The CPI(M) is contesting nine seats in South 24 Parganas, including Kultali which witnessed violence in almost all elections in the past. On Monday evening, BJP and TMC workers exchanged allegations of violence at Kultali. In Howrah, where the TMC has a strong presence, only seven seats are going to the polls. Out of these, the BJP intends to put up a tough fight at Udaynarayanpur, Jagatballavpur, Uluberia North and Uluberia South although the size of the Muslim population in these zones can make things difficult for the saffron camp. Actress Tanushree Chakraborty, who joined the BJP in March, has been fielded from Shyampur. The ECI has organised the International Virtual Election Visitors Programme (IEVP) 2021 for foreign election management bodies during the elections in four states and Puducherry on Tuesday. “The ongoing elections in Assam, Kerala, Puducherry, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal have an electorate of over 187.2 million, one of the largest in the world to vote so far amid the Covid-19 pandemic. It is a good opportunity to share our best practices and experience of conduct of our poll process as well as steps taken to mitigate the effect of pandemic,” the ECI said in a statement.

How about responsibility of the CM? Uddhav Thackeray has forfeited the moral responsibility to govern,” Prasad said addressing a press conference.In the resignation letter Deshmukh posted on Twitter, he said that he doesn’t find it morally correct to continue as the home minister after the high court order against him.In March, Singh, in a letter to Thackeray alleged that Deshmukh had asked suspended cop Sachin Vaze to collect ₹100 crore per month from hotels and bars. Singh sent the letter to Thackeray after being transferred to Home Guards, a “low-key” post after mishandling of the case related to explosives being found near Mukesh Ambani’s house in Mumbai in February-end. Vaze was arrested by the National Investigation Agency in the same case and is also being probed in connection with the death of Thane businessman Mansukh Hiran whose car was found near Ambani’s residence.Prasad questioned CM’s silence on the entire issue. “When will CM Udhhav Thackeray speak? The consistent, conspicuous silence of Uddhav Thackeray is itself raising a lot of questions...,” he said.State BJP leader, Devendra Fadnavis too attacked Thackeray. “Why is the chief minister mum? His silence is unsettling.” After the HC order, Fadnavis said, “Truth will come out in the preliminary inquiry. It is improper for Deshmukh to continue as minister after the HC order...”After the HC order, Deshmukh met NCP president Sharad Pawar and expressed his desire to step down as he felt it was inappropriate to continue in office, NCP leader and state minister Nawab Malik said. “Deshmukh went to hand over the letter to Thackeray after Pawar gave his “green signal” to quit,” said Malik. Singh’s allegations are baseless but the party respects the court and hence the minister has quit, Malik said.NCP leader Dilip Walse Patil has been given the charge of the home department.With PTI inputs||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-looks-to-corner-mva-after-bombay-hc-order-on-deshmukh-101617670282666.html
06-04-2021||India||‘It’s pvt property’: SC not keen on staying INS Viraat dismantling||The Supreme Court on Monday indicated that it was not in favour of continuing the stay on the dismantling of India’s first warship, INS Viraat, and asked the petitioner seeking to convert it into a museum to respond within a week to a report submitted by a ship-breaking firm that bought it in an auction last year.The matter will be next heard on April 12.The top court stayed the dismantling of the decommissioned warship on February 10 on a plea made by a private firm, Envitech Marine Consultants, that it intended to convert the warship into a maritime museum.At an auction last July, the central government sold the warship to one Shree Ram Group of Industries, a ship-breaking firm based in Alang, Gujarat, for converting it into scrap at a price of ₹38.54 crore. The ship is currently anchored at Alang port. Subsequent to the stay order passed by the apex court, Shree Ram Group, represented by senior advocate Rajiv Dhavan, submitted on Monday that 35%-40% of the dismantling work has been completed.A three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde said on Monday: “We have same sentiments as you (Envitech Marine Consultants) have about our warships. But now it has become a private property. It cannot have the character of a warship anymore.”An inspection of the ship by Marine and Technical Surveyors on February 12 found the vessel to be a “dead structure” not capable of being in seaworthy condition or navigational position. A copy of the report supplied by Shree Ram Industries’ counsel Somanath Padhan said: “Vessel has got severe hull damage in many areas... all kinds of machineries, operational manuals removed from the vessel.”After going through the report, the bench, also comprising justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian, said, “It has been broken after a valid purchase. It is very iniquitous to continue the stay.”Envitech’s managing director, Rupali Sharma, informed the court that they were willing to call experts from abroad to conduct an inspection of the ship.The court gave a week’s time for the petitioner to go through the report presented by the ship-breaking firm and submit a response.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/its-pvt-property-sc-not-keen-on-staying-ins-viraat-dismantling-101617667358651.html

Consequently, the test positivity rate inched above 5%, the threshold that the World Health Organization identifies as ideal for an outbreak to be considered as under control.“The night curfew is being considered in wake of the resurgence of cases. The government is yet to decide on the exact time during which it will be in force and the date when it will take effect,” said a Delhi government official, asking not to be named.Across the nation, the figures reported from weekend testing was lower than that of Saturday’s, but the country has surpassed the peak seen in the first wave in September.The Union government has now decided to dispatch 50 high-level, multi-disciplinary public health teams to districts across Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh and Punjab, where the situation is particularly worrying.“The teams are being rushed to 30 districts of Maharashtra, 11 districts of Chhattisgarh and 9 districts of Punjab to assist the state health departments and local authorities in Covid-19 surveillance, control and containment measures,” the Union health ministry said in a statement on Monday.This is the biggest contingent of central experts rushed at once since the pandemic began in the country.Ahead of Modi’s meeting with CMs, Union health minister Harsh Vardhan will take a detailed review meeting on Tuesday evening (around 6pm) with of representatives of 11 states where the outbreak is particularly high, the government said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-mulls-night-curfew-pm-modi-to-meet-cms-as-wave-surges-101617666799258.html

The team was attacked when it was out on a combing operation in a forest area.Shah, who visited Chhattisgarh on Monday to review the situation and to pay tributes to those killed in the encounter, chaired a high-level meet at Jagdalpur, the headquarters of Bastar district. Chief minister Bhupesh Baghel and senior officials of the state police and the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) were present at the meeting.The home minister said that he wanted to assure people that the fight against Maoists will end in a victory. “Their (the jawans’) supreme sacrifices will not go in vain, and the country will always remember their sacrifice for taking this battle to a decisive turn. In the last few years, the fight against the Maoists has reached a decisive turn and this unfortunate incident has taken the fight two steps ahead,” Shah said.“I want to assure the country that this fight [against Maoists] will not stop... it will continue with more intensity. In this fight, our victory is definite in the end,” Shah said. The Union minister said he paid tributes to the martyred personnel on behalf of the country, the government and Prime Minister Narendra Modi.In Jagdalpur, Shah paid his last respects at the Police Lines, where the mortal remains of 14 jawans were kept in coffins draped with the national flag. Other than Shah, Baghel and senior officials also laid wreaths on the coffins.The latest Maoist attack took place between Jonaguda and Tekalguda villages along the border of Sukma and Bijapur districts in the Bastar region. Out of the 22 fatalities, CRPF lost eight men, including seven commandos of the CoBRA (CRPF’s elite unit) and one jawan of the Bastariya battalion; eight of the other deceased were from the District Reserve Guard (DRG), and six from the Special Task Force (STF).Shah also visited the Basaguda camp of CRPF in Bijapur and later met injured jawans at Raipur hospitals. Thirty-one security personnel were injured in the ambush.The home minister said that, in the review meeting, officials suggested that the intensity of the fight against Maoists should not be hampered, which reflected that the morale of the forces was intact and high.“In the last five-six years, we have achieved success in setting up camps of security forces in the interior areas. Both the central and state governments have been jointly making inroads (into Maoist strongholds). Therefore, such incidents came to the fore out of their (Maoists’) frustration,” Shah said.“On the development front, too, several works have been done. Although due to Covid-19, the pace slowed down a little, but I believe that action is being taken on all suggestions received from tribal public representatives, the Chief Minister and MPs from the state,” he added.He said the central and state governments have been working on both fronts – to expedite the development work in tribal areas and intensified action against the ultras.Prime Minister Modi has already fixed the priority to take this fight to a logical end, he said. Chief minister Baghel said more steps will follow in the future to counter Maoism in the state. “In the last few years, we have managed to establish camps in their core area and more camps will be opened soon. The development works will also be accelerated in the area,” Baghel said.After paying tribute to the security personnel, the CM said the government was with the families of the martyred jawans.Intelligence inputs showed that between 12 and 20 Maoists may have been killed in the encounter.One jawan was still missing after the attack, an official said on condition of anonymity. The security agencies were working to ascertain a claim made by Maoists that they abducted a CoBRA commando after the Saturday ambush, an official told PTI. An official said they have “reasons to believe” that this claim, made over phone on Sunday evening to a journalist based in Bijapur by a purported Maoist group, could be true, the news agency reported.He said multiple units of the security forces were still out in the jungles to look for the commando who hails from Jammu, and also to intercept the movement of the Maoists.With inputs from PTI||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/decisive-turn-in-fight-against-maoists-amit-shah-101617666422223.html

06-04-2021||India||‘Russia closely watching LAC developments’: Foreign minister Sergey Lavrov||India should “undoubtedly” be part of international efforts to find a settlement to the situation in Afghanistan as it is an “important player” in such endeavours, Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov has said.In an interview ahead of his talks with external affairs minister S Jaishankar in New Delhi on Tuesday, Lavrov also said Russia expects India and china to find “mutually acceptable political and diplomatic ways” to remove their differences at the earliest.Lavrov also outlined Russia’s priorities for engagements with India during the year, including the annual summit to be held in India and other engagements.With India and Russia set to resume high-level engagements after the Covid-19 crisis, what will be the priorities for bilateral agenda in 2021?Russia is satisfied with the vigorous political dialogue with India on all levels that keeps on actively developing despite serious restrictions caused by the Coronavirus pandemic. In 2020, we managed to successfully organise several events in face-to-face and online formats. Summits of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) and Brazil-Russia-India-China-South Africa (Brics) – a new type of multilateral associations where our countries cooperate fruitfully – are among them.This year, New Delhi holds Brics chairmanship – we wish our Indian friends every success and are willing to contribute in every possible way in this regard. India has also joined the activities of the UN Security Council as its non-permanent member. We intend to continue close interaction within the mentioned forums as well as other international platforms.We hope that the epidemiological situation would allow us to organise a bilateral summit in 2021. The dates of next sessions of the Inter-Governmental Commission on Trade, Economic, Scientific, Technical and Cultural Cooperation, Inter-Governmental Commission on Military and Military and Technical Cooperation and Inter-Parliamentary Commission are under consideration.Given the need to overcome negative consequences of the pandemic for the world and national economies, our definite priorities include intensification of the Russian-Indian practical cooperation in areas such as trade, energy, agriculture, transport, finance and banking, science and technology, humanitarian ties.I am convinced that the negotiations with my colleague Dr Subramaniam Jaishankar during my visit to New Delhi will promote further strengthening of the Special and Privileged Strategic Partnership that unites us.During your recent visit to China, did you come away with any fresh insights from your interactions with the Chinese leadership regarding India-China relations? How does Russia currently see its relations with India and China, especially in view of Moscow’s efforts to help reduce tensions related to the border standoff in Ladakh?We are closely watching the process of normalisation at the Line of Actual Control (LAC), functioning as the India-China border. We welcome the agreements reached after the telephone conversation between the foreign ministers of India and China on February 25, 2021, aimed at resolution of the situation.We highly appreciate the constructive approach demonstrated by both sides. We pay due respect to the intentions of New Delhi and Beijing to act independently and within the frameworks of established multilayer bilateral dialogue mechanisms, without interference from outside. We expect both states as responsible members of the international community to find mutually acceptable political and diplomatic ways to remove existing differences at the earliest.Russia has acknowledged India’s interests in Afghanistan and in efforts to find a solution to the situation in Afghanistan. However, India was not part of the recent “extended Troika” meeting in Moscow, and some even speculated this was done at the behest of Pakistan. What role does Russia see for India in efforts to find a settlement in Afghanistan?India is an important player in the settlement in Afghanistan and undoubtedly should be engaged in international efforts supporting the Afghan national reconciliation.New Delhi is not a participant of the extended “Troika” on Afghanistan, in the framework of which Moscow hosted intra-Afghan consultations on March 18 aimed at facilitation of the launch of peace process in the country. At the same time India is part of the Moscow format uniting the neighbouring states of Afghanistan, key regional countries and the USA. Such a composition allows to coordinate the assistance to national reconciliation process based on broad regional consensus. As the Afghan peace process moves forward, we are planning to resume the work of this mechanism.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/russia-closely-watching-lac-developments-foreign-minister-sergey-lavrov-101617658788073.html

Naik, a sweeper working with the hospital for last 30 years, was the first recipient of Covid vaccine in the state, and expectedly, the media and the government made a fuss around him.Beyond the glare of TV cameras, an early milestone in the drive was when renowned doctor and medicine specialist, Chinmay Bijay Kumar Mohanty, 65, who is now serving as Odisha’s director of medical education and training, walked into the vaccination room at the hospital, and said he wanted to volunteer as an early recipient.He lifted the left arm of his half-sleeved shirt, and a nurse administered the Covaxin shot.“There was no pain whatsoever, much lesser than what one would experience after getting a shot of Tetanus toxoid. When there is no particular medicine available for Covid, vaccination is necessary,” said Mohanty.Click here for complete coverage on Covid-19“When I took the shot, an additional director who accompanied me looked scared. But he took the shot soon after my turn, perhaps thinking if a 65-year-old man can take it, anyone can. Almost all my friends have taken the shot after my prodding -- not even a single close friend is left so far. They know that, being a doctor, I have not been carried away by the publicity surrounding the vaccine. If we compared the side effects of vaccines for Measles, Diptheria, Rabies, Mumps, Tetanus and Influenza with Covid, it is much safer,” he said.Several other doctors, including the director of Capital Hospital, Dr Laxmidhar Sahu, neurosurgeon Dr Ashok Mohapatra, and director of AIIMS-Bhubaneswar, Dr Gitanajali Batmanbane, also took the shot on the first day. A little over 16,000 health care workers in the state were vaccinated on January 16.Mohanty said he never had any doubts about the need to get the shot, even though he had already been infected with Covid-19. “In my 40-year-old medical career, I was never hospitalised. But in October last year, I got Covid, and spent 10 days in ICU. Being a doctor, I know the benefits of a vaccine. I am have mild diabetes and cholesterol. So I was waiting for it; I consider myself lucky that I was among the first doctors to take it on Day 1. I had no reaction whatsoever,” he said.Also Read | What science tells us about Covid-19 vaccinesMohanty’s sister-in-law, nephew and younger brother, too, were infected with Covid-19, and have now been vaccinated.After taking the vaccine, Mohanty started inspiring others to take the jab as soon as they became eligible, without delay.“People are always scared of a new thing. But people should trust doctors. We are living in a world where there will always be microorganisms. We have to survive among them, and fight with the harmful ones. A vaccine is our best hope of fighting such pathogens and we should fight with a positive hope,” he said.A common question people ask, Mohanty says, is which shot is better, Covaxin or Covishield. Mohanty’s standard reply is that both the vaccines work well, and one should take either shot without any hesitancy — regardless of whether one was infected with Covid-19 in the past or not.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vaccine-is-our-best-hope-doc-leads-the-way-in-battle-against-hesitancy-101617657011304.html

According to the ED, the attached assets include land, factory premises, machinery and other properties belonging to two companies -- M/s Ispat Damodar Private Limited and M/s Sonic Thermal Private Limited. “Investigation revealed that Majee had transferred funds worth ₹67.80 crore to these companies under the guise of share purchase of these companies required to acquire assets of these companies. The manufacturing plants of both these companies are situated in West Bengal’s Purulia and Bankura. Majee later transferred funds worth ₹98.06 crore to both these companies,” read the ED statement. “The investigation also found that the transfer of funds to these companies were generated through illegal coal mining and the transactions were layered through a maze of shell companies,” it added. The Enforcement Directorate took up the investigation based on an FIR registered by the Central Bureau of Investigation last year. The agency recently arrested Vikas Mishra, the brother of Trinamool Congress leader Vinay Mishra, and Bankura inspector Ashok Mishra in connection with the same case. Several people associated with the Trinamool Congress (TMC) leaders, including party MP Abhishek Banerjee’s wife Rujira Banerjee and his in-laws, are under the scanner of central agencies with connection to the coal scam.

The Bahujan Samaj Party legislator from Mau will be lodged in Banda jail where the CCTVs were being installed and repaired.“Mukhtar Ansari is currently lodged in Ropar jail in Punjab. The Uttar Pradesh government approached the Supreme Court, which ordered the transfer of Ansari from Punjab to UP. In line with Supreme Court’s order, Ansari will be brought to his home state in tight security and will be lodged in a jail here,” said Prashant Kumar, additional director general of police (ADG) law and order, Uttar Pradesh.Ansari faces trial in several cases in the state, officials said.IG Chitrakoot range K Satyanarayana, who sent the team on Monday morning, said the shifting will take place amid tight security arrangements.ADG Kumar said, “Recently in Barabanki, he has been named in a case. Ansari committed heinous crimes in Purvanchal in the past, including the killing of police personnel.”Punjab’s home department in a letter had asked the Uttar Pradesh government to take custody of Ansari from the Ropar jail on or before April 8.It had written to the Uttar Pradesh additional chief secretary (home) following a March 26 Supreme Court order that directed the Punjab government to transfer Ansari to UP’s Banda jail in two weeks from the Ropar prison, where he has been since January 2019 in connection with an extortion case.Acting superintendent of the Banda district jail Pramod Tiwari said all arrangements have been made in Barrack Number-15 to lodge Ansari. “No other prisoner can reach this barrack,” said Tiwari.“Three prison guards will be deployed inside the barrack,” he added.In the letter, the Punjab home department had asked the Uttar Pradesh additional chief secretary (Home) for suitable arrangements to be made for Ansari’s transfer.It also said that Ansari suffered from certain medical conditions and the same may be kept in mind while making arrangements for his transfer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/100-armed-cops-leave-for-punjab-to-bring-ansari-back-to-up-jail-101617648976391.html
06-04-2021||India||SC raps CBI over delay in filing appeal in graft case||The Supreme Court on Monday questioned the Central Bureau of Investigation’s “competence” as a “premier investigating agency” while reproaching it over delay in filing an appeal against acquittal of a government employee in a corruption case.“Why is CBI so incompetent when it considers itself to be the premier investigating agency?” a bench headed by Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul asked additional solicitor general RS Suri, who appeared for the central agency.The bench, which also included Justice Hemant Gupta, observed that it was amusing to come across the delay of almost a year in filing the appeal in a case that was now being pitched as a “very important” matter.Suri said that the problems were being addressed in the agency and some “reshaping” was also being done.The bench, however, replied: “This so-called reshaping has been happening for quite some time but to us, it does not seem to be happening at all.”Justice Kaul asked the ASG whether any action has been taken against the officers responsible for causing delay of 314 days in filing the appeal against the order of acquittal by the Delhi high court in May, 2019. “And if you have done nothing about the delay, why should we not dismiss it? We cannot let you walk in whenever you want,” the judge added.Suri responded by saying that dismissal of the appeal on the ground of delay would result in letting two criminals go scot free even though they stood convicted by the trial court. He added that the agency was willing to abide by any order of the court in this regard.“If that be the position, first it is the CBI which has to show some seriousness in the matter of fixing responsibility on the persons responsible for the inordinate delay of 314 days in filing the special leave petition,” stated the court in its order.The bench told the ASG that it would consider admitting the CBI’s appeal only after they conduct an inquiry and fasten accountability on those responsible for the delay.It noted in its order: “There is delay of 314 days for which no satisfactory explanation has been forthcoming. We are dealing with a premier investigating agency, the CBI!…We thus direct the CBI to hold an enquiry; fix the responsibility and place that before us, before requesting us to issue notice.”The court gave CBI two months to complete its inquiry and place a report before it.The case relates to an alleged complicity between CB Singh, who was posted as junior engineer in the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) between 2000 and 2001, and co-accused Rajvir Singh, a private builder who constructed flats without any approved sanctioned plan.The investigation was entrusted to the CBI by an order of the Delhi high court in 2006, following which the duo was booked and charge sheeted. A trial court in Delhi held them guilty of corruption and criminal conspiracy and sentenced them to three years each in jail in March 2016. But the Delhi high court reversed this decision in 2019 and set them free, prompting the CBI to file an appeal in the top court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-raps-cbi-over-delay-in-filing-appeal-in-graft-case-101617648975070.html

The Congress can confront the divisive forces who are damaging and destroying all that India has stood for and represented for twenty centuries and more,” Gandhi said in a statement. Kerala goes to the polls on April 6.Gandhi has not participated in the Congress’s campaign for the ongoing elections due to the prevailing Covid-19 situation.In her appeal to the voters, Gandhi also said a vote for the UDF is “a vote for the future of Kerala” and for “preserving its democratic traditions and its secular values”, adding that the Congress-led alliance will bring Kerala back on the path of development and ensure a “decent, guaranteed monthly income to all families but particularly to the poor and the disadvantaged, to the scheduled castes and scheduled tribes, to fishermen and women, to widows and the aged”.The Kerala election is crucial for the Congress as a victory could consolidate Rahul Gandhi’s grip over the party that has suffered frictions between the old guard and the young leaders over the functioning of the party.The Congress chief also spoke about the NYAY scheme — the assured income scheme that was pegged as the main plank of the party in its 2019 campaign — saying: “The Congress will make the “NYAY SCHEME” the edifice of the next UDF government. This will ensure a guaranteed monthly income for each family in the state, particularly for families belonging to the poor and disadvantaged sections.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sonia-appeals-to-kerala-voters-to-bring-udf-govt-strengthen-the-cong-nationally-101617648857567.html

The exercise comes at a time when China is making concerted efforts to strengthen its presence in IOR. Two Indian warships and a long-range maritime patrol aircraft are taking part in the French Navy-led exercise called La Pérouse for the first time.“Participation by the Indian Navy in the exercise demonstrates the shared values with friendly navies ensuring freedom of seas and commitment to an open, inclusive Indo-Pacific and a rules-based international order,” Commander Vivek Madhwal said.India, the US, Japan and Australia constitute the Quadrilateral security dialogue or Quad. China has been wary of the Quad that was revived in late 2017. And Beijing’s suspicions have increased since the four countries upgraded the forum to the ministerial level in 2019.Indian warships INS Satpura (with an embarked helicopter) and INS Kiltan, and a Boeing P-8I submarine hunter aircraft are taking part in the three-day exercise being held from April 5 to April 7.France is represented at the multi-lateral exercise by amphibious assault ship Tonnerre and frigate Surcouf; the US Navy has sent its amphibious transport dock USS Somerset for the drills; Australia has deployed its frigate HMAS Anzac and tanker Sirius; and Japan has sent Akebono, a destroyer, for the drills.“Exercise La Pérouse will witness complex and advanced naval operations including surface warfare, anti-air warfare and air defence exercises, weapons-firing exercises, cross-deck flying operations, tactical manoeuvres and seamanship evolutions such as replenishment at sea,” Madhwal added.Last November, navy chief Admiral Karambir Singh said a “great power competition” was playing out vigorously in IOR, where the navy has stepped up surveillance to check China’s ambitions.“IOR is one of the most militarised regions… Also, there are differing interpretations of international laws and there is this fear that ‘Global Commons’ can change to ‘Contested Seas’, threatening free flow of commerce and trade,” the navy chief then said.Former navy chief Admiral Arun Prakash (retd) described the French Navy-led drills, involving the participation of the Quad navies, as a positive development, and a message to China.He said, “So far, naval cooperation in IOR has been limited to the Quad. The presence of France is an expression of intent of other European powers to be there in IOR and send a message to China. Other countries like the United Kingdom are also deploying to the region for drills.”From carrying out naval drills with like-minded countries to reaching out to states in IOR, the Indian Navy is focusing on checking China’s rising ambitions in the region and sending out a strong message that Beijing’s power play in South China Sea cannot be replicated in the Indian Ocean.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/quad-navies-join-france-led-drills-in-indian-ocean-region-101617648856955.html
06-04-2021||India||Rafale deal: Cong, BJP trade barbs as report says €1 mn paid to ‘middleman’||A report in Mediapart, a French online journal, late on Sunday claimed that Dassault Aviation, which manufactures the Rafale jet, paid €1 million to a Sushen Gupta, described as a “middleman”, in connection with the ₹59,000 crore deal for 36 jets for the Indian Air Force.The Congress demanded an independent investigation into the matter even as law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad termed the report “baseless”. Gupta, whose name figures in the Agusta Westland charge sheet, did not respond to queries seeking comment.Mediapart claimed that the money was paid for the manufacture of 50 large replica models of Rafale jets, even though Dassault provided inspectors of French anti-corruption agency Agence Française Anticorruption (AFA) with no proof that these models were made. The reporter who wrote the article, Yann Philippin said he found it very “suspicious” that the discovery was “covered up by AFA, which did not report it to French prosecutors”.A spokesperson for Dassault Aviation did not respond to a HT query on the Mediapart report.The report is the latest controversy to dog the deal, and Philippin said it was the first of three parts with the second part focusing on the way the French justice system dealt with initial “suspicions” that rose in 2018, and the third , “on the deal itself and what happened behind the scenes”.India ordered the jets in September 2016 as an emergency purchase through a government-to-government deal.The Mediapart report said AFA inspectors were surprised when they came across a “suspect payment” of €508,925 listed against the head “gifts to clients”.“Mediapart understands that during a scheduled audit of the group, the agency’s inspectors found that Dassault had agreed to pay €1 million to a middleman just after the 2016 signing of the Rafale fighter jet deal. That middleman is now accused of money laundering in India in another defence deal,” the report said.According to Mediapart, AFA decided not to refer the matter to French prosecutors even though a subsequent confidential report of the agency found that the amount of €508,925 “seemed disproportionate in relation to all the other entries” under the same heading.“The sum is indeed huge for a gift. Though French law does not set out precise limits, legal precedents suggest that giving a watch or an expensive meal costing several hundred euros can be enough to constitute corruption,” the Mediapart report said.It said to justify the “gift”, Dassault supplied the AFA with a “proforma invoice” of March 30, 2017, which was given by an Indian company called Defsys Solutions. “This invoice, which related to 50% of the total order (€1,017,850), was for the manufacture of 50 models of the Rafale C, with a price per unit of €20,357,” Mediapart said, quoting the AFA report.According to the French report, AFA questioned Dassault, but the jet-makers have not been able to answer the queries.The Mediapart report claimed that Defsys belongs to the Gupta family, whose members have acted as middlemen in the aeronautical and defence industries for three generations. It said two Indian media reports from January 2019 revealed that one family member, Sushen Gupta, who operated as an agent for Dassault, worked on the Rafale contract and allegedly obtained confidential documents from India’s Ministry of Defence. Gupta was investigated by Indian agencies over his role in the AgustaWestland VVIP chopper scam.ED and the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) are probing allegations of money laundering in the 2007 contract for the purchase of 12 luxury VIP helicopters for use by top political leaders, including the President, the Prime Minister, and former PMs. The deal was cancelled in early 2014 over allegations of wrongdoing. Among the people named in the charge sheets filed by ED is Ratul Puri, the nephew of former Madhya Pradesh chief minister and senior Congress leader Kamal Nath.Referring to the Mediapart article, Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said: “Was the payment of €1.1 million shown by Dassault as ‘gifts to clients’ in reality a commission paid to middleman for the Rafale Deal? How can ‘middleman’ and ‘payment of commission’ be permitted in a ‘government to government defence contract’ or in any defence procurement in India in violation of the mandatory defence procurement procedure?”Arguing that the latest media report vitiated the Rafale deal, Surjewala said the revelation entailed imposition of heavy financial penalties on Dassault, banning of the company, registration of an FIR and other penal consequences.“Does it now not require a full and independent investigation into India’s biggest defence deal to find out as to how much bribery and commission in reality, if any, was paid and to whom in the Indian government?” the Congress said, asking if Prime Minister Narendra Modi would answer to the nation on this.After the report was released, Union minister of law and justice Ravi Shankar Prasad called it baseless and said, “It’s completely baseless. The Supreme Court, CAG found nothing wrong [in the deal].”This is not Mediapart’s first article on the deal.In October 2018, it raised questions about the offset contract that was part of the Rafale deal. It said a senior official in Dassault Aviation saw the partnership with Anil Ambani’s Reliance Group as “imperative and mandatory” to getting the “export contract” with India for the Rafale aircraft.After the latest article, the Congress has demanded that the standard procedure—lodging an FIR, independent investigation and related moves—must follow and reminded the government that during the UPA rule, then defence minister AK Antony had followed the stipulated procedure in the case of AgustaWestland.The Opposition party said that defence procurement has an “integrity clause” that says there can be no middleman or payment of commission or bribe.Union minister Prasad said, “Is Congress again talking about Rafale? It lost case in Supreme Court. The CAG has also rejected the charges. In 2019 polls they displayed Rafale models everywhere and said so much against the PM. Yet, the lost the polls.”“I had once said that Rahul Gandhi doesn’t do his homework. It now looks like the Congress spokespersons also don’t do it. As you all know corporate rivalry goes on in France. But the most interesting thing is that the article mentions Sushen Gupta. Who is Gupta? He was arrested over Agusta Westland in 2019 by our government. And the name of (Gandhi) family members came up in Agusta Westland case. And (former foreign minister) Salman Khurshid has publicly acknowledged that he knows Gupta’s family. So, I want to tell the Congress to do proper homework before you speak,” said Prasad.The National Democratic Alliance’s (NDA) decision to enter a $8.7 billion government-to-government deal with France to buy 36 Rafale warplanes made by Dassault was announced in April 2015, with an agreement signed a little over a year later. This replaced the previous United Progressive Alliance (UPA) regime’s decision to buy 126 Rafale aircraft, 108 of which were to be made in India by the state-owned Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd (HAL).The deal became controversial, with the Opposition, led by the Congress, claiming that the price at which India is buying Rafale aircraft now is ₹1,670 crore for each, three times the initial bid of ₹526 crore by the company when the UPA was trying to buy the aircraft. It has also claimed the previous deal included a technology transfer agreement with HAL.The Supreme Court heard a publc interest case on the deal and in November 2019, said it saw nothing wrong in it. In a February 2019 report, the government’s auditor, the Comptroller and Auditor General of India audited the deal and said India had not overpaid for the jets.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rafale-deal-cong-bjp-trade-barbs-as-report-says-1-mn-paid-to-middleman-101617648734959.html

The duo are admitted to a hospital in Raipur, he added.“This is exemplary. He also sustained bullet injuries and kept fighting during the ambush. Both the Sikh jawan and his colleague are safe and recuperating in a hospital,” he said.Speaking to reporters here, Singh said: “Heavy firing was going on from the two sides and suddenly, I saw Dubey sustained injuries on his leg and was bleeding excessively. I took off my turban and tied it around his wound just to stop the bleeding. Later, I also sustained bullet injuries.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maoist-attack-sikh-jawan-uses-turban-to-help-injured-colleague-101617648676924.html
06-04-2021||India||India records third warmest March in 121 yrs: IMD||The month of March this year was the third warmest in 121 years, after 2004 and 2010, with an average maximum temperature of 32.6 degree C, 1.4 degree C above normal, the India Meteorological Department said on Monday.The monthly average maximum, minimum and mean temperature in March this year was 32.65 degree C, 19.95 degree C and 26.30 degree C respectively, against the normal of 31.24 degree C, 18.87 degree C and 25.06 degree C based on the climatology for 1981 to 2010 period, the IMD said. The temperatures were above normal in all subdivisions of northwest, central, eastern and north-eastern India but in parts of peninsular India they were below normal, the weather department added. In 2004, the average maximum temperature for March was 32.82 degree C and in 2010 it was 33.09 degree C.Heat wave conditions were recorded in many parts of the country in March with severe heat wave at isolated places occurred over West Rajasthan during March 29 to 31. Heat wave conditions were recorded over east Rajasthan during March 30 to 31, over Odisha and adjoining parts of Gangetic west Bengal, Coastal Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu on March 31. The highest maximum temperature of 44.6 degree C was recorded at Baripada, Odisha on March 30.The months of January and February were also the third warmest since 1901 when mean temperatures are considered and the second warmest in the past 120 years when minimum or early morning temperatures are considered, the IMD said in its earlier report. Through January, February and March, La Nina, a global meteorological phenomenon was prevailing which is associated with colder winters and generally milder temperatures. But this year’s warming trend has possibly overshadowed the cooling effect of La Nina.“One of the main reasons for record high temperatures being recorded since January is scanty rains. When there is less rain air is dry and warm,” said M Mohapatra, director general, IMD.“It’s difficult to say why temperatures are so high despite La Nina conditions being moderate. La Nina has started weakening now. It is (the impact of) climate change signature on temperature patterns. You can see that temperatures in the south peninsula didn’t rise as much because of clouding and rain,” OP Sreejith, scientist, climate monitoring and prediction group had said in March about warmer than usual winter.For April, IMD has forecast high probability of above normal maximum temperatures over most subdivisions of northwest, north along the plains of Himalayas, east, west and central India and below normal maximum temperatures over most subdivisions of south Peninsular India, northeast India and few subdivisions of extreme north India.Western disturbance (WD) activity in March was higher than normal as a total of 7 WDs moved across Western Himalayan Region against the normal of four WDs. Out of 7 WDs, 3 WDs were very active and had moved as a cyclonic circulation but rainfall over the country as a whole for March was 16.7 mm, which is 45% less than its Long Period Average (LPA) of 30.4 mm. Week by week rainfall data in March 2021 shows that consecutively past four weeks in the season, India recorded deficient rainfall over the entire country.All three active WDs, however, caused scattered to fairly widespread rainfall and thunderstorm activity over Western Himalayan region during the period and movement of these systems to eastward and formation of its induced cyclonic circulation over northwest Rajasthan in association with these WDs, caused isolated to scattered rainfall/thunderstorm activity over adjoining plains of northwest India during the same period. Dust raising strong surface winds prevailed during March 30 to 31 over parts of Punjab, Rajasthan, Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh.In March, moderate La Niña conditions were prevailing over equatorial Pacific and Sea Surface Temperatures (SSTs) were below normal over central & eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean. El Niño and the Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is a periodic fluctuation in sea surface temperature and the air pressure of the overlying atmosphere across the equatorial Pacific Ocean according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).ENSO has a major influence on weather and climate patterns such as heavy rains, floods and drought. El Niño has a warming influence on global temperatures, whilst La Niña has the opposite effect. In India for example, El Nino is associated with drought or weak monsoon while La Nina is associated with strong monsoon and above average rains and colder winters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-records-3rd-warmest-march-in-121-yrs-imd-101617648676287.html
06-04-2021||India||Maoist attack: Search on for missing jawan, cops do not rule out abduction||A jawan missing after a Maoist ambush over the weekend in Chhattisgarh’s Bastar region may have been abducted by the ultras, senior officials said on Monday, even as they were trying to verify the intel amid a search operation by security forces in the jungles where 22 personnel were killed in a gunfight.Out of the 22 deaths, the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) lost eight men, including seven commandos of CoBRA (CRPF’s elite unit) and one jawan of the Bastariya battalion; eight of the other deceased were from the District Reserve Guard (DRG) and six from the Special Task Force (STF). One CoBRA jawan has remained missing since the attack.Inspector general of police, Bastar Range, Sunderaj P said the state police were committed to bringing the commando back if the reports of him being abducted were confirmed. “After the Jonaguda-Tekalgurem operations on Saturday, whereabouts of one CoBRA jawan couldn’t be ascertained. Efforts are on to trace his location and bring him back safely. We have taken cognisance of the information that the missing CoBRA jawan has been abducted by Maoists. We are committed to bring back the jawan safely. Security forces are equally committed for peace and development of Bastar region,” he said.A top officer in the security establishment told PTI that they have “reasons to believe” the abduction claim made over phone on Sunday evening to a journalist based in Bijapur by a purported Maoist group was true. “However, we do not have concrete evidence to substantiate the claim made by some Maoist elements that he [the jawan] has been taken away by them,” the officer added.Meanwhile, the family members of the jawan, who belongs to Lower Barnai region of the Jammu district, have appealed to his abductors to release him.“I spoke to my husband on Friday at around 9.30pm and he told me that he is packing his bag and food for an operation and will talk to me the next day. Following the attack [on Saturday], a local reporter from Chhattisgarh called me and asked whether I want to say something to the Maoists because he informed me that he will take our appeal to them. I told him that I want to request them [Maoists] to release him,” said the jawan’s wife.She said that she has not been provided any information from the officials. “The CRPF Group Centre at Bantalab has not informed us anything about his whereabouts. All of us are very worried,” she said.The CoBRA jawan joined the CRPF in March 2011. He was transferred to Chhattisgarh three months ago. He was earlier posted in Assam.CRPF’s Jammu sector spokesperson and deputy commandant Shivnandan Singh said: “The jawan remains missing. We are getting reports from the media that he is probably with Maoists. The search operations are on to trace him.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maoist-attack-search-on-for-missing-jawan-cops-do-not-rule-out-abduction-101617648675573.html
06-04-2021||India||PM Modi to hold meet with CMs as infections rise||Prime Minister Narendra Modi will hold an emergency meeting with chief ministers of all states on Thursday in the wake of the surge in coronavirus cases in most parts of the country.The upcoming virtual meeting comes just three weeks after his interaction – of the shortest interval – with the chief ministers on March 17 to discuss the progress in vaccination and measures to tackle the second wave in some parts of the country.While the country registered 35,871 fresh cases on March 17, it breached the one-lakh mark for the first time with 103,558 cases on Sunday. The overall tally stood at 12,589,067 on Monday, according to the Union health ministry.In the upcoming meeting, the Prime Minister is expected to emphasise the strict enforcement of Covid-19 protocols and check the fatigue that has set in after a year’s tackling of the pandemic, an official who is familiar with the development said, preferring anonymity. A presentation is likely to be made on the rapid surge in cases and the trend of the latest outbreak, the official added.Click here for complete Covid-19 coverageFollowing the March 17 meeting, the vaccination programme was widened to cover citizens above the age of 45. The inoculation of this latest priority group began on April 1.Modi and the chief ministers are also likely to discuss how to hasten the vaccination drive, on Thursday, the official cited above said.On Sunday, the Prime Minister held an internal review on the Covid situation.A meeting between cabinet secretary Rajiv Gauba and officials of 11 “states of grave concern” were also held last Friday. During this interaction, the states were given a 19-point action plan that included increased Covid testing to bring down the positivity rate to 5 per cent or less, conducting 70 per cent of the tests using RT-PCR method and creation of more containment zones.In the same meeting, Union home secretary Ajay Bhalla had expressed anguish over the situation and observed that even amid the spike in cases, none of the states and Union territories had shown “commensurate increase in enforcement of containment activities. Dr V K Paul, member of NITI Aayog, emphasised that states follow a protocol for sharing clinical and epidemiological data for a detailed of the mutant strains of the virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-to-hold-meet-with-cms-as-infections-rise-101617648674987.html
06-04-2021||India||C’garh Maoist attack a retaliation to increased presence of forces: Officials||The actions of the security forces who have opened 24 new ‘permanent camps’ in the Naxal hotbed of Bastar-Sukma region in the last four years, bringing approximately 600 square kilometres of area inside the deep forest under control, is what perhaps ‘irked’ the Maoist and Saturday’s attack was a sign of their desperation, people familiar with the development said.Twenty-two police and paramilitary personnel were killed and at least two dozen others injured in a gunfight with Maoists in Bastar region as the extremists ambushed the forces after possibly luring them to an area near the Bijapur-Sukma border on Saturday. One jawan was missing after the attack.The 1,200 square km long Bastar-Sukma belt in Chhattisgarh is considered to be the stronghold of the current Maoist movement in the country.Also Read | Chhattisgarh Maoist attack: How a Sikh jawan, hit with bullets, took off his turban to bandage colleague’s woundsWhile four camps of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) were opened in Bijapur and Sukma in February 2021 alone, six others were set up in 2017, nine in 2018, one in 2019 and four in 2020. The areas where these new camps were operationalised include Galgam, Elarmagdu, Minapa, Mukram Nala, Bhadrimau, Punjer Nala, Pushpal, Vishrampuri, Netanar, Koleng Nala, Mugapadar, Palodi, Pamed and Tarrem among others, and are now under the control of the forces in Chhattisgarh.Having a permanent base inside the forest – each camp has a strength of a company of around 100 personnel – allowed the CRPF, Chhattisgarh Police and specialized units to reduce travel time after operations and area domination exercises, one of the officers cited above said, preferring anonymity.Besides the Bastar-Sukma belt, dozens of new “permanent camps” were set up in other Maoist hotbeds, including the 2,000 sq km AOB (Andhra-Odisha border) area, 4,500 sq km Abujmaad forest area and Jharkhand in the last four years, due to which the Maoists are ‘irked’, another officer said on the condition of anonymity.“Having a permanent camp not only gives an edge as Maoists cannot ambush these easily because they are fully equipped and back-up is always (available) nearby, but they are key to civic authorities taking development work to the remote villages so that the government’s benefits can reach the last person. Maoists do not want development work to take place and let people live in isolation,” K Durga Prasad, former director general of CRPF, said.Also Read | Drone shows tractor trolleys used to carry up to 20 dead Maoists: OfficialsExperts on anti-Naxal operations believe the camps are not the sole reasons why the ‘red ultras’ are peeved but due to several factors, including a string of coordinated operations in the last four to five years, better intelligence sharing between agencies, disruption of their logistics chains like weapons, money and food items, a leadership crisis as well as massive crackdown on alleged ‘urban naxals’ that have played a role in waning their influence.The number of districts from where Maoists’ violence is reported now range from 50 to 54 only, as compared to over 100 districts until a few years back. An internal study by CRPF ‘Countering Maoism – Way Ahead’, reviewed by HT, said that the ‘surrender of many senior Maoist leaders such as Tech Ramanna and Pahad Singh has affected the morale of the Maoists negatively’.It added that the shrinking of the security vacuum areas is being witnessed, particularly in south Sukma where the forces have achieved a deeper penetration with longer stay in the zone without any contact with Maoists.According to government data, there has been a 70 per cent decline in Maoist-related violence in the country – from 2,258 incidents in 2009 to 665 in 2020.Prime Minister Narendra Modi, during the annual Director Generals/Inspector Generals (DGs/IGs) conference of Intelligence Bureau 2019, had asked agencies to monitor the internet-related activities of urban naxals as well as collect data of their trips abroad.Last year, the National Investigation Agency chargesheeted several Left-leaning activists and academicians, including Shoma Sen, Surendra Gadling, Sudhir Dhawale, Rona Wilson, Arun Ferreira, Vernon Gonsalves, Sudha Bhardwaj and Varavara Rao for their alleged links with Maoists.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cgarh-maoist-attack-a-retaliation-to-increased-presence-of-forces-officials-101617648615741.html
06-04-2021||India||Sputnik maker ties up with Indian firm to produce 100 mn doses||The makers of Russian Covid-19 vaccine, Sputnik V, have tied up with another Indian vaccine manufacturer, Panacea Biotec, to produce 100 million doses of their Covid-19 vaccine. The vaccine has shown an efficacy of 91.6%.“Vaccine partnerships are the only way to overcome the pandemic. The world continues its fight against coronavirus and we see a growing interest in Sputnik V vaccine as it is one of the best vaccines available. Cooperation with Panacea Biotec is an important step to produce the vaccine in India and to supply our international partners around the world,” said Kirill Dmitriev, chief executive officer, RDIF.Production of Sputnik V at Panacea Biotec sites will help facilitate global supply of Sputnik V to international partners of Russian Development Investment Fund (RDIF), Russia’s sovereign wealth fund, RDIF said in a statement.Till date, Sputnik V has been registered in 59 countries. In India, RDIF has already tied up with fivelocal companies-- Dr Reddy’s, Hetero Biopharma, Gland Pharma, Stelis Biopharma and Virchow Biotech-- for Sputnik V.“We are pleased to collaborate with RDIF to produce Sputnik V for global markets. Panacea Biotec brings decades of vaccine manufacturing and distribution know-how to scale-up Sputnik V supplies. Panacea Biotec will produce Sputnik V in its internationally accredited facilities complying to strict GMP standards and prequalified by WHO,” said Rajesh Jain, managing director, Panacea Biotec.Sputnik V developed by the Gamaleya National Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology was registered by the Ministry of Health of Russia and became the world’s first registered vaccine against Covid-19 based on the established human adenoviral vector platform.In September 2020, Dr Reddy’s and RDIF entered a partnership to conduct the clinical trials of the Sputnik V vaccine and the rights for distribution in India. In February this year, Dr Reddy’s applied to India’s drugs regulator for emergency use authorization of Sputnik V in the country. The application is still pending with the drugs controller, as the subject expert committee has sought more data from the clinical trials.Once approved, Sputnik V will be the third vaccine that will be used in India’s Covid-19 immunisation programme that was launched on January 16, this year.Meanwhile, Zydus Cadila on Monday also announced that it has sought national drugs controller’s approval for use of its viral hepatitis drug in treating Covid-19 patients as its phase 3 clinical trials with the drug showed promising results.According to the company, 91.15% of patients treated with Pegylated Interferon Alpha 2b, PegiHepTM were reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT PCR) negative by day 7 as compared to 78.90% on the standard of care arm in its phase 3 trials. Also, the drug reduced the duration for supplemental oxygen to 56 hours from 84 hours in moderate Covid-19 patients.“…the interim results indicate that PegIFN, when administered early on, could help patients recover faster avoiding much of the complications seen in the advanced stages of the disease. PegIFN in COVID19 has several add-on advantages compared to other anti-viral agents. The treatment regimen would be less cumbersome and more affordable for patients as Pegylated Interferon Alpha 2b, is a single dose regimen. It would also ensure better compliance,” said the company in a statement.The drug— PegIFN— has well-established safety with multiple doses in chronic hepatitis B and C patients over the years.Aging reduces the body’s ability to produce Interferon Alpha in response to viral infections and may be associated with higher mortality in elderly patients. If given early during infection, the drug can replace this deficiency and aid a faster recovery process.Patients on Pegylated Interferon Alpha 2b during the trial also showed lesser need for supplemental oxygen, indicating that it was able to control respiratory distress and failure that has been one of the major challenges in treating Covid-19.“The findings are in line with recently reported importance of early IFN treatment given in combination with steroids in the treatment of COVID-19 (Lu et al, Signal Transduction and Targeted Therapy (2021) 6:107, a Nature publication. With these positive results, the Company has applied for an approval for additional indication with the DCGI for the use of PegIFN in the treatment of COVID 19,” said the company.The Phase 3 trials were conducted on 250 patients across 20-25 centres in India, and the company is in the process of publishing detailed results of the trials in a peer-reviewed scientific journal.“We are encouraged by the results of Phase 3 study of Pegylated Interferon alpha 2b which has confirmed the potential to reduce virus titres when given earlier in the disease. With Indian Innovation at the forefront helping the country fight the pandemic with diagnostics, vaccines and therapeutics, this marks an important milestone. At Zydus, we stand committed to our endeavour of supporting patients and caregivers with access to treatment options that are affordable and can help in better disease management of COVID 19 at different stages,” said Sharvil Patel, managing director, Cadila Healthcare Ltd.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sputnik-maker-ties-up-with-indian-firm-to-produce-100-mn-doses-101617648615123.html
06-04-2021||India||Consider meet on CBI chief before May 2: SC||The Supreme Court on Monday expressed its concern at one of India’s top federal investigating agencies, the Central Bureau of Investigation, continuing to work under an interim chief, and asked it why a new one could not be appointed this month itself.“In-charge arrangement for the CBI director cannot go on...why can’t you do it earlier? You must consider doing it before May 2,” the bench told attorney general KK Venugopal, who represented the Centre in the top court, which was hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) by NGO Common Cause on the appointment of a a full-time CBI director.Not finding favour with the government’s submission that it would continue with an ad-hoc arrangement till the ongoing assembly elections end in the first week of May (results are to be announced on May 2), the bench of justices L Nageswara Rao and Vineet Saran wanted to know why a meeting of the selection committee to pick the new director can’t be held in the current month itself.The selection committee comprises the prime minister, the chief justice of India (CJI) and the leader of the single largest opposition party in the Lok Sabha. The tenure of former CBI director Rishi Kumar Shukla ended on February 3. A day later, Gujarat cadre IPS officer and additional director Praveen Sinha was appointed as the interim chief of the agency.On Monday, Venugopal submitted that the meeting of the selection committee was scheduled for May 2 and that after Shukla’s retirement, the senior most person in the agency was made in-charge.“The acting chief is there is because of the convenience of all the members of the selection committee, including the CJI,” said Venugopal.But Venugopal’s statements did not go down well with advocate Prashant Bhushan, who appeared for the petitioner.Also Read | CBI team to reach Mumbai on Tuesday to probe Anil Deshmukh“First, they have violated the Supreme Court’s order which was clear that there cannot be an acting chief of CBI. Second, why has the meeting been fixed on May 2? Is it to supersede the present CJI and wait for the next chief to sit over the meeting? There has to be a reason why they want the present CJI not to oversee this appointment,” Bhushan contended. CJI SA Bobde is set to retire on April 23. Justice NV Ramana will take over on April 24.Bhushan’s arguments triggered an intervention from solicitor general Tushar Mehta, who also appeared for the government and the department of personnel and training (DoPT).“I strongly object to such insinuations . This is an abuse of the process of law. What kind of public interest is being advanced by abusing all institutions ? Such submissions challenge the majesty of this court. What is his locus? ,” submitted Mehta.Mehta added that the meeting of the selection committee was deferred since there were elections going on in various states and the appointment might have some repercussions.However, the court remained unimpressed with the law officers’ explanation. “Why can’t you do it early?. You must do it before May. Consider this...There is a point in what Bhushan says that there is no concept of having an acting chief,” retorted the bench.Asking the government to put on record its formal reply , the bench posted the matter on April 16 and said that it would pass the final order on the next date of hearing.The PIL has sought a direction to the Centre “to appoint a regular director of CBI forthwith by following the procedure laid down in Section 4A of the Delhi Special Police Establishment Act, 1946, as amended by the Lokpal and Lokayuktas Act, 2013.”Under the amended law, the CBI director’s appointment has to be made on the recommendation of the PM, leader of the single largest Opposition party and the CJI (or a Supreme Court judge nominated by the CJI).The NGO has also urged the apex court to direct the Centre to, in the future, initiate and complete the process of selection of the CBI director well in advance -- at least one to two months before the date on which the vacancy occurs .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/consider-meet-on-cbi-chief-before-may-2-sc-101617648495026.html
06-04-2021||India||Cases spike in Bengal amid election season, officials say norms flouted||The daily count of Covid-19 cases in poll-bound West Bengal has shot up nine times ever since the Election Commission announced the dates for the crucial assembly elections to 294 seats on February 26, data released by the state health department showed.The death rate, however, remained unaffected.The number of active cases has more than doubled since March 27, when polling for the first phase was held in 30 seats. Due to the sudden spike, private hospitals are fast running out of hospital beds while the occupancy in government ones has seen a sharp rise, the daily health bulletin revealed.Data available with the state health department showed that while only 216 new cases were reported from across the state on February 26, the daily count rose to 1,957 on April 4. The number of active cases stood at 4,608 on March 27 but increased to 10,153 on April 4.While polling for the first two phases for 60 seats are over, six more phases are yet to be conducted. The third phase, covering 31 constituencies across three districts, will be held on Tuesday.“With elections underway, political parties are organising public rallies and road shows everyday where thousands of people are gathering. Precautions such as social distancing and wearing masks have taken a back seat. Under such circumstances, there has been a staggering rise in Covid cases,” Sukumar Mukherjee, member of an expert committee set up in 2020 to advise chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Covid-related matters, said.On February 26, Bengal reported three deaths while on April 4, it registered four.Only 198 out of 6,736 beds (around 3 per cent) were occupied in government hospitals on February 26. However, the occupancy rate rose to nearly 12 per cent with 665 out of 5,604 beds booked on April 3.The situation appeared to be worse in private hospitals. On February 26, only around 25 per cent of the 1,007 hospital beds were occupied. In the wake of the spike, hospitals gradually began to increase the number of beds and 659 out of 1,077 beds (around 61 per cent) were booked on April 3. At least 11 hospitals in and around Kolkata have run out of beds.As witnessed in the past, maximum cases were reported from Kolkata and North 24 Parganas. Of the 1,957 infections on April 4, around 56 per cent were reported from these two districts. While the daily Covid count stood at 634 in Kolkata, it was 462 in North Parganas.The state government has ramped up testing from around 20,000 in February-end to over 26,000 now.“While on one hand, we need to increase our testing, we also need to go for contact tracing of the infected persons. Isolation of the infected person and a proper surveillance is very important. All these have taken a back seat along with maintaining safety protocols as a result of which, the cases are rising,” Manas Gumta, general secretary of Association of Health Service Doctors in the state, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cases-spike-in-bengal-amid-election-season-officials-say-norms-flouted-101617648314976.html
06-04-2021||India||Only 11% people say compliance to social distancing norms, masks is good: Survey||Only one in three respondents to a survey on compliance with Covid appropriate behaviour believe that people are adhering to social distancing norms and wearing masks in their districts. The survey by community social media platform, LocalCircles, suggested that compliance to social distancing norms and wearing masks was better at vaccination centres but still falls below the standards needed to stop the disease from spreading.The survey findings based on responses from people living in metros, towns and rural areas coincides with an alarming surge in cases of coronavirus disease being reported from several parts of the country, prompting calls for aggressive enforcement of Covid-appropriate behaviours in public such as masking and social distancing to help slow down its spread.The LocalCircles survey report said only 11% of respondents felt there was “good compliance” to both social distancing and wearing a mask in their city or district. Another 23% said there was “limited compliance to both; wearing a mask and social distancing”.The proportion of people who felt that there was effective compliance to wearing masks at vaccination centres was higher. Nearly 74% of respondents said there was effective compliance to wearing masks at vaccination centres but only 44% felt that said compliance to social distancing norms was effective.“The findings of the poll indicated that 44% of citizens feel that there is effective compliance to wearing a mask when travelling at airports, railway stations, or bus stands. Only 15% said compliance to social distancing norms is effective,” a statement by LocalCircles said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/only-11-people-say-compliance-to-social-distancing-norms-masks-is-good-survey-101617639491447.html
06-04-2021||India||Night curfews in force, schools closed as states increase curbs||A large part of India is now under restrictions not seen since the lockdown was eased last year, with night curfews, restrictions on certain businesses, closing of schools and colleges, and tight curbs on the number of people allowed to gather being imposed in at least six states where Covid-19 infections have grown.The strictest of the measures are in Maharashtra, where authorities imposed a night and weekend curfew, ordered non-essentials businesses shut, and asked most offices to switch to remote working.Night curfews are one of the most common non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) used in other states as well. These include districts in Punjab, Rajasthan and Gujarat.Click here for complete Covid-19 coverageAlmost all non-election states have limited the number of people that can attend public events.On Monday, there were 95,461 new cases of Covid-19 across the country. This number was lower than the 103,769 recorded a day before, but this could largely be due to a fall in testing that is typical of weekends. India is now recording the highest number of cases in a day in the world and has surpassed the first wave peak in September when the number stayed under 100,000.Maharashtra has accounted for well over 50% of new Covid cases in the country every day over the past week, with Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Punjab and West Bengal also reporting a spurt in cases.Unlike April of 2020, there are only few places where complete lockdowns have been announced: Durg in Chhattisgarh has imposed a nine-day lockdown that begins April 6. Earlier, a 60-hour lockdown was imposed in Maharashtra’s Wardha district, which ended on April 1. In MP’s Indore, Jabalpur and Bhopal, a 36-hour lockdown ended on March 30.Among states that have opted for night curfews are Punjab, where 10 of 23 districts have such curbs, Rajasthan, where it applies to 10 towns including the capital Jaipur, and in three cities of Gujarat. In Chhattisgarh, 16 of 27 districts including the state capital Raipur have a night lockdown.The curbs come at a time when officials and experts worry hospital capacity may buckle under the weight of cases. The Covid-19 resources dashboard in Pune showed there were no hospital beds available on Monday.Dr Giridhara R Babu, an expert with the Public Health Foundation of India, said Bengaluru is on track to record 6,500 daily cases by April 20. “Even if 10 per cent of them require hospitalisation, the health system will run out of capacity in a few days. We need action now, not tomorrow. Stay home people, wear masks if going out and get a vaccine when eligible,” the epidemiologist said in a tweet.In Delhi, where the government has ordered hospitals to keep more beds for Covid-19 patients, hospitals said the situation is concerning. “The cases are rising exponentially. The pace at which the number of cases went up this time around did not give us time to ramp up the capacity. The situation is heading towards what it was during November,” said Dr Rommel Tickoo, director of internal medicine, at Max Healthcare.The current wave of infections has also led almost all states to close down all education institutions, including coaching centers. On Monday, students protested in Bihar’s Sasaram district against the government’s order to close down all coaching institutes.Maharashtra, Delhi, Gujarat and Tamil Nadu have said schools will be shut indefinitely, while Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Bihar and Punjab have suspended classes for a brief period.Restrictions have also been placed on public events as most states capped the maximum number of people at weddings to 100 people and at funerals to 50. Maharashtra and Gujarat have banned all public events, while Maharashtra has also shut down restaurants and eateries for dine-in.Unlike the previous lockdown, no state has imposed any restriction on industries or marketplaces, fearing further dent to the economy, although experts have said such steps may be unavoidable.On almost no restrictions in Delhi, the state health minister Satyendar Jain said: “We should not see Delhi in isolation. The whole country is witnessing a massive surge in cases. Delhi has seen worse surges before.”Dr Lalit Kant, former head of the division of epidemiology and communicable diseases in the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), said that states, including Delhi, need to accelerate vaccination drive and scale up tests, contact tracing and containment efforts.(With inputs from state bureaus)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/night-curfews-in-force-schools-closed-as-states-increase-curbs-101617648255006.html
06-04-2021||India||Telangana, Andhra report spike in Covid-19 infections; positive cases cross 1,000||Telangana and Andhra Pradesh have witnessed a multi-fold jump in the number of Covid-19 cases in the last four weeks, though the intensity of the pandemic in both states is not as high as the neighbouring states of Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh and Karnataka.As per the official figures, in Telangana, the number of positive cases, which were around 150 in the first week of March, shot up to 1,321 on April 4 - the highest that the state reported this year. However, the number came down to 1,097 by Sunday night.Click here for complete Covid-19 coverage“There has been a decline in the number of Covid-19 cases in Telangana since the second week of January when the first wave of vaccination process began. The number was hovering around 100 cases. But from the second week of March, there has been an increase in the number of cases,” a health department official said.The official state health bulletins indicated that there has been a steady rise in the number of positive cases in the last month, with periodical fluctuations. Even the number of fatalities due to Covid-19, which were around one or two, has now gone up to around six deaths per day.“But the situation is not very alarming. Despite rising infections across the country, the number of Covid-19 cases has continued to remain under control in Telangana,” health minister Eatala Rajender told reporters after a video conference with Union health minister Harsh Vardhan on Monday.Rajender said the infection spread is mostly confined to urban areas like Hyderabad, Medchal-Malkajgiri and the surrounding areas. Unlike last year, so far hospitalisations due to Covid-19 infections have remained under control, he said.Rajender urged the Centre to provide more Covid-19 vaccine stock so that the vaccination process could be expedited across Telangana.The minister said all the government hospitals across Telangana had adequate staff, stock of medicine and liquid oxygen for Covid-19 positive patients. “There is an adequate number of beds available at private and government hospitals and there is no need to panic. We are confident that Telangana should be able to contain any further spread of infections,” Rajender said.At present, the total number of positive cases in the state stood at 3,13,237 while the cumulative number of deaths was at 1,723. As of Sunday, there were 8,746 active Covid-19 cases in the State.In Andhra Pradesh, too, there has been a sudden spurt in the number of Covid-19 positive cases. On March 1, the number of positive cases was just 58 which went up to 1,326 on Monday. The state reported the highest number of cases (1,730) on Sunday, the highest this year. The number of deaths, which were zero on the first of March, has now gone up to five.“Vaccination is the only solution to tackle the Covid-19 infections. We have intensified the vaccination programme and have targeted to vaccinate 90 lakh people,” health commissioner Katamaneni Bhaskar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/telangana-andhra-report-spike-in-covid-19-infections-positive-cases-cross-1000-101617647364907.html

Four other students allegedly involved in the crime have also been isolated, said the institute.Facing criticism for the way it handled of the incident, the premier institute has also assured enhanced security measures to prevent such incidents in future.“[The accused] has been suspended from the institute with immediate effect from April 4 as recommended by the students disciplinary committee,” said a statement issued by IITG on Monday, 8 days after the alleged rape.The student, who hails from Mumbai, was arrested by Amingaon police in Kamrup district on Saturday. Though IITG authorities haven’t yet mentioned the nature of the sexual assault, police have registered a case of rape under section 376 of IPC.“Four other students have been isolated from each other on campus and will be retained on campus for further police investigations as well as internal investigations,” the IITG statement read.Police questioned the four on Saturday on suspicion of them being involved in the crime, helping the arrested accused or trying to hide evidence after the assault.Also Read | Bombay HC seeks stronger laws as man freed in daughter’s rape case “Our investigations are underway. We will arrest others if there is any evidence of their involvement in the crime,” Kamrup superintendent of police Hitesh Chandra Roy said.Terming the incident as a “serious violation of disciplinary rules of the institute”, IITG said it compromised the safety, security of students, hostel boarders and residents of the campus. “The institute condemns such heinous acts in the strongest possible terms. The institute is also putting in place enhanced safety and security measures to prevent such incidents from occurring in the future,” it read.The authorities of IITG are facing flak for reporting the matter to the police five days after the alleged rape, on April 2, and also for allegedly taking the survivor from Guwahati Medical College Hospital (GMCH), where she was taken after the incident, against doctor’s advice.“The institute would like to clarify that the medical report is awaited only after which the nature of the assault can be confirmed. Also, all due procedures were followed as per the hospital guidance for discharge of the girl student,” the statement read.Doctors at GMCH said the student was brought to the hospital at 12.50am on March 29 and taken from there by IITG authorities around 4.30am the same day, saying she will be treated at the institute’s hospital within the campus.“The student was unconscious when she arrived. When she regained consciousness, she said she was sexually assaulted. We conducted a gynecological test and a forensic exam as per the protocol. Despite our advice, IITG authorities took her away on their own responsibility,” said a senior doctor on condition of anonymity.The woman’s medical report is awaited. On Saturday, a statement by IITG said she was “safe and recovering well”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/education/competitive-exams/iitguwahati-suspends-student-accused-of-raping-batch-mate-puts-4-in-isolation-101617601873840.html
06-04-2021||Today's||Why don’t voters value health care?||You get what you ask for. With several states in election mode, the obvious question is — what are people asking for? If the citizens of India are not getting what they need on health, education and other social policy fronts, are they are not asking for them?Data from the CSDS-Lokniti 2019 post-poll survey highlighted development as the most important priority for voters (14.3% of voters surveyed), followed by unemployment, price rise, corruption and economy. Health/hospital facilities were mentioned as a key issue by a mere 0.3% of the sample. The 2014 post-poll survey had similar results, with health mentioned by 0.4% of the sample as a key priority.Assembly polls seem to be no different. Lokniti’s Bihar post-poll data from the 2020 assembly elections shows development, unemployment/jobs/recruitment/lack of industries, and inflation to be the top three issues for voters. Health was important for 0.3% of the respondents. A pre-poll survey for Delhi highlighted development, employment/unemployment/lack of jobs, education and nationalism as key issues. The 2016 pre-poll survey in Kerala found 0.2% of people surveyed rating health care as the most important issue for their voting choice. Clearly, health doesn’t seem to be a priority driving voting behaviour. This is not surprising, it may be argued, in a context where citizens lack the basics of income, water and roads. Where it is indeed surprising, however, is in the context of the financial implications of health care.Health-related expenditures are estimated to push approximately 3.5% of the population below the poverty line every year; with those below the poverty line pushed deeper into poverty. Research by Anirudha Krishna across India, Africa and Latin America found health-related expenses to be the prime reason for households descending into poverty (even when income had been secure to begin with) and that millions of households live “one illness away” from poverty. This means that even as citizens (rightly) prioritise income, health-related expenditures can so easily and dramatically change the economic status of households. Better health systems and services are key to prevent this health-related descent into poverty; yet this is not an electoral ask from citizens.The reality is that the middle-class has exited from the use of public services. Increasingly, the poor are moving in the same direction, towards private health and education services, with 70% of in-patient care and 80% of ambulatory services provided by the private sector. In such a situation, who then will demand better public health services?At a macro-level, research has highlighted the links between building human capital (through health and education) and growth. For a large number of Indian citizens, health, education, and nutritional levels constrain effective participation in many sectors, positioning them not merely as welfare issues, but equally a potential influencer of India’s growth, but health still does not find adequate place in India’s growth strategy. With little citizen-demand, and limited appreciation of the health-economy link, it is not surprising that political and electoral attention to health has been limited. This has resulted in India’s health having one of the lowest public investments at approximately 1.3% of the Gross Domestic Product; disproportionate use of private services which are extremely fragmented, with solo providers and individual clinics comprising 95% of the private ambulatory market; and 64% of health care expenditure being out-of-pocket at the point of service.It is not that policy solutions are not known. It is rather a case of health losing out as a priority in the heavily-contested policy space; a space driven by political incentives. The incentives to develop a strong health system, with benefits at the household as well as national/state level, are obvious; yet, political priority in this direction remains elusive. Other countries, as also some Indian states, have understood the electoral significance of health. Reforms in Turkey, Mexico, Thailand (to name just a few) were built on an electoral foundation. Priority to health insurance schemes in India has been linked with electoral gains. Yet, attention to the health sector in any meaningful manner has not been visible.This gives rise to several questions. Is building human capital not viewed as nation-building, and, thus, lacks political primacy? Does India’s federal and multi-layered governance system prevent clarity on who gets credit from health care services, diffusing potential electoral gains? Or is reforming the health care system too long-term an agenda, not conducive to immediate electoral gains, which are easier with health benefits delivered in a clientelist mode? For citizens, is a health crisis a sporadic emergency over which they have no control (in an almost fatalistic way), because of which responsibility for health care is neither accorded to themselves nor their leaders?Admittedly, the battlefield of elections seems to be increasingly moving away from the direct issues that impact the quality of life of citizens. Identity as an electoral issue, long dominant, but now predominant, has taken on newer forms such as nationalism, driving voter behaviour in a direction further away from issues of health, education, and social protection. More needs to be done to ensure that first, citizens understand the location and primacy of health in their aspirational journey and its impact on their economic status, and ask for better health care, and second, that national and state leaders acknowledge the role of health in a nation and State’s economic journey.

06-04-2021||Today's||Maoism remains India’s biggest internal security threat||In one of the bloodiest battles fought between the Communist Party of India (Maoist) and security forces in the Terram jungle of Chhattisgarh’s Bijapur district, 22 elite fighters from the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) and its elite Cobra battalion, District Reserve Guard (DRG) and Special Task Force (STF) lost their lives along with, reportedly, an equal number of Maoists. The five-hour-long fierce encounter on Saturday witnessed the use of light machine guns and AK-47s by the Maoists, with security forces responding in equal measure, deploying under-barrel grenade launchers and mortars against targets picked up by Heron (an unmanned aerial vehicle). Most deaths and injuries took place when, during the fierce phase of the firefight, security personnel moved the wounded to the huts at Tekulgudam village, unaware that the village along with two others, Jeera Gaon and Jonaguda, had been vacated on the diktat of the Maoists in a well-planned strategy. Once the force was trapped, relentless fire from the enemy positions caused further damage.This was part of a joint operation launched by the districts of Bijapur and Sukma on late Friday night, on reliable information about the presence of the dreaded Maoist commander in the area, Madvi Hidma. The operation was aimed at targeting multiple locations, and comprised around 2,000 security personnel. The group, which was targeted by the Maoists, was 450-men strong. They did not walk into a trap. Nor were they ambushed. A movement of 2,000 men would surely alert the Maoists and the force has to be prepared for such exigencies. The Heron would have picked up Maoist movements — so it was a fair and square fight where equal numbers were lost on both sides. An enquiry will reveal the real truth and the lapses of strategy and tactics. But the security personnel displayed grit and valour, fighting heroically for five hours till the Maoists broke their ranks and retreated.This is yet another grim reminder of the capability of Maoist cadres to lie low for long periods, regroup and strike at intervals. An improvised explosive device (IED) mine blasted a bus carrying security men last month, killing three. In March 2020, in an ambush in Sukma, the Maoists killed 17 security personnel.The downward trend of Maoist violence over the last few years has led the government and some security analysts to declare that the battle against Maoism (or Naxalism, as the terms are interchangeably used) is almost won. According to the annual report of the ministry of home affairs (MHA), Maoist violence was restricted to 251 police stations (PS) in 60 districts of eight states in 2018, in comparison with 330 PSs in 76 districts of 10 states in 2013. In the first half of 2020, it was restricted to 46 districts. The incidents of violence (670) and deaths of security personnel were the lowest in 2019, as per the available official figures.Despite data revealing an overall reduction in violence, the capacity of Left-wing extremists to retaliate with ferocity indicates that Maoism still remains the biggest threat to our internal security, almost 11 years after then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh acknowledged and framed the scale of threat in exactly this manner. Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand lie in the eye of the storm. Out of 670 incidents of Naxal violence in 2019, 463, ie 69%, occurred in these two states. The Maoists are entrenched in the jungles in these two states, and intelligence agencies, at great risk, glean their activities and plans, as deliberated upon in their central committee meetings, and share it with other central forces and state police.But if statistics belie the real situation on the ground, what is lacking in the government’s approach towards fighting Maoism? Is a course-correction in combat strategy also desired? First, senior police commanders will have to rethink the rationale of large-scale operations. The stakes are too high and heavy losses of men are causes of serious worry. It is important to change tactics according to the situation. The Greyhounds of undivided Andhra Pradesh, a specialised force that achieved great success in weakening the Maoists, conducted their operations with small-sized teams, acting on pinpoint intelligence. Even their platoon strength team had a clear chain of command.Second, there is a complete administrative and security vacuum in such areas to counter the Janatana Sarkar of Maoists run through their Revolutionary People Committee (RPC), equivalent to gram panchayats. For instance, allegations abound of RPCs seizing grains distributed under the public distribution system and distributing it under their aegis. The erosion of State authority is also reflected in the fact that civilians often act as the eyes and ears of the Maoists in affected areas. While extending roads and hoisting mobile towers have certainly helped, CRPF will have to set up its camps deeper in the jungles. The Rural Roads Programme (RRP) aimed at constructing 5,411 kms and connecting 44 Naxal-affected districts, must also be speeded up as most of these districts fall in Chhattisgarh.And, finally, managing India’s internal security cannot be a part-time job. There are too many challenges, and too many critical decisions to be made on a regular basis. An internal security ministry needs to be hived off from the MHA — the secretary of the ministry must be a specialist, either a serving or retired police officer of outstanding reputation, and this must be supervised by a full-time minister who is hands-on. This cannot afford to wait any longer.Yashovardhan Azad is a former IPS officer, who served as Central Information Commissioner, secretary, security and special director, Intelligence Bureau.

06-04-2021||Today's||Democracy, Israel’s prized possession, is facing a grave risk||Israel is known for its hard power — conjuring up images of its military strength, intelligence apparatus, arms diplomacy, and a developed economy. Israel achieved all of these in the last seven decades, in spite of its existential issues since 1948 amid multiple regional wars. Since soft power is also an important consideration, Israel has presented itself, legitimately, as the only democracy in West Asia.But the last four elections in Israel — in April and September 2019, March 2020 and on March 23, 2021 — have exposed the inner workings of its democracy. Among leading democracies, Israel now has had the most frequent number of national elections in recent years, and its democratically elected governments have survived for an average of 2.3 years rather than a four-year term since 1996. In the last two years, Israel has gone to the polls four times, and it may well go for a fifth round if there is no one leader capable of forming a coalition government with 61 seats (out of 120 total seats in parliament). Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s party, Likud, has 30 seats, but he is opposed by a variety of different political leaders who are otherwise of the same ideological bent such as Benny Gantz, Yair Lapid or Gideon Saar.Netanyahu once worked well with all these leaders at different times but now faces stiff resistance. He is also going through a legal trial for three criminal cases — bribery, fraud and breach of trust. Looking at the major issues and slogans of the last four elections, it is clear that Israeli society is polarised on one big issue — are you with Netanyahu or against him? All other issues — from Covid-19 and its severe impact on the Israeli economy to the lack of an annual budget since 2018, from rising prices to the fact that Israel has high unemployment — have all got relegated to the background as the electorate stands deeply divided over Netanyahu, who has served more than a decade as prime minister.Netanyahu has refused to resign from office or leave politics until his name is cleared by the court. He fought this election while on trial and he may very well stake claim to form the government soon. What makes him so indispensable within certain pockets of Israeli society is his perceived strong position on security and his diplomatic acumen. National security plays a crucial role in Israeli domestic politics as well as in its foreign policy. Henry Kissinger once said that Israel does not have a foreign policy, but domestic politics which is over-concerned with security. Netanyahu has projected himself as a leader who will fight the world for Israel and the Jews, and has navigated international politics to ensure that Israel does not have to accept a two-state solution on the Palestinian issue. His followers rate him highly for ensuring American recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, and for the Abraham Accords, which led to a a rapprochement with Arab states such as United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Morocco and Sudan. His excellent personal relationship with leaders such as Narendra Modi and Vladimir Putin is seen as a source of strength for Israel. On the charges of corruption, his followers think they are conspiracies.Israeli will do well with a democratic State rather than a narrowly defined security-military-capable State. For long, Israel has focused on carving out domestic unity around the issue of fighting the external enemy. But some crises are internal. Israel needs to look within and find ways to overcome its domestic political deadlock and find common ground between its liberal social norms and an increasingly inward and polarised polity.

06-04-2021||Editorials||From 1980 to 2021, the BJP’s journey||If there is one political story that captures the shift in Indian politics over the last four decades, it is that of the birth, failure, success, failure, and then even greater success of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). On April 6, 1980, the BJP was born. While acknowledging its roots in the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, in a sign that it would be distinct ideologically, the party adopted Gandhian socialism as one of its founding principles.The BJP, under Atal Bihari Vajpayee, in the initial years, faltered electorally, which led to the rise of LK Advani as the party chief. Mr Advani steered the party towards Hindutva, the most powerful symbol of which was the Ram temple movement. This made secularism a contested word, spawned an entire generation of activists who are today at the top of the BJP leadership, and made the party one of the poles of Indian politics. But India wasn’t ready for this brand of politics, and it was by returning to Mr Vajpayee’s moderate avatar that the BJP was finally able to win power.The party, under Narendra Modi, is now the primary pole in Indian politics. It has become, arguably, even more committed to the Hindutva project, while appealing to the subaltern, expanding in newer areas, carving out multi-class and multi-caste alliances, and creating the most formidable election machine India has ever seen. Mr Modi said, on Tuesday, however, that BJP was not an election machine but a campaign to win over the hearts of citizens. This is an important message, but to truly operationalise it, the BJP must become a more inclusive party, reflecting India’s social diversity. It need not be socialist, but turning to Gandhi, as was originally pledged in 1980, will help.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/from-1980-to-2021-the-bjp-s-journey-101617715039730.html
