30-04-2021||News||In Bengal, the X factor — women and welfare||On a sweltering afternoon in a village in West Bengal’s Nabadwip constituency, a young man in his 20s called us into his home for a respite. He had returned to the state before the lockdown last year from Ahmedabad and expressed diffident support for Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi — although he was less sure about whom he would support in the high-stakes election battle between the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Trinamool Congress (TMC) in the state. We asked him whether he received any help during the lockdown. He didn’t answer. His newlywed wife, who had been listening from a distance, quickly interjected, “We received rations from Didi (big sister, a standard moniker for chief minister Mamata Banerjee).” Her mother-in-law, the young man’s mother, added, “Didi gives us everything,” before rattling off government benefits offered and schemes launched by the incumbent Trinamool Congress (TMC) government. As the conversation turned to PM Modi, the young woman made a sour face and answered curtly, “I don’t like him very much.” Click here for complete coverage of West Bengal assembly electionsA significant proportion of women we met during the election campaign in Bengal were enthusiastic in support for Banerjee and the TMC, and, often, their views differed from men in the household. Unlike any other election state, Modi’s welfarism was rarely discussed in West Bengal and a number of women expressed strong disapproval with him — likely the political fallout of a public rivalry between the CM and the PM.By now, it is no secret that for the BJP to win West Bengal outright, it will need to win the support of nearly two-thirds of voters from the Hindu community because it will win few votes among the Muslim community — about 30% of West Bengal’s electorate. In order to pull it through, the TMC is banking on women’s support as a bulwark against observably high Hindu-Muslim polarisation. Only the results on May 2 will help ascertain whether women’s support was sufficient to keep the TMC in power. But irrespective of the outcome, the West Bengal election signals a major shift in the role of women in electoral politics. Privately, psephologists and party workers suggest that the difference in women’s and men’s voting preferences in the state is among the highest they have ever seen. And this has forced all parties to treat women voters as a separate political entity to be targeted with schemes and reservations — much like caste in North India. So what accounts for Banerjee’s popularity in this constituency? Certainly, there is the notion of identity, as Banerjee is the only woman chief minister in India. Indeed, a woman shopkeeper in Pandua constituency pointedly told us, “Mamata Banerjee is in each one of us.” And some highly publicised unfortunate comments about women by BJP leaders were mentioned as well as those derisive of the CM and her identity. But the type of support one sees on the ground goes beyond the basic rubric of identity-based support. To unpack this further, one needs to look at how the TMC has designed welfare benefits. Also Read | BJP disses exit poll predictions on Bengal, accepts those on AssamFirst, the TMC has made women the overwhelming beneficiaries of its schemes. Two schemes have been noteworthy: Kanyashree, which gives poor households a one-time grant of ₹25,000 for educating women up to the age of 18, and Rupashree, that gives another ₹25,000 to women in poor families if an underage marriage does not take place. The scheme design is important as well. There is less chance of corruption or control by men because the money is deposited as a direct transfer into the beneficiary’s bank account, just like in many central schemes. The scale of money transferred to women in poorer families immediately gives them control over significant financial resources and plausibly engenders greater bargaining power within the household. Equally as important has been the branding of these schemes. Due to the universal nature of the scheme, and the mode of direct transfer, even BJP supporters admit that they have received these benefits. Armed with significant ground presence, and the branding of Mamata Banerjee as “Bengal’s daughter,” each person we spoke to attributed these schemes, and other TMC schemes, to the CM. Indeed, this is a phenomenon reminiscent of PM Modi’s campaigning around gas cylinders. But given the sheer scale of welfare benefits given the TMC government, people rarely speak of Modi’s benefit schemes — the fact that all central schemes have not been implemented by the state government perhaps adds to this narrative dominance. This has allowed the TMC to position itself as the only party that can deliver significant benefits to the women of Bengal. A section of analysts have retreated to antiquated notions of gender, arguing that women almost always vote as their husbands or fathers would wish of them. I have been doing fieldwork around elections in West Bengal for over a decade. And I have long noticed that women espouse independent political preferences, much more than other states in India. In fact sometimes it’s the women influencing the men. Back in the village in Nabadwip constituency, it was time to move to our next destination. As we left, after hearing his wife and mother sing praises of Mamata Banerjee, the young man finally offered an opinion, “It’s probably best that Mamata Banerjee stays as the chief minister.” Neelanjan Sircar is an assistant professor at Ashoka University and senior visiting fellow at the Centre for Policy ResearchThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/in-bengal-the-x-factor-women-and-welfare-101619783388100.html
30-04-2021||Bangalore||In a first, Drones deployed for sanitisation and medicine delivery in Bengaluru||Karnataka chief minister BS Yediyurappa on Friday inaugurated an initiative to use drones to sanitise containment zones as well as deliver medicines and essential goods to the affected people.Talking to the media during the inauguration, the chief minister said, “During these difficult times, it is very important to supply timely delivery of emergency medicines and Covid vaccines. I’m happy that for the first time in the country, drones are ready to supply medicines and also for sanitising public places (in Bengaluru),” he said. The drones with a capacity to ferry 35-40 kilograms of materials can be used for delivering medicines and essential goods besides sanitising the areas. The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) recently granted the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) a conditional exemption for testing the feasibility of drones in delivering vaccines. A task force led by MP for Bengaluru central, PC Mohan, has tied up with a start-up Garuda Aerospace for the purpose. “For the first time in India, drone delivery of vaccines will undergo feasibility analysis and field trials in Karnataka. If successful, this could be a breakthrough in ensuring Covid-19 vaccines reach remote villages in Karnataka and geographically isolated locations across India,” Mohan said. Bengaluru’s civic body, Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) special commissioner Rajendran Cholan IAS said that automated robots can eliminate human contact in the entire distribution process. “Front line workers who transport vaccines from one location to another could themselves be carriers of the virus,” he said. Bengaluru Urban district alone on Friday witnessed 26,756 fresh Covid-19 infections and 93 deaths, taking the total active cases in the city to 2,59,058 and deaths to 6,375 since the outbreak of the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/in-a-first-drones-deployed-for-sanitisation-and-medicine-delivery-in-bengaluru-101619807389338.html

For some assembly seats, agents have been alerted that the TMC may lag in the first few rounds but would ultimately have the last smile. So, the agents should not leave their seats at any point of time feeling dejected,” said a candidate, who attended the meeting.“She also advised that counting agents, at no point in time, should accept any food, drinks or even cigarettes from anyone. A mobile number has also been given to everyone, which would act as a helpline if the agents and candidates face any problem,” another candidate added.Samik Bhattacharya, BJP spokesperson in West Bengal, said, “She (Banerjee) may give a last-minute vocal tonic to her candidates, but BJP would have the last smile and would win more than 200 seats as projected by Amit Shah. It’s now a matter of just a few hours”. The Election Commission of India (ECI) has already announced a three-layer plan on Wednesday to ward off the threat of coronavirus infections during the counting of votes for assembly elections, ordering more counting halls, banning public gatherings outside centres and allowing entry to candidates or polling agents only if they are fully vaccinated or have a Covid negative report.On Friday 48-hours ahead of the polling day preparations were in full swing across all the 108 counting centres and more than 700 counting halls. Candidates and polling agents queued up at various centres to get their Covid-test done. At Howrah, a scuffle broke out between the counting agents when they were standing in a queue to get their tests done. “This year the counting process would be lengthier as all Covid protocols need to be followed and materials would have to be sanitised thoroughly. Unlike previous years when the trend starts showing by 12 noon and 1 pm, this year it may take much longer,” said a poll panel official. The month-long poll season, which began with a high octane political battle between the BJP and the TMC but was overshadowed by the surge in Covid-19 infections in the state, came to an end on April 29. The counting of votes is scheduled for Sunday. Exit poll results for the assembly elections were announced on Thursday. Pollsters projected a cliffhanger in West Bengal, where the TMC is looking to retain power for the third term and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is confident of securing a majority of over 200 seats.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/mamata-banerjee-s-virtual-crash-course-for-candidates-polling-agents-ahead-of-counting-day-101619803909434.html

These seven districts have been chosen as they have a high active caseload. The other districts will be covered later. The state authorities hope to get a supply of 10,000 vaccine doses by Saturday morning.“The seven districts where the vaccination drive will be launched for the beneficiaries above 18 years include Lucknow, Kanpur, Prayagraj, Meerut, Gorakhpur, Bareilly, and Varanasi. Here, the active cases are high. Hence, we begin from these districts and more districts will get the benefit later,” said additional chief secretary (health and family welfare) Amit Mohan Prasad on Friday.“We have taken up those districts where the active cases are over 9,000. There are seven such districts,” said Prasad.In Lucknow, a stock of 3,000 doses of the Covid vaccine has already been kept in cold chain points to be distributed at 10 vaccination centres in the city. These centres have been identified for the vaccination of people above 18 years of age. The stock will be given to the vaccination centres at around 8am, said chief medical officer (Lucknow) Dr Sanjay Bhatnagar.The 10 vaccination centres in Lucknow for the new phase are: King George’s Medical University (KGMU), Dr Ram Manohar Lohia Institute of Medical Sciences (RMLIMS), Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences (SGPGIMS), Lok Bandhu Raj Narain Hospital, Rani Laxmibai Hospital, Civil Hospital, Jhalkaribai Hospital, Awantibai Hospital, Balrampur Hospital and BRD hospital. Each centre will get 300 doses. In Varanasi, chief medical officer Dr VB Singh said a vehicle had been sent to Lucknow for bringing the vaccine doses to Varanasi. The doses were likely to arrive early on Saturday morning. Prayagraj’s district nodal officer for Covid-19 vaccination Dr RS Thakur said 3,000 doses of Covaxin had been received by Prayagraj for vaccination of individuals aged above 18 years. The vaccination will take place from 11am to 5pm at four rural primary health centres in Chaka, Jasra, Kotwa and Jhunsi areas, besides MLN Medical College, Dufferin Hospital, MD Eye Hospital, Railway Hospital and TB Sapru Hospital in the urban areas of Prayagraj. Dr Thakur said the vaccines would be administered to only those individuals who had got themselves registered in advance.A health department officer who did not wish to be named said in view of the uncertainty over the supply of vaccine doses, the state government had decided to run the third phase on a trial basis in the seven districts. The state government hopes that it will get the required doses in the first week of May to launch the drive in the remaining districts. Director general (family welfare) Dr Rakesh Dubey said the private hospitals and medical colleges will have to procure vaccines from the manufacturers to give doses to beneficiaries above 45 years of age and also to those between 18 and 44 years of the age (for the phase commencing on May 1). For earlier phases, the private hospitals and medical colleges had procured the vaccine doses from the state government. The private centres were charging ₹250 per dose from the beneficiaries. To get Covid-19 vaccines for the third phase, the Uttar Pradesh government on Thursday decided to float global tenders to procure four to five crore doses of Covid vaccines.The state government has already placed an order for the supply of one crore Covid vaccine doses —50 lakh doses each from Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech International Limited that manufactures Covaxin and the Pune- based Serum Institute of India (SII) that makes Covishield.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/up-to-give-jabs-to-18-in-seven-districts-first-101619801808391.html
30-04-2021||Bhopal||2 MP men convert bike, auto into mini ambulances to help people amid Covid-19 crisis||Two men in Madhya Pradesh have been helping many amid the Covid-19 crisis by using their bike and auto as ambulances, ferrying Covid-19 patients to the hospitals, HT has learnt.Thirty-four-year-old Javed Khan, an auto driver in Bhopal, converted his auto, which was purchased on loan, into an ambulance after selling his wife’s gold pendant and earrings worth ₹10,000. Mechanical engineer Azeez Khan of Dhar has been using his bike for the same purpose and has spent his savings worth ₹30,000 for the same. They are providing their services free of cost to help the people in need. “During the lockdown, I was sitting at home and reading news that people are facing trouble in reaching hospitals. I thought of helping such people. But I thought just to help them in reaching the hospital is not enough, so I thought of converting my auto into a mini ambulance. The oxygen is one of the most important things for Covid-19 infected patients so I fit an oxygen cylinder in my auto.”“My wife Kishwar Khan helped me financially by giving her gold pendant and earrings. I sold it for ₹10,000. I posted my numbers on social media so that people can contact me any time. As of now, I helped 12 people in Bhopal in the past two weeks,” said Javed.He said, “I have saved some money to repay the loan of my auto but now I am using this money to bear my household expenses.” Khan, 39, said, “I have been working as a fabricator for the past so many years. I read some news that people are facing difficulty in reaching hospitals due to a kutcha road or narrow lane so I thought of developing a bike ambulance. I constructed an attachment with a bed, an oxygen cylinder and a metallic cover. The structure is attached to my bike and this is how I am able to take the patients safely to the hospital.” In the past week, Khan has helped eight people. Javed said, “It takes 4-5 hours and someday more than eight hours to get the cylinders refilled at a centre in Govindpura but it motivates me to help more people.” Although the duo doesn’t charge any money for the services, people are donating money to help them refill oxygen. People who took their services have appreciated their effort. A resident of Awadhpuri, Sunil Dug, said, “I was discharged from the hospital two days ago, I needed an ambulance to reach home but I didn’t get any vehicle till late at night. I saw Javed’s number on a social media platform. I contacted him, he was 12 kilometres away from the hospital but he came and took me to my home which was 13 kilometres from the hospital. When I asked for money, he refused to take any but I donated some money for his welfare service.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/2-mp-men-convert-bike-auto-into-mini-ambulances-to-help-people-amid-covid-19-crisis-101619799349159.html

The wife of the deceased lodged a complaint in this regard with Chouparan police station on Friday.The deceased was identified as Chakkan Bhuinyan, a resident of Machla village in Hazaribag district. According to his wife Babita Devi, she, along with his husband and brother in-law Shankar Bhuiyan, was going to attend a wedding on Thursday around 5.30pm when the incident took place. “On our way at Karma village (around 1km from Machla village), a patrolling police vehicle came and stopped in front of our bike. On enquiry, we told them that we were going to attend a wedding ceremony, but they started beating my husband with sticks. He died on the spot,” Devi alleged.Corroborating Devi’s claim, mukhiya of Karma village, Rajdev Yadav, said, “The incident took place near my residence. Babita and Shankar protested, but the police beat them also. After the brutal thrashing, police left Bhuiyan on the street. We took him to a nearby hospital, where doctors declared him brought dead.”Meanwhile, Barhi deputy superintendent of police (DSP) Nazir Akhtar, who was leading the police investigation in this connection, visited Karma village on Friday and talked to locals. He said, “The body of the deceased was sent to Hazaribagh on Friday for postmortem examination. We are investigating the matter. We will be able to say anything after investigation is completed. Action will be taken if anyone is found guilty in the incident.”Police patrolling vehicles were roaming to ensure no shops are open after the given time limit in a bid to ensure implementation of the ongoing Swasthya Suraksha Saptah, the DSP said, adding, “In light of the lockdown, shops are not allowed to open after 2pm.”Yadav, who is also president of Mukhiya Sangh of Chouparan block, said, “Irate villagers put up a road blockade on Thursday night, demanding action against the police personnel involved in the incident.

The cabinet also gave its nod for allowing the health department to rope in qualified firms to supply medical oxygen to all government hospitals and the policy to encourage setting up of plants for generation of medical oxygen.As the vaccination for all those aged between 18 and 45 was scheduled to start from May 1, the cabinet meeting was scheduled urgently on Friday to approve the fund allocation for vaccine procurement, said a senior official who was present in the meeting. The cabinet meetings are usually held on Tuesdays.Officials, however, said the fresh vaccination drive is unlikely to take off as scheduled for want of adequate doses of vaccines, even though the cabinet approved the release of ₹1000 crore from the total allocation of fund for vaccination. They said the state government had sought supply of around 1 crore doses of vaccines from Serum institute of India (producer of Covishield) and Bharat Biotech (Covaxin), but the firms declined sending the consignment to the state for want of vaccines’ availability. SII and Bharat Biotech had assured to supply the vaccine by 3rd week of May, they said.The department has been allocated ₹90 crore to ensure uninterrupted oxygen supply all medical college and hospitals for the next five years. As per the agreement, the engaged firms are deemed to develop cryogenic storage for liquid oxygen in the hospital premises. Premier medical colleges used to consume medical oxygen worth over ₹2 crore per annum.In another important decision, the cabinet also approved the oxygen policy under which the government would offer up to 30% subsidy on cost of establishing oxygen generation plant to any private investor in the state.The formal press briefing of the cabinet decisions, however, was put off owing to death of Bihar chief secretary Arun Kumar Singh, a 1987-batch IAS officer, due to Covid in a private hospital on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bihar-clears-4-000cr-for-free-vaccination-to-all-aged-18-45-years-101619798508934.html

The court has been hearing the matter in the form of a suo motu PIL. The bench of Justice Chakradhari Sharan Singh and Justice Mohit Kumar Shah was also upset with different facts presented before it regarding allocation of quota of oxygen by the central government. “Previously, we were told 194 MTs of liquid medical oxygen (LMO) had been allocated as daily quota for the state by the Centre in addition to state’s own generation. Now the state counsel says 194 MT quota includes 34 MT generated inside the state, which means the state is entitled to lift 160 MT of LMO only,” the bench added. The court also pointed out that the sources of oxygen supply and the volume, as furnished by the state government, was not adding up. “The least said the better,” the court remarked.Meanwhile, additional solicitor general for India, KN Singh, told the court that the Centre had purchased 102,000 cylinders, of which 2827 D-type cylinders and 13309 B-type cylinders are being allotted to Bihar and the supply will commence by first week of May. “The court expects that the said process is expedited, considering the dire need of medical oxygen and cylinders in different hospitals treating patients,” the bench observed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/hc-pulls-up-state-for-lack-of-info-on-covid-hospitals-care-centres-101619798508234.html

The collector accepted that money meant for commercial sex workers during the pandemic was credited into other accounts. The collector In its report, HT highlighted that part of an amount of ₹7.94 crore, released by the Maharashtra government as financial aid to be paid to commercial sex workers (CSW) in Pune in view of Covid-19 pandemic, was deposited into the bank accounts of maids and waste pickers living in Annabhau Sathe Nagar, Tarawade vasti, Mohammadwadi. “Yes, we received the complaints, I have ordered enquiry. I am busy right throughout for oxygen supply meeting. I have asked the RDC (Resident District Collector),” said Deshmukh through text messages while expressing to share more details given his presence in series of meeting in meetings related to Covid situation. On April 29, Nitin Pawar, president, Hamal Panchayat Samiti and Nitin Waghmare, founder Akhil Bharatiya Bahujan Sena, along with the NGO Saheli and the National Network of Sex Workers presented a statement to the district collector informing him of the misuse of the funds. //While the district collector is still in the process of finalizing the details of the enquiry, the women who had received ₹15,000 for three months are facing a dilemma. The state released ₹7.94 crore and transferred it to 5,296 bank accounts belonging to commercial sex workers in Pune based on a Supreme Court order, dated September 21, 2020, that victims of the flesh trade be compensated by the administration with assistance like provision of food grains and cash. The court ruled that no documentary proof must be taken from victims while delivering the welfare measures and sops. The women from Tarawade vasti signed a consent form by members of an “unknown NGO” gave copies of their Aadhar cards and bank passbooks and paid an additional ₹200 for the service. “We want to return the money, but there is a small problem. We do not have the entire amount with us as the people who filled the forms asked us to pay them ₹7,000 in cash, which some of us have paid already,” said Manjusha Edke, one of the beneficiaries who wants to return the money.

30-04-2021||Mumbai||Malavika’s Mumbaistan: Another Man’s Rancour||In many ways, it is emblematic of a widespread concern: In a world consumed with social media communication, how should one continue communicating on social media during the apocalyptic situation that India and her people currently face? Indeed, when despair and grief have become daily occurrences and when disease and death loom so near at hand, how should people — most likely isolated, anxious and challenged themselves — carry on with what is most likely their only means of engagement with the outside world during these harrowing times? After all, even at the best of times, communication on social media can be a minefield of thin skins, raw feelings and hurt sentiments. Such is the nature of the beast that one man’s opinion can easily become another man’s rancour. Now, in a situation where the smoke from mass cremations obliterates the sun and passions run high and tempers fast, who knows what will or will not trigger another or offend or upset or wound? Of course, as soon as it was evident that the second wave was proving to be substantially more deadly than anything India had witnessed earlier and that the government’s handling of it was woefully inadequate, many had converted their social media platforms into helplines and ersatz bulletins, to marshal support and funding for those in need. But what of the others? Were they to cease their social interface altogether, if it were not strictly pandemic-related? Would anything other than posts about the current crisis be viewed as suspect, callous and inappropriate in these gut-wrenching times? And what of people’s need to express themselves in their authentic voices; would they have to be silenced, or altered to be accepted? “I’m not sure what to do,” a friend posted this week on his social media timeline. “Today I’ve been unfriended by someone who took grave offence over my recent posts which he felt were insensitive to the current crisis, because they alluded to other things, in my case photographs and words about happier, more buoyant times. Besides being hurt, it made me wonder if there was some truth to what he said. What do you all feel?” he enquired. “Should I desist from doing so? I’d be happy to hear your views and be advised by them…” Couched in those simple words was a conundrum that must have had presented itself in some form or the other recently, to perhaps everyone who possessed a smart phone and an internet connection. After all, with the current levels of anguish and pain experienced by almost every body and with the heightened sense of stress and anger that prevailed, who would want to add insult to injury by appearing thoughtless, uncaring or inconsiderate through their communique? One popular food blogger explained his peculiar problem with this post: “While witnessing the unfolding tragedy, I just cannot bring myself to post pictures of the delicious takeaway dishes I’ve ordered in the past few weeks” He wrote, “Even though I know it would help the restaurants and chefs commercially, at a time when their industry is floundering. But I am saving them and promise to upload them at a better time in the future.” His honesty and sincerity had been appreciated by the food and beverages industry and his followers. But God knows, so many others had got it woefully wrong, and daily the ticker toll of those who’d put their foot in their mouth would rise and fall like the Sensex. These included tone-deaf stars who posted pictures of themselves at beach resorts, even as their compatriots faced extreme pain and loss; prominent influencers whose attempts at empathy had been called out as empty buttressing of their images; industrialists whose utterances angered those that regarded them as nothing more than ham-handed PR; and of course politicians, polarising and maladroit at the best of times, who were afforded the brunt of it all, with armies of bigoted trolls from opposing ideologies, waiting to pounce on their every word and wage full blown battles with them. A fashion influencer with over 25,000 followers became a lightning rod for ridicule when she posted that she was “sick of seeing only sad posts about Covid” on her timeline. “Can everyone stop posting sad news and only put up happy posts?” she requested. Expectedly, the backlash was huge, and her peers demanded that she take her post down. “Turn off your social media if you are so disturbed by what you see” was the representative admonishment. “But don’t ask others to stop helping or doing what they can on their own timelines.” But as everything else, opinions were divided on what was appropriate during the crisis. For instance, the staging of the mega million-dollar IPL was seen to be distasteful and extremely inappropriate by many, even as others argued that it afforded them a much-needed coping mechanism to take their minds off the grim reality around them. Still others argued that businesses had to continue for the wheels of the economy to keep turning. Interestingly, our friend who’d sought advice after being unfriended on account of his “inappropriate” posts, harking back to better days, received his answer sooner rather than later through a volley of responses, what came through unequivocally was a resounding call for kindness and compassion through the ongoing calamity, of allowing for more latitude, of being slow to strike, of cutting people slack, of being gentler and more tolerant, of not holding grudges, and of being and letting be… “Healing, coping and carrying on has many dimensions,” read one comment. “One size doesn’t fit all, and we are all finding ways to keep ourselves upbeat during this crisis.” “What one should engage in on one’s own timeline is absolutely personal and cannot be dictated by some other person,” read another, while a third wrote: “I think in these terrible times, all of us need diversions and to be reminded of better days and your posts gave me strength to carry on by reminding me of them.” So, whereas no one really can specify what exactly makes for appropriate communique during a crisis, what people appeared to be saying was that this was a time for maturity and tolerance and for magnanimity and gentleness for oneself and others. “Everyone you meet is fighting a battle you know nothing about” goes the old axiom. “Be kind. Always.” But what of a situation when everyone you were likely to meet faced not an unknown battle, but a very real and present danger in the form of a global pandemic? Shouldn’t kindness and tolerance and a conscious effort to take a break from anger harsh judgement and unkind words be the order of the day?You would think so, given the circumstances, as would most others. But perhaps it is emblematic of our time and the distress and helpless anger that people are currently experiencing, that even a simple call to practice kindness, gentleness and compassion, through these challenging times, could offend a whole section of folks...||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/malavikas-mumbaistan-another-man-s-rancour-101619794669611.html

30-04-2021||Pune||8K minutes of veteran film-artiste interviews available on NFAI website||On the occasion of the 151st birth anniversary of Indian cinema pioneer Dadasaheb Phalke, the National Film Archive of India (NFAI) has published a treasure of audio recordings in the public domain. About 8,000 minutes of interviews of veteran film artistes from the Indian film industry are now made available on the NFAI website. Starting from the silent era of Indian cinema, these are the fascinating tales of journeys of actors, technicians, producers, directors and studio owners. Conducted mostly in the 1980s, these interviews were recorded as part of the oral history project of NFAI’s research programme and features long interviews of pioneering film personalities, narrating the experiences about their life, stories and anecdotes from the world of cinema. “We are delighted to make available this vast treasure of audio recordings which constitutes a rich reference material for anyone who is interested in studying Indian cinema. One of the main objectives of NFAI is to disseminate knowledge about Indian cinema and I am glad that these voices from the past can now be heard across the world,” said Prakash Magdum, director NFAI. There are 53 interviews with the audio recording of about 8,000 minutes duration of film artists conducted in five languages- Marathi, Tamil, Telugu, English and Bengali. The artists include who’s who of the Indian film industry including JBH Wadia, Akkineni Nageshwar Rao, Vijay Bhatt, P Bhanumathi, SD Subbulakshmi, MK Radha, P Leela, C Honnappa Bhagvathar, Zunzarrao Pawar, Dada Salvi, Chandrakant Gokhale, RM Krishnaswamy, SV Venkatraman, R Ramamurthy, KS Prakash, V Gopalakrishnan, R B Lakshmidevi, Shahu Modak, E Mohammed, V V Bapat, Vivek, Vishnupant Jog, Nanasaheb Sathe, Ganpatrao Bondre, Nilu Phule, Sharad Talwalkar, Shobha Sen, Surykant Mandhare, Chittaranjan Kolhatkar and Soumitra Chatterjee among others. The longest interview in the series is of veteran Bengali actor Soumitra Chatterjee taken by Anasua Roy Chaudhary with a duration of 584 minutes. These long interviews not only throw light on the personal journey of these artists but also give an in-depth account of the changes in the Indian film industry over a long period of time. One of the major highlights of the oral history project of NFAI is the interviews of several old associates of DG Phalke who closely worked with the father of Indian cinema. These artists, coming from diverse backgrounds, entered the film industry at its nascent stage and went on to act in roles in Phalke’s Hindustan Cinema Film Company. India’s first child artist and Dadasaheb Phalke‘s daughter Mandakini Phalke Athavale is extensively interviewed where she speaks about working as a child Krishna in Kaliya Mardan (1919). Several of these silent era artists including Ganpatrao Tambat, Sahdevrao Tapkire, Baburao Patil, Narayan Tambat, Haribhau Lonare, and Vasant Shinde worked in Phalke’s studio in various capacities. They share their intimate experiences of working with Phalke in the process throwing light on the humane side of Phalke as well as his craft of film making. The oral history project of NFAI started back in 1983, where the interviews were recorded on audio cassettes only. Later, with the shift in technology, this project were converted into the Audio-Visual History project in 2008, where a film/video was recorded interspersed with clippings from related films and other visual material like photos, posters to illustrate the interview. These interviews were conducted by scholars as a part of this project in the 80s and 90s at the artist’s house. Bapu Watve, one of the artists from Prabhat Film Company and a film historian who conducted most of these interviews, historian and writer Randor Guy conducted many in-depth interviews in Tamil, Telugu and English. There are 26 interviews in Marathi, 10 in Tamil, 12 in English, three in Telugu and two in the Bengali language. The interview recordings are available on https://nfai.gov.in/audio_interview.php While the audio plays, the English translations of the interviews are made available on the side. Wherever possible, the relevant photographs of the artists and posters of the film they worked in are also added. “As most of the interviews are four decades old, we decided to digitize them. We also took the help of the sound department of FTII to enhance the voice quality of the interviews,” said Prakash Magdum. He added, “Since most of these interviews are in various Indian languages, they were translated into English so that film lovers across the world who are interested in Indian cinema can take benefit of it. We believe that when the 150th birth anniversary celebrations of Dadasaheb Phalke are coming to an end today, making this rich database available to film lovers would surely be a befitting tribute to the father of Indian cinema.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/8k-minutes-of-veteran-film-artiste-interviews-available-on-nfai-website-101619794261797.html

The books have been divided into age group categories and a parent just needs to give a call to respective volunteers and the books will be delivered at home free of cost. Under the Jai Ganesh platform, volunteers from 16 mandals have started providing this service from Friday. “Due to the lockdown, most of the children are spending time on smart phones and parents are also stuck since books stores are closed. So we decided to provide this service which will help children to stay connected with story books, general knowledge books and informative books about the nation’s history and current affairs,” said Piyush Shah, one of the volunteers. According to age group, books have been divided into story books and drawing books for ages three to six, history books of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj for ages seven to 11, India’s freedom stories including autobiographies of some of the great leaders for ages 11 to 14. “A parent only needs to send the age of their ward and accordingly we will deliver a set of books at their place.

30-04-2021||Lucknow||‘Over 700 staff on poll duty in UP lost battle to Covid-19’: Teachers’ body||Claiming that over 700 primary, upper primary school government teachers and other employees succumbed to Covid-19 after training and panchayat poll duty across the state since April 12, Uttar Pradeshiya Prathmik Shikshak Sangh has demanded that the counting of votes slated for May 2 should be deferred for now. The four-phase panchayat elections in the state were held between April 15 and April 29.In a letter to chief minister Yogi Adityanath and the state election commission (SEC) on April 29, teachers’ association president Dinesh Chandra Sharma mentioned the names of all teachers who died after they contracted the infection when called for training and election duty.Minister of state (independent charge) for basic education, Satish Chandra Dwivedi was quick to react and said, “There’s no specific audit done by basic education department about the number of teachers’ death. It is wrong to say all those who were engaged in election duty died due to Covid. How do we know that teachers were not infected when they came for election duty? And how does anyone know that teachers, after returning from the election duty, got infected for some other reasons? It is also beyond any justification that teachers contracted infection during poll duty and succumbed to it.”“Government teachers alone were not doing election duty. There were people from other departments too. We don’t have any data on how teachers got infected and I don’t know how teachers’ association leader has prepared that list of 700 teachers and staff who succumbed to Covid,” the minister added. He further said if Sharma had written a letter to chief minister Yogi Adityanath, it was up to the CM and the SEC to take a call on his demands.Sharma also claimed that in the last 2 to 3 weeks, he sent several letters to the chief minister and SEC to defer the election as several lives were lost. The teachers’ union leader said a maximum of 33 teachers died in Azamgarh district, 31 in Gorakhpur, 25 in Prayagraj and 20 each in Lucknow and Lakhimpur Kheri districts. He said many of these lives could have been saved had the SEC taken note of his April 12 letter in which he pointed out that Covid protocol was not being followed during training.The issue drew a lot of attention after Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra and Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav took to Twitter on Thursday demanding compensation of ₹50 lakh each for those who lost their lives in panchayat polls.On Friday, Dwivedi criticised Priyanka Gandhi Vadra for her tweet on the issue. “You have a habit of deleting tweets on many occasions when they turn out to be wrong. You have done dirty politics on the basis of incorrect figures to scare people,” the minister tweeted.In a string of tweets, Dwivedi said, “The global pandemic has engulfed the life of every section of the society. Both PM Narendra Modi and UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath are leaving no stone unturned in fighting out the pandemic. Like every section, teachers are very important to us. We are committed to their safety.” The minister said it would be better if Priyanka Gandhi Vadra worried about Congress-ruled states like Chhattisgarh and Maharashtra.Lucknow primary school teacher Ramesh Kumar Yadav, 28, was among those who died battling Covid-19. He was among the 69,000 teachers who had got the job when fresh recruitments of assistant teachers were made recently. The wait for the job had been a long over two years as the matter had reached court. “My brother passed away without getting his first salary,” said his eldest brother Suresh Kumar.Yadav was posted at primary school, Adampur, in Sultanpur in December last. As per his family, he contracted the infection during poll training and his condition worsened soon after election duty on April 19. Yadav had been eagerly looking forward to his first salary. He had plans to give a surprise gift to his wife, Nisha, who is inconsolable, as are his parents.On April 22, primary and secondary government teachers jointly carried out an online campaign on Twitter #PostponeUPElection to air their grievances against the panchayat polls, alleging that many of their fellow teachers contracted Covid infection during training and poll duty.With over 94K tweets, it was among the top trending hashtag as teachers from across the state participated in the campaign, urging the state government to call off the three-tier panchayat polls in Uttar Pradesh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/over-700-staff-on-poll-duty-in-up-lost-battle-to-covid-19-teachers-body-101619788548468.html

With ambulance charging more than regular rates, the civic body has decided to use private old school buses and Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Limited (PMPML) school buses.“With the surge in death rate, many people are not able to get hearse vans on time or have to wait for a long time. If they hire an ambulance service, they have to shell out more money. It is important for PMC to have other options,” said an officer from the health department on the request of anonymity.“The buses will be used either as ambulances or hearses, as per requirement. The drivers union have also supported the cause. Last year many were not willing to come voluntarily, but this time all have agreed,” said Sanjay Sasane, deputy regional transport officer.PMC will pay service charges to drivers and provide PPE kits.PMPML has already provided six “Pushpak Shavahinis” (hearses), which are taking bodies to crematoriums.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pmc-to-turn-ten-school-buses-into-hearses-101619786208331.html

At least eight months back, Sassoon had received 25 ventilators, and PMC had received 35 ventilators. The 34 ventilators are operational in PMC hospitals. Why can’t Sassoon use them? Mohol said.“I went to Sassoon and brought them under PMC’s custody. Our team has repaired them. Eight of them have already been dispatched to ASI hospital run by PMC in Bibwewadi,” he said.The ventilators from Sassoon are kept in a facility on the premises of Naidu Hospital.Officials of Sassoon hospital, however, have refuted claims about ventilators lying unused. Dr Muralidhar Tambe, dean of Sassoon Hospital, said, “We welcome the efforts taken by the mayor in getting the ventilators repaired. We have also repaired them multiple times. Because of the heavy load of patients, there were repeated breakdowns with those ventilators, so we have to repair them multiple times.”According to Dr Tambe, initially, service engineers were afraid to come to Sassoon because of the fear of contracting Covid. “The spare parts were not easily available. We had extra ventilators which we put to use. Due to the corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives, we had an adequate number of new high-end ventilators in the past year. Hence, there was never a shortage of ventilators in Sassoon hospital,” he said.Currently, there are 684 beds allocated in Sassoon hospital only for Covid patients. Out of which 521 are oxygenated beds, 22 are ICU beds without a ventilator, and 102 are ICU beds with ventilators.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pune-mayor-claims-25-ventilators-received-by-sassoon-under-pm-cares-fund-lying-unused-101619786028304.html

Healthcare will be able to manage with a lower positivity rate to decrease mortality,” a statement issued by the IMA state president Dr Vinayak Buvaji, said. The doctors have said such a move would decrease the tremendous workload on the already compromised health system to some extent at both private as well as government establishments. The IMA said that last year’s lockdown did not prove to be detrimental to normal living and was a “calculated” measure. At present, Goa has 20,898 active Covid-19 cases, while 1,146 people have died in the state after contracting the disease. The state has been recording more than 3,000 fresh cases each day for the last few days while more than two dozen people are succumbing to the disease daily. The Goa government announced a three-day lockdown over the weekend with an exception to all essentials services until Monday. Chief Minister Pramod Sawant has however ruled out extending the lockdown for now. “I want to assure the people of the state that there will definitely not be an extension in the lockdown for now,” Sawant told the media on Friday. Migrant workers had begun to leave the state en masse after the announcement of the lockdown fearing a repeat of last year in which the harsh lockdown and lack of transport to their hometowns left many stranded and hungry. On Thursday evening, Goa recorded 3,019 fresh Covid cases of the 5,910 tests conducted, throwing up a positivity rate of 51% - the highest the state has recorded till date. The state’s Covid-19 facilities have already run out of beds leaving patients having to wait several hours before beds are made available. Hospital wards are having to deal with more patients than they have the capacity for with patients having to sleep on stretchers and chairs. The Goa Medical College, the state’s premier medical institute has converted its examination hall into a covid ward to help accommodate additional 150 beds. “Even on this day, there are beds available. People should not panic. We are augmenting facilities and in the next four days, another 400 oxygen beds will be made available including an ICU with 150 beds,” CM Sawant said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/goa-chief-minister-says-no-to-lockdown-doctors-call-for-extension-of-curbs-101619784408212.html
30-04-2021||Delhi||Covid-19: Delhi nurses demand reserved beds for themselves, their families||Staff associations of several hospitals in the national Capital have demanded reserved beds for themselves and their family members, who test positive for Covid-19, as infections continue to multiply in Delhi.The All-India Government Nurses’ Federation on Thursday wrote to Ram Manohar Lohia (RML) hospital requesting the authorities to make a “firm policy” for admission of nurses and their family members, after the relatives of two nurses at the hospital died for the want of treatment.At least two nurses and a technician at Lok Nayak Hospital succumbed to the infection this week.According to the federation, over 250 nursing and technical staff members of RML Hospital have tested Covid-19 positive at their hospital in the past month. Similarly, the nursing staff at GTB Hospital said over 150 nurses and frontline workers have contracted Covid in the past few weeks.In a letter addressed to the RML Hospital medical superintendent Rana AK Singh, the federation on Thursday alleged that sick nurses and their immediate family members were being denied admissions.“You are requested to make a proper and firm policy for admission of nurses and their family members. Some separate space/floor should be allocated for this purpose. Their lives are also equally important to run the hospital in the future. We cannot afford to lose a single nurse in this battle with corona as there is already a shortage of nurses in the health care system. You are requested to look into the matter seriously and make necessary arrangements for nurses at the earliest,” GK Khurana, the secretary-general of the federation, said in his letter.Earlier on Tuesday, the Union ministry of health directed the three central government hospitals in Delhi - including RML and Safdarjung -- to ensure that health care workers who contract Covid-19 are provided immediate treatment.A member of the RML Nursing Union, who wished not to be named, said, “Although RML Hospital issued an order regarding prioritising staff’s treatment earlier, it has not been implemented yet. On Tuesday, a nurse, who is Covid positive, had to spend a night there to admit her mother who is also infected with the virus. She had to run from ward to ward looking for a bed for her mother, even as she herself grew weaker.”“The hospital should allot some separate space or floor for the staff members immediately,” she added.Despite repeated attempts, Singh did not respond to calls and texts sent for comment.On Wednesday, a nursing officer at GTB Hospital wrote to their medical superintendent raising the same concern. He alleged that an unwell nursing officer was not allowed to transfer to his ward despite a bed being available on Wednesday night and was asked to produce a letter from the chief medical officer (CMO). “We request you to prioritise health workers and their dependents for admission in our hospital... if health care workers are not allowed admissions, then why are we working as front-line warriors,” he said in the letter.Dr Anil Jain, the in-charge of all Covid-19 related management at GTB Hospital, did not respond to calls and texts seeking comment.Meanwhile, the Delhi government’s Lok Nayak hospital on Wednesday issued an order clarifying that hospital staff will be admitted at their facility and no permission from the administration was necessary. “It is again clarified that all employees, doctors, nursing staff, paramedical staff, and health care workers of Lok Nayak Hospital, including their parents, must be admitted without any permission from the hospital administration or CMO or CCMO,” said medical director Suresh Kumar in the order. At least three nurses at Lok Nayak have succumbed to the infection in the past three weeks, hospital officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/covid19-delhi-nurses-demand-reserved-beds-for-themselves-their-families-101619783929002.html

All legislators agreed to the chief minister’s suggestion to send a proposal to the BJP high command and the Election Commission to postpone the byelections. “We would request to relax the constitutional binding of holding the elections within six months regarding which the ECI is empowered to take a decision,” Thakur said. Lockdown should be last resort: MLAs The chief minister also sought views of BJP MLAs on the Covid-19 situation in the state. The MLAs were unanimous that a lockdown should be the last resort as it would hit the economy. However, they said, the government may decide in this regard if the situation doesn’t improve. The MLAs suggested better coordination between the government and the party to deal with the pandemic. Some legislators suggested that the government should take the representatives of Beopar Mandals into confidence and regulate timings and curbs in bazaars. “Legislators should help in providing relief, including essential items, to people. They should help transport patients to hospitals and spread awareness to prevent the spread,” he said.

Sikh preacher and Haryana Sikh Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (HSGPC) president Baljit Singh Daduwal, who played a key role in felicitating the former IPS officer, and representatives of Sikh organisations, including Shiromani Akali Dal (Amritsar), United Akali Dal (UAD), Shiromani Akali Dal (Democratic), Shiromani Akali Dal-Delhi (Sarna faction), Sikh Youth Federation (Bhindranwala) and some Nihang organisations gathered in the verandah in front of the main entrance of the holiest Sikh shrine, to do the honours despite Covid-19 restrictions that don’t allow more than 20 people to assemble. Also read: Why don’t you buy 100% of Covid-19 vaccines: SC’s 10 questions to CentreAddressing the gathering, Daduwal said, “Being a fearless police officer, Kunwar Vijay investigated the case with honesty and impartiality. Unfortunately, the Punjab and Haryana high court quashed the report, giving respite to the accused, including senior police officials. Though the Sikhs have been deprived of justice with the quashing of the probe, they are happy over the role played by Kunwar Vijay. We wanted to honour him by calling a big Panthic gathering but it was possible due to the surge in Covid-19 cases. This honour is on behalf of all Sikh organisations.” Expressing gratitude, Kunwar Vijay said, “I did my best to bring the culprits to justice and did not bother about my job as it was a matter of the Guru’s sacrilege.” He had led the Punjab government-constituted special investigation team (SIT) but opted for voluntary retirement on April 11, two days after the high court quashed his report, directing the state government to reconstitute a new SIT without him on board. Other Sikh organisation leaders also praised his role in their speeches. They attacked Shiromani Akali Dal patriarch Parkash Singh Badal and his son Sukhbir Singh Badal over the 2015 incidents. SAD (Democratic) leaders Bhai Mohkam Singh, Manjit Singh Bhoma, SAD(A) leader Jaskaran Singh Kahan Singh Wala, former MLA Ravinder Singh Brahmpura, UAD leader Gurdeep Singh Bathinda, Sikh Youth Federation Bhindranwala president Balwant Singh Gopala, Sarna group leader Harjot Singh Sandhu and former Golden Temple priest Bhai Balbir Singh, who denied Parkash Singh Badal a ‘siropa’ inside Golden Temple, were present on the occasion. Meanwhile, a group of Sikh activists also protested the honour of Kunwar Vijay, alleging that he had given the clean chit to police officers who played a role in the firing incidents.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hardline-sikh-leaders-felicitate-ex-ig-for-probe-into-2015-police-firing-cases-101619782908067.html

The court, which took the case suo motu, sent notices to the railways and state government, HT has learnt.According to officials, the 31-year-old woman boarded the Guruvayur-Punalur passenger train from Mulanthuruthy (Ernakulam district) on Wednesday morning. She told the police that in a hurry she boarded a coach which was completely empty. She suffered serious injuries jumping off the moving train to escape sexual assault and robbery. Some locals saw her jumping from the train and rushed her to the nearest hospital.“I dropped her at the railway station in the morning. She told us everything happened in just five minutes. Her condition is stable now,” said her husband, adding that she used to take the train regularly to travel to her workplace in Chengannur.The police have identified the assailant as Babu Kuttan, a serial offender who was released from jail a couple of months back. The woman told the police that shortly after she boarded the train a man came running and leapt into the compartment. While she was talking to her sister on her mobile phone, she noticed the man closing all doors of the compartment. She said the man came towards her, snatched her gold chain and threw her mobile phone out of the window.The woman said when she refused to part with her earrings and bangles, the assailant threatened her with a screwdriver and dragged her to the nearby bathroom. After the scuffle, she managed to open the door and tried to alight from the moving train. She said she clung to the door of the moving train for a while before losing the grip and fell on the tracks. She reportedly recognised the offender from the album of the history-sheeters. The latest incident has triggered outrage and raised questions on women safety in trains and other public transport systems. The state women commission has also registered a case. The railway protection force has registered a case under many sections of the Indian Penal Code, including Section 376 of the IPC (rape) and recovered her mobile phone later. The assailant escaped with her chain and wallet.Ten years ago, a similar incident took place on the Ernakulam-Shornur passenger train. A 23-year-old salesgirl, who was alone in the ladies compartment, was robbed and later raped by a vagabond named Govindachami. Thrown out of the moving train, the victim eventually succumbed to her injuries. Govindachami was sentenced to death by the trial court. The Supreme Court later commuted his sentence to life-term.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/kerala-hc-takes-up-matter-of-robbery-and-assault-on-female-train-passenger-101619781708121.html
30-04-2021||Pune||Meant for CSWs in Pune, Rs7.94 crore released by govt lands in different hands||PUNE Part of an amount of ₹7.94 crore, released by the Maharashtra government as financial aid to be paid to commercial sex workers (CSW) in Pune, because of the Covid-19 pandemic, has been misappropriated. At least some of the funds have gone to the bank accounts of women who are not CSWs living in Annabhau Sathe Nagar, Tarawade vasti, Mohammadwadi. Meanwhile, some CSWs in Pune have been waiting for the funds now for almost one year. What appears to be a major goof-up, or a scam, only came to light after women from the vasti who received the money came forward to return it, as they are not, not have ever been, CSWs. On April 29, Nitin Pawar, president, Hamal Panchayat Samiti and Akhil Bharatiya Bahujan Sena, along with the NGO Saheli and the National Network of Sex Workers presented a statement to the district collector informing him of the misuse of the funds. According to Pawar, the women from Tarawade vasti were made to sign a consent form by members of an “unknown NGO”. “Since most of the women are illiterate, and working as waste pickers and maids, they simply signed the consent forms, gave copies of their Aadhar cards and bank passbooks, and paid an additional ₹200 for the service,” said Pawar. “Nine women received ₹15,000 for three months. The women are angry and want to return the money to the government as they are not sex workers. We have helped them lodge a police complaint,” said Tejasvi Sevekari, director, Saheli. As per the state government, an amount of ₹7.94 crore has been transferred to 5,296 bank accounts allegedly belonging to commercial sex workers in Pune. “On April 28, 2021, the government deposited an amount of ₹7.94 crore in 5,296 bank accounts of commercial sex workers who have been rescued from the flesh trade and who lost their livelihood, and have families and children, amidst the Covid-19 crisi,” confirmed Ashwini Kamble, Women and Child welfare officer, Pune district. The state released the money based on a Supreme Court order, dated September 21, 2020, that victims of the flesh trade be compensated by the administration with assistance like provision of foodgrains and cash. The court ruled that no documentary proof must be taken from victims while delivering the welfare measures and sops. VM, a sex worker and community leader in Pune, said, “We have been waiting for this money for almost a year and this money was meant for us. This is fraud. There is no transparency in the way things are done by the government.” Pune district collector Rajesh Deshmukh had constituted a committee to provide financial assistance to CSWs, with a welfare officer designated as its secretary. The committee visited the red-light areas, interacted with bonafide NGOs working there and deposited Rs5,000 per month in the accounts of rescued victims, and an additional ₹2,500 in the accounts of those who had children and families.  ₹11.26 crore was made available from the CM’s relief fund from October to December 2020. Deshmukh said that he had issued immediate orders for the financial assistance which took place in two phases. Manisha Edke is one of the 20 women who returned the money to the government. “I work as a maid and I would rather have my hard-earned money than government giveaways. They were meant for those working in the sex trade. My husband read the news on his mobile phone and we realised that the Rs15000 that we got were wrongly given to us. I would rather live with dignity and earn my money than take free funds from the government.” The group of women met Upper District Magistrate Jayashree Katare and handed her a statement about the incident. “It does not seem to be appropriate for hardworking women who empathise with their sisters without prejudice. It is also a step towards our self-esteem to be named in the list of women doing this business. So we are returning this money. It should be accepted and the names of these women in the scheme should be reduced from the beneficiary scheme. This grant, which is being given without any verification, should be thoroughly investigated,” said Nitin Waghmare. He demanded strict punishment for the culprits as they also lodged a complaint at Wanowrie Police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/meant-for-csws-in-pune-rs7-94-crore-released-by-govt-lands-in-different-hands-101619780880456.html

The farmers, who did not observe the Covid-19 protocol of maintaining social distance or wearing masks, arrived in the city from different parts of the state and marched towards the chief minister’s residence. The heavy police deployment could not restrict the farmers as they broke barricades and blocked roads leading to Captain Amarinder Singh’s residence. Also read: Will treat action against social media Covid appeals as ‘contempt of court’: SCFour policemen were injured when the farmers broke the barricades near the local Officers’ Colony. The district police spokesperson said, “Members of the Delhi-Katra Expressway Sangharsh Committee led by Harmanpreet Singh Jeji, Jagjeet Singh Galoli and others provoked the protesters to break barricades and attack police personnel. They tried to run over their tractor- trolleys on police officials, seriously injuring four police personnel.” The four police personnel were identified as Randhir Singh, Bhola Singh, Jasveer Singh and Gurmeet Kaur .They were admitted at the local Government Rajindra Hospital.Superintendent of police, city, Varun Sharma said the police were managing the law and order situation. “It is too early to say about any action against the protesters. We will surely act according to the law once we control the situation,” he said. The protesters want the state government to immediately stop the land acquisition process till the Centre resolves the issue of the farm laws against which farmers have been protesting on Delhi borders. They also demanded that the government revise the rates for land acquisition so that farmers get lucrative offers for selling their land. Struggle for better compensation Ramesh Dalal, the president of the Bharat Bhumi Bachao Sangharsh Committee, also reached the spot and joined protest. Harmanpreet Singh Jeji, the coordinator of the Delhi-Katra Expressway Kisan Sangharsh Committee, said that the farmers have been protesting peacefully for the past five months, but the state government has not heeded to their demands. “The state government should stop playing in the hands of the Centre in acquiring land for the project,” he said. He said that the government had called the farmers for a meeting several times in which they were assured that the acquisition process will be stopped temporarily. “A discussion was also held on compensation, on which we were told that the competent authority will award handsome compensation per acre,” he said. The National Highway Authority of India had initially come up with a compensation of ₹9.67 lakh per acre, but later farmers were offered ₹18 lakh. However, after the state government implemented the multiplication factor for land acquisition, many farmers were offered ₹55 lakh More than 200 villages in Patiala, Sangrur, Amritsar, Jalandhar, Kapurthala, Gurdaspur and Pathankot have already passed a resolution not to give their land for the project. In January, aiming to break the deadlock over the issue, the state government notified the new multiplication factor (with which market value is to be multiplied) under the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, but the issue remains unresolved.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hundreds-of-farmers-take-out-tractor-march-choke-patiala-101619774867804.html

Forty-five members of this extended family gave their samples for Covid-19 testing, but each of them was given a false result, said the DCP.It began late this month when 44 members of this family got themselves tested by two technicians of this lab over a period of a few days. Some of them were given positive results, other negative, the DCP said, adding that the exact count of either results was yet to be ascertained.Also Read | Amid surge in Covid-19 cases, AAP MLA demands President’s rule in DelhiOne of the members of this family, Rishab Shukla, got a positive result on Monday. “But Shukla didn’t have any symptoms so he decided to get himself tested at another lab on Wednesday.

We immediately called the local police station in-charge for an investigation of what seemed to be a fake report issue”.“On police investigations requested by us, five of our employees were identified to be a party to this crime without the knowledge of the lab management or lab head,” said Kohli.“We are not just disappointed but disgusted by this act of malice for a few rupees putting the lives of patients at risk. We’re in full compliance with the investigating authorities and support any and every action taken against them,” he said.“All our reports have a QR code which can be easily used to check the authenticity of reports.

Addressing a digital press conference, Kejriwal said the Delhi government will formally announce a date of launch for the mega vaccination drive. He said as on Friday, Delhi has no doses to vaccinate those between 18 years and 44 years. “The vaccines have not reached us till now. We are in touch with the manufacturers and the first batch of 300,000 doses of Covishield vaccine is likely to arrive in a day or two. Hence, I request people not to throng vaccination centres. Once we receive the doses, I will formally announce the date of launch of the mega vaccination drive,” he said. The chief minister said that the Delhi government will procure 13.4 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines over the next three months. He said, of the 13.4 million doses, the Delhi government will procure 67,00,000 doses from Serum Institute of India, which manufactures Covishield, the mainstay of India’s vaccination programme. The other half (67,00,000) of the doses will be procured from Bharat Biotech, which manufactures Covaxin.

The chief minister once again urged everyone not to crowd vaccination centres from Friday. Senior government officials said neither government centres nor private centres are going to open vaccination for those between 18-44 from Saturday. SII is offering its doses at ₹150 for the Centre, ₹300 for state governments, and ₹600 for the private sector. Bharat Biotech is offering its vaccine for ₹150 per dose to the Centre, ₹400 to state governments, and ₹1,200 to private hospitals.Hospitals have been asked to return all remaining doses provided by the government — for the current vaccination drive meant for 45 and above — after Friday’s vaccination and purchase their own shots.However, private hospitals in Delhi said both vaccine manufacturers have given long waiting periods to facilities that tried to procure doses independently. The manufacturers have conveyed to these private hospitals that they would first meet the orders placed by state governments and then honour the orders placed by private hospitals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/vaccine-drive-for-18-not-to-start-in-delhi-from-may-1-kejriwal-101619766948175.html

The husband’s Covid-19 report said he was Covid-19 negative as the couple was under home quarantine while their son is undergoing treatment for the disease at a hospital.“The couple’s son, who works in Puri, is under treatment at a hospital there after testing Covid positive. After the son tested positive, the couple gave their samples at the local community health centre for testing. Though both of them had Covid-like symptoms, only the woman’s sample tested positive,” said Jyoti Prakash Panda, a local police officer. Panda quoted their neighbours saying the couple was under great stress since their son was hospitalised. “As per local villagers, the couple was depressed after one of them tested positive. In rural areas, Covid is still considered a stigma.”A 66-year-old Covid-19 patient’s body was earlier last week abandoned for over 20 hours after villagers refused to help the family with his cremation in Odisha’s Bargarh district.Odisha on Friday reported its all-time highest single-day Covid count of 8,681 cases. The active cases in the state have now surged to 61,698, which is 50% more than the number during last year’s peak of 39,184 on September 25.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/couple-found-hanging-after-wife-tests-covid-positive-in-odisha-s-nayagarh-101619765327149.html
30-04-2021||Delhi||‘Don’t queue up outside Covid-19 vaccination centres tomorrow, stock will arrive in 1-2 days’: Kejriwal||Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Friday urged people not to queue up outside Covid-19 vaccination centres in the national capital on Saturday when the third phase of the inoculation drive to cover all adults in the country is scheduled to start. "I request you to not queue up at the centres tomorrow. As soon as the vaccines come, we will make proper announcements. Only then people with appointments can start coming to the centres," Kejriwal said.Kejriwal said the Delhi government has not received the vaccines against the coronavirus disease yet. "We are in constant touch with the company. We are hopeful that the vaccines will reach by tomorrow or the day after. They have assured us that 300,000 doses of Covishield are coming to us first, tomorrow or the day after," he added.He said the Delhi government has requested both companies to make available 67 lakh doses each in next three months. "Delhi government is ready to make payments for it. People of Delhi will be given free vaccines. We are making all efforts to see that people of Delhi are vaccinated in the next three months," Kejriwal added.More than 24.5 million people have registered themselves on the Co-WIN digital platform ahead of the Phase-3 of the Covid-19 vaccination for those above 18 years that is set to start from May 1, according to the Union health ministry. While more than 13.7 million people registered themselves on April 28, more than 10.4 million registered by the end of April 29.The government on Monday made the announcement after Prime Minister Narendra Modi held a series of meetings over India's response to record daily surges in coronavirus disease cases. In the meetings, PM Modi stressed that vaccination was "the biggest weapon" in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic and urged doctors to encourage more and more patients to get vaccinated.All adults can get Covid shots and states can buy doses directly from vaccine-makers in the "liberalised and accelerated Phase 3 strategy of Covid-19 vaccination", the government said. India began inoculating people in January using two anti-Covid-19 vaccines - Serum Institute of India's Covishield developed by Oxford-AstraZeneca and Bharat Biotech's made-in-India Covaxin. So far, the government allowed vaccinations only for health workers, frontline workers and those above 45 years in a centrally-controlled process.Delhi reported 24,235 new Covid-19 cases and 395 deaths on Thursday with a positivity rate of 31.76%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/dont-queue-up-outside-covid-19-vaccination-centres-tomorrow-stock-will-arrive-in-1-2-days-kejriwal-101619764012691.html

30-04-2021||Delhi||Delhi may witness a partly cloudy sky today, says IMD||The National Capital is likely to witness a partly cloudy sky on Friday, as per the India Meteorological Department (IMD) forecast that has also predicted that the maximum temperature to remain around 40 degrees Celsius (°C), providing some respite to people from heat as the city sizzled at 42.1°C on Thursday.The Met department has predicted the minimum temperature to be 23°C, nearly the same as recorded on Thursday by the Safdarjung weather station, which is considered the official weather market for the city. According to the IMD, the minimum temperature on Thursday was 23.2°C, one notch below normal and the maximum temperature was 42.1°C – three degrees above the normal for this time of the year.Also Read | Severe weather warning for Maharashtra, heavy rain likely in areas bordering KarnatakaMeanwhile, Delhi’s air quality remained in the poor category on Friday morning. Data from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) showed that the hourly air quality index (AQI) at 7am stood at 282, which is at the higher-end of the poor category. On Thursday, the average 24-hour AQI was 296, close to very poor category.An AQI between zero and 50 is considered good, 51 and 100 satisfactory, 101 and 200 moderate, 201 and 300 poor, 301 and 400 very poor, and 401 and 500 severe.On Friday, the Union ministry of earth science’s air quality monitoring centre, System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar) said, “The overall Delhi air quality is in the very poor category. Surface winds are moderate and south-southwesterly. Satellite fire data indicates effective fire counts have increased and touching 1,300 -- mainly wheat crop burning in Northern parts of India. Model trajectory and transport level wind directions are favourable for fire-related intrusion leading to deterioration of air quality in Delhi. Safar forecast that dust emissions from the dry arid region of Rajasthan are likely on April 30. Hence, AQI is likely to stay in the very poor to poor category for the next two days where external transport would be the dominating factor from two fronts. A marginal improvement in AQI is expecting by May 2.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/not-much-change-in-delhi-temperatures-todayimd-101619752487108.html
30-04-2021||Delhi||Govt to keep 20 MT oxygen as ‘buffer stock’ for emergency use||With the high demand and erratic supply of oxygen in the city, the Delhi government has decided to maintain a buffer stock of nearly 20 metric tonnes (MT) to help hospitals in distress, according to an order implementing a new oxygen quota for Delhi hospitals that came into force on Thursday midnight.“A reserve of 20MT on rotational basis will be maintained by the Govt of NCT of Delhi through the control centre to address emergent or critical situation at any hospital,” the order by a deputy secretary (health) read. This was one of the suggestions made by representatives of private hospitals in a meeting with deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia and representatives of oxygen suppliers on Monday.The order, which supersedes an April 26 order, says the total allocation of oxygen to hospitals treating patients with coronavirus disease (Covid-19) has been reduced marginally to provide oxygen for reserve, for non-Covid-19 services in hospitals, and because the oxygen suppliers are “realistically” providing less oxygen than the city’s quota.Of the daily quota of 490 MT medical oxygen allocated to Delhi by the Centre, suppliers said they could provide only 445 MT. Of this, 387 MT has been allocated to hospitals for Covid-19 services, 40 MT for non-Covid services, and 18 MT as reserve. As per the previous order, Covid-19 hospitals in Delhi needed 454 MT of medical oxygen. The entire supply was to be divided among them.“The quota for oxygen has been reduced; the allocation is based on the patient census in the hospital on April 24 — I had 240 Covid-19 patients in the hospital then, today I have 302. Where will I get the oxygen to manage the additional 60 patients,” said Dr SCL Gupta, medical director, Batra hospital.Dr Narin Sehgal, medical director of Sehgal Neo hospital, said, “My oxygen allocation was reduced from 1.5 MT to 1.1 MT in the revised order; I don’t know why. To be fair, however, I haven’t been calculating how much we have got against the quota but whatever we are getting isn’t enough. I am not blaming anyone. The situation is unprecedented.”The calculation for oxygen requirement is based on non-ICU patients needing 10 litres of oxygen per minute and those in the ICU needing 24 litres per minute.The Delhi government said it doesn’t even receive the entire 445 MT of oxygen on a daily basis. “We received 402 metric tonne of oxygen yesterday, and the day before that 408 metric tonne. We have been allocated the share of 480 metric ton on April 21st and 490 metric ton on April 25th, but it is hardly reaching us in that quantity. Presently, the allocation is done keeping in mind the number of ICU beds and non-ICU oxygen beds,” the government said in a statement.Meanwhile the Delhi government told the high court on Thursday that two more pressure swing absorption (PSA) oxygen generation plants will be operational in the city from Friday, adding that it needed nearly 1,000 MT of oxygen to augment intensive care unit beds needed to handle the rush of critical Covid patients.Delhi government counsel Rahul Mehtra made the submission before a high court bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Rekha Palli while giving a status report on the Centre’s plan to set up PSA oxygen units at different Delhi hospitals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/govt-to-keep-20-mt-oxygen-as-buffer-stock-for-emergency-use-101619736418582.html
30-04-2021||Delhi||‘Why are some states getting more O2 than they need, while Delhi gets less?’ Delhi HC asks Centre to respond||The Delhi high court on Thursday questioned the Centre for allocating more medical oxygen then asked for to certain states while not providing the quantity being sought by Delhi, which is facing acute shortage.“We are not saying that people in the other parts of the country should die. But if the demand of a particular state is ‘x’, then why did you give it ‘x+y’? Why don’t you give ‘y’ to Delhi?” a bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Rekha Palli asked the Centre, represented by Solicitor General Tushar Mehta.The Centre has allocated 490 MT medical oxygen to Delhi, which has been demanding 700 MT.With cases in the Capital rising, and most hospitals not adding beds or intensive car units because they do not have access to adequate oxygen, the Delhi government , separately, on Thursday urged the Central government to raise the national capital’s daily quota of medical oxygen from 490 MT to 976 MT and provide logistics support for the enhanced allocation.Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia, who is also Delhi’s nodal minister for Covid-19, wrote to Union minister Piyush Goyal on Thursday stating that the national capital will require more medical oxygen as the government plans to add around 15,000 beds in the next 10 days.“The people and the Government of NCT of Delhi will be extremely grateful to the Government of India if it can kindly increase the allocation from the present 490 MT per day to 976 MT per day, preferably from nearby oxygen plants, reducing the turnaround time,” Sisodia wrote to Goyal, who is also the minister of commerce and industry and the minister of consumer affairs. He is also the railway ministerOn Thursday, the high court rejected the submission of Mehta that the present oxygen supply to Delhi was sufficient, and asked the Centre to respond on why other states were getting more oxygen or almost as much as they demanded.The bench clarified that it was by no means interested in securing more oxygen for Delhi than required, and that too at the cost of any state or Union territory.“We make it clear that by no means are we interested in securing for Delhi more than what’s required, and that too at a cost of any other state or Union territory. However, if submissions of Delhi or amicus were to be accepted, it would appear the central government needs to explain this, for which we are granting time. It goes without saying the aforesaid reflect arguments advanced by amicus and (lawyer Rahul Mehra) Delhi,” the court noted in its order.The question was posed after senior advocates Rajshekhar Rao, amicus curiae in the matter, and Mehra, appearing for the Delhi government, told the court that as per the national allocation plan, Maharashtra demanded 1500 metric tonne (MT) of oxygen per day and was allocated 1661 MT; similarly, Madhya Pradesh demanded 445 MT and it was allocated 543 MT, and that the situation was similar for several other states.The discussion on the national allocation plan came about after Mehra told the court that Delhi’s demand of 700 MT is not being granted . He told the bench that the city was working to augment its bed capacity and would add 15,000 more beds to meet the surge in the cases in mid May predicted by experts; however, they do not have sufficient oxygen.“I will place it now and my instructions are from the top of the bureaucracy. They (Centre) are skirting the oxygen supply (issue). As a state government we are being put in the dock but the Centre has miserably failed the people of the country... Some responsibility should be fixed. Only paper orders have been passed. This is not oxygen in air, it’s oxygen in cylinders. Except giving sermons, the Centre has not done anything. There is complete apathy for the people of Delhi. We cannot be mute spectators just because they are the Centre,” Mehra argued.Solicitor General Mehta, justifying the allocation plan, said the Centre is making all possible efforts to augment the supply and claimed the current supply is sufficient to meet current needs. He said that oxygen has not reached Delhi because the Union territory has been facing difficulty in picking the allocated amount to them.He said that the national allocation plan should not be touched by the court because several factors have been taken into consideration while deciding. He also justified that Maharashtra has been given more oxygen because of the raging pandemic, while Madhya Pradesh’s population is three times that of the Capital..Maharashtra had 675,451 active cases as on Wednesday night, but Madhya Pradesh only 92,773, and Delhi over 100,000.“Suppose there is a huge, unprecedented surge tomorrow, which nobody can anticipate… I do not want to create panic… then the situation would be different. The Delhi government did demand 700 MT. For me, a Delhi citizen is as dear and important as a Kerala citizen. They did demand 700. Allocation is 480-490, the actual quantity coming to Delhi 335-340 which according to our assessment is sufficient,” Mehta submitted before the court.“Delhi is facing difficulty because it has not been able to pick up the allocated amount.. 90% of our time is going out firefighting for Delhi. There are transport and logistical issues,” he said. “No resources are unlimited and we are augmenting. There can be lapses but those could be rectified.”During the hearing, an agitated Mehta told a senior officer of the Centre, “You cut from MP and give it to Delhi. It would be at the cost of some lives in MP but let us do it for Delhi.”However, the bench objected to this and said, “Don’t give an impression as if we are asking something extra for Delhi. We don’t appreciate this. We are asking this on the basis of facts and figures. You can’t be emotional about it. You have to take this head on, you can’t duck it.”SG Mehta said that the Centre will file an affidavit on the court’s query and will give the reasons for giving more oxygen to Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra.“There are states which received less than what they had asked for. We have been rationalizing,” he said adding that hysteria should not be created and the situation is dynamic”. Earlier this week, Mehta said in court that Delhi was behaving like a “crybaby”.To this, the bench said the panic is because of lack of resources.“It’s not because of what judges or lawyers say; panic is on the ground. People are suffering but hospitals are not taking patients. We already had loss of lives in Delhi due to shortage of oxygen. It has fallen on you to resolve this. How you resolve is your problem,” the court said.The court was hearing a plea by lawyer-petitioner Rakesh Malhotra, who along with several hospitals sought directions to the Centre and the Delhi government for better facilities and continuous supply of oxygen in the hospitals and nursing homes of the city.In his letter to Goyal, Sisodia said Delhi has been witnessing around 25,000 fresh COVID cases a day and about 10% of the patients require some form of hospitalisation, including oxygen support.Sisodia said that merely increasing oxygen allocation to Delhi will not do and that the Central government will also have to arrange transportation to bring the same to the national Capital. “It is also our humble request to provide transport infrastructure, including railways and tankers, for the additional allocation since Delhi is a non-industrial state and accordingly, does not have its own infrastructure,” he said. .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/why-are-some-states-getting-more-o2-than-they-need-while-delhi-gets-less-delhi-hc-asks-centre-to-respond-101619736148014.html
30-04-2021||Delhi||Fatalities hit yet another high as 395 die of Covid-19||The daily Covid-19 death toll in the Capital hit another high, with 395 more people dying of the infection on Thursday, as the fourth wave of the pandemic continues to sweep across the city with no respite in sight.The city has added over 300 deaths a day for eight days in a row. Delhi has also logged 2,579 deaths of the infection in the past seven days alone.So far, 15,772 people in the city have died of the viral infection since the first death was reported in March last year. The number of deaths reported each day has shot up from an average of 15 during the first week of April to 368 a day over the last seven days.Delhi also added 24,235 infections, Thursday’s health bulletin showed, as the Capital logged more than 20,000 new cases for the 12th straight day. The city has added over 459,000 infections so far in April alone.In comparison, Delhi added just over 382,000 cases between October 2020 and March this year.The positivity rate – proportion of samples that test positive – stood at 32.8% on Thursday, which means that around one in three people who get tested in the city are infected.“The fact that the positivity rate has been declining is a certain ray of hope for us. The highest was recorded at nearly 35% about four days back. We thought it might go beyond 40 and 45%. But it has halted at 35%, and is even dropping, like yesterday [Wednesday], when it was 31.76%,” Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain said in a press briefing on Thursday.The drop, however, has been marginal at best.Lok Nayak, GTB to start makeshift facilitiesMeanwhile, to accommodate more Covid-19 patients in health care facilities, the government ordered Lok Nayak and Guru Teg Bahadur hospitals to make arrangements for consumables and more staff, so that they can start setting up makeshift facilities.“What we are seeing is a result of lack of planning. The second wave was not anticipated. When it started, it was time to make a quick assessment. We should have expected the worst... We don’t have enough oxygen manufacturing facilities. In India we have 50 beds for every 100,000 people, which is among the lowest [in the world]. In terms of bed strength, we are ranked 155 out of 167 globally, as per a United Nations report. This puts us in company with the poorest of the poor. Delhi has 20 million people and even better prepared states like Kerala and Tamil Nadu are struggling,” said Dr Lalit Kant, a scientist and former head of epidemiology and communicable diseases at the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/fatalities-hit-yet-another-high-as-395-die-of-covid19-101619735782220.html
30-04-2021||Delhi||Short of doses, Delhi to keep expanded jabs drive on hold||The Capital is unlikely to start the third phase of Covid-19 vaccination from Saturday because the state government hasn’t received its first order of jabs and private hospitals may get consignments weeks later, even as chief minister Arvind Kejriwal announced that Delhi will expand inoculation centres and finish immunising everyone in three months.Of the 13.4 million doses needed by the Capital, Delhi will get the first batch of 300,000 shots only by May 3 from Serum Institute of India (SII), which manufactures Covishield, the mainstay of India’s vaccination programme, senior officials aware of developments said.“We don’t have enough vaccines. We have requested for procurement of vaccines from the respective companies. Despite all preparations being made, availability of vaccines is a must for the inoculation to begin,” said Delhi health minister Satyender Jain.Last week, the Centre opened the immunisation drive to all adults and allowed states and private hospitals to procure directly from vaccine manufacturers. Experts said that quickly vaccinating all adults was crucial to fighting the devastating surge of infections.Registration for this phase began on Wednesday, but Delhi, like many states, signalled that vaccines may not be immediately available due to shortage of stocks and delay in deliveries.“We haven’t received the schedule from companies yet, which includes how many vials will reach on which dates,” Jain said. Delhi will administer the jabs free of cost.Delhi government divided the order for 13.4 million doses into three consignments — 300,000, 5,000,000 and 8,100,000 . So far, only the first batch has been ordered and the second is in the process of being ordered. As of now, both the orders are being prepared for SII, an official said.The situation, though, is hardly unique to the Capital. Doses required for adults below 45 are to be acquired directly by the state governments and private hospitals — which can buy up to 50% of a vaccine manufacturer’s stock — but this is yet to happen.Officials across states told HT that the doses would not be available by May 1, as did representatives of private hospitals. Only three of 16 state governments contacted by HT on Tuesday said they expected at least some doses to start arriving by the end of the first week of May. Most others said they expected deliveries only after mid-May.But Delhi’s chief minister expressed confidence that the government will be able to get the job done in three months.“Had a meeting with the officials on vaccination drive in Delhi. Prepared a plan to vaccinate all above 18 years in the next 3 months. We will set up vaccination centres on a large scale. All eligible people must come forward to get vaccinated,” Kejriwal said in a tweet.There were back-to-back meetings on the issue on Thursday. Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal asked the chief secretary to urgently submit a report on the preparedness for the roll-out of the vaccination programme for those 18 years and above and Kejriwal held a meeting to review arrangements made for opening more centres and having enough medical teams.With Centre, state governments, and private hospitals placing orders separately, the companies have announced multiple price bands.SII is offering its doses at ₹150 for the Centre, ₹300 for state governments, and ₹600 for the private sector. Bharat Biotech is offering its vaccine for ₹150 per dose to the Centre, ₹400 to state governments, and ₹1,200 to private hospitals.Hospitals have been asked to return all remaining doses provided by the government — for the current vaccination drive meant for 45 and above — after Friday’s vaccination and purchase their own shots.However, private hospitals in Delhi said both vaccine manufacturers have given long waiting periods to facilities that tried to procure doses independently.Sir Ganga Ram hospital said its order was refused by SII while Bharat Biotech said it will revert.“We have been receiving Covishield from the government and so we approached SII first. However, they said that they do not have the capacity to provide doses at the moment. Then, we placed an order for 51 lakh doses of Covaxin but they have also said they will get back to us. Both companies have to fulfil orders for the government first,” said Dr DS Rana, the hospital chairman.The hospital has doses that will last only till Friday and all leftover doses have to be given back to the central government.“If we do not have the vaccines, we cannot run a vaccination centre,” said Dr Rana.A doctor from the private Hamdard Institute of Medical Science hospital and medical college tweeted a response from SII that said the hospital had to wait for six months for the doses.“Due to the current obligation to meet the government’s existing requirements and to meet the additional demand emanating from state governments under liberated and accelerated vaccination, it is challenging to meet independently the requirement across from large number of Private hospitals. Therefore, we urge you to access the vaccine when it becomes available in the private market supply chain channels, which will take about five – six months from now,” the tweet read.Dr Anoop Mishra, chairman of Fortis Centre for Diabetes, Obesity and Cholesterol said, “Companies have to give 50% of the vaccines doses to the Centre and are therefore unsure when they can give it to the private sector. So, we will have to halt the vaccination drive after April 30.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/short-of-doses-delhi-to-keep-expanded-jabs-drive-on-hold-101619735553374.html
30-04-2021||Delhi||Police to create dedicated lane for emergency vehicles, hearse vans||To facilitate the speedier movement of oxygen tankers and emergency vehicles such as ambulances, hearse vans and those carrying oxygen cylinders within the city, as well as those coming from neighbouring states, the Delhi Police on Thursday asked all police stations to create dedicated lanes on roads, near police checkpoints.The directions were issued by the city police chief SN Shrivastava who also used his official Twitter handle to post the update and explain why the step was taken. These dedicated lanes are being created only near major vehicle checkpoints set up by police to verify motorists and prosecute those found violating the ongoing curfew (lockdown) orders.“All police stations in Delhi have been directed to dedicate a lane, on the extreme left of the road, for ambulances and other emergency vehicles, including oxygen tankers and those carrying cylinders (in emergency). This is being done to facilitate their smooth movement, even as lockdown violators are prosecuted on the (remaining) regular lanes,” Shrivastava, who also tweeted about the step along with an image of the dedicated lane around 2.30pm on Thursday.According to the Delhi Disaster Management Authority’s (DDMA’s) curfew guidelines, only exempted vehicles or those having valid movement e-passes are allowed to ply on Delhi roads. The new arrangement is in addition to the green corridor that the police are providing to oxygen tankers coming from other states or via airports.A senior police officer privy to the development said, on condition of anonymity, that the police chief’s direction came after he made a field visit on Wednesday, during which he saw firsthand the jams at several police checkpoints as motorists were stopped by police personnel to check their movement passes.Shrivastava and other officers observed that such jams may also be delaying the movement of emergency vehicles and oxygen tankers.“The chief later issued directions to all police stations in Delhi for creating a separate lane on the left side of the road near each checkpoint for such emergency vehicles and those that carry oxygen,” the officer said.Deputy commissioner of police (south-west) Ingit Pratap Singh said the personnel deployed at checkpoints have been asked to put up large visible signage, demarking the dedicated lane, so that drivers of emergency vehicles and oxygen carrying vehicles can see them from a distance and accordingly move their vehicles into the dedicated lane.“The personnel present there will also signal the drivers to use the dedicated lanes to avoid any congestion at the picket,” said DCP Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/police-to-create-dedicated-lane-for-emergency-vehicles-hearse-vans-101619735118178.html
30-04-2021||Delhi||After 4 die of Covid-19, Tihar asks govt to allow release of inmates on parole||New Delhi: The death of four prisoners due to Covid-19 in the past three days has prompted Tihar Jail authorities to write to the Delhi government, requesting them to release some prisoners under “emergency parole” as one of the immediate measures to decongest the prison.While two prisoners died of the viral infection on Tuesday, two more succumbed to the disease on Thursday. HT had reported that with over 20,000 inmates currently lodged there, Tihar is at its most congested ever. It is almost double the official capacity of the prison, which has made social distancing and isolation a major problem.Delhi government officers, who wished not to be named, said they have received the jail’s proposal and were looking at different solutions to decongest the prison complex.Until April 6, the jail had only 19 infected prisoners. At that time, not a single jail staff had the disease. Currently, there are at least 261 Covid-19 positive inmates and 115 infected jail officers, underlining how fast the infection has spread throughout the jail in just 23 days.The Delhi high court also heard a petition on the issue on Wednesday and sought the response of the Centre, the Delhi government and the prison authorities. The petitioner demanded parole for prisoners involved in non-heinous crimes from three jails in the city in view of the unprecedented surge in Covid-19 cases.A bench of chief justice DN Patel and justice Jasmeet Singh issued a notice to the ministries of law and health, the Delhi government, police, office of the Lieutenant Governor and the director general of prisons, seeking their stand on the petition by May 4.The two prisoners, who died on Thursday, were admitted at the GTB hospital. One of them Kamaljeet, 75, an inmate of jail 3 was admitted to GTB on April 21. The second, Kehkashan, 41, was admitted to the hospital on April 22.On Tuesday night, prisoner Mukesh Talwar, 61, had succumbed to the disease. Talwar, who was arrested in a rape case last month, was lodged in jail 7 and had tested positive on April 22. Hours before Talwar’s death, a 43-year-old prisoner Mohammed Anis, who was lodged in jail number 4, too had died of the disease at the DDU hospital.Last year, nearly 6,000 prisoners were released on special parole and bail to decongest the jail when the pandemic spread in March. They were directed to later on dates decided by a high-powered committee of the high court, which included members of the state government, courts and prison.With cases declining after the third wave of the infection in October-November, the Delhi high court in December ordered the prisoners to surrender in a phased manner between February and March.Until February, the prison population was less than 13,000. However, with over 6,000 inmates back in jail, the total number of inmates went beyond 20500, twice the jail’s capacity of 10026. Officials said it is the highest population of inmates in the jail till date.A mid-level prison officer, who did not wish to be named, said, “ The government should act fast and decide. During the first, second and third wave, the cases were under control in our jails. Two persons died in June and July, last year. In February, there was a time, when there was not a single case. It is scary today. Even prisoners, like Rajan(Chhota Rajan) who were in isolation have tested positive. Four inmates have died in three days.”Among the famous prisoners who are currently Covid-19 positive are underworld gangster Chhota Rajan and former politician turned gangster Mohammed Shahabuddin. While Rajan has been admitted to AIIMS, Shahabuddin is under treatment at the DDU hospital. Student activist Umar Khalid, arrested for his alleged role in the Delhi riots, too, is in isolation after testing positive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/after-4-die-of-covid-19-tihar-asks-govt-to-allow-release-of-inmates-on-parole-101619734794079.html
30-04-2021||Delhi||Two in Delhi arrested for selling fire extinguishers as oxygen cylinders||Two men in west Delhi’s Dwarka were arrested for passing off fire extinguishers as oxygen cylinders and selling them to people, whose relatives have contracted Covid-19, said Delhi Police on Thursday.In one of the cheating cases, the patient for whom the equipment was procured died of Covid-19, read the complaint lodged by the victim’s acquaintance.Police could not immediately ascertain if the alleged cheating, or a possible delay in providing relief to the patient, had any direct bearing on the death. However, a relative of Narender, the 32-year-old patient who died, alleged that the delay in getting an oxygen cylinder led to his demise. “Had we not been cheated, my brother-in-law could have survived,” said the relative.Police said suspects Ashutosh Chauhan and Ayush were rendered jobless during the pandemic and passed off fire extinguishers as oxygen cylinders to make a quick buck. “They sold one such empty cylinder for ₹10,000,” said Santosh Meena, deputy commissioner of police (Dwarka).Geeta Arora, a resident of Bindapur in West Delhi, was looking for an oxygen cylinder for her friend’s relative, who lived in Noida. “The relative, a patient of Covid-19, had breathing issues and low oxygen levels. Her family was unable to find her a hospital bed,” said Meena.After reaching out to many people for a cylinder, Arora finally got in touch with Chauhan and Ayush, who asked her to visit near Uttam Nagar metro station to collect the cylinder on Monday night.A red coloured cylinder was handed over to Arora in lieu of a payment of ₹10,000. The same night, Arora handed over the cylinder to the patient’s family in Noida.The cheating came to the fore when the patient’s family went to get the cylinder filled on Tuesday morning and realized that it was a fire extinguisher. When Arora asked the suspects to return the money, they refused.On Wednesday, Arora learnt that the patient, for whom the cylinder was purchased passed away, read her statement to the police.She again pursued the suspects. They allegedly called her near the metro station, but didn’t meet her, despite making her run around for two hours. She finally decided to lodge a complaint, based on which a case of cheating and criminal conspiracy was registered at Uttam Nagar police station.The DCP said technical surveillance and local enquiry facilitated the arrest of the suspects, from whom they recovered four fire extinguishers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/two-in-delhi-arrested-for-selling-fire-extinguishers-as-oxygen-cylinders-101619734417980.html
30-04-2021||Delhi||Traders’ body writes to L-G, wants lockdown till May 15||The Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) has written to the Delhi lieutenant governor (L-G) Anil Baijal, demanding extension of lockdown in the national capital till May 15. Delhi is already under a lockdown till May 3, with only essential services and government offices allowed to function.Praveen Khandelwal, secretary general of CAIT, said, “Traders will be the worst affected due to extension of the lockdown, but the situation in Delhi is such that there is no other option. If lockdown is not extended after May 3, it will be difficult to break the chain. We have requested the L-G to extend the lockdown till May 15.”However, some other trader associations said the government should only extend the restrictions for a week, and ensure stricter enforcement of curbs.They said the curbs should be reviewed each week. They said if the lockdown was extended immediately till May 15, it will not only lead to losses for them but trigger panic among the migrant workers employed by them.Atul Bhargava, president of New Delhi Traders Association said: “The situation is such that extension of the lockdown is the need of the hour. But it should be done for a week and then reviewed. There should be strict enforcement of the lockdown norms. Even when markets open, there is a need to ensure that there is strict enforcement.”The Lajpat Nagar market association said traders were largely of the view that the lockdown should be extended for a week. Sanjay Bhargava, president of Chandni Chowk Sarv Vyapar mandal said, “Delhi is still reporting 20,000-plus cases daily. The positivity rate has not come down. The present situation is not conducive to reopen markets. Most traders feel that it should be extended, but we will take a final call this weekend.”Brijesh Goyal, chairman of Chamber of Trade and Industry and convener of AAP’s traders’ wing, said,“Let the Delhi government take a call on it. We have been talking to traders and a large number of them are in favour of extending the lockdown. But if it is extended for 15 days at one go, it will result in panic among migrant workers who are employed in markets.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/traders-body-writes-to-l-g-wants-lockdown-till-may-15-101619734001247.html

Wednesday (April 28) was the hottest day of the year so far with the maximum temperature reaching 42.2 degrees.On Thursday, the Safdarjung weather station, which is considered the official weather marker for the city, registered 42.1 degrees Celsius, three degrees above what is considered normal for this time of the year. The minimum temperature was 23.2°C.“After the light spell of rain on Saturday, there is another forecast of moderate to heavy rainfall on May 4 and May 5,” said an IMD official.In some parts of the city, the mercury nearly touched the 45 degree-mark on Thursday.

In 2019, the city registered 42.1 degrees Celsius.“From Saturday, there is a forecast of light rain accompanied by thunder and lightning. Temperatures are likely to start falling from Sunday. Next week, the maximum temperature is likely to hover around 37-38 degrees Celsius,” said another senior IMD official.Rain and thunderstorms have also been predicted for parts of Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, and Rajasthan.“Heatwave conditions will persist only for a couple of days. It will be followed by intense thunderstorm activity. Bihar, Odisha, parts of West Bengal and the entire northeast India is likely to witness severe weather. Due to this intense easterly activity, there may be clouding and some thunderstorm activity over northwest India. In Delhi, the rainfall activity might be very intense,” said R K Jenamani, senior scientist, national weather forecasting centre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/city-sizzles-at-42-1-c-light-rain-this-weekend-may-bring-mercury-down-101619733714790.html
30-04-2021||Delhi||Shanty fire kills couple, their four children in Delhi’s Bijwasan||A couple and their four children, including a toddler, were charred to death in a shanty that caught fire in south-west Delhi’s Bijwasan late on Wednesday night, police said.The victims appeared to be asleep when the fire broke out. It caused a cooking gas cylinder to burst, and the blaze spread to two other adjacent huts. The occupants of those shanties managed to escape in the nick of time, police said. The cause of the fire is yet to be ascertained, police said, but said it appeared to be an accident.Ingit Pratap Singh, deputy commissioner of police (south-west), identified the couple as Kamlesh Kumar Singh, 37, and his wife Budhni (32). They lived in the hut in an agricultural field with their four children -- two daughters, 16 and 12, and two sons, six and three months old.The family, along with three others from the same village in Bihar’s Muzaffarpur district, lived in four huts in an agricultural field next to Valmiki Colony in Bijwasan. They cultivated fields they took on rent.“We all went to sleep around 10.30pm on Wednesday. Around midnight, I heard people screaming. I came out of my shanty, and found the hut next door on fire. At that moment, there was a cylinder blast that also set my hut on fire,” said Nawal Mahto, a neighbour.Mahto managed to evacuate the four members of his family, when his hut, and a third one that was unoccupied for the past fortnight, were burnt to ashes. “We had no time to salvage our belongings,” he said.The hut where the victims died was the first to be affected suffered the most damage. “Our huts are made of wood, plastic, and straw. That caused the fire to spread fast. It appears that Kamleshwar and his family could not open the metal chain they used to lock the door of the shanty,” said Nathuni Mahto, whose hut was the only one unaffected by the blaze.The position in which the charred bodies were found suggested that none of the six victims could make it even to the door of their hut. “The bodies of Singh and his older son were found next to their bed. The bodies of Budhni, her two daughters and younger son were found on a cot on which they usually slept,” said the DCP.Several half-burnt books were among the few identifiable items inside the hut. Neighbours said that Singh was keen his children got a proper education, and had enrolled three of them in a government school.Atul Garg, director, Delhi Fire Services, said four fire tenders were rushed to the spot after they got a call at 12.30am.Singh’s elderly parents live in Muzaffarapur. “He sent some money to his parents every few months. Now, they’ll have to fend for themselves,” said Nawal Mahto.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/shanty-fire-kills-couple-their-four-children-in-delhi-s-bijwasan-101619733371931.html
30-04-2021||Jaipur||Rajasthan HC seeks reply from centre, state over Covid-19 vaccine pricing||The Rajasthan High Court has sought responses from the central and state governments and vaccine manufacturers Serum Institute of India and Bharat Biotech on a petition challenging differential pricing of the vaccine for the Centre and the state, saying such pricing would hamper national vaccination strategy.A division bench of Justice Sabina and Justice MK Vyas passed the order while hearing a public interest litigation filed by Mukesh Sharma.The petition questioned the difference in pricing for the Centre and the states. Both vaccine makers sold their doses to the Centre at ₹150 a shot. Subsequently, in Phase 3, where states have to procure vaccines from the makers, the companies announced a price of ₹400 per dose for states (Covishield; Serum Institute) and ₹600 a dose (Covaxin; Bharat Biotech). On Wednesday, SII reduced this to ₹300 a dose and on Thursday, Bharat Biotech, ₹400 a dose.The petitioner said the prices quoted by manufacturers are not just higher but extremely discriminatory and arbitrary. Rajasthan’s chief minister Ashok Gehlot has last week announced that the state Government shall bear the cost of vaccination of all those above the age of 18 years. Most other states have made similar announcements.The court has set May 12 as the next date of hearing.In another case, the Rajasthan High Court has issued notices to the Centre and the state government on alleged discrimination in the supply of medical oxygen and lifesaving injections to the state. The court will hear that matter on Friday.A division bench of Chief Justice Inderjit Mohanty and Justice Inderjit Singh, heard the petition filed by Advocate Poonam Chand Bhandari, and asked the Centre and the state to respond.“As compared to the other states, the supply of oxygen support system, liquid oxygen and lifesaving injections such as, Remdesivir for treatment of COVID-19 has been much less in Rajasthan.The requirement of liquid oxygen is 220 metric tonnes per day, however, the allocation by the Central Government is 205 metric tonnes per day. There is a short supply of Remdesivir injections also..,” claimed Bhandari’s petition..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/rajasthan-hc-seeks-reply-from-centre-state-over-covid-19-vaccine-pricing-101619731665528.html

Serum Institute of India and Bharat Biotech have been given orders of 50 lakh vaccine doses each,” Adityanath said in a statement.The state has already announced that it will administer the shots free of cost. Last week, Maharashtra had also announced that it would float a global tender for vaccines.“Such an arrangement should be made that the vaccines are not wasted. Only those who are to be vaccinated should be allowed entry in vaccination centres,” he said. Registration of beneficiaries for the third phase was launched on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/uttar-pradesh-to-float-global-tender-for-40-50-million-vaccine-doses-101619731126519.html
30-04-2021||Chandigarh||Amid depleting stock, HP asks Centre for more O2 cylinders||With Himachal Pradesh’s stock of oxygen cylinders rapidly running out amid a surge in coronavirus cases, the state government asked the Centre to provide immediate relief on Thursday. Chief minister Jai Ram Thakur, while reviewing the Covid situation in the state, said, “We have sufficient liquid oxygen. However, supply needs to be regulated. I have spoken to the Union health minister and have demanded 5,000 D type and 3,000 B type cylinders as we are experiencing a shortage in the state.” The CM also called a meeting of BJP legislators to take suggestions on restrictions to be imposed for containing the spread of the virus. In the wake of the sharp increase in Covid cases, the government has imposed a ban on community feasts (dham), which are traditionally organised during marriage celebrations. The number of people allowed to attend social gatherings has already been capped at 20. It was decided during the review meeting that all educational institutes and temples in the state will remain closed till May 10. Government offices will continue to function for five days a week at 50% attendance of Class 3 and 4 employees till May 10. Delay in test reports flagged The availability of Covid beds in the worst affected districts — Kangra, Mandi, Shimla, Solan, Una and Sirmaur — was reviewed and the delay in receiving test reports flagged. Nowadays, Covid reports results are being sent after 72 hours and at times it has taken up to five days. Shortage of man power at the laboratory was being cited as one of the primary reasons for the delay.The government has constituted four committees to handle the Covid crisis — logistics committee headed by Arindam Chaudhary, managing director, HP State Electronic Development Corporation, which will also monitor availability of oxygen and plan for creation of additional bed capacity; Covid patients and ambulance management committee headed by Dr Rajesh Thakur, system security officer, National Health Mission (NHM) will ensure creation of triage space at all facilities, and facilitate inter-district movement of patients; corporate social responsibility coordination and contribution committee headed by Abid Hussain, director urban development will move corporate and corporate social responsibility (CSR) contributions to HP SDMA Covid-19 Fund and coordinate with all prospective donors and industrial associations.The media committee headed by Dr Nipun Jindal, managing director, NHM will disseminate up to-date data and to the media besides eliminating any information gap.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/amid-depleting-stock-hp-asks-centre-for-more-o2-cylinders-101619730224948.html
30-04-2021||Chandigarh||Doctors, hospitals stressed in J&K amid Covid surge||With the surge in Covid cases continuing across J&K, doctors are under stress with the number of patients seeking hospitalisation increasing by the day. The Sher-i-Kashmir Institute of Medical Sciences, Soura, Kashmir’s most advanced tertiary-care hospital, has 260 dedicated beds for Covid patients. However, they already have 280 Covid patients at the hospital with the number of critically ill patients increasing by the day. “We have Covid 260 beds but there are already 280 patients in the hospital. We are facing some shortage of Remdesivir because there is shortage across the country,” SKIMS medical superintendent Dr Farooq Jan said.At Srinagar Chest Disease Hospital almost all beds are occupied. “If we get any more patients then it will be come difficult to attend to them,” said a senior doctor posted at the hospital. SKIMS Resident Doctors’ Association Aabid Maqbool said this year the percentage of young patients affected by Covid is more as compared to 2020. “This time, around 50% patients in our ward are young. Another difference is the infectivity. This year, the infectivity of the virus is more. Last year, if a person would get infected. he would at most infect one or two close family members but this year all members in families are getting infected. The fatality has not increased. Overall mortality in J&K is less in comparison to the rest of the country. However, the situation is worrisome.”“At SKIMS this year we have increased the strength of ventilators and oxygen points. And the pool of sick patients is also more, he said. At Shri Maharaja Hari Singh hospital (SMHS), Srinagar, the situation is no different.“In the first wave, patients would trickle in ones, twos and threes but this time the rise is exponential. The patients are coming in groups. The first lap of second wave was hard,” said Dr Mohsin Bin Mushtaq of SMHS Hospital. “Similarly, last time we would see just one or two young patients in a ward that were young but this time around 20% cases are young. Many patients without any co-morbidity have to be admitted because their oxygen saturation is not normal,” he said.SKIMS Medical College, Bemina, department of chest medicine head Dr Javaid Malik said, “We have around 15 Covid patients and their prognosis seems promising.” Last year, the hospital was designated as a Covid hospital. At Shri Maharaja Hari Singh (SHMS) hospital, the biggest hospital associated with Government Medical College, almost all beds in six wards dedicated for Covid patients are full. “We have to wait for filling of oxygen cylinders for hours. Patients are unable to get some life-saving drugs due to shortage,” said a resident Khursheed Ahmad, whose brother in law was admitted in the hospital.At Sopore’s Covid Centre, attendants said doctors are not visiting patients. “My brother is admitted at Covid care centre of Sopore Hospital and his oxygen saturation drops to 50 sometimes and this ward is full of such patients . But for the last 24 hours not even a single doctor visited, “ said a resident Mudasir Bashir Shah. At Indoor Stadium Baramulla Covid centre in north Kashmir, which is being managed by the medical college in Baramulla, around 50 Covid patients are receiving treatment and almost 50 beds are still vacant.Some patients say despite prescriptions of Remdesivir, they were not being provided the same. “We have put messages on social media but still could not find the injection,” said Majeed Ahmad, whose cousin is admitted at the hospital.Doctors’ association Kashmir (DAK) president and influenza expert Dr Nisar ul Hassan said there is also shortage of Tocilizumab drug that prevents Covid patients from dying. He said they have been able to save lives of many Covid-19 patients in Kashmir hospitals with early institution of the drug.“But, now the drug has run out of stock in valley hospitals putting lives of patients at risk. “We must ensure that every patient who needs the drug should be able to access it,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/doctors-hospitals-stressed-in-j-k-amid-covid-surge-101619730104827.html
30-04-2021||Dehradun||Uttarakhand puts Char Dham yatra on hold amid spike||Burnt by its experience with the Mahakumbh, and worried that the Char Dham yatra could end up being another super-spreader event, the Uttarakhand government on Thursday postponed the pilgrimage to four of the holiest Hindu shrines in the state, scheduled to start on May 14.The move comes even as a surging second wave of Covid-19 wave has pushed daily infections above the 350,000-mark daily in the country, with an active caseload of over 3 million overwhelming the health care system. The Uttarakhand government was widely criticised for its poor management of the Mahakumbh, with most Covid safety protocol being followed more in the breach than in the observance; the Centre too was criticised for allowing the event to go ahead.But the state seems to have woken up to the threat of Covid-19 now.“Even locals will not be allowed inside the shrines,” said chief minister Tirath Singh Rawat who, ahead of the Kumbh, spoke of how faith would overcome fear. “Only priests of the Char Dham shrines will perform rituals and worship. People will not be allowed to undertake the yatra [pilgrimage], given the sharp increase in Covid-19 cases.”Officials said the portals of the shrines of Kedarnath, Badrinath, Yamunotri, and Gangotri will remain open during the pilgrimage season.Four senior seers died of Covid-19 after participating in Mahakumbh in Uttarakhand’s Haridwar this month. Millions of devotees attended the mega fair from April 1, when the state had 2,236 active Covid-19 cases. The number of active cases rose to 45,383 on Wednesday.Swami Avdheshanand Giri, Mahamandleshwar (head) of Juna Akhada, the largest of the 13 sects of seers, was on April 17 forced to declare the conclusion of the Mahakumbh amid the surge in the cases. The announcement came after a phone call from Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who requested only symbolic participation in the fourth and last Shahi Snan (holy dip) in the Ganga at the mega fair on April 27.Ravinath Raman, the chief executive officer of Char Dham Devasthanam Management Board, said a meeting was held on Thursday, where the decision to postpone the pilgrimage due to the Covid-19 situation was taken. “If later in the year, the situation improves, the yatra can be allowed with conditions and Covid curbs.”Political and religious gatherings have been cited among the reasons for the worst surge of Covid-19 infections that India faces. The second wave of the pandemic has pushed the death toll in the country over 200,000 and starved hospitals of life-saving medical oxygen and beds.Uttarakhand has been reporting its highest ever daily cases and Covid deaths for the past week. On Wednesday, the state reported 6,054 cases and 108 deaths, the highest in a day since March last year.Kedarnath, Badrinath, Yamunotri, and Gangotri are collectively called Char Dham and millions visit them annually. The pilgrimage begins from Yamunotri in the west. It then proceeds to Gangotri and finally to Kedarnath and Badrinath in the east.The pilgrimage could not begin last year as per schedule on April 26 with the opening of portals of Yamunotri and Gangotri, the first two shrines that are opened after winter, because of the lockdown imposed to check the pandemic spread in March 2020.The shrines were opened for local pilgrims on July 1 last year and for those from other states in the last week of that month. In September, the Uttarakhand government removed the condition of having negative Covid-19 reports for pilgrims to undertake the pilgrimage.Officials said the portals of the Yamunotri shrine will be opened on May 14 and that of Gangotri on May 15 on the occasion of Akshay Tritiya. Portals of Kedarnath and Badrinath shrines will be opened on May 17 and May 18.Anoop Nautiyal, the founder of Dehradun-based think tank Social Development for Communities who has been analysing Covid-19 data in the state, welcomed the decision to postpone the yatra. “Once the caseload, deaths, and positivity rate decline, we can consider restarting the yatra with suitable precautions. In the meantime, the government must provide financial support to the tourism and pilgrimage sector. Mass vaccination and urgent ramping up of public health infrastructure is the need of the hour.”Congress spokesperson Garima Dasauni said the move to postpone the pilgrimage is a practical one. “The government should also think of taxi operators, dhaba and hotel owners, shopkeepers and others involved in the yatra whose livelihoods will be affected. The government should provide them some monetary help.”Manveer Singh Chauhan, the state media in charge of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party said the government is fully committed to fighting the pandemic with all possible resources. “With the present pandemic situation, the move was much needed. As far as the livelihood of those connected with the yatra is concerned, the government will soon announce some relief measures for them.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/uttarakhand-puts-char-dham-yatra-on-hold-amid-spike-101619729450393.html
30-04-2021||Chandigarh||Charges of heinous crime no hurdle in considering bail to minors: HC||The Punjab and Haryana High Court has ruled that the allegations of involvement in a heinous crime should not be an impediment in granting bail to a minor. The high court bench of Justice Sudip Ahluwalia observed that the primary reason for denying bail to a juvenile/child in conflict with the law is the possibility of their coming into contact, or being brought into association, with any known criminal. The bench observed, “There is nothing in Section 12(1) of the Juvenile Justice Act to indicate that entitlement of a juvenile for bail is to be curtailed simply because the offence for which they are charged with happens to be ‘henious’. The idea of justice would be defeated if such entitlement is disregarded simply because of the applicability of any henious offences in a given case when the legislation does not contemplate that such offences are to be treated in a different manner in Section 12(1) of the Juvenile Justice Act.” The bench set aside an order of an SBS Nagar court which had upheld the order of the district juvenile justice board, denying bail to a minor accused in a murder case registered in March last year. The trial court had observed that “there is danger to physical, mental and psychological safety of the minor” and it was better to keep him in the safe confines of a protection home. “If those who commit a heinous crime like murder are granted bail, the conscience of society will be shocked,” it had said. The HC said the reasoning given by the trial court in denying bail was not in consonance with the basic objective behind the special legislation contained in the Juvenile Justice Act, particularly when the minor is in confinement in the protection home for almost a year. The court also took note of submissions from the state government that two other accused, who are major now, are in custody and so there is little chance of the minor being exposed to their association if released on bail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/charges-of-heinous-crime-no-hurdle-in-considering-bail-to-minors-hc-101619728004679.html
30-04-2021||Mumbai||Bombay HC refuses to stay preliminary probes against ex-Mumbai top cop||The Bombay high court on Thursday refused to stay preliminary probes against former Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh and sought a response from the Maharashtra government on Singh’s fresh petition challenging the two inquiries initiated against him.In his petition, Singh also claimed that efforts were being made to thwart the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI)-led investigation into his allegations against former Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh.Mentioning the petition for urgent hearing before a bench of justices S S Shinde and Manish Pitale, Singh’s counsel and senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi said the plea challenged two orders passed by the state government on April 1, directing state director general of police (DGP) Sanjay Pandey to probe whether the former top cop had violated provisions of the All India Service (Conduct) Rules, 1968.Another order on April 20 asked Pandey to look into allegations made by police inspector Anup Dange that Singh’s brother had demanded ₹2 crore for getting him (Dange) reinstated after he was suspended on disciplinary grounds on July 18 last year.Singh, in his plea, also claimed that during his meeting with Pandey on April 19, the latter “advised him” to withdraw his letter against Deshmukh which he had sent to the state government in March. The petitioner sought interim protection and a stay on the inquiries till further orders.The bench, however, refused to stay the two orders after additional public prosecuto Deepak Thakare informed the court that Singh had not been issued any summons or show-cause notice so far and hence, it was premature to stay the same. The court accepted the argument and in light of the urgency. posted the hearing for May 4.On March 25, Singh had approached the HC, seeking a CBI inquiry into the corruption charges against Deshmukh who allegedly ordered suspended police officer Sachin Vaze, ACP Sanjay Patil and DCP Raju Bhujbal to collect protection money from restaurants and bars among other establishments to the tune of ₹100 crore per month.After hearing all sides over a period of ten days, the HC, on April 5, directed the CBI not to register an FIR but to conduct a preliminary inquiry and conclude it within 15 days. The CBI, after completing its enquiry, had registered an FIR against Deshmukh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-refuses-to-stay-preliminary-probes-against-ex-mumbai-top-cop-101619727701713.html

Lambi SHO Chander Shekhar on Thursday said president of Students Organisation of India (SOI) Arshdeep Singh alias Robin Brar is among the arrested. “All accused have been booked under Sections 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) of the Indian Penal Code,” said the SHO, adding that they were later released on bail. “Sukhbir’s name also figures in the FIR. We are yet to arrest him and another SAD leader Bhim Waraich. Police are also trying to identify others who had violated restrictions,” said the SHO. The SAD president had held a large political gathering of youth activists at his residence in Muktsar. Brar, the newly appointed head of SOI, SAD’s student wing, had reached Sukhbir’s residence with his supporters. Even as the Punjab government has imposed a ban on all social, political and cultural events, more than 100 activists of SOI and SAD were present when Sukhbir addressed the gathering. Muktsar SSP spokesperson on Wednesday night had stated that an FIR had been lodged only against Brar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/badal-village-event-sukhbir-booked-ex-mla-among-6-sad-leaders-arrested-for-violating-pandemic-protocols-101619727709260.html
30-04-2021||Chandigarh||Vaccination makers likely to give Punjab delivery dates for 18+ today||The Punjab government is likely to get the schedule for the delivery of the anti-coronavirus shots ordered for vaccinating those aged above 18 by Friday. “No assurance has been given by the two vaccine manufactures about the delivery. But in a meeting through video conferencing, the Centre on Thursday assured the states that the manufactures will convey about the supply of doses tomorrow,” principal secretary (health and family welfare) Hussan Lal said. Lal said the date of starting the vaccination drive will depend on the schedule and the consequent delivery of doses. The states were also assured that the manufactures may start the supply in small batches for a few days depending on the volume of production, he added. The Punjab health department has made it clear that it will not be possible to start the campaign to vaccinate all above 18 years of age from May 1 as was announced by the central government because of shortage of doses. The state, last week, had booked an order of 30 lakh doses of Covishield with the Pune-based Serum Institute of India (SII). An order was also placed with Bharat Biotech for the supply of Covaxine vaccine, it is learnt. A health department official said currently the state is left with a stock of only less than 1 lakh doses and it will suffice for the next day only. “If the supplies remain dry like this, we won’t be able to vaccinate our 45-plus category population or even the frontline workers. In the days to come, we need more supplies for administering the second dose as well,” the official said. The state on Thursday is likely to administer 78,598 shots, including 19,892 second doses. “We could not conduct proper vaccinations at nearly 500 session sites of a total of 3,356 across Punjab because in the absence of supply,” said the official. Punjab health minister Balbir Singh Sidhu said the state has the capacity to administer 3 lakh doses a day provided there is enough supply from the Centre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/vaccination-makers-likely-to-give-punjab-delivery-dates-for-18-today-101619727708173.html

Sources in the police said a CCTV camera footage shows the accused climbing over the outer wall of the jail by making a human tower standing on shoulders and then using a rope to descend on the other side. “I can’t disclose much, but the accused Inderjit, an ex-army trainer, was well versed with climbing and overcoming such obstacles. We have procured CCTV camera footage from the area and trying to find out who picked them from outside of jail,” said a source, while police are tightlipped. Patiala SSP Vikram Jeet Duggal said an SIT has been formed and police across the country have been alerted.

Gurbaksh Singh, of Sekhan Majra village in Mohali, was arrested by Tarn Taran police during investigation. Two other accused Anil Kumar and Amarjit Kaur are already out on bail. “During investigation, no recovery of any spurious liquor or illicit liquor or any other material used to distil illicit liquor or alcohol has been affected from the applicant to connect him with the contents of alleged secret information. As submitted by the learned counsel for the applicant that co-accused Amarjit Kaur and Anil Kumar have been granted similar concession of regular bail and on the basis of parity also the applicant is entitled for the grant of concession of regular bail. No useful purpose would be served by keeping the applicant behind the bars for an indefinite period, as the trial is unlikely to conclude in the near future,” the judge noted.Applicant’s counsel Hira Singh Sandhu had told the court his client was falsely implicated in the case on the basis of a confessional statement of the co-accused. Of 140 deaths, 84 were reported in Tarn Taran city and its adjoining villages, while the other deaths were reported in Amritsar-rural and Batala’s villages.

30-04-2021||Chandigarh||In conflict zone, dentists battle virus with tech||It’s safety first as dentists of the tricity are pulling out all stops to ensure full protection for patients in these challenging Covid times. Working in the conflict zone for more than a year, these silent warriors in white have stepped up their guard to continue extending relief to those in need as the second wave surges. The dentists were treating only emergencies when the lockdown was imposed in March last year and they heeded to the call by the Indian Dental Association (IDA) to temporarily suspend all non-urgent treatment until the crisis blew over. Clinics reopened in compliance with the Covid-19 protocol issued on May 16, 2020. Almost a year on, our dental clinics are geared up with state-of-the-art protection procedure for a safe experience. Dr JS Batth, an endodontist, implantologist and cosmetic dentist, who runs a high-end clinic in Sector 5, Panchkula, says, “We have put up a protection shield that removes up to eight times more aerosols and viruses than traditional electrostatic sterilisation. An extra oral suction machine, a high-pressure plasma air purifier and a fumigator are just some of the features added in these challenging times.” His spic and span clinic that oozes calm is aimed at relaxing the patient before he/she is put through a virtual tour of the line of treatment. “Patients need reassurance, particularly in these trying times. The dentist’s job is not firefighting alone. It’s my responsibility to inform the patient when he/she is at the receptive best about what lies ahead.” Dr Batth, who has been practising for 25 years, says during pre-Covid times, he and his wife, Dr Harpreet Batth, who is a prosthodontist and principal at BRS Dental College, would work in two shifts but now they have restricted themselves to one shift as preparation and sanitisation take a lot of time. “We need to recondition the atmosphere. There can’t be any cross-contamination. Our stringent standards draw patients from other cities besides NRIs and it’s all by word of mouth,” he says. Tech to their advantage Dr Rahul Diwan, an orthodontist practising in Sector 19, Chandigarh, says despite the safety protocols, the second Covid-19 wave has led to a 60% dip in new cases. “I see a drop of another 10% in May. Patients are wary to undergo elective and cosmetic treatment. They are refraining till they get vaccinated. Most of my patients are between 18 and 35 years and vaccination opens up for them from May 1 so I see the situation improving after next month.” Dr Diwan, who is a consultant at a dozen clinics in the tricity, says that dentists see patients only on appointment after taking the travel history unless it’s an urgent matter. “The appointment is granted preferably after a video call so that we can assess if the patient really needs to visit the clinic. We get a fair idea simply by looking at the problem. Once an appointment is granted, we ensure the clinic is sanitised and there is no overlap of patients. Only the patient is allowed in and the relative or attendant waits outside. We send a link over the phone for digital payment,” he says. Calm and caution prescribed Dr Anupam Kakkar, who runs a clinic in Sector 12, Panchkula, recalls how patients were far more careful during the first wave. “There was a fear of the unknown back then, but this time they tend to be lax. So, we have had to up the guard further. We grant appointments only after a telephonic assessment,” he says. The dentists now don N-95/100 masks, goggles or faceshields, gowns or PPE kits to stay protected. They admit the footfall has fallen since pre-Covid times but see no reason to panic. Rather, they urge people to stay safe by following simple oral hygiene measures such as brushing after meals or at least twice a day, flossing and warm saline rinses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/in-conflict-zone-dentists-battle-virus-with-tech-101619725910699.html
30-04-2021||Chandigarh||84-hr lockdown not enough in J&K: Experts||With 11 Jammu and Kashmir districts going into an 84-hour lockdown on Thursday evening, medical experts and social workers said it is not enough to arrest the spread and have sought an extended lockdown. The decision to impose the lockdown was taken after at least 3,000 cases and 30 deaths were reported in the UT over the last two days. Citing the surge in cases since April, Dr Javid, a senior doctor at Government Medical College, said, “The lockdown should be imposed for at least a week for it to be effective as a lot of critically-ill patients are reporting to the hospital. Hopefully, the lockdown will help bring down infections.” Another doctor, at a reputed Covid hospital, said the lockdown could prove beneficial. “Imposition of a lockdown had worked last year. This time, too, the government should extend the lockdown, especially in high caseload districts.” Local journalist and activist Rifat Abdullah said, “If the Jammu and Kashmir government sincerely wishes to save the lives of those already affected with Covid or already hospitalised then a 15-day lockdown or curfew is a must.”  “I have seen the conditions of hospitals. Beds are increasingly being occupied and if the trend continues things may go out of hand. Sadly, despite watching people die, many people are still not following standard operating procedures,” Abdullah. Recently, some officials had also suggested a complete lockdown in high caseload areas. At present, there are dozens of micro zones in J&K. People lineup for curfew passesHours before the start of curfew many people could be seen lining up outside government offices for curfew passes. “Deluge of calls/messages & deputations at office for Curfew passes even before a #Lockdown comes into force from 7:00 pm today. I appeal everyone again to pl stay indoors. Ensuring Essential services is my duty. Leave that to me. Let’s #BreakTheChain #StriveForSafeSrinagar, (sic)” tweeted Aijaz Asad, deputy commissioner, Srinagar.The Jammu and Kashmir Police have assured hassle-free movement of doctors and essential staff during the lockdown. “During lockdown, all police units have been directed to facilitate hassle-free movement of doctors, health workers and essential services,” said Kashmir inspector general Vijay Kumar.Immediate action needed to contain spread: TarigamiCPI (M) general secretary Mohammed Yousuf Tarigami has asked the J&K government to take immediate steps to contain Covid deaths and infections. The former legislator said, “The healthcare system across the country and in J&K seems to be on the edge due to a massive increase in the number of patients following the second wave of Covid. A large number of patients are coming to hospital due to which there is shortage of beds, intensive care units (ICUs) and other essential medicines such as Remdesivir in different hospitals across J&K.” He also flagged the need to ensure uninterrupted oxygen supply in hospitals and the need to keep outpatient departments open. He said that stepping up vaccinations will not affect the rise of the second wave, but will definitely save many lives.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/84hr-lockdown-not-enough-in-j-k-experts-101619725909666.html

HC said that it did not want hospitals to turn into potential “lakshagriha (house of lacquer)” of the epic Mahabharata and that the safety of patients was of paramount importance. “We do not want these hospitals to be potential jatugriha [lakshagriha]. These hospitals [which met with fire incidents] are all jatugrihas. This is not the way people should lose their lives,” HC observed. In Mahabharata, the jatugriha (Lakshagrih) was a house made of wax, through which Kauravas attempted to eliminate Pandavas during their exile period. HC took a serious cognisance of the various fire incidents and accidents that took place in the past month across Maharashtra, including the recent one at Mumbra in Thane district where at least four patients admitted in the intensive care unit of a private hospital died after a major fire broke out on Wednesday. The court, while hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) alleging improper Covid-19 management in the state, asked advocate general of Maharashtra if the government can consider a total lockdown like last year for 15 days to contain the virus spread and if citizens could be indoors unless the absolute need to go out. A division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni, while hearing a PIL filed by lawyer Sneha Marjadi alleging mismanagement in treatment during the second wave of Covid-19 in Maharashtra, sought directions pertaining to shortage of Remdesivir and oxygen supply among other prayers. Hinting that it would be constrained to widen the scope of the PIL, the bench said, “You [civic authorities] have to conduct a fire audit of all hospitals and seek compliance earliest. If patients are being admitted in hospitals, their lives should be saved there.” Questioning how permissions were granted to hospitals which compromised with stipulated norms, the court held that wherever there are indoor patients, their safety is of paramount importance. The bench noted that the patients were already going through agony and pain when hospitalised, without checking on whether the hospital is safe or not. “We understand these are special times and everything is put to test. We have to leave our work aside and look into basic compliances. We do not want any fire incidents now.” Appearing on behalf of BMC, senior advocate Anil Sakhare informed the court that the civic authority had already initiated action pertaining to fire audit and compliances and would be in a position to give data and respond to the queries of the court in the next hearing. While referring to the Nagpur incident, wherein an octogenarian offered his hospital bed to a younger man saying that he had lived his life and the young man needed to live, chief justice Datta said, “We salute the senior citizen for his sacrifice. If the authorities had woken up earlier, both lives could have been saved.” The bench did not mince words when it came to the citizens flouting safety norms while the Covid-19 restrictions were in place and said that the authorities could not always be blamed for the situation and referred to the incident wherein a district magistrate had to stop a marriage. “We do not appreciate the way in which the DM conducted himself but the fact remains that the citizens are not abiding and hence such action was necessitated,” said the bench adding that such an approach by the citizens contributed to the further spread of the Covid-19 pandemic. “If we as citizens fail, what is going to happen? You want to have marriages, festivals etc without following norms? Are we waiting for the third wave? First we do not care about basic things [protocols] and then we hunt for oxygen and medicines. This is the current state,” noted chief justice Datta. Thereafter, the bench asked advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni to “advise” the government to consider at least a 15-day total lockdown. “We are not passing any mandamus, but please advise the government. At least for 15 days, if people stay indoors unless there is absolute need to come out, we may expect better results,” said the bench. The court while asking the government to ensure Remdesivir injections were sufficiently supplied to private hospitals, sought responses from the authorities and posted further hearing to May 4.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/dont-want-hospitals-to-become-potential-lakshagrihas-says-bombay-hc-101619725723959.html

A total 2.2kg of cocaine, stuffed in 101 capsules, worth ₹13.35 crore has been seized from them under the Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985. DRI on Thursday said that based on specific inputs on April 22, the accused – Mtwanzi Carlos Adam and Rashid Paul Sayula – travelling from Dar-es-Salaam, Tanzania, to Mumbai via Addis Ababa, were apprehended. DRI had intelligence that they were carrying some narcotics substances in their body. Hence, DRI officers secured permission from the court for the medical examination of the two suspects and admitted them to the state-run Sir JJ Hospital. The doctors found about the presence of some foreign objects in their stomach during the X-ray screening of the suspects. During interrogation, Adam and Sayula admitted to have swallowed 54 and 97 capsules, respectively, before embarking on the flight to Mumbai. Both were placed under arrest on Thursday, as they were at the hospital till Wednesday. A city court on Thursday remanded them to judicial custody. A DRI officer said that the investigation so far has confirmed that the drug syndicate is also smuggling the narcotics through mules who conceal the contraband in their body and travel to India on medical visa. “This is the third such case of smuggling of narcotics detected by DRI Mumbai in the past six months wherein a medical visa facility has been abused by foreign nationals of African countries,” said a senior DRI officer. DRI further stated that while demand for cocaine has continued during the pandemic – as it is a drug of choice for the elite – its availability has reduced due to international travel curbs, thereby making smuggling by concealing in body a more lucrative option. Hence, this seizure of cocaine during the current lockdown is significant. DRI Mumbai had made record seizures of narcotics drugs and psychotropic substances amid the pandemic in 2020 and this year and seized drugs like heroin, cocaine, mephedrone, ephedrine and ketamine, worth ₹646 crore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/dri-seizes-cocaine-worth-13-35-crore-from-2-foreign-nationals-at-mumbai-airport-101619725603795.html

Singh did not respond to calls and messages.Police sources said the case would now be investigated by an assistant commissioner of police.The complainant, BR Ghadge, posted at Akola city police control room, belongs to the Scheduled Caste community. He has alleged that as he had refused to follow Singh’s illegal orders to benefit some accused in a criminal case, Singh conspired with others and registered three extortion and a corruption case between August 23 and September 3, 2015, against him. Ghadge claimed that the accused policemen falsely implicated him in these cases to harass him.“The then commissioner, in an unruly manner, intentionally deprived me from the post of senior inspector (in-charge) of Bazar Peth police station out of grudge and appointed officers way junior to him on the post. This was also against the August 19, 2015, order of Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe Commission, Worli,” Ghadge had stated in an earlier complaint to police.“I was placed under suspension by Singh from August 23, 2015, to November 28, 2018, as a breach of my fundamental rights,” said Ghadge, who in the past had made 13 complaints regarding the alleged injustice on him.Other than Singh, those who are made accused in the case include 15 police officers who were posted at Thane when Singh was the commissioner of police at Thane between 2015 and 2018. They face 27 sections under the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989, Indian Penal Code, Maharashtra Police Act and Civil Rights Protection Act.The FIR (of which HT has a copy) mainly revolves around a 2013 criminal case against the then Kalyan Dombivli Municipal Corporation officials for allegedly giving extra floor space index to builders in the names of deceased people. Ghadge had alleged that while probing this scam, he had made 26 people, including three former municipal commissioners of KDMC and other senior civic officials and builders, an accused. However, Singh had asked him to drop the names of the senior civic officials.Singh had called Ghadge and his staff to his office on April 15, 2015, and ordered him to remove the names of 22 civic officials named in the case and instructed him to send a report to KDMC recommending departmental action against them, Ghadge alleged.However, Ghadge had refused to oblige and informed Singh that he, in due consultation and supervision of the then joint commissioner of Thane Police VV Laxminarayan, had applied appropriate sections of the Prevention of Corruption Act, as the accused were involved in criminal misconduct.Ghadge claimed that Laxminarayan had also approved his investigation and invocation of sections of the Prevention of Corruption Act against the officials.Later, only four accused were charge sheeted in the case, while names of remaining 22 officials were dropped, he said.Earlier, Ghadge had written a 14-page complaint against Singh and others on April 20 to chief minister Uddhav Thackerey, home minister Dilip Walse Patil, director general of state police Sanjay Pandey and DG anti-corruption bureau, alleging that while serving as commissioner of Thane Police, Singh indulged in several illegal and corrupt acts and made crores of rupees.In the letter, he had claimed that Singh gave orders to police officers to extricate some influential people from criminal cases registered against them, allegedly in return for huge sums of money.Recently, Singh was removed as Mumbai Police commissioner for “mishandling” of the Antilia explosives case and the murder of Mansukh Hiran, the man in possession of the vehicle in which the explosives were found outside the residence of billionaire Mukesh Ambani. Hiran reported the vehicle stolen around a week before it was found with the explosives in late February. Hiran was subsequently found dead.Mumbai Police officer Sachin Vaze has been named as the main accused in both cases by the National Investigation Agency. After his removal as commissioner, Singh wrote a letter to CM, alleging that the state’s home minister Anil Deshmukh instructed Vaze and some other Mumbai Police officers to extort money from dance bars, bars and restaurants and hookah parlours in the city.Singh had also approached courts with his complaint, following which the Bombay high court ordered the Central Bureau of Investigation to conduct a preliminary enquiry into the matter, after which Deshmukh was compelled to resign. CBI had subsequently, on April 21, registered a regular case against Deshmukh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/thane-police-to-probe-cop-s-plaint-against-param-bir-singh-101619725423955.html
30-04-2021||Other||CBI files closure report in 46 of 71 cases against gangster Chhota Rajan||Five-and-half years after his deportation to India, a special Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA) court on April 22 acquitted underworld don Rajendra Sadashiv Nikalje alias Chhota Rajan in the two-decade-old Hanif Kadawala murder case. Kadawala, an accused in the March 1993 Mumbai bombings case, had allegedly helped Sanjay Dutt hide an AK-47 rifle that was delivered to the actor. Kadawala was also accused to have transported weapons to Mumbai on the instructions of Tiger Menon, the prime conspirator in the blasts case, which were meant to be used for the bombings. Kadawala was shot dead on February 7, 2001, in his office. The special court acquitted the gangster after the investigating officer of the case revealed that one of the accused in the case, Yusuf Bachkana, who acquitted in 2004, had claimed that Kadawala was killed at the instance of his elder brother Farooq. The Kadawala murder case was Rajan’s sixth trial concluded so far after his extradition. The gangster has so far been also convicted in three other cases, including journalist J Dey’s murder case, in which he has been sentenced to life imprisonment. On March 16, a special MCOCA court had convicted Rajan and six members of his gang for firing at bookie-turned-builder Ajay Gosaliya in 2013. The same day, special judge AT Wankhede sentenced Rajan, his financer Kaushik Rajgaur, sharpshooter Satish Kalia, as well as Sunilkumar alias Piyush Tiwari, Vilas Singh, Arvind Shinde and Prakash Nikak – who executed the plan – to 10 years of rigorous imprisonment. The court also imposed fine of ₹5 lakh on each of them. Rajan has so far been convicted in four cases, which includes the murder of journalist J Dey, cases of firing at builders BR Shetty and Ajay Gosalia. In Dey’s murder case, Rajan has been sentenced to life imprisonment. Rajan has been, however, acquitted in fisherman John Pareira’s murder case. It was one of the oldest cases against the gangster, which was decided by the special Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) court in June 2018. On February 21, 1983, a murder case was registered with the Santacruz police station after John Pareira, 35, was stabbed at Juhu beach, allegedly over disputes on smuggling business. After Rajan was deported from Bali in November 2015, the Centre, with the consent of the Maharashtra government, issued a notification transferring all cases against him to CBI. Mumbai Police had listed 71 cases against Rajan which were transferred to CBI on November 21, 2015. Of the 71 cases, CBI has already filed closure report in 46 cases before the respective special MCOCA and magistrate courts set up to try the gangster. “We have closed several old cases where it was not possible to trace witnesses and collect further evidence. We had no material. It was not possible to obtain primary evidence like the call data records of the accused involved in the crime and others connected in such old cases,” said advocate Pradeep Gharat, who is appointed as the special public prosecutor to conduct trials in cases against Rajan. Gharat said most of the cases of extortion, which were transferred to magistrate courts, had also been closed for want of evidence. “In most of these cases, complainants have either died or are not traceable. Further, the officers could not get any key evidence to put up before the court,” Gharat added. Rajan’s lawyer Tushar Khandare, however said, “Rajan was never involved in the cases in which the agency has filed closure report. In many of these cases, his name was misused and the crimes were committed without his knowledge. As he was not in India, the agencies could never verify his role. It was only after extradition, facts became evident, and it was found that he was not involved.” The cases which are closed are mostly old cases of gang rivalry and murders of businessmen who refused to give in to Rajan’s demands. In one such case, businessman Sham Sunder Raj was shot on July 3, 1995, in his office. He was seriously injured and died later. In another case, two unidentified shooters fired bullets at Ashok Krishna Shetty, a cousin of Karianna Shetty, the owner of the Ashoka Hotel, on May 27, 1993. In another case, Chembur resident Bala Kotian was shot dead on October 7, 1998, in was primarily a case of gang war. Similarly, a case registered in 1997 for conspiring to kill senior journalist Baljeet Parmar has also been closed. The prosecution claimed that they could not trace witnesses in the case. Among the pending cases, Rajan is facing trial in the murder cases of hotelier Jaya Shetty, union leader Datta Samant and builder Majid Khan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/cbi-files-closure-report-in-46-of-71-cases-against-gangster-chhota-rajan-101619725304920.html

The pantry served eatables, bottled water and beverages. Packed snacks, food and bottled water would be available at some platforms. The trains in which the pantry has been suspended are Amritsar Shatabdi (Amritsar-New Delhi), Vande Bharat (Katra-New Delhi), Shri Shakti Special (Katra-New Delhi) and Jammu Rajdhani (Jammu Tawi-New Delhi). Starting May 1, the railways has also cancelled Amritsar-New Delhi Shatabdi (train number 02013 and 02014) due to low occupancy.Arvinder Singh, a Ludhiana-based trader, said, “For the sake of children and elderly, the railways should provide cold water and packed snacks in trains.

30-04-2021||Other||IIT-Bombay alumna seek action against professor of Kharagpur campus||A group of alumna members of Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay (IIT-B) on Thursday have urged the director of IIT-Kharagpur (IIT-KGP) to take action against a professor who was allegedly seen verbally abusing a preparatory class for students belonging to the scheduled castes (SC) and scheduled tribes (ST) categories and those with physical disabilities in a video.In a letter to IIT-KGP’s director Virendra Kumar Tewari, alumni said the video, that had emerged four days ago, has “horrified” them. They demanded that Tewari take immediate action against the violation of classroom ethics, create a safe space for students to place their grievances and attend to them on an urgent basis with immediate action. Despite repeated attempts, Tewari remained unavailable for a comment. Videos of Seema Singh, an associate professor from IIT-KGP’s humanities and social sciences department emerged on social media on Sunday where she can be heard repeatedly hurling abuses at students reportedly attending online preparatory classes meant for students from SC, ST categories and those with physical disabilities. The recordings, which are under the institute’s review, were posted anonymously on IIT-KGP’s confessions page, an informal group of students on social media.The 25 IIT-B alumna include Anupama Krishnamurthy (class of 1988), researcher at French Institute Pondicherry; Shaibani Azam (class of 1986), professor at Jamia Millia University; Enakshi Bhattacharya (class of 1980), professor at IIT-Madras; Deepti Pradhan (class of 1986); associate director of research at Yale University and Chayanika Shah (class of 1986), retired lecturer, KJ Somaiya College of Science and Commerce.“We were students at a time when the gender ratio in IIT-B was less than 5%. As minority students on campus, we have experienced many sexist comments from teachers and recognise today how their actions and statements made an adverse impact on our learning environment. We, hence, speak from some personal experience of discrimination at IIT-campuses. We were even then aware of the ways in which those who came from marginalised caste backgrounds, were not English speaking, or were from smaller towns were discriminated against,” wrote the group.The women had also participated in a strike in 1980 when four students had raised their voice against IIT-B’s order cancelling their admissions on the grounds that they had a backlog in courses and were not able to cope with the undergraduate programme. The unprecedented strike had forced the institute to a grinding halt for almost 40 days.“Some of us are now a part of the academia, while a few of us have seen how discrimination at institutes works. We are also seeing a surge in the number of cases of discrimination coming out. This reminds us of our experience as a minority on campus. Since 1980, we have been reiterating that it not enough for institutes to just bring in students from diverse backgrounds. There’s a need to make them feel safe and supported,” said Shah.Institutions are not fit to look after diverse students in their present state, Shah added. “While a complete overhaul of the education system is ideal, there are things institutes can do immediately. They must set up anti-discrimination cells, train teachers on how to treat diversity and reduce the emphasis on [academic] performance,” she said. Meanwhile, the videos, which are viral on social media, have sparked an outrage across campuses. While Singh has apologised to students for her behaviour in an email, many student and alumni bodies across campuses have started online petitions demanding action against her and the creation of an SC/ ST cell at IITs. The Science Education Group (SEG), a students’ forum at IIT-KGP, issued a statement on Wednesday: “There have also been previous unverified reports that state her [Seema’s] brazen and abusive behaviour with students. She has an alleged history of doing these things. One thing that can be concluded from all this is that primarily this is systematic power abuse, which often goes under the carpet and secondarily, underlines the casteist behaviour of the system…” Meanwhile on Tuesday, the National Commission for Scheduled Castes issued letters to the institute, Union education ministry, West Bengal’s government and director general of police, informing them that the commission will investigate the matter. “The commission has taken a suo-motu cognisance of the use of unparliamentary language and casteist remarks made by professor Seema Singh while taking a class of SC/ ST students… Her remarks have hurt the sentiments of many Indians, specifically the SC community,” the commission wrote.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/iitbombay-alumna-seek-action-against-professor-of-kharagpur-campus-101619725123889.html
30-04-2021||Mumbai||Second wave: Passengers allege airlines refuse to help even when they test positive for Covid||As the country grapples with the impact of the second wave of Covid-19 and citizens choose to stay indoors, those who had booked flights are facing issues around cancellations and ticket refunds. To add to the misery, passengers testing positive for Covid-19 before their travel date are not being exempted from cancellation charges. Social media pages of a majority of the airlines are filled with complaints by disgruntled passengers as they ask for a refund either because they do not want to travel due to safety reasons or are forced to be home as they are getting treated for Covid-19 or due to their destination city announcing lockdown.Divya Mehta, a Delhi resident whose family tested positive, said that of the total ₹47,000 that they spent in booking their tickets, SpiceJet has charged them ₹30,000 as cancellation fees. Mehta said, “We were booked to fly from Delhi to Goa on April 30, but our family is currently fighting against Covid. My uncle lost his battle to the virus and my aunt is critical. How can we even step out of our homes in such a situation? We are paying heavy daily hospital charges, and our ticket refund amount means a lot to us at the moment.”According to Mehta, she has approached the airline multiple times via emails only to get their automated response. “I even tweeted our positive RT-PCR reports as proof, but the airline has not bothered to solve the issue. All they do is ask me to share details.”SpiceJet did not comment on the matter.Similar situation has been faced by other passengers too. A tweet to IndiGo by a passenger, Raman Jaiswal, read, “Hi @paytm @IndiGo6E I have a flight on 19th May..due to pandemic we can’t travel. As I wish to cancel the flight, I am getting only ₹553 refund. Kindly help me out.” While responding to Jaiswal, IndiGo’s tweet read, “Sir, we are monitoring the situation closely. As of now, we are not offering any waivers. Upon changes or cancellation, necessary charges will be applicable.”Saurabh Jain, a Chartered Accountant from Malad, was told that his RT-PCR test reports and his wife’s blood test reports were not good proofs for being medically unfit. Jain, who was to travel to Jaipur via a GoAir flight on April 25, wrote to the airline first on April 19 and then after his wife’s blood reports were out.“Due to rise in cases, RT-PCR tests are on waiting, and hence we did not get an appointment for my wife before a week. Hence, we went for blood tests to check if she too had been infected along with me. The blood reports made it clear that she was positive and that is when I wrote to the airline for the second time, attaching both our reports. However, the airline’s response to my email was that our reports weren’t enough to prove that we were Covid positive,” Jain said.He added, “I am shocked at the apathy of these airlines to people like us who are fighting against the virus and have to go through such harassment. I joined Twitter only to get a response from them as they stopped replying to me for three days. It’s a shame that people have to approach the airlines in social media in order to get them talking to us. What about those who cannot access or who do not know to operate social media accounts?” GoAir did not comment on this matter. Another passenger said she had to face refund issues. Panvel resident Nasreen Dada, who was to fly with her two children on Sunday, had to approach her personal contacts and pressure the airline to get her money back. She had booked a ticket for GoAir’s G8 330 which is the only non-stop flight between Mumbai and Kannur. Not only did the flight get cancelled three consecutive times, the airline also asked passengers to cancel the ticket from their end and refused to refund them.“I wanted to travel with my kids to see my mother who is alone in Kannur, but the airline has been cancelling the flight since Sunday. Hence we decided to ask them to cancel our tickets and refund. However, we could only get our money back only when we approached a few resourceful people and also by fighting with the airline for it.” When contacted, GoAir spokesperson said, “There have been flight cancellations on the domestic route which were connecting flights to the onward travel to Dubai and Sharjah as part of the travel embargo to Dubai and Sharjah. GoAir regrets any convenience caused to our esteemed customers.” Passengers said airlines should encourage people wanting to stay home at times when the country is seeing the fastest spread of Covid-19 virus, instead they are only trying to take advantage of the situation.GoAir, however, has been cancelling flights on other sectors too. According to the complaints on the airline’s Twitter account, it cancelled flights that included ones from Ahmedabad to Varanasi, Pune to Kolkata, Pune to Ahmedabad, Delhi to Varanasi among others.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/second-wave-passengers-allege-airlines-refuse-to-help-even-when-they-test-positive-for-covid-101619725063852.html
30-04-2021||Mumbai||Will start vaccination for 18+ only with 2.5 mn doses in hand: Maharashtra||Concerned over the availability of required quota, the Maharashtra government has decided to not roll out the vaccination drive for the third phase for the 18-44 age group, unless they have 2.5 million doses in hand. Considering the scenario of meagre supply of vaccines from two domestic manufacturers (Covishield and Covaxin), the state has also started talks with other manufacturers, namely Johnson and Johnson and Zydus Cadilla for import of vaccines. The government is also likely to open vaccination for the 18-44 age group in a staggered manner, allowing vaccination of the 26-44 age group first.Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray held meetings with key ministers and officials on Thursday to chalk out a plan for the roll-out of the third phase of the drive.The Thackeray government, in its cabinet meeting held on Wednesday, decided on free vaccination for all in the 18-44 age group.The government is, however, concerned about the availability of the desired stock even by the end of May.“The makers of home-grown Covaxin and Covishield have assured us the supply, but there is no clarity on the timeline. The Serum Institute of India has taken a purchase order for three lakh (300,000) doses, but it has not clarified by when they will be able to deliver the stock. We may start accumulating the stock we get from these two makers, but the roll-out would be only after we have at least 2.5 million doses in hand,” said an official privy to the developments.Also read | Maharashtra CM says be ready, third Covid-19 wave may hit by July-Aug“We have reached out to all makers from various countries, enquiring about the availability of vaccines and the price. We had a video-conference with the Indian executives of J&J for the procurement of their vaccine, but they have informed us their jab will be available only in August. Zydus Cadilla’s vaccine too is expected to be available by August. The talks for the Sputnik V are on at chief minister’s level. We have established contacts with almost all vaccine companies in our bid for speedy procurement,” said public health minister Rajesh Tope.Tope said that Pfizer’s jab will be available for ₹1500, while Chinese vaccines are available at ₹750.The state has almost arrived at the decision of opening the third phase for the age group of 26-44 years and comorbid people in the younger age group in the first leg. The decision is expected to be taken in the meeting of core committee of senior ministers in the next couple of days.“It is clear that the CM wants to avoid the hardships people are going through currently owing to non-availability of doses. It will not only lead to criticism, but also chaos among the working class,” the official quoted above said.Tope said the state has targeted a procurement of 120 million doses of the vaccine to complete the drive in record time.“We are ready to pay the vaccine manufacturers immediately, but they are not able to make the doses available. We have requested them to make the vaccines available on priority and apprise us of the schedule,” said Tope.The minister said the state expects positive response from global players to the expression of interest floated by them for medical equipment and drugs.“We expect the response to our expression for 25,000 metric tonnes of oxygen, 4,000 oxygen concentrators, 250 PSA plants and 20 liquid oxygen storage tanks by Monday. Besides, we have directed our district administrations to complete setting up of oxygen plants at the earliest. There is a prediction of the third wave of virus by July-August, for which the district administrations have been instructed to be prepared. Of the 125 PSA plants of oxygen generators planned at district level, most are expected to come up in the next 10 days,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/will-start-vaccination-for-18-age-group-only-with-2-5-mn-doses-in-hand-maharashtra-101619725004830.html

The court acted on the plea of 18 municipal councillors led by Paramjit Singh. The division bench of justice Ajay Tewari has also directed the petitioners to appear before the principal secretary on May 5 for presenting their case.It was alleged in the plea that the election for the post of president and vice-president was conducted by SDM Varjit Singh Walia, by show of hands. Two petitioners, Paramjit Singh and Parkash Kaur, were elected as president and vice-president respectively, with overwhelming majority, while rival candidates, namely Gurjeet Singh and Narinder Kumar were defeated.The SDM, at this stage, got signatures of all councillors, including an ex-officio member (sitting MLA) in a new register, for the purpose of writing down the proceedings of the election. Immediately thereafter, Kewal Singh Dhillon, halqa in-charge of the Congress, arrived and entered into the library hall of MC, and asked the SDM to get elections conducted once again. The SDM acted as per directions of Dhillon, and despite strong protests from petitioners, held the election once again, but the result was same, it was claimed. The petitioners have claimed that the SDM, in conspiracy with Dhillon, Gurjeet Singh and Narinder Kumar declared them as elected for the post of president and vice-president respectively, adding that they protested before the media, which had assembled outside. They complained to a number of authorities, including secretary, local government; director, local government, and the deputy commissioner, seeking an inquiry into the matter.

30-04-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra: 4 sloth bears, leopard drown in Chandrapur district||Four sloth bears were found dead at the bottom of a well in Chandrapur district, in the buffer zone of the Tadoba Andhari Tiger Reserve, on Thursday morning. The victims include one male and one female adult, and two cubs. Forest department officials suspected that the animals had drowned after falling into the well — which was not cased with vertical walls — by accident.Praveen NR, chief conservator of forests (Chandrapur) confirmed the development and said, “The autopsy results are not available yet, but the animals likely fell into the well inadvertently, perhaps when it was dark. The incident happened outside the tiger reserve area in Chandrapur forest division in Vadholi village.” He also added that the animals were not missing any body parts, ruling out any indication of poaching.Meanwhile, a six-year-old female leopard was also found dead at the bottom of a well in Pune district’s Junnar taluka on Wednesday morning. The animal was also found wrapped in a large plastic bag, eliciting scepticism as to whether its death had been staged. Autopsy results showed the animal had drowned, with water entering its lungs through the nose and mouth. Department officials said that there were no signs of poaching.“The animal was found near Dangarwadi village in Junnar taluka. A sugarcane farmer saw the animal and alerted us. The well in which the leopard drowned is surrounded by cane fields on three sides, but the crops have been harvested and the area is now being used to graze livestock. It’s possible that the leopard was looking for prey in the area,” said Manisha Kale, round forest officer, Narayangaon.Anish Andheria, chief executive officer of the Wildlife Conservation Trust, said, “Signs of drowning do not necessarily rule out other causes of death, for example poisoning. It is highly unlikely that the leopard got entangled in a plastic bag before or after drowning, but prima facie the incident merits further investigation on the part of the forest department. Theoretically, an unconscious animal (poisoned but alive) can be put in a bag and dumped in a well. A histopathology report of the organs and relevant body tissue can easily rule out poisoning. Another possibility is a road accident. A seriously injured animal can be dumped in the well to pass it off as a drowning case”.Forest department officials, however, said they have concluded the death to be due to drowning only.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-4-sloth-bears-leopard-drown-to-death-101619724703724.html
30-04-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Return SSC exam fees, say teachers and parents||After the state education department cancelled the Class 10 (SSC) exams this year, teachers and parents are demanding that the state board returns exam fees of over 17 lakh students who were set to write exams.Every year, the board charges ₹415 from regular students as exam fees against costs incurred in conducting and supervising exams and assessing answer sheets. “This year, the board will not incur charges such as stationery costs for printing papers, supervision allowances to teachers and paper assessment charges to examiners and moderators. Thus, these fees need to be returned,” said Rajesh Pandya, vice president of the Teachers Democratic Front.With nearly 17 lakh students appearing for the SSC exams every year, the board collects nearly ₹70 crore in exam fees. Dinkar Patil, chairman of the Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education said a decision is still awaited. He however added that “the board has already incurred most of the expenditure, barring the expenses concerning paper checking.”On April 20, Class 10 exams were declared cancelled by the state government due to the rising Covid-19 cases and the resultant lockdown. Students will be marked based on internal assessments and the education department is still devising a formula for the evaluation of these students.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-return-ssc-exam-fees-say-teachers-and-parents-101619724704321.html
30-04-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra CM says be ready, third Covid-19 wave may hit by July-Aug||Even as the second wave is yet to recede, Maharashtra is likely to be hit by a third wave by July and August, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray said on Thursday, citing the epidemiologists consulted by the government. He asked the state administration to be prepared for the third wave by ramping up the infrastructure, saying he didn’t want to see a repeat of the current scenario.The CM called a meeting of divisional commissioners and district collectors to take stock of the Covid situation on Thursday. State health minister Rajesh Tope said, “We will have to become self-sufficient, especially in oxygen supply. The CM said he did not want to hear any reason for shortage of oxygen supply then.”The prediction is based on advice given by the members of the state task force comprising experts from the medical field. They have made the prediction based on the study of patterns of Covid waves in various countries. According to the experts, a drop in daily cases is likely to start by May-end, but by July-end or the first week of August, cases will start rising again which will be the third wave in the state, said a senior official, requesting anonymity.Meanwhile, Maharashtra on Thursday recorded 66,159 daily infections pushing the count to 4,539,553. The tally of active cases reduced to 670,301 as 68,537 recoveries reported in the past 24 hours. The state saw 771 deaths, taking the toll to 67,985. Pune had 130, highest number of deaths across the state, with 94 fatalities in the city and 36 from its rural areas.Also read | Maharashtra logs 66,159 Covid-19 cases, 771 deaths; 68,537 recover“We want the local administration to be at an oxygen surplus by July. For this, orders for setting up 125 PSA (Pressure Swing Absorption (PSA) technology) plants have been issued and in the next 10 days, their installation will begin across the state. District collectors have been directed to procure 5 to 10 LPM oxygen concentrators in proportion to 25% of the total active patients in their respective district, so that all mild and serious patients will be able to get regular oxygen supply in any case,” the health minister said.Each tehsil should be having an oxygen generation plant, liquid oxygen storage tanks and oxygen concentrators as well, he added.Officials said that the epidemiologists are of the view that the situation is coming under control because of the lockdown has been imposed and daily cases may start going down from next month. “In the next two months, the situation will come under control but as soon as all the restrictions are lifted it is believed that the third wave will again hit the state,” said a senior official privy to the development. “The situation has come under control to some extent owing to the strict restrictions but we have to be cautious and start planning for the third wave,” the CM said in the meeting. He also asked to ensure adequate supply of medicines for the third wave.As part of the preparations, Tope said that tele-ICU facilities will be developed for tertiary treatment of patients in all two-tier cities, where there is no major government hospital or medical college. High-resolution cameras will be installed with the beds of each patient so their condition can be monitored by expert doctors in major cities. He has also directed fire audit, structural audit and oxygen supply to be conducted. District collectors have been directed to ensure hospitals are conducting these audits well in time.As the number of daily cases is yet to decline, a steep rise is recorded in Covid-19 casualties in Maharashtra. On Wednesday, the state reported close to 1000 (985) fatalities, which is highest in a day, since the outbreak in March last year. In this month alone, 12,439 deaths have been recorded, which is also highest ever in a month so far.If compared with the last two months, the toll in March was 2,495 casualties whereas in February, when a second wave hit the state, 1,072 deaths were reported. The death rate of this month has increased to 0.70% in this month (between April 1-27) from 0.38% last month, according to an analysis by the state health department. It was presented before the state cabinet meeting held on Wednesday.Dr Subhash Salunkhe, state advisor on the Covid-19 and former director general of health services said, they are experiencing an unusual behavior of the virus which is contributing to the toll.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-be-ready-third-covid-19-wave-may-hit-by-july-aug-says-cm-101619724583774.html
30-04-2021||Chandigarh||Don’t choke our hospitals, says Chandigarh adviser on outsider influx||UT adviser Manoj Parida on Thursday appealed to Chandigarh residents not to “choke” the city’s health infrastructure by “inviting friends and relatives from outside”.Amid an unprecedented spike in Covid-19 cases, Chandigarh is witnessing an influx of patients from the region and from even as far as Bihar. With New Delhi and its adjoining cities the worst hit and grappling with bed and oxygen shortage, hospitals in the city, particularly private ones, are receiving dozens of requests from there for admitting patients. At present, around 25 patients from Delhi NCR are admitted in city hospitals.During a media interaction on Tuesday, UT administrator VP Singh Badnore had claimed that the majority of beds in Chandigarh hospitals were occupied by people from other states. Data shared by Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) on Wednesday confirmed that only 30% patients at its dedicated Covid-19 hospital were from the city, while Punjab accounted for the bulk.On Thursday, Parida said: “Please do not choke our hospital infrastructure by inviting friends and relatives from outside, needing indoor Covid treatment. Our hospital beds are almost full.”‘We politely refuse non-serious patients’A senior doctor at Government Medical College and Hospital, Sector 32, wishing not to be named, said: “One day we received five patients from Delhi, who were admitted at the Sector-48 hospital. To date, 12 patients from that region have come. Though we are not encouraging them, we cannot refuse a patient who needs treatment. There are verbal orders from the administration to politely refuse admission in case the patients are not serious.”At the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, which has seen cumulative 17 admissions since March last year, currently there are 11 persons from Delhi admitted at the institute.“Patients land up in the emergency block of the hospital and there is no scope for us to refuse them on the grounds of empathy, but with our resources getting exhausted, we are also helpless,” said Dr Jagat Ram, director, PGIMER.The small private hospitals that can cater upto 20-30 patients say that dozens of calls were being received daily, requesting for oxygen beds and ventilators. However, due to full occupancy, they were not able to accommodate, they added.“Though our first priority is accomodating people from Chandigarh, if we receive patients who require intensive intervention, we have no option but to refuse them,” said Dr Sanjay Bansal of Eden Hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/dont-choke-our-hospitals-says-chandigarh-adviser-on-outsider-influx-101619724524956.html
30-04-2021||Mumbai||Bombay HC refuses to entertain PIL seeking uniform pricing for Covid vaccines||The Bombay high court (HC) on Thursday refused to entertain public interest litigation (PIL) seeking directions to the central government to apply uniform pricing of ₹150 for Covid vaccines by taking over all the stocks being manufactured by Serum Institute of India (SII) and Bharat Biotech.The HC said that as the Supreme Court was seized of matters which had national implications, it would not hear the current PIL and directed the petitioners to approach the SC. The division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni, while hearing a suo motu PIL related to the spread of Covid among jail inmates and jail staff, was informed that vaccination in jails had been stopped due to shortage. Advocate Vivek Shukla appearing on behalf of the petitioners, city-based lawyer Fayzan Khan and three law students, sought to intervene and informed the court that his PIL was on the issue of difference in the rate of the vaccine being charged by the manufacturers and should be heard. The petitioners contended that the differential pricing of the vaccines for Centre, state and private hospitals was discriminatory and pharma companies were milking the fear psychosis of increased death rate due to Covid– 19 and sought directions to the central government to acquire the entire supply and control the vaccine price. They also contended that the pharmaceutical companies were engaged in “organised loot” and the HC should intervene to protect “national public health” and ensure that the fundamental right to equality and life under the Constitution is “not left to the mercy of pharmaceutical companies”.After advocate Shukla mentioned the PIL for urgent hearing, on Thursday morning, the HC said, “The Supreme Court (which is hearing suo motu PIL on Covid management) has said that issues having pan-India effect will be dealt with by it. Vaccine pricing is a phenomenon applicable all over India and therefore we are not entertaining it (PIL) as SC has fairly covered it.”The bench suggested the petitioners should move to the Apex court for relief.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-refuses-to-entertain-pil-seeking-uniform-pricing-for-covid-vaccines-101619724523797.html
30-04-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Start UG medical classes for next academic year, says MUHS||Amid constant delays that has plagued the undergraduate (UG) medical education system in the state, the Maharashtra University of Health Sciences (MUHS) has informed all affiliated colleges to not waste time any further. In a circular released late on Wednesday, the university has asked all colleges to start conducting academic activities from the next academic year, even though final exams for the second and third-year batches are yet to be conducted for the current academic year. “It is notified that all colleges continue academic activities by optimum utilisation of various learning resources available so that there is no academic loss to students and their syllabus is completed,” states MUHS circular. It further stated that attendance of students will be maintained by colleges as per guidelines previously released circulars by the university.The dean and principals of colleges have been directed to ensure strict compliance of Covid-19 safety protocols while conducting academic activities. “Teaching schedule of the next academic year should continue uninterrupted, as these students are carried over to the next academic year, irrespective of the exam results,” said the MUHS circular, signed by the registrar.Usually scheduled to take place in the month of December-January, the second and third-year MBBS exams were postponed three times this year due to surge in Covid-19 cases recorded across the state. As per the state government, these exams will now be conducted in the first week of June. However, holding off classes for the next academic year until exams are completed will leave students with very little academic time for the next year.“While second-year batches begin in the month of June, third and fourth-year MBBS batches start their academic year in January itself. This year, since exams kept getting delayed, several colleges have already started taking lectures for the next academic year online,” said Brijesh Sutaria, parent of an MBBS student. He added that select few colleges are also conducting physical classes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-start-ug-medical-classes-for-next-academic-year-says-muhs-101619724463712.html
30-04-2021||Mumbai||Bombay HC seeks details of doctors, paramedics available in jails||The Bombay high court (HC) has asked Maharashtra prison authorities to provide details of availability of qualified medical staff and health workers in prison hospitals after it was informed of deaths of prisoners and jail staff in the second wave of Covid-19 in the state. The query was prompted after the court was informed that the Taloja Central prison had only three Ayurvedic doctors inside the jail hospital. The court further sought to know from the Centre and state as to whether having Aadhaar card was mandatory requirement for prisoners to be eligible for vaccination and also took note of suggestions by People’s Union of Civil Liberties (PUCL) to ask the state level high-power committee (HPC) to convene a meeting and decide on relaxing its guidelines further to decongest jails. The division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni, while hearing the suo motu public interest litigation (PIL) instituted after taking cognisance of a news report that the number of Covid positive cases among prisoners and jail staff had gone up from 47 to 200 in a month during the second wave, was informed by advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni that various measures had been initiated to safeguard prison inmates. He submitted that only 244 prisoners and 170 jail staff were currently undergoing treatment for Covid-19 from among the 35,000 prisoners across all jails in the state. He further submitted that school and hostel premises that had been requisitioned earlier for setting up temporary prisons were taken over again to decongest jails. He added that around 64,000 repeated and random Covid-19 tests were conducted in prisons, as a result of which there were only three deaths from among the 35,124 jail inmates and staff in the last month. The bench also asked the state about whether the jails had qualified doctors and medical staff stipulated by the Prison Rules, 2015 after it was informed that Taloja jail and hospital was being looked after by three Ayurveda doctors. The HC held that it was a serious issue and required to be attended to urgently. Senior advocate Mihir Desai for human rights’ body PUCL informed the court that after May 2020 the HPC had not convened, and hence the court should direct it to meet at the earliest to review the Covid-19 situation in prisons and current population of inmates to further decide on release of prisoners to decongest jails. With regards the Aadhaar card being mandatory for vaccination of prisoners, Prof Vijay Raghavan, member NGO Prayas and Centre for Criminology and Justice, Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS), informed the court that it was creating a huge problem for inmates and hence the bench should pass appropriate orders. The court then asked the Centre and state to respond, as the same was an important policy issue which would have pan-India ramifications. The court then observed that Aadhaar card was important for identifying persons being administered the vaccination and for maintaining a nationwide database of vaccinations, hence if non availability of Aadhaar was an issue, registration camps should be held in prisons so that all eligible prisoners get a card and also get vaccinated. Seeking responses from the authorities, HC posted further hearing to May 4.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-seeks-details-of-doctors-paramedics-available-in-jails-101619724403729.html
30-04-2021||Mumbai||T20 Mumbai tournament postponed amid rise in Covid-19 cases||A day after Board of Control for Cricket in India’s (BCCI) nod to host T20 Mumbai, the Mumbai Cricket Association (MCA) on Thursday has decided to postpone the league owing to the spike in the Covid-19 cases in the country. Milind Narvekar, the chairman of the T20 Mumbai governing council and a close aide of Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, took the decision to postpone the league in consultation with MCA president Vijay Patil. “In the view of the current situation, president Vijay Patil and I, in my capacity as the chairman, have taken the decision to not conduct the T20 Mumbai League till further notice. This is our way to reduce load on the state machinery and also making sure everyone is safe,” said Narvekar, who is also one of the secretaries of Shiv Sena. He added: “I spoke to Vijay Patil and he supported my decision, which is a right one, looking at the current circumstances.” Later, MCA issued a statement regarding deferring the third edition of the tournament. “In the view of the current Covid-19 pandemic situation in the country and keeping in mind the safety and interest of all the stakeholders involved, the Mumbai Cricket Association has decided to defer the conduct of third edition of the T20 Mumbai League till further notice,” read the statement which was signed by Narvekar and Patil. On Wednesday, BCCI had bent its own rule to allow four associations to organise their respective T20 leagues after IPL concludes. According to BCCI’s rules, local T20 tournaments cannot be held 15 days before or after IPL, and also between September 15 and end of February, as BCCI’s domestic tournaments are held during this period. In an email to the state associations, BCCI interim chief executive officer (CEO) Hemang Amin stated: “Your request for organising the tournament falls within the 15-day period after the IPL 2021. The issue was discussed at the apex council meeting of the BCCI and after some deliberations it was decided that owing to the current Covid-19 pandemic situation, the BCCI is giving permission to organise the tournament within the 15-day period after the completion of IPL 2021.” The mail added: “The BCCI is pleased to grant you approval to organise the tournament for the year 2021. You are instructed to adhere to the advisory and guidelines issued by BCCI in this regard. We reiterate that this is a one-time permission provided due to the pandemic situation and is not the norm,” the BCCI official wrote. Besides the MCA, the other associations who have been given permission are Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Saurashtra. The Tamil Nadu Premier League (TNPL) schedule was released later in the day. The tournament will be held from June 4 to July 4. MCA had applied for permission long ago, when the Covid-19 situation was under control in the city. According to sources, MCA was planning to start the tournament by June 4, provided the Covid-19 situation in the city was under control. The plan was to follow the bio-secure bubble protocols that were in place during the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy, Vijay Hazare Trophy and IPL.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/t20-mumbai-tournament-postponed-amid-rise-in-covid-19-cases-101619724343707.html
30-04-2021||Mumbai||Country will have to adopt Maharashtra model to fight Covid: Sanjay Raut||Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut on Thursday said the country will have to adopt ‘Maharashtra model’ to fight the Covid-19 pandemic. The Sena MP said the people in the country are not getting guidance from those in power. He further said that chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray has been demanding that the Prime Minister (PM) notify the pandemic as a natural calamity — the line now adopted by the Supreme Court.The Sena leader said that though attempts were made to defame the state for its handling of Covid-19, the Maharashtra model will have to be adopted by all. “People are in a state of panic and shock, they do not know what is happening; they are not given proper guidance. The manner in which the Maharashtra government and its administration is working, the country will have to follow the Maharashtra model. You tried hard to defame Maharashtra [over handling Covid-19] but if there is a place where the best work is taking place in the times of Covid-19, it is in Maharashtra,” Raut said. Earlier this month, CM Thackeray wrote to PM Narendra Modi that the Centre should declare it a natural calamity so that the state can access funds from the State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF). Raut said the situation in the country is dreadful and there is no guidance from the top [Centre], while the Thackeray government is steering the situation well.Raut said that Thackeray was the first to demand that the pandemic be called a natural calamity. “Today even the courts are backing it. Looking at the situation today, it is a national calamity. We are indebted to the Supreme Court, but chief minister has been telling this to the PM and home minister to declare it a natural calamity,” he said. “The courts and the Supreme Court have now become active [on Covid]. It seems like Covid-19 has reached their homes and courts. I consider the concern of the courts legitimate. The manner in which the courts are now active, it will definitely help the country,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/country-will-have-to-adopt-maharashtra-model-to-fight-covid-sanjay-raut-101619724283651.html
30-04-2021||Chandigarh||8 ventilators gathering dust at Mohali civil hospital||At a time when a Covid patient died while waiting for an ICU bed at a private hospital in Mohali on Wednesday, eight ventilators are lying unused at the civil hospital in Phase 6 for the past eight months.Reason: There is no infrastructure or staff to operate them. The district, which has emerged as a medical hub, has around 30 private hospitals with 256 ICU beds. None of the nine government facilities offers one, even as the Mohali assembly constituency is represented by the Punjab health minister.Dr Adarshpal Kaur, civil surgeon, Mohali said: “We bought eight ventilators a few months back, but don’t have the infrastructure and manpower to make them functional.” The hospital needs permanent anaesthetic personnel besides other facilities, for which a request has been made to the health department, she said. The civil hospital has recently been converted into a dedicated Covid-19 facility with 100 oxygen beds. Among other government hospitals in the district, only the Dhakoli civil hospital is attending to Covid-19 patients, and critical cases are being referred to Rajindra Hospital in Patiala, which is also stretched to the limit. “Though Rajindra Hospital is full, we are increasing its capacity,” said Dr GB Singh, director health, Punjab. Health minister Balbir Singh Sidhu said: “We will be soon making the medical college in Mohali operational with all the facilities. We are trying to have some ICU beds in government hospitals too.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/8-ventilators-gathering-dust-at-mohali-civil-hospital-101619724224293.html

Tendulkar took to Twitter to praise the initiative. “The second wave of Covid has put our healthcare system under immense pressure. Providing oxygen for the large number of serious Covid patients is the need of the hour. It is heartening to see how people are rising to the occasion. A group of 250 young entrepreneurs have launched Mission Oxygen to raise funds for importing oxygen concentrators and donating them to hospitals across the country,” the cricketer posted. “I’ve helped by contributing to the cause and hope that their effort soon reaches out to many more hospitals across India. Today, we have to stand together behind everyone that is working hard to fight this pandemic,” he added.Tendulkar has also pledged to donate plasma once he is eligible. He tested positive for Covid-19 on March 27 and was hospitalised on April 2 as a precautionary measure. Last March, he had contributed ₹25 lakh each to Prime Minister’s Relief Fund and Chief Minister’s Relief Fund in the fight against Covid-19. IPL franchises Rajasthan Royals and Delhi Capitals also contributed ₹7.5 crore and ₹1.5 crore, respectively, to the fight against the pandemic. Kolkata Knight Riders pacer Pat Cummins has donated USD 50,000 to purchase oxygen supplies for Indian hospitals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/sachin-tendulkar-donates-1-crore-to-procure-oxygen-concentrators-101619724163612.html

These passengers have been transferred to the Covid care centres for treatment. GRP commissioner Quaiser Khalid said passengers alighting from trains coming from Kerala, Rajasthan, Goa, Delhi and the National Capital Region are being screened for their temperature and a Covid-19 test is being conducted at the railway stations. He added that each day, they have found at least 30 Covid-19 patients on outstation trains entering Mumbai. “Once a Covid-19 patient is found, we immediately transfer the passenger to a Covid care centre and call all the passengers who were in the patient’s bogie to get themselves tested,” said Khalid. Meanwhile, with the recent lockdown again creating panic among migrant labourers, resulting in crowding at railway stations across the city to go back to their native states, the railway police force and the state government have taken a host of measures to ensure that Covid-19 protocols are followed without creating a chaos like last year. According to Khalid, unlike last year, they are well-prepared to handle the crowds and making sure that the migrant labourers do not create a ruckus. Khalid said they have taken a few measures to accommodate all at migrants at Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus, Lokmanya Tilak Terminus, Bandra and Thane stations. Khalid said no one was being allowed inside the railway platforms without a ticket. The RPF and GRP personnel are posted on all the entry and exit points of railway stations to ensure that ticketless travellers do not enter the premises and crowd the platforms, and thereby increase the chance of transmitting the virus. Khalid said valid ticket holders are allowed on platforms only two hours before the train arrival to reduce the crowd in railway premises and to facilitate social distancing. GRP has converted several parking areas outside long-distance train stations into waiting areas for traveling migrants and to ensure Covid-appropriate behaviour, said the officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/grp-find-450-covid-positive-passengers-on-outstation-trains-to-mumbai-in-15-days-101619724164218.html
30-04-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra: False claims of oxygen sufficiency, Remdesivir diverted in Nandurbar, alleges BJP MP||Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) member of Parliament from Nandurbar Dr Heena Gavit has alleged that district administration had diverted Remdesivir injections to an organisation related to Shiv Sena’s local leader Chandrakant Raghuvanshi. She has also said that the district administration made false claims of its self-sufficiency related to oxygen in the district.“District collector had claimed that the district had become self-sufficient after they installed oxygen plants in the district recently. However, in reality, the plants in Navapur and Taloda plants have not yet been commissioned. Even half of its required oxygen is not generated in the district as yet,” Dr Gavit said.She also accused that the district administration diverted 1,000 Remdesivir injections to Rotary Welfare Centre, the organisation associated with Sena leader Chandrakant Raghuvanshi. She said that the injections were sold by the organisation illegally as such a sale has been banned.Raghvanshi, however, has termed the allegations politically motivated and said to have levelled out of political one-upmanship. “The welfare centre is empanelled by the state government and injections were sold at ₹550, when its price in the open market was much high. The sale by private establishments was banned on April 16, while our procurement from the government machinery was done on April 6. The allegations are politically motivated as the district collector did not accept a few of her proposals recently,” he said.District collector Rajendra Bharud did not respond to calls and messages.An officer from the collectorate said, “We have commissioned four plants at Shahada and Nandurbar with the capacity of 60 litres per minute, two plants in Taloda and Navapur will soon be commissioned. We have indeed been procuring oxygen from outside, but we will soon be self-sufficient once all plants are commissioned. We never claimed that we have already been generating the oxygen we require. But the new plants under construction were planned after the outbreak of the second wave.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtrafalse-claims-of-oxygen-sufficiency-remdesivir-diverted-in-nandurbar-alleges-bjp-mp-101619724103696.html
30-04-2021||Mumbai||NMC directs all medical colleges to set up PSA oxygen units in 6 months||In view of hospitals across the country struggling with oxygen shortage amid rising Covid-19 cases, the National Medical Commission (NMC) has made draft amendments to their existing rules, making it compulsory for medical college hospitals to set up pressure swing adsorption (PSA) oxygen units in their campuses. As per the latest circular released by NMC, the arrangements have to be made within the next six months. Addressed to all affiliated medical institutions in the country, NMC revealed that this move was being introduced through a draft amendment made to the Minimum Requirements for Annual MBBS Admissions Regulations. “Central oxygen and suction points shall include provision of piped oxygen supply to all patients in critical care from liquid oxygen tanks installed in appropriate place in the hospital complex,” stated the circular released on April 28. It further stated that all medical college hospitals should have a dedicated PSA technology-based oxygen supply in addition to supply from liquid oxygen tanks, which is to be installed and made operational within six months.The move comes days after the Central government recently asked respective state governments to make captive oxygen a norm in medical colleges in the future. At present, Maharashtra has more than 60 medical colleges offering undergraduate medical programmes.“Most medical colleges in the state already have an oxygen generation unit on campus and we are now going to make sure that all colleges install the PSA technology for future needs,” said TP Lahane, director of the state Directorate of Medical Education and Research (DMER). “This is a move made by NMC to ensure infrastructural upgradation of medical colleges. Basic facilities are anyway available in most medical colleges, but encouraging them to adopt better technology is the need of the hour,” said Dr Avinash Supe, former dean and director of KEM Hospital. Supe, who is at present in-charge of Covid-death committee in the state, added, “Over the past few years, the apex body has tried to encourage colleges to be better equipped. With the current scenario, when oxygen shortage is plaguing the system, the aim is to make sure hospitals are better prepared for the future.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/nmc-directs-all-medical-colleges-to-set-up-psa-oxygen-units-in-6-months-101619724104230.html
30-04-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai’s test positivity rate is coming down. What does it mean?||Mumbai’s daily Covid-19 test positivity rate – the percentage of tests that are positive, or TPR – has been on a steady decline, data shows. From 30% on April 4, when the city recorded the highest single-day surge of 11,206 cases, the test positivity rate came down to 10.79% on April 29, with cases dropping to 4174. This is not an isolated case. The city’s TPR for the previous six days was respectively 12.69%, 13.19%, 13.68%, 13.75%, 14.87% and 17.26%. What does this mean for the city that was once the epicentre of the Covid pandemic in India, and was one of the worst affected cities in the second wave that began in the second week of February and peaked two months later? Simply put, TPR rises when most of the people who are getting tested are positive, and declines when most samples tested return negative. But this rate, experts say, has to be correlated to the number of tests. Trends across the pandemic show that when tests declined, the TPR went up. Mumbai was no different in the first wave that peaked in September 2020. The city averaged 11,175 tests per day that month, and the city’s TPR was almost 20%. In April, though, the number of tests has averaged more than 40,000 per day, with TPR consistently declining from the second week onwards.“A declining TPR is a good sign for Mumbai,” said Sandeep Juneja, dean of the school of technology and computer science at Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR), Mumbai. “The positivity rate goes down when the city has fewer people with Covid symptoms seeking tests. To put it simply, it means that the number of infections within the community is coming down, which is a healthy sign. It would be ideal for the TPR to drop below 5% as was the case in late January and early February.” According to Juneja, in August-September last year, Mumbai’s TPR was around 20%. “At that time, the city was carrying out only about 10,000 to 15,000 tests each day. In comparison, the number of tests has increased to nearly 40,000 now,” he said. From 30% on Sunday, April 4, the positivity rate fell to 25% the next Sunday on April 11. It further dropped to 23% on April 18 and to 19% on April 25. The state implemented curfew-like restrictions on April 14, and it announced stricter curbs on the movement of citizens on April 21. Civic officials said that before these restrictions came into place, they were widely testing people at crowded areas such as beaches, malls, gardens, etc. “Since the restrictions came into place, we are carrying out targeted testing of people who have symptoms, or those who have a train or air travel scheduled,” said a civic official. “If you see the testing figures, the numbers have not fallen drastically. At this point, the reduced TPR indicates that the infection is being controlled,” she said, adding that the government will consider easing the restrictions when the rate falls below 5%. An expert insight published by the US-based Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in August 2020 has stated that “one threshold for the percent positive being “too high” is 5%”. It said that the World Health Organization recommended in May 2020 that the percent positive remain below 5% for at least two weeks before governments consider reopening. Experts say that TPR is a more reliable indicator to ascertain whether new infections are reducing. “But interpreting it is complex,” said Dr. Om Shrivastav, member of the Maharashtra’s Covid-19 task force. “It can be well interpreted if there is consistently the same number of tests in the same geographical area or community,” he said. According to city-based infectious disease expert Dr Tanu Singhal, the lockdown-like restrictions have played a crucial role in Mumbai’s declining positivity rate. “At the same time, people have also become more cautious, and there is definitely a change in behaviour in terms of masking, physical distancing, etc,” she said, adding that the state should not rush into easing the restrictions and instead use the time to vaccinate as many people as possible and scale up health infrastructure. “We must not forget that there can always be a third wave,” said Dr Singhal. Does Covid-19 vaccination have a role to play in the declining test positivity rate? “It’s too premature to link them both,” said Dr. C Pramesh, director of the Tata Memorial Hospital who has been keenly tracking the Covid-19 trajectory. “Compared to our population, the number of vaccinations is still low and this immediate reduction in the test positivity rate cannot be attributed to it,” he said. Until April 28, Mumbai had administered over 2.4 million vaccine doses, but only around 460,000 were fully vaccinated with two doses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbais-test-positivity-rate-is-coming-down-what-does-it-mean-101619724043663.html
30-04-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra extends lockdown till May 15||Maharashtra government on Thursday formally announced the extension of lockdown for a fortnight after May 1. The state, on April 21, had restricted movement of people till May 1, but with around 60,000 Covid-19 cases being recorded daily, it extended the lockdown till May 15.On Wednesday, the state cabinet had in-principle decided to extend the lockdown. State health minister Rajesh Tope had said that all cabinet ministers had unanimously told the chief minister that the restrictions be extended by 15 days.An order issued by chief secretary Sitaram Kunte said that the state is “continued to be threatened with the spread of Covid-19, and therefore it is “imperative to continue emergency measures to prevent and contain the spread of the virus”. It said, “The government finds it is necessary to continue the enforcement of the current restrictions throughout the state beyond 7am on May 1, 2021, till 7am on May 15, 2021, to break the chain of transmission effectively.”During the lockdown, the restrictions that were imposed from April 22 will continue. These restrictions include reduced attendance in government and exempted category offices to 15%, local train travel has been restricted to the essential sector and stricter curbs have been imposed on inter-district and city travel. This would mean, people still can’t step out unless for medical reasons or to buy essential commodities (between 7am and 11am) or if they are working in the essential sector. Health experts said that the decision was anticipated as the state is yet to bring down the daily Covid-19 cases. Though, some cities including Mumbai, Pune have seen some dip in cases. Maharashtra in the last two weeks has seen a minor decrease in cases, but it could be a fluctuation and not a trend, said Dr Subhash Salunkhe, former director-general of health services (Maharashtra) and advisor to the state on Covid.According to data, a week after Maharashtra announced a lockdown from April 22, the weekly growth of Covid-19 infections has seen a dip. Between April 15 and April 21, the state recorded 387,972 cases, which came down to 378,554 between April 22 and April 28.Over the last few days, the state’s daily cases are hovering around 62,000 and 66,000. Salunkhe further said that the state could continue to see similar daily figures for another week. “The decrease in cases in some pockets could be fluctuation. Maharashtra will see similar figures for another seven days or so before we see some decrease. The restrictions on people’s movement will gradually show impact in this week and the next,” he said. Salunkhe, however, refused to comment on the state government projections for when the state will go past the second wave. “In the last wave, we have had a bad experience with these mathematical models. Nobody can fully predict the extent, but the state has geared up well,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-extends-lockdown-till-may-15-101619723983700.html
30-04-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra: 19 Oxygen Express trains kept on standby||The Railways has kept 19 freight trains on standby at different locations for transportation of oxygen, if needed, to Maharashtra, officials said on Thursday. The trains will be used if the Maharashtra government wants to ferry liquid oxygen from any location outside the state. Nineteen Roll-On Roll-Off (RORO) freight trains with a capacity to attach 32 flat wagons, on which tankers can be loaded, are standby. Of these, two trains are at standby at Kalamboli in Navi Mumbai, seven trains at Nagpur railway station and 10 at Pune railway station. Railways are operating oxygen express as per the demand from the state government. Both the Central and Western Railway have operated one Oxygen Express each carrying nearly 149 tonnes of medical oxygen to Maharashtra. “We have kept RORO on standby and will be operating it as the state government demands for it. We have not yet received requirements for operation of another Oxygen Express yet. The flat wagons will be deployed as we get demand from the state government,” said a senior railway official. Ten tankers carrying oxygen were sent to Maharashtra from Gujarat and Visakhapatnam. RORO service movement on Central Railway is challenging due to the ghat section and takes time as trains with the oxygen tankers cannot be transported from the ghat section. The route of the train is decided after evaluating the ghat areas, road overbridges (RoB), tunnels, curves, platform canopies and over-head equipment (OHE).The first Oxygen Express departed from Kalamboli railway yard to steel plant in Visakhapatnam on April 19 and reached Maharashtra on April 24.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-19-oxygen-express-trains-kept-on-standby-101619723923644.html
30-04-2021||Mumbai||IIT-Bombay converts existing nitrogen plant into oxygen generator||At a time when there’s a shortage of medical oxygen supply in the country for treatment of Covid-19 patients, the Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay (IIT-B), has set up a demonstration unit to convert nitrogen generators, which are found in all parts of India, into oxygen generators by fine-tuning the existing nitrogen plant set up. The oxygen generated by this plant at IIT-B lab was tested and found to be 93-96% pure and at 3.5 atmospheric pressure. Nitrogen generation plants, which take in air from the atmosphere and separate oxygen and nitrogen to give out liquid nitrogen, can be found in various industries such as oil and gas, food and beverages. Nitrogen is dry in nature and is used commonly for purging and cleaning of oil and gas tankers. Milind Atrey, institute chair professor, department of mechanical engineering, IIT-B, along with Tata Consulting Engineers Limited (TCE), demonstrated a proof of concept of quickly converting nitrogen plants into oxygen plants. Nitrogen plants work on pressure swing adsorption (PSA) technology, where air from the atmosphere is sucked in, filtered of impurities and nitrogen is extracted. Oxygen, which is a by-product, is released back into the atmosphere. A nitrogen plant has four components — a compressor to control the pressure of the air sucked in, an air vessel for filtering out impurities, PSU units where the separation takes place, and a buffer vessel into which this separated nitrogen is passed and stored. Atrey and the team from TCE propose to switch the filter used for nitrogen extraction in the PSA unit with one that can extract oxygen instead. “In nitrogen plants, the pressure of the air is controlled and then it is cleaned of impurities such as water vapours, oil, carbon dioxide and hydrocarbons. After this step, the purified air goes into the PSA chamber which is fitted with carbon molecular sieves or filters that can separate nitrogen and oxygen. We are proposing that the sieves be replaced with ones that can separate oxygen instead,” said Atrey, a specialist in cryogenic engineering and dean, research and development at IIT-B. The team replaced the carbon molecular sieves with zeolite molecular sieves in the PSA Nitrogen plant in the Refrigeration and Cryogenics Laboratory of the institute. Zeolite molecular sieves are used for separating oxygen from the air. By controlling the flow rates of the containers, the researchers were able to convert the nitrogen plant into an oxygen generating plant. Spantech Engineers, a city-based company that deals with PSA Nitrogen and Oxygen plant production, partnered on this pilot project and installed the required plant components as a skid at IIT-B for evaluation. The pilot project was aimed at finding quick and easy solutions to the severe oxygen shortage in medical facilities across the country. Amit Sharma, managing director of TCE, said, “This pilot displays how an innovative solution for emergency oxygen generation using existing infrastructure can help the country tide over the current crisis.” “It took us about three days to do the conversion. It is a simple process and can be done quickly within a few days. Nitrogen plants across the country can use this technique to convert their plants into oxygen plants,” said Atrey. Announced on Thursday morning, the pilot study has gained the attention of many policymakers. “We have received interest from many government officials, not only in Maharashtra but from across the country, on how this can be scaled up and implemented in existing nitrogen plants. We are currently streamlining our processes to help existing plants in adopting this model,” Atrey added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/iitbombay-converts-existing-nitrogen-plant-into-oxygen-generator-101619723864256.html

30-04-2021||Mumbai||Nagpur doesn’t get Remdesivir: Bombay HC seeks details on distribution||Even with more than 78,000 active Covid cases, Nagpur district did not receive any Remdesivir on Wednesday while, Jalna, state health minister Rajesh Tope’s home district, received 30,000 vials of the antiviral drug. The district has 7,800 active cases. These figures were presented before the Nagpur bench of the Bombay high court (HC) on Thursday, following which the bench directed the nodal officer to place on record district-wise allocation of Remdesivir and the formula adopted to determine the entitlement of each district. “In case he finds that more number of vials than what should have been sent to a particular district have been sent, the nodal officer shall withdraw the same from that district proportionately and send them to the districts which have been unjustly and unequally deprived of these vials, and this would include Nagpur as well,” the HC said while seeking compliance by Friday afternoon. A division bench consisting justice Sunil Shukre and justice Avinash Gharote, while hearing a suo motu public interest litigation (PIL) on Covid mismanagement, asked the nodal officer (Food and Drugs Administration joint commissioner Ganesh Rokde) to place on record corrective action and effective steps taken to remove this step-motherly treatment. The Centre had allotted 269,000 Remdesivir vials for Maharashtra for April 21-30 and the quota was enhanced to 435,000 on April 24. Considering active cases, Nagpur district should have received 49,177 vials during the period, but got only a fraction of it, pointed out amicus curiae Shreerang Bhandarkar, and Indian Medical Association’s counsel Advocate Bhanudas Kulkarni. Meanwhile, Jalna district received 30,000 vials of Remdesivir from one or two pharmaceutical companies, they said. On couple of days including April 28 Nagpur district received no vials making situation quite precarious, informed advocate Tushar Mandlekar. When the state, through in-charge government pleader Ketaki Joshi, sought some time to furnish the detailed affidavit pursuant to last order, the HC sought to know whether any district-wise allotment order was passed by the nodal officer to ensure fair and equitable distribution of Remdesivir. The state said the nodal officer has not passed any such order and added that there was no need for the same, promising to justify this position on Friday. The court then asked the state and the nodal officer to explain how Remdesivir was being distributed, and list backlog of vials from Pharmaceutical companies and steps taken pursuant to allotment of quota by the central committee to procure the quantity from seven pharmaceutical companies by Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/nagpur-doesn-t-get-remdesivir-bombay-hc-seeks-details-on-distribution-101619723743620.html

30-04-2021||Chandigarh||Vax drive for 18+ likely to get delayed in Chandigarh||The Covid vaccination programme in Chandigarh for the 18-plus age group is unlikely to begin on May 1 due to the unavailability of vaccines, officials said. UT had sought permission from the Centre to allow administering the available doses to the new group for which confirmation is awaited. Meanwhile, there is no clarity on when UT will receive doses from the vaccine manufacturers. Chandigarh administration has placed the order for 1 lakh doses for the new age group.This leaves Chandigarh with no immediate supply to roll out the drive even though registrations have opened, creating confusion among the people looking forward to taking the jab.UT adviser Manoj Parida said starting the drive from May 1 may not be possible due to current constraints of vaccine unavailability. “But, as soon as we find the way out regarding the availability of vaccines, either through our purchase or Centre’s confirmation, we will roll out the programme. I have written to the Centre to allow Chandigarh to use the vaccines from the existing stock,” Parida said. UT health secretary Arun Gupta said there is no stock for the new age group due to which the spots are not opened on the CoWIN platform.“We have placed an order and as soon we receive the supply, the vaccines will be provided. So far, there are less chances that there will be a roll out from May 1,” he added.Chandigarh has so far received 2,90,930 doses of vaccines out of which, 2,03,082 have been used, including the 3.46% wastage, leaving around 87,000 unutilized doses. According to CoWIN portal, as many as 2,01,806 doses have been administered. Of the beneficiaries, 1,55,589 have taken the first dose and 46,217 have taken both the shots. This leaves Chandigarh with around 1.55 lakh people to be administered with the second dose.Private hospitals in Chandigarh have said that they are not opening booking slots for new group due to confusion over the availability of vaccines. Till now, the UT administration has provided vaccines to them, but this time there is no assurance regarding the supply for new age group included in the drive. While even a few private hospitals directly tried to purchase the doses from the Serum Institute of India, the vaccine manufacturer in a communication told them that to procure the same from state authorities due to huge demand from the Centre. “We haven’t received any communication from the UT health authorities on how to proceed. There re no standard procedures on how will we get supplies and what should be our capacity. Even though we are receiving many calls for bookings, we are not doing so as there is no clarity,” said Dr Neeraj Kumar, managing director of Chaitanya Hospital. BJP: Give free vaccines to people in 18-44 bracketThe Bharatiya Janata Party, Chandigarh, has demanded that the vaccination of people in 18 to 44 age group should be done free of cost in the city. City BJP chief Arun Sood in a letter to UT administrator VP Singh Badnore has asked free vaccination on the pattern of Punjab and Haryana. He said that on Wednesday, a resolution was also passed in the BJP-ruled MC House that the administration should also use the amount of ₹27 crore collected as Covid cess. “If the administration decides to vaccinate free of cost, this will provide a great relief to the people of Chandigarh,” Sood said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/vax-drive-for-18-likely-to-get-delayed-in-chandigarh-101619723264020.html

The university has written to seven district administrations seeking permission for gathering of more than 10 people at the polling booths. The varsity has also requested the administrations to facilitate the movement of polling parties from Chandigarh to respective polling stations on May 2 and their return on May 3.The communication has been sent to Fazilka, Ferozepur, Hoshiarpur, Ludhiana, Muktsar, Moga and Nawanshahr. The contestants of both the constituencies have been informed about the development. For both the constituencies, 28 polling booths each will be set up.According to Covid-19 guidelines issued by Punjab government earlier this month, prior approval of the district administration is needed for all gatherings of more than 10 persons.According to the communication issued by the varsity to contestants on Thursday, the election scheduled on Monday will be subject to the approval of district administrations from Punjab.The university has already deferred the election of six members for PU senate from faculties’ constituencies to May 19, which was earlier scheduled to be held on April 26.Who are the candidatesTen candidates from both the constituencies are in fray, which have over 800 eligible voters. Three members are elected to PU senate from the constituency of principals of technical and professional colleges, for which there are five candidates, including Neetu Ohri, principal, Guru Nanak College of Education, Malerkotla Road, Ludhiana and Sandeep Kataria, principal, Saint Sahara College of Education, Ferozepur Road, Muktsar.The other three candidates are Sarabjit Kaur, principal, Guru Ram Dass BEd College, Jalalabad (W), Fazilka; Savita Kansal, principal, Brahmrishi Yoga Training College, Sector 19 A, Chandigarh and Tarlok Bandhu, principal, Khalsa College of Education, Muktsar.For the election of three members to PU senate from the constituency of staff of technical and professional colleges, the candidates include Gurmit Singh, who is an assistant professor at Malwa Central College of Education for Women, Ludhiana and Neeru Malik, assistant professor, Dev Samaj College of Education, Sector 36-B, Chandigarh, among others.The senate is a 91-member apex governing body of Panjab University in which 47 members are elected from various constituencies. The four-year term of senate ended on October 31 last year. While the elections were scheduled to start in August last year, these were postponed twice by V-C Raj Kumar due to the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/pu-seeks-permission-from-7-punjab-districts-for-senate-polls-101619723144557.html
30-04-2021||Chandigarh||Panchkula earmarks 6 more sites for last rites of Covid victims||As Panchkula ran out of space to cremate its dead amid the spiralling Covid fatalities, the authorities have increased the number of sites dedicated to cremating such bodies to seven.Last week, the crematorium in Sector 20, which also houses a gas-based facility, was earmarked for the same purpose. For the first time, the crematorium was full on Wednesday, while Thursday saw 13 cremations.Panchkula municipal commissioner RK Singh ordered to designate the cremation ground in Sector 28, burial ground in Sector 28, cremation ground in Ramgarh, crematoriums in Rambagh, Kalka and burial grounds in Majra Mehtab and Himshikha for the cremation of bodies of Covid victims.“We have 14 plots, which means 14 bodies can be cremated here in a day. Today, there were 32 bodies,” a worker at Sector-20 crematorium said.He said that the death toll has spiked in the last few weeks. “Last year, the weekly figure used to stand at one or two, but now, there is no counting. We have bodies on a waiting list. I have never seen such a scenario in last two decades.”As per the data, Sector-20 crematorium handled at least 179 bodies in April. Of these, 73 were of Panchkula residents, who succumbed to Covid. The number mentioned in the media bulletin shared by the health department is far less – 47. The gap in the figures existed in March as well, when the department claimed five people died due to Covid, whereas crematorium showed 15 deaths.Overwhelming scenes at sitesBy noon on Thursday, a municipal staffer had cremated six bodies. “Eight more will be cremated here today, and then I will go to the cremation ground in Sector 28.”The staff member, who has three workers to help him, said he has requested for two more teams for the task as the number of bodies has increased manifold.Families, meanwhile, could be seen scrambling to arrange items to perform the last rites of their loved ones. As an ambulance with four more bodies reached the Sector-20 crematorium later in the day, one of the workers asked a family to hurry up as more bodies were lined up.Kin of the dead were also left disappointed when their request of collecting the remains the next day was not met. As per the official, they can’t handle such requests as they have to make arrangements for the cremations about the take place the next day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/panchkula-earmarks-6-more-sites-for-last-rites-of-covid-victims-101619723089791.html

School heads stated that the food grains must be given to the students soon, as may get damaged if they are stored for a long period of time.As per sources, 8,174.94 metric tonnes (MT) of food grains were delivered to schools across the state by Punjab State Civil Supplies Corporation Limited (PUNSUP), in mid-March. Out of this, 1,206 MT was sent to Ludhiana, after which the schools were closed down.At Government Model Senior Secondary Smart School, Punjab Agricultural University, more than 50 bags of wheat and rice are stored in two rooms. The school has around 1,887 students in Classes 1 to 8.A government Primary school, which has a strength of 100 students, has three quintals each of rice and wheat stored in the mid-day meal kitchen.School authorities said they have received the cooking cost of the meals from the state education department, which has been transferred in the accounts of the students. Many students do not have bank accounts and they have been given cheques.The school head of a primary school, requesting anonymity, said, “We have 500 students in the school studying in Classes 1 to 5 and we have 30 quintals each of rice and wheat lying in the midday meal kitchen. The food grains will get damaged as they have been stored for the last one month.”Sanjeev Thapar, principal of GMSSS, PAU, said, “We have transferred the cooking cost to the bank accounts of students and till mid-March, cooks had been preparing meals daily. After the schools got closed, we received no instructions from the higher authorities to hand over the food grains to students. Last year, we made packets of grains and gave it to students.”Prabcharan Singh, general manager of the state MDM cell, Mohali, said, “We have received no orders from the Union government to get packets of food grains delivered to the childrens’ homes like last year. Once we receive it, we will direct school heads to do the needful. The cooking cost has been transferred to the bank accounts of thebeneficiaries.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/food-grains-for-midday-meals-gathering-dust-at-ludhiana-govt-schools-101619723088623.html

However, a complaint regarding the same was filed two days later on April 21.During the visit, the police team questioned the staff and the lone security guard that was deployed at the museum when the theft had come to light. The cops also quizzed the PAU authorities about its “poor” security measures and absence of CCTV cameras at the museum.Joint police chief Pareek said that the investigation was being carried out with all seriousness. “There have been lapses on the part of the security of the museum. However, police are taking necessary action and efforts are on to nab the thieves,” he said.The theft had taken place when the varsity was closed for outsiders and entry was allowed only from one point, Gate Number 4. PAU officials had found out about the theft on April 19 when the varsity reopened. They, however, waited for two days before filing a complaint on April 21.On April 26, police had apprehended a youth, who was said to be the son of a Class 4 employee working at the varsity. They had recovered two brass plates from him, but the university authorities said the recovered articles did not belong to the museum.According to university officials, the stolen items were antique and some of these were centuries-old artwork depicting life in rural Punjab. These included bells, brass utensils, traditional jewellery, such as Rani haar (necklace), earrings, anklets and phulkari.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/burglary-of-artefacts-at-pau-ludhiana-police-return-to-museum-for-fresh-probe-101619722904960.html

The war room was set up on April 21 after complaints regarding shortage and black marketing of oxygen and remdesivir began pouring in from across the state. Even though relatives of Covid-19 patients and hospitals continue to highlight shortage of injections, officials at the war room say differently.A senior doctor supervising the war room, on condition of anonymity, said the large volume of calls is coming from the private sector. “There are three ways of getting remdesivir. First, it is given to patients admitted in private hospitals; second, patients admitted in private hospitals taken over by the government; and third through the prescription of private hospital or a doctor,” explained the official.He said the total demand for remdesivir in government hospitals and private hospital beds taken over by the government is around 5,000-6,000 vials a day. “These beds cover at least 85% of the state’s demand, as per our calculations, since most Covid-19 cases come through the government agencies that control 80% of hospital beds. While the demand from the government-run agencies is around 5,000 to 6,000, in the private sector, which is around 15% of the demand, we get up to 20,000 calls per day,” he added.While acknowledging that there is a shortage of the medicine, the doctor in-charge pointed to setting in of fear psychosis. “We need to understand that remdesivir is not a lifesaving drug. It should be administered to those who are in the moderate category. Remdesivir is an antiviral drug and works by interrupting the production of the virus and helps by preventing the virus from multiplying. But because of the increase in the number of cases or perhaps for ‘not taking a chance’, clinics and private hospitals have been prescribing the injection for most patients,” he added.On the lower demand in government hospitals, he said the doctors at the hospitals are prescribing remdesivir only to those who will benefit from the injection. He added that since the injection has been prescribed for cases that do not require it, the demand was high.The war room in-charge also said that a website was in the works to have a transparent distribution of remdesivir. He said that the website will contain details of patients who have been given the injections and details of the medical conditions.Private hospitals, however, allege that despite setting up of the war room, the supply of the injection is not adequate. An administrator of a private hospital in Bengaluru said they were only getting 30-50 doses, even though their requirement is for 100 doses. “More importantly, many calls to the helpline go unanswered,” he added.Dr HM Prasanna, president, PHANA, said that while all Covid-19 patients referred to by BBMP to private hospitals were getting the antiviral drug, supply to private hospitals remained inadequate. “We are not using the injection on all patients. We are clearly demarking them for those with moderate symptoms so that viral load reduces in these patients. But war room doesn’t find important to provide private hospitals with enough doses,” he said.Karnataka health minister Dr K Sudhakar, on Monday, said the state has ordered 70,000 vials of remdesivir injection, of which 20,000 had arrived while the remaining would be supplied in the coming days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/50-people-20k-calls-a-day-inside-the-remdesivir-war-room-in-bluru-101619722303533.html

Waste collectors, employed with various dry waste management centres of the civic body, who have to comb through tonnes of dry waste to recycling centres, claim they find at least 1,000-2,000 used masks every day. Besides demanding better protective gear, these frontline workers in Bengaluru also appealed to residents to segregate waste at home and dispose of medical waste separately. On Thursday morning, segregation work was in full swing at the waste segregation centre in Bengaluru’s JP Nagar. “Our job is to go through the waste and find items that can be recycled…While segregating waste, we come across lots of used facemasks,” said Srinivas, a waste segregator at the centre. Geetha, another segregator at the centre, said that even though they wear gloves and masks, but given the spike in Covid-19 cases across the city, they fear for their health. “We hear a lot of things. The virus in the second wave is much more powerful and spread faster. We also hear that wearing just one mask is not enough. So, there is a fear,” she said. Mansoor, the supervisor of the centre, said that compared to the first wave, the number of masks in waste they collect has not increased. “Maybe people are using more reusable masks compared to disposable ones. But people are still not segregating. Ever since the pandemic started, we have been appealing to people to put medical waste in a separate cover,” he said. Mansoor added that with more people getting treatment at home, the medical waste coming from the house pose a bigger threat to those working at the segregation centres. “It (medical waste) should be wrapped in paper. People should now segregate three kinds of waste – wet waste, dry waste, and sanitary waste; and masks should be thrown in sanitary waste,” Mansoor said. Meanwhile, on Wednesday, pourakarmikas (civic workers) in Bengaluru staged a protest, demanding protective gears like masks and gloves. They alleged that for the past nine months, they have not been issued any masks or gloves. In a letter to the commissioner of Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP), BBMP Civic Workers’ Union demanded gloves, sanitiser and shoes for workers. “We are working in these times without facilities. We also humans, just like you,” said Rathna, a civic worker, in a statement to the media. “We have been working for many years and despite the Covid (pandemic), we continue to work. But we haven’t received any of the facilities that we should have. The last time we got masks and gloves was last year. We have been asking for three weeks but we still haven’t been given masks and gloves,” she added. They also demanded that transportation facilities should be provided to them since a lockdown is in effect.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/used-masks-in-garbage-pose-threat-to-waste-collectors-101619722243487.html

The court also directed officials of the Southwestern Railway and the armed forces to meet senior officials of the state government in order to ensure that beds are available for Covid-19 patients in the state. The court also asked the state government to immediately write to the Centre, requesting an increase in allocation of remdesivir and oxygen. It also directed the central government to immediately take a decision on the request since there is a spike in the number of cases in the state.“We direct the central government to consider the request of the state govt to increase oxygen allocation. We direct the Centre to take immediate decision on the same. We direct the state to submit a representation to the concerned authority of the Centre setting out the projected requirement of oxygen for seven days from tomorrow,” said the bench led by Chief Justice AS Oka. The HC also asked the Centre to increase the cap on the supply of remdesivir. “We direct the state to place on record criteria laid down to restrict the supply of Remdesivir to private hospitals. We direct the state government to estimate the number of Remdesivir vials required in private hospitals as well 50% reserved beds and submit it to the central government accordingly,” the bench said. The HC also asked the state and BBMP to place on record the steps taken to estimate beds for the near future and increase the capacity of all hospitals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/hcasks-civic-body-to-take-300-oxygen-beds-from-southwestern-railway-101619722184129.html

Chief Minister directed to ensure judicious usage of oxygenated beds, ventilators and remdisivir, which should be given only to the needy,” the CMO said in a statement.Ashok said that around ₹266 crore was released to districts other than Bengaluru to pay salaries and buy any equipment required to tackle the Covid situation.While Bengaluru remains the most impacted region in the state, and one of the worst hit in India, the situation continues to deteriorate in other parts of Karnataka.On Thursday, there were 1,129 new infections in Bengaluru Rural, 1,175 in Dakshina Kannada, 939 in Mandya, 957 in Kalaburagi, 1,219 in Mysuru and 1,195 in Tumakuru, according to the daily bulletin of the state health department. Haveri, about 332 km from Bengaluru, reported the lowest number of cases with 111, data shows.Karnataka has imposed lockdown-like restrictions for 14 days, scheduled to end on May 12 as a last-ditch attempt to bring down the surge and pressure on the already inadequate healthcare infrastructure in the state.“Even after the 14-day curfew, people’s movement has not come down. The corona chain has to be cut and if it does not happen… then we might have to extend it for a few more days,” Ashok said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ktaka-ministers-to-donate-1-yr-salary-for-covid-relief-101619722183451.html
30-04-2021||Bangalore||Follow ‘syndromic approach’ to admit Covid patients: Govt||The Karnataka government on Thursday issued a circular directing hospitals to adopt a syndromic approach to admit Covid-19 patients amid increasing instances of false negative tests reports. “Syndromic approach should be complied with strictly for hospital admission and treatment of cases, to prevent further damage in the larger interest of public health,” Jawaid Akthar, additional chief secretary, health and family welfare, said in the circular, dated 28 April but released on Thursday.The order comes at a time when a large number of false negative Covid-19 test reports have resulted in denial of admission in hospitals. “Considering the increasing number of false negative reports being witnessed in both RT-PCR & RAT testing methods, it has been decided to follow a Syndromic Approach and issue Patient Numbers for hospitalisation and treatment of such cases based on the authorization of doctors,” Karnataka health, family welfare and medical education minister K Sudhakar said in a statement on Thursday.“This will help Covid-19 infected persons to get timely admission and treatment, especially those who seek treatment in government hospitals and private hospitals through SAST reference,” Sudhakar added. Bengaluru has over 237,518 active Covid-19 cases as the city reported 19,637 new infections on Thursday, including 143 fatalities, according to government data.Karnataka clocked 35,024 new cases on Thursday with 270 fatalities, taking its active case count to 349,496 and death toll to 15,306.The existing rules mandate that infected persons have a patient ID issued by district authorities or the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP, the city’s civic body) and Covid-19 positive certificates to get a hospital bed. However, after the latest directive, hospitals will have to admit patients showing Covid-19 symptoms. However, experts believe the denial of admission in hospitals is related to shortage of beds in Bengaluru. Of the total 12,739 beds allocated under government or BBMP quota in all private and public hospitals, only 3,246 remain vacant as of Thursday, according to data from the city’s civic administration.There are just 55 intensive care unit (ICU) beds and those with ventilators remaining in the city out of the available 909, data showed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/follow-syndromic-approach-to-admit-covid-patients-govt-101619722123477.html
30-04-2021||Mumbai||Param Bir Singh moves HC against Maharashtra’s enquiry orders||Former Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh has filed a fresh petition in the Bombay high court (HC), complaining about efforts to thwart the CBI probe into allegations of corruption against former Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh and also challenging the decision of the state government to entrust enquiries against him to director-general of police (DGP) Sanjay Pandey. The HC will hear the petition on May 4. Senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi mentioned the petition for urgent hearing before a bench of justices SS Shinde and Manish Pitale and informed that the petition was challenging the April 1 and April 20 orders of the state government, directing DGP Pandey to inquire whether Singh had violated provisions of the All India Service (Conduct) Rules, 1968 and to look into allegations made by police inspector Anup Dange that Singh’s brother had demanded ₹2 crore for getting him reinstated after he was suspended on disciplinary grounds. The petition also sought interim reliefs in view of his April 19 representation made to CBI in which he has alleged a criminal conspiracy and malicious attempt to thwart the preliminary inquiry ordered by the HC on April 5 to CBI to investigate into the allegations of corruption made by Singh against Deshmukh. The petition has sought a stay on the inquiry based on the April 1 and 20 order of the state till the petition is not heard and decided. After hearing the submissions, the bench refused to stay the two orders when the additional public prosecutor informed the court that Singh had not been issued any summons or show-cause notice as yet pursuant to the two orders and hence it was premature to stay the same. The court accepted the argument and in light of the urgency. posted hearing of the petition to May 4. On March 25, Param Bir Singh had approached the HC through a public interest litigation, seeking an inquiry into the corruption charges by former home minister Anil Deshmukh who had ordered police officers to collect protection money from restaurants and bar and other establishments to the tune of Rs100 crore per month. Singh had alleged that Deshmukh had called police officers Sachin Vaze, SCP Sanjay Patil and DCP Raju Bhujbal to his residence and told them to collect the said amount every month. Singh had alleged that though he was the Mumbai Police commissioner, Deshmukh had bypassed him and had directed his officers to commit cognisable offences. In light of these submissions Singh had sought an independent inquiry by CBI or any other agency into the allegations made by him against Deshmukh. After hearing all sides over a period of ten days, the HC had passed an order on April 5, directing the CBI not to register an FIR, but to conduct a preliminary inquiry and conclude it within 15 days. Thereafter it was left to the discretion of the director, CBI to decide on further course of action.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/param-bir-singh-moves-hc-against-maharashtra-s-enquiry-orders-101619721703419.html

Hearing her cries, her neighbours rushed her to a hospital, while her husband and his mother fled the spot.“The woman is critical. Her husband and mother-in-law have been booked under Sections 498-A (husband or relative of husband of a woman subjecting her to cruelty), 326 (voluntarily causing grievous hurt by dangerous weapons or means) and 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of the Indian Penal Code.

We do not want any more confrontations and deaths,” Jayakumar, who escaped the police firing that day, said.“We are the people who fought for our right to breathe clean air. The company, which made us choke, is using the pandemic(as an excuse) to open their oxygen plant. It seems suspicious to us. Our fear is that they will take this to their advantage to reopen the copper plant.”Vedantahas been accused of various irregularities in following environmental norms, leading to several public health issues due to production of toxins such as arsenic and sulphur oxides.The people in the district have been protesting ever since the company was constructed in 1994 and production was started in 1997. Two oxygen plants were commissioned in 1998 and 2004.On Tuesday, a Supreme court bench led by justice Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud said that the oxygen production unit will function on a stand-alone basis, and that Vedanta will not be allowed to access the copper and power plants in the precinct.Following the top court order, the company said it was working with experts on the logistics to dispatch oxygen to critical Covid areas and would reactivate the oxygen plant with the support of the community and employees.When contacted, Vedanta said they were awaiting necessary approvals based on the court order. “We await the formation of the oversight committee as directed by the Supreme Court and its recommendations and look forward to restoration of power to the plant in order to commence the necessary steps towards critical oxygen production,”the company said in a statement.As the protests grew on Thursday, district collector Senthil Raj tried to explain to the locals why it was important to manufacture more oxygen as the country amid the Covid surge. Raj said the production could also prove to be useful to the people of Thoothukudi in case of a shortage in the district.“Even if we are in need of oxygen due to Covid-19, isn’t it the government’s responsibility to ensure there is ample oxygen supply?” Jayakumar said. “There are so many other industries which can manufacture oxygen. Why depend on an operator which is shut?”As a precautionary measure, security was tightened in the district after protests erupted in areas such as Pandaarampatti and Puthu Theruon Wednesday. Police registered a case against 49 people under the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1987, for staging a protest.“The state government is firm in its decision in keeping the copper plant closed,” district collector Raj said. “There is no need for suspicion or fear. The permission granted is only for the oxygen plant to meet unprecedented demand for medical grade oxygen and has nothing to do with the main case. If the demand comes down after three months, the oxygen plant will be stopped and the premises will be sealed again.”Vedanta’s plea to reopen its factory and resume operations is pending in the Supreme Court. While its plea to reopen the plan was rejected by the Madras high court in August 2020, the top court had also rejected its plea to reopen the plan for a trial run in December and January.Last week, Vedanta Limited moved the top court for an urgent hearing, saying that it could produce 1,000 tonnes of oxygen if the plant was allowed to reopen and help by supplying free oxygen across the country.While the Tamil Nadu government opposed it on the grounds that it may become a law and order issue, the top court reminded the state of the growing demand for oxygen in several parts of the country. Following this, the collector conducted a public hearing in which a majority opposed the re-opening of the plant.On April 26, the government convened an all-party meeting which unanimously passed a resolution to allow the plant to temporarily re-open for the sole purpose of oxygen production. The resolution also said that the electricity would be provided by the government.Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam president M K Stalin assured to shut the plant after the oxygen demands are met if his government came to power on May 2 (election results day).Some activists, who were against the re-opening, had agreed for the state to take over the plant but the Tamil Nadu government order did not make any such mention.Vedanta, however, submitted an affidavit in the apex court, saying that the oxygen plant must be operated by its own team under possible supervision of a central government’s expert body.On the same day, the state told the Madras High Court that the plant has a production capacity of 1,050 MTs but only 35 tonnes can be used for medical purposes. Representing the state, advocate general Vijay Narayan said what is required is liquid oxygen with at least 99.4% purity for medical use while industrial oxygen is only 92% -93% pure. The state submitted that Sterlite also has to install compression and bottling plants to convert gaseous oxygen to liquid oxygen, a process that will take a minimum of six months.The top court also ordered the appointment of a committee to supervise the functioning and decide on the number of personnel allowed to run the unit. The committee would include Thoothukudi district collector, superintendent of police among other government officials, a district environmental engineer and two experts to be nominated by those aggrieved by pollution from Vedanta’s copper smelter.Vedanta informed the court that the production could start in 10 days once other logistical requirements were fulfilled and the capacity could go up to 200 metric tonne (MT) per day.The court said it understands the concerns of the local community, “...but we are looking at the national crisis where people are dying for the want of oxygen...we will have to balance everything.”Though Tamil Nadu wanted to be prioritised for oxygen use, the court directed Vedanta to supply the gas to the Centre’s pool for an equitable distribution across the country. “Nation stands together in this moment. At present, Tamil Nadu’s oxygen demands are met. In case of any future need, they can approach us for changes in the order,” it said, adding that the order is applicable till July 31.At present, Tamil Nadu uses around 350 MTs of oxygen for Covid-19 treatment.“It is likely to touch 400 MTs if active cases shoot up,” said P Umanath, director, Tamil Nadu Medical Services Corporation (TNMSC) which procures drugs, medical equipment and augments oxygen supply for the state.The state has an oxygen production capacity of 400 MT and a storage capacity of 1,167 MT. Senior officials said the empowered group’s allotment of 220 MT for Tamil Nadu is incorrect and that chief minister Edappadi Palaniswami had written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, urging the Centre to immediately cancel oxygen diversion from the state to Andhra Pradesh and Telangana which comparatively had fewer active cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/kin-of-sterlite-victims-protest-sc-govt-nods-to-reopen-plant-101619721583489.html

The ongoing vaccination drive for those above 45 years will be suspended for three days till May 2 due to shortage of vials. The civic body also appealed to citizens above 45 years of age not to crowd at vaccination centres, fearing they would get crowded after May 1 as the two groups will have different arrangements for vaccination.Follow latest updates on Covid-19 here Also, the Maharashtra government on Thursday formally announced the extension of its lockdown for a fortnight after May 1. The state on April 21 had put strict restrictions on the movement of people till May 1, but with Covid-19 cases remaining upwards of 60,000 daily, it extended the lockdown till May 15.According to BMC officials, the stock that they will have in their hand after vaccination on Friday will not be enough to keep the vaccination drive running through the weekend.Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner, BMC, said, “We have decided to suspend the vaccination drive in Mumbai for three days between April 30 and May 2. We may hardly have around 10,000 vaccine doses in our stock after Thursday. However, if we receive around 100,000 vaccine doses, we might restart the vaccination drive in the city.”Kakani added, “With this, the vaccination drive that was going to start for the age group between 18 to 44 years is also postponed. For this age group, the drive will start only when we have sufficient stock.”According to BMC officials, the stock of vaccine coming from the Central government will only be used for the age group of above 45 years, while the stock that will come from the state government will be used for the 18 to 44 years age group’s vaccination drive. As of now, there is no word from the state government when this stock will arrive since the supply is not available from vaccine manufacturers for the time being.Further, the BMC added that all proposed 227 vaccination centres for vaccination of citizens above the age of 18 years will be operational by mid-May. The BMC also appealed to citizens above the age of 45 to not crowd at vaccination centres, stating that no citizen will be deprived of the vaccine. Significantly, it has also appealed the citizens to wear double masks, while going to vaccination centres. The advisory was issued after huge crowds were reported across vaccination centres in the city on Thursday at government and civic body-run vaccination centres. The vaccination drive was to get operational only by noon on Thursday, however, citizens had started reaching vaccination centres by as early as 6am. This resulted in huge queues and crowding outside several vaccination centres in the city. The BMC said, “Citizens in the age group of 45 years and above should not have the misconception that they will not get the vaccine as vaccination has started in the age group of 18 to 44 years. Even if the scope of vaccination is increased, priority will be given to citizens aged 45 years and above.”The statement also added that from now on, those above 45 years of age will be vaccinated only they are registered on the Co-win portal.Vijay Gangan, 79, along with wife and sister had to wait in line for five hours to be administered the Covid-19 vaccine at Mahim maternity home on Thursday. Gangan said he was determined to take his first dose of vaccine any how on Thursday and was ready to be in queue till evening if needed. “On two previous occasions despite scheduling my appointment, I was sent back from the hospitals citing shortage of vaccines. Hence today I decided to come directly to the hospital,” said Gangan. Gangan and his family members stood in line from 7am and his turn came from 12 noon. Similar is the case of Lekha Salunke, 55, who was waiting in line at KEM Hospital from 9am onwards for her second dose of vaccine. “The private hospital where I took the first dose has no stock from the last one week. The situation will only deteriorate after May 1 when citizens over 18 years will also be added in the vaccination list,” said Salunke.Ashwini Bhide, additional municipal commissioner of the BMC, took to Twitter on Thursday saying, “All senior citizens in #Mumbai r kindly requested nt 2 crowd or stand in long queues @ #vaccination centres.Vaccine is in short supply just for now & so nt available @ all places in enough quantity. But be rest assured that all 45+ years citizens wil eventually get vaccinated. Even when the new drive for the 18-44 year age group starts, the centres available now will continue to remain active for 45+ years citizens.”Currently, there are 136 vaccination centres, of which 63 are government and civic centres, and in the coming days the BMC plans to make additional 227 vaccination centres operational. These centres will vaccinate all above 18 years of age for free, but in the operational 63 vaccination centres citizens only above 45 years of age will be vaccinated.According to BMC officials, they are also in the process of recruiting additional staff for the proposed 227 vaccination centres in the city. Devidas Kshirsagar, deputy municipal commissioner, BMC’s health department, said, “We are in the process of making arrangements for having 227 vaccination centres in the city. It will require three things broadly when it comes to conducting successful vaccination. This includes cold storage, health infrastructure for attending beneficiaries that might report adverse effect post immunisation followed by having sufficient nurses and doctors.” Kshirsagar added, “Every ward officer is in the process of recruiting nurses, doctors and required contractual staff. We will need around 2,000 contractual staff for running these 227 vaccination centres. We should be in a position by having all of these 227 centres operational by mid-May and after that vaccination will also start as and when doses are made available to us.”The 227 vaccination centres are proposed to be opened up in each 227 electoral wards utilising community halls, health posts and party halls. These centres will be used for vaccination and post vaccination observation, and in case of any adverse effect, the BMC will tie up with nearby nursing homes and hospitals where the citizen will be rushed to in case of any adverse effect post vaccination.For the age group for 18 to 44 years, the vaccination will only be on the basis of appointments. While the vaccine administration will be free at government and civic run centres, one will also have an option to get vaccinated by paying at private hospitals. Simultaneously, the BMC officials said they are also in touch with indigenous manufacturers directly and trying to get vaccine doses directly for the city. A BMC official not wishing to be named said, “We cannot directly procure vaccines for international manufacturers, and hence are in touch with domestic manufacturers to explore a possibility of getting any doses directly.”According to BMC officials, for now the doses that are received from the central government will only be used for 45 and above age groups. Once the fresh stock procured by the state government starts coming in, vaccination for the 18 to 44 age group will start. The city will have three vaccine cold storage facilities at Dadar, Kanjurmarg and Andheri. Meanwhile, on Thursday 28,782 citizens were vaccinated,. Overall, 2,428,626 citizens have been vaccinated in the city since January 16, 2021.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/vaccination-drive-for-45-in-mumbai-suspended-for-3-days-101619721523490.html

Arrested in March 2020, the deceased was bailed out from jail just five days ago. “He was arrested for raping his teenaged step-daughter on the complaint of his wife.

30-04-2021||Ranchi||‘State likely to begin vaccination of 18+ only after May 15’||Strap: Vaccine manufacturing companies expressed inability to provide vaccines before May 15, claims health minister Banna GuptaThe much awaited inoculation drive covering people aged between 18-44 years amid the ongoing deadly second wave of Covid-19 pandemic was likely to begin in state after May 15 when the vaccines arrive, officials said on Thursday. The upcoming phase of the Covid-19 vaccination drive was scheduled to start on May 1.State health minister Banna Gupta claimed that the two vaccine manufacturing companies in the country expressed inability to provide vaccines before May 15, as the Centre already placed an advance booking of 12 crore doses with them. “The (vaccine manufacturing) companies said they will have to deliver the Centre’s order by May 15. They said there was no chance of providing vaccines to Jharkhand before May 15, and that they will consider our order in the last week of May,” the health minister said.The Centre has approved two vaccines, Covishield and Covaxin, produced by Serum Institute of India and Bharat Biotech, respectively.However, Gupta claimed that the state was all set to start the drive from May 1. “We have done all required preparations to administer shots for free to citizens aged between 18-44 years from May 1. As many as 2,229 vaccination centres are also ready. A purchase order of 25 lakh doses for each the vaccines has also been placed. I will request the Centre to make sure that Jharkhand gets vaccines in time so that we can start the drive at the earliest,” he said.The state has identified 1.57 crore people between the age group of 18 and 44 for the upcoming phase, the health minister said.The Centre has allocated ₹35,000 crore for vaccination in the Union budget for 2020-21, said Gupta, questioning the central government’s decision of giving states the responsibility of purchasing the vaccines on their own for this phase. “If we consider the price of a dose, which is fixed at ₹300 for the state governments, with an estimated 118 crore citizens of the country to take the shot under this phase, it will cost around ₹35,400 crore. So, I will like to know from the Centre that when it has already allocated ₹35,000 crore in the Union budget, why are states forced to purchase the vaccines,” he said.“The Centre gives the slogan of one nation, one Constitution. Then, why three tariffs have been fixed for one vaccine. Despite all this, we are ready to purchase the vaccines from our pocket. But, companies are not ready provide them in time,” Gupta said.He said they have around 2.5 lakh doses in stock left for vaccinating people above 45 years of age.The state till April 28 inoculated 26,08,781 beneficiaries, comprising health care workers (HCW), frontline workers (FLW) and citizens above the age of 45 with the first dose of Covid-19 vaccine. As many as 4,53,926 were also given the second dose till April 28.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/state-likely-to-begin-vaccination-of-18-only-after-may-15-101619712102919.html
30-04-2021||Pune||Slam dunk: Sport psychologists the MVPs in current Covid climate||India is in the midst of a sports crisis with the Indian Premier League (IPL) being severely criticised for being played as the second Covid wave devastates the country. 2020 and 2021 have been some of the most challenging years in modern human society. With the entire world still in the throes of a pandemic, sports were often asked to take a backburner to the more important and basic functional elements of each country’s society. Even more unique was the fact that the pandemic first started in a year where the Summer Olympics were planned as the marquee event of the sporting community. In fact, there have only been three times in history where the Olympics have been cancelled or postponed, and none of these have occurred since World War II. The uncertainty of the current global sporting climate has led us to understand and appreciate sports and the unity that sports can bring even among various boundaries more than ever. Highly competitive athletes are always able to train with an end-goal and performance in mind, depending on their sport. For example, a sprinter may be training with an eye on the Summer Olympics or World Championships, a football player may train for the UEFA Champions League or the World Cup, a basketball player preparing for the NBA season, NBA Finals or the Olympics. Due to the pandemic, however, this was the first time for many modern athletes that their preparations were interrupted due to uncertainty over whether their sports would even continue. Due to this uncertainty, the role of sport psychologists has been magnified more than at any point ever before. The major part of a sport psychologist’s role has involved teaching athletes to adapt to the “new normal” in a society that is overrun by the pandemic. Changing athletes’ perspective and teaching them strategies to be more resilient and adaptable is a critical part of the psychologist job description throughout the last 18 months. Since athlete performance is heavily influenced by mindset, a psychologist may seek to have the athlete view uncertain circumstances as an opportunity for growth to learn to be more resilient. In sports performance, the mental approach, lifestyle and stability of an individual is crucial to their success. Harnessing all these factors to work together, even in a pandemic, requires a great support network. For an individual athlete playing a sport, the range of emotional trauma experienced from having their entire livelihood taken away from them is not too dissimilar to the emotions experienced by the vast majority of society. In this time, we can appreciate the stability and unity that sports contribute towards providing our modern society. As every individual’s life has been heavily impacted, it is crucial to recognise the parallels between those playing sport and contributing to the entertainment and this sense of stability and unity in our society. There can be an argument made that many athletes have had their careers cut short and taken away from them overnight, due to the very finite lifespan an athlete faces. It is important to recognise a universal truth regardless of one’s profession, we are all susceptible and vulnerable to the full spectrum of human emotion and that nobody can truly encounter the challenges of life without a well-built support system around them. Work pressure and non-disclosure agreements have cut short my contribution to this space. This is my final piece... for now. However, basketball fans and players, keep your eyes on the NBA, it is one of the sporting lights in our dark Covid world of today.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/slam-dunk-sport-psychologists-the-mvps-in-current-covid-climate-101619709042696.html

The Indian assistance was a consignment of anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine sent in 2020 at the request of then US president Donald Trump.US Secretary of defence Lloyd Austin tweeted a video of a US C-17 transport plane landing in New Delhi with relief supplies. “The landing of this C-17 in Delhi is a tribute to all of the women and men who banded together to deliver medical & oxygen supplies to our friends and partners in India. Great job.”The United States had pledged assistance worth $100 millions, which includes oxygen plants and cylinders, personal protective equipment such as N95 mass and therapeutics like remdesivir. It has also cleared the export of raw materials needed by Indian vaccine maker Serum Institute of India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-steps-up-efforts-to-support-india-s-covid-fight-101619803669119.html
30-04-2021||World||Fired 65 employees for racist, discriminatory conduct over the last year: Boeing||Boeing Co said on Friday it fired 65 employees over the last year for engaging in or being part of racist, discriminatory or hateful conduct.In a company-wide report that reveals the first demographic breakdown of its workforce, the planemaker said the employees were terminated between June 2020 and April 21, 2021.American companies have come under pressure from investors to publicly disclose information about diversity among employees in the wake of racial justice and movements such as Black Lives Matter.Boeing said about 69% of its U.S. workforce was made of white employees and 31% from other races, including about 6.4% Black employees. Boeing has previously said it aims to take the number of Black employees up by 20%.Boeing, which has seen the ranks of its senior female executives shrink in recent years, also said data showed women made up 13.6% of its executive council, a drop from about 30% over the past year.Part of the reason for the gender gap in the council is its expansion to 22 members, with just three female executives, from 13 members, with four female executives, as of March 1, 2020.Overall, women represented between 23% and 25% of Boeing U.S. and non-U.S. workforce, the company said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fired-65-employees-for-racist-discriminatory-conduct-over-the-last-year-boeing-101619802382476.html
30-04-2021||World||US retains India on list of IPR violators||The United States has retained India on its list of most egregious violators of intellectual property rights even though it noted gradual progress in the online sphere. And, it pointed to global concerns about counterfeits of Covid-19 related materials coming from China, including testing kits and masks.“India has remained inconsistent in its progress on intellectual property (IP) protection and enforcement,” said the US trade representative’s annual Special 301 report for 2021 released on Friday. “While India’s enforcement of IP in the online sphere has gradually improved, a lack of concrete benefits for innovators and creators persists, which continue to undermine their efforts.”India was among nine US trading partners on the “priority watch list”, which is the category for worst IP violators, according to the United States Trade Representative (USTR). The others are Argentina, Chile, China, Indonesia, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Ukraine and Venezuela.“These countries will be the subject of particularly intense bilateral engagement during the coming year,” the report said.Overall, 23 countries are on the “watch list”.Among other IP issue with China, the report noted global concern with Chinese counterfeiting of Covid-19 related materials. “This past year, countries reported significant quantities of Covid-19 testing kits, personal protective equipment (PPE) such as N-95 and equivalent masks, and sanitisers, detergents, and disinfectants from China that were determined to be counterfeit.”The United States has made IP protection and enforcement a key element of trading relations with India and has been pushing it for a long time to do more. “India remains one of the world’s most challenging major economies with respect to protection and enforcement of IP,” said the USTR’s report. Patents were of “particular concern” because of “potential threat of patent revocations, lack of presumption of patent validity, and the narrow patentability criteria under the India Patents Act burden companies across different sectors”.The Special 301 report said businesses there is a lack of effective systemic protection against the “unfair commercial use, and unauthorised disclosure, of undisclosed test or other data generated to obtain marketing approval” for pharmaceutical and agricultural chemical products.IP enforcement is “inadequate” and trademark counterfeiting remains “problematic”, the report noted. And copyright holders continue to report “high levels of piracy, particularly online”.But India has also made “meaningful progress” in promoting IP protection and enforcement in some areas over the past year, according to report, but “it failed to resolve recent and long-standing challenges, and it created new concerns for right holders”.Among positive developments, the report noted India’s partnership in the Quad vaccine partnership. India is expected to manufacture 1 billion doses of Covid-19 vaccines under partnership funded by Japan and the United States, with Australia taking up the last-mile distribution responsibility. The vaccines are meant for Indo-Pacific region countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-retains-india-on-list-of-ipr-violators-101619802589272.html
30-04-2021||World||UK allows dancing without distancing at nightclub test event||Several thousand music fans on Friday became the first people in Britain in more than a year to legally dance, drink and listen to music in a nightclub, as part of a test to see whether social distancing measures can be eased without triggering new coronavirus outbreaks.The afternoon-admission gig at a warehouse in Liverpool, northwest England, is one of a series of pilot events sponsored by the U.K. government and closely monitored by public health officials. The 3,000 attendees, all local residents, were to be tested before and after the event, while researchers will study air quality and movement in the venue.Once inside, clubbers could dance to DJs including Lewis Boardman and Jayda G. with no restrictions on mixing with others.“Today is going to be monumental,” said DJ Yousef, co-founder of Liverpool’s Circus nightclub, which organized the event.“Once you go over the threshold, the whole point of today is to go back to pre-COVID conditions, which of course is no social distancing, no masks. You can interact with people you don’t know,” he told the BBC. He said the reaction of ticket-buyers to that news had been “disbelief” as well as excitement.“We are very excited," Leah Lawless, 18, said as she waited with her friends to get in to the warehouse. She said the past year had been "hard. It's been boring, a bit sad, depressing and not the best.”A second clubbing event will be held in the same venue on Saturday, and 5,000 fans will attend a concert headlined by the band Blossoms at Liverpool’s Sefton Park on Sunday. The test events will culminate at Wembley Stadium on May 15, where a one-quarter capacity crowd of 21,000 will watch the FA Cup soccer final.Britain has recorded more than 127,000 coronavirus deaths, Europe’s highest toll. But a fast-moving vaccination campaign has given almost two-thirds of adults at least one shot, and the government is gradually lifting the restrictions on social and economic life that were in place over much of the last 14 months.Most shops and services are open, but indoor drinking, dining and entertainment will not resume before May 17 at the earliest. Some social distancing rules will be in place until at least June 21.Experiences elsewhere in Europe are encouraging. Organizers of a Barcelona concert last month attended by 4,500 mask-wearing fans who had been screened for the virus say the event produced no significant outbreaks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-allows-dancing-without-distancing-at-nightclub-test-event-101619802355222.html
30-04-2021||World||US embassy in Moscow limits services after Russia hiring ban||The U.S. Embassy in Moscow said Friday it will sharply curtail its consular activities due to a Russian ban on hiring local residents to work there.The embassy said in a statement that starting May 12, it will only provide emergency U.S. citizen services and a very limited number of immigrant visas for such life-or-death emergencies.It noted that non-immigrant visa processing for non-diplomatic travel will cease and it will stop offering routine notarial services, consular reports of birth abroad or passport renewal services for the foreseeable future.Moscow has moved to ban the U.S. Embassy and consular offices from hiring Russian and third-country nationals as part of its retaliation to a set of new U.S. sanctions imposed over Russian interference in the 2020 U.S. presidential election and involvement in the SolarWind hack of federal agencies — activities Moscow has denied.The U.S. ordered 10 Russian diplomats out, targeted dozens of companies and people and imposed new curbs on Russia’s ability to borrow money. Russia quickly retaliated by ordering 10 U.S. diplomats to leave, blacklisting eight current and former U.S. officials and tightening requirements for U.S. Embassy operations.The U.S. Embassy warned that the provision of emergency services to U.S. citizens in Russia may also be “delayed or limited due to staff’s constrained ability to travel outside of Moscow.”It said it was unable to answer specific questions about Russian residency or Russian visas and strongly urged any U.S. citizens present in Russia with expired visas to depart before a June 15 deadline set by the Russian government.“We regret that the actions of the Russian government have forced us to reduce our consular workforce by 75%, and will endeavor to offer to U.S. citizens as many services as possible,” the embassy said.The Russian Foreign Ministry commented on Facebook, charging that the decision to limit consular activities indicated that the U.S. diplomatic and consular activities are “archaic and inefficient.”The ministry suggested that Washington expand its American staff to replace the local hires.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-embassy-in-moscow-limits-services-after-russia-hiring-ban-101619799773396.html

A ministry of health spokesman said around 40 people had been taken to hospital, some in a critical condition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/blast-kills-27-people-in-afghanistan-s-eastern-logar-province-report-101619798774659.html

Swarms of flies spread near the reservoir and thousands of fish were decomposing in already dirty waters."This phenomenon appeared on the shore of the lake several days ago," said Ahmad Askar, a local activist. "The fish started floating up, and in abnormal quantities...It's unacceptable."At least 40 tonnes have turned up dead in a few days, numbers which Askar and fishermen in Qaraoun described as unprecedented. They called on the Litani river authority to find the cause and go after anyone dumping wastewater into the lake.The river authority said this week that the fish were toxic and carried a virus, urging people to avoid fishing all along the Litani due to "an aggravated disaster that threatens public health".The pollution prompted a ban since 2018 on fishing in the reservoir, which was created in 1959 with a large dam to collect water for hydropower and irrigation.Last month, volunteers removed clumps of sticky tar from some beaches along the Lebanese coast after an oil spill which environmentalists warned would harm marine life.Ecological disasters are the last thing Lebanon needs as it suffers through an alarming financial collapse and the aftermath of a huge explosion that devastated Beirut port last August.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/at-least-40-tonnes-of-dead-fish-wash-up-on-shore-of-polluted-lebanese-lake-101619792158371.html

Although only 31, she has been in the job for a decade."I have been working for so long, but now because of Covid situation it has become very difficult for us to operate but still we try to give good care and get the patients into hospitals," she said."We feel very good doing this but sometimes we also feel scared. However, despite all that we try to forget everything else and keeping nice feelings in our hearts, just think of doing good."Wearing a white protective suit and mask, Patel gently holds the hand of an elderly woman lying on a stretcher in an ambulance and monitors her oxygen levels.Her family is supportive of her work, she says, but she is afraid of bringing the virus home."Sometimes they feel scared that I work in such risky conditions and then come home in the evening... but still they support me and I also feel good that they appreciate me for working in this field."Before the pandemic, Patel and an ambulance driver would typically take about two hours to attend to an emergency, including transporting patients to hospital and giving them the necessary care.Now, the rise in the number of Covid-19 patients and acute shortage of beds in the hospitals means she sometimes spends several hours taking care of the sick in the ambulance while waiting for hospitals to accept them.India, the world's second-most populous nation, is in deep crisis, with hospitals and morgues overwhelmed by the pandemic, medicines and oxygen in short supply and strict curbs on movement in its biggest cities.The authorities reported 386,452 new cases and 3,498 deaths in the last 24 hours, but medical experts believe actual Covid-19 numbers may be five to 10 times greater than the official tally.But Patel has no choice but to get on with her work. At a government hospital, she waits for doctors to admit a patient she has brought.The man, who is lying on the floor with an oxygen tank next to him, had difficulty breathing but his oxygen levels had now improved, Patel said."Right now I have brought him to a government hospital but there is a wait over here. So we will have to wait."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/just-think-of-doing-good-indian-paramedics-battle-deluge-of-covid-19-patients-101619785623245.html

The children will continue to be monitored for longer-term protection and safety for another two years.BioNTech and Pfizer have previously requested their emergency use authorization with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration also be extended to children 12 to 15 years old.German Health Minister Jens Spahn welcomed the news that the vaccine might soon get the green light for older children.“This can make a further real difference to our vaccine campaign, if approval is granted,” he said on the sidelines of a visit to a vaccine manufacturing plant in the German town of Reinbek.The COVID-19 vaccine made by Pfizer and BioNTech was the first one to be granted a greenlight by the EMA last December, when it was licensed for anyone 16 and over across the 27-nation EU bloc.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pfizer-biontech-seek-covid-19-vaccine-authorization-for-kids-101619785612033.html

30-04-2021||World||Chinese President Xi Jinping offers help to India in its fight against Covid-19||Chinese President Xi Jinping on Friday expressed serious concern on the coronavirus pandemic in India and offered to help fight the outbreak in a message to Prime Minister Narendra Modi.Xi expressed his condolences to Modi on the current pandemic situation in India.“China is willing to strengthen anti-pandemic cooperation with India, and provide support and help to the country,” official news agency Xinhua quoted Xi as saying.“I am very concerned about the recent outbreak of new coronary pneumonia in India and would like to express sincere condolences to the Indian government and people on behalf of the Chinese government and Chinese people, and on my own behalf,” Xi said in the message.The Chinese President added that human beings are a community of destiny, and only through solidarity and cooperation can the nations of the world finally overcome the epidemic.“China is ready to strengthen anti-epidemic cooperation with India and provide support and assistance to India. I am confident that under the leadership of the Indian government, the people of India will be able to overcome the epidemic,” Xi added.Earlier in the day, the Chinese foreign ministry said local companies have exported more than 3,800 tonnes of medical supplies and over 26,000 ventilators to India in April to help fight the surging Covid-19 pandemic in the country.The Chinese customs department is also providing clearance to transport liquid oxygen storage tanks and oxygen generators to India from many cities, foreign ministry spokesperson, Wang Wenbin said, adding that Chinese provincial governments, NGOs and individual companies are also raising anti-epidemic material that India needs urgently.As it turns out, the medical and equipment supplies from China to India are mostly being done between companies as New Delhi and Beijing are yet to open a government-to-government route for such dealings.India is yet to even officially acknowledge China’s offer of help, which was first made by the Chinese foreign ministry through a media briefing last week.Friday’s update from the foreign ministry came a day after state councilor and foreign minister Wang Yi promised external affairs minister, S Jaishankar, that China will do the utmost in supporting India’s fight against current outbreak in India at a faster pace.In a letter to Jaishankar, Wang said that the Chinese side “shares empathy for the challenges facing India and expresses sincere sympathy”.Following up on minister Wang’s promise, foreign ministry spokesperson Wang said China has always been paying close attention to the development of the epidemic situation in India.Wang said many sections of Chinese society have taken action to collect material to send to India and to “deliver them to the Indian people as soon as possible”.According to statistics provided by Wang, since April, China has exported more than 26,000 ventilators and oxygen generators, more than 15,000 monitors, and nearly 3,800 tons of medical materials and medicines to India.China’s relevant anti-epidemic material and medical equipment companies are working hard, working overtime, and speeding up production, Wang said, adding that over the next few days, more anti-epidemic resources will continue to be sent to India to support its anti-epidemic efforts.Wang added that many donations in this context are being made through unofficial channels.The spokesperson added the cargo routes from China to India are operating normally.In the past two weeks, many cargo flights of Chinese airlines from China to India have operated, he said without giving details.Wang added that Chinese authorities have provided and are providing customs clearance for India to transport liquid oxygen storage tanks, oxygen generators and other materials back from many cities in China.China, he said, will continue to maintain a smooth channel for exports of materials to India.In his letter to Jaishankar, foreign minister Wang said that anti-pandemic materials produced in China were entering India at a faster pace to help it fight the epidemic.“The Chinese side will continue to do its utmost to provide support and help according to the needs of India. We hope and believe that under the leadership of the Indian government, the Indian people will surely prevail over the epidemic at an early date,” he added.China’s Ambassador to India Sun Weidong in a tweet on Wednesday said Chinese medical suppliers are working overtime on orders from India, “at least 25,000 orders for oxygen concentrators in recent days. Cargo planes are under plan for medical supplies. Chinese customs will facilitate relevant process”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/faster-customs-clearance-to-medical-consignment-to-india-china-101619778048582.html

That compares with about 33 weekly flights before Covid. Korean Air Lines Co. and Asiana Airlines Inc. meanwhile are planning to charter flights from India to help South Koreans there wanting to return. Both carriers, which had previously halted all scheduled services to the South Asian nation because of the pandemic, are working with regulators to finalize the flights’ details.India now has the world’s fastest-growing Covid caseload with 18.8 million confirmed instances. The nation set another record Friday with 386,452 additional cases. Deaths rose by 3,498 to 208,330. The political and financial capitals of New Delhi and Mumbai are in lockdown and this week, the U.S. told its citizens to get out of India as soon as possible.The ferocious surge in new cases has also reversed one of the airline industry’s biggest travel comebacks. Carriers in India had reached 87% of their pre-pandemic seat capacity through early April, based on a Bloomberg analysis of data from flight tracker OAG, but that progress has now unraveled led by a pullback in domestic flights, which make up the vast majority of the market.As the outbreak overwhelms the nation’s hospitals and crematoriums, an upturn in air travel won’t happen until the latest crisis is contained, Rob Morris, the head of consultancy at U.K. aviation advisory firm Cirium, said earlier this week.The U.S. released a Level 4 travel advisory, the highest of its kind issued by the State Department.“U.S. citizens are reporting being denied admittance to hospitals in some cities due to a lack of space,” the website of the U.S. Embassy and Consulates in India said in a health alert. All routine U.S. citizen services and visa services at the U.S. Consulate General Chennai have been canceled.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/airlines-add-flights-out-of-ravaged-india-to-bring-citizens-home-101619776384942.html
30-04-2021||World||Boris Johnson's phone number was online for 15 years: Report||The British government downplayed allegations Friday of a security risk after it was reported that Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s cell phone number was openly available on the internet for 15 years.Celebrity website Popbitch revealed that the number was on a think tank press release from 2006, when Johnson was an opposition lawmaker and the Conservative Party’s higher education spokesman.Callers to the number on Thursday night heard an automated message saying the phone was “switched off." By Friday it appeared to no longer be in use.Home Office minister Victoria Atkins insisted that the prime minister "knows his responsibilities when it comes to national security,” and criticized media for revealing the fact that the number was in the public domain.But former National Security Adviser Peter Ricketts said that if the number was widely available it could be used for eavesdropping by hostile states, “and possibly other non-state actors as well, like sophisticated criminal gangs.”Johnson is already facing questions about his text and WhatsApp message exchanges with business leaders and lobbyists.He has denied doing anything wrong when he exchanged text messages last year with industrialist James Dyson and promised he would “fix” the tax rules for him if Dyson agreed to make ventilators for the National Health Service.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/boris-johnson-s-phone-number-was-online-for-15-years-report-101619776499261.html
30-04-2021||World||AstraZeneca reports $275 million sales of Covid-19 shot, expects hit to ease||AstraZeneca's Covid-19 vaccine delivered $275 million in first-quarter sales while shaving three cents per share from earnings, the drugmaker said on Friday as it posted better-than-expected results and forecast second half growth.This is the first time the Anglo-Swedish drugmaker has given financial details of the distribution and sales of the vaccine, which it developed with Oxford University. It has said it will not make a profit from the shot during the pandemic.The vaccine revenue included delivery of about 68 million doses, AstraZeneca said, adding that sales in Europe, where it faces a legal case, were $224 million, in emerging markets $43 million and $8 million in the rest of the world.Sales of $275 million for 68 million doses equates to a price tag of around $4 per shot.The results come after a bruising start to the year as the drugmaker struggles with production of its vaccine and faces a legal battle after cutting deliveries to Europe, while regulators probe rare blood clots in people who got the shot.Shares in AstraZeneca rose 3% to 7,621 pence at 0744 GMT. The stock, which hit record highs in July 2020 due to optimism around the vaccine, ended last year 4% lower."This is good enough," Barclays analysts in a note.VACCINE RACEAstraZeneca was one of the leaders in the global race to develop a COVID-19 vaccine. Its cheap and easily transportable shot was hailed as a milestone in the fight against the crisis, but has since faced a series of setbacks.In presentation slides, AstraZeneca said it was ramping up vaccine supplies and production yields were improving, without giving any details.Pfizer, whose Covid-19 vaccine is several times more costly per dose than AstraZeneca's, in February forecast $15 billion for its share of sales from the vaccine, co-developed with partner BioNTech, with analysts expecting as much as $18 billion on average.BioNTech expects close to 10 billion euros ($12.1 billion) in revenues from committed vaccine deliveries this year but raised the prospect of more supply deals.Moderna in February said it was expecting sales of $18.4 billion from its own vaccine this year.Before AstraZeneca's earnings, market researcher GlobalData said it expected annual sales of $278 million this year and next for the drugmaker's coronavirus vaccine, branded Vaxzevria.AstraZeneca said it would submit an application for U.S. emergency use in the coming weeks, adding global data from late-stage trials and emerging real-world data after a roll-out.The vaccine's efficacy data has been questioned in the past.CORE RESILIENTWhile the coronavirus continues to have a mixed impact on drugmakers, AstraZeneca's core business has proved resilient.The drugmaker stuck to its forecast for 2021 on Friday and predicted better times ahead.Its guidance does not include any impact from sales of the vaccine and its $39 billion purchase of Alexion, which is expected to close in the third quarter."We expect the impact of COVID to reduce and anticipate a performance acceleration in the second half of 2021," AstraZeneca Chief Executive Pascal Soriot said in statement.Total revenue of $7.32 billion for the three months to March exceeded analysts' expectations of $6.94 billion, while core earnings of $1.63 cents per share beat a consensus of $1.48.Quarterly sales growth was driven by best-selling lung cancer drug Tagrisso, up 17% to $1.15 billion, while revenues from heart and diabetes drug Farxiga jumped to a better-than-expected $625 million, on new prescriptions for heart failure.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/astrazeneca-reports-275-million-sales-of-covid-19-shot-expects-hit-to-ease-101619773134384.html
30-04-2021||World||Two influencers ordered off Bali after fake mask video prank||A U.S.-based YouTuber and a Russian influencer were ordered off Indonesia’s resort island of Bali on Friday after recording themselves defying mandatory mask-wearing with some imaginative makeup.Clips of the video created by Josh Paler Lin and Leia Se and posted two weeks ago show the two duping supermarket guards with a painted surgical mask after they were refused entry because Se was unmasked.“Did you notice like no one’s actually looking at you?” Lin exclaimed. “I can’t believe it worked!” he said in the video that appears to have been taken down from his social media accounts but has since been reposted elsewhere.Lin is a Taiwanese passport holder whose YouTube channel specializes in prank videos and is followed by 3.4 million fans. Se has over 25,000 Instagram followers.Although first-time violators of Bali's mask-wearing rule face fines of 1 million rupiah ($70) for foreigners and deportation after a second offense, the police wanted them removed off the island immediately.“It’s only proper to sanction them more severely, not just with a fine but also deportation,” said Bali’s civil service police unit head Dewa Nyoman Rai Dharmadi. “They are not only violating, but deliberately provoking in public to defy health guidelines.”The pair had shown remorse and apologized through Lin’s Instagram video.“I made this video to entertain people because I’m a content creator and it’s my job to entertain people,” Lin said, “However, I did not realize that what I did could actually bring a lot of negative comments,” he said, advising people to always wear masks and invite everyone to help Bali regain its tourism.Jamaruli Manihuruk, who heads the Bali regional office for the Justice and Human Rights Ministry, said that Lin and Se to be deported as soon as possible after they are tested for Covid-19.“Foreigners who don’t respect the laws and regulations in Indonesia are facing deportation sanctions,” Manihuruk said. He said Lin and Se will be placed in a detention cell at the immigration office while waiting for their flight.In January, authorities in Bali deported Sergei Kosenko, a Russian social media celebrity, after he posted a video of himself driving a motorcycle with a female passenger on the back off a pier into the sea. The stunt was condemned by many Indonesians as reckless and a potentially hazardous to the environment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/two-influencers-ordered-off-bali-after-fake-mask-video-prank-101619772502016.html
30-04-2021||World||WHO should look beyond animals on Covid-19 origin, scientists say||The World Health Organization should convene another investigation into the origins of the coronavirus pandemic that looks beyond animal sources, a group of scientists said in an open letter.The signatories proposed specific steps on what any new probe should take into account. Suggestions include ensuring that a team can undertake studies without the “unnecessary presence” of government officials of the host country, removing any veto powers in the member-selection process and a mandate for broad access to data, records and samples.A joint mission including scientists from China and organized with the WHO found that the coronavirus probably spread from bats to humans via another animal, and considered a laboratory incident the least likely hypothesis. Because the study’s aim was defined as probing the zoonotic source of the virus, other theories didn’t receive the same attention and the team didn’t fully investigate labs, Peter Ben Embarek, co-leader of the trip, said after a report was published in March.WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said afterward that the probe didn’t adequately analyze the possibility of a lab accident before deciding it’s most likely the pathogen spread from bats to humans via another animal. He said he is ready to deploy additional missions involving specialist experts. However, that will require China’s cooperation.The Chinese city of Wuhan, where the first Covid-19 outbreak was identified, is home to a high-security virus lab, and that proximity has prompted former U.S. President Donald Trump and others to speculate on the possibility of a leak. China has denied any connection, floating the alternative theory that the virus may have entered the country via frozen-food imports.The open letter published Friday was the third from the group. The more than 20 signatories included Steven Quay, chief executive officer at Atossa Therapeutics Inc., which develops treatments for breast cancer and Covid-19, while Jamie Metzl, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, co-organized it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-should-look-beyond-animals-on-covid-19-origin-scientists-say-101619772598877.html
30-04-2021||World||Explained: What remains as US ends Afghan 'forever war'||After 20 years, America is ending its “forever war” in Afghanistan.Announcing a firm withdrawal deadline, President Joe Biden cut through the long debate, even within the U.S. military, over whether the time was right. Starting Saturday, the last remaining 2,500 to 3,500 American troops will begin leaving, to be fully out by Sept. 11 at the latest.Another debate will likely go on far longer: Was it worth it?Since 2001, tens of thousands of Afghans and 2,442 American soldiers have been killed, millions of Afghans driven from their homes, and billions of dollars spent on war and reconstruction. As the departure begins, The Associated Press takes a look at the mission and what it accomplished.Fighting terrorIn the early days after the Sept. 11, 2001 terror attacks in the U.S., the mission seemed clear: Hunt down and punish the perpetrators.The U.S. determined that al-Qaida and its leader, Osama bin Laden, had plotted the attack from the safety of Afghanistan, protected by its radical Taliban rulers. At the time the Taliban were a pariah government, under U.N. sanctions and vilified in the West for their rule by a harsh interpretation of Islamic law.Until 9/11, the U.S. had watched Afghanistan from a distance, occasionally requesting the Taliban to hand over bin Laden and once in 1998 firing a couple of cruise missiles at an al-Qaida base in eastern Afghanistan.Now America was leading an invasion, dubbed Operation Enduring Freedom, with the mission of removing the Taliban and destroying al-Qaida.Washington turned to the only allies in Afghanistan it could — a collection of warlords, most of whom were former mujahedeen backed by the U.S. in the 1980s in the fight against the invading Soviet Union. Rallying around the U.S. after 9/11, NATO joined the coalition.Within weeks of the invasion and aerial bombardment, the U.S.-led coalition had pounded the Taliban into submission and driven them from power. Its leadership fled, its fighters lost control of the entire nation. Al-Qaida as well fled underground, crossing into neighboring Pakistan.The hunt for bin Laden took 10 years. Finally, he was tracked to his hideout in Pakistan, barely 100 kilometers (60 miles) from Islamabad. A U.S. Navy Seals team went in under cover of darkness and killed him.But in the interceding decade, America and NATO had been dragged into a dramatically expanded mission. Then-Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld at first said America was not in Afghanistan to nation-build. That would change.When the U.S. invaded Iraq in 2003, it took its eye off Afghanistan. It left it to the former warlords, pre-occupied with wealth and power. The first post-Taliban president, Hamid Karzai, raised the idea of talks with the Taliban to work out a peace, and the crushed militants put out signals they wanted to reach an accommodation.But American officials blocked any negotiations with the Taliban, convinced the insurgents could be militarily destroyed.Instead, the militants re-emerged in a long insurgency, and the U.S. found itself pouring in money and manpower to help the Afghan government fight and to rebuild the war-shattered nation. With the flood of billions of dollars, corruption only grew in the U.S.-backed government, only growing worse as the years went on.Meanwhile, al-Qaida’s ability to strike the U.S. and the West has been severely damaged. But the group has spread in branches in multiple countries fighting in insurgencies.Biden explained his decision to pull out the last 2,500-3,500 American soldiers from Afghanistan, saying America’s security concerns had evolved.“Bin Laden is dead, and al-Qaida is degraded in Iraq and Afghanistan," he said, arguing that the terror threat has “metastasized” into a global phenomenon, not to be fought with thousands of troops on the ground in one country but with new technology. The U.S., he said, must be freed to fight the 21st century’s more sophisticated challenges, including competition from Russia and China.For the situation in Afghanistan, he said he didn’t see how continued American military presence would bring a turnaround. “When will it be the right moment to leave? One more year, two more years, ten more years?” he said.“’Not now” — that’s how we got here.’”What now for Afghanistan?The U.S. and NATO leave behind an Afghanistan that is at least half run directly or indirectly by the Taliban — despite billions poured into training and arming Afghan forces to fight them. Riddled with corruption and tied to regional warlords, the U.S.-backed government is widely distrusted by many Afghans.Washington and its international allies are putting heavy pressure on the government and the Taliban to reach a peace deal. The hope is that both sides realize military victory is impossible and that peace together is the only way forward.The best case scenario is some sort of government including the Taliban that can pave the way for a drawing up a new constitutional system for the future, including some form of elections.The very possible worst case scenario is that peace talks fail, and Afghanistan is plunged into a new chapter of its decades of civil war. That new phase could be more brutal than ever, with not only the Taliban but the country’s other, multiple warlords and armed factions battling it out for power.The past 20 years since the Taliban were ousted have unquestionably seen gains for the Afghans. But they are fragile and risk being wiped away as the Americans step away — whether frittered away under a new government or crushed by continued war.Girls are allowed an education, which had been banned under the Taliban. Still, at least 3.6 million children, the majority of them girls, are not in school, according to UNICEF.Women are working and are in Parliament. Their voices are strong yet still Afghanistan’s Parliament has been unable to pass The Violence Against Women bill because religious conservatives dominate. The Georgetown Institute for Women, Peace and Security has consistently ranked Afghanistan as one of the worst countries in the world to be a woman.Before the war in 2001, the Taliban had eradicated opium production in Afghanistan, according to United Nations figures. Today, it produces more opium than every other opium-producing country combined, despite the U.S. spending millions to eradicate drug production.The opium industry in 2019, the latest available figures show, earned between $1.2 billion and $2.1 billion, outstripping the value of the country’s legal exports, according to John Sopko, the U.S. government’s watchdog on Afghan reconstruction. More than $14 million of that went into the coffers of the Taliban, who tax drug movement throughout the country.Despite billions in U.S. humanitarian and reconstruction aid, more than half the population of 36 million lives under the World Bank-set poverty line of $1.90 a day — and millions more live not much above that level. Unemployment is at 40%. The U.N. and Red Cross say nearly half of all Afghan children face the danger of hunger.The majority of Afghans hold out little hope for their future according to a 2018 Gallup poll.“Afghanistan is bordering a failed state status and is sure to enter the category immediately after the withdrawal of the foreign forces absent a better political arrangement,” said Torek Farhadi, a political analyst and former government adviser. “That is the reality of Afghanistan.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/explained-what-remains-as-us-ends-afghan-forever-war-101619772439141.html

All three had travelled to India, and are under medical observation.Authorities are seeking to trace their contacts and investigating other suspected cases, the ministry said. It noted that the variant has been detected in at least six other European countries.France last week stepped up virus controls for travellers arriving from India as well as some other countries where variants are spreading.The announcement came as French President Emmanuel Macron laid out a four-stage reopening process aimed at boosting the economy, welcoming back tourists and lifting nearly all of France's virus restrictions by June 30.The vast majority of France's virus cases now involve the more contagious, more dangerous variant first identified in Britain. France has reported one of the worlds highest virus death tolls, at more than 103,000 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-finds-first-case-of-covid-19-variant-sweeping-india-101619768774496.html

Earnings hit 15.79 dollars per diluted share.Total net sales from the quarter grew 44 per cent from the year-ago period to 108.5 billion dollars.CNN said the company's cloud unit and biggest money maker, Amazon Web Services, posted net sales of 13.5 billion dollars during the quarter, up 32 per cent year-over-year.That is an acceleration in growth from the prior quarter as more companies adopt the technology to help manage hybrid workforces.Despite a tough year-over-year comparison because of the surge in demand the pandemic caused in 2020, Amazon still expects net sales between 110 billion and 116 billion dollars, up 24 per cent to 30 per cent from the same period in the prior year during the second quarter of 2021.A day before the earnings report, Amazon announced it will spend 1 billion dollars to raise wages for more than 500,000 hourly workers by as much as 3 dollars an hour as it continues its hiring push that has elevated its global workforce beyond 1.3 million people globally.The company will not, however, increase its 15 dollars per hour minimum wage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/amazons-profit-soars-more-than-200-in-q1-to-usd-8-billion-101619767997986.html
30-04-2021||World||Polish scientists discover world's first 'pregnant' Egyptian mummy||Polish scientists said Thursday they have discovered the world's first pregnant Egyptian mummy while carrying out scans on the 2,000-year-old remains kept at the National Museum in Warsaw."My husband Stanislaw, an Egyptian archaeologist, and I looked at the X-ray images and noticed a familiar sight for parents of three children in the belly of the dead woman -- a little foot!" Marzena Ozarek-Szilke, an anthropologist and archaeologist at the University of Warsaw, told journalists.Further analysis revealed the whole foetus and scientists working on the Warsaw Mummy Project believe the woman was between 20 and 30 years old and was 26-30 weeks pregnant."We do not know why the foetus was not taken out of the belly of the deceased during mummification," said Wojciech Ejsmond from the Polish Academy of Sciences, another project participant."That is why this mummy is truly unique. We have not been able to find any similar cases. This means that 'our' mummy is the only recognised in the world with a foetus," he said.Ozarek-Szilke speculated that there may have been an effort to "camouflage the pregnancy... or, perhaps, it had some significance related to beliefs and re-birth in the afterlife".Based on an analysis of the hieroglyphs on the sarcophagus, the mummy was originally thought to be of a male priest who lived between the first century BC and the first century AD.Scientists now believe it could be even older than that and are looking into the possible causes of death.The mummy has not been opened but one scan showed the woman had long curly hair down to her shoulders.The research has been published in the latest issue of peer-reviewed Journal of Archaeological Science."This is the first known case of a pregnant embalmed body... It opens up new possibilities of researching pregnancy in ancient times and practices related to maternity," the article said.The scans were carried out by Affidea, a medical analysis company, using equipment provided by GE, both project backers.The mummy was brought to Poland in the 19th century and became part of the antiquities collection at the University of Warsaw.It has been kept at the National Museum since 1917, where it is on show to the public alongside the sarcophagus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/polish-scientists-discover-world-s-first-pregnant-egyptian-mummy-101619766128259.html

The UN stands ready to step up our support,” Guterres tweeted on Thursday.India’s Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador T S Tirumurti replied to Guterres’s tweet saying that India deeply appreciates “your sentiments and solidarity at this juncture. We also appreciate the support @UNinIndia is giving us,” tagging the Twitter handle of the United Nations in India.As per data by the World Health Organization, confirmed Covid-19 cases in India stand at over 18.37 million and more than 204,000 people have died due to the virus.Earlier this week, President of the UN General Assembly Volkan Bozkir had tweeted that he is “worried” about the Covid-19 situation in India, “a country which did so much to ensure #Vaccines4All in vulnerable countries. It’s time for the world to extend aid & support to India. No one’s safe until we’re all safe.”He had added that his thoughts are with the people of India at this time.The United Nations team in India is supporting the response of the country’s authorities to the Covid-19 pandemic by providing critical supplies and UN agencies are procuring thousands of oxygen concentrators, oxygen generating plants and other essential equipment as well as helping set up mobile hospital units.Deputy Spokesman for the Secretary-General, Farhan Haq had told reporters at the daily press briefing on Wednesday that the UN team in India, led by Resident Coordinator Renata Lok Dessallien, is supporting the authorities’ response to the pandemic by providing equipment and supplies, including to local governments.The WHO and UNICEF (United Nations Children’s Fund) are procuring equipment and supplies, including 7,000 oxygen concentrators and 500 nasal devices for oxygen supply, as well as oxygen generating plants, Covid-19 testing machines, and personal protective kits.WHO is also helping to set up mobile hospital units and is providing for laboratories.About 2,600 WHO field officers have been immediately deployed to support health authorities to curb the spread of the pandemic.In Maharashtra, UNICEF has engaged experts to work on risk governance. The UN team is also continuing its campaign highlighting the “three Ws: Wear a mask, Wash your Hands, Watch your distance and stay six feet apart.”“In India’s time of need, the UN is doing everything it can to rapidly provide critical equipment and supplies to central and state governments," Dessallien has said.WHO said in a press release that filling critical gaps in essential medical supplies and hospital capacities should be the top priority as India battles surge in Covid-19 cases.WHO is chartering flights to bring in 4,000 oxygen concentrators to help meet the increased demands.“The current rapid surge of Covid-19 cases has put immense pressure on the health systems, already overburdened since the start of the pandemic. We need to act with speed, expand hospital capacities and equip them with medical supplies, most needed to save lives,” Regional Director, WHO South-East Asia Region, Dr Poonam Khetrapal Singh has said.A UN News article said the South-East Asian region has led the world in Covid-19 infections for a third straight week, mainly due to the situation in India, which has recorded 2.17 million new cases, or a 52 per cent increase.In order to make available additional hospital beds and critical equipment for India, WHO is procuring mobile field hospitals with a capacity of 20-30 beds, which could be set up in the most affected areas. The bed capacity at these field hospitals can be increased to a maximum of 50, if needed, without impacting infection prevention and control protocols, and water and sanitation, the WHO release had added.The agency is also assisting laboratories to meet the huge demand for testing, and over 2,600 WHO technical staff, working on various programmes such as polio, TB and NTD, have been repurposed to support pandemic response in India.WHO is procuring laboratory supplies, including 1.2 million reagents, to meet the huge demand and need for testing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-stands-ready-to-step-up-support-to-india-guterres-on-covid-outbreak-101619755494452.html

It gives these family members the option to depart if they wish. Departure, again, is not required.”The United States has also extended the Level 4 “Do not travel” advisory, which Price said, was a “pro forma re-issuance” of a previously issued advisory that had “been in effect, given Covid not only in India but globally as well”.Also Read | US pushes ahead with nuclear plans despite watchdog concernsPrice refused to share details of reports of US embassy staff contracting Covid-19. CNN has reported citing sources that there has been a major outbreak at US missions in India. Two locally employed staff members have died and more than 100 tested positive. “It is fair to say that Covid has touched every – just about every element of Indian society, and of course, we do have a large diplomatic presence in India, as you might expect, given our global comprehensive partnership with India,” Price said, adding, “So while I can’t offer any specifics on US embassy employees or family members or locally employed staff, clearly this is a pandemic; this is an outbreak, a surge of cases in India that has left no part of the country untouched.”Asked about the removal and blocking of social media posts critical of the Indian government over the second wave of Covid-19 epidemic, Price said, “Of course, India is a large democracy with whom we share foundational values, and freedom of information, freedom of expression is something we support around the world.”Pushed back by a reporter who asked if freedom of expression and information extended to social media posts that incited violence, the state department spokesperson said that “hate speech, incitement to violence is something that we oppose everywhere”.“But clearly,” he added, “we support freedom of expression, while still calling out and condemning when we see incitement to violence and hate speech.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-allows-its-diplomats-in-india-to-send-families-home-101619753447040.html

30-04-2021||World||Eying 2024, Mike Pence makes 1st speech since leaving office||In his first public address since the end of the Trump administration, former Vice President Mike Pence on Thursday put down a marker for a potential return to elected office, telling an audience in early-voting South Carolina that he will use the coming months “pushing back on the liberal agenda" he says is wrong for the country.“We've got to guard our values ... by offering a positive agenda to the American people, grounded in our highest ideals,” Pence told an audience of several hundred at a Columbia dinner sponsored by a conservative Christian nonprofit that lobbies for what it considers to be “biblical values,” such as heterosexual marriage. “Now, over the coming months, I'll have more to say about all of that.”The choice of South Carolina for Pence's post-administration debut has definite political overtones, helping him develop exposure for a potential 2024 presidential bid. The state holds the first presidential primaries in the South, and candidates of both major parties typically spend more than a year in the state ahead of those votes, introducing themselves and trying to secure support.Republican candidates use South Carolina as a proving ground to test their anti-abortion-rights mettle. Thursday's event, hosted by Palmetto Family Council, also gave Pence a backdrop for some of the issues for which he long advocated as an Indiana congressman-turned-governor, such as restrictions on abortion and support for the overturn of Roe v. Wade. Palmetto Family most recently helped push through a ban on most South Carolina abortions, a law now being challenged in federal court.“We will stand with the right of every American, of every faith, to live, to work, to speak and to worship according to the dictates of their conscience," Pence said.Pence, who since leaving office has been doing work with the Heritage Foundation and Young America’s Foundation, has not indicated if he plans a future run. As vice president, he made numerous trips to South Carolina, meeting several times with Gov. Henry McMaster for coronavirus-related forums and campaigning in the state for U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham and U.S. Rep. Nancy Mace.But the question is whether Pence's former boss still looms large for the possible Republican field. Trump has not explicitly stated his plans but has teased a possible bid. On Thursday morning, asked on Fox Business about running in 2024, Trump said he’s “100%” thinking about it and would even possibly consider Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis as his running mate.Last month, another possible GOP contender, former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley, said when asked about 2024 by The Associated Press that she would stand down if Trump opted to run again. Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has launched an aggressive schedule, visiting states that will play a pivotal role in the 2024 primaries and signing a contract with Fox News Channel. DeSantis has been courting donors, including in Trump’s backyard, with a prominent speaking slot before the former president at a GOP fundraising retreat dinner this month at Mar-a-Lago, the Florida resort where Trump now lives.Earlier Thursday, South Carolina Democratic Chair Trav Robertson said Pence was coming to the state to "try and salvage his relationship” with Trump supporters irked that Pence didn't support efforts to block certification of the 2020 presidential election.On Thursday, Pence promised to reveal more of his ideas soon, promising that he would be challenging the Biden administration's “avalanche of liberal policies” as he ramps up speaking engagements around the country.“We have the winning agenda,” Pence told Thursday's crowd. “And now it's incumbent upon us to take that winning agenda to the American people.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eying-2024-mike-pence-makes-1st-speech-since-leaving-office-101619752071647.html
30-04-2021||World||US pushes ahead with nuclear plans despite watchdog concerns||The Biden administration appears to be picking up where former President Donald Trump left off as the federal agency that oversees U.S. nuclear research and bomb-making has approved the conceptual design and cost range for infrastructure investments for a multibillion-dollar project to manufacture key components for the nation’s nuclear arsenal.The National Nuclear Security Administration in a decision announced Wednesday stated that planning and construction could cost upwards of $4 billion initially.The agency did not articulate what exactly that money would be spent on nor does it include the cost of other preparations that would be needed for Los Alamos National Laboratory to begin producing 30 plutonium cores per year.The push to resume production of the nuclear triggers has spanned multiple presidential administrations, with supporters arguing that the U.S. needs to ensure the stability and reliance of its arsenal given growing global security concerns. The nuclear agency also has said most of the cores in the stockpile date back to the 1970s and 1980s.Lab Director Thom Mason during a virtual community meeting Thursday evening fielded several questions about the project, saying the goal of the work is not to expand the arsenal but rather to extend the life of the existing stockpile.While not everyone agrees with everything the lab does, he said nuclear deterrence and nonproliferation will remain the lab's primary mission.He also pointed to current geopolitical threats.“I think we all wish that we lived in a world where nuclear weapons weren’t necessary,” he said. “But as long as we’re not in that world, the responsibility that we’re given by the Department of Defense, by Congress, by the Department of Energy is to make sure that our deterrent is safe, secure and reliable.”Democratic members of New Mexico's congressional delegation have supported production at Los Alamos because of the billions of dollars in federal funding and thousands of jobs that are at stake.But watchdog groups have been sounding alarms over the potential for more security and safety lapses at the northern New Mexico lab and the potential for environmental contamination. Another concern is the nuclear waste that would be generated by the work.The groups have said the cost estimate outlined by the agency in its decision is roughly double the projections made just last year.Greg Mello with the Los Alamos Study Group said the ballooning budget and uncertainty over whether the lab can meet the federal government's mandated production schedule “throw further doubt on the wisdom of proceeding with industrial pit production” at Los Alamos.“LANL’s facilities are simply too old and inherently unsafe, its location too impractical,” he said. “Even with a much smaller stockpile, LANL could not undertake this mission successfully.”Some groups have threatened to sue the U.S. Energy Department and the National Nuclear Security Administration, saying a more comprehensive review should have been done on the plans to produce plutonium cores at Los Alamos and at the Savannah River Site in South Carolina. They argue that nearby communities already have been saddled with legacy contamination from previous defense work.Critics are fearful that the project will result in factories that resemble the Rocky Flats facility in Colorado, which had a long history of leaks, fires and environmental violations and needed a $7 billion cleanup that took years to finish.The mission of producing the plutonium cores began at Rocky Flats in the 1950s and was eventually moved to Los Alamos in the late 1990s.Dogged by safety problems and concerns about a lack of accountability, production at Los Alamos has happened in fits and starts over the years. It’s been shut down at times, and only a handful of prototypes were made in fiscal year 2019.Jay Coghlan of Nuclear Watch New Mexico called the federal government's plans “unnecessary and provocative,” saying more production will result in more waste and help to fuel a new arms race.The nuclear agency in a statement said it expects to set cost and schedule baselines in 2023 as part of the ongoing process. It also plans to continue reviewing the project “to improve the fidelity” of price and timeline estimates.Mason said the 2021 fiscal year is certainly a record in terms of funding for the lab, with the operating budget projected to be more than $3.7 billion. That funding will likely level off in the coming years, he said, as more modernization and infrastructure projects are completed. He said future funding will depend on the administration's focus and congressional action.Mason also used Thursday's community meeting to highlight the lab's other work — which includes projects related to space exploration, the pandemic, water supplies in the West and wildfires.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-pushes-ahead-with-nuclear-plans-despite-watchdog-concerns-101619749752617.html

The callers then instructed the victims to mail cash to aliases used by other members of the fraud network, including Patel and Dave, they said.“These convictions should stand as a warning that my office will aggressively investigate and work to hold those accountable who collect and transmit money from Social Security imposter scam victims,” said Gail S Ennis, Inspector General for the Social Security Administration.“International call centres continue to victimise the elderly and most vulnerable members of our community,” said acting US Attorney Kurt R Erskine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indianamerican-couple-sentenced-for-laundering-over-500k-in-phone-scam-101619743827338.html
30-04-2021||World||US President Joe Biden says tax hikes on rich will fund cuts for many more||President Joe Biden told voters in an Atlanta suburb that his proposed tax increases on the wealthy would finance tax cuts for many more Americans, as he took to the road to sell his plans to build infrastructure and invest in education, child care and other priorities.“This is a tax cut for more than two million families in Georgia,” Biden said of his proposals during a drive-in rally in Gwinnett County, marking his first 100 days in office.“It’s about time the very wealthy and corporations start paying their fair share,” he said. “It’s about time. Simple as that.”Biden traveled to the state -- a political battleground after major Democratic victories in November and January -- following his first address to a joint session of Congress on Wednesday. In the speech, he unveiled a sweeping $1.8 trillion proposal that would expand educational opportunities and child care for families, financed in part by the largest tax increases on wealthy Americans in decades.Biden defended the proposal – and a $2.25 trillion companion infrastructure plan that would be partly funded through higher corporate tax rates – as a “once in a generation investment in America” that would create millions of jobs.A 15% minimum “book tax” for US corporations, he said, would raise enough to “pay for all of this.”He also repeated a jab at the investment class included in his address to Congress. “Wall Street didn’t build this country,” he said. “You did. The middle class did. And unions built the middle class.”Biden was elected in part thanks to flipping Georgia to the Democratic column for the first time since 1992. Two Democrats, Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff, subsequently won a pair of runoff elections for the US Senate early this year, giving the party control of the chamber and allowing Biden to pass a $1.9 trillion relief measure without any Republican votes.“Because of you we passed one of the most consequential rescue bills in history,” Biden told his audience.The White House said more than 6.2 million adults in Georgia received stimulus checks thanks to the legislation, while the state received $8.6 billion in local and state fiscal relief.Biden had originally planned to hold his first rally in the state in March, but shootings in the Atlanta area that left eight people dead – six of whom were Asian women – led him to put off the event.Earlier Thursday, the president and first lady Jill Biden visited with Jimmy Carter and his wife, Rosalynn, at the former president’s home in Plains, Georgia. Jimmy Carter, 96, did not attend Biden’s inauguration because of health concerns during the coronavirus pandemic.The visit was closed to reporters accompanying the president and neither the Carters nor the Bidens spoke to the press afterward.Biden plans to continue promoting his spending proposals on Friday with a visit to Philadelphia’s 30th Street Station, where he’ll mark the 50th anniversary of Amtrak. When he was in the Senate, he regularly commuted from Delaware to Washington on the railroad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-president-joe-biden-says-tax-hikes-on-rich-will-fund-cuts-for-many-more-101619743532370.html

Just as India sent assistance to the United States when our hospitals were strained early in the pandemic, the United States is determined to help India and its time of need," Price added.White House Deputy Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters aboard Air Force One that the first assistance flights left the US for India on April 28.The planes carried the first tranche of the assistance, which includes oxygen cylinders, rapid diagnostic tests, and N95 masks to protect frontline workers, she said.Additional flights carrying the remaining assistance, including oxygen generators and concentrators, are scheduled to depart in the upcoming days, Jean-Pierre said.Responding to a question, Price said the rise in Covid-19 cases in India is a matter of concern.Since the start of this outbreak prior to the latest assistance, the United States had delivered some USD 19 million in support to India's public health system, he said."If we are to make progress against this current surge of cases in India, it can't be something that the Indian government tackles alone, it can't be something that the United States government tackles alone," the State Department spokesperson asserted."Everyone has a role to play, including the private sector, including the advocacy community, including civil society, and that's what you are seeking to do," Price said in response to another question.He added that the goal of both the Indian and the US governments is to ensure that this aid is put to immediate and effective use.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-hopes-its-covid-19-assistance-has-catalytic-effect-on-countries-coming-to-india-s-aid-101619742643866.html
30-04-2021||World||Five US agencies may have been hacked through Ivanti flaws||The US Department of Homeland Security has determined that flaws in Ivanti Inc.’s products may have allowed hackers to breach at least five federal agencies.The Department’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, known as CISA, has been working with organizations targeted through vulnerabilities in Ivanti’s Pulse Connect Secure products and required federal civilian agencies to run a tool designed to find them.“CISA is aware of at least five federal civilian agencies who have run the Pulse Connect Secure Integrity Tool and identified indications of potential unauthorized access,” Matt Hartman, a deputy executive assistant director at CISA, said Thursday in a statement. “We are working with each agency to validate whether an intrusion has occurred and will offer incident response support accordingly.”Hartman didn’t identify the agencies. Reuters previously reported the suspected breaches in federal agencies.Hartman’s statement comes a week after CISA released an Emergency Directive requiring agencies using Pulse Connect Secure virtual private networks and other products to take steps to find and mitigate possible breaches. It also comes after another major cyber-attack on the digital supply chain in which Russian hackers inserted malicious code in software updates for Texas-based SolarWinds Corp.Nine US agencies and at least 100 companies were breached by the Russian hackers in that attack, which was made public in December.The US hasn’t attributed the cyber-activity to a specific hacking group. However, the cybersecurity firm FireEye Inc. recently found that hackers -- suspected to be based in China -- were using Pulse Secure virtual private networks to hack into dozens of organizations for apparent espionage purposes, according to Charles Carmakal, a senior vice president and chief technology officer at FireEye, who spoke to Bloomberg News in an interview last week.The Chinese Embassy in Washington didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.Ivanti said in a statement that it was working closely with CISA and cybersecurity experts “to investigate and respond quickly to malicious activity that was identified on a very limited number of customer systems.”“The Pulse team took swift action to provide mitigations directly to the limited number of impacted customers that remediates the risk to their system, and we plan to issue a software update within the next few days,” the company said.Organizations targeted by the hackers through Pulse Secure flaws spanned financial services, government and defense contracting in the U.S. and Europe, Carmakal said. Since then, analysts at FireEye have observed additional victims including transportation, energy, professional services and telecommunications organizations.“This is a pretty big deal from a national security perspective,” Carmakal said in the interview. He said there has been a significant spike in China-linked hacking in the U.S. this year, including widespread attacks that leveraged flaws in Microsoft Corp.’s Exchange software for email.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/five-us-agencies-may-have-been-hacked-through-ivanti-flaws-101619743009056.html
30-04-2021||World||We’re not to blame for border tensions with India, says Chinese defence ministry||Beijing is not responsible for the current border friction with India, the Chinese defence ministry said on Thursday even as it warned New Delhi against teaming up with foreign powers to make a show of its maritime strength.New Delhi has repeatedly dismissed Beijing’s attempts to blame India for the ongoing border tensions in eastern Ladakh, saying the People’s Liberation Army’s (PLA) troops were the first to illegally trespass across the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in May last year.The Chinese foreign and defence ministries, however, have continued to blame the Indian Army for crossing the LAC.“Regarding the situations in the western section of the China-India boundary, China has explained the ins and outs in detail, and the responsibility does not lie with China,” Senior Colonel Wu Qian, Chinese defence ministry spokesperson, said on Thursday.Wu was responding to a question on a comment made by India’s Chief of Defence Staff General Bipin Rawat at the Raisina Dialogue earlier this month, where he said India had stood firm in preventing a change of status quo on the northern borders and New Delhi proved it will not get pushed under any pressure, in context of the border tensions with China.Wu “rebutted” Rawat’s statement, China’s official military portal reported. “The relevant remarks by the Indian side are completely inconsistent with the facts,” Wu said.Wu said that because of the joint efforts of China and India, the border defence troops of both sides have recently disengaged from contact in the Galwan Valley and Pangong Lake areas, and the situation in the border area has eased.Wu added that India will “cherish the hard-won situation” and work with China to safeguard peace and tranquility in the border areas.Wu also warned against “ganging up” against China in context of the “La Pérouse” naval exercise held in the Bay of Bengal in the first week of April.India and three other members of the Quad - the US, Australia and Japan - took part in the three-day drill led by France.Wu said China had taken note of the exercise and hopes that countries involved in it would do more things conducive to peace and stability “instead of forming gangs” to show off their military power and to promote regional militarisation.The La Pérouse, a multilateral joint naval exercise, was a training drill involving five countries in which eight ships took part.The defence ministry spokesperson’s statement on an exercise held in the Bay of Bengal gives an idea about Beijing’s ambitions about its maritime power and reach.His comments come days after China launched three large warships on the same day -the Hainan, China’s first Type 075 amphibious assault ship; the Dalian, a large destroyer; and the Changzheng 18, a nuclear-powered strategic ballistic missile submarine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/were-not-to-blame-for-border-tensions-with-india-says-chinese-defence-ministry-101619724644684.html
30-04-2021||India||MP Panchayats seal 200 villages to stop entry of migrant workers||Panchayats in Madhya Pradesh have stopped the entry of outsiders and migrant workers into at least 200 villages for the past one week by sealing borders and setting up quarantine centres to prevent the spread of Covid-19 as 15-20% of fresh infections in the state were reported from rural areas, officials said. The proportion of infections reported from villages has gone up by nearly four times as it was below 5% in September, according to the state rural development department’s data.In order to curb the rising cases, panchayats have sealed several villages in Bundelkhand, Malwa and central regions as migrant workers began returning to their homes amid curfews and shutdowns imposed by several states and cities. On Friday, Madhya Pradesh reported 12,400 cases and 97 deaths, taking the overall tally to 466,915 and 5,616, respectively. There are as many as 92,077 active cases in the state. The second wave has pushed daily infections above the 350,000-mark daily across the country. As several returnees tested positive for Covid-19, panchayats made it mandatory for them to quarantine for 14 days across various centres set up by them before entering the villages. Officials said in Hoshangabad district alone, 130 villages were sealed for one month after a sharp surge in cases 10 days ago.Shivram Katare, panchayat secretary in Hoshangabad’s Dongarwada village, said in some cases, the entire family was found to be infected in neighbouring villages. “...as many as six people died of Covid 19. So, we have decided to seal the village and we are happy that no one has tested positive of Covid-19. The village has a population of over 2,000 people and many returned from the cities after the lockdown... they are at quarantine centres where we are providing food and other facilities,” Katare said. Several village panchayats have formed vigilance committees to check the entry of outsiders. “It is hard to seal the borders of a village... We have used bamboo and ropes to seal the village. We have also formed a vigilance team of 20 people to check the entry of people into the village,” Meshram Singh, a resident of Bari village in Chhatarpur district, said. Dhani Ram Gupta, a social worker from Sagar district’s Kevlari Kalan village, said not only have they sealed the border but were also extending help to those infected. “In our village, two youth returned from Sagar city and tested positive. We shifted them to a hospital and also provided all kinds of help to their families. The basic objective of doing this is to set an example for villagers that they should not be afraid if they develop any symptom. We will not discriminate against those who will test positive; we will take care of them,” Gupta said. Hoshangabad collector Dhananjay Pratap Singh said teams that include auxiliary nurses were helping villagers in screening outsiders. “We will win this battle through community support, and we are happy that villagers are coming forward on their own,” he said. Chhatrapur collector Sheelendra Singh said that unlike last year, villagers are taking the pandemic seriously. “They are showing alertness this time as the number of positive cases in rural areas has increased,” Singh said. Panchayat and rural development department principal secretary Umakant Umrao said since there is no nationwide lockdown, people were returning to their villages using public transport. “So, there are chances of the spread of the infection. In the past two weeks, 75,000 people have returned to their villages. Panchayats have developed about 15,000 quarantine and Covid care centres in the villages by using their funds. Our focus is to contain the spread of the infections in rural areas, and we are hopeful of success.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mppanchayats-seal-200-villages-to-stop-entry-of-migrant-workers-101619807268756.html
30-04-2021||India||Mumbai cops, bookie part of Vaze’s plan to kill Hiran: NIA||Mumbai Mumbai Police officers Sunil Mane and Riyazuddin Kazi, former policeman Vinayak Shinde and cricket bookie Naresh Gor were part of main accused Sachin Vaze’s alleged larger conspiracy to eliminate Thane auto parts dealer Mansukh Hiran, the National Investigation Agency (NIA) has claimed. The federal agency made the claim while opposing Gor’s bail plea on Friday and stated that the SIM cards used by Vaze were provided by the bookie. It added that the mobile phone on which Hiran was called was purchased by Vaze and the SIM in it was provided by Gor, said NIA. The federal agency further claimed that if released, Gor could jump the bail and tamper with the evidence. Gor approached the special NIA court for bail, claiming that he was never contacted by Vaze, an assistant Mumbai Police inspector, who is under suspension. Gor in his bail plea filed through law firm, Diamondwala & Co, claimed that he has been made a scapegoat by the investigating agency at the instance of Vaze. He has also claimed that he was not aware of any conspiracy or the purpose for which the SIM cards were going to be used. The 31-year-old cricket bookie was arrested by the Maharashtra anti-terrorism squad on March 21, after it started investigating Hiran’s murder. Later, his custody was handed over to NIA, when the federal agency took over the case from ATS. According to NIA, Hiran’s murder was linked to the explosive-laden Scorpio found parked near industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s south Mumbai residence Antilia. On February 25, the Scorpio was found abandoned near Antilia with 20 loose gelatin sticks and a threatening note, and a case was registered with Gamdevi police station on the same day. Vaze was originally investigating the case, but was removed after reports emerged of his links with Hiran, who was in possession of the SUV and had reported it stolen on February 17. Hiran was found dead in a creek on March 5. It subsequently emerged that Vaze had borrowed the car in November and returned it on February 5. NIA took over the explosives case on March 8 and Vaze was arrested on March 13. The federal agency took over the murder case on March 24 and Vaze was named the main accused in both the cases. To contain the damage, the Maharashtra government transferred police commissioner Param Bir Singh for his alleged management of the case. He subsequently wrote a letter to the chief minister alleging that the then home minister Anil Deshmukh had instructed Vaze and some other Mumbai Police officers to extort ₹100 crore from bars and restaurants, hookah parlours. When no action was forthcoming, Singh approached the courts. The Bombay high court eventually asked the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to conduct a preliminary enquiry into the matter, prompting Deshmukh’s resignation. Accordingly, CBI conducted an inquiry and registered an offence against Deshmukh on April 21.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mumbai-cops-bookie-part-of-vaze-s-plan-to-kill-hiran-nia-101619807148744.html
30-04-2021||India||CBI submits interim report in Anil Deshmukh case||Mumbai: The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Friday filed an interim report of its preliminary enquiry into corruption allegations against former Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh made by former Mumbai police chief Param Bir Singh.A senior CBI officer said the report is based on the evidence collected so far during various search operations and on the basis of statements of several witnesses. The agency moved an application before the special CBI court on Friday , seeking permission to submit the report. The court accepted the report filed in a sealed envelope.On April 21, the central agency registered a case against Deshmukh under sections 7 of the Prevention of Corruption Act and 120B of the Indian Penal Code. The first information report (FIR), based on Singh’s allegations, came after CBI was ordered to conduct a preliminary enquiry by the Bombay high court on April 5. Singh took legal recourse after his March 20 letter to the chief minister and the governor, alleging that Deshmukh ordered Mumbai police assistant inspector Sachin Vaze to extort money from restaurants and bars. His complaint came after he was removed as commissioner for his handling of the Antilla explosives case. An SUV laden with explosives (20 loose sticks of gelatin; no timer or detonator) was found parked outside billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s residence, Antilia, in south Mumbai on February 25. Vaze, who was part of the Mumbai crime branch, was initially lead investigator in the case. However, after a Thane-based businessman linked to the car, turned up dead, Vaze was transferred out of his department. He was later arrested by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) as prime suspect in the explosives case. He has also been named suspect in the murder investigation of the businessman, Mansukh Hiran.Deshmukh, a leader of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), and the Shiv Sena-led Maharashtra government sought to brazen out the issue initially as Singh approached the Supreme Court seeking a CBI investigation into the alleged extortion racket. The top court refused to intervene and said Singh could approach the high court. Deshmukh resigned citing moral grounds after the high court asked the CBI to conduct the preliminary inquiry within 15 days and left it to the discretion of the agency’s director to decide the further course of action.In its FIR, CBI claimed, “The preliminary enquiry prima facie revealed that a cognisable offence was made out in the matter, wherein the then home minister of Maharashtra Shri Anil Deshmukh and unknown others have attempted to obtain undue advantage for improper and dishonest performance of their public duty.”“The enquiry has also revealed that Shri Sachin Vaze, assistant police inspector, Mumbai Police, had been reinstated into the police force after being out of the service for more than 15 years. The enquiry further revealed that Shri Vaze was entrusted with most of the sensational and important cases of Mumbai Police and at the then home minister’s knowledge,” read the FIR. It also mentioned the allegations made by Singh against Deshmukh.A day after registering the FIR, CBI conducted searches at Deshmukh’s premises in Mumbai and his home town Nagpur. CBI also obtained records of investigation and evidence gathered from Vaze by National Investigation Agency (NIA) which is probing the Antilia explosives case. The agency has also recorded statements of several people, including Deshmukh, his personal assistant, secretary and some police officers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mumbai-cops-bookie-part-of-vaze-s-plan-to-kill-hiran-nia-101619806968748.html
30-04-2021||India||Environment ministry eases norms for industry expansion||The environment ministry has allowed companies operating in several industries, including some polluting ones, to expand capacities on the basis of a self-certification that this will not “increase the pollution load”, creating the room for potential misdeclaration (and misuse), especially in light of a traditionally poor monitoring regime. Earlier this week, the ministry released a user manual for online submission of an undertaking on no increase in pollution load due to expansion, on its Parivesh website.This follows a notification issued by the ministry on March 2 which states that the Centre deems it necessary to permit increase in production capacity of processing, production and manufacturing sector with or without any change in raw material-mix or product-mix or any change in configuration of the plant without the requirement of prior environmental clearance provided that there is no increase in pollution load. The March 2 notification is applicable to industries such as coal washing, mineral processing, pesticides, fertilizers, synthetic chemicals such as paint, cement , petrochemicals, and sugar, some of which do have a significant environmental footprint. The motivation behind the notification isn’t clear. . However, the notification itself claimed the environment ministry has received several requests from processing, production and the manufacturing sector for permitting increase in production capacity without having to go through the entire environmental clearance process again. Independent experts said this could mean benefitting most polluting industries who may already have a very large pollution footprint.The Centre amended the EIA (environmental impact assessment) notification 2006 on November 23, 2016 and January 16, 2020 providing flexibility. The 2016 and 2020 amendments introduced the principles of “no increase in pollution load” and exemption from seeking environment clearance if resultant increase of production capacity was less than 50%. This applied to a change in product mix, change in quantities within products, or number of products within the same category of industry. The March 2021 notification takes this further and allows any amount of expansion.The manual on the Parivesh website provides a questionnaire and provisions for uploading documents on expansion and an undertaking that the expansion will not lead to increase in pollution load. Industries will also have to upload a “no increase in pollution load certificate” from an environmental auditor or institutions empanelled by the State Pollution Control Board or Central Pollution Control Board or Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change.If on verification, the CPCB or SPCB , after giving the project proponent the opportunity of being heard, holds that such expansion or modernisation results in increase in pollution load, the exemption claimed under the clause shall become invalid. Also, such an exemption will be applicable if the industry installs Online Continuous Monitoring System (OCMS) with at least 95% uptime, connected to the servers of the CPCB or SPCBs.“The ease of “no increase in pollution load” was introduced to the environment clearance process from 2016, to gradually exempt project expansions from the purview of carrying out impact assessments or public hearings. Until now, this exemption was applicable up to 50% expansion. The new amendment has ensured that expansion of some of the most polluting industrial operations, i.e.chemical fertilizers, coal washing, mineral processing, petroleum refining, asbestos and cement production, can be carried provided a “no increase in pollution load certificate” can be produced by the project authorities,” said Kanchi Kohli, legal researcher, Centre for Policy Research.“Prior to these exemptions, the environmental performance and legal compliance with environmental safeguards had direct consequences for whether expansions could be allowed. These units would also require a public hearing. All these would allow affected people to weigh in legitimacy of the expansion and allow the environment ministry to assess the such legacy impacts, existing illegalities and conduct of project proponents. None of this will be required for all the projects operations granted exemptions through this amendment irrespective of its capacity,” she added.“The notification will cover certain industries covered in the schedule to the EIA notification 2006. The process is very clear. The industries can self-certify through their consultants but if they are found erring by the pollution control boards their environmental clearance will be invalid,” a senior environment ministry official said on condition of anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/environment-ministry-eases-norms-for-industry-expansion-101619806908736.html

30-04-2021||India||Jaishankar emphasises importance of China’s transport corridors in India’s Covid-19 response||External affairs minister S Jaishankar on Friday emphasised to his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi the importance of China’s transport corridors and cargo flights remaining open to facilitate the movement of materials needed for India’s Covid-19 response.During a phone conversation organised at the request of the Chinese side, Jaishankar also told Wang that the process of disengagement of Indian and Chinese forces along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) remained “unfinished” and should be “completed at the earliest”.The Indian side is yet to take a call on China’s offer of support to fight a devastating second wave of Covid-19 infections that has surged well past the 350,000-mark for the past several days. The Chinese leadership has said it will facilitate clearances and logistics for shipping equipment and other supplies to India, though the recent suspension of services by Sichuan Airlines raised a question mark about the movement of cargo from China.While speaking to Wang, Jaishankar said Indian entities were commercially procuring products and raw materials required for the Covid-19 response from suppliers in China. Jaishankar said “this process would be facilitated if various transport corridors and cargo flights remained open and the necessary logistics support [was] ensured expeditiously,” according to a statement from the external affairs ministry. Jaishankar also said challenges, such as the pandemic, require “serious international cooperation”. Wang described Covid-19 as a common enemy and agreed on the need for coordination on a concerted response. He said China supports India’s efforts and will ensure that all the required materials “flow to Indian entities without any delay”. Chinese companies will be supported to deliver the materials, and airports, customs and airlines will be instructed to smoothly facilitate the movement of goods, he said. Chartered flights from India will be welcome and specific problems raised by the Indian side will be sorted out quickly. Wang also offered any other assistance required from the Chinese government.Jaishankar and Wang discussed “outstanding issues related to disengagement from all friction points” along the LAC in eastern Ladakh. “External affairs minister conveyed that while the process of disengagement had commenced earlier this year, it remained unfinished. He emphasised that this process needed to be completed at the earliest. Full restoration of peace and tranquillity in the border areas would enable progress in the bilateral relationship,” the statement said. The two ministers agreed to continue the dialogue at the official level on this matter.Indian and Chinese troops have been engaged in a standoff on the LAC for almost a year. Though both sides pulled back troops and armoured formations from the north and south banks of Pangong Lake in February, the disengagement process stalled after that and there has been no headway in recent talks.Jaishankar and Wang also had a brief discussion on the meetings of foreign ministers of the Brazil-Russia-India-China-South Africa (Brics) and Russia-India-China (RIC) groupings, which are scheduled to be held in the near future under the Indian chair. Wang confirmed his participation at these events.The call was arranged at the request of the Chinese side to convey solidarity with India, hours after Chinese President Xi Jinping sent a message of sympathy to Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Xi said he was “very concerned” about the Covid-19 situation in India and that the Chinese side was ready to strengthen cooperation with India in fighting the pandemic and providing help.Jaishankar thanked Wang for his sentiments and informed him of India’s efforts to meet the challenge posed by the second wave of the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jaishankar-emphasises-importance-of-china-s-transport-corridors-in-india-s-covid-19-response-101619802889189.html

Doctors answer||New mothers who have tested positive for Covid-19 can breastfeed their child as there is no evidence so far that the infection can spread through mothers' milk, but some precautions have to be followed, doctors said on Friday. The Press Information Bureau organised a webinar where doctors busted several myths regarding the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). Dr Nitin Yashas, senior resident, Medical Oncology at Manipal Hospital, Bangalore, said lactating mothers, should wear a mask while breastfeeding so that the virus can not be transmitted through the regular route of respiratory droplets. An N-95 mask, a face shield has been advised for lactating mothers as it's not advisable to put masks (covering the nose) on the child."It is not advisable to use a mask on newborns unless they are of at least two years of age. That can lead to other paediatric or respiratory problems," Dr Rahul Kulkarni, MD and intensivist at Sahyadri Hospital in Pune said.With the advent of the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, people are quickly believing in WhatApp forwards and social media rumours. Through doctors, the Centre is cautioning people to not fall for unscientific claims. In his last Mann ki Baat too, Prime Minister Narendra Modi emphasised trusting only verified sources of information.Does drinking warm water prevent Covid-19?Dr Yashas said warm water brings a placebo effect that it is relieving the symptoms, but scientifically it does not kill coronavirus. "In laboratory settings, you need a temperature of 60-75 degree Celsius to kill the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Now, the human body temperature is around 37 degree Celsius. These viruses remain within body cells and the human body maintains a temperature of around 37 degree Celsius," he said adding that the core temperature does not change while taking a hot water bath or while drinking warm water.Doctors answer queries in Webinar on '#COVID19: Myths Vs Reality’"Don’t go into the details of any anti-viral medication. Just stick to the advice of your physician"- Appeal from doctorsFor answers to your doubts 👉https://t.co/CAlEIRasDu#Unite2FightCorona pic.twitter.com/lXbZSgNwMQCan Covid-19 be transmitted from pregnant mother to child?"Even if it happens, it is very difficult to assess whether it is vertical transmission from or the baby acquired infection from somewhere else. The rate of infection in pregnancy has gone to the higher side in the last 15 months, like in every other patient. 93-95% of these patients are mild cases. No need to panic about it. But, if the patient is at risk, that is have some immuno-compromises (like hypertension, diabetes etc) or in the higher side of age (40 and above), then they may land up in some sort of complications, mostly from Covid Pneumonia," Dr Kulkarni said.Does taking antibiotics help?Dr Chaitanya H Balakrishnan, the Covid coordinator at St John’s Medical College Hospital, Bangalore, said giving antibiotics as a preventive measure has no role. "A couple of studies in the UK and also Delhi has shown that injudicious use of antibiotics may rather increase the hospital stay or cause mortality in such patients. So, the tendency to take an over-the-counter azithromycin is completely unadvisable. If you are suspecting that you have symptoms of COVID, get tested, meet a COVID Care physician and take the appropriate step. Use of antibiotics in COVID-19 is completely avoidable. Taking an over-the-counter or Dr Google prescribed antibiotic is a complete no-no in COVID cases," he said,Dr Kulkarni said patients should not forward their prescription to others as every case is different.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/can-covid-positive-mothers-breastfeed-child-doctors-answer-101619799893577.html
30-04-2021||India||Military gets emergency financial powers to meet India’s Covid-19 challenge||Defence minister Rajnath Singh on Friday granted emergency financial powers to the military to strengthen and accelerate its efforts to deal with the crisis posed by the coronavirus disease pandemic even as the Indian Navy dispatched its warships to foreign shores to bring back liquid oxygen filled cryogenic containers.“These (financial) powers will help formation commanders to establish and operate quarantine facilities/hospitals and undertake procurement/repair of equipment/items/material/stores, besides provisioning of various services and works required to support the ongoing effort against the pandemic,” the defence ministry said in a statement.While vice chiefs of armed forces including Chief of Integrated Defence Staff to the Chairman Chiefs of Staff Committee (CISC) and army commanders (and their equivalent ranks in the navy and air force) have been given “full powers”, corps commanders and area commanders have been delegated powers to spend up to ₹50 lakh each.While the statement did not elaborate on financial powers given to the vice chiefs and others, ministry officials said “full powers” implied that finances should not come in the way of mounting a robust response to the pandemic. Division commanders/sub area commanders and their equivalent ranks in the navy and air force have been delegated powers to spend up to ₹20 lakh per case. Such powers were sanctioned last year too when the pandemic first broke out.“These powers have been devolved initially for a period of three months, from May 1 to July 31, 2021,” the statement said. These powers are in addition to the emergency powers granted to the military’s medical officers last week.On April 23, Singh granted emergency buying powers to senior military doctors as part of the ministry’s overall plan to fight the outbreak. While the heads of the medical wings of the three services were given powers to make purchases worth ₹5 crore, doctors holding the ranks of major general and brigadier were allowed to make procurements worth ₹3 crore and ₹2 crore, respectively.Prime Minister Narendra Modi has reviewed the military’s preparations for Covid relief thrice this week in one-on-one meetings with the chief of defence staff, the Indian Air force chief and the army chief.As part of the steps being taken by the armed forces to fight the outbreak, the navy on Friday launched Operation Samudra Setu-II and dispatched warships to Bahrain, Thailand and Singapore for shipment of oxygen filled cryogenic containers to India.“Two warships, INS Kolkata and INS Talwar. have entered port of Manama, Bahrain, for transporting 40MT of liquid oxygen to Mumbai. INS Jalashwa is enroute to Bangkok and INS Airavat to Singapore for similar missions,” navy spokesperson Commander Vivek Madhwal said.IAF is also making a significant contribution in the fight against Covid by transporting much-needed empty oxygen containers to filling stations across the country. It has been involved in ferrying empty cryogenic oxygen containers to filling centres in India from different domestic locations and even abroad to help hospitals tide over the oxygen crisis.IAF chief Air Chief Marshal RKS Bhadauria told PM Narendra Modi on April 28 that he has ordered 24x7 readiness of the IAF’s entire heavy-lift fleet and substantial numbers of its medium-lift fleet to operate in a hub and spoke model to swiftly meet all Covid-related tasking across the country and overseas.“As of April 29, IAF has carried out 23 sorties from abroad, airlifting 39 oxygen containers with a capacity of 670 MT. Within the country, it carried out 124 sorties, airlifting 87 containers with a capacity of 1,798 MT. On Friday, IAF carried out 10 domestic sorties to help meet oxygen requirements,” said an IAF official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/military-gets-emergency-financial-powers-to-meet-india-s-covid-challenge-101619797668872.html

Not all states have updated the portals,” she said on whether all Apollo centres will offer vaccination for people in the 18-44 age group from May 1.“The vaccination programme will begin with limited quantities and be ramped up in the weeks ahead. Apollo hospitals will be organizing special camps for corporates. The vaccines would be priced as per the guidelines issued by the central government,” the statement read.Serum Institute of India (SII), which manufactures Covishield, had earlier announced that a single dose of its vaccine for private hospitals and institutions would cost ₹600. Bharat Biotech, which produces Covaxin, has set the cost of a single dose at ₹1,200 for private hospitals and institutions.According to reports, Max Healthcare will also open up vaccination for people in the 18-44 age group. There is, however, no formal statement from the group yet.On April 19, the central government announced that it will open up Covid-19 vaccination for everyone 18 years and above from May 1 as part of a liberalised and accelerated phase 3 strategy of Covid-19 vaccination in the country. The decision was taken in a high-level meeting chaired by Prime minister Narendra Modi.Currently, high risk people above 45 years are being given the vaccine for free under the national Covid-19 immunisation programme of the central government. The Centre’s guidelines say that from May 1, the Centre will procure 50% of the country’s vaccine supplies, and the remaining will be up for sale for the state governments and private hospitals and institutions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/apollo-hospitals-to-start-limited-covid-vaccination-in-some-cities-tomorrow-101619796408732.html

Vidyasagar, head of a government-appointed group of scientists modelling the trajectory of infections, told Reuters.The group previously told senior government officials in a presentation on April 2 that cases would peak between May 5-10, said Vidyasagar."We said (at that presentation) that it was not a matter of putting up some structures that would come up in July or August, because by then the wave will have ended," he said."Try to figure out how we're going to fight the fight for the next four to six weeks, that was the message. Don’t waste a lot of time putting up long-term solutions because your problem is right now."India's first wave of the pandemic peaked in mid-September with 97,894 cases. The country is now reporting more than three times as many infections daily, taking the total number of cases to 18.8 million with 208,000 deaths.The real number of infections is believed to be 50 times more, said Vidyasagar, as many people who contract the disease show no symptoms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indias-covid-19-cases-may-peak-next-week-say-scientists-101619793421699.html

At that time, it can't be transmitted to another person, he said. But the dead virus, or the particles of the dead virus, can be picked up by the RT-PCR test and a positive report still may come, when a person has become free from covid. "It is scientifically proved that the virus in mild cases dies after six or seven days," Dr Guleria said. In its new guidelines for Covid treatment under home isolation, the Centre has said Covid-19 patients have to remain in isolation for 10 days. After this period is over, the isolation period can be ended provided there is no fever for three days.No need for Covid testing after home isolation is over: Centre's new guidelineThe Union health ministry on Friday briefed about the steps taken to address the rising cases of Covid-19 in the country and the issue of oxygen shortage.

Then there are people who are thinking they will surely die because they came in contact with an infected person. They also think they need to stock Remdesivir and oxygen cylinder in case they test positive. "Then there are people who are aware and alert.

In addition, he raised the wide news coverage on the court’s oral statements made on April 26 that the EC was singularly responsible for the second wave, for not taking action against political rallies that didn’t follow Covid-19 norms and stating that its officials should probably be booked for murder.Dwivedi sought the court to direct media houses to confine their reports to observations recorded in orders or judgments and to refrain from reporting on oral observations made during court proceedings.In its order later that day, the court had toned down its criticism against the election body and this statement didn’t make it. It pertained to a case filed by Tamil Nadu transport minister MR Vijayabhaskar seeking safe and fair counting on May 2 since his constituency, Karur, has 77 candidates. On Friday, the court disposed of this petition in view of the measures taken by the EC and continued hearing the suo moto case.In an affidavit, the EC had contended that this statement has caused prejudice to the EC, adding and based on the statements, police complaints were being filed against the election body. To this, the bench said, “Courts are there and such frivolous matters will be dealt with.”On the matter of preparedness to deal with the surge in Covid-19 cases, the court suggested the state conducts extensive drives for vaccinations, put up information on the internet and other mediums so that people don’t panic while seeking drugs, beds and oxygen. Political parties, media were directed to follow pandemic norms and not burst crackers as part of their victory celebrations.The matter has been adjourned to May 5.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/frivolous-matters-madras-hc-on-ec-s-plea-to-restrain-media-from-publishing-oral-observations-101619790649287.html

In a letter issued by the land revenue department’s land records and survey directorate on Wednesday, all officers in districts have been asked to attend the review meeting, held online every fortnight, with information about progress of ongoing land survey related work. The letter also asks district revenue and settlement officers to hold online review meetings with officials posted at the camps in villages for updates on survey work. The emphasis has also been that survey work should be carried as per targets.

Field officers are also working with great risk.Is it feasible to interact with people at village level for different aspects of survey work to complete pending works?,” asked a settlement officer, requesting anonymity. Reports said in Munger around 25% of the total officers engaged in survey work, including amins, have been infected. “Even villagers are refusing to cooperate in the survey work..many village heads have written to the department seeking suspension of the work. But what can we do?” said another survey officer, posted in the district. In Bihar, a survey to update land records is on in 90 circles covering 5,099 villages in 20 districts. The survey work is in different stages -- such as initial verification of boundaries, validation of tri-junction, kistawar (update of land maps based on aerial survey) and then update of land owners with maps of holdings. Commenting on the reported protests within the department, Jai Singh, director, land records and survey, said the letter issued to district settlement officers was in the context of holding online review meetings. “ Yes, the survey work is going on and has to be completed as per targets set. But we are not insisting on people to take up outdoor work right now. A lot work, such as uploading data and other documentation work, can be done in the office,” he said,. “We are only stressing on working in virtual mode,” he clarified.Bihar is among the 11 states that account for 78.18% of the countries active cases along with Maharashtra, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, Kerala, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Chhattisgarh, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, and West Bengal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bihar-revenue-dept-officers-upset-over-land-survey-work-under-covid-cloud-101619786688401.html

We've supported and enabled multiple state governments to set-up similar dedicated Covid-19 response accounts," it added.The massive rise in infections in the second wave of the pandemic has led to hospitals in several states reeling under a shortage of medical oxygen and beds. Social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter have emerged as a lifeline during this crisis, helping connect those looking for oxygen cylinders, hospital beds, plasma donors, and ventilators with possible donors.Twitter said it tackles Covid-19 misinformation based on the highest potential for harm using a combination of product, technology and human review. "As of March 1, 2021, following the update to our Covid-19 misleading information policy regarding misleading information about vaccines, we apply a label warning on Tweets that advance unsubstantiated rumours and disputed claims, as well as incomplete or out-of-context information about vaccines," it said. Tweets which advance harmful false or misleading narratives about Covid-19 vaccinations will continue to be removed, it added.Twitter noted that a global team of specialists are working round the clock to make it easy to find credible information on Twitter, and to limit the spread of potentially harmful and misleading content.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/twitter-says-will-engage-openly-constructively-on-govt-s-content-withholding-requests-101619784674248.html

But the problem for people with disabilities has increased manifold. A lot of labs are not doing home collection and then there are long queues for testing. It is impossible for a blind person to go and stand in a queue. Similarly, for vaccination and treatment, priority should be given to people with disabilities. We have received several complaints from across the country about the problems disabled face for getting their Covid-19 tests done or vaccination.”An official from the department of empowerment of persons with disabilities said that they have received similar representations from different organisations and activists from across the country.Rungta added, “We have written to both the health ministry and the department of empowerment of persons with disabilities.

Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray is likely to make the announcement today evening in his live address to the state on various social media platforms. State health minister Rajesh Tope said that Thackeray is keen on launching the drive on May 1 as the day is celebrated as Maharashtra state’s foundation day as well. “The chief minister intends to start the vaccination drive for the 18-44 age group in a limited way. It is because we celebrate May 1 as Maharashtra Day and the Centre also wants it to be started on the same day. The CM will share more details about his plans during his live address this evening,” Tope told reporters on Friday.Also Read | Third Covid wave may hit Maharashtra by July-Aug, warns UddhavExpanding the nationwide drive, the Centre threw open vaccination for all adults from May 1, asking the states to inoculate the 18-44 age group by procuring doses from the open market.Tope said that the state may start the drive with one centre in a district as they have very limited stock of vaccine doses. “Serum Institute of India has informed us that they can provide 1,400,000 -1,500,000 vials in May whereas Bharat Biotech said they can provide between 400,000 and 450,000 doses in the next month. Together, we are expecting to get around 1.8 million doses in May. Based on this, the state can start the drive at limited centres which may be limited to one in each district,” the health minister said.He said the state government wants to maintain consistency in holding the drive which depends upon the availability of the vaccine stock.On being asked if the state will then also the vaccination drive at private centres for 45 years and above age group, he said, “We will have to follow whatever directives the Centre issues. Today, we are running the vaccination drive for 45 years and above at 4,200 centres across the state but if the Centre wants no drive for that age group at private centres then that directive will have to be followed.” Elaborating, he said, “Those who are eligible for the second dose will be given the second jab. It can be done either at private centres or at the government-run centres by taking the record. There are two firms manufacturing vaccine doses. The Government of India has mandated that half of their production will go to the Centre and the rest will be divided among the state governments, private hospitals and industrial private hospitals. Now the question arises on what will happen if these (private) hospitals demand vaccine stock in big numbers. The Government of India may have to regulate this aspect as well. The Centre yet has to clarify these aspects.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-may-start-vaccination-drive-for-18-44-age-group-in-a-symbolic-way-101619779849257.html

Tamil Nadu health secretary Dr J Radhakrishnan, however, said people above 45 years of age will continue to be inoculated against Covid-19. He said that the state government is in touch with the Centre and the vaccine makers—Serum Institute of India and Bharat Biotech—regarding the issue.“Instead of waiting till tomorrow (and disappoint people), I wish to clarify (now) that we are unsure when and how much out of 1.5 crore doses of vaccine sought by Tamil Nadu, will arrive,” Radhakrishnan told news agency PTI.Also read | Karnataka tells citizens to not go for Phase 3 vaccination over doses' shortageOn April 28, the state government ordered the Tamil Nadu Medical Services Corporation (TNMSC) to procure 15 million doses of the Covid-19 vaccine to facilitate the free vaccination of all people above 18 years of age in the state. In the order, the government said, “All necessary steps are being taken as per the order of the chief minister for the free vaccination of people from 18 to 44 years of age from May 1.”The health secretary’s comments came as the government’s order is yet to be fulfilled.

He mentioned that an order for 15 million doses of the Covid-19 vaccine has been placed by the state government and is unsure about when this would be delivered.Several other states in the country have also hinted at a possible delay in beginning the third phase of the vaccination programme due to the shortage in the Covid-19 vaccine stock. Earlier in the day, Karnataka health minister Dr K Sudhakar said people would be notified after the state government gets confirmation from the Serum Institute of India in Pune. “We gave orders to SII, Pune for over 1 crore doses. But they are not prepared to give it to us from tomorrow.

The proportion of the infections reported from villages has gone up by four times while it was under 5% in September, according to the state rural development department’s data.The panchayats began sealing the villages in Bundelkhand, Malwa and central regions as migrant workers began returning to their homes in rural areas as lockdowns to check the second Covid-19 wave were imposed across the country. Many of the returnees have tested Covid-19 positive.Madhya Pradesh on Friday reported 12,762 cases and 95 deaths.There were 92,773 active cases in the state as the surge in infections has overwhelmed hospitals and triggered shortages of medical supplies and oxygen. The second Covid-19 wave has pushed daily infections above the 350,000-mark daily in the country.The panchayats have set up centres, where the returnees have to quarantine for 14 days before entering the villages after testing negative for the disease. Officials said in the Hoshangabad district alone, 130 villages have been sealed after Covid-19 cases were reported under the jurisdiction of over a dozen villages.Also Read | Will treat action against social media Covid appeals as ‘contempt of court’: SCShivram Katare, the secretary of the panchayat in Hoshangabad’s Dongarwada village, said entire families have been found infected in neighbouring villages. “...as many as six people died of Covid 19. So, we have decided to seal the village and we are happy that no one tested positive of Covid-19. The village has a population of over 2,000 people and many returned from the cities after the lockdown... they are at quarantine centres where we are providing food and other facilities.”Many village panchayats have formed vigilance committees to check the entry of outsiders. “It is hard to seal the borders of a village... We have used bamboos and ropes to seal the village. We have also formed a vigilance team of 20 people to check the entry of people into the village,” said Meshram Singh, a resident of Bari village in Chhatarpur district.Dhani Ram Gupta, a social worker from Sagar district’s Kevlari Kalan village, said they have not only sealed the border but were also extending help to people who have tested positive. “In our village, two youth returned from Sagar city and were tested positive. We shifted them to a hospital and also provided all kinds of help to their families. The basic objective of doing this is to set an example for villagers that they should not be afraid if they develop any symptom. We will not discriminate against those who will test positive; we will take care of them...”Hoshangabad collector Dhananjay Pratap Singh said teams that include auxillary nurses were helping the villagers in screening outsiders. “We will win this battle with community support, and we are happy that villagers are coming forward on their own.”Sheelendra Singh, the Chhatrapur collector, said, unlike last year, the villagers are not taking Covid-19 lightly. “They are showing alertness this time as the number of positive cases in rural areas has increased.”Panchayat and rural development department principal secretary Umakant Umrao said since there is no nationwide lockdown, people were returning to their villages using public transport. “So, there are chances of the spread of the infection. In the past two weeks, 75,000 people have returned to their villages. Panchayats have developed about 15,000 quarantine and Covid care centres in the villages by using their funds.

The first batch of 75,000 vials was expected on Friday and another 375,000 were scheduled to be imported before July.Remdesivir is one of the investigational drugs prescribed under restricted emergency use for treating Covid-19 patients in India. The World Health Organisation has said there is no evidence that the drug reduces mortality or obviates the need for ventilation among hospitalised patients. It has, however, been found to help those in the early stages of the infection.Also Read | Delhi’s fake Remdesivir injection racket: Two more arrested in Uttarakhand“HLL Lifecare Ltd, a government-owned company, has ordered 450,000 vials of Remedesivir. It is expected that Gilead Sciences Inc. USA will dispatch 75,000 to 100,000 vials in the next one or two days. Further, one hundred thousand quantities will also be supplied by May 15. Egypt-based EVA pharma will also supply almost 10,000 vials initially followed by 50,000 vials every 15 days or till July,” Union chemicals and fertilisers’ ministry said in a statement.“The daily supply of Remedesivir has gone up from 67,900 vials on 11th April to 2.09 lakh vials on 28th April 2021,” the government said in an advisory issued to states and Union Territories for the transportation of Remdesivir supplies.The government on April 11 put a moratorium on the export of the medicine to boost its availability in India. Its price was earlier capped at ₹3,500 per vial on April 17. The drug has been exempted from customs duties till October 31 along with Beta-cyclodextrin, an important component used in its manufacturing.Gilead Sciences on Tuesday announced it will donate 450,000 vials of Remdesivir to India and provide its voluntary licensing partners in the country with technical assistance to rapidly scale up the production of the drug.The surge of Covid-19 cases has overwhelmed hospitals and triggered a shortage of medicines and other critical supplies.Gilead Sciences has seven licensing partners in India, and they have significantly accelerated production of Remdesivir by scaling up their batch sizes, adding new manufacturing facilities and/or onboarding local contract manufacturers across the country.Randeep Guleria, the director of New Delhi’s All India Institute of Medical Sciences this week cited a US study and added it was shown that if given to moderate to severe patients, there is a chance hospital stay will reduce somewhat. “Therefore, stable patients who are in home isolation, with oxygen saturation of 94% and above, do not require Remdesivir. If mild cases take Remdesivir, then there is a chance of more harm than good. It is no magic bullet and should be given only to hospitalised patients.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-to-import-450-000-vials-of-remdesivir-first-consignment-expected-today-101619770607683.html

The updated protocol will encourage Judicious use of Drugs and is expected to contribute to rationalising demand,” the statement added.Foreign secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla told reporters Thursday that more than 40 countries have committed to sending vital medical aid, particularly oxygen supplies. The supplies from the US Britain, Russia, the UAE, Qatar, Australia and elsewhere include almost 550 oxygen-generating plants, more than 4,000 oxygen concentrators, 10,000 oxygen cylinders as well as 17 cryogenic tankers. Shringla also said that hundreds of thousands of doses of Covid-19 treatment drugs as well as raw materials to produce vaccines and remdesivir, were also being sent.

30-04-2021||India||Will treat action against social media Covid appeals as ‘contempt of court’: SC||The Supreme Court on Friday said no state can register a first information report (FIR) or take any action against people appealing for help or putting out their grievances on social media or elsewhere during the coronavirus pandemic. "We will treat this as contempt of our court. Let us hear the voices of our citizens and not clampdown," the top court said.“It is a grave concern to me as a citizen or judge. If citizens communicate their grievances on social media, we do not want to clamp down on information,” Justice DY Chandrahud said during the hearing as cases of Covid-19 surged across the country.The top court also said that the healthcare infrastructure has been inherited in the last 70 years and so the proceedings are not to criticise the Centre or states. "We are concerned only about the health of the people and it is not to pass a value judgment," Chandrachud said. He also said that the Centre should show investment by it to ramp up the manufacture of vaccines. “This will be the most important intervention by the central government when private manufacturers have been funded to produce vaccines,” he added.Solicitor General (SG) Tushar Mehta said Delhi has been unable to lift oxygen because of lack of tankers. Justice Chandrachud said, "According to you, Delhi hasn't been able to lift but we can't tell people that your parents or children or spouse can't be helped now. You tell us the solution."The SG explained that the Centre is assisting all states asking for help and to a large extent, problems of Delhi are also eased out. The top court asked about a timeline to increase the number of tankers to facilitate transportation. "Give Delhi the additional 200 metric ton of oxygen they need. And also ensure it reaches Delhi," the Supreme Court asked SG Mehta.The Supreme Court said Delhi represents people from the entire country and the Centre has a peculiar role. "Forget that somebody wasn't able to lift the oxygen but you have to push through because you have to protect lives. You have a special responsibility," it added.The Supreme Court also asked what has been done to provide treatment to healthcare professionals who are contacting coronavirus disease (Covid-19). The top court on April 22 took suo motu cognizance of the "alarming situation" in connection with various health emergencies including oxygen shortage, during the pandemic and issued notice to the Centre seeking a response on kinds of immediate and effective action it can take to handle such situation. During the previous hearing, the court asked the Centre to present and apprise it as to whether a national plan can be prepared to handle this worrisome situation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-treat-action-by-states-against-people-s-appeals-on-social-media-as-contempt-of-court-sc-at-covid-19-hearing-101619767976766.html

30-04-2021||India||Delhi’s fake remdesivir injection racket: Two more arrested in Uttarakhand||Two more persons have been arrested in connection with the fake remdesivir injection scam. The racket, whose mastermind is a BPharma degree holder, had its roots in Delhi and was spread to three more states, the police said on Friday. A day ago, the police busted an industrial manufacturing unit in Uttarakhand’s Kotdwar where fake remdesivir injections were being manufactured, and arrested five people. Seven people have already been arrested from Delhi and Ghaziabad in connection with the racket, taking the total number of arrests to 14.The police said they had also unearthed a packaging unit at Haridwar, also in Uttarakhand, where the fake injections were packed and supplied to Delhi, Punjab and Haryana. Two persons were arrested following this raid, senior police officers said.“The racketeers were selling a fake remdesivir injection for anything between ₹25,000 and ₹40,000. They have already sold around 2,000 such injections in Delhi and other states,” said one of the officers, requesting anonymity.The police have not shared the names of the seven arrested persons or if the mastermind is among them.According to the officer cited above, the arrests came following the seizure of 93 remdesivir injections from seven men who were arrested from Delhi and Ghaziabad following three separate raids between April 21 and 26. Some of the seized injections appeared to be fake as the information on their packing boxes was riddled with mistakes. One of the men arrested then revealed that the supply of remdesivir injections for black marketing was being done from Punjab and Haryana. His interrogation led to the arrest of six more persons who, in turn, led the police to the manufacturing unit in Kotdwar.Late Thursday night, Delhi Police commissioner SN Shrivastava tweeted, “Delhi Police working on useful information arrested 5 culprits in a prolonged investigation & unearthed a ‘pharmaceutical’ unit at Kothdwar, Uttarakhand manufacturing large quantities of fake Remdevisir injections (COVIPRI) sold at price over Rs. 25000/-.” He said that apart from 196 fake injections, the police also seized packing machines and 3,000 empty vials in which the fake medicines were intended to be packed.

Japanese ambassador Satoshi Suzuki said in a tweet: “Japan stands with India in her greatest time of need.” A statement from Japan’s foreign ministry said the emergency assistance was being sent to India in response to the current surge in infections. “Today, April 30, upon the request of the Government of India, the Government of Japan has decided to proceed with the procedure to provide 300 oxygen concentrators and 300 ventilators to India in response to the current surge of Covid-19 infections in India,” the statement said. “Japan stands with India, our friend and partner, in her efforts to fight against Covid-19 pandemic through this additional emergency assistance. Japan will continue to extend further support promptly in order to contain the Covid-19 situation,” it said.

The announcement about the aid came days after Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Japanese counterpart Yoshihide Suga discussed cooperation in key areas, including creating resilient supply chains and ensuring reliable supply of critical materials, to overcome challenges posed by the Covid-19 pandemic. During the conversation on Monday, the two leaders also discussed the Covid-19 situation in each other’s country and close India-Japan cooperation to overcome regional and global challenges due to the pandemic. Modi had thanked Suga for providing aid to India to combat the pandemic, and expressed the hope he would be able to receive the Japanese prime minister in India in the near future after the situation stabilises. Suga recently called off a planned visit to India and the Philippines because of the Covid-19 situation. In January, Japan provided a loan of up to 30 billion yen (about ₹2,129 crore) to support the Indian government’s efforts to mitigate the socio-economic impacts of the pandemic. This was the latest addition to Japan’s support to India in its fight against Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/japan-to-send-oxygen-concentrators-ventilators-for-india-s-covid-19-response-101619758247166.html

The materials were ferried in a C-5M Super Galaxy, one of the largest strategic airlift aircraft, and at least two more emergency flights are expected by May 3 in line with US President Joe Biden’s pledge to help India counter a devastating second wave of Coronavirus infections. The US embassy tweeted: “The first of several emergency Covid-19 relief shipments from the United States has arrived in India! Building on over 70 years of cooperation, the United States stands with India as we fight the Covid-19 pandemic together. #USIndiaDosti” The supplies in the first emergency relief shipment, sent from Travis Air Force Base, included more than 400 oxygen cylinders and regulators donated by the state of California, 960,000 rapid diagnostic tests and 100,000 N95 masks provided by USAID. “A strategic partnership of global significance! Our healthcare partnership can help effectively tackle the global pandemic. Deeply appreciate gift of 423 oxygen cylinders with regulators and other medical supplies from the U.S.A.,” external affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi tweeted. Also Read | US tells citizens in India: Flights available, medical care limitedThe US military’s transportation command played a key role in arranging the flight. Earlier, the US department of defense had tweeted: “Help is on the way. Lifesaving oxygen equipment from @USAID is bound for India to combat #COVID19 and loaded for delivery at @Travis60AMW.” The second emergency relief shipment, being sent in a C-17 Globemaster aircraft, too is expected on Friday. It will include oxygen-related equipment, diagnostic kits, masks and pulse oximeters. The initial emergency assistance from the US will include 1,100 oxygen cylinders, 1,700 concentrators to obtain oxygen from ambient air, multiple large-scale oxygen generation units to support up to 20 patients each and additional mobile units to target specific shortages. A team of US experts will support oxygen generation units by working on the ground alongside Indian personnel. The support will also include raw materials for the Covishield vaccine that the US has re-directed from its own order of manufacturing supplies. These materials will allow India to make more than 20 million doses of Covid-19 vaccine, the White House said. Biden had pledged the support of the US during a phone conversation with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday. The US relief supplies began flowing in shortly after support packages from Russia and member states of the European Union (EU), part of a global effort to help India cope with record-breaking infections that have surged past the 300,000-mark over the past several days. The support will also help address a severe shortage of oxygen, which has been blamed for many deaths in recent days.Foreign secretary Harsh Shringla said on Thursday that support is expected from more than 40 countries, mostly oxygen-related equipment and critical medicines, to strengthen India’s response to an “unprecedented second wave” of infections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/first-us-emergency-relief-shipment-for-india-s-covid-19-response-arrives-101619756206873.html

Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Punjab, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana Rajasthan, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu have also said they do not have adequate vaccine doses so it will not be able to initiate the vaccination drive from Saturday, May 1.Also read | Maharashtra CM says be ready, third Covid-19 wave may hit by July-AugThe Maharashtra government has decided to not roll out the vaccination drive for the third phase for the 18-44 age group, unless they have 2.5 million doses in hand. The government is also likely to open vaccination for the 18-44 age group in a staggered manner, allowing vaccination of the 26-44 age group first. The state has also started talks with other manufacturers, Johnson and Johnson and Zydus Cadilla, for import of vaccines amid the meagre supply of Covishield and Covaxin from two domestic manufacturers.Also watch | Covaxin’s price reduced; Mumbai stops vaccination for 3 daysMadhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan said on Thursday that vaccination for people in the age group of 18-44 in the state will not start from May 1 as they don't have enough supply of the vaccine doses in time. "On contacting the manufacturers of Covishield and Covaxin vaccines, we learnt that they are unable to give us doses for those above 18 years of age on May 1. So the drive covering the young people won't start on May 1," Chouhan said in a video message on Thursday night. "Hopefully we will be getting vaccine doses around May 3. After that we will give the final shape to the drive for the young people. Keep patience and there is no need to panic," the chief minister added.Also read | India like Covid-19 crisis could 'happen anywhere': WHO tells European nationsThe Punjab health department said it will not be possible to start the third phase of the campaign to vaccinate all above 18 years of age from May 1 as was announced by the central government because of shortage of doses. The Punjab government is likely to get the schedule for the delivery of the anti-coronavirus disease shots ordered by Friday. “No assurance has been given by the two vaccine manufactures about the delivery. But in a meeting through video conferencing, the Centre on Thursday assured the states that the manufactures will convey about the supply of doses tomorrow,” principal secretary (health and family welfare) Hussan Lal said. Lal said the date of starting the vaccination drive will depend on the schedule and the consequent delivery of doses.Gujarat chief minister Vijay Rupani on Thursday said the Covid-19 vaccination drive for the 18-45 age group in the state will start latest by May 15 instead of the first day of the month. The state government said that the process to vaccinate people of this age group will begin once it gets substantial number of doses from pharmaceutical companies, which are yet to deliver them.

We require around four crore doses," Rao told PTI.According to a senior official in the Andhra Pradesh government, inoculation may not start on May 1 in the state as planned due to the delay in the procurement of vaccine from manufacturers. The state government has already written to the manufacturers for vaccine supplies and yet to get confirmation from them, the official added. A release from Andhra Pradesh chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy's office said as per the availability of stocks, the complete vaccination process for this age group in the country will not be completed until January next year.The next phase of vaccination for those above 18 years of age will not begin in Bihar from May 1, a top health official said, citing inability of Serum Institute of India (SII) in supplying the vaccines in bulk. Manoj Kumar, executive director of Bihar State Health Society, said on Thursday SII refused to supply one crore vials of the vaccine demanded by the Bihar government. Instead, SII wanted the state government to place its monthly requirement.In Jharkhand too, officials said that the inoculation drive covering people aged between 18-44 years was likely to begin in state after May 15 when the vaccines arrive. State health minister Banna Gupta claimed that the two vaccine manufacturing companies in the country expressed inability to provide vaccines before May 15, as the Centre already placed an advance booking of 120 million doses with them. “The (vaccine manufacturing) companies said they will have to deliver the Centre’s order by May 15. They said there was no chance of providing vaccines to Jharkhand before May 15, and that they will consider our order in the last week of May,” Gupta said.The immunisation drive was opened to all adults by the Centre last week and states and private hospitals were allowed to procure the vaccines doses directly from manufacturers at prices fixed by the private companies. Experts have recommended that quickly vaccinating all adults was crucial to fighting the devastating surge of infections in the second and deadly wave of the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/states-wary-of-covid-vaccine-shortage-to-delay-may-1-drive-101619752472803.html

30-04-2021||India||India like Covid-19 crisis could 'happen anywhere': WHO tells European nations||The World Health Organization issued a stark warning to European nations Thursday, saying that relaxing Covid measures could spark a "perfect storm" allowing cases to spiral -- as seen in India.New infections and deaths are soaring in India, which experts have said can in part be blamed on mass gatherings in the nation of 1.3 billion people.Follow latest updates on Covid-19 here The head of WHO Europe said countries should not make the mistake of relaxing restrictions too soon to avoid similar new waves of infection."When personal protective measures are being relaxed, when there are mass gatherings, when there are more contagious variants and the vaccination coverage is still low this can create a perfect storm in any country," Hans Kluge told reporters Thursday."It is very important to realise that the situation in India can happen anywhere."The so-called Indian variant -- or B.1.617 -- is sweeping the country, but the WHO has not yet confirmed whether it is more transmissible or more deadly than other strains of the virus.Experts have said large gatherings -- at sports matches or weddings, for example -- are in part to blame for the explosion in cases.Kluge said European nations must keep in mind that "individual and collective public health and social measures remain dominant factors in shaping the pandemic's course".He noted that while the number of new cases in the region fell "significantly" last week for the first time in two months, "infection rates across the region remain extremely high".He said vaccines were on the rise in the European region, with seven percent of the population now fully inoculated.The WHO said this means that more people in Europe have now received the vaccine than the number of people who have been infected with the disease.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-like-covid-19-crisis-could-happen-anywhere-who-tells-european-nations-101619750852083.html
30-04-2021||India||Explainer: What we know about Indian Covid-19 variant||India has recorded the world's sharpest spike in coronavirus infections this month, with political and financial capitals New Delhi and Mumbai running out of hospital beds, oxygen and medicines.Scientists are studying what led to an unexpected surge, and particularly whether a variant of the novel coronavirus first detected in India is to blame. The variant, named B.1.617, has been reported in some 17 countries, raising global concern. Here are the basics:WHAT IS THE INDIAN VARIANT?The B.1.617 variant contains two key mutations to the outer "spike" portion of the virus that attaches to human cells, said senior Indian virologist Shahid Jameel.The World Health Organization (WHO) said the predominant lineage of B.1.617 was first identified in India last December, although an earlier version was spotted in October 2020.Follow latest updates on Covid-19 here The WHO has described it as a "variant of interest", suggesting it may have mutations that would make the virus more transmissible, cause more severe disease or evade vaccine immunity. Other strains with known risks, such as those first detected in the United Kingdom, Brazil and South Africa, have been categorised as "variants of concern," a higher threat level.ARE VARIANTS DRIVING THE SURGE IN CASES?It's hard to say.The WHO says more study is urgently needed. Laboratory-based studies of limited sample size suggest potential increased transmissibility, it concluded.The picture is complicated because the highly transmissible B.117 variant first detected in the U.K. is behind spikes in some parts of India. In New Delhi, UK variant cases almost doubled during the second half of March, according to Sujeet Kumar Singh, director of the National Centre for Disease Control. The Indian variant, though, is widely present in Maharashtra, the country's hardest-hit state, Singh said.Prominent US disease modeller Chris Murray, from the University of Washington, said the sheer magnitude of infections in India in a short period of time suggests an "escape variant" may be overpowering any prior immunity from natural infections in those populations."That makes it most likely that it’s B.1.617," he said. But Murray cautioned that gene sequencing data on the coronavirus in India is sparse, and that many cases are also being driven by the UK and South African variants.Carlo Federico Perno, Head of Microbiology and Immunology Diagnostics at Rome's Bambino Gesù Hospital, said the Indian variant couldn't alone be the reason for India's huge surge, pointing instead to large social gatherings.Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been criticised for allowing massive political rallies and religious festivals which have been super-spreader events in recent weeks.DO VACCINES STOP IT?One bright spot is that vaccines may be protective. White House chief medical adviser Anthony Fauci said earlier this week that preliminary evidence from lab studies suggest Covaxin, a vaccine developed in India, appears capable of neutralizing the variant.Public Health England said it was working with international partners but that there is currently no evidence that the Indian variant and two related variants cause more severe disease or render the vaccines currently deployed less effective.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/explainer-what-we-know-about-indian-covid-19-variant-101619749560610.html

30-04-2021||India||‘Not woke’ on same-sex relationships: HC judge to talk to psychologist||A Madras high court judge on Wednesday fixed an appointment with a psychologist to understand same-sex orientation better before recording his judgment in a case pertaining to a lesbian couple who sought protection from their birth families that are opposed to their relationship, and directed the police to close the first information report filed on the basis of a missing person’s complaint filed by the parents of both women.Justice N Anand Venkatesh said that he would want to undergo an educational session with Vidhya Dinakaran, a city-based psychologist, while hearing the petition.“Ultimately in this case, the words must come from my heart and not from my head, and the same will not be possible if I am not fully “woke” on this aspect,” justice Venkatesh said. “For this purpose, I want to subject myself for psycho-education with Vidhya Dinakaran, and I would request the psychologist to fix a convenient appointment for the same. I honestly feel that such a session with a professional will help me understand same-sex relationships better and will pave way for my evolution. If I write an order after undergoing psycho-education, I trust that the words will fall from my heart.”In a previous hearing, the court directed the petitioners as well as their parents to undergo counselling, and Dinakaran submitted a report to the judge on Wednesday.The court noted that the psychologist’s opinion is that the petitioners “perfectly understand the relationship they have entered” and that there was “no confusion in their minds”. It was also observed that they have a lot of love and affection for their parents and that their only fear is that they may be coerced into separation.“According to the psychologist, such a scenario will cause a lot of mental trauma to the petitioners,” the judge observed. “The petitioners are also willing to wait for their parents, whom they fervently hope will understand the relationship at some future point of time,” he said.Meanwhile, the parents of both the petitioners, the court observed, were worried of stigma, consequences in the society and the security of their daughters.A total of four petitions on same-sex marriage are pending before the high courts of Delhi and Kerala, challenging various acts that restrict marriage to opposite sex or heterosexual couples. Though the Supreme Court read down Section 377, which criminalised same-sex adult consensual relationships, in 2018, several same-sex couples continue to seek protection from the court as their birth families continue to oppose their sexuality.“One more interesting observation that has been made in [Dinakaran’s] report is that the parents would rather prefer their daughters to live a life of celibacy, which according to them will be more dignified than having a partner of the same sex,” justice Venkatesh observed on Wednesday. The parents are confused over lineage and adoption that would apply in a same-sex relationship.The petitioners are two women from Madurai who are currently taking refuge in Chennai.The matter has been posted for June 7.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/not-woke-on-same-sex-relationships-hc-judge-to-talk-to-psychologist-101619737028168.html
30-04-2021||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||On Wednesday, 43% of the world’s new coronavirus disease cases came from India. Rising positivity rates — weekly average positivity rates are up in 31 of the 34 states and Union territories (UTs) that publish testing data regularly — indicate that, one, the surge in India’s numbers will continue (although states and UTs can always change their approach to testing to hide the real numbers, or, worse still, show a dip in positivity rates; this is beginning to happen) and two, that many states and UTs are definitely not testing enough.This is really the only positivity bit that should worry everyone, not any other. Indeed, people who are suddenly discovering and making impassioned pleas about the spiritual and psychological reasons not to post or publish photographs and videos of cremations and burials must understand and acknowledge that they are merely being (wittingly or unwittingly, and most certainly witlessly) apologists for governments that seem more worried about the narrative than the underlying facts. Every time someone has told me to be positive over the past few days (and there are some who are persistent), there’s a voice I hear in my head — it’s Neil Young, singing, “Don’t let it bring you down/ it’s only castles burning.”But back to the country’s numbers. According to the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center, India is currently one of the two countries (Colombia is the other one) among the 10 worst affected countries (by daily cases) where things are getting worse. And Colombia, to put things in perspective, is adding around 17,000 cases a day on average. On Wednesday, India added 379,423 new cases, for a weekly average of 349,029 cases. The country recorded 3,643 deaths on Wednesday for a weekly average of 2,877. On Wednesday, the number of active cases in the country surged to 3.08 million.According to comments last week by All India Institute of Medical Sciences director Randeep Guleria, 10-15% of those infected may need hospitalisation, and less than 5% may require critical care.These numbers are significantly higher than the ones I’ve seen for other countries, but they can still safely be considered upper bounds.Even at 10%, that translates into a maximum of 300,000 people requiring hospitalisation, with 150,000 of them requiring critical care.But there are other factors at play.One is the absence of triage (simply, prioritising hospitalisation on the basis of the seriousness of the illness), something that is critical when demand exceeds supply.Delhi, for instance, ended Wednesday with almost 100,000 active cases, which means it needs around 10,000 hospital beds, including 5,000 critical care ones. The city-state has around 20,000 beds, of which almost 19,000 are occupied according to the government’s dashboard. In addition, it has around 4,600 critical care ones, all of which are also occupied. Delhi’s excessive hospitalisation numbers may be on account of people from other states, notably Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, traditionally heading to the Capital for treatment, but, equally, with hospital beds becoming scarce, many Delhi residents have headed to Noida, even Ambala, over the past week, so there’s some natural balancing of numbers. This clearly points to the absence of triage (and also its importance). The second wave of the coronavirus disease has set off panic in some parts of the country (and Delhi is definitely one). Not everyone seeking it needs hospitalisation, just as not everyone looking for remdesivir injections needs them (in fact, most do not). Triage can address the first (but it needs to be done efficiently). Better medical advice can address the second. I am not mentioning the rush for plasma therapy because it doesn’t work.The second factor is concentration of cases. Bengaluru, for instance, ended Wednesday with 224,152 active cases, the highest for any Indian city (and 7.3% of all active cases in the country). That means it needs around 22,000 beds, including 11,000 critical care ones. The city has nowhere that many. So, while triage may be able to lessen the pressure in the case of Bengaluru, the city still needs to urgently enhance hospital and ICU capacity.Then, that can be said for almost any city in India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-what-you-need-to-know-today-101619736711854.html
30-04-2021||India||IIT Delhi relaxes norms after 22% students say they tested Covid-19 positive||Officials at the Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi (IIT-D) announced several relaxations, including of deadlines and attendance norms, after 22% respondents of an internal online survey said they tested positive for the coronavirus disease between March and April.More than a tenth of students surveyed said they were considering withdrawing from the ongoing semester due to the stress caused by the pandemic and associated personal grievances, while over 40% said they wanted the semester halted for a while.Of the 3,910 students who participated the survey, which was conducted between Sunday and Tuesday, 857 said they contracted the infection since March, while 61% said a family member, or someone close to them, tested positive in the same period.HT has seen a copy of the survey report.The respondents included students enrolled in undergraduate, postgraduate and research programmes, as well as those pursuing diplomas and dual degree courses at the institute.The institute currently has over 10,000 students enrolled across courses.After the survey’s results were analysed, the college administration decided on several relaxations for students for the ongoing semester, including exempting attendance from its evaluation policy, and extending deadlines for assignments. The decision was approved by the IIT-D’s senate, the institute’s highest decision-making body, during a meeting on Wednesday.To be sure, not all the students tested positive for Covid-19 on campus. Most students who took the survey were at home. The campus has been closed for physical classes since March.Students were allowed to resume research and laboratory work with Covid-19 guidelines as laid down by a University Grants Commission (UGC) directive last November. Earlier this month, the administration advised all students who had returned to the campus to leave after a sharp rise in Delhi’s Covid trajectory.On April 18, the IIT-D administration said at least 30 students on campus tested positive in the previous 30 days.The survey revealed that 11% of the students were considering withdrawing from the ongoing semester. About 43%, or 1,688 students, said they wanted the current semester to be put on hold for a few weeks. Though the administration did not halt the semester, it has decided to extend deadlines for any student adversely affected by the pandemic. Students ill for more than four weeks will also be considered for these relaxations, officials said.Shantanu Roy, the institute’s dean of academics, said, “The senate did not think halting the semester was a solution, since we are towards its very end. It decided to give relaxation to students directly or indirectly affected by the pandemic. They can take the exams whenever it will be possible for them.”Several students continued to demand that the semester be halted by a few weeks for everyone. “It looks like the administration doesn’t trust students even after conducting a survey. They think all the stories of students suffering are cooked up,” said an undergraduate student, who wished not to be named.The institute also decided to give students a week off, from May 1-7, before the online exams begin on May 9.“Normally in the regular time, we ask for documents like medical reports and test reports in case students decide to not take an exam due to a medical reason. However, during the current situation, IIT-D has decided not to ask for any such document immediately. They can also decide to take exams later, whenever it is possible for them,” Roy added.The senate also recommended a six-month extension for PhD scholars to finish their research.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/iit-delhi-relaxes-norms-after-22-students-say-they-tested-covid-19-positive-101619735356349.html

We have shared vaccines with more than 80 countries and provided life-saving drugs, medicines and protective equipment to over 150 countries. Our efforts underscore that we will not defeat the pandemic unless all of us, everywhere, come out of it safely,” Amarnath said.Under India’s “Vaccine Maitri” initiative, which translates into Vaccine Friendship, the country has been providing vaccines to nations across the world — from immediate neighbours to countries in Latin America and Africa.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tried-to-walk-the-talk-on-vaccine-equity-despite-constraints-says-india-at-un-101619733218125.html
30-04-2021||India||Oxygen key focus of support to India: EU envoy||Oxygen-related equipment is a major focus of the European Union’s efforts to support India’s Covid-19 response but vaccines need to be developed speedily and in sufficient quantities to decisively defeat the Coronavirus, EU ambassador Ugo Astuto said on Thursday.Since the EU began coordinating efforts by member states to provide urgently needed materials and supplies on Sunday, France and Germany have announced major deliveries of oxygen, and equipment is arriving from Ireland (700 oxygen concentrators and an oxygen generator), Romania (80 oxygen concentrators and 75 cylinders), Luxembourg (58 ventilators), Portugal and Sweden.“Oxygen is a major focus of our support, as requested by Indian authorities,” Astuto said in an interview, describing immediate and long-terms steps envisaged by the EU to help India cope with the massive surge in infections and to prepare for future pandemics.“To prepare for the future, we need to draw lessons from the experience so far. It is clear that to defeat the virus decisively, we need to develop vaccines early and in sufficient quantities. We also need to strengthen the capacity of the international community to respond in a cohesive and consistent manner,” he said.His remarks came against the backdrop of daily infections crossing well past the 300,000-mark for almost a week and hospitals across the country grappling with a severe shortage of oxygen.Astuto said the pandemic had shown how interconnected the world is, and the EU and India can help shape the global agenda for finding common responses.“We have to strengthen the multilateral tools we have already at our disposal, such as the WHO, and possibly think about new tools specifically targeted to pandemics, such as for instance an international treaty on pandemics,” he said.Looking ahead to the virtual India-EU Summit to be held on May 8, Astuto said the two sides are preparing a EU-India Connectivity Partnership.“At our summit in July 2020, we agreed to promote jointly a transparent, inclusive and rules-based approach to connectivity. We agreed that connectivity projects should be environmentally, socially and fiscally sustainable, providing a level playing field for businesses,” he said.With a lot of focus on resumption of talks on a trade and investment pact, Astuto said the EU “would be ready to start exploring a standalone investment agreement, as we believe it would be in our mutual interest to establish a stable legal framework for investments, which would give a positive signal in both directions”.He said: “Executive vice president Valdis Dombrovskis and commerce minister Piyush Goyal met for talks in February and are about to meet again. They will discuss the perspective of trade and investment agreements, but also the wider economic agenda. There is significant scope for broader exchanges and cooperation on issues such as reform of WTO, security of supply chains [and] regulatory issues.”With the EU recently unveiling a strategy to reinforce its presence in the Indo-Pacific, Astuto said the 27-member bloc “regards itself as a major stakeholder in this region and wants to work with like-minded partners, such as India”.He said the Indo-Pacific is a crucial manufacturing hub, central to global value chains and at the forefront of the digital economy. “The region is also key for climate change and the environment...In many ways, the path of the future world will be set in the Indo-Pacific region,” he added.The EU will develop its partnerships with India on foreign policy and security and defence, and this will include addressing challenges to maritime security, emerging and disruptive technologies, and countering terrorism or organised crime, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/oxygen-key-focus-of-support-to-india-eu-envoy-101619732731132.html
30-04-2021||India||US rushes $100-million worth supplies for India’s Covid fight||The US is rushing supplies worth more than $100 million, including large oxygen generation systems and raw materials for making 20 million vaccine doses, to back India’s Covid-19 response in the face of a devastating second wave of Coronavirus infections.The first emergency relief shipment, expected to arrive on a US military transport aircraft from Travis Air Force Base, will include 440 oxygen cylinders and regulators donated by the state of California. The flight will also carry 960,000 rapid diagnostic tests and 100,000 N95 masks provided by USAID.The aid is in line with a pledge made by President Joe Biden during a phone conversation with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday. Two special US flights carrying equipment and supplies are expected to reach India on Friday and a third on May 3.The US relief supplies will start flowing in shortly after support packages from Russia and member states of the European Union (EU), part of a global effort to help India cope with record-breaking infections that have surged past the 300,000-mark over the past several days. The support will also help address a severe shortage of oxygen, which has been blamed for many deaths in recent days.On Thursday, Foreign secretary Harsh Shringla said that support is expected from over 40 countries, mostly oxygen-related equipment and critical medicines, to strengthen India’s response to an “unprecedented second wave” of infections.“Thanks to @US_TRANSCOM, @AirMobilityCmd, @Travis60AMW & @DLAmil for hustling to prepare critical @USAID medical supplies for shipping. As I’ve said, we’re committed to use every resource at our disposal, within our authority, to support India’s frontline healthcare workers,” US defense secretary Lloyd Austin tweeted.A statement from the White House said: “Just as India sent assistance to the United States when our hospitals were strained early in the pandemic, the United States is determined to help India in its time of need.”The emergency assistance from the US will include an initial delivery of 1,100 oxygen cylinders that will remain in India, 1,700 concentrators to obtain oxygen from ambient air, multiple large-scale oxygen generation units to support up to 20 patients each and additional mobile units to target specific shortages. A team of US experts will support oxygen generation units by working on the ground alongside Indian personnel.The support will also include raw materials for the Covishield vaccine that the US has redirected from its own order of manufacturing supplies. These materials will allow India to make over 20 million doses of Covid-19 vaccine, the White House statement said.The US is also sending 15 million N95 masks to protect patients and health care personnel, one million rapid diagnostic tests of the same type used by the White House to provide reliable results in less than 15 minutes, and the first tranche of a planned 20,000 doses of the antiviral drug remdesivir.The US also plans to send more planeloads of oxygen cylinders. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has locally procured more cylinders and will deliver them to India. CDC experts will work with Indian experts in labs, surveillance and epidemiology, bioinformatics for genomic sequencing and modelling, infection prevention and control, vaccine rollout, and risk communication, the White House said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/us-rushes-100-million-worth-supplies-for-india-s-covid-fight-101619732205708.html
30-04-2021||India||PM Modi held 21 meetings over second wave in April||At least 21 official engagements of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in April, most done over the past two weeks, were related to the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic in India and the country’s management of it, underlining the crisis facing the country which is now seeing in excess of 350,000 new cases a day on average.This is the highest number of Covid-19 related reviews and meetings in which the Prime Minister has participated since March 2020, when he announced a strict federal lockdown. That month, the PM had 14 official engagements on Covid.The list of Covid-19 engagements of the PM in April included review meetings with union government officials, conferences with state chief ministers, dialogue with foreign leaders such as the ones he had with US President Joe Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin this week, and addresses to the nation.The PM has had at least 65 official engagements between March 2020 and April 2021 exclusively on Covid, according to the records in Press Information Bureau—the government’s publicity arm. Government officials claim that in addition, the PM has been talking to experts, political leaders and other stakeholders on the crisis, but that these are not listed as official engagements.Between January and March 2021, when India’s covid curve showed a temporary slump, the PM’s engagements on Covid reduced. This also coincided with the campaigning for the elections in four states and a Union Terriory. the Prime Minister campaigned heavily for his Bharatiya Janata Party , especially in West Bengal where elections were held in eight phases (the last phase was on Thursday). In March this year, the PM had just one Covid-19 engagement—a review meeting with all chief ministers on March 17—apart from taking his first Covid vaccine shot at AIIMS, Delhi.In February too, Modi had just one engagement related to the pandemic: addressing a workshop on “Covid-19 Management: Experience, Good Practices and Way Forward” with 10 Neighbouring Countries in his official programme. The PIB archive shows that in January, Modi had two official engagements: launching India’s vaccination campaign on January 16 and interacting with beneficiaries and vaccinators in Varanasi.After peaking in September, India’s first wave of Covid-19 infections tapered off, reaching a low of 10,988 new cases on average a week on February 11, 2021. The second wave emerged in February, powered likely by variants, the relaxation of Covid guidelines, and mass political and religious gatherings. Cases have soared since. As have hospitalisations. And crucial medical commodities such as oxygen have been found to be in short supply (or at least not available when and where they are needed).In April alone, again, mostly in the past 10 days, the Prime Minister had five engagements only on oxygen—underlining the gravity of the situation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-held-21-meeting-over-second-wave-in-april-101619730220140.html
30-04-2021||India||India set to get assistance from 40 nations in Covid-19 fight: Govt||India is set to receive support from more than 40 countries, mostly oxygen-related equipment and consignments of critical medicines, to bolster the country’s response to an “unprecedented second wave” of Covid-19 infections, foreign secretary Harsh Shringla said on Thursday.Shringla made the remarks at a news briefing hours after two Russian military aircraft flew in 20 oxygen production plants, ventilators and 200,000 medicine packs, while three special flights from the US were expected to bring in raw materials for Covid-19 vaccines, oxygen generating equipment and oxygen concentrators.The external affairs ministry is working with the health ministry and other agencies to expedite clearances and to ensure the equipment and medicines speedily reach areas where they are needed the most. Indian missions around the world have lists of urgently needed items – liquid oxygen, oxygen producing units and critical medicines such as Remdesivir and Tocilizumab – so that they can coordinate with foreign governments and corporations to expedite deliveries.“We are facing an unprecedented second wave of the pandemic. As of now, we have over three million active cases. This has obviously put considerable pressure on our healthcare system, on the capacities and resources that we have,” Shringla told the briefing.More than 40 countries, including major powers such as the US, Russia, France and Germany, have committed to provide much needed items and Indian and foreign corporations are helping with procurements. Indian community associations in many countries too are pitching in to provide relief materials.Shringla said India expects to receive more than 500 oxygen generating plants, more than 4,000 oxygen concentrators, more than 10,000 oxygen cylinders, and 17 cryogenic oxygen tankers. Biopharmaceutical major Gilead Sciences has offered 450,000 doses of the antiviral medication Remdesivir while India expects to get some 300,000 doses of Favipiravir from Russia and the United Arab Emirates, and consignments of Tocilizumab from Germany and Switzerland.Gilead and Roche Pharmaceuticals are helping expedite the supply of raw materials so that domestic production can be ramped up. Indian firms currently produce 67,000 doses of Remdesivir a day, whereas the requirement is 200,000 to 300,000 doses a day. Shringla said these firms expect to boost production to up to 400,000 doses once raw materials are brought in.Shringla was more circumspect on the issue of whether the support from other countries amounted to a shift from India’s policy decision after the 2004 tsunami on not accepting foreign aid.“I don’t think we are looking at it in policy terms, we are looking at it in terms of the situation that is very, very unusual, unprecedented and exceptional and we will do whatever it takes to meet the requirements of our people at this point of time,” he said in response to a question on whether there had been a policy shift.“The current situation is something we have never seen before and may never see again...We have certainly prioritised items that we need, we are sourcing many of these items from many countries, but many countries have come forward on their own to offer assistance,” he added.Many countries are responding to the situation in India because New Delhi played a proactive role in providing essential pharmaceutical products and even vaccines in the earlier phases of the pandemic, Shringla said, adding that US President Joe Biden and others had said they would assist India because it had provided help over the past year.India is open to acquiring vaccines from other countries for its immunisation programme till Indian manufacturers ramp up production. Vaccines should be seen in the context of an inter-dependent world with supply chains of raw materials and finished products, Shringla said.The country’s vaccine programme is based on international cooperation, including with the WHO-backed COVAX facility and Indian firms too have international connections for research and development.“Today, our needs are far greater, and all our partners understand that what we require is a ramping up of our vaccination programme. We have to go up significantly,” he said, adding all the existing capacity will be needed once the vaccination drive becomes universal for everyone above 18 years from May 1. “In that context, if we can source vaccines we will do it, whether it’s from the US, Russia or other countries,” he said.Officer on special duty Dammu Ravi, who played a crucial role in guiding India’s response in the initial stages of the pandemic last year, is again dealing with all Covid-19-related issues along with a group of young officers who are working 24x7.On the issue of accepting support from China, Shringla said: “We know that a number of companies in India are sourcing priority requirements, be they oxygen generators and concentrators, and some of it is being sourced from China. Cargo flights are operating...but I think this is part of meeting requirements in the most effective manner possible.”People familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that all international assistance would be exempted from taxes if it was approved by the government and routed to the Indian Red Cross Society. This includes government-to-government assistance and materials donated by corporate and individuals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-set-to-get-assistance-from-40-nations-in-covid-19-fight-govt-101619729826434.html
30-04-2021||India||Bharat Biotech lowers vaccine price for states||Bharat Biotech, the co-developer and manufacturer of India’s indigenous coronavirus disease vaccine, Covaxin, on Thursday announced a revised selling price of ₹400 per dose, from the earlier ₹600, for state governments.The vaccine manufacturer’s decision to slash the price by 33% came a a day after another Covid-19 vaccine manufacturer, Serum Institute of India (SII), which makes the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine under the brand name Covishield in India, reduced its selling price to states to ₹300 from ₹400.“Bharat Biotech is deeply concerned with the critical pandemic circumstances that India is facing at this time. Recognising the enormous challenges to the public health care system, we have made Covaxin available to state governments at a price of ₹400 per dose,” the company said in a statement.“We wish to be transparent in our approach to pricing which was determined by internally funded product development, several operationally intensive BSL-3 manufacturing facilities (the first of its kind in our country) and clinical trials. We wish to champion innovation in India and our commitment to public health is absolute,” the statement added.For private hospitals and institutions, the company has set the cost at ₹1,200 per dose, and for international market, the vaccine will be sold for $15-20 per dose, it announced earlier.The decisions by the two companies come amid demands from several states that the vaccine prices for them be reduced, and be brought at par with the price for the Union government, which buys the two vaccines from SII and Bharat Biotech for ₹150 a dose.Several chief ministers, including Delhi’s Arvind Kejriwal and Maharashtra’s Uddhav Thackeray, have demanded a “one nation, one price” policy.But the companies have stressed that the revenue generated from sale is important for them to expand production capacities.Bharat Biotech has a production capacity of about 10 million Covaxin doses each month, and is looking at manufacturing scale up in a stepwise manner across multiple facilities at Hyderabad and Bangalore.With the help of the Union government, the company is working towards ramping up the production capacity by at least 100% by May-June, 2021, and with a target set of producing nearly 100 million doses per month by September 2021. The Union finance ministry also approved a credit line of ₹1,500 crore to Bharat Biotech for this purpose.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bharat-biotech-lowers-vaccine-price-for-states-101619729598566.html
30-04-2021||India||IIT-B alumni seek action against Kharagpur prof for remarks on SC, ST students||A group of alumna members of Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay (IIT-B) on Thursday have urged the director of IIT-Kharagpur (IIT-KGP) to take action against a professor who was allegedly seen verbally abusing a preparatory class for students belonging to the scheduled castes (SC) and scheduled tribes (ST) categories and those with physical disabilities in a video.In a letter to IIT-KGP’s director Virendra Kumar Tewari, alumni said the video, that had emerged four days ago, has “horrified” them. They demanded that Tewari take immediate action against the violation of classroom ethics, create a safe space for students to place their grievances and attend to them on an urgent basis with immediate action. Despite repeated attempts, Tewari remained unavailable for a comment.Videos of Seema Singh, an associate professor from IIT-KGP’s humanities and social sciences department emerged on social media on Sunday where she can be heard repeatedly hurling abuses at students reportedly attending online preparatory classes meant for students from SC, ST categories and those with physical disabilities. The recordings, which are under the institute’s review, were posted anonymously on IIT-KGP’s confessions page, an informal group of students on social media.The 25 IIT-B alumna include Anupama Krishnamurthy (class of 1988), researcher at French Institute Pondicherry; Shaibani Azam (class of 1986), professor at Jamia Millia University; Enakshi Bhattacharya (class of 1980), professor at IIT-Madras; Deepti Pradhan (class of 1986); associate director of research at Yale University and Chayanika Shah (class of 1986), retired lecturer, KJ Somaiya College of Science and Commerce.“We were students at a time when the gender ratio in IIT-B was less than 5%. As minority students on campus, we have experienced many sexist comments from teachers and recognise today how their actions and statements made an adverse impact on our learning environment. We, hence, speak from some personal experience of discrimination at IIT-campuses. We were even then aware of the ways in which those who came from marginalised caste backgrounds, were not English speaking, or were from smaller towns were discriminated against,” wrote the group.The women had also participated in a strike in 1980 when four students had raised their voice against IIT-B’s order cancelling their admissions on the grounds that they had a backlog in courses and were not able to cope with the undergraduate programme. The unprecedented strike had forced the institute to a grinding halt for almost 40 days.“Some of us are now a part of the academia, while a few of us have seen how discrimination at institutes works. We are also seeing a surge in the number of cases of discrimination coming out. This reminds us of our experience as a minority on campus. Since 1980, we have been reiterating that it not enough for institutes to just bring in students from diverse backgrounds. There’s a need to make them feel safe and supported,” said Shah.Institutions are not fit to look after diverse students in their present state, Shah added.“While a complete overhaul of the education system is ideal, there are things institutes can do immediately. They must set up anti-discrimination cells, train teachers on how to treat diversity and reduce the emphasis on [academic] performance,” she said.Meanwhile, the videos, which are viral on social media, have sparked an outrage across campuses. While Singh has apologised to students for her behaviour in an email, many student and alumni bodies across campuses have started online petitions demanding action against her and the creation of an SC/ ST cell at IITs.The Science Education Group (SEG), a students’ forum at IIT-KGP, issued a statement on Wednesday: “There have also been previous unverified reports that state her [Seema’s] brazen and abusive behaviour with students. She has an alleged history of doing these things. One thing that can be concluded from all this is that primarily this is systematic power abuse, which often goes under the carpet and secondarily, underlines the casteist behaviour of the system…”Meanwhile on Tuesday, the National Commission for Scheduled Castes issued letters to the institute, Union education ministry, West Bengal’s government and director general of police, informing them that the commission will investigate the matter.“The commission has taken a suo-motu cognisance of the use of unparliamentary language and casteist remarks made by professor Seema Singh while taking a class of SC/ ST students… Her remarks have hurt the sentiments of many Indians, specifically the SC community,” the commission wrote.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/iitb-alumni-seek-action-against-kharagpur-prof-for-remarks-on-sc-st-students-101619728845442.html
30-04-2021||India||Facebook blocks hashtag against PM Modi by ‘mistake’, later restores it||Facebook, late on Wednesday, blocked a hashtag “#ResignModi” for several hours before restoring it, claiming this was done by mistake, even as the Union government issued a statement saying it had not asked for anything to be blocked by Facebook.“We temporarily blocked this hashtag by mistake, not because the Indian government asked us to, and have since restored it,” a Facebook spokesperson said.The ministry of electronics and information technology echoed Facebook, and cited a Wall Street Journal story attributing the removal of a “certain hashtag” to the government of India’s efforts to curb public dissent. It called the story “misleading on facts and mischievous in intent”. In a series of posts on the microblogging site Koo, the ministry said the government has not issued any direction to remove this hashtag. “Facebook has also clarified that it was removed by mistake,” it said. The statement went on to make claims about another story in WSJ published earlier in March.India is in the grip of a surging second wave of Covid-19 infections, which have crossed the 350,000 daily cases mark over the past few days. The death toll has crossed 200,000, and both the Centre and the state governments have been criticised for their mismanagement of a situation that seemed in control even a month ago.The blocking and unblocking of the hashtag came days after the Centre issued orders to take down at least 100 “inflammatory” posts and accounts across Twitter, Facebook and Instagram related to Covid-19, including a verified Facebook page of West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee.The emergency blocking orders, under Section 69(A) of the Information Technology Act, were issued by the ministry of electronics and information technology on Friday, and came into force on Saturday. Rights activists have accused the government of stifling critical content, while the government argued that the decision was taken to counter Covid related misinformation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/facebook-blocks-hashtag-against-pm-modi-by-mistake-later-restores-it-101619728664461.html
30-04-2021||India||Supreme Court rejects plea for CBI probe into Pul’s death||The Supreme Court on Thursday refused to entertain a petition seeking probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) into the unnatural death of Arunachal Pradesh’s former chief minister Kalikho Pul in August 2016.A bench, headed by Justice Uday U Lalit, held PIL to be not maintainable since it was filed by an organisation, ‘Social Vigilance Team’, that had nothing to do with the case.“We cannot let a stranger to intervene in a criminal matter in the given facts. You (organisation) are not even aware of what has been happening with the probe by the police. You claim that the investigation by the police is not proper but you are not in a position to tell us how and why,” observed the bench.Senior counsel Siddharth Dave, representing the petitioner, sought to persuade the bench that the court had in some other cases did order a CBI probe in the larger public interest at the instance of a third party.But the bench replied: “These are not the facts in which we can do that. You are a complete stranger. You have not claimed or shown any connection with the family or the case at all.”Dave then withdrew the petition with a liberty to approach any other appropriate forum.In July 2016, the SC quashed imposition of President’s rule in Arunachal Pradesh, restoring the Congress government and ouster of Pul who became the CM in February that year, with the support of Bharatiya Janata Party legislators after leaving the Congress.On August 9, Pul’s body was found in his official bungalow with a purported suicide note, alleging that extraneous considerations influenced the SC’s verdict that led to his ouster as CM.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-rejects-plea-for-cbi-probe-into-pul-s-death-101619728431478.html
30-04-2021||India||Disquiet in BJP over UP local polls’ campaign amid Covid-19||Disquiet is brewing in a section of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Uttar Pradesh over the party’s campaigning in the ongoing state panchayat elections despite surging coronavirus infections, deaths and an overwhelmed healthcare system, HT has learnt. Senior BJP state leaders say the party, already under fire for the health crisis, is facing additional criticism for violating Covid protocol during its campaigning in UP.They also point out that the party is facing similar public anger for huge mask-less rallies in Telangana for local body polls.Two days ago, the state government faced sharp criticism on the issue from the Allahabad high court, which noted that 135 poll officials had died on duty and blamed the state election commission and administration for not enforcing Covid norms.The UP government defended itself, saying the four-phase panchayat polls, which began on April 19 and ended on Thursday, was necessitated by a ruling of the Allahabad high court. “It was in the compliance of the high court’s order that the UP government had to go through panchayat polls despite Covid scare,” the government said.But senior BJP leaders said the issue could have been taken up with the court and the election commission, given the scale of infections. A state-level functionary, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the court ordered the election, but a way could have been found.“It is not possible to avoid crowds... The guidelines cannot be followed strictly and consequently unlike in 2020, when the rural areas were largely insulated, this time the virus has reached villages,” the functionary said. A second party functionary said this election was happening at a time there was growing unrest among the people over inadequate healthcare facilities. “Elected representatives have not been able to secure oxygen or hospital beds. There is a lot of anger, and justifiably so. The government is doing the best it can, but this time the spread is not limited to a few districts, so the facilities are not enough.”Uttar Pradesh is one of the worst affected districts in the second wave. The state has posted a seven-day average of 34,455 cases daily, and its case count and death tally stand at 1,217,952 and 12,238, respectively.Two party legislators Ramesh Diwaker and Suresh Srivastava and Geeta Sagar, a panchayat candidate, have succumbed to Covid-19. “In each district, the party has lost several office-bearers... It’s very demoralising,” the second functionary said.Many party office-bearers have been discreet in voicing their concerns, but state lawmaker Prakash Dwivedi wrote to chief minister Yogi Adityanath demanding two phases of the polls on April 26 and 29 be deferred. Later, state minister Sunil Bharala and BJP MP Kaushal Kishore complained about facilities at government hospitals in Meerut and Lucknow.A third party functionary said the state’s decision to file cases against those found to be spreading rumours was well intended but caused consternation.Similar concerns about election rallies violating Covid protocol have also been voiced in Telangana, where elections to seven municipalities are scheduled for Friday.A former chief election commissioner, requesting anonymity, said elections couldn’t be deferred at will. “There is a constitutional provision to hold elections on time. What the state election commission could have done is to seek an amendment to the rules in Parliament.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/disquiet-in-bjp-over-up-local-polls-campaign-amid-covid19-101619728242854.html
30-04-2021||India||Don’t have vaccines to start jabs from May 1, says MP’s Shivraj Singh Chouhan||Madhya Pradesh will not be able to start the vaccination of people in the 18-44 age group from May 1 due to non-availability of vaccines by the manufacturers, chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan announced on Thursday, joining a growing list of states that have pointed to supply bottlenecks to deliver on the Centre’s announcement.Chouhan said Madhya Pradesh is expected to receive the first round of vaccine supplies on May 3 and will start the vaccination drive accordingly.Madhya Pradesh is the first major BJP-ruled state to announce its inability to launch the vaccination drive from May 1.The Centre last week opened the immunisation drive to all adults and allowed states and private hospitals to procure directly from vaccine manufacturers at prices fixed by the private companies. The move came against the backdrop of recommendations from experts that quickly vaccinating all adults was crucial to fighting the devastating surge of infections.But the two vaccine manufacturers, Serum Institute of India and the Bharat Biotech, have indicate to several states that they would have to go slow. On Thursday, Chhattisgarh chief minister Bhupesh Baghel told PM Narendra Modi in a letter that the supply schedule for 25 lakh vaccines by Bharat Biotech implied that it could take his government a year to inoculate the entire state. Serum Institute, he said in the letter, hadn’t even responded to their request.The city government in national capital Delhi has also made it clear that they may not be able to start the third phase of Covid-19 vaccination from Saturday because the city hasn’t received its first order of jabs and private hospitals may get consignments weeks later.“We don’t have enough vaccines. We have requested for procurement of vaccines from the respective companies. Despite all preparations being made, availability of vaccines is a must for the inoculation to begin,” said Delhi health minister Satyender Jain.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dont-have-vaccines-to-start-jabs-from-may-1-says-mp-s-shivraj-singh-chouhan-101619728184869.html
30-04-2021||India||O2 key focus of support to India: EU envoy||New Delhi: Oxygen-related equipment is a major focus of the European Union’s efforts to support India’s Covid-19 response but vaccines need to be developed speedily and in sufficient quantities to decisively defeat the Coronavirus, EU ambassador Ugo Astuto said on Thursday. Since the EU began coordinating efforts by member states to provide urgently needed materials and supplies on Sunday, France and Germany have announced major deliveries of oxygen, and equipment is arriving from Ireland (700 oxygen concentrators and an oxygen generator), Romania (80 oxygen concentrators and 75 cylinders), Luxembourg (58 ventilators), Portugal and Sweden. “Oxygen is a major focus of our support, as requested by Indian authorities,” Astuto said in an interview, describing immediate and long-terms steps envisaged by the EU to help India cope with the massive surge in infections and to prepare for future pandemics. “To prepare for the future, we need to draw lessons from the experience so far. It is clear that to defeat the virus decisively, we need to develop vaccines early and in sufficient quantities. We also need to strengthen the capacity of the international community to respond in a cohesive and consistent manner,” he said. His remarks came against the backdrop of daily infections crossing well past the 300,000-mark for almost a week and hospitals across the country grappling with a severe shortage of oxygen. Astuto said the pandemic had shown how interconnected the world is, and the EU and India can help shape the global agenda for finding common responses. “We have to strengthen the multilateral tools we have already at our disposal, such as the WHO, and possibly think about new tools specifically targeted to pandemics, such as for instance an international treaty on pandemics,” he said. Looking ahead to the virtual India-EU Summit to be held on May 8, Astuto said the two sides are preparing a EU-India Connectivity Partnership. “At our summit in July 2020, we agreed to promote jointly a transparent, inclusive and rules-based approach to connectivity. We agreed that connectivity projects should be environmentally, socially and fiscally sustainable, providing a level playing field for businesses,” he said. With a lot of focus on resumption of talks on a trade and investment pact, Astuto said the EU “would be ready to start exploring a standalone investment agreement, as we believe it would be in our mutual interest to establish a stable legal framework for investments, which would give a positive signal in both directions”. He said: “Executive vice president Valdis Dombrovskis and commerce minister Piyush Goyal met for talks in February and are about to meet again. They will discuss the perspective of trade and investment agreements, but also the wider economic agenda. There is significant scope for broader exchanges and cooperation on issues such as reform of WTO, security of supply chains [and] regulatory issues.” With the EU recently unveiling a strategy to reinforce its presence in the Indo-Pacific, Astuto said the 27-member bloc “regards itself as a major stakeholder in this region and wants to work with like-minded partners, such as India”. He said the Indo-Pacific is a crucial manufacturing hub, central to global value chains and at the forefront of the digital economy. “The region is also key for climate change and the environment...In many ways, the path of the future world will be set in the Indo-Pacific region,” he added. The EU will develop its partnerships with India on foreign policy and security and defence, and this will include addressing challenges to maritime security, emerging and disruptive technologies, and countering terrorism or organised crime, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/o2-key-focus-of-support-to-india-eu-envoy-101619722663578.html
30-04-2021||India||Focus on local containment measures in worst-hit areas: MHA to states||The ministry of home affairs (MHA) on Thursday directed states and Union territories to follow intensive and local containment measures in districts with a high number of Covid-19 cases.The monthly directive, which will remain in force till May 31, however, had no mention about the imposition of a nationwide lockdown.The Centre has already allowed states/UTs to impose local lockdowns as per the situation in particular districts or the entire state.States/UTs must implement the containment measures suggested by the ministry of health and family welfare on April 25 which includes identifying districts, where either the tests positivity had been more than 10 percent or more in the last one week; or, where bed occupancy was more than 60 percent, the MHA order read.“Districts fulfilling any of the above two criteria should be considered for taking intensive and local containment measures,” it added.The containment framework shared by the health ministry has suggested containment as a major approach to flatten the pandemic curve.Night curfew, restricting intermingling of people, limiting crowd in marriages to 50 persons, prohibiting social/political/religious/sports gatherings, closing cinemas were among the measures recommended by the health ministry in its communication on April 25.At present, Delhi is observing a full lockdown till May 3 while Uttar Pradesh is following a weekend curfew since April 24.The Centre has also asked states to focus on ‘Test-Track-Treat-Vaccine’ strategy and implementation of Covid-19 appropriate behaviour across respective districts apart from door-to-door case search and adequate testing.On April 20, the Centre had also asked states to augment the testing and hospital infrastructure in advance for the next three weeks.In the last couple of days, the MHA also issued directions regarding smooth supply of oxygen in the affected states.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/focus-on-local-containment-measures-in-worst-hit-areas-mha-to-states-101619720820306.html
30-04-2021||India||Govt may raise sops for medical goods firms||The Union government has held at least two meetings during the course of the week to review the medical goods manufacturing sector, supply systems and manufacturing capacities, discussions which also focused on whether to expand sops currently applicable to the sector, such as the production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme announced last year, an official with knowledge of the matter said.The meetings assessed all current schemes available to the bio-medical goods and pharma sectors and ways to increase the pace of utilisation of the schemes, an official of the DV Sadananda Gowda-headed chemical and fertilizers ministry said, requesting not to be quoted.“Our focus continues to be on enhancing domestic production capacity and self-sufficiency in health care. It’s not just about the current situation but (about) long-term… (needs),” the official said.The government may pivot the focus of the PLI scheme to manufacturers of oxygen and oxygen products, ICU equipment, invasive ventilators and respiratory devices, the official said. These include Covid testing kits and devices, such as bipaps.“Demand for these types of equipment has increased and will increase in the future. We are constantly looking at what more is needed to boost domestic capacity,” the official said.India, which imported nearly ₹43,000 crore worth of medical equipment in 2018-19, according to the latest available data, has seen a crippling shortage of medical gear, as an unstoppable second wave of Covid-19 infections tears through the country.Several schemes came up for review. Two were approved by the Cabinet on March 21, 2020. One is the PLI scheme to boost domestic manufacturing of medical devices worth ₹3,420 crore over the next five fiscals. Two, schemes on promotion of medical device parks for financing common infrastructure facilities in four designated medical device parks, a scheme worth ₹400 crore.The PLI scheme offers eligible manufacturing companies and sectors a 4-6% incentive on incremental sales over the base year of 2019-20 for a five-year period. When a firm achieves a given sales target, it qualifies for the incentive.The base year is not simply a cut-off date. Analysts say it has had far-reaching consequences for the performance of the scheme, especially in the electronics and medical devices sector.Most modern medical devices have high-end electronic components. The massive problems of sourcing in the electronics sector, after India’s border conflagration with China, has had rippling effects on the medical devices sector too.“The PLI scheme captures (sales) milestone over a base year of production. If you change the base year to 2021 from the existing 2020, then you can tackle a lot of these sourcing issues,” said economist Pronab Sen.There is a “fair amount of legitimacy” to the demand to change the base year, but so far, the government hasn’t taken any decision, Sen added.Changing the base year to 2021 from 2020 would base the scheme in the year when supply disruptions have been most acute, requiring alternative sourcing.Prior to the border dispute with China, supplies were not a problem. Firms are still scrambling for alternative suppliers, whose specifications may not be the same as old suppliers, experts say.The changes in specifications have required new production lines to be established, which could take up to a year, even as India battles a shortage of medical equipment, Sen said.Firms have demanded enhancement of the 5% PLI scheme in the medical devices sector to 10%, which is the incentive rate for the auto sector, for instance. All issues were being reassessed in view of the Covid crisis, HT has learnt.The medical devices sector, which has the highest potential within the health care market, was valued at ₹50,026 crore for 2018-19. It is expected to reach ₹86,840 crore by 2021-22, according to official projections. India depends on imports of up 85% to meet its total domestic demand for medical devices.The scheme for promotion of medical device parks, announced along with the PLI scheme in 2020, covers cancer-care devices, imaging devices, cardio-respiratory gear, chochlear implants and pacemakers. Officials are weighing options to include ventilators, ICU equipment and oxygen equipment.“Our health care has traditionally focused on child and maternal health, which also is by no means adequate. We obviously require a massive boost now. Production incentives will add new investment but they are still small,” said health economist Arup Mitra of Delhi’s Institute of Economic Growth.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-may-raise-sops-for-medical-goods-firms-101619720708343.html
30-04-2021||India||76% turnout in last phase of Bengal polls||Kolkata Roughly 76% of the electorate voted in the final phase of the West Bengal assembly election on Thursday, ending a monthlong poll season that began with a tense political battle between the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Trinamool Congress (TMC) but was quickly overshadowed by surging Covid-19 infections. Voting in three districts and a part of Kolkata saw stray violence in some areas but a sharp spike in Covid cases kept many voters indoor. The provisional turnout of 76.07 % is the lowest of eight phases and came on a day the state posted its highest cases and deaths, 17,403 and 89, respectively. Results will be declared on May 2, along with those for Tamil Nadu, Assam, Kerala and Puducherry, where polls ended on April 6.“The polling was peaceful today, apart from a few incidents of violence,” chief electoral officer Aariz Aftab said. Daily infections in the state have zoomed 80 times since February 26, when poll dates were announced. The number of candidates and voters in the last phase was 2,116 and 72, 811, 254, (number seems wrong) respectively. The turnouts for the first to the seventh phases were 84.63%, 86.11%, 84.61%, 79.90%, 82.49%, 82% and 76.90%, respectively.The BJP is looking to wrest power from the TMC, which is looking for its third consecutive term. Polling for two seats will be held on May 16 due to the death of two candidates because of Covid-19On Thursday, polling was held in six seats in Malda, 11 each in Murshidabad and Birbhum and seven in the state capital. Fresh voting was also held at booth No 126 in the Sitalkuchi constituency of Cooch Behar district where four men were killed in firing by central armed police forces (CAPF) after local villagers allegedly attacked the forces during polling on April 10. Though no major violence was reported, the vehicles of Anirban Ganguly and Tarakeswar Saha, the BJP candidates from Bolpur and Nanoor in Birbhum district, respectively, were vandalised. TMC and BJP workers clashed at Maniktala and Beliaghata in north Kolkata. In Birbhum district, which is known for political violence and illegal bomb making units, crude bombs were recovered from several locations at Nanoor and Dubrajpur constituencies. There were clashes between BJP and TMC workers at several of the 11 constituencies that went to the polls. “The attack proves that the TMC government’s days are over. It does not matter that they smashed the windows of my car. What matters is that even women from that area voted for us,” said BJP national secretary Anupam Hazra. Chandranath Sinha, the TMC candidate from Bolpur, accused Ganguly of inciting people. “Polling was peaceful all over Birbhum. Trouble broke out only at places that Ganguly visited,” said Sinha.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/76-turnout-in-last-phase-of-bengal-polls-101619721524141.html
30-04-2021||India||Raj HC seeks reply from centre, state over Covid-19 vaccine pricing||JODHPUR: The Rajasthan High Court has sought responses from the central and state governments and vaccine manufacturers Serum Institute of India and Bharat Biotech on a petition challenging differential pricing of the vaccine for the Centre and the state, saying such pricing would hamper national vaccination strategy.A division bench of Justice Sabina and Justice MK Vyas passed the order while hearing a public interest litigation filed by Mukesh Sharma.The petition questioned the difference in pricing for the Centre and the states. Both vaccine makers sold their doses to the Centre at ₹150 a shot. Subsequently, in Phase 3, where states have to procure vaccines from the makers, the companies announced a price of ₹400 per dose for states (Covishield; Serum Institute) and ₹600 a dose (Covaxin; Bharat Biotech). On Wednesday, SII reduced this to ₹300 a dose and on Thursday, Bharat Biotech, ₹400 a dose. The petitioner said the prices quoted by manufacturers are not just higher but extremely discriminatory and arbitrary. Rajasthan’s chief minister Ashok Gehlot has last week announced that the state Government shall bear the cost of vaccination of all those above the age of 18 years. Most other states have made similar announcements. The court has set May 12 as the next date of hearing.In another case, the Rajasthan High Court has issued notices to the Centre and the state government on alleged discrimination in the supply of medical oxygen and lifesaving injections to the state. The court will hear that matter on Friday.A division bench of Chief Justice Inderjit Mohanty and Justice Inderjit Singh, heard the petition filed by Advocate Poonam Chand Bhandari, and asked the Centre and the state to respond. “As compared to the other states, the supply of oxygen support system, liquid oxygen and lifesaving injections such as, Remdesivir for treatment of COVID-19 has been much less in Rajasthan.The requirement of liquid oxygen is 220 metric tonnes per day, however, the allocation by the Central Government is 205 metric tonnes per day. There is a short supply of Remdesivir injections also..,” claimed Bhandari’s petition. .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/raj-hc-seeks-reply-from-centre-state-over-covid-19-vaccine-pricing-101619721403388.html
30-04-2021||India||Interpol again refuses Red Notice against Zakir Naik||New Delhi: Interpol has for the third time rejected India’s request for a Red Notice (RN) to provisionally arrest controversial television evangelist Zakir Naik while questioning the very basis of invoking money laundering and hate speech charges against Naik in the country.The fact that he raised money from his religious teachings and spent it is “irrelevant” and cannot amount to money laundering, Interpol’s adjudicating panel noted in its order, which has been reviewed by HT.Dismissing the evidence furnished by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) for the provisional arrest of Naik for extradition to India, the commission for the control of Interpol’s files noted that asking for donations during speeches and the recording or diffusion of speeches were not in itself a criminal act that could constitute the component of criminal offence for money laundering.While NIA claimed that Naik and his associates promoted enmity and hatred between different religious groups in India through public speeches and lectures, the Interpol panel highlighted that promoting religion and religious views could not be per se considered as committing a criminal act and there was no close link between the alleged incitement by Naik and any ensuing act of violence. It ordered deletion of data on Naik from Interpol files.Advocate S Hari Haran, representing Naik at various legal fora, confirmed the panel’s order, adding the parties received a copy of Interpol’s decision earlier this week. The order was passed following a deliberation by the Interpol panel between January 25 and 29.A spokesperson for NIA wasn’t available for comment. However, an official at the agency, requesting anonymity, said: “We are yet to receive any communication from Interpol but if that’s the case, we will examine the decision and definitely write back to Interpol and address the gaps in the request. His religious views were inflammatory and have inspired several youngsters to join terrorism. We provided detailed evidence on him and his organisation Islamic Research Foundation (IRF).”RNs are requests issued to Interpol’s 194 member states worldwide to locate and provisionally arrest or detain fugitives wanted either for prosecution or to serve a sentence.Naik is wanted in India for money laundering and hate speech and also for allegedly promoting enmity and hatred between religious communities. He fled India after the terrorists, who attacked a cafe in Bangladesh’s Dhaka and killed 22 people in July 2016, said they were Naik’s admirers. In November 2016, the Indian government banned Naik and his organisation Islamic Research Foundation (IRF) for five years. Naik is currently in Malaysia and has secured a permanent residency there.NIA, through the ministry of home affairs (MHA), made its first request to declare Naik an international fugitive in May 2017 but the Interpol panel turned it down, stating there was no charge sheet filed against him and that the charges were based on “vague” accusations.After this, NIA approached Interpol again following the filing of a charge sheet against Naik and IRF before a special court, Mumbai.In July 2019, the Interpol panel shot down the plea for a RN once again, underscoring that Naik was clearly a religious figure and any such action him could be perceived as taking a stance for or against a religious figure and create implications for its neutrality in view of varying positions taken by national entities.The third request was moved by the Indian government in December 2019, citing a different set of facts and changed circumstances but Naik contended that the fresh request superimposed allegations of money-laundering on the same religious activities of Islamic teaching that were targeted in the previous request.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/interpol-again-refuses-red-notice-against-zakir-naik-101619721199360.html
30-04-2021||India||Covid-19 second wave: Madras High Court raps Centre over preparedness||Chennai The Madras high court on Thursday asked questions of the Centre on preparedness and management of the Covid-19 pandemic, saying that the Union government should have acted in an informed and planned manner rather than taking ad-hoc measures.“Why are we acting only in April now even though we had time for one year?’’ asked the court.The bench comprising chief justice Sanjib Banerjee and justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy made the observations when the counsel for the central government, Additional Solicitor General (ASG) R Sankaranarayanan, submitted a list of measures taken by the Centre to contain the spread of the second wave.The submissions were made during the hearing of a suo motu case taken by the court to monitor the preparation of Tamil Nadu and Puducherry in handling the second wave of the pandemic.“I have not met any respectable doctor who has advised the guard to be dropped over the last few months... even if doctors have not advised, who are the experts the Centre has been consulting? We are in this state of absolute despair despite having lockdowns for most of last year,” the court said in its response to the ASG’s submissions that experts were looking into the surge.The chief justice also raised the issue of the pricing of Covid-19 vaccines and the crash of the server running the CoWIN application. The ASG assured the court that he would submit a detailed report by Friday.Regarding Tamil Nadu, advocate general Vijay Narayan said at the hearing that it may not be necessary to impose a lockdown on May 1 before the election counting day.“It’s a public holiday and also the first day of vaccination for people who are above 18,” he said. The government would, however, close all the meat and fish stalls to avoid crowding, he added.However, there would be a lockdown on counting day, May 2, which falls on a Sunday and the state has already imposed a full lockdown on Sundays. The state submitted that there will be no public gathering outside the counting venue and has directed social distancing, disinfection, ventilation in counting centres, number of counting tables as per the size of the room, thermal scanners, sanitisation, and PPE kits for counting agents.Accepting the submission, the bench appealed to all political parties to not have any mass congregations or celebrations at the time of counting to avoid the spread of Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2nd-covid-19-wave-madras-hc-raps-centre-over-preparedness-101619721283424.html
30-04-2021||India||PM held 21 meeting over 2nd wave in April||New Delhi: At least 21 official engagements of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in April, most done over the past two weeks, were related to the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic in India and the country’s management of it, underlining the crisis facing the country which is now seeing in excess of 350,000 new cases a day on average. This is the highest number of Covid-19 related reviews and meetings in which the Prime Minister has participated since March 2020, when he announced a strict federal lockdown. That month, the PM had 14 official engagements on Covid. The list of Covid-19 engagements of the PM in April included review meetings with union government officials, conferences with state chief ministers, dialogue with foreign leaders such as the ones he had with US President Joe Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin this week, and addresses to the nation. The PM has had at least 65 official engagements between March 2020 and April 2021 exclusively on Covid, according to the records in Press Information Bureau—the government’s publicity arm. Government officials claim that in addition, the PM has been talking to experts, political leaders and other stakeholders on the crisis, but that these are not listed as official engagements. Between January and March 2021, when India’s covid curve showed a temporary slump, the PM’s engagements on Covid reduced. This also coincided with the campaigning for the elections in four states and a Union Terriory. the Prime Minister campaigned heavily for his Bharatiya Janata Party , especially in West Bengal where elections were held in eight phases (the last phase was on Thursday). In March this year, the PM had just one Covid-19 engagement—a review meeting with all chief ministers on March 17—apart from taking his first Covid vaccine shot at AIIMS, Delhi. In February too, Modi had just one engagement related to the pandemic: addressing a workshop on “Covid-19 Management: Experience, Good Practices and Way Forward” with 10 Neighbouring Countries in his official programme. The PIB archive shows that in January, Modi had two official engagements: launching India’s vaccination campaign on January 16 and interacting with beneficiaries and vaccinators in Varanasi. After peaking in September, India’s first wave of Covid-19 infections tapered off, reaching a low of 10,988 new cases on average a week on February 11, 2021. The second wave emerged in February, powered likely by variants, the relaxation of Covid guidelines, and mass political and religious gatherings. Cases have soared since. As have hospitalisations. And crucial medical commodities such as oxygen have been found to be in short supply (or at least not available when and where they are needed).  In April alone, again, mostly in the past 10 days, the Prime Minister had five engagements only on oxygen—underlining the gravity of the situation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-held-21-meeting-over-2nd-wave-in-april-101619721223476.html
30-04-2021||India||India set to get assistance from 40 nations in Covid fight: Govt||New Delhi: India is set to receive support from more than 40 countries, mostly oxygen-related equipment and consignments of critical medicines, to bolster the country’s response to an “unprecedented second wave” of Covid-19 infections, foreign secretary Harsh Shringla said on Thursday. Shringla made the remarks at a news briefing hours after two Russian military aircraft flew in 20 oxygen production plants, ventilators and 200,000 medicine packs, while three special flights from the US were expected to bring in raw materials for Covid-19 vaccines, oxygen generating equipment and oxygen concentrators. The external affairs ministry is working with the health ministry and other agencies to expedite clearances and to ensure the equipment and medicines speedily reach areas where they are needed the most. Indian missions around the world have lists of urgently needed items – liquid oxygen, oxygen producing units and critical medicines such as Remdesivir and Tocilizumab – so that they can coordinate with foreign governments and corporations to expedite deliveries. “We are facing an unprecedented second wave of the pandemic. As of now, we have over three million active cases. This has obviously put considerable pressure on our healthcare system, on the capacities and resources that we have,” Shringla told the briefing. More than 40 countries, including major powers such as the US, Russia, France and Germany, have committed to provide much needed items and Indian and foreign corporations are helping with procurements. Indian community associations in many countries too are pitching in to provide relief materials. Shringla said India expects to receive more than 500 oxygen generating plants, more than 4,000 oxygen concentrators, more than 10,000 oxygen cylinders, and 17 cryogenic oxygen tankers. Biopharmaceutical major Gilead Sciences has offered 450,000 doses of the antiviral medication Remdesivir while India expects to get some 300,000 doses of Favipiravir from Russia and the United Arab Emirates, and consignments of Tocilizumab from Germany and Switzerland. Gilead and Roche Pharmaceuticals are helping expedite the supply of raw materials so that domestic production can be ramped up. Indian firms currently produce 67,000 doses of Remdesivir a day, whereas the requirement is 200,000 to 300,000 doses a day. Shringla said these firms expect to boost production to up to 400,000 doses once raw materials are brought in. Shringla was more circumspect on the issue of whether the support from other countries amounted to a shift from India’s policy decision after the 2004 tsunami on not accepting foreign aid. “I don’t think we are looking at it in policy terms, we are looking at it in terms of the situation that is very, very unusual, unprecedented and exceptional and we will do whatever it takes to meet the requirements of our people at this point of time,” he said in response to a question on whether there had been a policy shift. “The current situation is something we have never seen before and may never see again...We have certainly prioritised items that we need, we are sourcing many of these items from many countries, but many countries have come forward on their own to offer assistance,” he added. Many countries are responding to the situation in India because New Delhi played a proactive role in providing essential pharmaceutical products and even vaccines in the earlier phases of the pandemic, Shringla said, adding that US President Joe Biden and others had said they would assist India because it had provided help over the past year. India is open to acquiring vaccines from other countries for its immunisation programme till Indian manufacturers ramp up production. Vaccines should be seen in the context of an inter-dependent world with supply chains of raw materials and finished products, Shringla said. The country’s vaccine programme is based on international cooperation, including with the WHO-backed COVAX facility and Indian firms too have international connections for research and development. “Today, our needs are far greater, and all our partners understand that what we require is a ramping up of our vaccination programme. We have to go up significantly,” he said, adding all the existing capacity will be needed once the vaccination drive becomes universal for everyone above 18 years from May 1. “In that context, if we can source vaccines we will do it, whether it’s from the US, Russia or other countries,” he said. Officer on special duty Dammu Ravi, who played a crucial role in guiding India’s response in the initial stages of the pandemic last year, is again dealing with all Covid-19-related issues along with a group of young officers who are working 24x7. On the issue of accepting support from China, Shringla said: “We know that a number of companies in India are sourcing priority requirements, be they oxygen generators and concentrators, and some of it is being sourced from China. Cargo flights are operating...but I think this is part of meeting requirements in the most effective manner possible.” People familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that all international assistance would be exempted from taxes if it was approved by the government and routed to the Indian Red Cross Society. This includes government-to-government assistance and materials donated by corporate and individuals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-set-to-get-assistance-from-40-nations-in-covid-fight-govt-101619721043461.html
30-04-2021||India||Domestic travel bans can increase total number of Covid-19 infections: Research||A new study has concluded that policy makers should resist imposing domestic travel bans if they cannot commit to sufficiently long restrictions. Certain travel bans can not only cause severe hardship to the poor migrant population but also counter-intuitively lead to an increase in Covid-19 cases.This is because release of travel bans of intermediate duration are associated with an increase in the total number of infections in the country as the sink destination—where migrant workers (many of whom are likely to be infected due to the time spent in Covid-19 hot spots before being allowed to travel) return — also record a spike. This was seen in the case of Mumbai last year.The working paper by academics at the University of Chicago published in the Becker Friedman Institute for Economics’ website uses data from travel restrictions imposed in Mumbai during the first wave of Covid-19 last year. A nationwide lockdown was imposed on March 25 which caused immense suffering among migrant workers as the economy rapidly contracted and unemployment rose, according to the paper. Under intense pressure, the government allowed the first wave of migrants to return to homes outside Maharashtra on May 8 (Phase 1). Migrants returning to districts in the Mumbai Metropolitan Area were allowed to leave on June 5 (Phase 2); migrants departing to all other destinations were able to leave on August 20 (phase 3).Also Read | Around 500,000 left Maharashtra in special trains since April 1The researchers used the susceptible-exposed-infective-recovered (SEIR) model, commonly used to study epidemics, to understand the impact of the travel ban in Mumbai on cumulative infections. The approach uses the evolution of Covid-19 cases in each migrant home district from before a ban release and after the release. “After the bans are relaxed, we find that cases rise somewhat in Phase 1 districts (relatively short ban), substantially in Phase 2 districts (intermediate ban), and negligibly in Phase 3 districts (relatively long ban),” the paper states.“The national lockdown in the first wave trapped millions of migrants inside big cities like Mumbai that were fast-growing coronavirus hot spots. Eventually people were able to leave, but variations in government policy meant that the length of time they were detained depended on where they wanted to go. In the case of rural districts where people could return quicker – using the Shramik Special Trains for example – cases rose modestly at the destination. But for those areas where bans were in effect longer, there was a much more intensive increase in coronavirus, likely because the returning population was now more likely to be infected, having been trapped in the hot spot longer,” explained Anant Sudarshan, South Asia Director of The Energy Policy Institute at the university of Chicago and co-author of the paper.The paper refers to travel bans in China, Indonesia, the Philippines, South Africa, and Kenya. The ending of intermediate length bans in South Africa and India produced substantial excess cases per 1,000 migrants. In the Philippines, which had a slightly longer ban duration, ban release led to increase in cases, but to a lesser extent than India or South Africa. Kenya’s long travel ban also increased rural cases. In China, hot spot cases had fallen more quickly than in other countries, nearing zero at the time of ban release, the paper said.“The evidence indicates that if the duration of a travel ban is not long enough, we may end up imposing hardship on people while perversely seeing more spread of infection. Getting the duration wrong is easy because it is not possible to predict in advance what the optimal length should be, and in a democracy, such restrictions cannot be easily sustained. There may be merit in letting people go home early, and indeed encouraging them to do so, rather than forcing them to stay,” said Fiona Burlig, Assistant Professor at the Harris School of Public Policy at the University of Chicago, one of the co-authors of the study in a statement on Thursday.Some of the Covid-19 restrictions, such as large-scale lockdowns, are also associated with significant economic harm. These costs have been especially pronounced in developing countries, where economic slowdowns associated with Covid-19 policies combined with weak social safety nets were expected to push between 71–100 million people into extreme poverty in 2020, the paper said referring to World Bank estimates."Lockdowns with travel bans within a country are always the last resort. International travel bans are feasible because they are easily applied. Kumbh mela and lockdown are two extremes of a pendulum. Together they don't sound right. Why not consider universal mask wearing? It's the most effective way of slowing down infection transmission. Last year's Covid-19 number graphs show a smooth rise indicating the lockdown had no impact on the numbers. Limited restrictions like cutting down numbers to weddings, funerals other gatherings are more effective," said Lalit Kant, a scientist and former head of epidemiology and communicable diseases at the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/domestic-travel-bans-can-increase-total-number-of-covid-19-infections-research-101619699323201.html
30-04-2021||India||FB blocks hashtag against PM by ‘mistake’, later restores it||Facebook, late on Wednesday, blocked a hashtag “#ResignModi” for several hours before restoring it, claiming this was done by mistake, even as the Union government issued a statement saying it had not asked for anything to be blocked by Facebook. “We temporarily blocked this hashtag by mistake, not because the Indian government asked us to, and have since restored it,” a Facebook spokesperson said.The ministry of electronics and information technology echoed Facebook, and cited a Wall Street Journal story attributing the removal of a “certain hashtag” to the government of India’s efforts to curb public dissent. It called the story “misleading on facts and mischievous in intent”. In a series of posts on the microblogging site Koo, the ministry said the government has not issued any direction to remove this hashtag. “Facebook has also clarified that it was removed by mistake,” it said. The statement went on to make claims about another story in WSJ published earlier in March. India is in the grip of a surging second wave of Covid-19 infections, which have crossed the 350,000 daily cases mark over the past few days. The death toll has crossed 200,000, and both the Centre and the state governments have been criticised for their mismanagement of a situation that seemed in control even a month ago. The blocking and unblocking of the hashtag came days after the Centre issued orders to take down at least 100 “inflammatory” posts and accounts across Twitter, Facebook and Instagram related to Covid-19, including a verified Facebook page of West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee.The emergency blocking orders, under Section 69(A) of the Information Technology Act, were issued by the ministry of electronics and information technology on Friday, and came into force on Saturday. Rights activists have accused the government of stifling critical content, while the government argued that the decision was taken to counter Covid related misinformation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/facebook-unblocks-resignmodi-says-it-was-blocked-by-mistake-101619677901654.html
30-04-2021||Today's||At stake, a once-in-a-lifetime sporting opportunity||When her training camp in Sonepat shut down on April 19 in the wake of India’s Covid-19 surge, Paralympian archer Pooja Khanna had to return home to Rohtak. “In the camp I was safe. Here, every contact is a risk to my Olympic dream,” the 30-year-old said on the phone.The daughter of a scrap dealer, Khanna knows adversity. She has faced the challenge of being born a girl in a state with India’s worst sex ratio, being struck by polio at the age of two, exclusion as a Dalit even on the sports field, and poverty. Growing up, the sliver of hope came from watching women athletes on TV. “When I saw archer Deepika Kumari, I thought, ‘I can do that’.”“Shaadi karo, roti banao (get married, make rotis),” her father scoffed. But her mother was her secret ally. “She told me, ‘Go see the world. Don’t end up like me in the kitchen’.”In her first national competition in 2015, Khanna brought home a gold. In 2016 at Rio, she was India’s first archer to qualify for a Paralympics. Although she returned without a medal, she knew there would be another chance.With 86 days for the Olympics; 116 for Paralympics, time is running out. As cases mount at home and a new variant infects the world, there is ambiguity around the Games themselves: Will Indians be allowed to travel? Can athletes be accompanied by support teams? Would they require longer quarantines? How will they train under quarantine? There are no answers, but in Patiala, discus thrower Kamalpreet Kaur continues to train at the National Institute of Sports, even though her coach of the last seven years has not yet been allowed in. On March 19, Kaur qualified for Tokyo with her 65.06 metres throw at the 24th Federation Cup championship, breaching the Olympic qualifying mark of 63.5 metres as well as Krishna Poonia’s previous record of 64.76 metres. “I am so close to a medal,” she said. For most athletes, the Olympics is only a once, maybe twice, in a lifetime opportunity. For women, the journey battling prejudice, bullying and stereotypes about girls and sport is that much harder. “The ones who make it fight unimaginable challenges. They are role models for India,” said Deepthi Bopaiah, executive director of GoSports Foundation that prepares athletes for the Olympics and Paralympics, and is supporting 126 Olympian hopefuls, including Kaur and Khanna. Sport for most women has meant not just recognition, medals and jobs, but also freedom. “When they’re in camps, they are free from all social constraints,” said senior sports writer Sharda Ugra. But an athlete’s professional career tends to be brief, and women athletes have few job options post-retirement. “They live from cycle to cycle for as long as they can, till they slide back to marriage, motherhood and all the social rules,” said Ugra. For so many, like Khanna and Kaur, life, and the ongoing pandemic, may not offer a comeback.Namita Bhandare writes on gender The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/at-stake-a-once-in-a-lifetime-sporting-opportunity-101619788970752.html
30-04-2021||Today's||Where personal tragedy meets systemic State failure||Like an oncologist who gets cancer or a dermatologist who battles skin disease, this week, I became the story I have reported for the past fifteen months. I lost my father, Speedy Dutt, to Covid-19 and experienced every bit of the devastation, desolation, anger and anxiety that I have only so far chronicled in other families through the pandemic. My father, a former Air India official, but essentially an inventor at heart — a man who loved to sometimes break machines just so that he could have the joy of re-engineering them — was a twinkly-eyed, ever-optimistic man of science. He was an undemanding feminist father who gave my sister and me wings to fly, placing literally no demands on our time or emotion, while he spent hours crafting planes and trains built from mecanno. And he made us promise that when his time came, we would donate these to a children’s orphanage. Grief, like Covid-19, mutates and escapes the inoculation of both time and the reassurance of loving friends. It is less sledgehammer and more screwdriver, drilling little holes in your head and heart, leaving you haunted by the ifs and buts of your decisions. It’s not even been 72 hours since his death, as I write this on Friday, and every time I turn into his YouTube Channel (devoted to his meccano creations), I find myself collapsing in inconsolable tears, haunted for hours after by regret about all that was left unsaid and undone (including my failure to send Hindustan Times an article he wrote on the end of the 747 Jumbo that he was so keen to see in print).Also Read | Faster customs clearance to medical consignment to India: ChinaLike many elderly people, my father was not immediately keen to go to hospital. He dreaded not being able to see his family in what he feared might be his last few days. Initially, doctors believed that his infection was mild, his oxygen levels were stable and agreed that it was better to treat him within his comfort zone. He was home monitored by a fine team of doctors from Medanta. But when the spike came, it came suddenly, unexpectedly, both the rise in fever and the drop in oxygen levels. We panicked and organised a private ambulance in the belief that it would help us get him to hospital quicker than waiting for Medanta’s ambulance. What arrived was a broken down Maruti van with a single cylinder and a crew of one — the driver. He assured me the cylinder worked and he had the gear needed. We clambered on, me in the front seat, my father and his attendant at the back. He lay there uncomfortably on a slab for one hour as we navigated traffic. Despite pleas to the Delhi Police, there is still no green corridor for ambulances because randomly placed barricades to enforce the “curfew” are clogging up the streets. By the time we reached Medanta, his oxygen levels had fallen sharply and the emergency shift doctor believed he needed an intensive care unit (ICU) bed. It turned out that the cylinder in the van masquerading as an ambulance had faltered, and the mask he had been given was not the one meant for high-flow oxygen.

When we went to cremate him at the grounds closest to the hospital, I witnessed, as I have in multiple reports I have filed from funeral sites, the scrum for space. At least three other families had been given the same token number for a cremation at the same time. An argument ensued, a fight erupted, my sister had to call the police for help. As a journalist, I have often raised these questions; today they consume me as a daughter. Had the vaccination programme rolled out earlier, might my father have had a better chance at being alive? He had taken one shot and was due for his second the week he got Covid. Had I chosen a different ambulance or waited a bit longer, might he still be alive today? But I am also aware of my privilege through my crushing loss. At least he had a chance to fight for his life — unlike the thousands of Indians whose stories I tell everyday, who are dying at the gates of shut hospitals who have no space or oxygen for them. I am orphaned today, but still luckier than those who have been orphaned by the Indian State.

30-04-2021||Editorials||The May 2 challenge||On Thursday, Kerala reported 38,607 Covid-19 cases, among the highest in the country, and 48 deaths. West Bengal saw 17,503 cases and 89 deaths. Tamil Nadu had 17,897 cases and 109 deaths. Assam had 3,079 cases and 26 deaths. And Puducherry had 1,122 cases and 12 deaths. On Sunday, as results for the assembly elections in these four states and one Union Territory are declared, all the focus will be on the arithmetic in the House, vote share and seat share. But while elections have their sanctity, and the mandate of the people must be understood and respected, the real numbers that all these states — and their newly elected political leadership — should be focusing on should be related to Covid, be it the daily cases, seven day average, case fatality rate, positivity rate, and number of hospital beds, oxygen, and ventilators available for critical patients. There is no more pressing work for the central government and new state governments than tackling the biggest crisis independent India has faced. Elections in all these states posed a dilemma. It was common sense that crowded rallies enhance risks and exposure to the infection — yet, this was seen either as an inevitable byproduct of the need to maintain the democratic calendar or as an acceptable cost in the desire for political power by all parties. The Bihar experience of November 2020 gave the political class misplaced confidence that little would happen in terms of human costs. And the general narrative, pushed by the central government, that India had beaten the virus added to the sense of complacency. The Election Commission (EC) did not exercise the due judgment expected of it. And it was only in mid to late April, by when it was too late, that the EC and parties stepped back from campaigning as usual. This was, as this newspaper consistently argued, deeply irresponsible and put the lives of millions at risk.Yet, now that elections are done and results are due, it is time to focus on the immediate task at hand. Refrain from any celebrations. Ensure there is no violence after the result — especially in West Bengal, which has a history of political violence. Transition to a new government immediately, without the usual fanfare that accompanies swearing-in ceremonies. And with a singular focus, work on Covid-19 management. There is no time to waste.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/the-may-2-challenge-101619787660333.html
