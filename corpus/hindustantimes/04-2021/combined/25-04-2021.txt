25-04-2021||Chandigarh||Covid norms’ violations: Resort owner arrested, still no action against VIP guests||Police on Sunday arrested the owner of a luxury resort for breaching Covid protocols, conveniently turning a blind eye on those who had attended the event to celebrate the installation of first Congress mayor of Bathinda on Friday. Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) has accused the police of trying to protect the family members of finance minister Manpreet Badal who were also present at the event. Thermal police station in-charge Ravinder Singh said there was no evidence on who attended the party at Three Palms Resort, 6km away from Bathinda city. “After an input, I had visited the spot on Friday evening and did not find any person there. The attendees had probably left by the time we reached. It was found that the resort owner Rajeev Kumar had thrown another party after 9pm in violation of Covid-19 rules. He was arrested on Sunday and the resort was sealed,” said the SHO. No other person was named in the FIR. Rajeev was held under sections 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), 269 (negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life), 270 (malignant act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) of the Indian Penal Code and 51 Disaster Management Act. Rajeev could not be contacted for his comments. On Saturday night, the SHO had stated that the cars parked at the resort actually belonged to the staff. Senior deputy mayor Ashok Pradhan had confirmed to the media, that most of the 43 Congress councillors and party leaders had a brief social gathering after he, the mayor and deputy mayor assumed their offices on Friday. Pradhan had stated the event was hosted by Sandeep Goyal, the husband of mayor Raman Goyal. As photos and videos of the party were being shared widely on social media since Friday night, the police continued looking the other way. Bathinda range inspector general of police (IGP) Jaskaran Singh and senior superintendent of police (SSP) BS Virk did not respond to the phone calls of journalists who had gathered outside the resort and tried to flag the issue. Virk did not respond to the calls from Friday night till Saturday. “We are trying to identify who all violated Covid guidelines,” Virk said on Sunday afternoon. Former chief parliamentary secretary Sarup Chand Singla said photographs of Manpreet’s son Arjun Badal and the minister’s brother-in-law Jaijeet Johal, who manages Manpreet’s all political activities in Bathinda, in the media show them at a packed venue. “Instead of taking action on the basis of media reports based on councillors’ statements, the police are busy hushing up the matter. The CCTV footage from the resort should have been accessed to nail the violators,” said Singla. Manpreet’s media coordinator Harjot Sidhu did not respond to the query. Former mayor Balwant Rai Nath said it was unfortunate that the newly elected team of the municipal corporation indulged in such an unlawful activity on the very first day in office. “Police was quick in arresting eight people for hosting a pre-wedding function at Bathinda’s Civil Lines Club on Wednesday. In this case, the police are under political pressure and ignoring even the photographic evidence that are in the public domain,” said Nath.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/covid-norms-violations-resort-owner-arrested-still-no-action-against-vip-guests-101619373249194.html
25-04-2021||Gurugram||Health department asks for more ambulances, police re-purpose 20 vans for emergency use||The health department has asked the Gurugram district administration for seven additional Covid-19 dedicated ambulances due to the recent spike in cases and more people needing medical assistance, officials familiar with the matter said on Sunday. In a related development, the police department has also re-purposed 20 vans into ambulances to deal with the increasing demand.Dr MP Singh, district immunisation officer said in addition to nine existing ambulances, the health department has requested seven more. “With increasing cases, the demand is increasing. To tackle that, earlier this week, we wrote to the district administration requesting them to provide seven additional ambulances with advanced life support systems,” said Dr Singh. Of the nine ambulances currently in use, two have advanced life support systems, while others have basic life support systems. The health department has also deployed one ambulance each in Sohna and Pataudi blocks. In total, there are 24 ambulances at present. According to Dr Singh, in January and February, the 108 emergency helpline received six to eight calls each month, requesting ambulances for Covid-19 positive patients, which increased to over 100 in March. However, the health department is currently receiving 34-45 calls every day, due to the recent spike in Covid-19 cases.When asked if there are delays in taking patients to hospitals due to the increased demand, Singh said, “It does take a little time to follow all the procedures and take patients to hospitals, because we are mostly getting calls for transfers to patients being referred to other hospitals. Further, to make sure that patients are not made to wait on calls while requesting an ambulance, we are upgrading our technology in the 108-control room, which will be functional from this week.”At present, active cases in the district stand at over 25,000 with the health department expecting the number to rise. The positivity rate in the district is also around 25%. The district administration on Saturday held a review meeting and decided to increase beds, create more facilities and also enforce safeguards strictly. Officials said that people can also reach the health department on 7015663108, to request an ambulance. PCR vehicles turned into ambulancesThe police on Sunday converted 20 police control room (PCR) vans into ambulances to help with emergencies. KK Rao, the commissioner of police, said they are receiving multiple calls every day from distressed residents who are unable to get an ambulance. “It was seen that those in need were unable to get an ambulance due to shortage of them with the rising number of cases. Through this initiative, we are trying to help family members who need help in these difficult times,” he said. The police said that these 20 vehicles are stationed in different areas for quick response. Officials said that residents can call or send messages through WhatsApp on a dedicated helpline, 9999999953, launched on Sunday for Covid-related issues. The police said that residents can also send complaints about black marketing of medicines and suggestions on police action.Rao said all 41 station house officers (SHOs) have been directed to be on alert and to respond to all distress calls promptly. “These ambulances are for free, there are no charges and people should only use them in case of emergency. People should not occupy the beds in hospitals if not required,” he said. These ambulances will be used to shift patients with conformed beds in hospitals. Green corridors are created across the city in case of emergency, the police said. The police said that they have also enlisted a panel of doctors for providing free consultations to Covid-19 patients through calls and video conferencing. In other initiatives, the police are using MCG water cannon vehicles to spray disinfectant across the city, especially in crowded areas such as Sadar market, railway station, bus stand, community markets and near malls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/health-department-asks-for-more-ambulances-police-re-purpose-20-vans-for-emergency-use-101619373076244.html
25-04-2021||Gurugram||Hospitals report vaccine shortage, residents worried over second dose||Hospitals across the city are reporting a shortage of vaccines, due to which residents who have taken the first jab are concerned over the non-availability as they have to take the second jab within the stipulated time frame.Multi-speciality hospitals across the city said they are awaiting vaccine supply, with some not having received stock for four days. Many residents also took to social media expressing their concerns over the delay in getting vaccinated.Dr Vikram Singh, director of Aarvy hospital, located in Civil Lines and Sector 90, said that they have not received vaccines for the last four days. “There has been an acute shortage of vaccines. People are following up for their second jab, but they are unable to get them,” he said.Representatives of a private hospital in Sector 56 said they are struggling to get the supply of vaccines, while Artemis Hospitals has halted vaccination drives in residential societies and offices due to low stock.“The pace of vaccination has slowed down due to problems in supply of vaccines. Vaccination drive in residential societies and corporates/workplaces has been put on halt temporarily. We are hopeful that with the help of district administration we will soon overcome glitches and have our community vaccinated,” said Dr Anjali Kaul, medical superintendent, Artemis Hospitals Gurugram.In Gurugram, the vaccination drive is being conducted in 89 hospitals, including 37 government health centres and 52 private hospitals, said officials. However, officials of the health department refuted the allegations and said that sufficient doses of vaccines are available, even as private hospitals have put up messages outside vaccination rooms over the process being on hold due to non-availability of stock. Officials said that if the hospital where residents took their first shot does not have stock, they can take the second vaccine shot at another facility where stock is available.Officials said that the hospitals are getting the supply as per their demands on a daily basis. The district is replenishing its stock every three to four days, with no fixed quota, said officials. Dr MP Singh, district immunisation officer, said, “Sufficient vaccine doses, over 25,000, are currently available with the health department. The health department provides doses as per the requirement of the hospitals to avoid any vaccine wastage or stocking up of vials. In one particular case, the hospital concerned failed to provide the required doses, based on the footfall of vaccine beneficiaries.”The footfall of people turning up for vaccinations has increased due to the recent spikes in Covid-19 cases.On Sunday, 2,591 people received the first dose of vaccine, while 2,526 people took the second jab across session sites, said officials. So far, 464,840 have received vaccines, said officials.Senior citizens are concerned that they might have to restart the vaccination process if they are unable to take the vaccine doses on time.The Centre has recommended a gap of six to eight weeks between the two doses of Covishield vaccine, while a gap of four to six weeks is recommended for the Covaxin vaccine. Vimla Devi, (75), a resident of DLF Phase-3, said that she was due to take her second vaccine shot between April 15 and 25, but is waiting to do so as the hospital is yet to receive its stock. “I have been checking with the hospital for the last three days, but there is no supply,” she said.“I am worried now as there will be a rush in all hospitals after May 1 and with the current shortage of vaccines, those who need it will be ignored,” said Murti Sharma, a resident of Sector 54, who has been following up with a hospital in Sushant Lok-1 over vaccine shortage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/hospitals-report-vaccine-shortage-residents-worried-over-second-dose-101619373074808.html

Also, the oximeter is missing from Covid care kits being provided by the government to coronavirus patients, leaving families with no options but to buy their own. The family members of a 60-year-old Covid patient from Dhuri said they couldn’t buy the oximeter as it was available for a price much higher than what it should have been. People associated with the medical profession said oximeter was earlier available for ₹800 and now for ₹1,500 in the market. HT also enquired from a few medical shops and found that the oximeter was not readily available and could be provided in a couple of days for ₹1,500. District chief of Chemist Association Prem Garg said, “People are buying oximeters in panic. There is a shortage as the demand increased suddenly. But one can get the device within two days’ time.” A 70-year-old man from Sangrur town said he and his wife tested positive for the virus but they did not get an oximeter in the Covid care kit. “We are home isolated and unable to measure oxygen saturation,” he added. Sangrur assistant civil surgeon Dr Jagmohan Singh said the demand for oximeters increased due to a surge in cases. “Every family is buying an oximeter which led to a shortage of supply. The government is trying to provide oximeters to coronavirus patients in Covid care kits. The higher authorities are also thinking about reusing oximeters given earlier to patients who have recovered now,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/demand-for-oximeter-rises-in-sangrur-so-does-price-101619373073566.html
25-04-2021||Gurugram||50 shanties gutted in fire at Wazirabad village, no injuries||Around 50 shanties and stores were gutted in a massive fire that broke out at Wazirabad village in Sector 52 on Sunday night. No injuries were reported in the incident, said officials.According to fire department officials, the incident was reported at 12.15am on Sunday, following which seven fire tenders were sent to the spot, located near the Bihari market. It took fire department officials three hours to douse the flames and they were able to stop the fire from spreading to at least 100 more shanties in the area, said officials.“The cause of the fire is yet to be determined. Sporadic LPG cylinder blasts stored inside the shanties as well as strong winds aggravated the blaze. We doused the blaze within three hours and all fire tenders returned to their respective fire brigades by 4.30am,” said IS Kashyap, assistant divisional fire safety officer (ADFSO).Kashyap said that the fire department was able to control the blaze within an hour of starting the dousing operations, while ensuring the flames did not spread to an adjoining area, where 100 more shanties are located.Residents said that most of them were asleep as the fire broke out around midnight.“The fire broke out around midnight and most people were sleeping at the time. I was also sleeping. Two people woke me up and told me that a fire broke out. I left in a hurry. Within minutes, my shop was engulfed in flames,” said Musir, a resident, who owned a sugarcane shop in the vicinity.Residents said that around 40 shanties and 12 shops were gutted in the incident.“Besides the cylinder blasts, a hardware store too caught fire. Due to paints and chemicals stored inside, the store was highly flammable, and it further aggravated the blaze. I have been staying here for the past five years. Suddenly, I am left without a home and my daily source of income,” said Musir.Of the 100 shanties that were saved, 22 were unoccupied and those affected have relocated there temporarily.“The contractor owning the shanties has adjusted everyone in the unoccupied shanties. These were constructed recently and hence, were empty. Four to five people are staying in each of these shanties temporarily. The contractor said that all gutted items will be removed by Tuesday and by Thursday, 20 new shanties will be erected so that those displaced can have a home once again,” said Tamim, a ragpicker, whose shanty was also gutted in the incident. It is the third such major fire incident this month that broke out among a cluster of shanties.On April 3, over 180 shanties were gutted in Nathupur village, and on April 11, over 100 shanties and structures storing scrap and plastic waste were gutted after a fire broke out at a field in Naharpur Kasan, near Sector 6 of Manesar. No injuries were reported in both incidents.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/50-shanties-gutted-in-fire-at-wazirabad-village-no-injuries-101619373074077.html
25-04-2021||Gurugram||Gurugram health dept to set up independent quarantine centres with oxygen beds soon||As the plan to increase hospital beds in Gurugram is still under execution, the district health department on Saturday recommended setting up independent quarantine centres with oxygen beds, in collaboration with private companies, philanthropists, and welfare trusts in the city.The reason for setting up the proposed 100-bed quarantine centres is that the number of critical Covid-19 patients who require oxygen support is expected to rise further. The proposal was discussed during a review meeting held under the chairmanship of TC Gupta, additional chief secretary, Haryana — who is also the nodal officer for Covid-19 related issues in Gurugram. Besides the proposal to set up quarantine centres, Gupta also asked the nodal officers to ensure that the hospital beds were made available to critical patients.Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer (CMO), said that the number of cases were expected to increase, and there was an urgent need to create independent quarantine centres for critical patients, apart from augmenting bed capacity in the hospitals. “It was decided in today’s meeting that the hospital beds will be increased by 1,000. But our key proposal is to collaborate with private sector firms, trusts, and philanthropists to set up quarantine centres of 100 beds with oxygen support,” Yadav said, adding that these facilities could be set up at community centres, banquet halls, and other such places.Private companies can also set up such facilities under the corporate social responsibility programme, and city-based developers can come forward to set up such large-scale quarantine centres. “We could also utilise vacant towers in a newly built unoccupied project to create such a facility,” said a health department official, requesting anonymity.In a related development, Rao Inderjit Singh, MP, Gurugram, released ₹50 lakh to the district administrations of Gurugram, Rewari and Mewat from the Member of Parliament Local Area Development Scheme (MPLADS) fund on Saturday for the immediate purchase of essential medicines and equipment. “I have decided to release this money for the immediate purchase of medicines and other equipment needed for Covid-19 patients. More money from the MPLADS fund would be released as and when required,” said Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gurugram-health-dept-to-set-up-independent-quarantine-centres-with-oxygen-beds-soon-101619373067007.html
25-04-2021||Gurugram||Rewari resident arrested for black marketing remdesivir||A Rewari resident was arrested for black marketing remdesivir, a broad-spectrum antiviral medication, and charging ₹23,000 per vial even as a shortage continues in the market, the police said.In a joint raid by the chief minister’s flying squad and district drug controller on Saturday night, a decoy customer was sent to buy the injection, at a mobile shop, and the suspect was arrested while delivering the medication, the police said.Remdesivir is being used to treat critically ill Covid-19 patients, although experts have said that it is not a sure-shot treatment. The demand for remdesivir has shot up over the last month, with an unprecedented spike in Covid-19 cases and those having access to the medicine are hoarding them to make a quick buck, the police said.To be sure, seven companies producing remdesivir in India have slashed prices by an average of 39%, with the costliest variant, offered by Hetero Healthcare, is priced at ₹3,490 for a 100mg vial.The police identified the suspect as Rahul, of Chauki Bareilly village in Rewari, who worked as a compounder in a hospital, from where he allegedly stole the medicines.Inderjeet Yadav, deputy superintendent of police, crime investigation department (CID), said they received a tip-off, following which they asked a decoy customer to call the suspect and ask for a delivery. “ Rahul asked him to pay ₹23,000 for remdesivir injection to an associate at a mobile shop. The decoy, along with the police team, went to buy the injection and caught him red-handed while he was delivering the injection,” he said.Harish Budhiraja, inspector, chief minister’s flying squad, said that they conducted a reconnaissance of the area on Tuesday. “We are yet to verify details from where the injection was supplied to the private hospital and how Rahul stole them. The number of vials and the persons who bought them are also being ascertained,” he said.A case was registered at Rewari police station, and after his arrest, police recovered one remdesivir injection and a mobile phone from his possession.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/rewari-resident-arrested-for-black-marketing-remdesivir-101619373008791.html
25-04-2021||Gurugram||Oxygen only for medical use, supply to Gurugram increased||The state government on Sunday banned the supply of oxygen to industrial units, barring a few key exceptions, to ensure adequate stock of medical supply for treatment of Covid-19 patients, even as the authorities increased the allocation of oxygen to Gurugram to 35 metric tonnes (MT). Officials familiar with the developments said that an additional stock of 10 MT will be available with the district administration for emergencies.Invoking the powers conferred under Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897, the state government prohibited all oxygen manufacturers and suppliers from providing oxygen to industries. All oxygen units were also directed to dedicate complete supply for medical purposes and also to ensure production of maximum capacity. Rajiv Arora, additional chief secretary, health, said that a call centre has also been set up to monitor the oxygen supply in all the districts. “Based on the daily feedback From the chief medical officers (CMOs), any area facing shortage will be supplied gas on priority,” he said in a statement on Sunday. The industries exempted from the oxygen ban are pharmaceutical companies, petroleum refineries, steel plants, nuclear energy plants, oxygen cylinder producers, waste treatment plants, food and water purification establishments, process industries with furnaces, ampule and vial makers. Gurugram’s deputy commissioner on Sunday also formed an eight-member committee to devise a district-level oxygen distribution and monitoring plan for the city. The committee will assess the average oxygen requirement of the district, individual requirement of hospitals, current availability, and projected requirement for at least the next four days, an order issued by Garg stated. “Accordingly, movement of oxygen tankers should be planned. The team should have a list of all supplies and vendors including Air Liquide, Panipat (from where oxygen is supplied). The committee shall also be responsible for preparing a daily oxygen distribution plan, distributing oxygen rationally,” the order issued by Garg, a copy of which is with Hindustan Times, stated.The eight-member committee comprises seven officials of the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) and one official of the Gurugram police department. The district administration also observed that private hospitals first assure them that oxygen supply was adequate but later make distress calls on social media, which creates panic. “These issues are also posted on Twitter and it creates panic. Today, a private hospital was supplied oxygen in Palam Vihar after it flagged the matter on social media,” a spokesperson for the district administration said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/oxygen-only-for-medical-use-supply-to-gurugram-increased-101619373008258.html

A triple layer mask is important to cover the face and especially, the nose,” said Garg.Officials of the district administration said that another problem is that people who were awaiting test results were not isolating despite exhibiting symptoms of Covid-19. Garg appealed to all residents who are suspected to have Covid-19 to isolate themselves and get tested at the earliest. Those flouting norms were warned of action under the sections of the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897, and The Disaster Management Act, 2005.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/3410-new-infections-take-caseload-past-100000-101619373007676.html
25-04-2021||Chandigarh||Pvt operators may pull buses off road amid fresh curbs||AMRITSAR Having already lost women passengers due to government’s free ride scheme in state-run buses, capping the passenger capacity at 50% has pushed the private operators to the brink and they are contemplating shut operations. Due to the free ride facility, the women prefer to board government buses. “We are already facing loss due to the facility provided by the government to women in government buses. As per the fresh order of the government of limiting the number of passengers in buses, a normal bus cannot ferry more than 25 passengers. In such a situation, we earn less than what the ride costs,” said Choudhary Ashok Manan, who runs a small transport company that runs buses between Amritsar and Dera Baba Nanak. Manan who is also member of Amritsar-Gurdaspur Bus Operator Association, said, “We are not able to meet expenses of fuel since the number of passengers was capped. Police are registering FIRs against bus owners for violation and imposing a fine of ₹9,000.” Baldev Singh Babbu, president, Punjab Mini-Bus Operators Union, said, “Sunday lockdown also affects us a lot. We are already facing a big financial crisis in times of Covid-19 and not able to give salaries to our employees. How can we tackle the situation?” The bus operator unions from across the state will conduct a meeting in Jalandhar on Monday. Punjab Motor Union president and former Congress MLA Avtar Henry will preside over the meeting to chalk out further course of action. “We have planned to take the buses off road. We won’t operate buses until we get relief from the government. We will announce it after a meeting in Jalandhar on Monday. Not only we but drivers, conductors and other employees working in the bus operating companies will also be affected and the government will be responsible for it,” added Babbu. It is worth mentioning here that many private bus operators took their vehicles off road during the post-lockdown period last year as livelihoods of thousands were hit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/pvt-operators-may-pull-buses-off-road-amid-fresh-curbs-101619372827586.html

The Bar council chairman Minderjeet Yadav said the decision was taken in view of a request from Kunwar Vijay on the same on Sunday. A section of lawyers on Saturday had opposed the Bar council’s decision to appoint Kunwar Vijay as a member of its disciplinary committee. He was given licence and appointed as a member of the said panel on Friday. The move had coincided with a high court bench questioning Kunwar Vijay’s role as Punjab Police’s special investigation team (SIT) member in the 2015 Kotkapura police firing case probe. The disciplinary committee of the Bar council, which has more than 1-lakh members from Punjab, Haryana and Chandigarh, including lawyers in the high court, investigates complaints against lawyers. Former secretary of the Punjab and Haryana High Court Bar Association Baltej Singh Sidhu, too, had written to Bar council stating that the move is in total violation of section 9 of the Advocates Act, 1961. Kunwar Vijay, who did his bachelor of law (LLB) from Panjab University in 2010, approached the council for licence after he opted for voluntary retirement from Punjab Police in the aftermath of the high court judgment of April 9.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/bar-council-withdraws-kunwar-vijay-s-nomination-to-disciplinary-panel-101619372587568.html

These two tankers came from Jamshedpur in Jharkhand. The Varanasi police created a 275-kilometre green corridor and escorted them to the oxygen plant. One tanker was escorted from Dehri-on-Sone and the other from Gaya, both in Bihar. Each oxygen tanker contained around 14,000 litres of liquid medical oxygen (LMO). Varanasi commissioner of police A Satish Ganesh said the two oxygen tankers started their journey from Jamshedpur on Saturday afternoon. According to officials, police teams will escort all the oxygen tankers that would arrive in Varanasi in the next few days. Earlier, an oxygen tanker arrived in Varanasi by road on Friday and another tanker reached the city by the Oxygen Express train early Saturday. Both the tankers came from Bokaro in Jharkhand. Varanasi had faced a medical oxygen crisis on Thursday. However, the oxygen supply situation to the hospitals here almost became normal since Friday following the arrival of tankers. In Varanasi, 43 hospitals are treating Covid-19 patients. There are around two dozen distributors of oxygen cylinders in the city at present. But they are running short of empty cylinders. People in home isolation needing oxygen are getting refilled oxygen cylinders from oxygen plants in the Chandauli area adjoining Varanasi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/two-more-oxygen-tankers-arrive-in-ramnagar-near-varanasi-101619371506996.html

These vaccines would be in addition to what the central government was providing, he said at a Covid-19 review meeting. “To ensure the availability of adequate doses in the state, the state government has ordered to procure 50 lakh doses of Covishield and Covaxin each from the manufacturing companies. The Covishield vaccine is manufactured by Serum Institute of India and Covaxin is manufactured by Bharat Biotech Limited. The one crore additional vaccines are other than what the central government has allocated UP,” a state government said. The government statement quoted Dr RK Dhiman, director of Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences (SGPGIMS), as saying, “We can avoid hospitalisation by getting vaccinated. Not only this, the death rate also decreases due to vaccination. In such a situation, it is very important for us to get the vaccination done”. Speaking from his personal experience, Dhiman said, “My wife and I had become Covid positive just three days before the Holi festival. But the infection was mild and did not have much effect on us.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/up-orders-1-crore-additional-vaccine-doses-101619371026918.html
25-04-2021||Other||No Covid hospital can deny treatment: Yogi||Chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Sunday said that no Covid-19 hospital, government or private, can deny treatment to any patient of the coronavirus disease. Even those patients who only have an antigen test positive report must immediately be provided suitable treatment, he emphasised at a virtual Covid-19 review meeting with senior officials here. The government will bear the cost of such treatment as per the rules, but the treatment must be provided without delay, he added. “No patient should be without a bed. If government hospitals don’t have a vacant bed, then the patient should be admitted to a private hospital. The government will foot the bill according to the norms set for this. If a patient is without a bed, then the district magistrate and the chief medical officer of the district concerned will be accountable,” he said. Yogi said the Drug Controller General of India recently granted emergency use approval to Zydus Cadila’s anti-viral drug Virafin. He asked for making this drug available in Lucknow, Prayagraj and Varanasi. The chief minister asked health department officers to provide all necessary resources to DRDO (Defence Research and Development Organisation) for the Covid-19 hospitals it is setting up in Varanasi and Lucknow. These hospitals will be operational soon and will lead to further consolidation of health services for Covid-19 care in the state, he said according to a statement issued by the state government. In the last 24 hours, a total of 35,614 new Covid-19 cases came up in Uttar Pradesh and 25,633 patients were discharged after recovery, he said. A total of 7.77 lakh patients had recovered since the outbreak in UP early last year. In the last four days, the number of Covid beds had been increased by 14,000 and there was a need to further increase the bed strength for which the health department should explore options, he said. He also asked the officers concerned to get in touch with Indian Institute of Technology-Kanpur (IIT-K), Indian Institute of Management-Lucknow (IIM-L) and IIT-BHU for oxygen audit in cities. Similarly, they should rope in Dr APJ Abdul Kalam Technical University (AKTU)-Lucknow, Madan Mohan Malviya University of Technology (MMMUT), Gorakhpur, Harcourt Butler Technical University (HBTU)-Kanpur, and Moti Lal Nehru National Institute of Technology (MNNIT)-Prayagraj for the oxygen audit. “Allot districts near each of these institutes for oxygen audit so that oxygen demand and supply could be tracked,” he said. “There is a need to increase the number of oxygen tankers,” he said to the officers concerned and reiterated that work to set up oxygen plants at all hospitals with a bed strength of 100 or more must be speeded up. About Remdesivir injections, he said that the state was getting 18,000 to 20,000 vials every day. The central government has increased Remdesivir allocation to 1.6 lakh for UP. Besides, state government was in direct touch with various Remdesivir-making drug companies for more vials, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/no-covid-hospital-can-deny-treatment-yogi-101619370846967.html

Several MLAs and ministers have already allocated fund from MLALAD.Principal secretary (rural development) K Ravindra Nayak said the state government had issued orders that the procurement of instruments, beds and installation of oxygen plants can be done according to the guidelines of the ministry of health and family welfare.The MLAs can also allocate funds to Banaras Hindu University and Aligarh Muslim University, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/mla-funds-to-help-create-oxygen-infrastructure-in-up-101619370606952.html
25-04-2021||Lucknow||Congress, BJP in war of words over oxygen tanker||Amid the ongoing Covid-19 crisis, political slugfest began in Uttar Pradesh as the Congress government in Chhattisgarh announced it was sending oxygen for a private hospital in Lucknow. “On being informed by Priyanka Gandhiji on phone about acute crisis of oxygen in Lucknow, a tanker of oxygen has been sent for Medanta Hospital in Lucknow,” Chhattisgarh chief minister Bhupesh Baghel tweeted. He signed off his tweet with “sabhi swasthya rahein (may all be healthy).” The tanker carrying 16 tons of oxygen showed the party’s concern for the common man in the state, Congress leaders said. Uttar Pradesh Congress chief Ajay Kumar ‘Lallu’ and other party leaders in the state took to twitter to thank the Chhattisgarh chief minister even as his party leaders, including former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi and party’s UP in-charge Priyanka Gandhi Vadra targeted the BJP, accusing it of hiding the reality. Almost immediately, UP BJP spokesman Navin Srivastava took to twitter to target the Congress leadership, wondering if the tanker on which oxygen was being sent to the state was “real”. “Is it actually a tanker? Last time instead of buses, numbers of auto and motorcycles were given,” Srivastava tweeted, reviving memories of the bitter controversy that broke out last year. Back then, BJP claimed there were flaws in the Congress’s offer to send buses to bring back such migrant labourers who were stuck on UP borders due to nationwide lockdown during the first corona wave. Other BJP leaders, including several lawmakers, started targeting the Congress. “Priyanka ji shouldn’t be engaging in political stunts,” said BJP lawmaker Deomani Dwivedi, reacting to the Congress leadership’s criticism of the state government’s handling of Covid situation in the state in general and the “oxygen crisis” in particular. The Yogi Adityanath government has decided to conduct an oxygen audit, an exercise through which it hopes to check the demand and supply requirements. Both the Congress and the BJP have been speaking of using the cadre to help the Covid-hit people of the state. While the BJP has issued a toll-free helpline number for the needy, party leaders said the BJP is also setting up helpdesks across the districts to disseminate information. The Congress spoke of activating its Seva Dal workers. Both parties are contesting the ongoing panchayat polls in the state and looking at these rural polls as an opportunity to connect with the people ahead of 2022 UP polls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/congress-bjp-in-war-of-words-over-oxygen-tanker-101619370426841.html

This is the first time in this period that normal pressure has been achieved," an official said.The hospital received 3 MT of oxygen around 6 pm, which will last up to midnight."The hospital did not have to press the panic button the whole day. No SOS calls were made. We hope the night also passes peacefully," the official said.The hospital had raised an alarm at 10:30 pm on Saturday, saying its oxygen stock would last only an hour. There were 130 patients in the ICU, including 30 on invasive ventilation, when the SOS was sent.Around 12:20 am, it received a tanker, with the help of local AAP MLA Raghav Chadha, which supplied one metric tonne of oxygen, averting an impending crisis."It should last two hours," a hospital spokesperson had said around 12:45 pm.According to him, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital's primary supplier in Faridabad was supposed to send a tanker before 3 am.The tanker finally arrived at 4:15 am and delivered 5 metric tonnes of medical oxygen, the highest volume that the hospital has received in the last three days in one refill, he said.Another tanker delivered one MT oxygen at 12:24 pm.A third tanker arrived around 6 PM and delivered three MT of oxygen, which should last up to midnight.Some hospitals in the national capital continued to grapple with severe shortage of medical oxygen on Saturday even after receiving emergency supplies with the help of the Delhi government and the police.While some hospitals have managed to make short-term arrangements, there is no immediate end to the crisis in sight.At least two private hospitals in Delhi -- Saroj Super Speciality Hospital in Rohini and Batra Hospital in Tughlakabad Institutional Area -- on Saturday asked families of patients to shift them to other healthcare facilities in view of oxygen shortage.Sir Ganga Ram Hospital on Friday reported the death of 25 of its "sickest" patients as the administration grappled with depleting oxygen supplies."I appeal to both the Centre and the state to help. On one hand, they increased COVID beds and on the other, they can't supply oxygen in sufficient quantity. How are we supposed to work?" the hospital's chairman Dr D S Rana said."If this is COVID tsunami and the government has invoked the Disaster Management Act, then they should work according to it. We need immediate intervention," he said.Dr Rana also said, "The government is doing its best but, perhaps, they too are helpless. But then they should admit it and reduce patient intake."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhis-ganga-ram-hospital-achieves-normal-oxygen-pressure-after-3-days-101619366189141.html

25-04-2021||Pune||Summer camps move online in pandemic-hit year||After examinations were called off this year due to the Covid-19 pandemic, school-going children have begun attending their summer camps, online. The children have been primarily restricted at home with engaging online activities such as drama, storytelling, speech competitions, and arts. Many organisations are now solely dependent on the online structure due to the strict restrictions enforced by the Maharashtra government. The Rangbhasha organisation in the city has been instrumental in training children in drama and theatre. As offline sessions are not possible in the current situation, special online courses have been designed. “We have batches for the age groups of seven to 10 and 11-14 and there is a good response for the online sessions. We used to conduct in-person batches in the pre-Covid period, but it is not possible now. We are getting good responses from the Marathi families who are abroad. Now that the sessions are online, children from overseas are also able to join the batches,” said Amut Samak, founder, Rangbhasha. The in-person touch and the field surely remain missing from the online sessions; however, the organisers are thoroughly planning the sessions to make them more interactive and productive. “Just two days ago we conducted a session on the art of paper cutting. We were a little doubtful if children will be able to understand the instructions online, but it turned out very well. Children were enthusiastic to make items from paper. We have a series of sessions planned for them,” Harshada Pendharkar head, Bhintibaherchi Shala (School beyond walls) “Some online sessions are fun. I loved the paper cutting session with my sister. Whatever I learned I taught it to other children in my building,” said Aditi Pande, a student who attended the online session.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/summer-camps-move-online-in-pandemic-hit-year-101619365266551.html
25-04-2021||Pune||Parents demand state board to return Class 10 exam fee||Parents of Class 10 students have demanded that the Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Certificate (MSBSHSE) return the examination fees of ₹500, since there will be no exam this year. Pragati Kulkarni, mother of a student in 10th standard said that the board has not refunded the fee as of yet. “We paid the exam fee when the exams were declared. As the exams are cancelled, the fee should be refunded to us. Even though it is a small amount for many, for some families it is a huge amount. Also, if the exams are not conducted offline, then the fees should be refunded,” said Kulkarni. Every class 10 student had to pay ₹500 each ahead of the final board exam as exam fees. As per MSBSHSE, this year, 16, 00,249 students were registered with the board to appear for Class 10 examination. The total funds for this year amount to around ₹80 crore. However, the state board has gone ahead with the preparations to take offline exams and many sources suggest that some part of the fee may be utilised. Medha Sinnarkar, principal of Apte Prashala said that the board has already started with the preparations for offline exams and most part of the funds must be already utilised. “The board charges the exam fees as they have to set papers and invite teachers of various subjects to set papers. Also, the basic stationary like answer sheets are also provided to the schools by the state board. Also, the questions are printed which also requires funds. As the board was all set to take the offline exams. They would have already spent at least one-fourth of the sum,” said Sinnarkar. She further added that question papers are also transported to various centres across Maharashtra. “All these arrangements are required to be done by the board. So, some of the funds may have been utilised,” said Sinnarkar. Harishchandra Gaikwad, president of the Pune district principals’ association said that the board has already set the papers. “Some question papers were already printed by the board. Also, the paper setters are given some remuneration which is part of the expenditure. As the board had planned offline exams, the planning and action was already done by the board,” said Gaikwad. He further added that as the decision of how the students of Class 10 will be evaluated, is not taken yet, the board may take time to refund the fee. “As discussions are still ongoing about how Class 10 students will be evaluated this year, the board is taking time to refund the fee. This is the first time in the history that Class 10 exams were cancelled and hence there is a delay in the decision,” said Gaikwad. There was no response from officials of the MSBSHSE, despite several attempts to reach them over call and messages.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/parents-demand-state-board-to-return-class-10-exam-fee-101619365146537.html

The Satara rural police are accompanied by local district officials, home guards and Sarola village gram panchayat workers. In some cases, the vehicle is allowed to proceed without an e-pass after verifying the reason to travel, such vehicles are charged ₹500 by the local gram panchayat workers.“Each and every vehicle is strictly checked by our policemen, and those having valid police e-pass to travel are being allowed to go ahead. As this system has been newly started from the last two days, passengers without e-pass are fined ₹500 and then sent after verifying their emergency reasons. There are many passengers who are in a rush for medical emergencies but don’t have an e-pass, so we fine them and allow to proceed. All others are sent back to Pune district from this check post,” said police sub-inspector Vrushali Shinde attached to the Shirwal police station. All non-essential travel has been suspended by the Maharashtra government, and the district borders have been sealed after the e-pass enforcement to travel outside Pune came into effect. No strict checking is being done at the Khed Shivapur Toll Naka by the Pune rural police.The Pune district border ends near the Sarola Bridge over Neera river just before Shirwal city on the highway. The barricading has been placed from the middle of bridge, where goods carrying vehicles and private vehicles are separated in two lanes for checking. A staff of around 10 to 15 policemen, including traffic police is deployed in two shifts round the clock at this check post. All the emergency services vehicles allowed by the state government and people with valid e-pass are only allowed to pass. Even the buses of companies and other private works are not allowed. Kiran Sakhare, a passenger travelling from the check post said, “My brother is serious in Sangli and I had come to Pune to get some medicines for him. I did not know about the new e-pass system, but it is emergency situation for our family. I paid the fine and now headed to Sangli.” Similarly, at the Khed Shivapur toll naka, Pune rural police have deployed their policemen at the check post but there is no strict checking going on here, as vehicles are randomly checked as it falls under the Pune district jurisdiction.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/satara-rural-police-barricade-district-border-all-vehicles-scanned-for-epasses-101619365026508.html

The Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) expects fresh stock of Tocilizumab and Itolizumab to only be available by April 28. A senior FDA official said, “There is absolutely no stock available in Pune or, the nearby districts. We are getting calls from everyone including references from the district collector and also the health minister and CM’s office, but since we do not have any stock there is no way we can help them.” Dinesh Khivasara, drug Inspector, FDA, Pune, said, “Both Tocilizumab and Itolizumab are not available in the district since April 15 and fresh stock is expected to come only by April 27-28. The medical firm had stopped importing the drug as it did not find it useful in treating Covid-19 patients. However, now, since demand has gone up they have started importing it again and hopefully we will get fresh stock soon.” Patients are now left to fend for themselves and some have had to travel to nearby districts to get the drugs. In one such case, a patient’s relative in Pune tried to source the medicine while the patient was admitted in Baramati. The relative, requesting anonymity, said, “My distant relative is admitted ad I tried calling FDA officials and also the chemist association, but none of them have the stock and they have told us that the new stock will come only in the next few days. We are trying to source the medicine from Mumbai, or nearby districts, but until we know for sure we cannot risk travelling.” Two such patients, both from Vishwaraj Hospital located in Dhanori in Pune, and have been prescribed Tocilizumab. One relative said, “Ideally, the hospital should have the medicine. We are also trying to find the injection from Mumbai and Delhi, but it is not available anywhere.” The relative of the other Covid patient said, “The patient is 61- years old and the entire family has tested positive, so they are not able to move out. We are in West Bengal now and using social media contacts to get the medicine. We even called our known contacts in Delhi to see if they can get the drug, but it is not available anywhere.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/pune-facing-acute-shortage-of-tocilizumab-itolizumab-both-used-for-treatment-of-covid19-101619359746163.html

They are also appealing to youth to donate blood before the vaccination drive for those above the age of 18 kicks off in the city. “According to government guidelines, after vaccination, a person cannot donate blood for 28 days. What we need is to appeal to youth to donate blood before they are vaccinated,” said Dr Chinmay Umarji, who held a blood donation drive on Sunday. Vaibhav Wagh, heading the Vande Mataram Sanghatana, said, “Everyday, we get as many as 100 phone calls asking for help with injections, beds and plasma donations to save the lives of friends and families. Since we can’t do much in terms of getting injections, we decided to look at plasma donation as a segment, where if we worked together as a group we could help get donations faster.” He conceived the idea of the Plasma Premier League which kickstarted on April 14. “The idea is to appeal to thousands of people to come forward and donate plasma, by offering prizes of ₹50,000, ₹30,000 and ₹20,000. We have 10 teams in Maharashtra participating and we have tied up with the PMC to help us connect with recovered patients,” said Wagh. It is not easy to convince recovered patients to donate. Rohit Dhayarkar of Swaroop Vardini is one of the participants in the PlasmaPremier League. He said, “Each team is given a target of getting 100 donors to agree and donate. We have a list of people to call, but it is taking time to convince people to come forward and donate blood or plasma. Most often the patients are afraid of weakness or of contracting corona again. We are not giving up and will keep trying until we can encourage many of the recovered to donate.” Another group, the Shiv Surya Dhol Tasha Pathak, has managed to get 25 people to donate. “We have played for around 150 mandals and are calling out to everyone for help. It is taking time to reach out and convince recovered patients, but once the gravity of the situation is explained, some are ready. They have to undergo an antibody test before they can donate,” said Ravindra Bodake.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/volunteer-groups-introduce-plasma-premiere-league-to-attract-more-donors-101619355606114.html

I would like to tell doctors to keep in mind that who has to be recommended to hospital,” he said regarding the hospitalisation of those who have tested positive for Covid-19."The balance between Covid care centres run by hospitals and hospitals must coordinate.

Earlier, all public transport vehicles were also directed to carry passengers up to maximum half capacity and ensure every traveller wears face masks, besides imposing night curfew from 7 pm to 5 am till April 30.On the other hand, as a preventive and precautionary measure against the second wave of Covid-19, deputy commissioner, Senapati district, issued an order on Thursday, asking all shops at Senapati town, 60 kilometres north of Imphal, to close down by 2 pm.As per the order, all such shops in the hill town (Senapati) where shopkeepers are seen without masks will be forced to close for three consecutive days. The order also directed that the vehicles driven without people wearing masks will be seized over and above the penal provision.The Manipur government announced the closure of the Ima Keithel, also known as Nupi Keithel (women’s market), for ten days since April 21. The women’s market was reopened only on February 15 this year after it was shut for nearly 11 months amid the Covid-19 outbreak.On Saturday, Manipur reported 130 new Covid-19 positive cases, breaching the highest single-day spike this year again. With this, the state’s total infection tally jumps to 30,281 besides increasing the total number of active cases to 705, officials said. Even though 29,193 patients (including 13 on Saturday) have recovered so far, the recovery rate has been reduced to 96.40% in the state, sources said. The cumulative number of Covid-19 deaths stands at 383.As of Saturday, 6,59,403 people were screened at the entry points of the state while 6,02,832 were tested for Covid-19 across various testing centres in the state.So far, a total of 1,23,720 people, including healthcare workers and frontline workers, in Manipur have received the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. On the other hand, 62,146 healthcare workers and frontline workers have received their second shot of vaccine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/manipur-markets-shops-allowed-to-open-on-rotation-basis-to-tackle-covid-19-surge-101619348346359.html
25-04-2021||Pune||Maharashtra govt to float tendre to procure Covid vaccine, Remdesivir from international market: Ajit Pawar||Maharashtra has formed a five-member committee which has been tasked to draft a tender to purchase vaccines from global vaccine makers, a week after the Centre announced that all adults will be eligible for a coronavirus vaccine and doses can be sold via the market from May 1.The committee, which will be headed by chief secretary Sitaram Kunte, will facilitate the process of purchasing vaccines as well as drugs like remedesivir, an anti-viral drug that is part of the Covid-19 treatment protocol, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar said on Saturday.“The state cabinet has empowered a committee to take all the decisions about purchase of both remdesivir drug and the Covid vaccine,” Pawar said following a review of Covid situation in Pune on Saturday.Additional chief secretary of finance department Manoj Saunik, principal secretary of public health Dr Pradeep Vyas, secretary of medical education department Saurabh Vijay and principal secretary of industries department Baldev Singh will be part of the committee.The state government is expected to float the global bid by early next week by taking state cabinet’s nod for the expenditure. “The base rate, quantity of vaccines and the Remdesivir desired, expected turn around period will be finalised soon. The bidding will be for all vaccines currently available in international market as well as two available in India. The imported stock of the vaccines is however unlikely to be available before the launch on May 1,” said an official from the public health department. On April 20, following a state cabinet meeting it was decided that Maharashtra will use its development funds to procure vaccines, including those that need to be imported as “ready to use”.“We currently have two vaccines, Covishield and Covaxin, but if the need arises, we have also decided to import stock of other vaccines such as Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, and Sputnik from other countries. There will be no dearth of the money for the vaccine, as we have decided to use the development funds to procure vaccine stock,” state health minister Rajesh Tope had said after the meeting.On Wednesday, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray had held an online meeting with Serum Institute of India’s Adar Poonawalla on Wednesday, where he was told that the company’s production of Covishield has been booked till May 24, Tope said.In light of that, the state will start negotiations with manufacturers of imported vaccines as it will not be able to purchase stock from Serum Institute of India, which makes Covidshield, till third week of May, and Bharat Biotech, which makes Covaxin, as it has not released its prices, Tope added.“A plan is being worked out… since foreign import is now allowed and there is Bharat Biotech, we will get in touch with them. The vaccination drive for [age] 18 to 44 will start on May 1, but the stock is expected to be limited. In that age group, there are roughly 55 or 57.5 million people. So, we will require about 120 million doses, including the wastage, over a span of four to five months, depending on how soon we get the stock,” Kunte had said last week.According to a statement issued by the Press Information Bureau on April 19, adults under the age of 45 would be able to receive vaccines once private sales begin or if state governments procure stocks for distribution to these age groups.In the third phase of the vaccination strategy, the government will make pricing, procurement, eligibility, and administration open and flexible. Vaccine makers will be able to sell half of what they produce at a price of their choosing to the open market and to state governments. The remainder will need to be supplied to Centre for the state-sponsored component of the vaccination programme, which remains limited to the 45-and-over age group only.If the vaccines have been imported as ready-to-use, the government will allow all of the stocks to be sold on the open market or to the states. The pricing for any doses sold in the open market will need to be “transparent”, although the government’s release did not indicate a cap.On April 21, SII announced the price of its Covishield vaccine in the open market. While one dose of this two-dose vaccine will cost ₹600 for private facilities, it will cost ₹400 for the state governments. It also provided a price comparison with other vaccines available in the open market, where the “Russian vaccine” and “Chinese vaccine” costs ₹750, and the “American vaccine” costs ₹1500. The Union health ministry on Saturday issued a clarification saying that the Centre will procure both the vaccines at ₹150 only. And those doses will be provided free to the states.US pharma major Pfizer is in talks with the Centre to deploy its jab for India’s Covid-19 immunisation programme and said that it had offered a not-for-profit price for its vaccine to the government.Pawar said on Saturday that Maharashtra wanted to begin vaccination for all adults from May 1 which is also Maharashtra Day and Labour Day. “In addition to Serum Institute of India’s Covishield vaccine, the other approved vaccines including US made Pfizer or Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin and other vaccines will be included in the tender. Also for remdesivir which is currently under acute shortage will also be procured through a global tender,” Pawar said. Sputnik V made by Russia’s Gamaleya Institute, was approved formally on April 13 and its initial doses are expected to be imported. On Monday, pharma giant Johnson & Johnson applied to India’s drug regulator seeking permission to conduct Phase-3 clinical trial of its single-dose Covid-19 vaccine in India as well as for an import license.Highlighting the increasing demand of liquid oxygen Pawar said that Maharashtra’s quota from Jamnagar plant has been reduced to 125 Metric Tonnes (MT) from 250 (MT) by the Centre. “On Saturday I got to know that this quota has been reduced. I request not to reduce our quota from that plant. Empty oxygen tankers are being airlifted to fast track the oxygen supply. They can come back by road or on train,” Pawar said.“Some plants which were shut down in the past are being reactivated. Sugar factories have been asked if liquid oxygen can be generated from there. For Pune, 30 oxygen plants are proposed and will be installed,” Pawar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/maharashtra-govt-to-float-tendre-to-procure-covid-vaccine-remdesivir-from-international-market-ajit-pawar-101619347566235.html
25-04-2021||Pune||Curtain Call: Theatre of the future, and reality||I was recently asked about “Theatre of the future” in an interview. The pandemic has changed many definitions about what was earlier considered “normal” and watching live online performances is a part of it. In the past year, theatre lovers must have attended at least one such show. I suppose this is what the interviewer was expecting when she posed the query. But I do believe that with the technology currently available, online performances are a compromise. More of a placeholder for the real thing. I feel that in the next few years, after this pandemic is over, we will see an increase in plays in the genre of immersive theatre. Immersive theatre blurs the lines between the audience and the performers. They are usually performed at unconventional venues unlike traditional auditoriums, such as hotels, run-down mills, warehouses, and the like. The concept of “fourth wall” (the imaginary wall between the audience and performers, which is an integral part of most plays) is destroyed completely. In fact, in most of these plays, the audience becomes an active part of the performance! A friend of mine had watched a performance of “Macbeth”, retitled “Sleep No More”, at a hotel in the UK. What he narrated seemed fascinating! The opening of the play was presented at the entrance. After that they could choose the floor they wanted to visit. Each floor had a different part of the play being performed. The audience could choose to leave that scene midway and go and watch another scene. Or they could stay and follow the journey of a character. They could walk with the character and witness her or him meeting other characters and perform different scenes. In the end, all characters converged on a floor where the climax was played out. I too had watched a play when I visited the UK around three years back. It was a spin-off of “Murder on the Orient Express” by Agatha Christie. I was extremely excited to watch it! The set was built in a run-down warehouse in London. While the production design was wonderful and the audience was made to feel like passengers on the train, complete with real dinner and wine, and was also made to participate in the investigation, the performances were strictly ok. So was the overall approach towards the script. While it was a new theatre watching experience for me, the impact was less than impressive. But I cannot judge the entire genre based on a lone performance of a play. Some plays do not even follow this traditional approach of introduction, conflict, resolution of storytelling. They rely more on the experience of the performance at that moment. And that choice is made by the audience! So, there is a possibility that a part of the audience might not watch the climax of the play, they might decide to follow a character who might be inconsequential to the story of the play but is someone they relate to more. The outcome of the play is different for every audience member and it depends solely on the choices that they have made! The linearity of story is not very important in such performances. We have seen variations of this genre in other mediums as well. Video and computer games have followed this interactive genre since a long time. The outcome of many such games depends on how the player plays and the options he chooses. There isn’t a specific “end” to the story that we as an audience have been conditioned to. Even the eerily predictive show “Black Mirror” experimented with this format in the latest episode of theirs titled “Bandersnatch”. The audience had to choose the decisions the protagonist made and the outcome of the show depended on that. There were nearly nine outcomes that I experienced. I am sure there might be more. Films are also gradually experimenting with virtually reality. I had attended a demonstration for the same and it is very similar to immersive theatre, wherein the audience could choose where to look at during a scene and decide to follow a particular character. These experiments are being conducted in India as well, but not in a large number. But after the pandemic is over, my guess is that the number of venues for such experiments will increase as most people will be working from home. People will also be open to watching more abstract content as the reality we are currently living in is nothing less than bizarre!||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/curtain-call-theatre-of-the-future-and-reality-101619347266702.html
25-04-2021||Pune||Through Sara’s eyes: Musings of a 10-year-old schoolgirl||PUNE My parents are wicked. They named my Didi, “Laxmi”, and me…guess what? Saraswati! And do you even know what our surname is? Mochemadkar. I mean, does that make any sense to you? That’s why I have decided that I’m not going to call my mom “ma” and my dad “papa”. I have thought of some secret names for them.” (sic) The musings of a 10-year-old schoolgirl Saraswati, who strongly prefers being called Sara, make for the subject matter of actor Vibhawari Deshpande’s soon-to-be-launched “Sara Chi Diary”. The volume, most of which is in Marathi, is a compilation of 45-odd diary entries of Sara, who has a take on almost everything. Though actor and playwright Deshpande is seasoned as a creator of plays, “Sara Chi Diary” will mark her debut as an author. “The book is a collection of selected pieces, part of my column for one of the city’s weeklies. Through this column, Sara came to life. And she started penning reflections of the world as she saw it,” said Vibhawari, adding that the column’s popularity gave her the courage and encouragement to create “Sara Chi Diary”. “Of course, the book is more nuanced, has more characters and greater flow,” she said. Almost a year-and-a-half back, Deshpande discussed the book’s concept with Devayani Abhyankar, director of a local publication house Continental Prakashan. And “Sara Chi Diary”, almost spontaneously, found its way forward. Sara, as Deshpande imagines her to be, hails from an urban, upwardly mobile, liberal family that allows her to realise her individuality and express opinions. Nonetheless, in her most natural element, Sara feels more like an “underdog,” especially in the presence of her prodigious and pretty-looking elder sister. Her emotional conflicts, complaints, curiosities, states of funk, and moments of joy: the diary is filled with her thoughts aplenty. To add an element of cheer and colour to the diary, Deshpande joined forces with city-based visual storyteller Sayali Bhagali-Damle. “Every diary entry has an illustration, and children, as well as adults, find them engaging,” she said. The diary notes are honest and unfiltered. According to Sara, her mother is absolutely sweet, and so she has named her “Marmalade”, while her father is a photographer at heart (trapped in a mundane corporate job), which is why she addresses him as “Paparazzi”. The anecdotes in the diary do not just surround Sara’s immediate family, they also involve her comments on what she sees around, news, and people she meets, and so on. One of the pages in the diary speaks about how she gives away an expensive, imported drawing kit to an underprivileged girl, daughter of a construction worker, who lives near her house. They become friends and later Sara discovers how gifted the girl is at art. “Such incidents are common with children. They are far more sentient than we usually imagine them to be, and we sometimes tend to oversimplify their emotional insights. Their interpretation of information around them that they process daily may be naive, but it is worth acknowledging,” said Deshpande. The Covid pandemic delayed the publication of the book. “Once the lockdown is called off, and life gets back to normal, the book launch will be planned,” said Vibhawari, adding that in the present times, everyone needs a dose of positivity and everyday humour, which she believes the book offers generously.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/through-sara-s-eyes-musings-of-a-10-year-old-schoolgirl-101619346905599.html
25-04-2021||Other||No trace of third abducted ONGC employee||While two of his colleagues were rescued by security forces from Nagaland on Saturday, there’s no trace yet of Ritul Saikia, the third Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) employee abducted by the United Liberation Front of Asom-Independent (ULFA-I) from Sivasagar in Assam on Wednesday, officials said.“I am not aware of the status of the third ONGC employee. I have been told that efforts are still underway to rescue him and security forces are looking for him. The other two who were rescued in Nagaland have returned to Assam,” Sivasagar superintendent of police, Amitabh Sinha, said. Amid efforts to rescue him, the banned outfit issued a statement on Saturday that the three abducted ONGC employees had been released by ULFA-I and said Saikia could have been killed by army bullets or kept hidden somewhere by the government agencies. The three employees, Ritul Saikia, Mohini Mohan Gogoi (both junior engineer assistants) and Alakesh Saikia (junior technician), all from Assam, were abducted from a workover rig site of ONGC inside the Lakwa tea estate. According to the police, five armed persons came to the rig site in an ONGC ambulance and abducted the three employees at gunpoint. The ambulance was recovered later close to the Assam-Nagaland border, around 11 kilometres away, leading to suspicion that the abducted persons could be in Nagaland. On Saturday, Alakesh Saikia and Mohini Mohan Gogou were rescued from near the India-Myanmar border in Mon district of Nagaland. The operation was carried out jointly by personnel from the Indian Army, the Assam Rifles and Nagaland Police with help of inputs provided by Assam Police. “On Friday night, nearly 500 security personnel from Indian Army, Assam Rifles and Nagaland Police tried to rescue the three ONGC employees we had taken into custody on April 20. As a result, an encounter took place between both sides from nearly 10 pm to 2.30 am,” said the ULFA-I statement released on Saturday. The statement added that keeping safety of the three employees in mind, ULFA-I cadres released them at Tokko Singkhu village of Mon in Nagaland in a healthy condition and proceeded to their destination. It alleged that though the security forces were aware of it, they resorted to firing at the spot moments after ULFA-I cadres left the area. “News reports say that two officials, Mohini Mohan Gogoi and Alakesh Saikia, were rescued from the village by Nagaland Police. But Indian Army has not released any information on Ritul Saikia. That’s why we suspect that Ritul Sakia may have been killed in firing by the Indian Army or army-police may have kept him hidden,” the ULFA-I statement read.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/no-trace-of-third-abducted-ongc-employee-101619346786919.html
25-04-2021||Bangalore||Day-2 of weekend curfew in Karnataka: People by and large remain at home||With Karnataka observing the second day of the weekend curfew aimed against Covid-19, Bengaluru and most other parts of the State wore a deserted look on Sunday. Businesses and restaurants remained shut, and vehicles stayed off roads. From 6 AM to 10 AM, the administration allowed people to purchase essential items like milk, grocery and vegetables barring which people largely stayed indoors. To restrict unnecessary public movement, certain flyovers and streets were barricaded. After 10 AM, the police started enforcing the restrictions and were seen questioning people still on roads. While those with genuine reasons were let off, the others loitering around were punished and vehicles were seized. There were similar reports from other parts of the State. Home Minister Basavaraj Bommai said people voluntarily have restricted movement and this would help in Covid management. Speaking to reporters here, he said Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa spoke to Deputy Commissioners of the districts on Saturday and gathered information from them. According to Covid-19 guidelines in place from April 21 to May 4, night curfew has been imposed in the entire State from 9 PM to 6 AM every day; there would be weekend curfew from 9 PM on Friday to 6 AM on Monday. Amid reports of lockdown-like measures that are in place during weekends may be extended to other days of the week, Bommai said, "Such proposals did not come up during the meeting on Saturday, so I don't want to comment. For now, things will continue as they are." The government had on Saturday hinted at lockdown-like measures through the week, with a couple of Ministers and the Chief Secretary indicating about it while stating that the State Cabinet is likely to discuss and take a call at its meeting on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/day2-of-weekend-curfew-in-karnataka-people-by-and-large-remain-at-home-101619345241759.html

25-04-2021||Delhi||Tears, prayers, police, JCB: How Delhi's Saroj Hospital saved over 100 lives||On a gloomy Saturday afternoon, the staff at the Saroj Super Specialty Hospital in Delhi broke down and started praying anxiously as lives of more 100 patients hung by a thread amid rapidly depleting oxygen supply.An oxygen tanker had reached the hospital after the staff spent hours running around in search of supplies and making frantic calls to the government and police.But it could not enter the area where the hospital's oxygen tank is. The problem: its larger-than-normal size. The solution: an excavator, which broke down a portion of a wall.The hospital ran out of oxygen in the afternoon and the supply from the vendor never came.The situation was tense amid fears of a repeat of the tragedy at the Jaipur Golden Hospital, where 20 patients died due to lack of oxygen."We really didn't know what to," Pankaj Chawla, the owner of the hospital, said."This was the time we started discharging patients. We told families that we don't have oxygen and they can take their patients to some other healthcare facilities," Chawla said.The hospital, run by a trust, discharged 34 patients during this time. Since the rest were on ventilators, their families were asked to arrange oxygen cylinders."Most of the patients said, 'we will stay... it's the same situation everywhere. Let's see what happens'. Thirty-four were medically okay to go," Chawla said.The hospital went to the high court to get an order for urgent relief, but help still did not come immediately. It borrowed oxygen cylinders from various healthcare facilities, while some Delhi government officials worked in the background.Later, the city government allotted a tanker to it on a sharing basis."The tanker came to the hospital, but it was so big that it couldn't get into the area where our LMO (liquid medical oxygen) tank is," Chawla said. "We started breaking down a wall and a ramp with electronic hammers and whatever we had, but it was taking time and the tanker had to go to the Tirath Ram Shah Hospital."Government officials told the hospital that the tanker would come back after an hour."That is the time everybody thought nothing can save us. All of us, my doctors, my staff started crying. We were running out of luck, too," Chawla recalled.The hospital staff and some police personnel rushed to get some cylinders filled.Twenty cylinders were brought to the hospital in a Delhi Transport Corporation bus. Those cylinders lasted 40 minutes and actually saved the day, he said."In the meanwhile, we called the mayor, fire department... brought in a JCB (excavator), which broke a portion of the wall and the ramp," Chawla said.The police brought the tanker back after delivering oxygen at the Tirath Ram Shah Hospital.At present, there are over 100 patients at the hospital, majority of them on oxygen support."It could've been another Jaipur Golden tragedy, perhaps, of a bigger size... All this time, the families were there, helping us," Chawla said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/tears-prayers-police-jcb-how-delhi-s-saroj-hospital-saved-over-100-lives-101619338499183.html
25-04-2021||Delhi||Connecting people one plasma donor at a time||While you may recognize him as the digital content creator who leaves you in splits with his viral memes and reels, 29 year old RJ Abhinav has also been driving home smiles by being a plasma enabler, connecting eligible plasma donors with recipients through the power of his social media. The Delhi boy has been attempting to put together a data base of plasma donors to help critical patients in need. Abhinav’s insta handle is full of videos, stories and post about plasma donation, busting myths and creating awareness. “Plasma donors in Delhi are very less, nobody is coming forward. Everyone is scared. Jinko Covid hokar theek ho gya hai they are scared to come out because of the fear of getting infected again. However, they should understand that they can take precautions and donate plasma. Something is bigger than their fear and that is - the value of the life, that they can save through donating their plasma. There are so many plasma requests but they aren’t able to find the right donors. That’s why I am asking people to send me details. Even if I get one or two donors, I can help those who are in urgent need. I am also a part of a group that includes social media influencers and people who are active on social media, and we share details and maintain an excel sheet of plasma donors.” Project Plasma is a Fever Network initiative to celebrate the super power of Covid recovered plasma donors, who are stepping forward amid the second wave of Covid, to donate their plasma to save lives of other infected patients.The power to save someone’s life is truly a superpower. Encouraging the youth to step forward without hesitation Abhinav says, “Millennials enjoy watching Superhero movies because they admire the power of these superheroes saving other people’s lives. Donating plasma if you have antibodies against Coronavirus is your superpower to save someone’s life. You get to be the superhero / heroine of the patient’s life!” Abhinav, a plasma hero trying to bridge the gap between plasma donors and recipients has been collating and sharing the data of plasma requests and donation with a group of like minded troopers, while protecting the privacy of donors. “There are people from different states and we are trying our best. We don’t broadcast the number of donors anywhere. Because once you put up the number, that guy or girl who wants to donate receives calls from all over the places. I request people to message in my inbox. When there is any need, we match the donor and help them. I don’t have the exact number of people I have helped since everyone who is a part of the group is updating the list and using it to help others, I presume, the number must be between 20 to 30,” says Abhinav. There are people who can donate plasma but the panic about visiting the hospital and donating plasma is stopping them. “Fear is genuine. But if you face antibodies, there is least chance you will get Covid again till the degree that it will harm you. You have an advantage of having those antibodies over others who are struggling with their lives. There are people who need you. Hospitals are making sure that you donate in an environment which is free from people and much safer. Take all the precautions, a slight risk and convince yourself. A doctor calls for a plasma donation when they don’t find any other alternative. When somebody is calling for plasma, the condition is critical. You have antibodies, you have defeated and koi aur nahi kar pa rha hai so why not help him or her,” asks Abhinav.You are a superhero if you have recovered from Covid 19 because you have the power to save a life!

There are around 50 patients in the hospital and most of them are on oxygen support.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageLNJP Hospital's Medical Director Dr Suresh Kumar said, "We had exhausted our oxygen stock and were using the backup which would have lasted for two hours only."AAP MLA Raghav Chaddha, who is also the chairman of LNJP Hospital's Rogi Kalyan Samiti, had earlier tweeted about the cryogenic tanker on its way to refill oxygen stock in the hospital."Within the next 30 minutes, LNJP will receive liquid oxygen supply via cryogenic tanker. The tanker is on its way," he tweeted around 9.55 am on Sunday.Chaddha had also helped Sir Ganga Ram Hospital get one metric tonne of oxygen around 12.20 am. The hospital has also received five metric tonnes of oxygen in the early hours of Sunday.The Delhi High Court on Saturday asked the Centre and the Delhi government to coordinate on the issue of making medical oxygen available to hospitals treating COVID-19 patients, observing that citizens cannot be left to die.The court also made it clear that the efforts which Delhi government has to make in this regard cannot be trivialised and they should not leave it entirely to the central government.While some hospitals have managed to make short-term arrangements, there is no immediate end to the crisis in sight. Metro Hospital, in Gurgaon's Palam Vihar, which claims to be in its "last leg of medical oxygen", had made an urgent appeal for help to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Home Minister Amit Shah and other ministers."INOX commitment to replenish liquid medical oxygen remain unfulfilled . Only 1.5 hours to go. Please help us urgently," the hospital tweeted around 10.41 am tagging the Prime Minister Office, PM Modi, Home Minister Amit Shah, Haryana chief minister Mahonar Lal Khattar, Railway Minister PiyushGoyal, Haryana Health Minister Anil Vij among others.Delhi recorded the highest single-day rise in its COVID-19 deaths with 357 more people succumbing to the viral disease on Saturday as well as over 24,000 fresh cases.

The chief minister, who held a high-level meeting in the wake of a shortage of doctors for the treatment of Covid-19 and other patients, asked the officials to ensure that vacant posts are immediately filled.As per people aware of the development, there are 4,133 ANM vacancies against sanctioned posts of 9,130 in Bihar while there is a shortage of 2,000-odd medical members against 4,000 sanctioned posts.With Covid-19 cases increasing day by day, the state is feeling the need for doctors as more than 500 doctors and health workers of the two leading hospitals in Patna - AIIMS and Patna Medical College and Hospital (PMCH) - have been infected with Covid-19 during the ongoing second wave, according to agency reports. Altogether, 384 employees of AIIMS Patna, including doctors, nurses, sanitation workers, have been infected during the second wave so far, medical superintendent CM Singh told a news agency.“The situation is the same in medical colleges which are functioning on half the teaching strength. Of the 4,000 teaching posts, nearly 50% are vacant,” said Dr Ajay Kumar, senior vice-president of the Indian Medical Association, Bihar.The IMA, Bihar chapter, wrote a letter to the chief minister on Friday asking him to appoint doctors as an emergency measure. “There is a provision of quick appointment of doctors and others in epidemic time. All such people who are ready to join can be recruited on contract on different posts by appointments under epidemic provisions removing all obstacles,” said Dr Kumar.“This war needs a big army of doctors, paramedics, nurses and support staff more than what we need in normal times. Situation if not corrected can be disastrous,” the IMA said in the letter.Dr Kumar said that doctors and health care workers (HCWs) are continuously working for the last 14 months without any leave. “They are exhausted and need some rest on intervals. More than 15% of them are infected. Many have died. It is the demand of time in the public interest,” said Kumar.The state reported 77 deaths in the last 24 hours while the active cases climbed to 81,960. “Seven districts, including Patna, Gaya, Bhagalpur, Aurangabad, Saran, Nalanda and Begusarai, reported more than 500 positive cases on Friday,” said Manoj Kumar, executive director, State Health Society.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/fill-vacant-doctors-post-soon-bihar-cm-directs-officials-as-covid-19-cases-rise-101619334485709.html
25-04-2021||Delhi||Covid-19 and crematorium: Delhi's slum dwellers grapple with smoke, stench, and fear of disease||The smoke hangs in an ash grey cloud over their homes and the acrid smell from more than 200 cremations a day doesn’t leave, they say, permeating as it were their very pores. For the residents of Shaheed Bhagat Singh Camp, living next to a crematorium is as much a struggle as keeping Covid-19 at bay.Being in such close proximity to a crematorium is never easy, say the residents of the slum colony in west Delhi. But when the number of bodies being burnt goes up from about three to four a day to about 200-250, it’s about visitations of death and also the fear of the contagion looming large over every aspect of their lives.They wake up to the smell of burning bodies and sleep to it at night, said Saroj, one of the 1,500 odd people living in the 900 shanties in the slum colony located just a few metres away from the Paschim Puri crematorium."It is a very scary situation. We keep seeing ambulances pass by and constantly there is smell and smoke, whether it is day or night,” the 38-year-old ragpicker told PTI.The fear of contracting Covid-19 is constant and the glowing fires from the crematorium that now operates 24X7 allows neither peace of mind nor sleep, she said.On the night of April 14, a fire broke out in the slum cluster and Saroj and scores of her neighbours are still recovering from that. There were no casualties but 30 shanties were burnt.Half of Saroj's house also got burnt in the fire. And just as she was recovering came the weeklong lockdown aimed at breaking the chain of Covid-19 transmission.Though there are no official figures, Saroj’s neighbour, 35-year-old Kakoli Devi, said about 300 bodies were cremated on Thursday. In the last two days, about 200-250 bodies were cremated. "We have arranged for a truck and we will leave this place for our village in Maharajganj (in Uttar Pradesh). At least we will be spared this constant looming feeling of death," Kakoli said."Everyone is holed up inside the house. We don’t even switch the fans on because we fear we will get corona through the air. The atmosphere has been particularly traumatic for children," said the widow with three children. Many others, mostly from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, are also planning to leave for their villages. Several people had left earlier as the second wave of Covid-19 gathered pace and those that are left fear their homes won’t be livable for much longer given the continuous smell and stench. Many residents said it was not so bad earlier because the cremations took place at the far end of the crematorium. Now with the numbers going up – Delhi on Saturday recorded 357 deaths, its highest yet, and over 24,000 fresh cases – the entire area is being used. When the residents protested, officials, they said, told them they have government orders to do so.Saroj, who lives with seven family members, including three children, is also planning to go back to her village in Uttar Pradesh. With the cases rising, she has lost her job as a ragpicker."Some days we just drink water, some days we get food through NGOs. The situation is terrible." The stigma of living adjacent to a crematorium has also led to some people losing their jobs as domestic workers in the upscale Paschim Vihar colony near by.A 16-year-old girl, who worked as a part-time domestic help, said her employers asked her not to come to work because her house is close to a ‘shamshan ghat’."They fear we will carry corona with us so we are thinking of returning to our village. But even that costs money. We will need ₹2,000-2,500. How can we afford it?” she asked.Another 12-year-old said some have the option of returning to their villages but he doesn’t have any place to go. This is where his family has lived for decades."Where do we go? if we leave, what will we earn? Already our earnings have drastically reduced in this corona pandemic," said the young boy who does part-time domestic chores in Paschim Vihar.Vijay Kumar, a social worker at child rights NGO CHETNA, said many children are into substance abuse and are being roped in by crematorium workers to help in carrying the bodies."They are not given any protective gear and are being tempted with money - the more the number of bodies they carry, the more they money. It is very risky for them," he said.Sanjay Gupta, director of CHETNA (Childhood Enhancement Through Training and Action), is worried about the long-term impact.Children, already living in tough lives, are seeing corpses of Covid patients being burnt day and night in front of them. “This will leave a deep impression on their mental well-being and thinking,” he said.With this fear, the children are ready for migration along with their whole family as the people of the community are also involved in this cremation process which can be an active source of spreading corona,” Gupta added.He said it is time for people to come forward and help children. Instead of cremating corpses inside cities, the government should make arrangements somewhere outside, maybe in border areas, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/covid19-and-crematorium-delhi-s-slum-dwellers-grapple-with-smoke-stench-and-fear-of-disease-101619332324285.html
25-04-2021||Patna||Bihar transporters rue their fate over business contractions, seek relief from govt||A year after the nationwide lockdown to curb the spread of Covid-19, transporters in Bihar are ruing their fate owing to declining passenger footfalls and contraction in business due to restrictions imposed on public transport and night curfew in the ongoing second wave of Covid-19 across the country.“Only 10,000 buses are plying across the state as well inter-state routes as against the strength of 60,000 buses. The footfall of passengers has declined drastically in the last week owing to the rise in Covid cases. Transporters are now facing economic hardships again,” said president of the Bihar Motor Transport Federation (BMTF) Uday Shankar Singh. The BMTF is an apex body of transporters in Bihar.Singh said transporters who have a big fleet of buses have curtailed plying their buses by almost half in different routes, be it Patna-Muzaffarpur, Patna-Darbhanga, Purnea and neighbouring states of Jharkhand and West Bengal.“Last year, we faced nationwide lockdown when our business came to a halt. Things started improving a bit from October but now again we are facing the same ordeal. There is not even enough money to complete two trips in a day as the number of passengers has declined. There are also restrictions on seating while recurring costs of insurance, road tax, wages to staff have to be given. What to do?” said Mukesh Sharma, another transporter who is only running 12 buses now out of 25 buses he owns.“The Mithapur bus stand is almost deserted now. Only a few buses could be seen,” he added.Truck operators are the worst hit. “The surge in Covid cases has now forced truckers to shut their business. Labourers have left for their villages fearing getting infected while business orders mainly ferrying goods and other articles have reduced drastically over the week. Almost 25% of the total trucks operational in the state have gone off the road. More are likely to shut their operations because of lack of manpower, especially drivers and labourers to offload the goods,” rued Bhanu Shekhar Singh, president of Bihar state truck owners association.He said there are 5 lakh trucks in the state of which 50% were hit hard by the government’s restrictions on 12-14 wheels trucks to ferry stone chips and sand while the rest are now hit by the fall in business due to the Covid-19 surge.Giving another insight into the poor business in truck operations, Purshottam, an operator, said the government must give relaxations to the truckers to ferry stone chips and sand else this sector would not be able to sustain for long due to economic non-viability if the pandemic persists. “From where will we give road tax and insurance and loan repayment? It is totally unviable now to run trucks,” he added.The transporters, especially bus owners, are upset with the state government for not putting curbs on the operationalisation of buses coming from New Delhi and Uttar Pradesh. “At a time when inter-district traffic of passengers have fallen, buses from New Delhi and UP are coming with ease ferrying migrant labourers mostly. The majority of these buses have no permits and easily get through borders in connivance with local transport officials. Why are these buses not stopped at the borders where migrants could be tested and asked to use local transport to go home?” said another transporter, wishing not to be quoted.DemandsIn wake of the decline in business in the transport sector, the BMTF has demanded the state government should immediately give relief to the bus and truck operators by suspending road tax payment for at least two months as it did last year when there was a nationwide lockdown.“We want that transport department should suspend road tax from bus and truckers for two months effective from April 2021. I will be writing to the transport department soon,” said BMTF president. Another BMTF member said transporters this time would look for legal options to seek relief if the state government does not suspend road tax and other charges.Many transporters also felt the state government was shying from imposing full lockdown apparently to deny various sectors including transport to seek relief.“What is the point of night curfew and restrictions on seat limit when passengers and business are almost negligible. A full lockdown is a must. That way we will have a claim on seeking relief,” said another transporter, seeking anonymity.Transport secretary Sanjay Kumar Agarwal could not be reached for comments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-transporters-rue-their-fate-over-business-contractions-seek-relief-from-govt-101619326385405.html

Moreover, we have also kept an oxygen tank on standby in case of emergency,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/patiala-gmc-awaits-centre-s-nod-to-import-oxygen-plant-from-germany-101619299562864.html
25-04-2021||Chandigarh||Lawyers oppose HC bar council’s move to appoint ex-IG Kunwar Vijay as panel member||A section of lawyers on Saturday opposed the Punjab and Haryana Bar Council’s decision to appoint former inspector general of police (IGP) Kunwar Vijay Pratap Singh as member of its disciplinary committee. It was on Friday that a high court bench had questioned Kunwar Vijay’s role as Punjab Police’s special investigation team (SIT) member in the 2015 Kotkapura police firing case probe. “Seeing this conduct of the respondent (Kunwar Vijay), one may harbour an idea that he may be indulging in theatrics to fulfil his own post-retirement political ambitions as several officers have done after demitting office,” the bench of Justice Rajbir Sehrawat had observed. The judgment came on the day when the bar council led by chairman Minderjeet Yadav held a ceremony in which the former IPS officer was handed over his licence to practise as an advocate besides making him a member of the disciplinary committee. The disciplinary committee of the bar council, which has more than 1 lakh members from Punjab, Haryana and Chandigarh, investigates complaints against lawyers in the two states and the UT. “The move is in total violation of section 9 of the Advocates Act, 1961, and transparency. It is requested that the decision be reconsidered immediately keeping in view the high traditions of the council,” Baltej Singh Sidhu, former secretary of the Punjab and Haryana High Court Bar Association said in a letter to the council. Sidhu said he personally held nothing against the former IPS officer. “Kunwar Vijay does not know how lawyers work. As per rules, a member of the committee has to have 10-year experience,” he said.Kunwar Vijay, who did his bachelor’s in laws (LLB) from Panjab University in 2010, approached the council to grant him licence after his resignation in the aftermath of a high court judgment of April 9 in which SIT probe reports were set aside in the Kotkapura firing case and the Punjab government was told to constitute new SIT excluding him as member. Bar council chairman Yadav said a meeting was called on Monday to reconsider the decision in view of complaints that Kunwar Vijay does not fulfill criteria as a disciplinary committee member.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/lawyers-oppose-hc-bar-council-s-move-to-appoint-ex-ig-kunwar-vijay-as-panel-member-101619299082698.html

The HC had ordered a preliminary CBI probe acting on the report of a judicial officer after he found that collection of royalty from trucks laden with mining material was going on. Subsequently, Punjab had sought recalling of the order and submitted that FIRs have been registered and measures are being put in place to check illegal mining. It had also requested the court to allow the state to probe these FIRs and recall order on the CBI probe.The high court has now disposed of the plea, but directed the state to conduct a probe into three FIRs and also take action against the officials if found guilty in departmental probes. It has also asked Punjab to apprise the court by August about its proposal to bring in amendments in the mining regulation law as well as other measures for receiving and redressal of complaints pertaining to illegal mining.“We find that measures proposed by the state government are sufficient and effective in dealing with illegal nakas for collecting gunda tax,” the court said in its judgment to the proposal of the government that district-level task force would be set up and online complaint redressal system would be put in place.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hc-gives-punjab-6-months-to-devise-mechanism-to-check-illegal-mining-101619295182370.html

Bajwa said the investigation should preferably be concluded within a month, and subsequently after filing of challan, an application should be filed before the trial court requesting for an expeditious trial preferably on day-to-day basis. “I had suggested this earlier as well. The high court has also made similar observations by directing that the investigation of these FIRs should be concluded as expeditiously as possible, preferably within six months from the date of constitution of SIT,” he said in a statement here. The Rajya Sabha MP said it has also been stated in the judgment that justice needs to be delivered to the victims who have been waiting endlessly. He said the Congress was voted to power by the people of Punjab based on its poll promise to punish the perpetrators of these sacrilege cases. “Hence, they should not be made to wait for justice by the government and expeditious investigation is the need of the hour,” he added. The Congress leader said that without commenting on the investigation that has been conducted and focusing on the time frame within which a party has to fulfil its poll promises regarding these cases, the high court judgment, instead of being challenged, should be implemented in letter and spirit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/constitute-new-sit-to-probe-kotkapura-firing-case-bajwa-101619294582232.html

The demand for oxygen currently stands at 250 metric tonnes per day and is further expected to go up to 300 MT in coming days on account of spiralling Covid cases.The CM also asked for a feasibility report from the power department on use of thermal plants for providing oxygen for medical use.Reacting to reports of increase in the price of oxygen by suppliers, Amarinder asked the Punjab Small Industries and Export Corporation to discuss, negotiate and settle the pricing with bulk suppliers and inform principal secretary, medical education and research, on the final decision.The CM also ordered Punjab Health Systems Corporation to procure 100 more oxygen concentrators, including 50 approved earlier, in addition to 234 already being used in Covid facilities.Principal secretary, industries, has been directed to set up the state control room at Udyog Bhawan, Chandigarh, with support from director, industries and commerce, with other officers, as required, to be provided by the personnel department.

25-04-2021||Delhi||Delhi's Covid-19 cases hit 1 million||An unprecedented spike in Covid-19 cases in Delhi in its fourth wave – the worst so far – pushed the number of total infections in the national capital so far past the one million-mark, with the latest 250,000 cases coming in just 11 days as the city’s health care infrastructure creaked under the massive caseload and hospitals made urgent appeals for life-saving supplies.On Saturday, Delhi reported 24,103 cases and record 357 deaths. The positivity rate – the proportion of tests that are positive for Covid-19 – continued to soar at 32.27%, with nearly one out of every three samples tested across the Capital returning positive.The authorities scrambled to get oxygen tanks to hospitals where Covid-19 patients were gasping amid the world’s worst Covid-19 surge, as many criticised alleged government negligence over the public health crisis spiralling out of control.Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal urged his counterparts in other states to provide oxygen to the national capital, saying all available resources were proving to be inadequate owing to the severity of the latest surge. “I am writing to all CMs requesting them to provide oxygen to Delhi, if they have spare. Though Central govt is also helping us, the severity of corona is such that all available resources are proving inadequate,” Kejriwal tweeted.The first case was reported in Delhi on March 2 last year. It took 419 days for the tally to touch one million. While the first 250,000 cases took 205 days, the second 250,000 cases came in 57 days – Delhi’s tally crossed the half-million mark on November 18, 2020.From there, as the pace of infections came under control, the third phase slowed down considerably – it took 146 days for the tally to cross 750,000.However, pushed by the mammoth surge of infections in recent weeks, it took only 11 days for the latest 250,000 cases.Across the country, 349,158 infections were reported on Saturday. The active cases in the country have crossed the 2.5 million-mark.In Delhi, there are 93,080 active Covid-19 cases, taking the total Covid-19 tally of the city to 1,004,782. The death toll in the national capital mounted to 13,898. The positivity rate in Delhi stood at 32.27% and the case fatality rate was at 1.38%. As many as 74,702 tests, including 42,346 RT-PCR and 32,356 rapid antigen tests were done, according to the official health bulletin.A total of 22,695 people also recovered from the disease, taking the total number of recoveries to 897,804.On Saturday, 20 people died at Delhi’s Jaipur Golden Hospital as the facility waited for oxygen to be replenished.With the worsening of conditions at the hospital, the Centre announced exemption of basic customs duty on import of Covid-19 vaccine, medical-grade oxygen and related equipment to boost domestic availability and directed the customs department to clear all import consignments, including life-saving drugs and equipment used in Covid-19 treatment on priority.The decisions were taken at a meeting chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to boost oxygen availability in the country.“The PM emphasised that there was an immediate need to augment the supply of medical grade oxygen as well as equipment required for patient care both at home and in hospitals. The PM stressed that all ministries and departments need to work in synergy to increase the availability of oxygen and medical supplies,” a statement said.A day after 25 patients died at the Ganga Ram Hospital, one of the city’s biggest and most high-profile health facilities, the Delhi high court asked the Centre about the preparedness to deal with the expected Covid-19 second wave peak in mid-May, terming the mounting cases as a “tsunami”, and also warned it will “hang” any person who tries to obstruct oxygen supplies to hospitals in the Capital.A bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Rekha Palli said this during a special three-hour-long hearing on a holiday on the issue of the escalating oxygen crisis in various hospitals in Delhi. “We will not spare anyone,” the bench said.Dr Jacob John, former head of the department of virology at the Christian Medical College, Vellore, said: “The number of infections is likely to start coming down soon. The high mortality will continue for another week after that. However, the number of new infections coming down is still no good news because the absolute numbers would be high and the health care system is overwhelmed.”(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhis-covid-19-cases-hit-1-million-101619293272284.html
25-04-2021||Delhi||20 die as O2 pressure dips in Rohini hospital||Twenty Covid patients, mostly admitted to the critical care unit of Jaipur Golden hospital in Rohini, died on Friday allegedly due to low oxygen pressure as the hospital struggled with depleting oxygen stock, officials said. Despite this, officials said the hospital received the requisite supply of oxygen only on Saturday, after it raised the alarm twice.“We lost 20 patients almost all of whom were in the critical care unit and on a high flow of oxygen. Our liquid medical oxygen stock was over by about 10pm (on Friday) and then we switched over to the oxygen cylinders attached to the main gas pipeline. There was a drop in pressure and the patients could not survive,” said Dr Deep Baluja, medical director of the hospital.For over 1.5 hours, officials said patients were completely dependent on the backup oxygen cylinders.According to officials, Jaipur Golden hospital was supposed to receive its quota of oxygen at 5.30pm on Friday but got an emergency supply at around midnight after raising alarm. While it received an additional 1,500 cubic metres of oxygen -- 40% of its quota allocated by the government -- later, officials said it was facing a crisis again by morning.“We are again in a crisis situation, 200 lives are on the line. Last night, we were at least able to save most patients. We will not be able to do that today. We have exhausted our backup,” said Dr Baluja.Along with representatives from Maharaja Agrasen, Batra, and Saroj hospitals, Dr Baluja approached the Delhi high court on Saturday to secure supply of oxygen.With oxygen levels depleting, officials said the hospital somehow managed to hold on till 1.30pm on Saturday when they received another 1,000 cubic metres of oxygen. By 7.15 pm Saturday, the hospital again had to tweet an SOS, “Next impending oxygen crises in Jaipur Golden Hospital. Over 200 lives at stake if liquid medical oxygen is not supplied by 9:00 pm tonight.” The hospital said it received another 1,000 cubic metres of oxygen around 9 pm, which it said will last till at least 5 pm on Sunday.The appeal comes a day after Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal flagged the severe oxygen crisis faced by the national capital and “catastrophic” events that may follow if the demand for liquid medical oxygen is not met. Kejriwal said some state governments are stopping tankers meant for Delhi to meet their requirement.“Will people of Delhi not get oxygen if there is no oxygen-producing plant here? Please suggest whom should I speak to in Central government when an oxygen tanker destined for Delhi is stopped in another state?” Kejriwal said during the Covid-review conference with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday.A police officer, who did not want to be identified, said that around 11 pm on Friday, police had received information regarding the deaths of 20 Covid patients due to oxygen shortage at Jaipur Golden Hospital. The police contacted the district administration that was also unaware of the deaths.“Both the agencies contacted the hospital management but it denied that any deaths had taken place because of (lack of) oxygen. However, they flagged the oxygen crisis in the hospital by saying that they only had half an hour stock,” the officer said.“It’s to be probed if the 20 patients died before the oxygen supply was made or after it. As of now, we have not received any complaint from any concerned agency or from the family of any dead patients,” the officer added.Security beefed upMeanwhile, the Delhi Police’s intelligence unit (special branch) alerted the Rohini district police about a potential law and order problem and suggested deployment of adequate security personnel at the hospital. Within minutes, nearly 50 police personnel, led by an assistant commissioner of police (ACP) and inspectors, reached the hospital premises and joined the private security guards to ensure law and order was not disrupted.The police are on high alert to ensure no violence breaks out after several hospitals reported that lives of patients are at stake because of inadequate oxygen supply.A senior police officer said, “Since the hospital management (Jaipur Golden Hospital) declared that 20 patients died on Friday night due to low oxygen pressure which resulted from the hospital running out of its oxygen supply, we anticipated a backlash from the family and relatives of the deceased. Also, after the hospital issued an SOS about the lives of 200 other patients, we reviewed the situation and accordingly deployed police personnel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/20-die-as-o2-pressure-dips-in-rohini-hospital-101619292917720.html
25-04-2021||Delhi||Will hang anyone blocking oxygen supplies, warns HC||The Delhi high court on Saturday asked the Centre and the Delhi government about their preparedness to deal with the peak of the second Covid wave expected by mid-May, terming the mounting cases a “tsunami” and warning that it will “hang any person” who tries to obstruct oxygen supplies to hospitals.Talking tough, a bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Rekha Palli said this during a special three-hour hearing on the escalating crisis in city hospitals on a day when 20 patients died at Delhi’s Jaipur Golden Hospital for lack of oxygen. The bench asked both the Centre and the Delhi government to “interact and co-ordinate” with each other for ensuring adequate supply of oxygen.The Centre called the Delhi government a “cry baby” before the court and said it was the latter’s “incompetence” that led to the deaths of people. Solicitor general Tushar Mehta, representing the Centre, asked the Delhi government to manage the procurement and distribution of oxygen on their own and not depend on the Centre for everything.Mehta said the state governments were responsible for the transportation of the oxygen from various sources and the Delhi government had to do it on its own.“So far we have ensured that nobody in the country was left without oxygen. States and Union territories which do not have industries have also arranged for tanks but the Delhi government has yet not coordinated with the suppliers,” Mehta said.The bench questioned the Delhi government over its citing of the shortage of cryogenic tankers to procure oxygen from Durgapur, Rourkela and Kalinganagar.“We make it clear that the efforts the GNCTD (government of the national capital territory of Delhi) has to make in this regard cannot be trivialised, and they should not leave it entirely to the central government to act in this regard,” the court recorded in its order while directing the Delhi government to arrange tankers and other logistics for timely procurement of oxygen.“Citizens cannot be allowed to die like this… In case cryogenic tanks are less in supply, we are hopeful that the Centre may work this out in coordination with the GNCTD, who cannot leave it completely on the Centre,” it said.Senior advocate Rahul Mehra, appearing for the Delhi government, said the city government did not have enough cryogenic tankers because Delhi is not an industrial state.“We got 309 metric tonnes yesterday as against the 480 MT allocated by the Centre. It’s a chaotic situation with disorderly function. Some incidents are bound to happen. We fear we will lose many people... human lives are being lost every day,” Mehra said.During the proceedings, four city hospitals — including Jaipur Golden, where the tragedy took place a few hours ago — complained that there was nobody to coordinate with them on oxygen and essential medicine supplies.“We have already lost 20 lives. We are literally gasping for breath and pleading. The cases are slipping out of our hand. We are trying to ask every authority but to no avail,” senior advocate Sachin Datta for Jaipur Golden said.The bench expressed concern over this as Mehra informed the court that the Delhi government had constituted a team of officers to coordinate with hospitals. As Mehra said the government was not getting information about the quantity of oxygen supplied from suppliers and re-fillers, the court directed the suppliers and re-fillers to give all such information to the city government.During the hearing, the court also directed the Centre and the Delhi government to submit their plans on preparedness after it cited a report by IIT Kanpur predicting that the peak of cases would be hit in mid-May.Mehta told the court that this was being considered and the country had to be prepared for the worst. He said steps had been taken to streamline the passage of oxygen and a strong message had been given to the suppliers in this regard by the top leadership.The court also suggested providing Delhi Police security to hospitals as patients were being discharged from there due to the lack of oxygen supply.“Let’s face the reality. If admissions aren’t being made, we know how people react. We don’t want a law-and-order situation. If riots break out at hospitals, what will happen? There are deaths taking place,” it said.The matter will now be heard on Monday, April 26.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/will-hang-anyone-blocking-oxygen-supplies-warns-hc-101619292701316.html
25-04-2021||Delhi||Covid-19 lockdown in Delhi may be extended by a week||The Delhi government will extend the lockdown in Delhi by at least one more week, senior government officials said on Saturday.“An order to extend the lockdown will be issued on Sunday by the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA). The decision has been taken owing to the sudden spurt in Covid-19 cases and the high positivity rate which has led to a large number of hospital admissions and an oxygen crisis. In such a situation, if the lockdown is lifted, there could be a serious law and order situation,” said a senior government official privy to the development.On April 19, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal announced a six-day lockdown that is supposed to be in force in Delhi till 5am on April 26 (Monday). This is now likely to be extended by another week, officials said.Residents’ welfare associations (RWAs) and traders’ associations on Saturday demanded an extension of the restrictions, quoting the high number of daily cases being reported in the Capital.“We have been demanding that the lockdown should be imposed for at least 14 days. Delhi is reporting at least 25,000 fresh Covid-19 cases every day even as the number of tests is coming down. There is such a crisis for oxygen, in such a situation one cannot even imagine opening up economic activities,” said Saurabh Gandhi, general secretary United Residents of Delhi (URD) — a joint forum of RWAs.In a statement, the Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) said more than 100 leading associations from across the city have decided to observe “voluntary self-lockdown” of Delhi markets from April 26 to May 2.“Trade leaders of Delhi have opined that opening of markets in the city would be a suicidal step. In case the markets stay open, and if any trader or any other person gets infected with Covid-19, they will not even be able to get the required medical facilities. Over and above it will be an extra load on the government which is already fighting for restoration of proper medical facilities with the help of the Central government. So, it has been unanimously decided that it will be appropriate to continue closure of shops for one more week from Monday,” said Praveen Khandelwal, secretary general of CAIT.Government records state that a high proportion of patients in Delhi currently are on supplemental oxygen and under ICU care which has led to a quantum increase in medical oxygen requirement in various Covid-related health establishments. On April 22, the DDMA even stated that in many cases, the existing contractual arrangements with suppliers have either been disturbed or the health facility’s oxygen requirement has exceeded the contractual quantity, thereby leading to “widespread disruption” in the supply chain leading to a precarious situation. “Furthermore, local supply side disruptions in the neighbouring states is leading to wide variation in day-to-day delivery of oxygen to Delhi,” it stated on April 22.While the restrictions are not entirely a curfew, movement will be prohibited unless someone is seeking or providing essential services, medical help, or has to go to a handful of exempted workplaces, such as government offices. People in some of these categories will require an e-pass from the government, while others will need to show an identity card. The rules are almost identical to those for the weekend and night curfews imposed in Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/lockdown-in-delhi-may-be-extended-by-a-week-101619292436290.html

25-04-2021||Chandigarh||Now, Panjab University senate polls to start on May 3||The polling for the election of six members to the senate from the faculties of Panjab University has been postponed from Monday (April 26) to May 19.Now, the senate polls will begin on May 3, with the election for the constituencies of principals and staff of technical and professional colleges.Six members are elected to the PU senate from the faculty of arts, science, medical science, languages, law and combined faculties. Twelve candidates are in fray from the constituency, which has 754 eligible voters. There is no change in the schedule of the other seven constituencies of the PU senate so far.The decision comes two days after the university had announced that the meetings of faculties will be held online on Monday, prior to the physical voting at the venues.The order issued on Saturday states that the varsity has received representations from some members of the faculties, seeking postponement of the election, as they won’t be able to participate due to the Covid surge.It also mentioned that concerns have been raised over the validity of online meetings of faculties in the absence of any supporting provision in the PU calendar.Subhash Sharma of BJP group, who has objected to online meetings of faculties, said, “The election process should be held as per the rules and regulations in the PU calendar. The meetings of the faculties cannot be held online, as it is illegal, and we won’t take part in it.”Goyal group raise concern over postponementIn a letter issued to voters, members of Goyal group who were contesting from the constituency of faculties, expressed concern over the varsity’s move to reschedule election at this stage.Navdeep Goyal, Ashok Goyal, Keshav Malhotra, Rajesh Gill, Ronki Ram and Anu Chatrath in the letter said that the move is in defiance of a High Court order. They said that the election was rescheduled just 48 hours prior to voting and the only agenda is to delay and defeat the democratic process.Navdeep Goyal said, “If this is the case, then all decisions taken by the university in online meetings are invalid. The semester exams were held in online mode twice and the meetings of Board of Finance (BoF) was also held in online mode in absence of any such regulation in the PU calendar. With the logic given for rescheduling the elections, there will be a big question mark on the degrees issued by PU in contravention to regulations.”Former senator Ashok Goyal, said, “It is the outright murder of democracy by forces who do not want elections to be held. It has already been delayed by more than eight months. We demand an independent inquiry into how this happened.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/now-panjab-university-senate-polls-to-start-on-may-3-101619291231737.html
25-04-2021||Chandigarh||Limited oxygen supply choking private hospitals in Chandigarh||Private hospitals in Chandigarh are scrambling for medical oxygen cylinders amid a surge in demand and dwindling supply.As the private suppliers have reportedly hiked the prices, the Chandigarh administration has now decided to provide oxygen cylinders to private hospitals from the central quota set for the UT.At least three private hospitals in the city, which have around 60 to 70 Covid-19 patients from the region, have stated their helplessness in getting adequate oxygen with private suppliers unable to meet the required capacity.Dr Hardeep Singh Santokh of Santokh Hospital, Sector 38, said: “While our demand has doubled from 20 cylinders to 40, the supply is scarce, leading to a crisis-like situation. Also, the suppliers have doubled the prices of filled cylinders, from ₹240 per unit to ₹500.”Dr Sanjay Bansal, owner of Eden Hospital, Industrial Area, and Dr SPS Chawla, administrator at Landmark Hospital, Sector 33, said there was a problem with refilling the cylinders, and the rising prices were putting further stress on the supplies.Chandigarh health secretary Arun Gupta said the administration on Saturday decided to allocate five tonnes of oxygen for filling cylinders of both private and government hospitals.“Cylinders of private hospitals will be refilled through the bottling plants located in Punjab by Sunday, as per the requirement,” he said.Mohali hit by shortage of empty cylinders Meanwhile, in the neighbouring Mohali district, the administration claims that it has ample supply to meet oxygen demand, but there is a concern over the shortage of empty cylinders. Now, the district authorities have written to the department of industries to divert empty cylinders for hospital supply.“We are constantly monitoring the availability of oxygen in each of the hospitals with dedicated Covid beds. As of now, there is sufficient oxygen available with each of them for both Covid and non-Covid patients,” said Mohali deputy commissioner Girish Dayalan.The Punjab government has already provided five tonnes of additional oxygen to Mohali district, which would soon be made available to hospitals, said a senior administrative officer.“As of now, Hitech Industries Limited is supplying oxygen to various hospitals, while two suppliers — Hind Air and AGPL — are out of stock. We are in touch with the state government to provide them with liquid so that the growing demand of oxygen is met without any constrain,” said the official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/limited-oxygen-supply-choking-private-hospitals-in-chandigarh-101619291161928.html
25-04-2021||Other||Mansukh Hiran murder: Mumbai Police inspector Sunil Mane suspended after arrest||Mumbai Police inspector Sunil Mane, who was arrested on Friday by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) in connection with the Antilia explosives scare and Thane trader Mansukh Hiran’s murder cases, has been suspended from the service. Mane is presently in NIA custody till April 28. Additional commissioner of police (armed police) Virendra Mishra confirmed the development. Mane, a 1995-batch Maharashtra Police service officer, was in charge of Mumbai crime branch’s unit 11 until he was recently shunted out to the local arms division as a part of the clean-up drive undertaken by police commissioner Hemant Nagrale, after another officer, Sachin Vaze, was arrested by NIA in both the cases. Meanwhile on Saturday, an NIA team took Mane to three spots at Thane where they inspected in connection with Hiran’s murder. Sources said that the team visited Manpada junction and Gaimukh, where Hiran was allegedly smothered. After revisiting the two spots along Ghodbunder Road, the team took Mane to a creek at Reti Bunder, Mumbra, where Hiran’s body was found dumped on March 5.On February 25, a Scorpio car was found abandoned near industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s south Mumbai residence Antilia with 20 loose gelatin sticks and a threatening note. A case was registered with Gamdevi police station on the same day. Vaze was originally in charge of the investigation of the case, but was removed after reports emerged of his links with Hiran, who was in possession of the SUV, and had reported it stolen on February 17. On March 5, Hiran was found dead in at a Mumbra creek. It was later discovered that Vaze had borrowed Hiran’s car in November and returned it in February. NIA took over the explosives case on March 8 and Vaze was named the main accused in the Antilia case and was arrested by NIA on March 13. On March 24, the agency began probing the murder too and named Vaze the main accused in that case also. To contain the damage, the Maharashtra government transferred Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh for his alleged management of the case. Singh subsequently wrote a letter to the chief minister, alleging that home minister Anil Deshmukh had instructed Vaze and some other Mumbai Police officers to extort ₹100 crore from bars, restaurants and hookah parlours. Singh then approached the courts, when no action was taken against Deshmukh. The Bombay high court eventually asked the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to conduct a preliminary inquiry into the matter, prompting Deshmukh’s resignation. Accordingly, the central agency conducted registered an offence against Deshmukh on April 24. According to NIA sources, Mane was purportedly part of the conspiracy hatched to eliminate Hiran. He was present at crime intelligence unit (CIU) office on March 3, when Vaze purportedly tried to convince Hiran to take the blame for placing the explosives-laden Scorpio near Antilia. According to an NIA officer, Vaze had also assured the trader that he would get him out on bail in a few days. The plan to eliminate Hiran was allegedly hatched after the 48-year-trader refused to take the blame and get arrested in the case. The officer added that Mane was also allegedly present at the meeting attended by Vaze, Vinayak Shinde – a former constable arrested in the Hiran case – and an ex-police officer before the murder at Chakala in Andheri. According to NIA, Mane was under suspicion from the beginning. When NIA began the probe, he was the Kandivli crime branch’s unit in-charge. Incidentally, the person who made the last call to Hiran around 8.30pm on March 4, the day he went missing, identified himself to be a crime branch officer from Kandivli and had drawn the victim out of his Thane residence on the pretext of a meeting along Ghodbunder Road. The next day, Hiran’s body was found in a creek at Reti Bunder near Mumbra. Beside Mane, Vaze and his colleague at CIU, Riyazuddin Kazi, have been suspended from service after their arrests.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/mansukh-hiran-murder-mumbai-police-inspector-sunil-mane-suspended-after-arrest-101619291101293.html
25-04-2021||Mumbai||State’s CFR sees sharp rise in past three days||Maharashtra’s Covid-19 case fatality rate (CFR) has seen a marked increase in the past three days — it was 1% between April 22 and April 24, up from the 0.40%-0.70% recorded in the previous three weeks. The CFR is the percentage of deaths per total cases.The state on Saturday recorded 67,160 new Covid-19 infections and 676 deaths, taking the tally and toll to 4,228,836 and 63,928.The state recorded its highest single-day toll of 773 on Friday, indicative of the increase in CFR from 0.69%, 0.53% and 0.48% in the third, second and first weeks of April respectively.Dr Subhash Salunkhe, advisor to the state government on the management of Covid-19 cases, attributed multiple reasons to the high death toll. “The patients are being admitted late after developing complications, in addition to the shortage of beds and oxygen,” said Salunkhe. The total number of active patients in Maharashtra currently stands at 694,480.According to Dr Jeevan Jain, a leading physician Lalbaug, the problem is the delay in diagnostic reports and treatment. “The diagnostic centres are overburdened and it takes four to five days to get reports. In this, precious time is lost and complications set in. After this, there are no beds and this has contributed to the high number of deaths,” said Jain. Jain who has treated more than 15,000 Covid-19 patients says he looks at every patient with fever as potential Covid-19 patients and hence starts treatment on those lines.“I start with mild antibiotic, anti-inflammatory drugs and immune boosters so that precious time is saved,” he added. In addition, the state continued to face shortage of oxygen, hospital beds and Remdesivir injections.Meanwhile, Maharashtra deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar said that state will float global tenders for Remdesivir and vaccines.In view of the shortage of Remdesivir injections, the Central government will provide 435,000 vials to Maharashtra by April 30.Previously, the central government used to provide 269,000 vials to the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/states-cfr-sees-sharp-rise-in-past-three-days-101619291041375.html
25-04-2021||Chandigarh||Record 11 Covid deaths take a toll on Punjab’s Mohali district||The number of Covid-19 deaths reported this month crossed the 100 mark in Mohali district on Saturday, with a record 11 people succumbing to the virus.The tricity’s total stood at 14, highest in the second wave, with three deaths reported in Chandigarh and none in Panchkula. In terms of fresh cases, there was a dip across the tricity, as 1,765 people tested positive, down from an all-time high of 2,201 recorded on Friday, a drop of 20%.As many as 802 cases surfaced in Mohali, followed by 711 in Chandigarh and 252 in Panchkula.Chandigarh had reported record 828 cases on Friday, while Mohali and Panchkula logged their all-time high on Thursday, with 931 and 459 cases, respectively. Meanwhile, the daily positivity rate remained high in Chandigarh and Mohali, recorded at 19.4% and 17.7%, respectively, while it stood at 9% in Panchkula. A positivity rate of 19.4% (which is approximately 20%) means that of every five persons sampled, one tested positive.24-yr-old among those dead in ChandigarhEleven deaths reported in Mohali were the highest in a day since the outbreak, which took the toll to 540. Among the fresh cases, 280 surfaced in Mohali city, followed by 163 in Kharar, 157 in Dhakoli, 80 in Dera Bassi and the remaining spread across the district.The total has climbed to 40,969, of which 32,387 have been cured and as many as 8,042 are still active. In Chandigarh, a 24-year-old man was among the three people who succumbed on Saturday. A resident of Sector 25, he had acute intestinal obstruction and pneumonia and died while undergoing treatment at the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research. A 51-year-old woman and 61-year-old man from the city also succumbed, taking the death toll to 433. Of 37,943 people tested positive so far, 32,608 have recovered while the number of active cases has climbed to 4,902. Panchkula saw 45% drop in cases, with only 252 surfacing as compared to 453 on Friday. Also, in much relief, no death was reported after four days.However, civil surgeon Dr Jasjeet Kaur clarified that 558 people tested positive in the district on Saturday, but addresses of only 252 could be confirmed. “The remaining will be checked tomorrow, and some of these cases might be added to Panchkula’s tally,” she said.The district has reported 18,737 cases so far, of which 15,909 have been cured, 2,648 are active and 180 patients have succumbed. Hospitals running out of ICU bedsThe steep surge in cases has put a pressure on the health infrastructure across the tricity, with hospitals running out of beds for critical patients.In Chandigarh, all ICU beds with ventilators have been occupied at the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) as well the Covid hospital in Sector 48, while only one remains vacant at Government Multi Specialty Hospital, Sector 17. Of 303 Covid beds at the PGIMER, 255 are already occupied, including 57 ICU beds with ventilators.At GMSH-16, only one ventilator out of seven is available while 88% of the 200 beds with oxygen support are occupied.Government Medical College and Hospital, Sector 32, is better placed with only 58 out of 155 beds occupied, and 18 out of 31 ventilators still available.The hospital in Sector 48 has all its 17 ventilators occupied, though 70 of the 100 oxygen beds are still vacant.UT health secretary Arun Gupta said that critical care beds from other ICUs are being shifted to Covid-19 ICUs to meet the exigency.Meanwhile, Panchkula is left with not a single ICU bed for critical patients. Hospitals in the district have 451 beds dedicated to Covid patients, of which 58 are with ventilators and 323 with oxygen support. While ventilator beds have reached 100% occupancy, only 72 oxygen beds remain vacant.Overall, the occupancy (including for moderate cases) stands at 77%, with 346 of the 451 occupied.Additional deputy commissioner Mohammad Imran Raza, in a statement issued on Saturday, said the district has a sufficient number of Covid beds and adequate supply of oxygen, and private hospitals have been asked to reserve 50% beds for Covid patients.In Mohali, which is the worst hit in the tricity in terms of infection and deaths, 95% beds dedicated to critical Covid cases are occupied. As of now, the district has 789 beds for Covid patients needing tertiary care, of which 220 are for critical cases (Level-3) and 569 for those needing oxygen support (Level-2). While 504 L-2 beds have been occupied, 208 have been occupied in L-3 category. Overall, the occupancy stands at 90.2% with only 77 beds left vacant. To meet the increased demand for beds, the district administration has already directed seven private hospitals to reserve 50% beds for Covid patients, said deputy commissioner Girish Dayalan. The total bed capacity in private and government facilities is 1,844. “We are also considering converting the L-1 facility (for patients not in need of urgent medical attention) in Gharuan, which has 1,000 bed capacity, to L-2 by providing oxygen supply. Apart from this, we are in touch with the army to set up a facility in Mohali as well,” said a senior administrative official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/record-11-covid-deaths-take-a-toll-on-punjab-s-mohali-district-101619290982662.html
25-04-2021||Other||Trouble looms for former Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh after FIR||Former Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh is likely to be in more trouble as the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) filed a first information report (FIR) and conducted searches at his residences. Leaders from the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government feel that the recent developments could make it difficult for the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader to make a political comeback.CBI is probing the allegations against Deshmukh made by former Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh claiming that the NCP leader, during his tenure as home minister, had told officers from the crime branch to collect ₹100 crore a month from commercial establishments. The Bombay high court (HC) had ordered a preliminary inquiry by CBI into the allegations made by Singh. CBI had recently questioned Deshmukh and staff from his office in connection with the case.The ruling parties have alleged the probe by the central agency to be politically motivated and an attempt to defame the state government and its leaders.NCP’s Maharashtra unit chief Jayant Patil condemned the raids at Deshmukh’s residence.“CBI appears to be using the court’s inquiry order to defame Deshmukh. Four people have been grilled by CBI so far, but it is not clear if the agency has submitted its preliminary inquiry report to the court. The probe is being conducted on the complaints by the police officers who have either been arrested or are under scanner in the Antilia explosives scare and Mansukh Hiran death cases. The raids by CBI are for the political reasons,” he said.His party colleague and state minority affairs minister Nawab Malik questioned why has the National Investigation Agency (NIA), probing the Antilia explosives scare and Mansukh Hiran death cases, not revealed what it found about the roles played by suspended cop Sachin Vaze and his bosses in the police.Shiv Sena’s chief spokesperson Sanjay Raut raised questions over the searches conducted by CBI. “Something fishy is going on. Hon Bombay HC had asked CBI to conduct preliminary probe and submit a report. Raids on his residence, lodging an FIR against him… this is a bit too much. It does not seem to be logical (sic),” he had tweeted, adding that he hopes that the action against Deshmukh was restricted to the HC directives.Maharashtra Congress chief Nana Patole alleged that CBI action was being used by the central government to divert the country’s attention from its failure in handling the pandemic and incidents like the deaths of patients at Ganga Ram Hospital in Delhi.Maharashtra Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) chief Chandrakant Patil said that there are few more leaders in MVA government to “face the music”. “Some of them have been facing the probe, while some others are in the offing. There needs to be an inquiry of transport minister Anil Parab, one Mr Ghoadavat who has been named by Vaze in the extortion racket. Vaze has also named deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar. MVA leaders are blaming BJP for the [CBI] action, but it’s a court ordered inquiry,” he said.Though the ruling party leaders have been claiming the probe to be politically motivated, they secretly admit that the situation should have been handled properly. “Like the Sushant Singh Rajput death case, we faulted on handling this case too. The ruling parties should have acted quickly in taking action on Singh’s allegations by appointing the probe panel immediately. Deshmukh should have been removed from the department immediately. Instead of it, the NCP top brass went out of the way and stood by him without taking any action,” said a Congress leader, requesting anonymity.An NCP minister said that the party failed to anticipate the judicial intervention, which was actually the writing on the wall. “More importantly, we could not keep our own serving officers like Singh from taking steps against the government,” he said.Retired IPS (Indian Police Service) officer PK Jain said that the entire episode of the alleged ‘extortion racket’ was shoddily handled by MVA government. “The government did not take cognisance of the very serious allegations levelled by a senior IPS officer, and it was against the spirit of the SC (Supreme Court) order in the Lalita Kumar case that mandates for an FIR in corruption charges. But the government did not even take cognisance of the allegations when they were brought to the knowledge of chief minister, his deputy or even NCP chief Sharad Pawar. Had the government initiated an inquiry at the time the allegations had been levelled or divested the minister of the portfolio, CBI could not have got the chance to step in,” he said.An NCP leader said that the CBI probe may make it difficult for Deshmukh to make a political comeback. “BJP has systematically used the central agencies against the leaders from the Opposition parties. Many of them joined BJP. Deshmukh may have to pay a huge price for the entire episode,” he said.Patil said that blaming BJP for the action was laughable as it was court ordered probe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/trouble-looms-for-former-maharashtra-home-minister-anil-deshmukh-after-fir-101619290861293.html
25-04-2021||Other||Demand for charter flights saw uptick last year amid curbs, safety concerns: Experts||The outbreak of Covid-19 pandemic last year led India, much like the rest of the world, to place curbs on visas and travel to contain the transmission and spread of the virus. The ongoing second wave of the pandemic, which is more infectious, means that the status quo is likely to be maintained in the months to come. In the absence of regular international and domestic flight services and preference for safety, health and hygiene coupled with the need to adhere to social distancing norms for domestic travel, industry experts said international private or business jet operations that were so far considered a travel mode for the “elites” by policy makers in the country recorded an uptick last year. “We ended 2020 better than 2019 with a 10% increase in business in spite of the loss during the lockdown period. We see this trend continuing in 2021 as well,” said Rajan Mehta, chief executive officer, Club One. The private aircraft charter firm witnessed a gradual rise in business from August and saw a perceptible rise during September to December. “The percentage of international bookings has increased because prior to the pandemic, the ultra-wealthy would use private aviation for their domestic journeys but preferred first or business class on commercial airlines when it came to their trips outside the country. This has changed dramatically post-pandemic as they now prefer the safety, convenience and hygiene of a private jet over money,” said Mehta. The segment performed better than the scheduled airlines business – which suffered a much larger impact in the Covid-hit 2020 – as private charters were a preferred mode of transport by customers during lockdown that kept their businesses afloat for companies across the country, said industry insiders. Many first time travellers are also using charter flights to fly to their destinations keeping safety in mind. JetSetGo Aviation recorded a nine-fold increase in its bookings’ queries with around 70% from new fliers, said Kanika Tekriwal, its chief executive officer and founder. Stating that the demand for charter aircraft in India has been growing consistently – backed by more than 6,000 ultra-high-net-worth individuals (UHNWIs) residing in the country – Tekriwal said compared to the growth in 2019, the company was unable to match their progress in 2020. “However, considering 2020 was a dent to all normalities, the industry saw a tremendous growth in its business, as private flying was considered to be a more suitable option due to Covid-19 safety measures with less touch points,” she added. However, KM Unni, chief operating officer, Reliance Commercial Dealers Private Limited, said nearly 95% of private charter fleet was grounded in the first quarter of 2020, owing to government restrictions on flying commercial and general aviation aircraft. “Just about 5% fleet was under service as air ambulances ferried medical supplies and medical staff. The largest customers for private charter operators are corporate houses, especially in auto, real estate, power and infrastructure sectors. But due to the pandemic, none of these sectors seem to be doing well in the current circumstances,” said Unni, adding, “There is a chance of revival only if the economy does well.” ‘Unfavourable regulations’ Though favourable changes in regulations governing the private charter segment in the past two-three years have helped boost the business further, industry leaders said high tax structure, high cost of operation, dearth of MRO (maintenance, repair, and overhaul) capabilities in the country are contributing to the stagnation in private charter business. A 15% percent IATT (inland air travel tax) was levied on air tickets/charter flights in the 1990s, which was a big hurdle in promoting aircraft charter industry in India. This was abolished in January 2005 with protracted efforts from the industry. However, a 10% service tax was introduced in May 2008, which later increased to 12% and finally culminated into GST (goods and services tax) in the year 2017. “Currently 18% GST is being levied on aircraft charter flights, which is again a major hurdle in the promotion of the aircraft/helicopter charter industry in India,” said Sanjay Malhotra, president, Jubilant Enpro Pvt Ltd, while pitching for 5% on aircraft/helicopter charter flights. “Aircraft/ helicopter import/ acquisition procedure needs to be relooked at with a view to ease the procedures, if possible, and promote aircraft/helicopter charter industry and tourism in India,” he added. Stating that there have been numerous barriers as operators in the Indian private aviation industry, Tekriwal said about 25-30% costs, excluding fuel, are dollar denominated, and the rupee depreciation falls back poorly on the aviation industry. These challenges handicap the industry to grow rapidly in the country. Aviation turbine fuel (ATF) is one of the important sections of the aircraft/airline industry. The jet fuel prices are not reduced in proportion to the fall in international crude oil prices. “When there is a rise in crude prices, it increases the fuel cost, which eventually increases the operation cost of the airline. Besides, it compels airlines to go for an upward fare revision to offset the increased cost of operations. No GST should be implemented on fuel as it hits cost of operations very high,” said Tekriwal, adding the need to work around the ease of purchasing the aircraft into India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/demand-for-charter-flights-saw-uptick-last-year-amid-curbs-safety-concerns-experts-101619290741390.html

25-04-2021||Delhi||Send us whatever O2 you can spare: Kejriwal to CMs||With Delhi hospitals on Saturday turning away Covid-19 patients on account of the acute oxygen shortage being faced by them for the fifth consecutive day, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal wrote an urgent SOS to chief ministers of all states, requesting them to send to the national capital whatever surplus oxygen and tankers that they could spare.Requesting that his letter be treated as an SOS, the chief minister said, “Delhi does not produce any oxygen. Due to the severe rise in corona cases in the last few days, many Delhi hospitals have run out of oxygen. Daily supplies of oxygen to Delhi are woefully short of our requirements.”While Delhi’s daily oxygen allocation is 480MT, Kejriwal has said that the city currently requires about 700MT, given the surge in fresh Covid-19 cases -- the national capital has been reporting nearly or over 25,000 cases every day for the past one week at least.Kejriwal said he would be grateful if chief ministers could provide Delhi with any oxygen, along with tankers.“The Central government is also helping us a lot in this regard. However, the intensity of the spread is so severe that it is proving inadequate. Therefore, I would be grateful if you could provide us with any oxygen, along with tankers, from your state or any organisation in your state. I would be personally grateful for your support,” he wrote.Kejriwal’s letter came on a day when the Central and the Delhi government, in a first, sent empty tankers to Durgapur in West Bengal, via an Indian Air Force C17 carrier, to be filled with liquid medical oxygen and brought to Delhi by rail, even as several hospitals continued to send SOS messages to the city administration requesting urgent oxygen supply to treat critically ill Covid-19 patients.The Delhi chief minister also tweeted: “I am writing to all CMs requesting them to provide oxygen to Delhi if they have spare. Though Central govt. is also helping us, the severity of corona is such that all available resources are proving inadequate (sic).”On April 22, Kejriwal, in a press conference, had appealed to all states to put up a united front against Covid-19.He urged all states to help each other and assured them that if Delhi had oxygen in excess, his government would supply it to other needy states.OXYGEN LOGISTICSA senior Delhi government official said the city administration is arranging supply tankers on war footing and is also preparing a proposal for the Central government, suggesting a reallocation of oxygen to Delhi from plants that are nearer to Delhi than from cities such as Durgapur (West Bengal), Kalinganagar and Rourkela (both in Odisha) which are about 1,300-1,600km from the national capital.“Airlifting empty tankers and bringing filled ones to Delhi via rail will take around three days. But sending and bringing back tankers only via rail will take up to four days as a goods/tanker train moves at a speed of 50 kmph. Delhi’s situation is such that we need the full quota of 480MT oxygen supply every day, which is not possible till the time these far-flung areas are dropped from Delhi’s list and nearer (oxygen) plants are allocated to us. Till then, Delhi will continue to have a shortfall of about 100MT, no matter how much effort the government puts in. Also, Delhi’s current need for medical oxygen is around 700MT,” the official said, asking not to be named.“Hence, we are trying to arrange tankers from these far-flung areas itself so that we can save a day or two at least (in transporting the tankers to these areas), until a new arrangement on allocation of oxygen is devised by the Central government,” the official added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/send-us-whatever-o2-you-can-spare-kejriwal-to-cms-101619289578138.html
25-04-2021||Other||Vijayan urges PM to make vaccination free||Thiruvananthapuram: Kerala on Saturday reported another high of 26,685 Covid-19 cases with a test positivity rate of 20.35%, according to state health ministry data, and chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan sent another letter to the Prime Minister, requesting him to make vaccination free of cost in the present scenario. Vijayan told reporters that the three-tier price mechanism for vaccines -- ₹150 for the Centre, ₹400 for state governments and ₹600 for private hospitals -- will lead to exploitation and weaken the fight against the pandemic. Citing some reports, he said ₹600 (equivalent to US$ 8) per shot is the highest in the world and the vaccine firm was distributing the same to neighbouring Bangladesh at half of the cost. “I have written another letter to the Prime Minister citing these facts. Vaccine price is quite high, some studies show. We want the government to stick to its age-old policy of giving vaccine free of cost,” the CM said. He said he had a meeting with private hospital managements on Saturday and asked them to increase their bed capacity to the maximum. “We will have to learn a lesson from the trauma of some of the states in north India. We have enough stock of oxygen, but we may need more beds. There is no need to panic, but we have to be vigilant,” he said, adding the weekend 48-hour lockdown-like curbs were successful. “It is good that people responded well. We may have to tighten the restrictions further going by the caseload,” he said. Many busy roads and markets remained empty because permission was granted to only emergency services. Meanwhile, for the third consecutive day caseload crossed 25,000 -- out of 1,31,155 tests, 26,685 were tested positive. The state also reported 25 fatalities taking the death toll to 5080. The active caseload reached 198,576. Among the infected, 75 are health workers and 30 policemen, according to the data released by the state health ministry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/vijayan-urges-pm-to-make-vaccination-free-101619289601278.html

Talking to reporters in Bengaluru, he said the current situation “does not give enough time for the government” to have health-related facilities in place “without a lockdown”. “The government wants to do it. Everyone says it’s for the best. But people don’t want it. People want everything to be let loose and that those who’re dying should continue dying. All people should be responsible. The government alone cannot do everything. People should step out only if necessary. At least, they should wear masks,” Kumar said. “Hospital beds can’t be created overnight. It will take a minimum of 15 days to put beds, oxygen line and ventilator. For starters, we need to get this equipment. It takes at least 15 days. Even if we get these in place, we still need doctors and nurses in place. There are limitations, so we are trying with what we have… even our doctors and nurses are turning positive,” he said. Karnataka and its capital Bengaluru have been recording unprecedented rise in Covid-19 cases amid the surging second wave. On Saturday, Karnataka reported 29,438 new Covid-19 cases and 208 new deaths. The total number of active cases in the state stood at 234,483 while 14,283 people have lost their lives in the pandemic. Bengaluru alone accounted for 17,342 cases and 149 deaths of the total on Saturday, according to the state health department’s daily bulletin. According to a senior government official, chief minister BS Yediyurappa is likely to seek opinions from his colleagues on imposing lockdown-like restrictions for a week in the state, during a Cabinet meeting scheduled on April 26. The move comes at a time when citing the explosion of Covid-19 cases in Karnataka and especially Bengaluru, which has over 150,000 active cases, the highest for any city in the country, the state’s Technical Advisory Committee on Covid-19 has asked the state government to impose stringent restrictions, including lockdown for 14 days to break the chain. The panel has also recommended to the government to increase the number of beds to tide over the crisis. The TAC members also foresee the third wave Covid-19 in October-November and have, accordingly, insisted that the government should complete the vaccination of vulnerable age groups before the next wave hits. An epidemiologist at the Public Health Foundation of India (PHFI) and a member of the state TAC on Covid-19, Dr Giridhar Babu told news agency PTI: “I have on record said that there are two main strategies. Firstly, we need to reduce the number of cases and that will happen only by a stringent lockdown for at least 14 days. Secondly, we should expand the bed capacity by taking as much as possible beds from all the private medical colleges, nursing homes and hospitals.” Babu said the state may witness the peak of the second wave by the May end or the first week of June. On Thursday, the government announced a partial lockdown, asking the shops and establishments that are not listed in the government order as ‘essential services’ to remain shut till May 4. The ban was apart from the complete weekend lockdown in the state. In the partial lockdown, no restrictions were put on the movement of people. However, this is expected to be reviewed during Monday’s meeting, the senior government official added. On Saturday, state health minister Dr K Sudhakar asked all private and government medical colleges to reserve beds for Covid patients in three to four days. He, however, excluded emergency beds, and those meant for mother and childcare and dialysis from the reservation. “The state hopes to get an additional 7,500 beds by doing this. All hospitals with less than 30 beds should only admit non-Covid patients. All private hospitals with more than 30 beds have to now reserve 80% beds for government-referred Covid patients, including ICU beds, ventilator beds, high-dependency units, and high flow nasal cannula beds. This is an emergency situation,” Sudhakar added. Bengaluru and other parts of Karnataka went on a weekend lockdown on Saturday. Apart from few incidents of police cracking down on violators, the lockdown was complete, said senior police officers in the state. The city’s roads bore a deserted look on Saturday, with most shops, including supermarkets, shut. In the four hours between 6 am and 10 am, when shops involved in essential supplies are allowed to operate, people were seen queuing up to buy groceries and other essential supplies. “The order has not made it clear if we were allowed to step out to buy the supplies or they were to be delivered. Since I had to buy meat, I came out. Police didn’t stop us but only asked us to return home before 10 am,” said Janet Rodriguez, a resident of Cooke Town in Bengaluru. Apart from eateries, all shops remained closed in the city and the roads were empty with barely any traffic, except for delivery executives. A shopkeeper in the area said there was no panic buy. “Even on Friday night, there was no big rush. Even today (Saturday) morning, only our usual customers came,” he said. In Bengaluru, police seized 1,041 two-wheelers, 45 three-wheelers and 65 four-wheelers for violation of the curfew on Saturday. “We have adequate police presence across the city, and we are ensuring that people stay at him. It is just the first day, we believe the situation will streamline by tomorrow,” said a senior police officer. While the state and particularly Bengaluru have been recording unprecedented spike in the cases and deaths due to the virus, experts said besides the complacency from people and lack of planning, the biggest reason was due to the fact that the government stopped listening to the expert panel’s advice. The state’s TAC on November 30 last year had submitted a report to the government, recommending it to prepare for the second wave of Covid-19. The report, a copy of which is available with the Hindustan Times, asked the government to prepare beds, ICUs, ICU-ventilators, and make arrangements for oxygen availability, vital drugs, and other infrastructure, including ambulance services in both private and public hospitals. “An early recognition of the second wave in the state could be done by closely monitoring the seven-day average growth rate… at the district and state levels. The second wave is expected during January-February 2021,” the report stated. Though the second wave came a month late, the government failed to prepare as advised by the experts. One of the most important recommendations of the TAC was to stop mass gatherings. “Super-spreader events during December and January should be strictly restricted and events such as weddings and other social gatherings should be permitted only in open areas and with an audience of not more than 100 persons. A maximum of 200 persons should be allowed at all political and public events, 50 at death ceremonies, and 20 at funerals,” the report read. A member of the TAC said even though state health minister K Sudhakar had pushed for these recommendations, the cabinet didn’t agree to enforce them. “The onset of the second wave was warned by the experts in Karnataka on November 30, 2020. We missed the timing, and the quantum is higher than expected. Governments had all the time to review and prepare,” tweeted TAC member Dr Girighara Babu. “The bed capacity is hardly sufficient for few days. It is also necessary to reduce the speed of transmission. There are only a few options any Government can have when the cases surge rapidly and resources are limited. We need stricter mitigation and containment, starting now,” Babu said in another tweet. Apart from the government turning a blind eye to the recommendations, the complicacy from both civic authorities and the public played a major role in the situation going out of control. “There were two things the BBMP and the respective district administrations should have done. The first step was to impose strict enforcement of social distancing norms. It was done in the initial days, but over a period, markets, malls and other places returned to normalcy. Weddings had guests beyond permitted numbers and political rallies were held with people standing shoulder to shoulder,” said a TAC member on the condition of anonymity. “The second step was to prepare enough hospital beds, ICUs, ventilators and oxygen supplies. We had specifically recommended this in November, February and March but no one was ready to believe our projections,” he added. According to experts, Karnataka used to get 200-300 tonnes of oxygen and it worked for us in the first wave. However, in the second wave, the requirement doubled to 600 tonnes. “As per the chief minister’s letter to Prime Minister (on Friday), the state would require 1,500 tonnes of oxygen in the coming month. The expert committee had projected such rise in the cases, but no one listened,” the expert added. While the government was against any extension of lockdown as it was taking a toll on the economy, experts echoed the government had to impose restrictions. “We are in a partial lockdown right now. We are doing it in the peak of the crisis, if we had taken similar measures earlier, we could have averted this situation where we are reporting close to 100 deaths every day,” said a senior IAS officer, on the condition of anonymity adding that the government recommended to imposed stricter measures, several times. Experts also pointed out that despite the projections from the TAC was of the larger wave, the government’s planning used the numbers from the previous surge. “On the second day of the second wave, we crossed the highest number reported in the first wave. We are now reporting over 100% more cases than the last wave. The government failed to listen to the experts there as well,” a health expert added.

25-04-2021||Delhi||ITO graveyard to stop Covid burials||Amid an unprecedented surge in Covid fatalities, Delhi’s biggest burial ground at ITO has run out of space to bury those dying of the infection and may not take in more bodies from Sunday, graveyard officials have said. Since April first week, when cases started rising, the burial ground has accommodated around 230 bodies.Though there are other burial grounds in Mangolpuri, Madanpur Khadar, Okhla and Shastri Park, which are also being used for burying Covid-19 victims, the Ahle-Islam Qabristan at ITO takes in the maximum load of Covid and non-Covid deaths.At the ITO cemetery, a nearly three-acre plot was set aside last year when the pandemic broke out for burying those dying of Covid. Since March, the graveyard has seen at least 1,200 Covid-related burials, officials said.Covid fatalities have increased rapidly in the last three weeks. In January, Delhi reported an average of 10 deaths daily, which reduced to 2 in February and 4 in March. The average daily deaths is 109 this month.Mohammad Shamim, supervisor of the burial ground, said, “We have completely run out of space... We will not be able to take Covid bodies from Sunday... So, we have written a letter to the Delhi Waqf Board and government officials to allot space in other areas for Covid burials.”Delhi Waqf Board is the custodian of most graveyards in Delhi.Arshad Ali Fehmi, member of the 10-member managing committee of the ITO graveyard, said, “We have been writing to multiple agencies asking for another land... At ITO, we have run out of space...”Graveyard officials have also requested authorities to send Covid bodies to other graveyards in Rohini, Dwarka, Nizamuddin and Seelampur. “Before Covid, we used to get around 8-10 bodies every day. But now, we are getting nearly 50 bodies on an average...,” said Fehmi.Delhi Waqf Board chairman Amanatullah Khan said they have not received any letter from the officials running the ITO burial ground. “We will make arrangements, if they approach us,” he said.Jai Prakash, mayor of North MCD, said they wrote to the Delhi Waqf Board earlier this month. “We asked them to identify land for burial but nothing has happened on that front so far. We have increased around 300 platforms for Covid cases in multiple cremation grounds...,” the mayor said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/itograveyard-to-stop-covid-burials-101619289415563.html
25-04-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Online classes without break taking toll on teachers||A typical day in the D’Sa household starts at 6am when Belinda D’Sa, 42, a college professor starts her day with preparing breakfast for her family of three, before waking up her daughter for her classes. By 7.30am, D’Sa is ready to start back-to-back lectures for undergraduate students of a Vasai college where she teaches Bachelor of Arts students. “Before the pandemic, I would wake up at 6am and be off to college by 7am; our maid would cook and ready my daughter for school. Now I end up doing all the work and conduct classes at the same time. My lectures go on till around 11.30am, following which I focus on household chores. The list of things-to-do is never ending,” said D’Sa.Her routine resonates with several teachers who have spent a large part of last year understanding technology from scratch in order to be able to teach virtually and ensure that lectures are kept interactive enough so students do not lose focus during class. “After lunch, I take a small break before I start helping my daughter with her studies as well as prepare PowerPoint presentations (PPTs) for my next day’s lectures. I teach seven different batches of students and end up preparing at least four to five PPTs every day,” she added. Meenal Bhole, a teacher from Vidya Bhawan High School and Junior College in Ghatkopar, said that soon after schools moved online, teachers started experimenting with various online learning tools. “We learnt how to make videos and edit them, made study material and used various tools to make our teaching interesting. With time, we realised what needs to be improved. For instance, we first made 30 to 40-minute explanatory videos. Slowly, as we realised that students have a very short attention span even to see these videos, we made small clips of 10-15 minutes,” she added. Most schools require teachers to teach for two-three hours every day. However, in actuality, teachers end up working almost throughout the day. “I have a class from 8 to 10 in the morning but after that I quickly finish my chores and take an extra class for students to solve their doubts between 2pm and 4pm. Evenings are spent in making content for the following day — PDFs, PPTs and videos. We also have assessments to do and projects to check,” said a teacher from an ICSE school in the city. The pandemic forced education institutes to think on their feet and immediately embrace technology, and while online classes threw challenges in front of teachers and students alike, the worst hit were students on the margins who needed extra attention, especially in the virtual mode. In some cases, teachers now had to take over the role of a counsellor as well.“I have set aside an hour every evening and informed students and parents that they can call me during that time to discuss their issues or anxieties. Many parents had tested positive in the past few months and were worried that their children would lose out on studies as they had their mobile phones in hospitals. We gave them assurance and spoke to the children to ease their pressure,” added Bhole. Besides teaching, the real challenge for teachers was to keep students engaged in the online mode. “Every day we struggle to make teaching interesting and try to innovate so that students stay on their screens and listen to the classes. Especially with the younger kids, it’s a challenge to keep them away from distractions. There have been instances where children have put their screens off, removed someone from the class or played pranks. We need to be patient yet vigilant to address these issues,” said Ruiee Kapoor, a teacher from St Elias School, Khar. The worst-hit have been first-year undergraduate students of professional courses with delayed start to the academic year, many of whom started their first lectures as late as in March and April this year. The bigger challenge has been for teachers who have already been busy conducting lectures and examinations for other UG batches, and have now started from scratch with the first-year batches. “Usually all classes and exams would be over by May end and teachers would get at least two-three weeks of break before starting the next academic year. This year, while the second, third and fourth-year students finish their classes, teachers are busy with the first-year batch which will continue till July-August 2021 at least,” said Gopakumaran Thampi, principal of Thadomal Shahani Engineering College in Bandra. He added that while teachers have the advantage of conducting classes from home, many are reaching the point of exhaustion. “If this continues, and teachers don’t get a break, they will reach a breaking point and we will have to think of ways to ensure they get ample rest before the start of the next academic year,” added Thampi. Over the past one year, teachers have been working relentlessly, working on holidays, keeping their personal priorities aside. This year, as summer breaks are just a few days away, the state education department is yet to announce vacations for teachers. “We have not taken a break for an entire year and wish to get just a few days off. We hope the government takes a call on this soon and announces vacations,” said Rajesh Pandya, vice-president of Teachers’ Democratic Front.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-online-classes-without-break-taking-toll-on-teachers-101619289121282.html
25-04-2021||Delhi||Delhi runs low on oxygen, high on cases for fifth day||Delhi woke up on Saturday to the news of at least 20 Covid-19 patients dying due to alleged low oxygen pressure at a private hospital in the city as the government scrambled to move medical oxygen to city hospitals amid a raging surge in Covid-19 cases and four medical institutions moving the high court to demand replenishments.For the fifth day in a row, Delhi hospitals and nursing homes posted SOS messages on the social media and wrote to the government, warning their oxygen supplies were running precariously low.Jaipur Golden hospital in Rohini, where twenty patients under critical care died, raised alarm twice on Saturday to get oxygen supply. Two other private hospitals in the city completely exhausted their supply and requested their patients to either get an oxygen cylinder or look for beds in other hospitals.This was at a time when there were just about 12 ICU beds vacant across city hospitals, according to the Delhi government app.One of the biggest Delhi government-run hospital, Guru Teg Bahadur, had to reduce the number of beds from over 900 to 700 on Saturday due to the high oxygen requirement. According to senior officials, the hospital oxygen plant had been running over capacity due to the high load of Covid-19 patients.“When a hospital is planned, it is estimated that 20 to 30% of the beds will need oxygen supply. But, since we take in only very sick Covid19 patients, 100% of our beds need oxygen support. And, 50 to 60% of the beds need high flow oxygen. This was putting too much pressure on our plant. So, we decided to reduce the number of beds,” the official said.Admission to the emergency department of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences was also restricted for an hour so that the hospital could manage its gas pipeline to meet the increased requirement for oxygen.Saroj hospital in Rohini, which needs around 3,500 cubic metres of oxygen a day, received 2,250 cubic metres. On Saturday morning, the hospital informed the relatives of the patients to either look for oxygen or oxygen beds in other hospitals.The family of a 45-year-old patient admitted to the hospital arranged two oxygen cylinders and an oxygen concentrator to ensure that he received continuous care. “What is the hospital supposed to do if they are not getting oxygen? The government should arrange all this,” said the brother of the patient, who did not wish to be named.At 2.30pm, when the hospital’s oxygen tank ran dry, a team of 180 doctors and nurses were deputed to administer oxygen to patients with small cylinders, usually used while transporting patients.“We somehow managed to help all our patients. There was a team of 180 doctors and nurses who kept monitoring the oxygen of each patient. The stable ones – not on ventilator or high flow – were given oxygen intermittently to conserve oxygen. The oxygen tanker came to the hospital in the next 35 minutes. If it hadn’t, we wouldn’t have lasted long,” said Dr PK Bharadwaj, chief executive director of the hospital.Batra hospital ran out of oxygen at 2.30pm on Saturday. The hospital had to refill 210 of its oxygen cylinders thrice to keep the patients going till 4.45pm when it got a refill of medical oxygen. The hospital raised alarm bells at 9am, with oxygen being supplied only to patients on ventilators or dependent on high flow. The rest were being given oxygen through cylinders. Even after receiving the supply, the hospital has decided to keep the flow to the building with non-ICU patients low.Sir Ganga Ram hospital said healthcare workers had to manually pump oxygen for half a day to at least 29 critical patients who were on ventilator due to reduced oxygen pressure.“The whole administration is busy in making frantic calls. Patients are suffering. To run ventilators, oxygen reservoir should have 3,000 cubic metres of pressure. We are getting supplies of 500 to 1500 cubic metres only . We have 516 Covid patients, 129 of them in ICU and 29 on invasive ventilation. These 29 patients are on manual ventilation since midnight,” said Dr DS Rana, chairman, Sir Ganga Ram hospital.Referring to the hearing in the high court, the office of Delhi health minister said as against 480 MT of oxygen allocated to Delhi, only 309 MT was received on Friday, which is the main cause behind the crisis. “Delhi government has also stated that the root cause of this issue was that in the revised allocation plan devised by Central government, for the first time ever, 102 MT of supply for Delhi has been allocated to plants far away in Odisha and West Bengal, more than 1,000 kms away. This was done without Centre making any corresponding arrangement for tankers to supply this oxygen or any consultation with Delhi government,” the health minister’s office said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-runs-low-on-oxygen-high-on-cases-for-fifth-day-101619288982023.html
25-04-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai civic body to set up 16 oxygen plants at 12 hospitals||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) on Saturday announced to set up 16 oxygen plants at 12 hospitals across the city. These plants are estimated to produce 43 metric tons (MT) of oxygen on-site itself, from atmospheric air. It will take one month for the plants to be commissioned, as the tendering process for the same is ongoing, the BMC said. Once completed, the plants will have a life span of a minimum of 15 years and a maximum of 30 years. The project is estimated to cost ₹90 crore. The civic body announced on Saturday, “Once commissioned, these plants will decrease BMC’s dependency on third parties for oxygen supply. It will also cut cost by more than half if compared to the cost of the acquiring equal amount of oxygen as Jumbo cylinders from the market.” P Velarasu, additional municipal commissioner (projects) will be in charge of implementing this project. Mumbai presently utilises 240 to 250 MT of oxygen per day across hospitals in the city. BMC has two suppliers on board to meet this demand. However, in its statement, the civic body said on Saturday, “Considering the increasing demand of oxygen for the rising number of Covid-19 patients, many of whom require constant and measured oxygen supply, the government and administration find themselves in a tight spot to ensure supply from market always meets demand. To decrease this dependency, such oxygen plants will be set up.” This will also ensure the civic body has permanent infrastructure for the manufacture of such an important resource, the statement said.Presently, BMC has an oxygen generating plant with a capacity of about 500 cubic meters per day at Kasturba Hospital, set up two years ago, and a project at Hindu Hridaysamrat Balasaheb Thackeray Trauma Hospital in Jogeshwari with a capacity of 1,740 cubic meters per day, set up a year ago. “Oxygen generation projects in both these hospitals are functioning well and they are becoming very valuable during the period of Covid-19 infection. Both of these projects are based on the technique of generating oxygen from atmospheric air,” BMC said.When supplying oxygen to patients using the pressure swing absorption technique, the air is first compressed at the appropriate pressure in the plant and then filtered. This removes impurities from the air such as dust and other particles. The purified air available after this process is collected in an oxygen generator. Both the nitrogen and oxygen gases are separated from this pure air by a chemical mixture called zeolite, ​​in the oxygen generator. Separated oxygen is stored at an appropriate pressure. It is then supplied to the patients through ducts or pipes.On April 18, the Twitter handle of the health ministry tweeted that of the sanctioned plants, 33 had been installed in various states and Union territories, including Himachal Pradesh, Chandigarh, Gujarat, Bihar and Maharashtra, among others. “In addition to the 162 plants already sanctioned, [states] have requested Government of India for more than 100 such additional plants, which are also being sanctioned,” the verified ministry handle stated.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-civic-body-to-set-up-16-oxygen-plants-at-12-hospitals-101619289061300.html
25-04-2021||Other||Virar hospital fire: Hospital blocked rear emergency exit point, say sources||A startling disclosure has come to the fore that the management of the Vijay Vallabh hospital in Bolinj, Virar (West) had allegedly blocked the rear emergency exit by constructing a wall and a room. The sources revealed that many of the victims had to use the main entrance door at the time of the blast in the air conditioning unit on Friday. Fifteen Covid patients were charred to death after a fire broke out on the second floor of a four-storey private hospital, Vijay Vallabh Covid Care Hospital, in Virar in the early hours of Friday.However, Gangatharan D, VVMC commissioner skirted the issue and said he was unaware of the same. He said the probe is being done by the Mira Bhayander Vasai Virar (MBVV) Commissionerate and refused to comment further on the issue. According to hospital sources, the wall was constructed a month ago by the management. At the time of the incident, there were 90 Covid-19 patients admitted at the hospital. The sources said that at the time of the incident, the ambulances were parked outside the main entrance. The chaos in shifting the burn patients to other hospitals could have been smooth if the rear exit existed, said the source. Sanjaykumar Patil, the deputy commissioner of police, zone 2, said, “The probe has been handed over to the crime branch. We are studying all the documents related to the structural, fire and electrical audits. Till now, no arrests have been made against the hospital management, doctors and staffers in the case, but we are probing all possible angles,” said Patil.Around 17 patients were in the intensive care unit (ICU) on the second floor of the hospital, constructed in 2014, said the source. The ward boys had to take out the victims through the main door, said the source.The Vasai civic body had conducted a fire, structural and electrical audit a few months ago. The wall was constructed a month ago, without the Vasai-Virar Municipal Corporation (VVMC) in the know, said Manoj Patil, a social worker from Vasai. “There is a huge question on the authenticity of the audit certificates issued to the hospital by the Vasai civic body. The electrical audit of hospitals is to be done every six months by the Public Works Department and the Vasai civic body needs to be questioned over this,” said Patil.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/virar-hospital-fire-hospital-blocked-rear-emergency-exit-point-say-sources-101619289001233.html
25-04-2021||Pune||Pune: 8 Remdesivir black marketeers nabbed over two days||In three different actions by the police in Pune district in the past two days, nine people have been arrested and 14 doses of the experimental Covid-19 treatment drug have been recovered collectively by Pune city and Pune rural police.In one case, a nurse from a Covid centre in Hadapsar was found helping a pharmacist who was arrested on Thursday by Pune city police.The nurse was identified as Ribika Vairagar (35), a resident of Pisoli and working at a Covid hospital in Hadapsar while the pharmacist, arrested earlier, was identified as Ankit Vinod Solanki (26) who works in a pharmacy attached to a hospital in Kondhwa.“It started with them selling the doses that were left over from the patients who had succumbed to the infection but as the demand increased, the cost also increased and the nurse started stealing the injections, from our primary investigation. As per their statement, they have sold 70-80 injections in the past month or so at fluctuating rates,” said Namrata Patil, deputy commissioner of police, Zone-5 of Pune police.While three injections were found from Solanki during his arrest, the woman was found in possession of four more.The police found a link to the woman while investigating Solanki’s source of Remdesivir. The nurse allegedly stole the injections which were procured either by the relatives and the hospital that employed her for patients.In the second case, four people were arrested for selling Remdesivir injection on the black market in Pune on Friday. The accused were selling the experimental drug used for treatment of Covid-19 for ₹37,000 per injection. One vial was recovered from them.The four were identified as Nikita Gopal Tale (25), a resident of Mahatma Phule nagar in Bhosari MIDC; Rahul Balasaheb Valunj (27) and his younger brother Rohan (20) both residents of Chaphekar Chowk in Chinchwad; and Pratik Gajanan Bhore (26), a resident of Anusaya Park in Pune. The four are in police custody until Monday.“Rahul is an engineer who works in the robotics field. He had gained access to the injection. We are investigating how he got it. Bhore and Tale are in the marketing field and work for a business card printing company,” said senior police inspector Mahendra Jagtap of Unit 2 of Pune police.In dual action by the Pune rural police, three people were arrested for selling Remdesivir on the black market and recovered 6 vials of the drug from two separate cases on Saturday. While one action was in Daund, the other was in Narayangaon area of Junnar.The ones arrested in Daund were identified as Akshay Rajesh Sonawane ((24) a resident of Gandhi chowk area of Daund and Suraj Sajay Sable (23) a resident of Shalimar Chowk area of Daund.

25-04-2021||Chandigarh||Six patients die at Amritsar pvt hospital gasping for oxygen, probe begins||In the first such incident in Punjab, six critical patients, four of them suffering from Covid-19, died on Saturday morning after the medical oxygen supply dried up at Neelkanth Multispecialty Hospital in Amritsar. Amritsar civil surgeon Dr Charanjit Singh said the hospital was authorised only to admit only Level-2 Covid-19 patients but it admitted four level-3 patients without informing the health department. As ordered by chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh, Amritsar deputy commissioner constituted a two-member inquiry panel with instructions to submit a report within 48 hours. “Due to the shortage of cylinders in the district, oxygen supply at Neelkanth Hospital dried up this morning, resulting in the death of six patients. Of the dead, two were from Gurdaspur district, one from Tarn Taran and three from Amritsar district. All six patients were in a critical condition when they were admitted to the hospital on Thursday or Friday,” Amritsar deputy commissioner Gurpreet Singh Khaira said. During the incident, around 12 Covid-19 patients were being treated at the hospital. As per hospital authorities, around 25 oxygen cylinders were supplied to the Hospital on Friday, against the requirement of 50. At around 1am on Saturday, the oxygen dried up and the six patients, including a 28-year-old Gurdaspur man, died around 3am, after gasping for two hours. The other deceased were above the age of 48. Family members of those died raised slogans against the district administration and hospital authorities. They blamed the hospital authorities for charging a big fee and still not providing basic life-saving facilities. “My 80-year old mother-in-law was among the dead. We were paying ₹20,000 per day since Thursday to the hospital. The hospital authorities forced us to sign consent form saying that the hospital is not responsible if it runs out of oxygen. Strict action should be taken against them,” said Vicky of Amritsar. BLAME GAME BEGINS The private hospital authorities blamed the district administration for the incident, saying they had conveyed the shortage of oxygen cylinders on Friday itself. Neelkanth Hospital managing director Sunil Devgan said, “We had been seeking oxygen supply for the last 48 hours but the administration bought the oxygen cylinders for government hospitals. Administration is responsible for the shortage in private hospitals.” Khaira said, “AT a meeting on Friday, we had told the owners of private hospitals not to admit any critical patient if they are short of oxygen. We could arrange only a few cylinders for GMCH, where more patients are admitted. If Neelkanth Hospital was short of supply, they should have referred the patients to other hospitals.” The civil surgeon also said the hospital didn’t have any senior doctor on night duty in their Intensive Care Unit (ICU).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/six-patients-die-at-amritsar-private-hospital-due-to-oxygen-shortage-101619244539968.html
25-04-2021||Noida||Ghaziabad runs out of ICU beds, records over 1,000 Covid-19 cases||Ghaziabad’s intensive care beds are almost full while the overall occupancy of Covid-19 beds was around 80%, according to official data released on Thursday.The district has 38 Covid hospitals, four of which are public. It has 2,909 beds, of which 2,326 are occupied. Only 38 of the 563 beds remained vacant on Thursday night.“That vacancy is mainly because there is no oxygen for those beds,” said an officer from the health department who did not wish to be named. “It is not like as if there are no people who do not need an ICU bed. They are forced to look for beds in other districts due to the oxygen crisis.”The state control room records indicate that the district on Thursday witnessed its highest single-day spike of 1023 cases and eight deaths.The experts said that with rising number of daily cases, there is urgent need for more beds, but regularisation of oxygen supply is a major roadblock in increase of beds.“The conditions on the ground is a major concern. During present times, we must make optimum use of resources. Beds cannot be increased if regular oxygen supply is not ensured and as a result patients will keep roaming around in search of beds. There are hospitals which cannot use ICU beds because of lack of oxygen supply. So, people occupying beds without any major symptoms should leave it for others,” said Dr VB Jindal, former president of Indian Medical Association (Ghaziabad).“Administration should gear up and rope in charitable institutions or NGOs for more beds. The cases are expected to rise further, and we expect that they will reach peak by start of mid of May,” he added.“The trend is headed towards a peak which is higher than the one witnessed last year and some studies indicate that peak will be reach in May. So, we have to wait and watch. Roping in more beds will mean that oxygen supply is to be regularised and it is expected that it is expected to take couple of days as per developments taking place. All precautions are must in present times,” said Dr Lalit Kant, the former epidemiology and communicable diseases head at the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR).District magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey did not respond to calls and detailed query raised to him about the issue of occupancy, new beds and lack of oxygen supply. Shailendra Kumar Singh, additional district magistrate (city) also did not take calls for a response.“The chief minister held a video conferencing on Thursday evening and directed officials that beds of L2 and L3 category need to be increased besides every hospital must display the availability at their premises. An order will be issued soon. He has also directed that RT-PCR testing also need to be increased,” said an officer from health department who wished not to be named.Cases spikeThe sample positivity rate, number of positive samples per 100 tests, in the district in April till date was 5.71% on Thursday. The district suffered eight deaths due to Covid-19, taking its total death count to 125.As per state control room records, it took two days each for the total case count to jump from 29000 to 30000, 30000 to 31000 and 31000 to 32000. On Thursday, the district reached an overall tally of 33000 cases in a single day which is fastest achieved since March last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/ghaziabad-runs-out-of-icu-beds-records-over-1-000-covid-19-cases-101619117271143.html

Biden has said the US won't begin doing so until it has enough supplies at home.Fauci said Sunday that the US would review how to help increase India's vaccine supply, such as by sending them doses or helping them “to essentially make vaccines themselves.”He said, quote: “Bottom line, it's a terrible situation that's going on in India and other lower middle-income countries, and there is more we can do.” (AP) RUP||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-actively-looking-at-ways-to-boost-aid-to-india-anthony-fauci-101619371774093.html
25-04-2021||World||Joe Biden polls positive for first 100 days in office||A majority of Americans approve of President Joe Biden's performance during his first 100 days in office, three new polls found Sunday.Overall, the polls showed a range of 52-58 percent of US adults who say they approve of the job Biden is doing, compared with 39-42 percent who say they disapprove.But the positive ratings are divided along party lines: about 90 percent of Democrats say they approve of Biden's performance, while only nine to 13 percent of Republicans do.Biden's performance is far higher than predecessor Donald Trump achieved in his entire presidency.Trump spent most of his presidency with ratings in the low 40s, and left office on January 20 with a Gallup poll approval of just 34 percent, a record low.A poll by CBS gives Biden the highest ranking, with 58 percent approval and 42 percent disapproval.NBC found that 53 percent of adults approve, while 39 percent disapprove.And a poll by ABC and The Washington Post showed a 52 percent overall approval rating and a 42 percent disapproval rating.Biden's strongest performance across the board was for his handling of the coronavirus pandemic, with 64-69 percent approval.However, the polls found that vaccine hesitancy has increased, with CBS showing that 19 percent of Republicans say they might get the vaccine, and 30 percent saying they won't get it at all.Additionally, Biden received the weakest marks for how he has dealt with the migration situation at the US-Mexico border.The ABC poll found that only 37 percent of adults approved of his approach to the border, while NBC found that only 33 percent of adults approved.While Biden's overall performance so far is generally higher than Trump's, it is lower than that of Barack Obama, under whom Biden served as vice president.Obama had an average of 60 percent approval in his first half year and his predecessor George W. Bush had 53.9 percent.Trump, by contrast, had an average approval rating of 41.4 percent in his first six months.According to data from the fivethirtyeight.com site, Trump was the first president in half a century not to enjoy a honeymoon period with substantially better polling in the first six months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-polls-positive-for-first-100-days-in-office-101619370976019.html

That hesistancy has been seen as a roadblock to the US achieving herd immunity against Covid 19.Collins said some parts of the country are getting close to the 75% or 80% level of those with immunity, when vaccinations are combined with people who have had Covid-19, which also provides immunity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/stop-covid-19-vaccine-finger-wagging-says-top-us-health-official-101619369369278.html
25-04-2021||World||Covid-19 crisis: US to rapidly provide support to India; EU, Germany mobilising aid||The US will rapidly provide support to help India’s Covid-19 response amid mounting calls from lawmakers and businesses for the Biden administration to do more and criticism from some quarters for what is being seen as Washington’s lethargic reaction. The European Union (EU) and Germany said on Sunday they were mobilising aid to support India following a huge surge in Coronavirus infections that has stretched medical facilities across the country and resulted in shortages of oxygen. Canada, Pakistan and Iran too said they were ready to supply equipment and medical supplies to help India tackle the crisis caused by a second wave of infections. India recorded more than 300,000 Covid-19 cases for the fourth straight day on Sunday. Official data showed 349,691 infections were detected across the country since Saturday, while the death toll crossed 192,000. The first expressions of support by senior members of the Biden administration came in the form of tweets by secretary of state Antony Blinken and National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan late on Saturday night. “Our hearts go out to the Indian people in the midst of the horrific COVID-19 outbreak. We are working closely with our partners in the Indian government, and we will rapidly deploy additional support to the people of India and India’s health care heroes,” Blinken tweeted. Shortly after, Sullivan tweeted: “The US is deeply concerned by the severe COVID outbreak in India. We are working around the clock to deploy more supplies and support to our friends and partners in India as they bravely battle this pandemic. More very soon.” Blinken and Sullivan didn’t give specifics of the support. The Biden administration has faced mounting calls to do more on several fronts related to the crisis in India, and criticism for not acting more speedily in the case of a strategic partner. Lawmakers from the House of Representatives and Senate – all Democrats – called on the administration to back a proposal by India and South Africa at the World Trade Organization to grant a temporary waiver from intellectual property rights to Covid-19 vaccines to make them easily accessible. There is also the issue of raw materials for making Covid-19 vaccines, raised mostly by Indian companies with growing popular support. US suppliers of these items are required to prioritise orders from American buyers after President Joe Biden invoked the Defense Production Act. The Serum Institute of India has called for the US to “lift the embargo” on raw materials and the matter has been discussed by external affairs minister S Jaishankar with Blinken, while foreign secretary Harsh Shringla raised it with deputy secretary of state Wendy Sherman. The US side has promised to “give the matter due consideration”. US experts, however, believe the Biden administration should do more. “Tweetments are good, action is better. Time is crucial here,” said Vipin Narang, associate professor of political science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, referring to the tweets by Blinken and Sullivan. Christopher Clary, assistant professor of political science at the University at Albany, described the US response to India’s coronavirus outbreak as “lethargic and inadequate”. “It has been insufficient given the scale of the suffering and inconsistent with our aspirations for the US-India relationship. I hope and expect Washington to do more in the coming days because it is our moral obligation to help a friend in need and it is in our strategic interests not to be seen as unreliable during India’s time of crisis,” Clary said. “As a former US government official, I am embarrassed and puzzled by the slow response,” he added. The US Chamber of Commerce called on the Biden administration to release millions of AstraZeneca vaccine doses from its stockpile, which the US is unlikely to use because Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson shots will more than meet its needs. The US has also not authorised the AstraZeneca shot. Vinod Khosla, a Silicon Valley tech billionaire and investor, and Raja Krishnamurthi, an Indian American Democratic lawmaker, echoed that call. Khosla offered to fund oxygen supplies for India. “I’m willing to fund hospitals in India that need funding to import bulk planeloads of oxygen or supplies into India to increase supply,” he tweeted. Janez Lenarčič, the EU commissioner for crisis management, said on Sunday the bloc’s Emergency Response Coordination Centre (ERCC) was coordinating with member states to rapidly provide urgently needed oxygen and medicines to India. German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who caused a stir in New Delhi last week with her criticism of the slowdown of vaccine exports from India, expressed solidarity in the “common fight” against Covid-19 and said Germany was preparing a “mission of support”. Lenarčič, responsible for EU’s humanitarian aid and the European emergency response coordinator, said the support was being provided in response to a request from India. “Upon request for assistance by #India, we have activated the #EU Civil Protection Mechanism. The [EU] will do its utmost to mobilise assistance to support people of [India],” he tweeted. German ambassador Walter Lindner posted a message from Merkel on Twitter outlining the plans to support India. “To the people of India I want to express my sympathy on the terrible suffering that Covid-19 has again brought over your communities. The fight against the pandemic is our common fight. Germany stands in solidarity with India and is urgently preparing a mission of support,” Merkel said in her message. People familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that details of aid to be provided by EU and Germany were in the final stages of being worked out and a clearer picture would be available by Monday. The EU, through its Civil Protection Mechanism, helps coordinate the response to emergencies in Europe and beyond. Canada’s public services minister Anita Anand told a news conference on Saturday that Ottawa has communicated its willingness to assist New Delhi. “We will stand ready with PPE (personal protective equipment) and ventilators and any items that might be useful for the government of India,” she said. Anand was quoted by the outlet Global News as saying that the Canadian government was in touch with India and through its envoy in New Delhi, Nadir Patel, “about a number of options that may be on the table for us to assist”. In a statement issued late on Saturday, Pakistan’s foreign ministry offered to provide relief support to India, including ventilators, bilevel positive airway pressure (Bi PAP), digital X-ray machines, PPEs and related items, as a gesture of solidarity. “The concerned authorities of Pakistan and India can work out modalities for quick delivery of the relief items. They can also explore possible ways of further cooperation to mitigate the challenges posed by the pandemic,” the statement said. Iran’s health minister Saeed Namaki offered help in a letter sent to his Indian counterpart Harsh Vardhan. “The government and people of Iran are ready to spare no technical assistance, expertise and equipment in these difficult days and at the height of the plight of the dear citizens of India with the Covid-19 epidemic,” he said. “We hope that the exchange of experiences with scientific, research and production centres of the two countries can create a brighter future for the two countries with a long history of scientific, cultural and production exchanges,” he added.

25-04-2021||World||India’s Covid fight: US ready to deploy support, supplies||The United States will rapidly deploy “support” to help India deal with the second wave of Covid-19 cases amidst mounting calls for the Biden administration to do more from lawmakers, businesses and an offer from an Indian American tech billionaire to fund “planeloads of oxygen”.“Our hearts go out to the Indian people in the midst of the horrific Covid-19 outbreak,” said secretary of state Antony Blinken in a tweet on Saturday night. “We are working closely with our partners in the Indian government, and we will rapidly deploy additional support to the people of India and India’s health care heroes.”Shortly after, National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan echoed similar assurances in a separate tweet. “The US is deeply concerned by the severe Covid outbreak in India,” he said in a tweet late on Saturday, adding, “We are working around the clock to deploy more supplies and support to our friends and partners in India as they bravely battle this pandemic. More very soon.”Neither Blinken nor Sullivan gave specifics of what these “supplies and support” would be. Some details are expected later today.The Biden administration has faced mounting calls in recent days to do more on several fronts related to Covid-19 and India. Lawmakers from the House of Representatives and the Senate - all Democrats - called upon it to back a proposal by India and South Africa at the World Trade Organization to grant temporary waiver from intellectual property rights to Covid-19 vaccines, therapeutics and related technologies to make them easily accessible to all countries.The second was the issue of raw materials needed for manufacturing Covid-19 vaccines, raised mostly by Indian pharmaceutical companies with growing popular support. US suppliers of these materials - 35 categories - are required to prioritise orders from American buyers over those coming from other countries. The Serum Institute of India called for the US to “lift the embargo” saying supplies of these raw materials are being held up. India and US officials have been in talks at a very high level - external affairs minister S Jaishankar raised it with his US counterpart Antony Blinken recently and foreign secretary Harsh Shringla discussed it with deputy secretary of state Wendy Sherman. The American side promised to “give the matter due consideration”, according to people familiar with these discussions.And the third was a call from the US Chamber of Commerce, one of the most powerful lobbying groups, for the Biden administration to release millions of AstraZeneca vaccine doses from its stockpile, which the US is unlikely to use because, one, the Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson will more than meet its current and future needs. Two, the US has not even authorised the AstraZeneca vaccine yet.Vinod Khosla, a Silicon Valley tech billionaire and investor, and Raja Krishnamurthi, an Indian American lawmaker who was born in New Delhi, echoed that call on Saturday. “I respectfully but strongly call on the Biden administration to release millions of AstraZeneca vaccine doses to countries hardest-hit by the spread of Covid-19, including India, Argentina, and potentially others,” said Krishnamurthi, a Democrat.But Khosla’s primary offer was to fund oxygen supplies, addressing a critical shortage reported from hospitals around India. “I’m willing to fund hospitals in India that need funding to import bulk planeloads of oxygen or supplies into India to increase supply. Public hospitals/NGO’s also pls reach out,” he wrote in a tweet, copying @PMOIndia and several news publications.Khosla, who made his wealth as a co-founder of Sun Microsystem, is worth $2.9 billion, according to Forbes, which also put him at 174 on its list of billionaires and at 40 on the Midas list of investors. He had co-founded Sun Microsystems, with fellow Stanford graduates. It was acquired by Oracle in 2010. And, he now heads Khosla Ventures, an investment firm.“The AZ vaccine is unlikely to be ever approved in the US given current alternatives here,” Khosla wrote on Twitter about the AstraZeneca vaccine, adding, President Joe Biden, addressing him by his official twitter handle @Potus, “should absolutely release all doses and future commitments for US supply” as the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines will be enough for the US.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indias-covid-fight-us-ready-to-deploy-support-supplies-101619358306732.html
25-04-2021||World||‘Mobilising aid’: EU, Germany on support for India’s Covid-19 response||The European Union (EU) and Germany said on Sunday they were mobilising aid to support India’s Covid-19 response following a huge surge in Coronavirus infections that has stretched medical facilities across the country and resulted in shortages of oxygen. Janez Lenarčič, the EU commissioner for crisis management, said the bloc’s Emergency Response Coordination Centre (ERCC) was coordinating with member states to provide oxygen and medicines. German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who had caused a stir in New Delhi last week with her criticism of the slowdown of vaccine exports from India, expressed solidarity in the “common fight” against Covid-19 and said her country was preparing a “mission of support”. India recorded more than 300,000 Covid-19 cases for the fourth straight day on Sunday. The health ministry said 349,691 fresh infections were detected across the country since Saturday, taking the infection tally to nearly 17 million. The death toll crossed 192,000. Lenarčič, who is responsible for EU’s humanitarian aid and is the European emergency response coordinator, said the support was being provided in response to a request from India. “Upon request for assistance by #India, we have activated the #EU Civil Protection Mechanism. The [EU] will do its utmost to mobilise assistance to support people of [India],” he tweeted. “Our #ERCC is already coordinating [with] EU [member states] that are ready to provide urgently needed #oxygen & medicine rapidly,” he said. EU envoy Ugo Astuto said on Twitter the bloc’s member states will do their utmost to support India “in this difficult moment”. German ambassador Walter Lindner posted a message from Merkel on Twitter outlining the plans for supporting India. “To the people of India I want to express my sympathy on the terrible suffering that Covid-19 has again brought over your communities. The fight against the pandemic is our common fight. Germany stands in solidarity with India and is urgently preparing a mission of support,” Merkel said in her message. Linder too extended sympathy to the people of India on the “terrible suffering” and conveyed his solidarity. People familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that details of aid to be provided by both EU and Germany were in the final stages of being worked out and a clearer picture would be available by Monday. Since Saturday, Indian military aircraft and ships have been used to transport special oxygen tanks, cylinders and liquid oxygen from countries such as Singapore and Saudi Arabia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mobilising-aid-eu-germany-on-support-for-india-s-covid-19-response-101619355786805.html
25-04-2021||World||Canada extends helping hand to India in tackling raging Covid-19 crisis||As the Covid-19 pandemic ravages India, Canada has reached out to New Delhi with an offer to help in any way possible to alleviate the crisis.During the course of a press briefing on Saturday, Canada’s Minister of Public Services and Procurement Anita Anand said Ottawa has communicated its willingness to assist India during these difficult times. She said, “We will stand ready with PPE (personal protective equipment) and ventilators and any items that might be useful for the Government of India.”Anand, who is of Indian origin, was also quoted by the outlet Global News as saying that the Canadian government was in touch with India and through its high commissioner in New Delhi Nadir Patel is discussing “about a number of options that may be on the table for us to assist”. “We will continue to be engaged to assist wherever possible.”Global Affairs Canada, the country’s foreign ministry, also underscored this point, tweeting, “We remain united with our friend and partner and stand ready to assist.” Its Twitter handle Foreign Policy CAN added, “Our thoughts are with the people of #India in the face of the #Covid19 pandemic.”Other senior Canadian leaders have voiced their support for India in this crisis. The country’s ambassador to the United Nations Bob Rae tweeted, “India’s tragedy is our tragedy.” He said this was true not just morally but also empirically. “The virus in all its variants, is not national, or ethnic, or racial, it is global. It will continue to mutate, and destroy lives, until it is defeated everywhere. It will require a global effort,” he said.Former Canadian cabinet minister Amarjeet Sohi welcomed the offer of cooperation from Anand, as he tweeted, “It’s nice to see Canada stepping up to help Indian people in this time of need.” Sohi, who also has roots in India, added that “a lot of us are worried about our loved ones”.In February this year, as the crisis became pronounced in Canada, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had reached out to his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi with a request for vaccines. As a result, a deal to provide two million doses of Covishield, the version of the AstraZeneca vaccine manufactured by the Serum Institute of India, was arrived at and the first consignment of 500,000 doses was sent to Canada in early March.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-extends-helping-hand-to-india-in-tackling-raging-covid-19-crisis-101619349186345.html
25-04-2021||World||Armenian PM triggers early election a day after Biden's genocide announcement||Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan, who was swept to power in pro-democracy protests in 2018, triggered an early election on Sunday to try overcome criticism over his handling of last year's conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh.His resignation, which was expected, came a day after U.S. President Joe Biden said that massacres of Armenians in the Ottoman Empire in 1915 constituted genocide, a move welcomed by Armenians worldwide and condemned by Turkey.Pashinyan told Biden the symbolic decision was a matter of security to Armenia after the six week conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh, in which Turkey backed Armenia's neighbour Azerbaijan, where the ethnic Armenian-populated enclave is located.Pashinyan had been under pressure to resign since he agreed to a ceasefire after ethnic Armenians lost territory in the fighting with Azeri forces in and around Nagorno-Karabakh.He had already named a June 20 date for an early election.Announcing his resignation, he said on his Facebook page on Sunday that he was returning power received from citizens to them so they could decide the future of the government through free and fair elections.He said he had been compelled to agree to the peace deal, which was brokered by Russia, to prevent greater human and territorial losses. The Armenian army called for his resignation and he then tried to sack the chief of staff, a decision blocked by the former Soviet republic's president.Pashinyan updated Russian President Vladimir Putin about the elections and the situation over the Nagorno-Karabakh region, where around 2,000 Russian peacekeepers have been deployed, in a phone call on Saturday, the Kremlin said.The Armenian Prime Minister has complained before that some issues over the region, including the return of prisoners of war, have not been resolved yet.According to the Sputnik media outlet, Pashinyan's My Step ruling alliance led an opinion poll conducted by Gallup International Аssociation at the end of last month.Its main rival is likely to be a grouping led by Robert Kocharyan, Armenia's president from 1998-2008.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/armenian-pm-triggers-early-election-a-day-after-biden-s-genocide-announcement-101619347888319.html
25-04-2021||World||Germany plans to ease Covid-19 restrictions for vaccinated people||Germany plans to ease some of the current coronavirus restrictions for people who have been vaccinated against Covid-19, according to a draft text drawn up by the government and seen by AFP at the weekend.The proposal is to be discussed at a meeting on Monday by Chancellor Angela Merkel's government and the powerful regional state premiers.According to the draft text, it was a question not of awarding people with proven immunity any special privileges, but of "lifting curbs on their basic rights that are no longer justified".The debate comes as Germany is struggling to tame a third wave of coronavirus infections, and just 22 percent of Germans have had their first of two Covid-19 jabs.Under the proposed relaxations, people who are fully vaccinated would no longer have to show a recent negative coronavirus test to enter certain shops, get a haircut or attend certain events.They would also be exempt from quarantining after returning from abroad, unless they were coming from a country classed as a high-risk virus variant area such as India.Rules on social distancing and mask wearing would still apply to everyone.German leaders from across the political spectrum have come out in favour of giving vaccinated people more freedoms.The German Ethics Council, which helped shape the country's vaccine priority groups, said it was becoming harder to justify the restrictions in the face of growing evidence that those vaccinated no longer play a significant role in spreading the virus.Giving the same treatment to people who test negative, are vaccinated or even those who can show they have recovered from Covid and allow them "to access restaurants or shops is ethically unproblematic", council chair Alena Buyx told the Tagesspiegel daily on Sunday.'Emergency brake'New nationwide legislation went into force on Saturday that imposes tougher restrictions in regions with more than 100 new infections per 100,000 residents over a seven-day period for three consecutive days, which currently includes huge swathes of Germany.Merkel had pushed hard for the "emergency brake" rules to become legally binding after many regional leaders refused to take unpopular measures despite rapidly rising case numbers.The new law includes a controversial 10pm-5am curfew and stricter rules for social gatherings and store openings.If the incidence rate climbs above 165, schools must revert to online lessons.The legislation also explicitly allows for "exceptions to be granted to those considered immune", Justice Minister Christine Lambrecht told the Handelsblatt business daily on Saturday.Finance Minister Olaf Scholz, who is running to succeed Merkel in September's general elections, said Germany should go even further and draw up plans for a phased reopening of the country as the vaccination pace picks up speed."By the end of May we should be able to make reliable predictions. I want us, as a government, to commit to clear and brave steps towards reopening," he told the Bild am Sonntag newspaper.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-plans-to-ease-covid-19-restrictions-for-vaccinated-people-101619346929632.html

On Sunday, the country posted the world's highest single-day increase in cases for a fourth day.Italian residents will be allowed to return from India with a negative test result at their departure and one at their arrival and then have to go into quarantine, the minister said.Those already in Italy and who travelled from India in the past 14 days were requested to undergo a swab."Our scientists are at work to study the new Indian variant," Speranza said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/italy-imposes-travel-restrictions-on-india-over-covid-19-variant-101619344606263.html
25-04-2021||World||‘Everyone was jumping, doctors fell on cars’: Baghdad hospital fire kills 82||A fire sparked by an oxygen tank explosion killed at least 82 people and injured 110 at a hospital in Baghdad that had been equipped to house Covid-19 patients, an Interior Ministry spokesman said on Sunday."We urgently need to review safety measures at all hospitals to prevent such a painful incident from happening in future,” spokesman Khalid al-Muhanna told state television, announcing the toll.The fire erupted on Saturday at the Ibn Khatib hospital in the Diyala Bridge area.Ali Bayati, a member of Iraq’s semi-official High Commission for Human Rights, had said earlier a final death toll had not yet been officially announced but it could be between 30 to 45.Patients' relatives scrambled during the blaze to save their loved ones.A man who had been visiting his brother described people jumping out of windows to escape."The fire spread, like fuel ... I took my brother out to the street, next to the checkpoint. Then I came (back) and went up from there. To the last floor, that did not burn. I found a girl suffocating, about 19 years old, she was suffocating, she was about to die," said Ahmed Zaki."I took her on my shoulders and I ran down. People were jumping... Doctors fell on the cars. Everyone was jumping. And I kept going up from there, got people and come down again,” Zaki said.Patients were moved to other hospitals, medical sources said. But several families were still at the hospital hours after the fire had been extinguished, after failing to find them elsewhere.Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi ordered an investigation."Such an incident is evidence of negligence and therefore I directed that an investigation be launched immediately and for the hospital's manager and the heads of security and maintenance to be detained along with all those concerned until we identify those negligent and hold them accountable," he said in a statement.Iraq's healthcare system, ruined by decades of sanctions, war and neglect, has been stretched during the coronavirus crisis. The country has recorded a total of 102,5288 infections, including 15,217 deaths, the health ministry said on Saturday.Security has improved in recent years but Iraq still suffers from political violence, including militia rocket attacks on foreign forces and a low-level Islamic State insurgency.Accidents due to neglect and wrecked infrastructure have compounded the woes of ordinary Iraqis.In 2019, at least 90 people died when an overloaded ferry carrying families on an outing sank in the Tigris river in the northern city of Mosul.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/everyone-was-jumping-doctors-fell-on-cars-baghdad-hospital-fire-kills-82-101619343920384.html

Other European funds and national resources will also contribute to the program.The package will have a “significant impact” on Italy’s economy, which has been deeply scarred by the Covid-19 pandemic and had been undeperforming for the decades before the crisis, the government said. Gross domestic product shrank by 8.9% in 2020.A large share of the resources will be used for infrastructure projects. They will also be used to reduce inequality, with about 40% of the funds destined for Italy’s underdeveloped southern regions. Overall, the allocation of funds is in line with EU requirements, according to the statement.The plan also envisages the modernization of Italy’s inefficient bureaucracy and courts, as well as enhancing competition and cutting red tape.Italy’s plan was signed off at a late night cabinet meeting chaired by Prime Minister Mario Draghi after hours of political wrangling. Draghi will present the plan in parliament on Monday ahead of a deadline to submit it to the EU Commission by April 30.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/italy-signs-off-on-investment-reform-package-to-deploy-eu-funds-101619331886924.html

25-04-2021||World||Asean leaders tell Myanmar coup maker to end killings||Southeast Asian leaders demanded an immediate end to killings and the release of political detainees in Myanmar in an emergency summit Saturday with its top general and coup leader, Indonesia's president said.The leaders of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations also told Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing during the two-hour talks in Jakarta that a dialogue between contending parties in Myanmar should immediately start, with the help of ASEAN envoys, President Joko Widodo said.“The situation in Myanmar is unacceptable and should not continue. Violence must be stopped, democracy, stability and peace in Myanmar must be returned immediately,” Widodo said during the meeting. “The interests of the people of Myanmar must always be the priority.”Daily shootings by police and soldiers since the Feb. 1 coup have killed more than 700 mostly peaceful protesters and bystanders, according to several independent tallies.The messages conveyed to Min Aung Hlaing were unusually blunt and could be seen as a breach of the conservative 10-nation bloc’s bedrock principle forbidding member states from interfering in each other’s domestic affairs. But Malaysian Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin said that policy should not lead to inaction if a domestic situation “jeopardizes the peace, security, and stability of ASEAN and the wider region” and there is international clamor for resolute action.“There is a tremendous expectation on the part of the international community on how ASEAN is addressing the Myanmar issue. The pressure is increasing,” Muhyiddin said, The current ASEAN chair, Brunei Prime Minister Hassanal Bolkiah, and the regional bloc’s secretary general should be allowed access to Myanmar to meet contending parties, encourage dialogue and come up with “an honest and unbiased observation,” he said.Such a political dialogue “can only take place with the prompt and unconditional release of political detainees," the Malaysian premier said.A formal statement issued by ASEAN through Brunei after the summit outlined the demands made by the six heads of state and three foreign ministers in more subtle terms. It asked for the “immediate cessation of violence in Myanmar” and urged all parties to “exercise utmost restraint,” but omitted the demand voiced by Widodo and other leaders for the immediate release of political detainees. It said ASEAN would provide humanitarian aid to Myanmar.It was not immediately clear if and how Min Aung Hlaing responded to the blunt messages.It was the first time he traveled out of Myanmar since the coup, which was followed by the arrests of Aung San Suu Kyi and many other political leaders.Indonesian Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi expressed hopes on the eve of the summit that “we can reach an agreement on the next steps that can help the people of Myanmar get out of this delicate situation.”ASEAN’s diversity, including the divergent ties of many of its members to either China or the United States, along with a bedrock policy of non-interference in each other’s domestic affairs and deciding by consensus, has hobbled the bloc’s ability to rapidly deal with crises.Amid Western pressure, however, the regional group has struggled to take a more forceful position on issues but has kept to its non-confrontational approach.Critics have said ASEAN’s decision to meet the coup leader was unacceptable and amounted to legitimizing the overthrow and the deadly crackdown that followed. ASEAN states agreed to meet Min Aung Hlaing but did not treat or address him as Myanmar’s head of state in the summit, a Southeast Asian diplomat told The Associated Press on condition of anonymity for lack of authority to discuss the issue publicly.The London-based rights watchdog Amnesty International urged Indonesia and other ASEAN states ahead of the summit to investigate Min Aung Hlaing over “credible allegations of responsibility for crimes against humanity in Myanmar.” As a state party to a U.N. convention against torture, Indonesia has a legal obligation to prosecute or extradite a suspected perpetrator on its territory, it said.Indonesian police dispersed dozens of protesters opposing the coup and the junta leader’s visit. More than 4,300 police fanned out across the Indonesian capital to secure the meetings, held under strict safeguards amid the pandemic.The leaders of Thailand and the Philippines skipped the summit to deal with coronavirus outbreaks back home. Laos also canceled at the last minute. The face-to-face summit is the first by ASEAN leaders in more than a year.Aside from Myanmar, the regional bloc is made up of Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/asean-leaders-tell-myanmar-coup-maker-to-end-killings-101619315783386.html

But now we would wait for another week and if the situation doesn’t improve, definitely we would have to think about complete lockdown,” he said.Prime Minister Khan on Friday urged the people of Pakistan to strictly follow the Covid-19 guidelines, warning that another nationwide lockdown will be imposed if the spiralling coronavirus crisis continues to worsen.Khan, who was himself affected by the disease last month, warned that major cities would be closed down if the situation continued to deteriorate."If we (as a nation) don't take precautionary measures, we will have to impose a lockdown which will also affect our economy at a time when it is on the rise,” he said and urged the people to follow the SoPs as they did during Ramzan last year.Khan said he had asked the Pakistan Army to assist police and law enforcement agencies in enforcing SOPs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistans-covid-19-caseload-nearing-796-000-5-611-new-cases-reported-101619337779837.html

Everest shows, their growing passion and love for Everest," says Mingma Sherpa, chairman of Seven Summit Treks of Kathmandu.This will certainly help in boosting Nepal's tourism despite the pandemic, he added.The first cases of Covid-19 have been identified at Everest base camp this week.Nepal insists that visiting climbers quarantine before proceeding to Everest base camp.Nepal has reported 297,087 Covid-19 cases so far with 3,136 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nepal-issues-record-number-of-permits-for-everest-expeditions-despite-covid19-101619335966208.html

The Iran-backed Huthis rarely disclose their own losses.With the Huthis taking control of the Kassara front, the battles have moved to the Al-Mil area, which is a mere six kilometres (four miles) from the centre of Marib and its population centres, they said.However, mountains around Al-Mil remain a formidable barrier to the rebels who launched a fierce campaign for Marib city in February.The government sources said the Huthis had poured in hundreds of reinforcements in recent days to achieve the gains, resorting to motorbikes after the coalition targeted their military vehicles.The loss of Marib would be a disaster for the Yemeni government and for Saudi Arabia which has supported it militarily since March 2015, after the rebels captured Sanaa.The city's fall could also lead to a humanitarian disaster, as vast numbers of civilians displaced from fighting elsewhere have sought refuge in the area.Around 140 camps have sprung up in the surrounding desert to provide basic shelter for up to two million displaced, according to the Yemeni government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/yemen-rebels-advance-on-marib-65-dead-military-sources-101619334810442.html
25-04-2021||World||European Union blames China for endangering peace in South China Sea||The European Union called out China on Saturday for endangering peace in the South China Sea and urged all parties to abide by a 2016 tribunal ruling which rejected most of China's claim to sovereignty in the sea, but which Beijing has rejected.The EU last week released a new policy aimed at stepping up its influence in the Indo-Pacific region to counter China's rising power.The Philippines on Friday protested to China over its failure to withdraw what it called as "threatening" boats believed to be manned by maritime militia around the disputed Whitsun Reef, which Manila calls the Julian Felipe Reef."Tensions in the South China Sea, including the recent presence of large Chinese vessels at Whitsun Reef, endanger peace and stability in the region," a EU spokesperson said in a statement on Saturday.EU reiterated its strong opposition to "unilateral actions that could undermine regional stability and international rules-based order".It urged all parties to resolve disputes peacefully in accordance with international law, and highlighted a 2016 international arbitration that had ruled in favor of the Philippines while invalidating most of China's claims in the South China Sea.China rejected EU's accusation that its ships at Whitsun Reef, which China calls Niu'E Jiao, had endangered peace and security.The Chinese Mission to the EU in a statement on Saturday reiterated that the reef is part of China's Nansha Islands, or Spratly Islands, and that it was "reasonable and lawful" for Chinese fishing boats to operate there and shelter from the wind.The Chinese statement also insisted that China's sovereignty, rights and interests in the South China Sea were formed in the "long course of history and consistent with international law" and rejected the 2016 tribunal ruling as "null and void"."The South China Sea should not become a tool for certain countries to contain and suppress China, much less a wrestling ground for major-power rivalry," the Chinese statement said.China is increasingly worried that Europe and other countries are heeding US President Joe Biden's call for a "coordinated approach" towards China, which had so far materialised in the form of sanctions over its security crackdown in Hong Kong and treatment of Uyghur Muslims.US Secretary of State Antony Blinken last month said Washington "stands by its ally, the Philippines," in the face of China’s massing maritime militia at Whitsun Reef.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/european-union-blames-china-for-endangering-peace-in-south-china-sea-101619330953626.html
25-04-2021||World||US vows ‘more support’ to India; billionaire offers to fund ‘planeloads’ of O2||The US has decided to deploy “more supplies and support” to help India deal with the ongoing second wave of Covid-19 cases. It comes amid mounting calls for the Biden administration to do more - from lawmakers and businesses - with an Indian-American tech billionaire even offering to fund “planeloads of oxygen”.“The US is deeply concerned by the severe Covid outbreak in India,” tweeted US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan on Saturday. “We are working around the clock to deploy more supplies and support to our friends and partners in India as they bravely battle this pandemic. More very soon.”Sullivan gave no details of what these “supplies and support” were and they could not be independently ascertained.The Biden administration has faced mounting calls in recent days to do more on several fronts related to the pandemic’s resurgence in India. Representatives and Senators, all Democrats, have called upon the government to back a proposal by India and South Africa at the World Trade Organization (WTO) to grant temporary waiver from intellectual property rights protections to Covid-19 vaccines, therapeutics and related technologies to make them easily accessible to all countries.Another issue is related to raw materials needed for manufacturing Covid-19 vaccines in India, raised mostly by Indian pharma companies, with growing popular support. US suppliers of these raw materials, which have 35 categories, are required to prioritise orders from American buyers over those coming from abroad. The Pune-based Serum Institute of India (SII) has called upon the US to “lift the embargo”, saying supplies of these raw materials are being held up. Indian and US officials have been in talks on this matter at a high level. India’s external affairs minister S Jaishankar raised it with US secretary of state Antony Blinken recently and foreign secretary Harsh Shringla has discussed it with deputy secretary of state Wendy Sherman. The American side promised to “give the matter due consideration”, according to people familiar with these discussions.There has also been a call from the US Chamber of Commerce, one of the most powerful lobbying groups in America, for the Biden administration to release millions of AstraZeneca vaccine doses from its stockpile, which the US is unlikely to use because firstly, the jabs from Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson will meet the country’s current and future needs; and secondly, the US is yet to authorise the use of the AZ vaccine.Vinod Khosla, a Silicon Valley tech billionaire and investor, and Raja Krishnamurthi, an Indian-American lawmaker born in New Delhi, echoed that call on Saturday. “I respectfully but strongly call on the Biden administration to release millions of AstraZeneca vaccine doses to countries hardest-hit by the spread of Cobid-19, including India, Argentina, and potentially others,” said Krishnamurthi, a Democrat.Khosla’s offer, meanwhile, was to fund oxygen supplies for Indian hospitals facing a critical shortage as they struggle to tackle a fast-escalating number of Covid-19 patients. “I’m willing to fund hospitals in India that need funding to import bulk planeloads of oxygen or supplies into India to increase supply. Public hospitals/NGO’s also pls reach out,” he tweeted, tagging the Indian PMO’s official handle and several news publications.Khosla, who now heads Khosla Ventures, an investment firm, is worth $2.9 billion, according to Forbes, which has put him at No. 174 on its list of billionaires. He is at No. 40 on the Midas list of investors. “The AZ vaccine is unlikely to be ever approved in the US given current alternatives here,” Khosla tweeted about the AstraZeneca vaccine, adding that US President Joe Biden “should absolutely release all doses and future commitments for US supply since Moderna and Pfizer [vaccines] can supply US needs”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-vows-more-support-to-india-billionaire-offers-to-fund-planeloads-of-o2-101619330465655.html
25-04-2021||World||Covid in Germany: Angela Merkel defends 'tough' emergency measures amid 3rd wave||German Chancellor Angela Merkel in a video address on Saturday defended "tough" new coronavirus restrictions amid the third wave and urged German citizens to "do what is necessary again" to slow the Covid-19 pandemic."This is something new in our fight against the pandemic and I am convinced that it is urgently needed because we are in the middle of the third wave," Merkel said, reported euronews.Defending the emergency brake measures, Merkel said that the government had weighed whether such tough efforts were necessary."As much as one would wish there were less burdensome ways to break and reverse the third wave - they don't exist," she concluded, explaining that infections were too high for testing and tracing to be a sufficient means to drive down case numbers, reported euronews.Merkel said that if they are able to reduce infections now, it will be possible to relax the tough measures in the "foreseeable future".She said that the vaccination campaign was "gaining momentum". So far, just over 20 per cent of the population has received the first dose of a coronavirus vaccine.Moreover, Merkel added that doctors and nurses have been calling for help due to high infection numbers and intensive care admissions."These people push their limits every day to save the lives of corona patients," Merkel said, adding that they "cannot do it alone".Germany's parliament, the Bundestag, passed the new "emergency brake" measures earlier this week which now take effect in areas where the incidence rate is higher than 100 new infections per 100,000 people.Those regions will be subject to tougher restrictions including a 10 pm curfew and restrictions on shops and households meeting, reported euronews.Germany recorded 23,000 new Covid-19 cases in 24 hours, according to the most recent figures from the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) and according to the April 22 situation report, more than 5,000 Covid-19 patients are hospitalised in intensive care.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-in-germany-angela-merkel-defends-tough-emergency-measures-amid-3rd-wave-101619329638535.html
25-04-2021||World||Japan to open large Covid-19 vaccination centres in Tokyo, Osaka: Report||The Japanese government is planning to open large vaccination centers in Tokyo and Osaka in the coming weeks to administer shots in a bid to speed up its inoculation drive, local media reported on Sunday.Japan only started vaccinating its sizable elderly population this month and health experts say it may take till the winter (December-February) or longer for most of the general populace to get access to the shots.The Nikkei newspaper said on Sunday the government will open a vaccination site in central Tokyo as early as May that will be able to vaccinate around 10,000 people a day. The site will be open to anyone living and working in Tokyo, the paper said.Medically trained staff from Japan's Self-Defense Forces will also assist with vaccinations in such centers, the Nikkei said.The Japanese government has come under sharp criticism for its sluggish vaccination roll-out, which has been handled mostly by municipal authorities. Japan has vaccinated about 1% of its population, according to a Reuters tracker.Japan has avoided an explosive spread of the pandemic experienced by many countries. There have been about 550,000 cases and 9,761 deaths, significantly lower numbers than in other large economies.But the latest rise in infections has stoked alarm, with a surge in a mutant variant and a critical shortage of medical staff and hospital beds in some areas.Japan's third state of emergency in Tokyo, Osaka and two other prefectures began on Sunday, which will cover nearly a quarter of the population and attempt to combat a surge in coronavirus cases three months before the Tokyo Olympics is set to open.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-to-open-large-covid-19-vaccination-centres-in-tokyo-osaka-report-101619328976066.html
25-04-2021||World||EU agency says clot 'very rare' J&J vaccine side effect||Europe's medicines regulator said Tuesday that blood clots should be listed as a "very rare" side effect of Johnson & Johnson's coronavirus vaccine, but that the benefits of the shot still outweighed the risks.The United States is expected to announce its decision on the single-shot J&J vaccine by Friday, as nations around the world urgently try to accelerate inoculation campaigns and revive their pandemic-ravaged economies.The European Medicines Agency (EMA) assessment came as an EU official promised to have enough doses available to vaccinate 70 percent of European adults by the summer -- a boon for the continent's sluggish rollout.Europe's Johnson & Johnson campaign was delayed after US health regulators said the shot should be paused over blood clot fears.After reviewing isolated cases of clotting among people who received the vaccine, EMA's safety committee said it found a "possible link" to the jab.The regulator said its safety committee "concluded that a warning about unusual blood clots with low blood platelets should be added to the product information" for the J&J shot."This is a very rare effect," EMA chief Emer Cooke told reporters. "But it also makes it very important for doctors and patients to be aware of the signs so that they can spot any concerns."Italy's health authorities said that in light of the EMA ruling, the vaccine should be considered "definitively safe" but the country would prioritise its use for people aged over 60.- 'We remain confident' - Only two countries had started administering the J&J shot before it was paused -- the United States and South Africa -- with more than seven million doses given out so far, according to an AFP tally.The vaccine was praised as easier to administer and transport than some of its rivals, because it requires just one dose and can be stored at warmer temperatures.The EU approved the J&J shot on March 3 and started taking deliveries on April 19, but has not yet started administering it to people.A top Johnson & Johnson executive said Tuesday he hoped for a speedy resolution to the current pause."We remain very confident and very hopeful that the benefit-risk profile will play out," Chief Financial Officer Joseph Wolk told CNBC.The J&J concerns follow similar reports of blood clots in a very small number of people who received the AstraZeneca shot.The EMA also described those clots as a "very rare" side effect, stressing that the AstraZeneca jab's benefits outweigh the risks.Europe's leaders are keen to accelerate vaccinations and expand availability after facing intense criticism over a slow rollout and with the public desperate for a return to some degree of normality.Thierry Breton, the EU's internal markets commissioner, told French newspaper Le Figaro the bloc was now set to have enough doses to cover 70 percent of its adult population by mid-July.The Dutch government said Tuesday it would end its coronavirus curfew and allow cafes to serve outdoors during limited hours from April 28.Elsewhere there was less reason for hope.Moscow's mayor Sergei Sobyanin announced a drive to get elderly residents vaccinated to avoid a lockdown, acknowledging the deteriorating situation there.- 'Like a storm' -And India, home to 1.3 billion people, is battling a worrying surge, with record daily case numbers overwhelming already stretched hospitals.The capital New Delhi was locked down Monday for a week, and the government said all adults would be eligible for a vaccine from May as it tries to get a grip on the crisis.In a televised address Tuesday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi acknowledged that this second wave had hit India "like a storm"."It is a big challenge, but we have to -- together, with our courage and determination -- overcome it," he added.The Delhi lockdown follows strict measures already imposed in other Indian states.The US Centers for Disease Control on Monday advised against all travel to India, and the UK imposed restrictions on arrivals from the country.India's crematoriums and gravediggers have been overwhelmed.Social media and newspapers have been flooded with horrifying images of row upon row of burning pyres. At a cemetery in New Delhi, gravedigger Shamim told AFP: "At this rate, I will run out of space in three or four days."Hard-hit Brazil meanwhile now has the leading overall death rate in the Americas and the entire southern hemisphere, according to AFP data.With 176 deaths per 100,000 people since the beginning of the outbreak, Brazil has recently overtaken Peru with 174 per 100,000 and the US with 172 per 100,000.There was growing concern about a spike in Japan, where the third most populated region, Osaka, on Tuesday asked the central government to impose a state of emergency with infections rising just three months before the country hosts the Olympics.Tokyo and several other areas are expected to follow suit, hoping to avoid Osaka's plight, where hospital beds for seriously ill coronavirus patients have run out.burs-dl/jhJOHNSON & JOHNSONASTRAZENECA||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-agency-says-clot-very-rare-j-j-vaccine-side-effect-101619317465411.html

We will have more to share very soon," the spokeswoman told Reuters via email.US state of secretary said on Sunday that US is deeply concerned by India's current Covid-19 situation. "Our hearts go out to the Indian people in the midst of the horrific COVID-19 outbreak. We are working closely with our partners in the Indian government, and we will rapidly deploy additional support to the people of India and India's health care heroes," Blinken said in a tweet. India is grappling with a record-setting surge in coronavirus infections, with hospitals running out of critical oxygen supplies. The Indian government has deployed military planes and trains to get oxygen to Delhi from other parts of the country and foreign countries, including Singapore.The number of cases across the country of around 1.3 billion rose overnight by 346,786, India's Health Ministry said on Saturday, for a total of 16.6 million cases, including 189,544 deaths.But experts say the number of cases is likely many times higher and could rise further.Officials from both countries are engaged at various levels to ensure "a small supply of inputs and components from U.S. companies for production of Covid-19 vaccines in India," a spokesman at the Indian Embassy in Washington told Reuters."We believe it is important to work together to identify both bottlenecks in medical supply chains and potential solutions for overcoming these (bottlenecks), and to combat the global pandemic together and expedite ongoing vaccination efforts," the spokesman said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/deeply-concerned-by-india-s-covid-19-situation-us-state-of-secretary-blinken-101619322543381.html
25-04-2021||World||6 things to know about Joe Biden's first 100 days||President Joe Biden has hit some big targets in 100 days, starting with an epic effort to pull the United States from its Covid-19 nightmare, but headaches lie ahead.Here are three big achievements and three areas where much remains to be done.Done or getting it done1. Covid vaccinations: the raging pandemic was the gravest single threat facing Biden's administration when he took over on January 20. The solution was mass vaccinations.On this, Biden is delivering. Last week he celebrated the 200th million vaccine shot administered and Covid deaths have fallen dramatically.2. Economic stimulus: Biden pushed through a nearly $2 trillion rescue plan for an economy that has been hobbled and hollowed by the more than year-long coronavirus shutdown.Although Democrats control Congress, their margin is razor thin and he had to work hard to get the American Rescue Plan passed. Polls show it is popular both among Democratic and Republican voters.3. Foreign policy rethink: Biden's priority was to undo what he saw as the reckless damage caused by Donald Trump to traditional US alliances.Inviting Japan's Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga as the first foreign leader to the White House showed that Washington is serious about its ties to Asia.The White House says Biden's own first foreign trip will be to Europe, where he will attend G7, NATO and EU summits in June. The transatlantic alliance, which Trump questioned, is back.As well as returning the United States to the Paris climate accord and seeking to revive the Iranian nuclear negotiations, Biden has also set a clear date for pulling the final US soldier out of Afghanistan: September 11.Still to do1. Working with Congress: Biden promised bipartisanship but so far he has worked on the back of a razor thin Democratic majority.That raises growing doubts over his upcoming big projects -- an infrastructure bill, greening of the economy, police brutality reforms and immigration.Midterm congressional elections next year could erase the Democrats' advantage in Congress.2. Immigration: nowhere has the smooth running Biden administration stumbled more than on handling illegal immigration at the southern border.Biden promised a more humane approach after Trump's hardline crackdown, which relied largely on physical barriers.But the new administration was unprepared for a surge in people, many from Central America. Facilities overwhelmed with unaccompanied migrant children provided Republican critics with political ammunition while angering Biden's own supporters.The administration's confusing back-and-forth on promises to greatly increase the cap on refugees allowed into the United States has fueled the sense of disarray.3. Foreign policy trouble: Although Biden moved quickly to repair ties with allies, his plans for dealing with adversaries remain very much a work in progress.He has also yet to be tested by a genuine crisis. China, Iran, North Korea and Russia could provide one at any time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/6-things-to-know-about-joe-biden-s-first-100-days-101619316849418.html

I respectfully but strongly call on the Biden Administration to release millions of AstraZeneca vaccine doses to countries hardest-hit by the spread of Covid-19, including India, Argentina, and potentially others," he added.India on Saturday recorded 3,46,786 new Covid-19 cases, the highest single-day spike since the pandemic broke out last year.

25-04-2021||World||Armenian Americans celebrate US President Biden's recognition of genocide||Armenian Americans celebrated the news Saturday that President Joe Biden formally declared the systematic killing and deportation of hundreds of thousands of their ancestors by Ottoman Empire forces in the early 1900s to be “genocide,” saying the recognition was long overdue.His action came after decades of activism, most of which was centered in California, home of the largest Armenian community in the nation.“He's the first American president to have the guts to talk about it. I never understood why the U.S. waited this long when they knew the truth about what happened. It's amazing and I'm very happy he did what he did,” said Varoujan Kioudjian, 74.He was among hundreds of people who streamed to a hilltop monument in Montebello, about 10 miles (16 kilometers) east of downtown Los Angeles, to mark Armenian Genocide Remembrance Day.Dressed in black for the solemn ceremony, they laid flowers around a tomb and said prayers for the estimated 1.5 million Armenians who were killed in the events beginning in 1915 known as Metz Yeghern.Kioudjian said for as long as he can remember his late father, whose parents were killed in the genocide and grew up in an orphanage, took him to memorials and demonstrations every April 24. That was the day in 1915 when Ottoman authorities began arresting Armenian intellectuals and community leaders in Constantinople, now known as Istanbul.“The day April 24 comes around, tears flowed from his eyes, from his heart. It was that sad,” he said.Outside the Turkish consulate in Beverly Hills, several thousand people blocked off Wilshire Boulevard, the main artery through the city, to demand that Turkey recognize as genocide the events that began 106 years ago. The demonstrators waved the national flag of Armenia and called for reparations.Taleen Nazarian, 22, said at the rally that activists like herself have built their identities around fighting for recognition.“We feel this passion to continue the fight for justice ... and do everything we can to pass it down to the next generation," she said.She said she was gratified by Biden's proclamation.“It's still surreal that the day we've been fighting for finally came,” she said.Can Oguz, consul general of Turkey in Los Angeles, said his country vehemently rejects Biden's statement.“None of the conditions defined by the international law have been met that would warrant the use of ‘genocide’ concerning the events of 1915,” Oguz said in a email. "Today’s statement will hurt our bilateral relations and undermine dialogue efforts for peace and stability in the region.”The White House had avoided using using the term genocide for decades for fear of alienating Turkey, a NATO ally and important power in the Middle East. Biden followed through on a campaign promise to make human rights a central guidepost of his foreign policy. He argued last year that failing to call the atrocities against the Armenian people a genocide would pave the way for future mass atrocities.“Today is an historic and emotional day for the Armenian people, including members of my own family who are descendants of genocide survivors,” state Sen. Andreas Borgeas, a Republican from Fresno, said in a statement. "After more than a century, the United States has mustered the courage to acknowledge the truth despite the potential political consequences with the Republic of Turkey.”Rep. Adam Schiff, a Democrat from Los Angeles, praised Biden for following through on his pledge.“This is a momentous day for thousands upon thousands of my Armenian American constituents who have been working, advocating, and praying for recognition for their entire lives – and I am heartened that this announcement comes at a time when there are still some genocide survivors alive to witness it, though their numbers are very small," he said in a statement.The survivors, many of them orphans who were brought to the United States, were recognized by California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who proclaimed Saturday a “day of remembrance of the Armenian genocide."“Forced to build new lives in all corners of the globe, Armenians bravely forged ahead in the face of unimaginable tragedy. Thousands made their homes in California, and we are greater for their contributions,” the proclamation states. “Today and every day, let us recommit ourselves to making certain that we never forget the Armenian Genocide, and that we always speak out against hatred and atrocities anywhere they occur.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/armenian-americans-celebrate-us-president-biden-s-recognition-of-genocide-101619309685065.html

25-04-2021||World||In Mexico, Remembrance Bears help Covid-19 victims' families||The human and psychological toll of the coronavirus pandemic hit home for Mexico City clothing designer Irma de la Parra in January, with the death of a longtime friend from Covid-19.Mexican hospitals usually don’t let family members visit their dying relatives, because of tightly packed hospital wards, a shortage of personal protective equipment and fear of spreading the infection.After her experience, she learned of many families who had never been able to say one last word, or give one last hug, to friends and relatives. So she decided to make a way for them to give endless hugs.“We were overwhelmed with sadness because we knew him (her and her husband's friend) since we were very young, and he was a very good person,” De la Parra said of Martín Elizalde, 53, who died Jan. 10. “I said, how is it possible that none of us, not even his family, could see him again?”That's when the idea of Remembrance Bears was born. De la Parra had long worked making uniforms for daycare centers, so she had the necessary skills and equipment. She decided to make teddy bears out of the clothes of Covid-19 victims so the families could have something tactile to remember people who never got a last hug.The bears are “so that relatives could have something to remember these people who have gone.”Relatives send clothing items the victims often wore before they got ill, and De la Parra carefully cuts out the pattern for the teddy bear’s outer ‘skin’, and then stuffs them.She estimates she has now made about 300 Remembrance Bears.It’s hard, because each bear must be hand sewn and filled with stuffing, and takes about three days to complete. Some of the clothing sent in by relatives is so worn that De la Parra has to sew linings into the bears so they don’t burst. She said she doesn’t look to really make a profit on the bears, charging about $10 apiece.“When we deliver the bears, oh, people are so happy,” De la Parra said. “I feel it is a way to heal their pain a little, because they take them with so much affection.”It has changed De la Parra, who lost most of her income early in the pandemic because the daycare workers and other customers who used to buy clothes and uniforms from her stopped coming in.“My first experience with the pandemic was the economic impact, because we didn’t know many people yet who had gotten sick,” she said. “But as time went on we realized how many people around us were getting sick.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-mexico-remembrance-bears-help-covid-19-victims-families-101619307436019.html

The focus, it said, should be on containment, clinical management, community engagement and vaccination. The existing infrastructure may not be able to cope with this kind of surge, it stressed.“Prompt and targeted action needs to be focused on specific districts/cities/areas in order to flatten the current curve of the epidemic which may be identified by States,” the government said in a statement as it defined the parameters. It said intensive action must be taken in well-defined geographies with more than 10% positivity or 60% bed occupancy and local containment must be imposed for 14 days to break the chain of transmission. “Classification of districts requiring intensive action and local containment is also to be undertaken by the State on a weekly basis and may also be made available online, besides being given due publicity in the media… The local containment will essentially focus on three strategic areas of intervention, which include Containment, Clinical Management and Community Engagement,” it said.Also read | ‘No reason why states must complain now’: Vardhan’s clarification on vaccinationThe Centre also suggested that states, after the identification of areas for intensive and local containment, should appoint nodal officers for 14 days for effective monitoring and implementation in consultation with district collectors and municipal commissioners. “The State Nodal Officer should submit details of all such areas identified for local containment to state government for approval … the District Collector/Municipal Commissioner should undertake a daily status review, including analyzing details of case trajectory, day to day operational planning, implementation of various activities as per the field level feedback.”The daily status report should be submitted to the state government and a consolidated report may also be sent to the Centre. “If required, all States may also consider a further graded response in accordance with local situation, requirements, and resources,” it said.Also read | 500 oxygen bed Covid care hospital in Delhi to start from Monday“Focus will be on containment as a major approach to flatten the current curve of the epidemic… Districts will continue with the strategy of 'Test-Track-Treat-Vaccinate and implementation of Covid Appropriate Behavior across the district as the ongoing strategy for the management of COVID-19,” the Centre said.

Hence, under the able guidance of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, we decided to ease the vaccination policy norms.”Shared idealism is the need of the hour !Politics around the world’s #LargestVaccineDrive needs to end, for the sake of our citizens.Here’s clarifying all aspects of upcoming phase 3 of our #Covid19Vaccination drive, putting all speculations to rest.https://t.co/RsdBUrkmMe pic.twitter.com/Mjoku3Bt4YHis statement comes against the backdrop of the prices of vaccines notified by Serum Institute of India and Bharat Biotech at which they will sell the jabs to states and private hospitals. In this phase, the government has allowed all citizens above the age of 18 years to get vaccinated. While the vaccine manufacturers would supply 50% of their monthly Central Drugs Laboratory (CDL) released doses to the government, which the Centre will provide to people for free, and would be free to supply the remaining 50% doses to state governments and in the open market, according to a health ministry statement.Follow latest updates on Covid-19 here The Serum Institute of India has set the price of its vaccine Covishield at ₹400 per dose for states and ₹600 for private hospitals. Bharat Biotech, on the other hand, said it would charge ₹600 per dose from states and ₹1200 from private hospitals for Covaxin.Harsh Vardhan clarified, “The Centre will continue giving vaccine doses from its 50% quota to the states and UTS for free. These vaccines shall continue to be administered by States and Union Territories...balance 50 per cent quota grants flexibility for states. Many states had requested that the vaccination process be opened up for them. Now, this balance 50% quota shall give them the freedom to vaccinate groups that they deem as priority.”The balance 50% quota is also open for the corporate and private sector to pool in their resources so that the combined effort of Team India can be deployed to vaccinate every adult in the earliest possible time, he added.On concerns flagged by several state governments, Harsh Vardhan said, “I see no reason why the states must complain now. They were demanding the removal of restrictions on vaccine supplies to them. Under the new policy, they have the liberty to directly procure from the manufacturers and even negotiate prices based on volumes. This will also cut the delays. I empathise with the states because they are leading this battle from the front and need fast replenishment of vaccine stocks. They need to decide when, how, how much and to whom. This is exactly what the Centre has done by easing the process.”Amid criticism by some political parties, the health minister appealed to them to put the success of the vaccination program above everything else, so that people’s lives can be saved.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-reason-why-states-must-complain-now-harsh-vardhan-s-clarification-on-phase-3-covid-19-vaccination-101619365675733.html

The death toll increased to 1,92,311 with a record 2,767 daily new fatalities, according to the Union Health Ministry data.Passenger travel from India to Bangladesh via land will remain closed from Monday for 14 days, Momen told reporters here."The decision was taken in view of the rapid increase of coronavirus cases in India...We are closing the land routes for passengers for the time being," he said.The minister, however, said the trade between the two countries would continue.There would be no ban on the movement of cargo vehicles, Momen said.Air travel between India and Bangladesh has already been suspended since April 14 with the rise in infections.Home Minister Asaduzzamman Khan Kamal also said that the authorities have decided to close the borders with India for two weeks."The land routes with India will be shut from April 26," he said.Bangladesh's National Technical Advisory Committee (NTAC) on Covid-19 had earlier suggested border closure with India in view of the surging number of coronavirus cases. It had also suggested that the land routes should not reopen until there is an improvement in the coronavirus situation in India.Bangladesh and India share land borders in West Bengal and the northeastern states of Assam, Tripura, Mizoram and Meghalaya.Meanwhile, Bangladeshi health officials said the nationwide Covid-19 death toll reached 11,058 on Sunday with 101 more people succumbing to the disease in the last 24 hours.Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS) in a statement said 2,922 new infections were recorded overnight, taking the total tally to 7,45,322 in the country.Bangladesh is currently under lockdown. Health officials have expressed concern that the proposed relaxation of the restrictions on movement from April 28, two weeks before the Eid-ul-Fitr, could deteriorate the coronavirus situation in the country.Road transport minister and ruling Awami League general secretary Obaidul Quader has warned that the government would be forced to reimpose strict lockdown if people do not follow guidelines once the public transport services are resumed after the end of the ongoing two-week lockdown.In a related development, DGHS officials said the vaccine shortage has prompted them to stop administering the first dose of the jab procured from India's Serum Institute."We have stopped the first dose of vaccination considering our stock," a DGHS spokesman told reporters, but added that the second dose of the vaccination would continue.DGHS Director General Abul Bashar Mohammad Khurshid Alam said Bangladesh will get 21 lakh more doses of Covid-19 vaccine by the first week of May. Most of those doses would come from India's Serum Institute, he said."We'll also get vaccines from China as a gift. The Covid-19 National Technical Advisory Committee will take the decision on how those will be administered," Alam said.Earlier this week, Foreign Minister Momen said Russia has proposed co-production of its Sputnik vaccine in Bangladesh plants. However, nothing has been finalised as yet.On Chinese vaccines, he said Bangladesh earlier did not show much interest about Chinese vaccine as they were yet to get approval from the World Health Organisation (WHO).“But now, we are keeping all options open to get vaccines,” Momen said.Bangladesh has purchased 30 million doses of India-made vaccine under a tripartite memorandum of understanding (MoU) signed on November 5 and a subsequent agreement on December 13 between the Bangladesh government, Beximco Pharmaceuticals Ltd (BPL) and the Serum Institute.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bangladesh-closes-land-borders-with-india-for-14-days-amid-spike-in-covid-19-cases-101619361950063.html

Union home secretary Ajay Kumar Bhalla said in the statement on Sunday that “no exception is allowed to any industry with regard to use of liquid oxygen.”Also read | Don’t panic and stock oxygen, Remdesivir at home: AIIMS chief to Covid patientsThe Centre tweaked its previous order that exempted nine categories of industries from diverting liquid oxygen for medical use and said these industries will no longer continue to do so. The nine industrial sectors were pharmaceuticals, petroleum refineries, steel plants, ampoules and vials, nuclear energy establishments, oxygen cylinder manufacturers, waste water treatment plants, food and water purification and process industries which require uninterrupted running of furnaces. All other industrial units were told to consider alternative measures such as import of oxygen or setting up Air Separator Units (ASUs) for generation of oxygen for their captive requirements.The government also said on Sunday it has directed all major ports to waive all charges for ships carrying oxygen and related equipment amid a massive surge in coronavirus infections across the country. The ministry of ports, shipping and waterways said it has directed all major ports to accord the highest priority in the berthing sequence to the vessels carrying consignments of medical grade oxygen, oxygen tanks, oxygen bottles, portable oxygen generators and oxygen concentrators.Also read | ‘Glaring lapses...’: Parliamentary committee report flagged concerns over oxygen supply last yearThe government has also exempted customs duty on medical-grade oxygen, oxygen related equipment and Covid-19 vaccines till July 31, 2021.

Among other steps, planes of the Indian Air Force (IAF) brought in cryogenic oxygen tanks from Singapore and also transported them to several parts of the country to reduce travel time.The MHA’s latest order on oxygen comes on a day India reported a record daily rise of 349,691 new infections and 2767 deaths, which have pushed the tally to 16.96 million and death toll to 192,311.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-restricts-use-of-liquid-oxygen-for-only-medical-purposes-101619360752627.html

Remdesivir is not a magic bullet and is given only to patients who are hospitalised, have moderate to severe disease and whose oxygen saturation is below 93... Don't misuse oxygen and Remdesivir.

You will back to normal and get well within seven or 10 days. You don't need to put Remdesivir or oxygen in your house," he asserted.The AIIMS chief said that only 10%-15% may witness severe infection and may need extra medicines like Remdesivir, oxygen or plasma. “Less than 5% of patients need to be operated on a ventilator,” he added, during the live session, which was aired on news agency ANI.Earlier in the day, Prime Minister Narendra Modi also made similar suggestions and cautioned people against falling prey to rumours regarding Covid-19 treatment as well as vaccination. “I appeal to you all to seek information on Covid-19 from reliable sources only. I am seeing many doctors have taken to social media to share information on Covid-19 and are also offering consultations," he said while addressing the 76th episode of his monthly radio programme Mann Ki Baat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dont-panic-and-stock-oxygen-remdesivir-at-home-aiims-chief-to-covid-patients-101619356555797.html

All you need to know||Bharat Biotech International Limited has sought the Drugs Controller General of India’s (DGCI’s) permission to extend the shelf life of its Covaxin, India’s indigenous Covid-19 vaccine, to 24 months. The vaccine, which the company has said will be sold for ₹600 to state governments and for ₹1200 to private hospitals, currently has a shelf life of six months.What is a vaccine shelf life?Shelf life is the expiration date of a vaccine, the time frame within which it retains the same characteristics it possessed at the time of its manufacturing. In other words, shelf life denotes the length of time for which any item remains fit for use.Why does shelf life matter?Longer shelf life is necessary for vaccine manufacturers since they stockpile vaccines to be used over a period of time. It ensures that the vaccine is safe and of sound quality. The World Health Organization (WHO) acknowledges that the stability of vaccines has a major impact on the success of immunisation programmes worldwide.Who can extend shelf life of vaccines?WHO has given the power of assuring vaccine quality to national regulatory agencies like DGCI. “As part of its efforts to assure vaccine quality, WHO has acknowledged the importance of clearly defining the stability characteristics of a vaccine and emphasizes the role of national regulatory authorities in overall vaccine evaluation,” says the WHO guidelines on stability evaluation of vaccines.Has DGCI extended the shelf life before?DGCI, earlier in February, granted approval to Serum Institute of India (SII), the manufacturer of Covishield, for an extension of the vaccine’s shelf life from six months to nine months. WHO, however, rejected SII’s application for the extension of Covishield’s shelf life, citing the lack of sufficient data, Reuters reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bharat-biotech-seeks-extension-of-covaxin-s-shelf-life-all-you-need-to-know-101619356706872.html

On Saturday, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal sent an urgent SOS to chief ministers of all states, requesting them to send to the national capital whatever surplus oxygen and tankers that they could spare.With Delhi’s daily oxygen allocation being 480MT, Kejriwal has said that the city currently requires about 700MT, given the massive surge in fresh Covid-19 cases -- the national capital has been reporting nearly or over 25,000 cases every day for the past one week at least.Facing acute shortage of oxygen supply due to the rising number of Covid 19 cases, more states are seeking railways’ assistance for delivering Liquid Medical Oxygen (LMO) via ‘Oxygen Express’ trains. The national carrier has planned more Oxygen Express trains to Andhra Pradesh, UP, Maharashtra, Telangana, Delhi and MP in the coming weeks.The first Oxygen Express train departed from Mumbai to Vizag on April 19. From April 22 to 24, four trains have also operated from Lucknow to Bokaro and back, the railways said adding that it has delivered around 150 MT of Liquid Medical Oxygen so far. Each tanker has a capacity of around 15-16 MT.The Indian Railways last week decided to deploy the first-of-a-kind ‘Oxygen Express’ trains over the next few days to transport Liquid Medical Oxygen (LMO) and Oxygen cylinders in bulk along key corridors, amid high demand from states grappling with a deadly second wave of Covid-19 cases.With several states reporting a shortage of oxygen, the government last week directed them to ensure uninterrupted movement of medical oxygen carrying vehicles along their borders and said they must not impose any curbs on production and supply of the essential public health commodity anywhere.A meeting was held between Railway Board officials and state transport commissioners and representatives of the industry on April 17 on issues related to transportation of liquid medical oxygen.The railway ministry last week also approved the transportation of liquid medical oxygen in cryogenic tankers under its Roll on-Roll off model as a special case following a request from the Maharashtra government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/1st-oxygen-express-to-delhi-to-depart-from-chhattisgarh-amid-severe-shortage-in-capital-101619350446587.html

It controls 41 ordnance factories engaged in the production of tanks, armoured personnel carriers, bombs, rockets, artillery guns, anti-aircraft guns, parachutes, small arms and clothing for soldiers.State-run plane-maker Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) has started work on setting up a 250-bed Covid hospital in Lucknow, with the facility expected to be functional in early May, the ministry added, detailing steps being that are being taken by the DPSUs and the OFB to help state governments deal with the deadly second wave of the pandemic.HAL has already set up two Covid facilities in Bengaluru with 250 and 180 beds each. It will now focus on providing more ventilators and oxygen points in Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh and Bengaluru, Karnataka. It has also operationalised a 70-bed facility in Odisha’s Koraput and a 40-bed hospital in Maharashtra’s Nasik. The DPSUs are fast-tracking the procurement of oxygen plants for state government hospitals under their corporate social responsibility (CSR) scheme. These include Bharat Dynamics Limited (BDL), BEML Limited, HAL, Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders Limited (MDL), Garden Reach Shipbuilders & Engineers (GRSE) Limited and MIDHANI.On Saturday, defence minister Rajnath Singh said the armed forces and the defence ministry “will leave no stone unturned in providing all possible assistance to the civilian administration.”The DRDO is among the organisations that are at the forefront of fighting the pandemic that has ripped through the country.

25-04-2021||India||‘Glaring lapses...’: Parliamentary committee report flagged concerns over oxygen supply last year||As India struggles with the availability of hospital beds and medical oxygen amid the Covid-19 crisis, a parliamentary committee headed by Professor Ram Gopal Yadav had flagged the much-needed measures in November last year to avoid the unprecedented situation that India is facing.“The Committee appreciates the measures but also observes that there have been few glaring lapses in the battle against pandemic like shortage of emergency supplies, red-tapism, shortage and quality of testing kits, delay in domestic production etc,” the report titled ‘The Outbreak of Pandemic Covid-19 and its management’ read.Regarding the oxygen availability in the country, the committee had noted that the overall production in the country was roughly 6,900 metric ton every day out of which, the highest consumption of medical oxygen was reported in mid-September when the usage was almost 3,000 metric ton of oxygen in one day.On 16th October last year, the secretary, department of health and family welfare, had informed the Committee that the oxygen used in pre-Covid days was just 1000 ton and the remaining 6,000 were used for industrial purposes. The committee, therefore, felt that “there is a strong need to ensure that the oxygen inventory is in place” for hospitals and “oxygen prices are controlled”.It had also appealed to the National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority to take appropriate measures to cap the price of the oxygen cylinders, “so that the availability, as well as affordability of the oxygen cylinders, is ensured across all hospitals for medical consumption”.“The Committee recommends the Government for encouraging adequate production of oxygen for ensuring its supply as per demand in the hospitals,” the report stated, besides urging the government to produce more vaccines and collaborate with maximum vaccine producers on a large scale to make more vaccines available, given the potential rise in the cases.With regard to the availability of beds, the committee had called it a “crucial aspect of the pandemic”, observing that ‘the total number of government hospital beds in the country was grossly inadequate keeping in view the rising incidence of Covid-19 cases”.“As the numbers of cases were on the rise, a frantic search for vacant hospital beds became quite harrowing. Instances of patients being turned away from overburdened hospitals due to lack of vacant beds became the new normal. The scenario of patients holding oxygen cylinders rushing from pillar to post in search of a bed in AIIMS Patna is a testimony to the fact that they tear apart humanity. The Committee is aggrieved at the poor state of the healthcare system and therefore, recommends the government to increase the investment in public health and take appropriate steps to decentralize the healthcare services/facilities in the country” the report read.While seeking a “convincing response” from the government on the issue, the committee said that it “fails to comprehend the underutilisation of the available resources especially at a time when people struggled to find a bed in the hospitals.”The committee comprising of nine Rajya Sabha members, including senior leaders like AK Antony, Suresh Prabhu, Santanu Sen, Subramanian Swamy, mentioned that 3,914 Covid facilities were developed in the country with 39,820 ICU beds and 1,42,415 oxygen supported beds along with 20,047 ventilators. It had, however, said that there was more to be done to ‘mitigate’ the upcoming crisis because of “super spreading forthcoming festive events in the country and advent of the winter season”.“The Committee observes that after a steady increase in the number of Covid cases across the country, there has been a downtrend in Covid cases. However, the Committee strongly feels that the threat of Covid-19 is still looming large on the country keeping in view the second and third wave in European countries and spike in Delhi,” it had warned.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/glaring-lapses-parliamentary-committee-report-flagged-concerns-over-oxygen-supply-last-year-101619340185983.html

25-04-2021||India||Delhi HC suspends ED’s look out circular against alleged arms dealer Sudhir Choudhrie||Sudhir Choudhrie, an alleged arms dealer who is under the Enforcement Directorate (ED) scanner in its money laundering probe against London-based engine-maker Rolls-Royce Plc, was apprehended at Delhi airport last month based on a Look Out Circular (LOC) issued by the agency but the Delhi High Court on Thursday suspended the notice, people familiar with the development said. Advocate Abhimanyu Bhandari, appearing for Choudhrie, informed the court of Justice Pratibha M Singh at Delhi High Court that his client was apprehended even though he is not a named accused in the case and “no summons were issued to him earlier”. Seeking suspension of the LOC against him, Bhandari said “Choudhrie frequently visits India, on an average of two-three months in a year, for various purposes and has deep roots in India. He also has movable and immovable assets in India. The LOC was issued against (by ED) without any case.” He sought permission for Choudhrie to travel abroad to London or the USA to consult his doctors “owing to the Covid-19 pandemic in India and his precarious medical condition as no hospital is willing to admit him as he is likely to contract Covid-19.” ED’s special prosecutor Amit Mahajan opposed suspending the LOC saying “there are several allegations against Choudhrie”. The High Court, however, suspended the LOC issued by the ED and reprimanded the agency for making Choudhrie and his wife sit the whole night at the airport on March 21. “….authorities ought to be mindful of the medical condition and age of parties who are apprehended at the airport due to LOCs being issued in their name before such a treatment is meted out to them,” Justice Singh said in the order, reviewed by HT. An email sent to ED seeking comments remained unanswered. Rolls Royce didn’t offer any comments on Saturday. Choudhrie, 73, a British citizen, is a known arms dealer, who has been under agencies radar in the past for dodgy defence deals but agencies have not been able to gather enough evidence against him. He had been earlier investigated for alleged payment of bribes in securing a contract for an upgrade of artillery guns for an Israel-based defence firm in 2004 and in Barak missile scandal in 2006-07. However, both the cases were closed by the CBI due to lack of evidence. UK’s Serious Fraud Office (SFO) had also launched a probe against him but it had met the same fate. People familiar with the development said Choudhrie was stopped at IGI Airport on the intervening night of March 21 and March 22 upon his arrival here from London on the basis of a LOC issued at the behest of ED and was summoned to the agency office the next morning. To be sure, Choudhrie has not been arrested. The anti-money laundering probe agency opened a LOC against him after in its case against Rolls-Royce Plc. and its subsidiary Rolls-Royce India Private Limited, registered in August 2019, for making dubious payments in the form of commissions in return for contracts from three state-run Indian companies. ED’s probe is based on a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) case in which it is alleged Rolls-Royce made payments in several tranches to a Singapore based middleman between 2007 and 2011 in bank accounts in Singapore and Hong Kong.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-hc-suspends-ed-s-look-our-circular-against-alleged-arms-dealer-sudhir-choudhrie-101619332445454.html

Mumbai's Dr Shashank Joshi, who was the first on a call with PM Modi, said though the second wave of the pandemic is more threatening, there is nothing to panic about as the recovery rate in this phase is also high."The second wave came very fast. It is spreading faster. But the recovery rate is also faster. In this phase, young people and children are also being infected. Symptoms are more or less similar. About 80 to 90 per cent of people do not have any symptom. There is no need to worry about mutations. The way we change our clothes, viruses too change the colour and get mutated," Dr Joshi said.Mann Ki Baat: PM urges citizens to not fall prey to rumours surrounding vaccine"People are starting clinical treatment late because they are thinking the symptoms will go away on their own. Also, reliance on WhatsApp forwards is growing," Dr Joshi said explaining the three stages of Covid — mild, moderate and severe.Watch: ‘Don't chase costly medicines': Doctor’s Covid advice on PM Modi's Mann Ki BaatHe also said there is no need to rush after Remdesivir as it is an experimental medicine, which may reduce one's stay in hospital."I urge all of you if you want any information, to seek information from the right source. Contact your family doctor, doctors nearby, you should contact them by phone, many of our doctors are also taking this responsibility themselves," PM Modi said.In his Mann ki Baat, the Prime Minister interacted with several frontline workers, which included Dr naved from Srinagar, Sister Bhawna Dhruv from Raipur, Sister Surekha from Bengaluru, ambulance driver Prem Verma and Covid survivor Preeti Chaturvedi from Gurugram.On people getting positive after vaccination, Dr Naved said, "It is possible to get infected even after vaccination. But the severity will be much less.""No vaccines provide 100 per cent immunity against Covid-19 instantly. It takes time to build immunity. Please stay at home, don't touch your mouth and nose, drink kadha," Sister Surekha said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dont-panic-don-t-rush-after-remdesivir-docs-say-during-pm-modi-s-mann-ki-baat-101619330430396.html

But do you know how does it work? Take a look! #IndiaFightsCorona pic.twitter.com/YAToaH8hIq> The reading may fluctuate. Wait for it to be stable. Keep the oximeter in place for at least a minute or longer if the reading is not stable.> Record the highest result once it has not changed for five seconds.> Identify each recording carefully.> Start recording from baseline and record three times a day at the same time.Oxygen level monitoring is crucial for patients being treated at home as the baseline saturation should not be below 94 per cent. According to experts, if it is below 94 per cent, hospital admission may be required on the advice of the doctor. Covid-19 patients have also been asked to take a 6-minute walk test in which one should check the oxygen level before and after six minutes of walking inside the room. If there is a fluctuation of 4 per cent or more, then hospital admission may be required.For better oxygenation at home, the Centre has also asked Covid-19 patients ti try self proning where one has to lie face down with the support of 4-5 pillows.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/record-oxygen-level-thrice-a-day-centre-issues-8-step-guideline-for-covid-patients-on-use-of-oximeter-101619324581080.html

"I am showing you a trick. You can do this. This is the nebuliser. This is the machine where we put the medicine. But don't use any medicine. Use the empty nebuliser. Sit down. Put it on your nose and switch on the machine. There is enough oxygen in the environment. Don't rush after oxygen cylinders. Don't put your life at stake. Stay at home. Thank you," Dr Alok can be seen saying as he demonstrates the entire process.Nebulisers are machines to inhale medication but no medicine is needed here, the video said.The video demonstrating a purported technique that can substitute a nebulizer machine for an oxygen cylinder to improve blood oxygen levels is totally baseless. It should be discredited."The video demonstrating a purported technique that can substitute a nebulizer machine for an oxygen cylinder to improve blood oxygen levels is totally baseless.

The registration process will begin on April 28. This is the first time that state governments and private hospitals will independently procure the vaccines and administer them at a fixed charge per dose. As of now, Covishield, the vaccine developed by Oxford University in collaboration with AstraZeneca and manufactured in India by Pune's Serum Institute of India and Bharat Biotech's Covaxin will be available. Later on, imported, fully ready-to-use vaccines will also be available in the open market.Covaxin to cost ₹600 for states, ₹1,200 for private hospitals: Bharat BiotechBefore deciding which Covid-19 vaccine to take, here is all you need to know about these vaccines:EfficacyBoth the vaccines comprise two doses. Covishield has an overall efficacy pf 70 per cent, but it can be over 90 per cent when administered as a half dose followed by a full dose a month later.Covaxin has shown the efficacy of 78 per cent in the second interim analysis and 100 per cent efficacy against 'severe Covid-19 disease'.PriceCovishield will be given at ₹400 per dose to states and ₹600 per dose to private hospitals. Covaxin, on the other hand, will cost ₹600 per dose for the states and ₹1,200 per dose for private hospitals. But how much will you have to pay?> In Central government hospitals, all vaccinations will remain free.> The prices that have been announced are for state governments and private hospitals to buy. The price for end-users will depend on whether the hospitals impose any additional service charge.On Covishield price row, Centre says it will procure vaccines at ₹150 per dose> If you are getting vaccinated at state government hospitals, the price may go down as well in case the state subsidises the price. Some state governments including Madhya Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Kerala, Goa, Chhattisgarh, Kerala, Uttar Pradesh, Assam, Sikkim, West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, have announced that vaccination will be free.> This price range is only for people in the age group between 18 and 44 years. Vaccination of healthcare workers, frontline workers and people above the age group of 45 years will continue as before.Will those who justified the COVISHIELD prices of ₹400 and 600 also justify the COVAXIN prices of ₹600 and 1200 announced today?Is the open-market price of vaccines the highest in India?The prices fixed for private hospitals in India — ₹600 and ₹1,200 — are claimed to be the highest in the world. While Bharat Biotech has not addressed the price issue and said recovering the cost is essential, Serum Institute CEO Adar Poonawalla said the comparison between the price in India and elsewhere is unfair.When should you take the second dose?If you are getting Covaxin, then the second dose should be taken within four to six weeks. If you are getting Covishield, the second dose should be taken in four to eight weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covaxin-vs-covishield-open-market-price-efficacy-second-dose-timing-101619316091524.html

25-04-2021||India||Will continue to provide Covid-19 vaccines free to states: Centre||The Centre on Saturday directed states to coordinate with local law-and-order authorities for effective crowd management at Covid-19 vaccination centres (CVCs) as there is a strong likelihood of people turning up in large numbers to get the coronavirus vaccines, with the immunisation drive widening to all adults from May 1. The health ministry also said the government’s procurement price of both the Covid-19 vaccines remains ₹150 per dose and the Centre will continue to provide them free to states.“There is a possibility of overcrowding that would need to be managed effectively. The states have been asked to keep this in mind as we start vaccinating all above 18 years of age,” a senior central government official said on condition of anonymity.The Centre has also asked states to encourage online-only registrations among the eligible beneficiaries.In a tweet, the health ministry said: “It is clarified that Govt of India’s procurement price for both #COVID19 vaccines remains ₹150 per dose. GOI procured doses will continue to be provided TOTALLY FREE to States.”On April 19, the Centre announced that it will open up Covid-19 vaccination for everyone 18 years and above from May 1 as part of a liberalised and accelerated phase 3 strategy of Covid-19 vaccination in the country. The decision was taken at a high-level meeting chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan and RS Sharma, chairman, empowered group on technology and data management to combat Covid-19, chaired a high-level meeting with all states and Union territories on Saturday.The aim of the meeting was to guide them on effective implementation of the new vaccination strategy (Phase 3), and to review their augmentation plans so as to strengthen the existing hospital and clinical treatment infrastructure for Covid-19 patients, according to the Union health ministry.They also directed states to register additional private CVCs in mission mode by engaging with private hospitals, hospitals of industrial establishments, industry associations. They also emphasised on coordinating with designated appropriate authority for setting up mechanisms for applications or requests, and their processing and also monitoring of pendency of registration.The states will also have to monitor the number of hospitals that have procured vaccines and have declared stocks and prices on CoWIN platform, which is the backbone of the Covid-19 vaccination delivery mechanism, and ensure that the eligible population is provided adequate visibility of vaccination slots on the the platform.The states were assured that the CoWIN platform is equipped to handle the high load of beneficiaries, and that the stakeholders will have to ensure that accurate and timely relevant data is fed into the system.“…CoWIN platform has now stabilized and is working at scale flawlessly. It is equipped to handle the complexities of the new phase of vaccination starting from 1st May,” said the health ministry in a statement issued on Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-continue-to-provide-covid-19-vaccines-free-to-states-centre-101619290141270.html
25-04-2021||India||Covishield most affordable Covid vaccine in market today, says Adar Poonawalla||Addressing the debate over the pricing of the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine locally manufactured under the brand name Covishield, Serum Institute of India’s chief executive officer Adar Poonawalla said on Saturday that comparing global vaccine prices with India was “inaccurate comparison”.“Government procurement for countrywide immunization programs in all countries including India has been at a far lower price as the volumes are very large. For instance, based on the market conditions, prices of many vaccines in the private market including our pneumococcal vaccine are sold at a higher free-economy price, whereas for the government it is almost 1/3rd of the free market price,” he said.SII was selling Covishield to the government of India at ₹150 per dose, and recently announced its prices for state governments, and private hospitals and institutions, which are ₹400 and ₹600 per dose respectively. SII was criticised for keeping the per-dose price of Covishield higher in the Indian market than the global market.“Furthermore, there was an inaccurate comparison done between the global prices of the vaccine with India. COVISHIELD is the most affordable COVID-19 vaccine available in the market today. The initial prices were kept very low globally as it was based on advance funding given by those countries for at-risk vaccine manufacturing. The initial supply price of COVISHIELD for all government immunization programme, including India, has been the lowest,” he added.Poonawalla also said that the current situation was extremely dire as the virus was constantly mutating, which meant that the public remained at risk.“Identifying the uncertainty, we have to ensure sustainability as we must be able to invest in scaling up and expanding our capacity to fight the pandemic and save lives,” he said, and adding that only a limited portion of SII’s volume will be sold to private hospitals at ₹600 per dose.“The price of the vaccine is still lower than a lot of other medical treatment and essentials required to treat COVID-19 and other life-threatening disease. Furthermore, in the interest of public health, it is important for the market to open-up for other vaccines from across the world. This will accelerate and advance the immunization program of our country. We hope this lay to rest the confusion for which we are happy to in a fully transparent manner explain our various pricing policies,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covishield-most-affordable-covid-vaccine-in-market-today-says-serum-ceo-adar-poonawalla-101619290081308.html
25-04-2021||India||Govt scraps cess on oxygen to ramp up supply||The Union government on Saturday scrapped basic customs duty and health cess on oxygen and oxygen-related equipment until further orders to ramp up supply, as hospitals continued to battle scarcity amid a devastating surge in Covid infections in the country.Prime Minister Narendra Modi chaired a high-level meet on ramping up oxygen supply in which decisions on waiving off the duties were taken. Covid vaccines too would be exempt from basic customs duty, it was decided.“The Prime Minister chaired a meeting to review steps taken to boost oxygen availability in the country. The PM emphasised that there was an immediate need to augment the supply of medical-grade oxygen as well as equipment required for patient care both at home and in hospitals,” an official statement read.The statement said the government had decided to grant full exemption from basic customs duty and health cess on import of oxygen and related gear for three months.The scrapping on related import duties will ease imports and make imported oxygen and related medical equipment cheaper, measures likely to boost availability.The PM stressed all ministries and departments need to work in synergy to increase availability of oxygen and medical supplies, according to the statement.Basic customs duty on remdesivir, a drug recommended for use to treat Covid-19 in certain in-hospital cases, and its active pharmaceutical ingredients has already been waived off.In the meeting chaired by the PM, there were discussions on speeding up import of equipment related to providing oxygen, which could result in more easing of import regulations related to medical use of oxygen.Shortage of medical oxygen paralysed Covid treatment in major hospitals in Delhi and other cities for the third day on Saturday. Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Friday said the capital’s requirement of oxygen stood at 700 MT, while only about 400 MT was available, while the capital’s quota was enhanced to 480 MT.In order to augment production and availability and meet rising demand, the PM-chaired meet decided to grant full exemption from basic customs duty and health cess on import of a range of medical equipment and gear, including medical-grade oxygen, oxygen concentrators along with flow meters, regulators, connectors and tubing vacuum pressure swing absorption units.Any other device from which oxygen can be generated will also enjoy these waivers.The PM has directed the revenue department to ensure seamless and quick custom clearance of such equipment.The department of revenue has named Gaurav Masaldan, joint secretary, customs, as the nodal officer for issues related to customs clearance for the oxygen and oxygen-related gear, the official statement added.The official statement said a host of administrative and other measures had been taken to boost oxygen availability, as doctors sounded alarm over dwindling stocks to treat critical patients.“IAF planes are bringing in cryogenic oxygen tanks from Singapore. IAF is also transporting oxygen tanks in the country to reduce travel times. Similarly, in a major decision yesterday, free food grains will be given to 80 crore Indians for the months of May & June 2021,” the statement said.Those who participated the meet chaired by the PM were the finance minister, the commerce and industry minister, the health minister, the principal secretary to the PM, member NITI Aayog, Dr Randeep Guleria of AIIMS, and the secretaries of the departments of revenue and health apart from a host of other officials.Commerce minister Piyush Goyal separately tweeted that customs clearances for Covid-19 related imports will be fast-tracked. “In another step towards fighting COVID-19, Customs will expedite clearances for import consignments relating to the pandemic to ensure critical equipment and medicine can reach on time,” the tweet said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-scraps-cess-on-oxygen-to-ramp-up-supply-101619290021275.html
25-04-2021||India||Bharat Biotech announces Covaxin prices: ₹600 per dose for states||Bharat Biotech said on Saturday that it will sell its Covid-19 vaccine Covaxin to state governments at ₹600 per dose, while it will supply the vaccine directly to private hospitals at rs 1,200 per dose, an announcement that came days after the Serum Institute of India released the pricing of Covishield ahead of the widening of the immunisation drive against the infectious disease to cover all adults from May 1.Covaxin was developed by the Hyderabad-based firm in collaboration with the Indian Council of Medical Research and the National Institute of Virology. It is one of the two vaccines that are currently deployed in India’s vaccination drive, which was launched on January 16.“Bharat Biotech is honoured to develop, manufacture and supply Covaxin for India’s vaccine roll out at ₹150 per dose, which is distributed for free by the government of India. We would like to state that more than 50% of our capacities have been reserved for central government supplies. Following the directive of the government of India, we announce the price of Covaxin: ₹600- state governments; ₹1200- private hospitals; and exports- $15-$20…,” Bharat Biotech said in a statement.The second interim Phase 3 analysis of the first make-in-India Covid-19 vaccine, Covaxin, has shown 78% efficacy, its maker has said. The company first released its preliminary Phase 3 analysis results in March, showing 81% efficacy based on 43 cases. In this round, a vaccine efficacy of 78% was recorded against mild, moderate, and severe symptoms of Covid-19 based on 127 cases.“Covaxin is an inactivated and highly purified vaccine, making manufacturing expensive due to very low process yields. All costs towards product development, manufacturing facilities, and clinical trials were deployed primarily using internal funding and resources of Bharat Biotech,” said Krishna Ella, chairman and managing director, Bharat Biotech.“Recovering costs is essential in the journey of innovation towards other vaccines such as intranasal Covid-19, Chikungunya, Zika, Cholera and others. Our core mission for the last 25 years has been to provide affordable, yet world-class health care solutions for the globe,” he added.Bharat Biotech’s price announcement came after the Centre announced on April 19 that the vaccination drive would be opened up to all adults and that vaccine manufacturers were allowed to supply 50% of their monthly doses to the central government, and the remaining 50% doses to state governments and in the open market at pre-decided prices.India currently has two Covid-19 vaccines in use for the national Covid-19 immunisation porgarmme: Covaxin and Covishield. Covaxin is co-developed by Bharat Biotech and ICMR, and the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is locally manufactured by the Serum Institute of India under the brand name Covishield.On Friday, SII announced that it will sell Covishield to state governments at ₹400, and to private hospitals at ₹600.“This (Covaxin price) is probably much higher compared to what they announced in local media in the initial stages. Even though I am not an expert on cost of vaccines, I hope the governments have been consulted before deciding on this high a price,” said Dr Giridhara Babu, head, epidemiology, Indian Institute of Public Health.Bharat Biotech currently manufactures about 10 million doses of Covaxin each month, and is looking at manufacturing scale-up in a stepwise manner across multiple facilities at Hyderabad and Bengaluru.With the help of the central government, the company is working towards ramping up the production capacity by at least 100% by May-June, 2021, with a target of producing nearly 100 million doses per month by September 2021.The company is exploring manufacturing partnerships with partners in other countries, who have prior expertise with commercial scale manufacture of inactivated viral vaccines under biosafety containment. To further increase capacities, Bharat Biotech has partnered with Indian Immunologicals (IIL) to manufacture the drug substance for Covaxin.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bharat-biotech-announces-covaxin-prices-600-per-dose-for-states-1-200-for-private-hospitals-101619289961332.html
25-04-2021||India||At least 10 killed in avalanche in U’khand’s Chamoli district||An avalanche in the Sumna area of Chamoli district in Uttarakhand killed at least 10 people and injured several on Friday evening, according to the state government officials.The location of the snow avalanche near the Indo-China border is mainly uninhabited but Border Road Organisation personnel working there have been affected. Around 384 persons have been rescued from the spot. This part of Uttarakhand has been recording heavy snowfall for the past 4 to 5 days, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD).“An active western disturbance was passing over the region and it brought both rainfall and heavy snowfall in the upper reaches of the western Himalayas including Uttarakhand. We do not track avalanches or landslides, so information on how the disaster occurred is not there with us,” said M Mohapatra, director general, IMD.Local officials couldn’t confirm if the disaster was caused by an avalanche or a glacier breach.“The scientists can confirm this. From what we have understood, it’s a glacier breach and landslide,” said Swati Bhadouriya, district magistrate, Chamoli.“The number of dead may increase. There were around 450 workers working there, out of that 384 have been rescued and 7 have been airlifted and hospitalised. Rescue operations are underway but roads are blocked from Malari onwards due to heavy snowfall for the past few days. Many rescue teams are not able to reach the location,” said RS Negi, information officer, Chamoli.The avalanche occurred less than 100km from Raini village which was affected by a glacier breach on February 7. A glacier breach triggered an avalanche and deadly floods in Uttarakhand’s Chamoli district on February 7, which killed at least 72 people and destroyed two hydroelectric projects.The Rishi Ganga Hydropower Project (13.2 MW) near Raini village was the first to be hit by the debris after the rockslide. The unfinished Tapovan Vishnugad Hydropower Project (520 MW), 8km downstream from Rishi Ganga Hydropower Project, was the second hydropower plant hit by the flood where most of the deaths occurred.Kathmandu-based International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD) has underlined the link between the February 7 glacier breach disaster in Uttarakhand’s Rishi Ganga river with infrastructure development, particularly the construction of hydropower projects in the higher reaches of the Himalayas.A senior official of the Snow and Avalanche Study Establishment (SASE) under Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) said their team hasn’t managed to reach the location because of a blocked road. The team will assess the exact reasons behind the disaster.The western disturbance as a cyclonic circulation which is lying over north-eastern parts of Ladakh and its neighbourhood has started moving away north-eastwards. Under its influence, isolated rainfall/snowfall is very likely over Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand on Saturday. A fresh feeble western disturbance likely to affect Western Himalayan region from April 27 causing isolated rainfall/snowfall with thunderstorms and gusty winds over Jammu, Kashmir, Ladakh, Gilgit, Baltistan, Muzaffarabad, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand during April 27 to 30.A north-south trough (area of low pressure) is running from Marathwada to south coastal Tamil Nadu across north interior Karnataka, Telangana and Rayalaseema. Under its influence, scattered to fairly widespread rainfall/thunderstorm activity is very likely over Kerala and Mahe and isolated scattered rainfall/thunderstorm over remaining parts of south Peninsular India during next 4-5 days. Strong surface winds (speed reaching 20-30 kmph) are likely over Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi and north Rajasthan on April 25 and 26.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/at-least-10-killed-in-avalanche-in-u-khand-s-chamoli-district-101619289721288.html
25-04-2021||India||Delhi HC suspends ED’s look out circular against arms dealer Choudhrie||Sudhir Choudhrie, the alleged arms dealer who is under the Enforcement Directorate’s (ED) scanner in its money laundering probe against London-based engine-maker Rolls-Royce Plc, was apprehended at Delhi airport last month on the basis of a Look Out Circular (LOC) issued by the agency but the Delhi high court on Thursday suspended the notice, people familiar with the development said.Choudhrie, 73, a British citizen, has been on various agencies’ radar in the past for dodgy defence deals but they have not been able to gather enough evidence against him.He had earlier been investigated for alleged payment of bribes in securing a contract for an upgrade of artillery guns for an Israel-based defence firm in 2004 and in the Barak missile scandal in 2006-07. However, both the cases were closed by the CBI (Central Bureau of Investigation) for lack to evidence. The UK’s Serious Fraud Office (SFO) had also launched a probe against him but it met the same fate.People familiar with the development said Choudhrie was stopped at IGI Airport on the intervening night of March 21 and March 22 upon his arrival here from London on the basis of the LOC and was summoned to the ED office the next morning. To be sure, Choudhrie has not been arrested.The anti-money laundering probe agency opened an LOC against him in its case against Rolls-Royce Plc and its subsidiary Rolls-Royce India Private Limited, registered in August 2019, for making dubious payments in the form of commissions in return for contracts from three state-run Indian companies.ED’s probe is based on a CBI case in which it is alleged that Rolls-Royce made payments in several tranches to a Singapore-based middleman between 2007 and 2011 in bank accounts in Singapore and Hong Kong.Advocate Abhimanyu Bhandari, appearing for Choudhrie, informed justice Pratibha M Singh at the Delhi high court that his client was apprehended even though he is not a named accused in the case and “no summons were issued to him earlier”.Seeking suspension of the LOC against him, Bhandari said, “Choudhrie frequently visits India, on an average of two-three months in a year, for various purposes and has deep roots in India. He also has movable and immovable assets in India. The LOC was issued against him (by ED) without any case.”He sought permission for Choudhrie to travel abroad to London or the US to consult his doctors “owing to the Covid-19 pandemic in India and his precarious medical condition as no hospital is willing to admit him as he is likely to contract Covid-19”.ED’s special prosecutor Amit Mahajan opposed suspending the LOC, saying “there are several allegations against Choudhrie”.The high court, however, suspended the LOC issued by ED and reprimanded the agency for making Choudhrie and his wife sit the whole night at the airport on March 21. “...authorities ought to be mindful of the medical condition and age of parties who are apprehended at the airport due to LOCs being issued in their name, before such a treatment is meted out to them,” justice Singh said in the order, reviewed by HT.An email sent to ED seeking comments remained unanswered.Rolls Royce didn’t offer any comments on Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-hc-suspends-ed-s-look-out-circular-against-arms-dealer-choudhrie-101619289661274.html
25-04-2021||India||Govt orders removal of posts on Covid-19, terms it ‘inflammatory content’||The Centre issued orders to take down over 100 “inflammatory” posts and accounts across Twitter, Facebook and Instagram related to Covid-19, including an official Facebook page of Trinamool Congress chief Mamata Banerjee, officials familiar with the matter said on Saturday, as cases of the infectious disease continued to surge across the country.“Covid related posts that showed photos of cremations that were incendiary, inflammatory messages that could incite the public and lead to assaults on healthcare personnel are among those that have been blocked,” a government official familiar with the developments said on condition of anonymity.HT learns that the Mamata Banerjee Facebook page under scrutiny was “Banglar Gorbo Mamata”, which has over 2.7 million followers and is a verified account. HT could access the page until late evening and could not independently verify whether the admin had received a notice from Facebook.Other affected accounts included those of Congress MP Revanth Reddy, TMC’s Moloy Ghatak, a West Bengal state minister, two filmmakers, Vinod Kapri and Avinash Das, and Mamata Banerjee Supporters (FAM) on Twitter. Flagged posts by these accounts have been blocked by Twitter in India. Facebook declined to comment on the matter.The emergency blocking orders, under Section 69(A) of the Information Technology Act, were issued by the ministry of electronics and information technology on Friday and the full order came into force on Saturday. “A Mamata Banerjee election handle is also part of the blocking orders,” the official quoted above said. “All orders have been issued as they constitute content misinformation.”Of the over 100 blocking orders, 52 have been received by Twitter, a person familiar with the matter said, adding that Twitter has complied with the orders and has withheld the specific posts in the country, while the accounts continue to be functional. The company is considering the further course of action, the person added.A Twitter spokesperson clarified that the company complies on the receipt of a valid legal request and disclosures of the blocking are made on Lumen. “When we receive a valid legal request, we review it under both the Twitter Rules and local law. If the content violates Twitter rules the content will be removed from the service. If it is determined to be illegal in a particular jurisdiction, but not in violation of the Twitter rules, we may withhold access to the content in India only,” the spokesperson said.TMC Rajya Sabha MP Derek O’Brien severely criticized the government’s move. “MO-SHA are fascists. We have been saying that for a while. Losers cannot handle criticism,” he said. “Why are we all getting angry that they blocked Twitter accounts. They block oxygen from gasping citizens.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-orders-removal-of-posts-on-covid-19-terms-it-inflammatory-content-101619289601923.html
25-04-2021||India||6 patients die at Punjab hospital due to oxygen shortage, CM orders probe||Six critically ill patients died at a private hospital in Punjab’s Amritsar due to a shortage of oxygen on Saturday morning. The hospital authorities blamed the district administration for the first such incident in Punjab, saying they prioritised government hospitals in ensuring oxygen supply, amid the second Covid-19 wave that has led to a surge in infections and overwhelmed hospitals. Chief minister Amarinder Singh ordered the Amritsar deputy commissioner (DC) to initiate a thorough probe into the incident.The wave has sparked a shortage of critical supplies such as oxygen and medicines. Oxygen is a critical medical intervention against Covid-19, which causes respiratory distress in some cases. The pandemic has accelerated the global demand for it.“The district administration bought oxygen cylinders from suppliers for government hospitals. It is responsible for the [oxygen] shortage in private hospitals,” said Sunil Devgan, the managing director of Neelkanth Hospital, where the six died. He added they had informed the families of the patients about the limited stock of oxygen. “We urged them to shift their patients to another hospital, but they declined the option.”Amritsar deputy commissioner Gurpreet Singh Khaira said they held a meeting with owners of private hospitals on Friday about the oxygen supply and that is when the Neelkanth authorities informed them about the shortage. “We told private hospitals not to admit any critical patient or those who need oxygen if they have shortage as we could arrange only a few cylinders for GMCH [Government Medical College Hospital], where more patients are admitted. Private hospitals are responsible for arranging the required number of [oxygen] cylinders. If Neelkanth Hospital was short of supply, they should have referred the patients to other hospitals,” he said.“Due to the shortage of [oxygen] cylinders in the district [Amritsar], oxygen supply at Neelkanth Hospital dried up this morning, resulting in the death of six patients on the spot. Of the dead, two were from Gurdaspur district, one from Tarn Taran, and three from Amritsar district. All six patients were in a critical condition when they were admitted to the hospital on Thursday.”Amritsar civil surgeon Charanjit Singh promised an inquiry and said they will ensure no such incident happens in the future.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/6-patients-die-at-punjab-hospital-due-to-oxygen-shortage-cm-orders-probe-101619289421338.html

The hospital was running short of oxygen supply and was left with only 1.5 hours oxygen in its gas plant when the tanker arrived, police said.DCP (Shahdara) R Sathiyasundaram said around 9.45am, the police received a message followed by a call from a government-appointed nodal officer to transport an oxygen tanker from a production plant in Modinagar. “We contacted senior UP police officers. The details of the tanker and its driver were shared and we immediately dispatched our team to get the oxygen tank transported here,” said the DCP.In another such effort, the north district police came to the rescue of Sant Parmanand hospital by providing 71 oxygen cylinders. Similarly, in the southeast district, police helped IBS hospital in Lajpat Nagar get oxygen cylinders and saved the lives of 40 Covid-19 patients.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/timely-police-action-averts-oxygen-crisis-at-three-hospitals-101619289222764.html
25-04-2021||India||Centre extends tax resolution scheme ‘Vivad se Vishwas’||The Centre on Saturday extended the deadline for making payments under tax dispute settlement scheme ‘Vivad se Vishwas’ (from dispute to trust) from April 30 to June 30 to provide relief to taxpayers facing a public health crisis due to the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic.The earlier deadlines of April 30 for various other compliances such as income-tax assessment or reassessment orders and notice for reopening of cases where income has escaped assessment have also been extended by two months, a Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) order said.“The deadlines have been extended in view of the severe Covid-19 pandemic raging unabated across the country affecting the lives of our people, and in view of requests received from taxpayers, tax consultants and other stakeholders that various time barring dates, which were earlier extended to April 30, 2021 by various notifications may be further extended,” a finance ministry spokesperson said.The extended time limit will also be applicable for passing an order related to any directive of the Dispute Resolution Panel (DRP) and for sending intimation to process of equalisation levy (EL), he said. EL is imposed on non-resident e-commerce firms that mop up revenue from the Indian market without paying any taxes.It has also been decided that the time for payment of amount payable under ‘Vivad se Vishwas’ scheme without any additional amount shall be further extended to June 30, 2021, he said.Tax amnesty scheme ‘Vivad se Vishwas’ is one of the most successful direct tax dispute resolution schemes, which settled more than 148,000 vexed cases and recovered 54% of about ₹1 lakh crore amount under litigation. The scheme that was enacted on March 17, 2020, closed on March 31 this year. However, taxpayers who had already made declarations within the stipulated deadline of March 31, can make payment without any additional amount or penalty up to June 30.According to official data, the government received a total 133,837 applications under the scheme that involved total 148,690 disputes – 145,237 related to appeals by assesses and 3,453 related to appeals by the income-tax department. While the total disputed amount was ₹1,00,437 crore, the government received ₹54,005 crore payments against the disputed tax.The ‘Vivad se Vishwas’ scheme provides for settlement of disputed tax, disputed interest, disputed penalty or disputed fees in relation to an assessment or reassessment order. It grants immunity to taxpayers from levy of interest, penalty and institution of any proceeding for prosecution for any offence under the Income-Tax Act in respect of matters covered in the declaration.Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced the scheme in the Union budget presented on February 1, 2020. It aimed to resolve legacy disputes involving direct taxes. Under the scheme, penalty and interest would be waived if the disputed amount is paid before the stipulated date. As on January 31, 2020, there were over 5.10 lakh litigations pending in various forums involving over ₹19.5 lakh crore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-extends-tax-resolution-scheme-vivad-se-vishwas-101619289241310.html

He is the first judge from the Andhra Pradesh high court to become CJI.At the farewell of justice Bobde on Friday, justice Ramana had paid his tribute to all those who have lost their lives due to the Covid-19 pandemic and implored the people to exercise utmost caution against the spread of the infection.“We are going through testing times. The country as a whole is battling the severest second Covid wave. The virus does not make any distinction. During these unprecedented times, some strong measures are necessary to break the cycle. I request everyone to cooperate in implementing these measures,” he said.“We can defeat this pandemic together with discipline, dedication and cooperation with each other and with authorities. My heart goes out to everyone who has lost their loved ones due to this virus... We are undoubtedly living in hard times. However, I believe that these circumstances will compel us to emerge stronger than ever before. Let us be strong and overcome this together,” justice Ramana had asserted.Justice Ramana was born to a family of farmers at Ponnavaram village in Andhra Pradesh’s Krishna district. He fought for civil liberties during the Emergency and lost an academic year. He also participated in the Jai Andhra movement for a separate Andhra state in the 1970s because of alleged injustices meted out to the people of the coastal and Rayalaseema regions. Vice-President M Venkaiah Naidu was among the other proponents of the movement.Justice Ramana worked as a journalist from 1979 to 1980 and reported on political and legal matters for the Eenadu newspaper. He enrolled as an advocate in 1983 and specialised in constitutional, criminal, service, and interstate river laws at the Andhra Pradesh high court. He was appointed as a permanent judge of the high court in 2000. Justice Ramana was elevated as chief justice of the Delhi high court in 2013 and to the Supreme Court a year later.He is seen as a conventional judge, who is restrained in his speech. He is known to talk less and for clarity of thought in his orders and judgments and adhering to the principle of judicial discipline and the rule of precedent.Justice Ramana has been a part of several landmark judgments, underscoring constitutional rights, democratic values, and accountability. In his judgments in the cases of Anuradha Bhasin and the Foundation for Media Professionals, he ruled that access to the internet is a fundamental right by extension while pulling the government up for the telecommunications blackout in Jammu & Kashmir after the nullification of the region’s semi-autonomous status. The judgments also laid down certain parameters on curfews. They held that Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code, which bans assembly of over five people, cannot be used to suppress the legitimate expression of opinion or grievance or exercise of democratic rights.Similarly, as part of a five-judge bench in Subash Chandra Agarwal’s case, justice Ramana emphasised that the right to information and right to privacy are on an equal footing. In Swaraj Abhiyan vs Union of India, he stressed the need for cooperative federalism in the implementation of the National Food Security Act.Justice Ramana delivered the 2019 verdict related to the Karnataka assembly, clarifying the legal position that disqualification under the Tenth Schedule for defection could not operate as a bar for contesting elections again. Simultaneously, he lamented “a growing trend of the Speaker acting against the constitutional duty of being neutral” and implored presiding officers to check horse-trading and corrupt practices associated with defection and change of loyalty for the lure of office or other wrong reasons.In the Shiv Sena vs Union of India case, justice Ramana followed the precedent of ordering an immediate floor test in the Maharashtra assembly to prevent horse-trading in 2019. In another significant case, a bench that included him, passed directives to expedite criminal investigations and trials involving lawmakers.Justice Ramana in January ordered fixing a notional income for non-earning homemakers in insurance claim cases. He called this a step towards the constitutional vision of social equality and ensuring the dignity of life for all individuals. In a case involving an accused with mental illness facing the gallows, he wrote: “The right to dignity of an accused does not dry out with the judges’ ink, rather, it subsists well beyond the prison gates and operates until his last breath.”Not a single judge was appointed to the top court during justice Bobde’s 14-month tenure as the CJI. All eyes will be on the new CJI to fill up the current vacancies of six judges in the Supreme Court. Justices Rohinton F Nariman, Ashok Bhushan, and Navin Sinha are also due to retire by the end of 2021. Four more judges of the top court will retire before justice Ramana demits office. There will be 13 vacancies in the Supreme Court during justice Ramana’s tenure. The apex court currently has just one woman out of the sanctioned strength of 34 judges.Meanwhile, vacancies of high court judges have also risen to 411 out of 1,080. The new CJI will have to streamline the appointment process as the pendency in the high courts has gone beyond five million cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/justice-ramana-takes-oath-as-cji-101619289181293.html
25-04-2021||India||Maharashtra, Rajasthan and MP next in IAF’s plan of carrying oxygen||The Indian Air Force (IAF) will on Sunday carry out the next round of sorties to transport oxygen to Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh as the country is grappling with the unprecedented surge in cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) during the second wave of the pandemic, aggravated by the shortage of the gas needed to treat critically ill patients, a senior military official said on Saturday. The air force’s transport aircraft have already ferried large oxygen containers to filling stations in different parts of the country, including Panagarh in West Bengal to Jamnagar in Gujarat.A C-17 Globemaster III transport aircraft flew to Pune in Maharashtra and then to Gujarat’s Jamnagar carrying four oxygen container trucks, according to the senior military official aware of the developments. The aircraft was used to carry two empty containers from Rajasthan’s Jodhpur to Jamnagar and deployed from Indore in Madhya Pradesh to Jamnagar. The IAF aircraft also flew empty oxygen containers from Hindon airbase and Madhya Pradesh’s Bhopal to Jharkhand’s capital city of Ranchi. An An-32 transport aircraft took Covid testing equipment from Jammu to Kargil and from Jammu to Kargil on Saturday. In the morning, a C-17 flew from the Hindon to Singapore’s Changi International Airport and returned to Panagarh with four cryogenic oxygen containers.Also read | IAF intensifies efforts for relief as govt asks military to render maximum helpThe Union home ministry on April 22 directed all states and Union territories to treat oxygen vehicles like ambulances and make provision for green corridors to ensure uninterrupted transport of medical oxygen across the country.“The issue is not about hospitals, it is a shortage of beds for severely affected cases needing oxygen support. In fact, most positive cases do not need hospitalisation. There are many positive cases moving about freely and only when they get tested as positive their near and dear ones push them to hospitals to avoid spread at home. It is a case of palming off responsibility. Hospitals, therefore, are getting burdened with cases that otherwise can be managed at home. In some cases family members are not coming back to hospitals to take patients who have recovered,” the official mentioned above said.Also read | PPCR arranges 250 ventilators, 4,000 oxygen concentrators from SingaporeThe official also said that filling of oxygen from manufacturers in Haridwar, Panipat, Dehradun and other areas in north India is time-consuming because of traffic obstruction further complicated by blocks established on approaches to Delhi. “The IAF is airlifting empty oxygen trucks to Panagarh where these are refilled at Durgapur and then moved by rail to various destinations. Filled trucks cannot be airlifted because these trucks carry oxygen under pressurised conditions. IAF has also transported oxygen trucks from Singapore,” the official added.The Centre is also looking at lifting oxygen tankers from the United Arab Emirates (UAE) apart from Singapore. Defence minister Rajnath Singh said on Saturday the armed forces and the defence ministry “will leave no stone unturned in providing all possible assistance to the civilian administration”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-rajasthan-and-mp-next-in-iaf-s-plan-of-carrying-oxygen-101619286738999.html
25-04-2021||India||CBI files case against Anil Deshmukh on corruption charges||The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Saturday booked former Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh under the Prevention of Corruption Act and Indian Penal Code’s section 120 B (criminal conspiracy) over a month after ex-Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh accused him of running an extortion racket. It conducted a preliminary inquiry on the Bombay high court’s directions before registering a First Information Report (FIR) against Deshmukh and “unknown others”.People familiar with the matter said the FIR was registered for further probe into the allegations after the CBI’s initial inquiry found “prima facie” evidence against Deshmukh, who resigned hours after the high court order on April 5. They added senior officers and the CBI’s legal team reviewed the findings of the inquiry before giving the go-ahead for the FIR.The FIR against Deshmukh, who did not respond to repeated calls and text messages for comments, coincided with raids at four places in Mumbai. Deshmukh’s residence was among the places searched.Singh wrote a letter to Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray in March and alleged Deshmukh had asked suspended assistant police inspector Sachin Vaze to collect ₹100 crore monthly from bars, restaurants, hotels, and other sources in Mumbai. The letter was written after Singh was transferred for allegedly mismanaging the bomb scare outside industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s house in February. Vaze has been arrested in connection with the discovery of the explosives-laden car outside the house and the alleged murder of the man, Mansukh Hiran, linked to the vehicle.Deshmukh, a leader of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), and the Shiv Sena-led Maharashtra government sought to brazen out the issue initially as Singh approached the Supreme Court seeking a CBI investigation into the alleged extortion racket. The top court refused to intervene and said Singh could approach the high court. Deshmukh resigned citing moral grounds after the high court asked the CBI to conduct the preliminary inquiry within 15 days and left it to the discretion of the agency’s director to decide the further course of action.NCP spokesman and state minister Nawab Malik called the action being taken in the alleged extortion racket case as politically motivated. “...Deshmukh has been cooperating with the investigating agency and will continue to do so in the future too. But the investigation by the Central agency is on allegations levelled by the former police commissioner of Mumbai [Singh] who himself is under the scanner in the Antilia [Ambani residence] explosive case. We firmly believe that the judiciary will do its job and the truth will come to the fore.”HT this week reported the CBI’s preliminary probe was delayed due to the complex nature of the investigation, the federal agency’s internal mechanism of reviewing a case at various levels, and unforeseen delays due to a surge in Covid-19 cases. The agency did not want to rush its probe though it had recorded the statements of most of the key people.A CBI team led by police superintendent Abhishek Dular over the last two weeks recorded statements including those of Deshmukh, his two personal assistants, Sanjeev Palande, and Kundan Shinde, and Singh. It scrutinised financial documents, statements of witnesses, and people arrested by the National Investigation Agency during its probes into the bomb scare conspiracy and Mansukh Hiran murder cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cbi-files-case-against-former-maharashtra-home-minister-anil-deshmukh-on-corruption-charges-101619239079359.html

25-04-2021||India||PM Modi chairs meets on infra crisis as cases, deaths soar||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday urged all states to come together and work as one nation to ensure there is no scarcity of resources to arrest the second wave of Covid-19 that has triggered a deluge of infections, overwhelmed hospitals, and sparked a critical shortage of oxygen and medicines.In his meeting with chief ministers of 11 worst-hit states and Union territories, Modi said the central government was working to increase oxygen production and ensure seamless supply across states. He asked states to ensure widespread testing and vaccination and crackdown on black marketeering and hording of medicines and medical oxygen.“The biggest basis of India’s success during the first wave of the pandemic was our united effort and united strategy… we will have to address this challenge in the same way,” he said in the virtual meeting.“If we work as one nation, there will not be any scarcity of resources,” he added.The meeting came on a day India posted its highest number of infections and deaths, at 345,159 and 2,622, respectively, straining further the country’s health infrastructure already burdened with the world’s worst outbreak.The surge has left India devastated. Across the country, desperate patients are begging authorities for non-existent beds and hospitals are putting up SOS messages on social media with hours left for their oxygen supply to run out. Relatives of people who died of the disease are forming long queues outside makeshift crematoriums and graveyards that are running out of wood and space, with workers often working through the night. The ominous siren of ambulances has become a part of the soundscape of major cities.Later in the day, Modi also met leading oxygen manufacturers and told them that this time was not only to deal with challenges, but also to provide solutions in a very short time. The PM stressed on the need to maintain good coordination between the government and the oxygen producers and spoke about utilising the full potential of the industry.Modi also held an internal review meeting on the overall Covid-19 situation in the morning.Chief ministers of some states asked the Prime Minister to help with removing hurdles in the supply of oxygen and medicines, and demanded that the price of vaccines to be used in phase 3 of the inoculation drive from May 1, when it opens up to all adults, should not cost more than earlier phases, when vaccine manufacturers supplied shots to the Centre at a subsidised price.At the meeting, Modi also stressed on the importance of vaccination, which, experts say, is crucial in taming the ferocious surge in infections. He said that India was running the world’s largest vaccination programme and the Centre had provided 150 million doses free of cost to the states. He stressed on the importance of stepping up the drive from May 1, when it opens to all adults. Currently, only those above 45 can get vaccinated.“Our vaccination programme should not slow down in this situation… we will also need to work in mission mode to get more and more people vaccinated,” he said.PM Modi assured the Centre’s full support to all states and said there was a continuous effort to increase oxygen supply. He urged states to coordinate to fulfil requirements relating to medicines and oxygen, and check hoarding and black marketing of oxygen and medicines.This came amid pitched battles between several states, especially Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and Haryana, over oxygen supply. Delhi government has complained that neighbouring states are stopping tankers from entering the Capital, a charge refuted by the other two states. The Centre on Thursday invoked the Disaster Management Act to ensure unrestricted interstate supply of oxygen.“Every state should ensure that no oxygen tanker, whether it is meant for any state, is stopped or gets stranded,” Modi said.He asked states to set up a high-level co-ordination committee to carry oxygen to different hospitals of the state. “This coordination committee should ensure that as soon as there is allotment of oxygen from the Centre, it can deliver oxygen as per requirement in different hospitals of the state immediately,” he said.Modi said the central government was working on all possible options to reduce the travel and turnaround time of oxygen tankers, including Oxygen Express by the railways and roping in the air force.Modi said added the Union health ministry was monitoring the situation closely.He said that along with upgrading of resources, the country had to focus on testing. His comments came amid complaints of long delays and shortage of kits for testing in several states.“Along with all measures for treatment of the patients, hospital safety is also very important… administrative staff of the hospital needs to be made more aware about the safety protocols,” he said, expressing grief about recent incidents of oxygen leakage and fire at hospitals in Maharashtra. He also urged the administration to make people aware so that they did not indulge in panic buying.At the meeting, Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh said that the new vaccination policy for 18+ people was unfair to the states, and demanded central funding. He said his government adopted all measures to minimise the demand for oxygen and asked the Centre to ensure all commitments as per allocation were complied with by oxygen manufacturers in other states. “This is not happening at present. Punjab’s supplies come from Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand, and there are reports of supplies being ‘hijacked’,” he said.Chhattisgarh chief minister Bhupesh Baghel said he sought information about the quantity of vaccines the state will get from the Centre from May 1. ”We asked how many vaccines will be given to us by the Centre. We also asked that there should be one rate of vaccines for Centre and the states.”Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray demanded additional medical oxygen for the state, adequate supply of vaccines, and permission to import medicines to tackle the surge in Covid-19 cases. He also demanded that oxygen be airlifted if possible, an official release said.Maharashtra requires 1,550 metric tonnes of medical oxygen to treat coronavirus patients every day and about 300 to 350 metric tons is being procured from outside, he said. Instead of distant states, if the supply could be arranged from neighbouring states, it would be available early, he said, according to the statement.Karnataka chief minister BS Yediyurappa urged the Centre to supply 1,471 tonnes of oxygen and 200,000 doses of Remdesivir.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-chairs-meets-on-infra-crisis-as-cases-deaths-101619214887387.html
25-04-2021||Today's||How to win the war against Covid-19||Two million people perished during the bloody birth of our nation. The pandemic has claimed one-tenth of that number already. There is no negating its severity anymore because even the staunchest deniers are sick, dying or cremating their families. Our health infrastructure has already collapsed and we have yet to face subsequent waves as super-spreader melas and rallies start their transmission cycles. India is waging a third world war. And a nation at war cannot afford internal squabbling.What should or could have been done to avoid the situation are passe conversations which can wait. A war requires unity of purpose and participation of citizens. We are facing a much bigger enemy than differences in ideology, religion or political affinity. We will have time enough for the latter if we win the battle against the former. If we don’t, our economy will be in tatters, families will be devastated and we will live a mauled existence for decades. Who will the corporates sell to if their customer base is diminished? How will politicians govern, if the nation is depleted of people? How can the rich live safely when the poor have nothing left to lose?That is why, at this time, there must be a single-minded focus on how we can contribute to the war effort rather than indulge in recrimination.War times require nations to leverage their national capacity. A national war effort is a sum of the constructive energy of every citizen and organisation. This war needs to be fought on fronts other than government operations which perforce deal reactively with the immediate crisis and will always be inadequate. Here are six strategic initiatives which can help the war effort.Bureaucracy must ruthlessly convert peacetime processes to a wartime sense of urgency. Every rule that impedes fluidity must be suspended. Every order passed must be war-gamed through its implications in consultation with stakeholder representatives. These instructions need to be reviewed every 12 hours and tweaked based on ground feedback. An entirely separate set of officers must start planning and catering for impending contingencies like the approaching summer which will trigger power shortages, monsoons that will choke ravaged cities like Mumbai and non-Covid-19 diseases whose toll will start rising exponentially.Large corporates must pitch in with every possible resource they can spare. They should vaccinate all their direct and indirect employees and families, set up medical facilities for them and frontload their corporate social responsibility (CSR) budgets for the next decade right now. The government must allow carrying forward CSR credit with pro-rata incentives. Similarly, corporates should hasten their payment cycles to vendors and employees to inject more spending power into the system. Venture capitalist funds must redirect their focus on equipment and platforms required to fight Covid to spur innovation and scale.Software giants, telecom back-offices, call centres, e-commerce platforms must offer their resources proactively. Business associations and various other trade bodies at all levels must submit assistance for coordination and movement of resources and dissemination of information. Unsold inventory of the real estate sector should be modified into wards or holding areas. The idle capacity of schools and private buses must be commandeered and redeployed for the pandemic. These solutions must be planned in totality and offered as self-contained projects. The government is too overwhelmed to redeploy resources offered piecemeal.Our health and hygiene, police, medical supply chain and ancillary personnel are frontline warriors. Many of them have not been able to cater to their own families over the last few weeks. Resident Welfare Associations and neighbours should take every possible administrative load off them. Frontline staff should be commuted to work instead of having to travel themselves, their children should be looked after and their families helped, so that they can focus on the pandemic. The policemen on duty must be taken care of by us to alleviate exhaustion and fatigue. Hygiene workers should be given cash and food to boost their wherewithal. Every ounce of energy that frontline soldiers divert from the battle, towards their administrative requirements, results in lost lives. Every administrative call they have to attend to is a professional call missed.We need to work the phones with our non-resident Indian (NRI) assets asking for assistance of resources and pressure to be applied on their host countries’ governments. The latter must realise that India is a back-office and industrial base for the world, not just for Indians. Indian diplomats must make the case that a weakened India strengthens Chinese hegemony. We need to call in our IOUs to nations like the United States, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, France and so on who have benefited immensely from their Indian diaspora, and more importantly, need access to Indian markets in the future. Regardless of which parties NRIs support, they are still Indians and their homeland needs them.Our national leaders, irrespective of political affiliation must be pressed into service to leverage their expertise, organisational capabilities and relationships with counterparts, CEOs and industrialists in other countries. This is not unprecedented. Prime minister Narasimha Rao sent Atal Bihari Vajpayee, the then leader of the Opposition to defend India in the United Nations. Rao showed his statesmanship by electing the best man for the job and Vajpayee did India proud. Both fought for India even though they were political adversaries. And that is the spirit we need to win a war.Raghu Raman is founding CEO, NATGRIDThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/how-to-win-the-war-against-covid19-101619358067851.html

We cannot even begin to think that we have won half the battle until at least 70% of the world’s population is vaccinated. But this doesn’t seem possible as things stand now. For India, the situation is particularly grim given the soaring number of cases and the United States (US) placing restrictions on raw materials for vaccine production.The reason why vaccines are not either easily available or affordable to everyone, especially the underprivileged, is because of vaccine nationalism, which is seeing countries buy up vaccines at a rapid rate with many of them now having supplies far above their requirements. The West has focused on “the developing world” largely to exploit cheap labour. When labour became expensive in Europe and the US, a majority of multinational companies from these places turned to China. At that time, the world’s most populous country was desperate to pull itself out of poverty. Despite its avowedly Communist ideology, the proposal by various European countries, under the tutelage of the US, to set up factories in China was welcomed by its leadership. Though communism and capitalism made for strange bedfellows, they proved hugely beneficial to China. Today, it has a significant presence on the world stage and has emerged as a strong challenger to the US in economic terms. The tensions between the US and China are, in the view of some experts, akin to the beginning of a second Cold War. But before this spiralled out of control, the coronavirus, which originated in Wuhan, shattered the world as we know it. It ripped through continents, shutting down businesses, stopping cross-border commerce and putting the brakes on socialising. The lengthy lockdowns slowed down the process of globalisation. The US, the United Kingdom (UK) and other developed nations rushed in to corner the bulk of vaccines for their citizens. According to the British Medical Journal, at the outset of the pandemic, the US booked 800 million doses of the vaccine with six vaccine-manufacturing companies with a provision for a billion more doses. The population of the US is 331.42 million which means that it has far more than its needs. The same is the case with the UK. The Boris Johnson government has made arrangements for five doses per citizen. This is detrimental to poor countries in Africa and developing nations like India. India has a population of 1.4 billion. To vaccinate 70% of its people, it will need as many, if not more, doses than the US has made provisions for. A degree of immunity kicks in only after two doses of the vaccine. Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi’s active initiative has led two companies in Pune and Hyderabad to begin manufacturing the vaccine some months ago. The material required for the Serum Institute of India in Pune to manufacture the vaccine has been restricted by the US. The CEO of the company, Adar Poonawalla, has requested President Joe Biden to lift these restrictions, but so far he has not done so. Hopefully, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Indian government will be able to put enough pressure on the US to make it see reason. Meanwhile, Bharat Biotech has announced that it has increased manufacturing with help from the Centre. This is a positive step, but experts feel it will take months to manufacture the required amount of doses.And it is not just vaccines. Patients need oxygen, hospitals, and ventilators. PM Modi has assured the nation that this is being given top priority. It would have been of great help if the rich countries that benefit from India’s cheap labour had offered a helping hand. WHO predicts that only 37 countries will be able to achieve the desired vaccination goals. We may have to wait till the end of 2022. Vaccine nationalism by rich countries will be counterproductive in the long run. The International Chamber of Commerce has predicted that if developing nations do not receive the required doses of the vaccine, the global economy will suffer losses of up to $9.2 trillion. It will cost around $25 billion to provide enough vaccines to all poor countries. The head of WHO, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, has rightly pointed out that if the poor and middle-income countries do not get vaccines, it will be impossible to bring the global economy back on track. That is why it is in the interest of all nations to ensure the equitable distribution of the vaccine in an interdependent world. The WHO chief’s statement in this regard is pertinent — the priority should be to vaccinate some people in all countries rather than all people in some countries. But will the rich and powerful countries see the wisdom in this?Shashi Shekhar is editor-in-chief, Hindustan The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/vaccine-nationalism-hurts-the-whole-world-101619358008334.html
25-04-2021||Today's||The CCP history revision elevates Xi Jinping to the level of Mao Zedong||Last week, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) revised its history again. Since 1999, the party has made these revisions once every decade, airbrushing out leaders who crossed the line, blanking out certain incidents from public memory and putting its own gloss on major events.The latest version, released earlier this month, was timed to coincide with the 100th year of the party’s founding. This new edition of the party’s history endorses the policies of Xi Jinping, reinforcing other efforts to enhance his image as he prepares to secure a third term at the helm of affairs at the next party Congress in 2022. This is unprecedented as, since 1980, no Chinese leader has held the country’s top positions for a third term.Although indoctrinating entire generations with sanitised versions of events has always been important to authoritarian regimes, this is probably the first time that the party has simultaneously launched a year-long campaign for the nationwide study of its new history.Everyone in the 92-million-strong party, as well as all members of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA), is mandated to study this Brief History of the Communist Party of China. It will also be taught in all schools and universities across the country.The importance of the new history can be gauged from reports, articles and commentaries that appear every day in the People’s Daily, the party’s official newspaper, as well as from the extensive coverage by media. On March 31, before the revision was announced, the party’s leading theoretical fortnightly journal Qiu Shi (Seeking Truth) reproduced a hitherto unpublished speech by Xi on the importance of studying party history. In his speech, delivered on February 20, Xi specifically listed eight important points for study.The Brief History and the study campaign also have political significance. They promote Xi’s image and elevate him to a position at par with Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping, China’s most important Communist leaders. They reinforce the narrative, pushed since 2013, that China under Xi has embarked on another 30-year era like those of Mao and Deng.Among the important differences between the old and new versions is the reduced emphasis on Mao’s era. While the older version had three or four chapters on Mao’s 30-year era, the new edition encapsulates it in only two. Further, the older version extensively examined the decade-long Cultural Revolution -- the period of national turmoil from 1966 – and discussed it in one lengthy 11,000-word chapter, holding Mao responsible for the “serious disaster”.The new version appears to absolve Mao of the Cultural Revolution’s excesses, has shrunk references to it to just one page, and makes no mention of party rectification, the anti-Rightist struggle, the Great Leap Forward, or the overthrow of the Gang of Four. Instead, it says the internal turmoil was not caused by Mao but rather because many of his ideas for building socialism were not thoroughly implemented. In fact, it credits Mao with exploring new ways to fight corruption, special privileges and red tape within the party and the government, indicating its hardening stance under Xi.The new version predictably takes a more hawkish and nationalistic approach to major events, thereby, endorsing Xi’s aggressive foreign policy. Writing on the day of the new history’s release, the Hong Kong-based Apple Daily said that while the older edition emphasised Deng Xiaoping’s low-profile approach to diplomacy, the new version highlights the party’s heightened efforts to deal with western sanctions. It recalls that in November 1989, well after the West imposed sanctions on China following the bloody Tiananmen Square crackdown in June 1989, Deng told then United States (US) president Richard Nixon that the Chinese people would “never beg for the cancellation of the sanctions” even if they dragged on for 100 years.Xi’s bid for a third term may, however, not be without any serious hiccups. The resentments among a wide cross-section of people lingering since last year and exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic, may resurface nearer the party Congress.Jayadeva Ranade is a former additional secretary, Cabinet Secretariat, Government of India, and is presently president of the Centre for China Analysis and StrategyThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/the-ccp-history-revision-elevates-xi-jinping-to-the-level-of-mao-zedong-101619358006936.html
25-04-2021||Editorials||A universal vaccine drive | HT Editorial||For almost two months after India began its coronavirus vaccination drive, infection rates were among the world’s lowest. In this period, vaccine uptake was hampered by widespread hesitancy and many experts, as well as this newspaper, advocated for the government to abandon its tiered strategy. The suggestions were implemented eventually, but not before this devastating wave of infections gathered momentum. India also ignored several indicators that invariably foreshadow the resurgence of an epidemic: The reproduction number of the virus began inching up in mid-February, and the test positivity rate followed three weeks later. These examples underscore a basic approach policymaking needs in a pandemic: Interventions need to be proactive, not reactive.The experiences of other countries explicitly chart out the two paths India could find itself on. It can either go down the route taken by Israel, the United Kingdom (UK) or the United States (US), where life is now returning to normal; or it can follow the path of Brazil, which has some of the highest per capita casualties for a populous country and has turned into a hotbed for dangerous new variants. All of these countries suffered large outbreaks, but the three that turned it around did so with large-scale vaccinations. These examples have been known to our policymakers for some time now and while India’s large population presents tougher challenge than these countries dealt with, the learning is clear: India must make sure the universal vaccination drive it has allowed starting May 1 is a success (and, if possible, should start the process from Monday or Tuesday) .With constraints on eligibility removed, there’s no reason why five million or even 10 million vaccine doses can’t be administered a day. Only this can dam the stream of infections. The process will require addressing the very significant issue of vaccine hesitancy. And it will require the government to expedite sourcing by leveraging domestic industry and any diplomatic goodwill it has among nations that have doses to spare. In tandem, it needs to launch a distribution blitz, which will need to address concerns of how doses will be available to those under 45 years, since that responsibility appears to fall entirely on states that till now were left out of the process. Even though the gains from vaccines could take at least two months to accrue, immediate, rapid universal coverage is the only tool to stop the virus apart from a long-drawn-out lockdown, which, after a tough 2020, is hardly an option at all. India must make sure its universal vaccine drive is a success.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/a-universal-vaccine-drive-hteditorial-101619358069096.html
25-04-2021||Editorials||The US must step up and assist India now | HT Editorial||The silence of the United States (US) leadership, India’s key strategic partner on the global stage, as coronavirus infections surged, did not go unnoticed by many in India. It was all the more conspicuous in the face of expressions of solidarity and offers of help from around the world, even from adversaries such as China and estranged neighbours like Pakistan. By the time US secretary of state Antony Blinken and national security adviser Jake Sullivan tweeted their support for India on Saturday, questions were being asked by commentators in both New Delhi and Washington as to why the US was not doing more to help India. There is also the issue of the Biden administration’s curbs on exports of essential raw materials needed by Indian vaccine manufacturers to ramp up their production. Despite the Indian side taking up this matter with American authorities since February and the Indian foreign minister raising it directly with his US counterpart, the Biden administration has been largely non-committal on easing the export restrictions.To be sure, the US is not the cause of the crisis in India but it is expected that strategic partners will step up and deliver. A speedier expression of solidarity by the US leadership would have had a powerful impact on the Indian people.As things stand, the US leadership appears to have realised that it needs to step up to assist India and we can expect to see a more concerted effort this week. After that, India and the US can move on to the larger task of putting their resources together to help others struggling with the Covid-19 crisis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/the-us-must-step-up-and-assist-india-now-hteditorial-101619358066634.html
