Officials of the Khoda Nagar Palika said all 45,064 houses in the area will be getting their house numbers for the first time.Khari, along with several others, received his permanent house number during an event held on Sunday at the Nagar Palika.He said it will help him shun his previous temporary house number, which was based on his ration card. “Residents of Khoda have been facing issues due to this for the past several decades, as the houses were generally identified on the basis of ration card numbers. So, the word ‘RC’ was prefixed with the temporary house number, which was difficult to find out. Many times, the postman would return, unable to locate recipients. Residents faced problems while opening bank accounts as well, which require permanent house numbers,” Khari said.“In many cases, the cheque books issued from banks would get returned as the delivery man could not locate the house numbers based on ration cards. Even our voter ID cards had the old ration card-based house number. Many a time, anyone not familiar with the area, coming as a guest or for some other work, would also return. People often locate houses by asking locals by way names of residents,” Khari further.Khoda is a densely populated area adjacent to National Highway 9 under the jurisdiction of Ghaziabad district. Most residents are employed in service works, odd-jobs and daily wage earners, a majority of whom are migrants. It is ticked between Ghaziabad, Noida and Delhi.Housing in the area is unplanned, and several constructions do not adhere to building by-laws. Most of the walkways in the city are in the form of congested lanes and by-lanes, while some are so narrow that two persons cannot pass through at once, side by side.KK Bhadana, the executive-officer of the Khoda Nagar Palika, said that the local body came into existence on March 10, 2016. Khoda was formerly an old village, the development of which into a colony took place from the 1980s onwards.“Now, we have started the process and an agency will be serially numbering the houses from 1 to 45,064 in the next three months. This will immensely help local residents. Number plates for the house will also be distributed to residents. Before this, it was difficult to locate houses across the 34 residential wards,” he added. The first house number was allotted to Nagar Palika chairperson, Reena Bhati, and to the 34 elected councillors and four nominated councillors, after which allotment to other residents began. Khari was among the first non-elected residents to get the house number.“The Khoda locality has 73 Mohallas in 34 residential wards and is a small city in itself. The process of allotment of numbers will be done serially and not in groups. When more houses come into existence, they will be issued numbers serially,” Bhadana added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/for-the-first-time-khoda-residents-get-permanent-house-numbers-101618251817820.html
12-04-2021||Noida||10.8K people vaccinated on second day of ‘tika utsav’ in GB Nagar||NOIDA: The second day of tika utsav (vaccination festival) witnessed a better turnout in Gautam Budh Nagar on Monday as a total of 10,787 eligible people got their shots against Covid-19 at different inoculation centres in the district, officials said. On Sunday, 6,553 beneficiaries had been inoculated in the district under the drive. District magistrate Suhas LY said that the district witnessed a very good response from the people for vaccination drive. “Apart from the vaccination drive, we are trying to check the further spread of the viral infection. For that, we are trying to keep a track on infected people and their primary and secondary contacts. Based on the number of active cases, we have declared 193 places, including apartments and societies, as containment zones,” he said. The DM further said that considering the need of isolation and ICU beds, the district administration has given permission to private hospitals to run separate wards for Covid patients at the stipulated rates. “The private hospitals have been divided into two different categories -- National Accreditation Board for Hospitals and Healthcare Providers (NABH)-accredited and non-NABH accredited. And the patients have been categorised in three groups – moderate, severe and very severe. The rates for NABH-accredited hospitals vary from ₹10,000 to ₹18,000 per day, including the cost of PPE kits. For the non-NABH category, the rates vary from ₹8,000 to ₹15,000 per day, including the cost of PPE kits,” he said. Chief medical officer Dr Deepak Ohri said that the package rates will include bed, food, amenities, doctors’ consultation, nursing charges, and all other treatments. “The package will include medical management of underlying co-morbid conditions like hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular illness and chronic pulmonary/kidney/hepatic diseases. This will include emergency management procedure such as acute haemodialysis if needed,” he said. Ohri said that caps have also been put on Covid-19 related pathological tests. “For the RT-PCR test, the maximum rate has been fixed as ₹700, while for the TrueNat and CB-Nat test – it will be not more than ₹2,000,” he said. Giving the details of Monday’s vaccination, additional chief medical officer, Dr Neeraj Tyagi, who is in-charge of vaccination in the district, said that on the second day of this four-day drive, as many as 3,537 senior citizens took their jabs, out of which 1,260 were the second dose recipients. “Besides, 6,945 people aged between 45 and 59 years were vaccinated. The number of left out health care workers and frontline workers, who got their shots today, was 305,” he said. Meanwhile, the district recorded 239 new cases on Monday, which is the highest single day spike this year. According to the state health bulletin, the Covid-19 tally in the district has now mounted to 27,724. The death toll remained at 93 as no fresh fatality due to the infection was reported in the last 24 hours.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/108k-people-vaccinated-on-second-day-of-tika-utsav-in-gb-nagar-101618251757807.html

However, the ground level situation depicts a different picture with official figures indicating that the district had 169 containment zones till April 11 with 519 Covid-19 cases.The areas having positive cases are defined as containment zones where there is a restriction on movement of people, except in case of essential services and emergency situations. The containment zones are created to restrict the spread of infection. However, when asked about the restriction on movement of people in and out of containment zones, the district officials said that the “guidelines are being followed”, but declined to clarify further. “We are creating and clearly demarcating the boundaries of containment zones as per guidelines issued by the government. Testing, surveillance and other activities are also being taken up as per protocol in order to check the spread of infection,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate of Ghaziabad. On Monday, an HT team visited the Carte residential segment having 83 Covid-19 cases (on April 8) and found that some of the houses on the official list of containment zones in Shastri Nagar and Chiranjeev Vihar localities had no demarcation and even no posters were put up at the houses indicating that they have a Covid patient. Notably, on April 8, the district had a total of 532 active cases, as per the data from the Ghaziabad health department. “There is no demarcation in containment zones and there is also no restriction on movement of people. In some cases, health department teams come and put up a red mark at such houses. There are people in my ward who have contracted infection and they often call us to get sanitization done. Also, there is hardly any restriction on movement of patients,” said Rajendra Tyagi, a councillor from Raj Nagar ward 84 and a resident of Chiranjeev Vihar. Till last year, the administration was securing the containment zones by placing at entry/exit points wooden poles or tapes, and the deployment of police and home guards was also ensured. Councillor Ajay Sharma from ward 67 of Sanjay Nagar said that the perimeter of the containment zones is not secured or demarcated in his ward. “My ward has a few Covid-19 cases, but I have not seen any demarcation of the containment zone that is usually done by putting up wooden poles or tapes,” Sharma said. When asked, Shailendra Kumar Singh, additional district magistrate (city), said that in some cases when tapes are put up to define perimeter of containment zones, people often damage them. “We are putting up stickers at houses having Covid cases and regular sanitisation is also taken up. Other guidelines are also getting followed,” said Singh, who is also the nodal officer for containment zones. Experts said that the basic idea of creating a containment zone is to restrict movement. “If there is no restriction in and out of a containment zone, the spread of infection cannot be checked. So, it has to be fully demarcated and movement restricted. But such instances are generally not visible this year,” said Dr Ashish Agarwal, president of Indian Medical Association (Ghaziabad).On April 3, UP chief secretary RK Tiwari issued an order for surveillance in which areas having one positive case was to be created as a containment zone in a radius of 25 metres (comprising about 20 houses), while areas having more than one case will be in form of a cluster and having a radius of 50 metres (comprising about 60 houses). For the high-rises, the directions said that in case of emergence of one Covid case, the entire floor will be contained while in case of multiple cases, the entire tower will be contained.In another order on April 11, the UP chief secretary had directed that the supply of essential commodities should be ensured in all containment zones.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/containment-zones-not-demarcated-ghaziabad-admin-says-all-guidelines-being-followed-101618251638248.html

The court was delivering its verdict on an appeal filed by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) challenging bail granted to peasant activist Akhil Gogoi by an NIA court in October last year. “The dominant intention of the wrongdoer must be to commit a ‘terrorist act’ coming within the ambit of Section 15(1) of the Act,” the court order, delivered on April 9, read. In its order, the HC bench comprising Justice Suman Shyam and Justice Mir Alfaz Ali pointed that subsection (1) (a) of Section 15 of UAPA can be attracted only if an alleged act is in the nature of “terrorist act” and involves the use of bombs, explosive substances and other lethal weapons. “Unlawful act of any other nature, including acts arson and violence aimed at creating civil disturbance and law and order problems, which may be punishable under ordinary law, would not come under the purview of section (1) of the Act unless it is committed with the requisite intention,” it added. The court held that alleged “commissions and omissions” on the part of Gogoi as revealed by materials cannot be prima facie said to be a terrorist act done with the intention of threatening the unity, integrity and sovereignty of India or a terrorist act done with the intention of striking terror among people. The HC held the NIA court was right to grant bail to Gogoi and dismissed the appeal by the investigating agency. Gogoi, who now heads Raijor Dal, a new political party that contested the recently concluded assembly polls in Assam, has been under arrest since December 2019 for allegedly inciting violence during the anti-Citizenship Amendment Act protests. The case against Gogoi was initially lodged in Chabua police station in Dibrugarh district in December 2019 under various sections of the Indian Penal Code for criminal conspiracy, unlawful assembly, rioting etc. Subsequently, sections 15(1) (a)/16 of UAPA were added to it. The trial in the case is yet to commence. The case was later transferred to the NIA the same month and a charge sheet was filed in June last year which alleged that Gogoi led the anti-CAA movement which turned violent and led to arson and attacks on police personnel. It alleged that the peasant leader hatched a conspiracy to target a particular community to disturb the unity and integrity of the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/gauhati-hc-upholds-nia-court-order-granting-bail-to-akhil-gogoi-101618251458350.html
12-04-2021||Gurugram||Faridabad institute roped in to audit accident-prone spots, recommend measures||The Institute of Road Traffic Education (IRTE) from Faridabad has been roped in by the traffic police to audit accident-prone spots in the city and submit a report by May, following which the police will increase enforcement measures and deployment, senior officials said. Sanjeev Balhara, the assistant commissioner of police (traffic), said that the number of accidents reduced in the first quarter of this year, in comparison to the two years preceding it. This year, 63 accidents were reported in January, 61 in February, and 81 in March, while the respective numbers were 86, 87 and 73 last year, and 122, 95 and 101 in 2019. “IRTE will conduct a detailed road safety audit across the city, majorly at spots from where the maximum number of accidents were reported in the last three years, for making it safe,” he said.The police shared a list of identified black spots and reasons for the accidents, as ascertained in multiple surveys and collaborative analysis with other agencies in the city.An intersection or a road is termed as a black spot if more than five deaths are recorded in a 500-metre stretch over a three-year period.The police officials said that the initiative was taken to bring down the number of accidents and fatalities on roads across the city as well as on the Delhi-Gurugram Expressway.The IRTE will submit a detailed action plan for road engineering-related improvements, recommend speed limits and suggest the installation of road marking and signage, coupled with a plan for focused accident prevention through better enforcement and awareness among all categories of road users.KK Rao, the commissioner of police, said that as part of their plan to reduce accidents, they have done away with traffic signals at many spots and instead, diverted traffic for smoother flow. “There are a lot of construction works underway across the city. Many flyovers and underpasses are in the making, which will provide a smooth passage (in the future). By applying speed limits, we are hoping to reduce accidents,” he said.The police said that pedestrian bridges or subways will be constructed at spots where there is a high footfall of pedestrians and cyclists, especially on the Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway and the Southern Peripheral Road. The initiatives will be started at a few locations within a month and subsequently, be extended to multiple points across the city.Balhara said that besides gauging the safety of commuters, the audit will also record commuter behaviours, faulty spaces for overtaking, scientific approaches not being followed, identification of potential black spots and intensifying the enforcement measures to hold road contractors, consultants or concessionaires accountable for faulty road design under Section 198 A of the MV (Amendment) Act. “We have deployed teams on the stretches known to be dangerous spots and have made several changes, including the construction of speed breakers and roundabouts, installation of traffic lights and road markings,” he said.In January and February, police teams visited 12 black spots and found that six did not have functional streetlights. Lack of proper lighting is a major problem on Dwarka Expressway, at Farrukhnagar crossing, Pataudi crossing, Hero Honda Chowk, Sidhrawali crossing and on major stretches in Manesar. Motorists and pedestrians are the worst affected, as most of these stretches where black spots are present don’t have a footpath. Last week, over 25 accidents were reported from six of the identified black spots, said officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/faridabad-institute-roped-in-to-audit-accident-prone-spots-recommend-measures-101618251157651.html
12-04-2021||Gurugram||Mobile vaccination centre flagged off||The district health department on Monday flagged off a mobile Covid-19 vaccination centre, set up in a van, to increase vaccination coverage in slum areas.Dr Amandeep, nodal officer for vaccination (urban areas), Gurugram, said, “In slum areas, we were facing problems in vaccinating people as health centres are not always in close proximity to the localities and reaching out to people was also a little difficult. This mobile van will focus on slum areas and beneficiaries can register on the spot. No fixed time limit has been decided for particular areas, but it will depend on the number of registrations.”The van was flagged off by the chief medical officer from Bhim Colony in Sector 39. On Monday, the van visited Bhim Colony, and the urban primary health centres in Rajendra Park and Nathupur. On Tuesday, it will be available in Subhash Nagar and Tikri village, said officials.However, data on the number of people vaccinated at the mobile session site was not immediately available.The van is equipped with space for a doctor, vaccinator and an attendant. It has facilities of a mini clinic, including a bed, refrigerator to store vaccines and other facilities to deal with any adverse event following vaccination. The van can store up to 100 vials of vaccine, which, can vaccinate up to 600 people, said officials.Dr Virendra Yadav, the chief medical officer, said, “Through this van, we are targeting to vaccinate at least 100 people per day. The van has been launched with the aim of increasing the pace of the Covid-19 vaccination campaign in the district so that the maximum number of people can be covered.”On Monday, 20,060 beneficiaries above the age of 45 were vaccinated at 220 session sites, comprising 160 government sites and 60 private sites. So far, over 349,000 beneficiaries have been vaccinated in Gurugram, according to officials records of the health department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/mobile-vaccination-centre-flagged-off-101618251042167.html

We have repeatedly asked the people not to buy such plots as those are liable to be demolished... There is an apprehension that the property dealers will take advantage of the Covid-19 crisis and try to develop colonies illegally as the authorities are busy in managing the pandemic. We will not allow this to happen,” according to Bhath.Meanwhile, the DTCP is conducting a survey in the outskirts of the city once again, to identify illegal constructions and developments, said the officials. According to Ashish Sharma, assistant town planner, the enforcement team also demolished an illegal shop in Sector 82, and an illegal gate installed on 24 metres road, following complaints by the locals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/dtcp-razes-two-illegal-colonies-in-demolition-drive-in-manesar-101618251041455.html
12-04-2021||Gurugram||Ahead of monsoon, drains to be cleaned in Manesar for the first time||In a first, the Municipal Corporation of Manesar (MCM) has launched a survey to identify points prone to waterlogging, to prepare the town for the monsoon season. The MCM officials will interact with gram panchayats to prepare a strategy for the same.Without any reference or recorded history, the officials of the MCM — which was formed in December 2020 — said that they will rely on gram panchayats for mapping the vulnerable waterlogging points and allocate resources to clean the points on a priority basis.Hariom Attri, joint commissioner, MCM, said, “Last week, a meeting was held with the representatives of various government bodies in Manesar, to take stock of the monsoon preparedness measures. Gram panchayats have in-depth knowledge about the vulnerable waterlogging points in the city, and using their inputs, we want to create a database and map all such areas where desilting and cleaning of drains can be initiated on a priority basis.”Two executive engineers will visit all the 19 gram panchayats in Manesar and conduct a survey to identify the points prone to waterlogging, Attri added.Prior to the formation of the MCM, villages in Manesar were largely looked after by the gram panchayats, and the urban areas by the Haryana State Industrial and Infrastructure Development Corporation (HSIIDC). A few sectors, which share a border with Gurugram, also came under the supervision of the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA).According to the MCM officials, they will have a learning experience this year, and will use the findings to ensure that the city is better prepared to deal with the monsoon in 2022.“One of the main reasons behind the formation of the MCM was to provide a civic body to Manesar, which can upgrade public facilities such as the drainage system in the city. We will use the findings of this monsoon season to identify all the points across the city that are worst-affected by waterlogging and will initiate remedial action before next year’s monsoon to ensure that the minimal amount of rainwater is accumulated,” said Attri.The MCM officials said that tenders will be floated once the survey is completed, to finalise contractors for desilting, using drainage cleanliness machines such as super suction machines, jetting machines, bucket type sewer cleaning machines, and placing tractor-mounted pumps at the vulnerable waterlogging points.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/ahead-of-monsoon-drains-to-be-cleaned-in-manesar-for-the-first-time-101618251040745.html

The suspects have been targeting over 50 factories and robbing raw material worth crores of rupees over the past few years, police said, adding that they had announced a cash reward of ₹5,000 for information leading to their arrest.The district court on August 4, 2020, had declared both the suspects — identified as Mumtaz alias Nanuka, and Babloo, a native of Bareilly in Uttar Pradesh — as proclaimed offenders. They lived in a rented accommodation in Sector 10, according to the police.We received a tip-off from Bareilly on Saturday, following which the crime unit, Sector 40, formed a team to nab them, said the police.The suspects were arrested from Bareilly, where they had gone to meet their families.Preet Pal Sangwan, assistant commissioner of police (crime), said that the suspects and four other members of the gang robbed raw material and wires worth crores from the industrial area over the years. “They robbed two factories in March 2013 and left the city. Several raids were conducted, but we couldn’t find them. Four other members of the gang were arrested from different areas of Uttar Pradesh, but these two, who were arrested on Sunday, were on the run,” Sangwan said, adding that the suspects had been targeting industrial areas and took security guards hostage.“They used to target factories at isolated stretches and entered the area late in the night. They loaded the robbed raw material in a tempo, and later sold it to a Delhi resident who is yet to be identified,” he said.According to the police, the suspects have robbery and dacoity cases registered against them at several police stations. The suspects used to escape the city following each crime and used to return to their village after a few months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/2-notorious-robbers-arrested-in-bareilly-101618251040106.html
12-04-2021||Gurugram||Wrong-side driving, illegal parking lead to accidents, say police||Wrong-side driving and illegal parking, which account for almost 40% of the traffic offences in the city, led to accidents at black spots, the traffic police said on Monday.As per the police data, 12,508 people were penalised until March 31 for wrong-side driving, an increase from 10,834 reported in the same period last year, while 16,683 offences were recorded in 2019. With regard to unauthorised parking, 12,110 people were penalised this year till March 31, while 20,798 and 39,561 in 2020 and 2019, respectively.The police attributed the reduction in the number of offences over the last two years to the reduction in traffic due to the pandemic. However, the contribution of these two offences rose sharply from 2019. Sanjeev Balhara, the assistant commissioner of police (traffic), said, “Wrong-side driving and illegal parking are major causes of accidents. Of all the challans, 40% are for wrong-side driving and illegal parking over the last two years. The number of fines imposed for these two offences was 66,876 in 2019, of a total of 342,058. The total amount collected in penalties from commuters this year was around ₹2.73 crore, whereas it was ₹2.5 crore last year and ₹6.9 crore in 2019 (for the first three months).” Balhara said that the major problem along the expressway and across the city roads is that people do not believe in lane driving and parking. There is ample parking (space), but still, people prefer to park on roads and most of the times, in the unauthorised parking slots or on the main carriageway, resulting in vehicles being towed. “Traffic congestions have been reported from Galleria Market, South City 1 and 2, Sector 14, Palam Vihar and Sector 31 due to illegal parking. People try to avoid parking charges and end up paying large fines after their vehicles have been towed away,” he said. Although jumping red lights and use of mobile phone while driving could also lead to accidents, these are not major for the traffic police as the number of offences was low. As many as 83 people were penalised for using a mobile phone while driving and 252 for jumping red lights this year. According to the data, 230 motorists were penalised for speeding, of which 173 offences were recorded in March, with 4 and 16 in February and January, respectively. The traffic police, in collaboration with the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA), has been using cranes to tow away illegally parked vehicles since October 2019. They are also using a mobile application to keep the track of the towed vehicles, said police. Among other major traffic offences this year, according to the police data, 6,338 fines were issued to motorists riding two-wheelers without a helmet, while 5,707 were issued to pillion riders not wearing a helmet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/wrongside-driving-illegal-parking-lead-to-accidents-say-police-101618251038300.html
12-04-2021||Gurugram||19-year-old held for trying to extort money from shop owners||The police on Sunday arrested a 19-year-old man, identified as Sagar, the brother of convicted gangster Akku, from Sadhrana village near Sector 10 for allegedly trying to extort money from owners of sweet shops and firing at their establishments, the police said. The police said that Sagar planned to help his brother run the gang, as he was behind bars, and used to target shop owners after consulting his brother and his associates, who are at large but remain in touch with him.The police said they recovered from his possession the smartphone that was used to make extortion calls. He threatened owners of several sweets shops, with the latest incident on April 4, when he tried to extort the owner of a popular establishment in Chandu village.Preet Pal Sangwan, the assistant commissioner of police (crime), said that Sagar often visited the sweets shop to buy snacks, but the owner denied him discounts, following which he planned to extort money from him. “His brother Akku has been lodged in Bhondsi jail and is behind several murders, attempt to murder cases, robberies, abductions and extortions. Sagar lives in the village with his parents and helps his father in farming,” he said. The police said that Sagar, when questioned by the Sector 17 crime team, revealed the details of people he had targeted. “He identified his gang members, their role in murders, abductions and extortion cases registered in Haryana, as well as their hideouts. We are keeping a close watch on the gang members involved in extortion cases. We are tracking their mobile numbers and conducting raids at suspected locations to arrest them,” said Sangwan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/19yearold-held-for-trying-to-extort-money-from-shop-owners-101618251037686.html
12-04-2021||Gurugram||Night curfew starts at short notice, essential services allowed||The Haryana government on Monday evening imposed a night curfew from 9 pm to 5 am, prohibiting the movement of people not involved in essential services. The curfew was notified less than two hours before it came into effect, even as Gurugram recorded more than 1,000 new Covid-19 infections for a second consecutive day.An order released on Monday evening by the Haryana State Disaster Management Authority stated, “… there shall be prohibition on movement of individuals for all non-essential activities between 9 pm to 5 am in the state of Haryana. No person shall leave their homes or shall move on foot or by vehicle or travel or stand or roam around on any road or public places during the above said hours. The night curfew will remain in force till further orders.”Virendra Yadav, the chief medical officer of Gurugram, said, “This trend of increasing cases will continue in the coming days, but we cannot say for sure till when. We have increased testing at all possible fronts, at private and government facilities as well as cluster-based testing for surveillance. Further, night curfew has also been imposed by the state government to curb the spread of Covid-19.”During a spot check of the situation, the police were seen shutting bars and pubs in hubs such as MG Road, Sector 29 and also ensuring closure of liquor vends and tobacco stores across the city.However, exemptions have been given to those responsible for maintaining law and order, people in emergencies and those involved in municipal services and duties, including executive magistrates, police personnel, military and Central Armed Police Force (CAPF). Also, staff involved in essential services, such as health, electricity, fire department, and media persons will be exempt from the restrictions, on the production of an identity card. Those having night curfew pass will also be exempt, said officials.As per the order, hospitals, chemist shops and ATMs will be allowed to remain open through the night, while pregnant women and patients going for medical services have also been exempted. The order stated that there will no curbs on interstate and intrastate movements of essential and non-essential goods. Also, passengers going to or returning from the airport, railway stations or interstate bus terminals will be exempt from the night curfew. Those violating orders were warned of action under sections 51 to 60 of the Disaster Management Act, 2005, and Section 188 of the Indian Penal Code. Gurugram, which has the highest number of Covid-19 cases in the state, recorded as many as 1132 new cases on Monday, breaching the 1000-mark for the second consecutive day. Residents and traders were dismayed as the order came into effect on Monday, saying it affected their plans, even as the chief minister assured three days ago that such restrictions will not be enforced in the city.Last Friday, the CM said that district administrations across the state have been told to ensure safeguards, such as wearing masks, social distancing, check on public and social gatherings and sanitisation of public spaces is done on priority and continuously. “Vaccinations and testing are also going on smoothly and it will be further expanded,” he said on Friday.Ramesh Chand, a shopkeeper on Sohna Road, said that the night curfew will impact him adversely in financial terms. He said the order was too sudden and he had home deliveries lined up after 9 pm, as people return from their offices around that time. “We will again have to face a financial crunch as they have announced night curfew from 9 pm and this may be in advance of a complete lockdown. People will again start planning to return to their home towns and we have already stocked up groceries for the next few months and paid advances, which is a major concern,” he said. Lalit Ahlawat, director of Soi Hospitality in CyberHub, said that such as order was expected as Delhi and other states have already imposed the curfew. However, he said that less than two hours of notice was insufficient. “We will abide by the government orders, but we should have been given a day’s notice at least to plan our operations. The cases are rising and even we are concerned for the health of our staff,” he said. The order will also impact restaurant owners, who might have to apply for special passes for their staff. Raghav Baweja, owner of Big Wong at Cross Point Mall in DLF-4, said that they will close their operations for dine-in at 9 pm, but will continue food deliveries. “Now, we might have to take passes for our staff who will be returning home after 9 pm. Also, delivery persons would need passes, as allowed in Delhi and Noida,” he said. The police officials said that all possible measures will be taken to ensure enforcement of the night curfew. Karan Goel, the assistant commissioner of police (DLF), said, “Teams from all the police stations have been deployed and asked to keep a check in their areas. Travel of essential goods will not be affected but commercial establishments will not be allowed to run their operations. We are yet to take a call on passes and emergency movement will be allowed.” With increasing Covid-19 cases across the Delhi-NCR region, night curfew was imposed till April 30 in the national capital on April 7. Following Delhi, night curfew was also imposed a day later in Noida and Ghaziabad, till April 17.

Pune recorded a dip of 2756 cases after the district reported 12,377 cases on Sunday. The Covid-19 tally in the district reached 658,014 with the additional new cases on Monday. The district currently has 99,806 active cases of Covid-19.Pune is among the worst-affected by Covid-19 in the state and was accounting for 12% of the total cases reported nationwide towards the beginning of April. Pune is also one of the worst-affected urban areas in the world and has the highest number of active cases in the country.Pune, which is among the 10 districts contributing to India’s daily rise in Covid-19 cases, recorded 8151 recoveries taking the number of recovered to 547,851. The death toll in Pune reached 10,796 after 86 fresh fatalities were reported in the district. The positivity rate in Pune on Sunday was at 28.39% compared to 41% reported on April 4.The drop in the number of Covid-19 cases in Pune can be attributed to the imposition of strict curbs implemented on April 3.However, the medical infrastructure in the district is struggling to cope with the rising Covid-19 cases. The high-level public health team deployed by the Centre in Pune flagged the lack of ambulances as well as highlighted issues with medical oxygen supply. Pune currently has only 65 ambulances. The district is also reeling under a shortage of anti-viral drug Remdesivir. Though the city received over 6,000 doses of Remdesivir in the evening, several people protested outside medicine shops demanding the anti-viral drug for the relatives and friends who have contracted Covid-19.“We have distributed 6,000 doses of Remdesivir received on Monday. Each district in Maharashtra gets its share from the state according to hospitalised patients. Pune gets about 13-14% of the injections which the state gets,” Dinesh Khivasara, assistant commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) told HT.Despite this, several small hospitals did not receive Remdesivir stocks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/punes-covid-cases-fall-but-shortage-of-ambulances-remdesivir-worry-residents-101618249990021.html
12-04-2021||Other||Odisha seals inter-state borders amid Covid-19 surge; govt writes to centre for vaccine||Several Odisha districts bordering neighbouring states on Monday sealed the inter-state entry points to stop the possible entry of Covid-19 infected people. This comes as the state reported 1,741 new cases of Covid-19 in the last 24 hours, taking the total number of active cases in the state to close to 10,000.With the total positivity rate surging to 5.78 per cent from less than 1 per cent in a month, the state government said the government and private Covid facilities which were functional during the first phase of the Covid-19 pandemic would be activated in a phased manner with an increment of 50 beds at a time when needed.“The number of ICU beds would be 20 per cent of general beds and availability of ventilators at least 50 per cent of all lCUs. All private hospitals with 30 beds or more must have at least 10 per cent of available beds reserved for Covid-19 patients. They have to increase the facility up to 80 per cent of available general beds and ICUs in a phased manner as per the rise in the incidence of Covid-19 patients,” said Pradipta Mohapatra, additional chief secretary, health.The state government also imposed restrictions on patients and attendants in hospitals to decongest unnecessary crowd. As per the guidelines issued by the directorate of health services under the health and family welfare department, there will be no central registration and the non-essential admission of patients at hospitals will be avoided. All elective surgeries would be stopped and emergency surgeries need to be taken up with universal precautions. One attendant is to be allowed for every serious patient in indoor wards while in case of the OPD, the medical officer would avoid advising frequent re-visit of the patients. People are being encouraged to utilize existing telemedicine services for their ailments.Meanwhile, the district administrations of Sundargarh, Ganjam, Gajapati and Koraput sealed their borders with Jharkhand, Chhatisgarh and Andhra Pradesh. Sundargarh district has so far reported the highest number, 268, new cases. Sundargarh district collector Nikhil Pawan Kalyan said surveillance has been mounted at the border check posts on highways and railway stations. The RTO officials have been directed to allow entry to only those people with negative RT-PCR reports or final vaccination certificates.Both Ganjam and Sundargarh district administration have stopped the entry of outsiders to government offices from April 12.From Monday, the state government also made it mandatory for anyone arriving at its railway stations and airports to come with negative RT-PCR test reports or vaccination certificate. The negative test report must not be older than 72 hours.“Those travelling without RT-PCR negative report will now have to furnish their details and undergo seven-day mandatory quarantine,” said BMC commissioner Prem Chandra Chaudhary. On-the-spot testing will be conducted for people showing symptoms of the flu at the airport, he added.Workers in several industrial establishments in the state have also tested positive for Covid-19. The Balasore administration on Monday declared a colony of Emami Paper Mills Ltd in the district as a micro-containment zone after 103 employees tested positive for Covid-19. In the Rourkela Steel Plant, run by SAIL, as many as 28 employees tested positive for Covid-19.Amid the steep rise in Covid-19 infection in the state, as many as 700 centres were shut on Monday due to lack of vaccine even as 2.71 lakh doses of Covishield arrived in the state.State health minister Naba Das, in a letter to union health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan on Monday, said Odisha has so far has received 46.08 lakh doses of vaccines of which 42.71 lakh are of Covishield and the rest Covaxin.“Presently, there are 1.59 lakh doses of Covishield and 71,010 doses of Covaxin available in the state. The balance stock of Covishield will last for a day only. On April 3, Odisha held 1,476 vaccination sessions and vaccinated 2,71,480 beneficiaries in a single day. However, since then due to shortage and uncertain supply of vaccine we have been forced to close about half of our vaccination centres. With such low and uncertain supplies of vaccines, it is impossible for us to schedule sessions in advance or mobilize people with confidence. Hence, our daily utilisation has come down to 1 lakh though we have the capacity for 3 lakh vaccinations daily. In such a situation of short supply of Covishield vaccines, we are unable to observe the Tika Utsav properly,” wrote Das.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/odisha-seals-inter-state-borders-amid-covid-19-surge-govt-writes-to-centre-for-vaccine-101618249838178.html

12-04-2021||Noida||Delhi Meerut Expressway: Three unfinished underpasses leading to jaywalking at Vijay Nagar||Ghaziabad: Though the Vijay Nagar portion of the Delhi Meerut Expressway (DME) has provision of no less than three underpasses, jaywalking over the expressway to cross to the other side is a common feature, said residents.The three underpasses, constructed over a stretch of three-kilometre by the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), are meant for pedestrians and two-wheelers to cross from one side to the other. A number of densely-populated residential localities are situated on either side of the DME. Most of these colonies are in low lying areas, with the expressway built at an elevation.According to residents, infrastructure to connect the underpasses to localities is still not complete, even though the edifices of the underpasses are ready. “The authority has constructed drains before the entry/exit points of the underpasses, which are about four-five feet wide and not covered with slabs. So, residents cannot approach the underpasses. Further, the underpasses have no lights and garbage is strewn around. In some instances, residents have to climb several feet to reach the drains, and women and senior citizens find it difficult to do so,” said Lalit Kumar, councillor of ward number 27, Ghaziabad.The underpasses are located at Dundahera, Bhim Nagar and Sain Vihar. “The approach is so cluttered that people find it difficult to walk to the entry/exit points. So, they cross the DME afoot, risking their lives. This is a common occurrence here. People don’t do this willingly. They are forced to do so due to unfinished underpasses,” said Shiv Prakash, a local resident.HT visited the three underpasses and found that the approach to the one at Dundahera is unfinished and people have to walk on small slabs put over the drains. At Sain Vihar, the approach road remained stocked with loose soil and underpass cluttered with construction material. A similar situation was witnessed at the Bhim Nagar underpass.The speed limit at those portions of the DME which fall under the jurisdiction of Uttar Pradesh is 100km per hour (kmph), while for heavier vehicles it is 60kmph.HT had reported on this issue when the NHAI had officially opened the DME on April 1. Back then, officials said that they have a proposal to put up an additional fence, about five feet high, over a distance of one-and-a-half km on each side of the DME to discourage people from jaywalking.When approached about the issue, NHAI officials said work will be expedited.“We will level the uneven areas near the underpasses, and will also construct steps so that people don’t have any difficulty to approach the underpass’ entry/exit. Extra footpaths can also be given for a better approach to the expressway. We installed lights but some of these were taken away by thieves and others were damaged. We will expedite the work,” said Mudit Garg, project director from NHAI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/delhi-meerut-expressway-three-unfinished-underpasses-leading-to-jaywalking-at-vijay-nagar-101618249117598.html

12-04-2021||Ranchi||Ranchi suffers due to shortage of beds; samples pile up||Prashant Kumar, a 30-year-old veterinary student, ran from one hospital to another in Ranchi for more than five hours on Sunday night for a bed to admit his coronavirus infected sexagenarian uncle but all his efforts were in vein.Finally, Kumar took his uncle, a retired veterinary doctor, to Jamshedpur, around 125km from the capital city, where he was admitted to a private hospital. “My uncle is Covid-19 positive and his condition was serious. I booked an oxygen supported ambulance after facing lots of trouble and started searching for a bed from 8.30pm. I ran from one hospital to another till 1.30am. I visited at least 10 hospitals but nobody was ready to admit him.”He said, “The oxygen of the ambulance was getting dry. Then, we visited RIMS around 1am. The hospital authority said they can take admission but can’t provide oxygen support. Finally, I took my uncle to Jamshedpur.”The ambulance which they booked in Ranchi charged ₹17,000, Kumar said, adding that the ambulance to Jamshedpur charged ₹7,000 and ₹300 per hour for oxygen.”Like Kumar, hordes of people were forced to run from pillar to post to get beds in hospitals amid rising cases of Covid-19. Ranchi on Sunday recorded its highest 1,076 cases and 14 deaths. The city registered 6,917 cases between April 1 and 11, and 50 people died during the period.Even though the district administration claims to have arranged adequate beds, hospitals were facing acute shortage of oxygen supported and ICU (intensive care unit) beds.All ICU beds in government hospitals of Ranchi were fully occupied, while merely 24 ICU beds were available at 22 private hospitals, according to a report provided by Ranchi administration on Sunday evening.The district was also facing acute shortage of oxygen supported beds. Of total 784 such beds, 695 were occupied as on Sunday evening. As far as ventilators were concerned, 194 ventilators were available in the district, of which 121 were occupied.Jharkhand chapter president of Association of Healthcare Provider India (AHPI), Jogesh Gambhi admitted that the city was reeling under acute shortage of beds at private hospitals. “Covid-19 cases have risen suddenly in Ranchi. Besides, huge numbers of infected patients are also coming from outside Ranchi, thereby increasing load of private hospitals.”He said, “The private hospitals are increasing the beds as directed by the administration. But, it will take some time, as they have to handle non-Covid patients also.”Despite repeated efforts, Ranchi deputy commissioner (DC) Chhavi Ranjan could not be contacted.However, officials in the district administration claimed that they arranged a total of 2,383 beds for Covid-19 patients and 1,203 beds were occupied till Sunday evening. However, most of the vacant beds were normal beds without oxygen support.One Gokul Bhai lost his 54-year-old younger brother due to Covid-19. His brother died at Ranchi’s Seva Sadan around 6am on Monday. “Due to shortage of government ambulances, I booked a private ambulance to take the body to cremation ground at Ghagra. The ambulance charged me ₹6,000 for a five km,” he said.Atul Gera, a volunteer at NGO Life Savers, said, “The district administration has no control over private ambulances, who are charging arbitrarily during the pandemic. We have repeatedly been informing the administration in this regard but it has turned a blind eye.”Not only Ranchi but also the state was currently reeling under huge backlog of untested samples. Till April 11, as many as 21,411 samples were yet to be tested for Covid-19, according to the daily Covid-19 bulletin of state health department.Besides, private laboratories were also overburdened with a huge pendency of samples. It was also found that few test laboratories in Ranchi stopped sample collection in order to clear the backlog.Earlier on Sunday last, the state sent 5,901 untested samples, piled up in different laboratories, to Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), Bhubaneswar for RT-PCR test.Health minister Banna Gupta on Monday held a meeting with officials concerned, directing them to increase beds for Covid-19 patients. He directed all private hospitals to reserve 50% of the total beds for Covid-19 patients. The minister also ordered to convert residential centres of Skill India Mission into Covid Care Centres.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/ranchi-suffers-due-to-shortage-of-beds-samples-pile-up-101618246897543.html
12-04-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh administration says can't rule out lockdown if Covid-19 cases rise||Authorities in Chandigarh on Monday warned that if coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases continue to rise in the city then they will have to consider imposing a lockdown. Chandigarh adviser Manoj Parida said that sealing of borders is not an option as people from Delhi, Haryana and Himachal Pradesh enter the city daily. Parida said that lockdown impacts livelihoods and decisions on imposing lockdowns can only be taken after discussing with experts.“A lockdown cripples the economy as it impacts livelihoods of people. Decisions on lockdown are taken in war rooms only after conducting discussions with experts. We are keeping an eye on neighbouring states too. If cases continue to rise then the option of lockdown cannot be ruled out,” Parida was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.The administration in the Union Territory has already enforced a night curfew from 10pm to 5am from April 7 in a bid to curb the spread of Covid-19 in the city.Parida said that curbs can certainly be helpful coupled with people strictly adhering to Covid-19 preventive measures. “Night curfew along with restrictions on public functions and gatherings does help in some aspects. Borders cannot be sealed as people come to the city from Delhi, Haryana and Himachal Pradesh. People have to follow Covid-19 protocols and get vaccinated,” Parida further added.Despite the administration asking people to stay indoors and adhere to Covid-19 norms, residents were seen crowding at popular tourist site Sukhna Lake and flouting Covid-19 protocol.Chandigarh recorded 424 Covid-19 cases on Monday taking the tally to 31,167.

Nearly 3,500-4,000 Covid-19 cases are being reported everyday in Bihar after the resurgence of the disease in the past few days.Citing the recent study on factors for ambient air pollution, Ghosh said neighbourhood or outside boundary sources were the major contributors for deterioration in AQI in Patna. “Domestic pollution, which is mainly caused due to biomass burning, is another major issue that the government should step in to address the same,” the chairman said.He said department of transport and industries were no longer contributing to the worsening AQI. “The Board has embarked up on a major drive to install state of the art air quality monitoring stations across the state to know the source of pollutants and take corrective steps to check them at the source,” said Ghosh.Chief executive officer of the Centre for Environment and Energy Development (CEED) Ramapati Kumar said the prevailing scenario necessitated framing of city-based micro level planning to ensure smooth implementation of the clean air action plan. “The district level officers should be sensitised about strategy and implementation process of the plan. Apart from this, the government shall act on achieving low-hanging fruits such as replacing solid fuel with cleaner sources,” said Kumar.After strengthening the network to monitor AQI in Patna, the BSPCB has initiated steps to install air quality monitoring stations in 24 districts, besides Patna, Gaya, Muzaffarpur and Vaishali, this year. The board earlier proposed to set up air quality monitoring stations in all 38 districts, but availability of fund from both the Centre and the state government, restricted the plan to 24 districts of Valmikinagar, Siwan, Chapra, Buxar, Ara, Sasaram, Motihari, Bettiah, Muzaffapur, Aurangabad, Gaya, Rajgir, Begusarai, Bihar Sharif, Samastipur, Darbhanga, Muger, Saharsa, Bhagalpur, Katihar, Purnia, Araria and Kishanganj.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bihar-pollution-watchdog-seeks-check-on-air-pollution-amid-covid-19-surge-101618246778060.html

In a representation to the superintendent of the Patna Medical College Hospital (PMCH) on Monday, health manager Anjali Kumari claimed that establishing the identity of a deceased was not the mandate of a health manager, but that of nurses and duty doctors. Kumari, who joined the PMCH in 2014, requested that she be reinstated immediately. “Identifying the deceased is not the health manager’s responsibility, but that of nurses and doctors who are inside the Covid-19 ward and do the documentation before issuing the body carrying certificate,” said Kumari. “As health managers, we do not go inside Covid-19 wards. The health manager’s role is limited to communication and management. I am supposed to communicate with the relatives of the patient or the deceased and facilitate transportation of the body,” she said. “I have been made a scapegoat because of being on contractual service, I was the weakest link. The authorities have not taken any action against either doctors or nurses because they hold immense clout,” she said. PMCH superintendent Dr IS Thakur, however, said “The responsibility of establishing the identity of a deceased, infected with Covid-19, lies with the health manager, as per the hospital standard operating procedure (SOP) for Covid-19, drafted during the tenure of my predecessor Dr Bimal Karak. The health managers did not protest then.”“I will recommend action even against the doctors or healthcare worker, whosoever is found guilty,” added Dr Thakur. The PMCH, he said, had on Monday set up a three-member inquiry committee, comprising heads of the departments of paediatrics Dr AK Jaiswal, medicine Dr Kaushal Kishore and anaesthesiology Dr BK Kashyap to identify the guilty. The committee has been asked to submit its report within three days, said Dr Thakur. The PMCH also communicated to the Patna district magistrate (DM) Chandrashekhar Singh about the action taken against the health manager and constitution of a fact-finding committee. The DM had on Sunday sought a report within 24 hours from the principal of the medical college and hospital superintendent on the issue. The PMCH had on Sunday issued a death certificate of Chunnu Kumar, 40, a resident of Barh, who is recuperating from a fracture and has contracted coronavirus. Kumar, who was in the IJ ward, an ICU for Covid-19 patients, was shifted to the adjacent AB ward to make way for a critical Covid-19 patient, Raj Kumar Bhagat, 45, from Purnia, admitted to the hospital in the wee hours of Sunday. Though the patients were swapped in the midnight, the authorities, however, forgot to make the necessary changes in their medical records. So, when Bhagat died Sunday morning, the hospital authorities took him for Kumar and called the latter’s relatives and handed over Bhagat’s body to them. The trolley man, who handed over the body to Sadanand Sudhakar, Kumar’s cousin, claimed that the former had identified the body from a distance before it was taken to the crematorium where the relatives realised that it was a case of mistaken identity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/mistaken-identity-day-on-axed-pmch-health-manager-cries-foul-101618246717561.html

Sample these: Anju Verma, 51, a government schoolteacher in Buxar, gave her sample for RT-PCR test (registration No. 34017) at the Loknayak Jaya Prakash Narayan (LJPN) hospital in Patna on April 3, after she developed fever on March 31. Hospital authorities assured to give her the report in three days. Nine days on, she is yet to get her report. She has not received any intimation on her registered mobile number either. Piqued by the delay, she got herself tested on the rapid antigen kit at the same hospital and got a Covid-positive report on April 7. She is now under home isolation. Samridhi Shreya, 23, gave her sample for RT-PCR test (registration No. 34018) at the LJPN hospital, Patna, on April 3. Though she has still not got the report, Shreya got an automated call on her mobile number from the state health department’s Covid call centre , sharing information about quarantine protocol and seeking to know about her symptoms. Interestingly, this reporter had apprised about the two cases to a senior functionary in the health department on April 7, but to no avail. Unnat Shikhar, 31 and his cousin Sagar Sanjay, 21, gave their samples for RT-PCR test at the New Gardiner Road hospital on April 8. Four days on, they are yet to receive their reports. They continue to roam freely. As test reports get delayed, many carriers of the SARS-CoV-2 virus continue to roam freely and act as super spreaders. Of the total 80,018 tests done in the state on April 11, RT-PCR accounted for 38,601, TrueNat 2,492 and rapid antigen 38,925. Bihar had conducted 1,93,030 tests per million since the SARS-CoV-2 virus was first detected in the state on March 22, last year. Bihar reported 3,756 new infections on Sunday, taking the cumulative cases to 2,83,229. Of these Patna accounted for 1,382 new cases. The state’s total active cases had climbed from 350 last month to 14,695 on Sunday. Hospital beds were almost full at Patna’s three government medical colleges — the AIIMS at Phulwarisharif, the Nalanda Medical College Hospital, Patna City, and the Patna Medical College Hospital on Ashok Rajpath — reporting 90% occupancy. Bihar has a capacity of 21,203 at its dedicated Covid care centres. Of the available 15,883 beds, 14,974 were vacant and remaining 909 occupied as on Monday, as per health department data.On Monday, 2,999 positive cases were reported in Bihar taking the number of active cases to 17,052. Out of the 2999 positive cases, 1,197 cases were reported from Patna district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/it-is-a-never-ending-wait-for-rt-pcr-reports-in-bihar-101618246597519.html

Soon, villagers and labourers of the brick kiln caught hold of Yadav and beat him with sticks and bricks before setting him ablaze. Yadav was from neighbouring Yanchak village. Following the incident, tension gripped the two villages and a police contingent was deployed to keep the situation under control. Police said two separate cases had been registeredBhojpur’s superintendent of police (SP) Rakesh Dubey said Yadav had earlier killed his wife. “There was an old enmity between Choudhary and Yadav, which is said to be the reason behind the incident,” he said, adding that they were trying to identify the culprits.In a related video that has gone viral on social media, more than 50 people, including minors, are seen thrashing a man and putting dry leaves on his body before setting him on fire.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/two-set-ablaze-in-bhojpur-village-101618246417535.html

The patient suffered from severe symptoms for days and relatives continued to stay in his house for more than three days. The relatives took him to a nearby hospital which could not admit the patient because of lack of availability of beds. The patient breathed his last on Monday at 2 am in his house. The patient named Santosh Thosar with comorbidities had tested positive a few days ago and prior to that was suffering from flu-like symptoms. The patient was a resident of Ambedkar vasahat in Aundh. Ramesh Thosar, the neighbour and distant cousin of the patient said, “He did not get bed for the entire day on Sunday. I even contacted the local ward officer and he provided me with the PMC helpline number. We tried calling the number, but did not get any response. We took him to a nearby hospital, but they did not have any bed available and so we brought him back home. Early Monday morning he breathed his last. He was suffering from the symptoms since the past few days and had got him tested too. When the symptoms became severe, we took him to the hospital.” As the surge continues in the city, there is a growing demand for hospital beds.

Since non-essential businesses have been closed by the administration, dealers have been accepting online and phone bookings. Dealers of two-wheelers say that it won’t be possible for them to provide home delivery since the quantity is higher than cars. “Many want to bring home a new car on Gudhi Padwa. We will be delivering almost 50-60 cars at the doorstep on Gudhi Padwa. We had kept the phone booking option open and in the last week got the formalities from the Regional Transport Office (RTO) completed. Many four-wheeler dealers are going to do the same thing,” said Vinod Kale, vice-president (sales) Wonder Cars. Gudhi Padwa is considered an auspicious day to buy new things. So usually, the sale of automobiles goes up during this period. Dealers of two-wheelers say that though they have been accepting the bookings on phone, closed showrooms are still an issue. Akshay Shelar, a dealer of two-wheelers said, “Booking and payment can be done online but other formalities take time. We had accepted the bookings but passing of those vehicles from the RTO office could not be done. Also, if the showroom is going to be closed on Padwa, then how does the customer take it home?” “We can’t do home delivery of two-wheelers as it is not feasible for us. In comparison, four-wheelers have selective customers. So those dealers can do that but we don’t have any other option but to keep our showroom closed,” said an official from Pashankar auto. Last year on Gudhi Padwa, all the showrooms were closed due to the lockdown. “Overall purchase of vehicles has dropped last year. This year prior to Gudhi Padwa, there were only 50-60 percent bookings in comparison to the pre Covid years. Gudhi Padwa is the main day, now we are hoping that things will ease out by Akshay Tritiya,” said Shelar “The number of booking have reduced. We had still adopted the policy of facilitating the passing of those vehicles that were already purchased. RTO office has been currently functioning with 25 per cent capacity,” said Sanjeev Bhor, deputy regional transport officer, Pune RTO.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/automobile-showrooms-closed-on-gudi-padwa-cars-to-be-home-delivered-101618243597270.html
12-04-2021||Pune||Pune has only 65 dedicated ambulances for Covid treatment||Pune: The central team during its visit to the most affected districts in Maharashtra found that Pune has only 65 dedicated Covid-19 ambulances. Pune has over one lakh active cases as the progressive count continues to go beyond 6.51 lakh and 8,658 deaths due to the infection. The district is reporting about 12,000 cases and with only 65 dedicated ambulances in place the situation looks dire. The administration has acquired more private ambulances too, however, the demand remains higher than the supply. The central team in its report found that Pune has fewer ambulances than Nagpur with 137, Satara with over 100 ambulances, Latur with 117 ambulances, Buldhana with 70, Beed with 72 and Jalgaon with 161 ambulances. Pune has the highest number of active cases in the country and is possibly one of the worst affected urban areas in the world and so ambulances provide crucial services in the pandemic. Since Covid is primarily a respiratory infection, the ambulance has to be equipped with oxygen supply and qualified staff to provide valuable intervention during the “golden hour”. Dr Dnyaneshwar Shelke, chief operating officer of BVG group, 108 said, “Under 108, Pune district has 82 ambulances of which the city has 42 ambulances. Of the total 82, we have 39 for Covid management with necessary medical aid. However, the local administration has also acquired many ambulances under various programmes. After the first wave, the Pune zilla parishad acquired 52 ambulances which were integrated under 108. We have multiple ambulances which are also used to transfer Covid positives from home to Covid care centre or from Covid care centre to a higher medical facility. Also, these newly acquired ambulances are not counted under 108, but are used for control room mechanism and we provide coordination.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pune-has-only-65-dedicated-ambulances-for-covid-treatment-101618243057324.html

We are awaiting test reports for the past three days as there is a huge rush. Doctors said the treatment can begin only after seeing the test report. One of the doctors has given basic medicines.”Dr Rahul Joshi, rural health officer at Ghodegaon in Pune district, said, “The Covid situation is almost the same like Mumbai and Pune. In Ambegaon taluka, the situation is better as there is enough health facility and Covid centres, unlike neighbouring talukas.”One of the medical officers from Khed said on condition of anonymity, “The situation is getting bad in rural areas. The patients are coming forward for testing on doctors’ suggestion. When patients’ symptoms get worse, they are doing tests and it is taking too much time. Even beds are unavailable in government facilities and private hospitals are overcrowded.”A medical officer from Junnar said, “There is not enough testing facility. Patients are coming to doctors when their condition has become serious. They are running to neighbouring towns to get treatment.”Dr Sachin Pawar, who is practicing at Satana in Nashik district said, “The situation is bad. Earlier, people took the Covid threat lightly and now there are cases in every village. Medical facilities are not enough. Many hospitals are not getting adequate oxygen supply facility.”Dr Pawar said, “The population of Satana, Malegaon taluka is more than 7-8 lakh and it has only two CT scan machines. Patients are going 40-50 km to do high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) test. Positive patients are staying in line for more than 6-8 hours for the test.”Rupesh Sawant of Junnar said, “One of my relatives need Remdesivir injection. We are trying to get it from Nashik around 100 km far.

In February and April, residents along the Mula-Muth river side face the problem of hyacinth every year. The PMC makes a provision of ₹54 lakh to remove the hyacinth from water bodies across the city, by outsourcing the job; of this, ₹1.26 crore is for removal of hyacinth from the Mula-Muth river. Recently, Ajit Pawar, who is also guardian minister for Pune district, highlighted the problem at a canal committee meeting. Sandesh Patil, a resident of Bopodi, said, “In our area, we are suffering from mosquitoes and bad smell due to hyacinth. Every year, when we register complaints, PMC starts the work. It is a long-pending problem.” Rajesh Sawant, a resident of Aundh, said, “Our area is under smart city, but, we are facing a problem of mosquitoes and bad smell as PMC failed to remove hyacinth. Is this a smart city which cannot tackle a hyacinth problem?” Kunal Khemnar, additional municipal commissioner, said, “The corporation drainage department has started work to remove hyacinth with spiders and JCB machines. At least 40 people are removing hyacinth manually in various part of the city, like Aundh, Bopodi, Katraj lake, and Pashan lake.” “We have also instructed the drainage department to float a tender to remove hyacinth. We are monitoring the work on a daily basis,” he added. Jagdish Khanore, superintendent engineer of the drainage department said, “At the departmental level, we are taking the help of staff of the health department. At present, we cleared the hyacinth from the Mundhwa jackwell and in Aundh, with the help of spider machines. Based on the budgetary provision, we will float a tender if necessary.” Of 15 ward offices, the Mula-Mutha river passes through seven ward offices. Since 2013, the PMC has been using spider machines, mounted on a truck, that revolve 360 degrees. It picks up the hyacinth from the water surface and cleans the surface.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/pmc-to-float-tender-to-rid-mula-mutha-of-hyacinth-101618242577337.html

Experts believe students may suffer academically as the exams are delayed. The decision for Classes 1 to 9 and Class 11 was taken earlier this month. All students will be promoted without exams. However, students of Class 10 and Class 12 will be undergoing their final examinations offline, as per the education minister. The revised dates of the same will be declared soon, said Gaikwad. Speaking on the academic loss of students, Dinesh Gupta, a teacher, said the planning of many students have been disturbed now. “If the exams happened, the students could start focusing on competitive exams. Now they will be revising again the same syllabus. However, this is a good opportunity for students who could not clarify their doubts due to online teaching. Students will be under pressure. They will miss out their vacation time of May and June,” said Gupta. He added that due to the delay in exams, the next academic year will be shorter. “First year of graduation, or Class 11, for many will be short. There is a chance that students suffer through academic losses in this time,” said Gupta. Anubha Sahai, president of the India-wide Parents Association (IWPA), said that the government should go for an internal assessment, as the situation is unpredictable. “Postponement of the final board exams will not help students and parents, as they are under a lot of stress. Let there be internally assessed grades like other countries are doing. Central government should also intervene and come up with a uniform decision for all students,” said Sahai. Manoj Tangadpalliwar, a city-based parent, said that postponing the exam will affect morale. “My child has given two attempts at the JEE exams, but I will not risk the life of the kid by sending him for a JEE attempt again. The same is for Class 12 offline exams. With the increase in cases of Covid, we were discussing that my child should take a break this year and attempt the Class 12 exam next year. Offline exams this time are not feasible at all. The exams should be online exams or be cancelled entirely,” said Tangadpalliwar. Sampada Waghmare, a student of Class 12, said that it is a good decision to postpone the exams, but they may clash with other competitive examinations. “As the regular exams are now postponed, I can focus on competitive exams for a while. However, I hope the exams are conducted in May as per the schedule. Otherwise they may clash with other exams and cause more confusion,” said Waghmare.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/experts-believe-students-may-suffer-academically-with-ssc-hsc-exams-postponed-101618241977246.html

Pune which was once known for its dense green cover is losing it rapidly. In 2019 around Dussehra, a grand old peepal tree collapsed on Tilak road causing a roadblock for hours. According to Gurudas Nulkar, a member of the Pune ecological society the tree which had weathered many storms fell because of the sheer negligence of the authorities. “In their attempt to beautify, they had built a cement bridge around the tree’s roots. This tree fell because when the authorities built a cement bridge around this tree, the girth of the tree was less, over time it grew in circumference, the hole in the cement remained the same. The roots are spread as far apart as the branches of a tree. Even large trees can withstand storms if the roots are protected. But if this area becomes weak, the tree is in danger. Cement bridge did not allow the roots of the tree to grow causing it to fall,” Nulkar said. He also added that excessive pruning of a branch can cause the plant to lose its balance and increase the load on the roots. Tilak road is still asphalt, but cement roads do not leave room for roots to spread. Had it not been for the cement, the peepal would have survived. If bricks or mortar are used instead of cement, root growth is not stunted and their risk to the plant is reduced. Another advantage of Murbad surface is that rainwater can seep into the soil. Nulkar stressed upon the importance of large trees, for no matter how old a tree is, it has the ability to digest carbon which is very important today. Lokesh Bapat, another tree lover said, “The authorities are spending a lot of money on paver blocks, and cement footpaths, but they need to understand that the trees require at least one metre of open ground around its roots. If it is completely cemented how will it get oxygen and water? Instead of retaining the trees, they are weakening them and could be in danger for others.” Ashok Ghorpade, superintendent of gardens, PMC, “We have given in writing to the tree authorities that areas around the trees should be left alone and that paver blocks and concrete boundaries limit the oxygen supply to the roots of the trees thus making them weak. We have been writing and making this point time and again to all the assistant commissioners who are also the tree authority officers for each ward.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/concrete-boundaries-around-trees-uprooting-city-s-green-cover-experts-101618241797357.html

It was just a spider||An unwanted movement inside the strong room in Cachar district of Assam, where the polled EVMs were being kept under CCTV surveillance, led to chaos on Monday morning. The monitoring camera’s sensor suddenly showed a human-like figure and issued an alert suggesting a movement inside the strong room of Sonai constituency. “In the footage, a cobweb strand is visible moving from one side of the frame to the other. It is possible that the sensors sensed that movement and flashed an alert on the monitor,” said Additional Deputy Commissioner, Cachar, Sumit Sattavan, after inspection. He confirmed that it was a spider. The incident took place at around 10.25 am but led to day-long chaos.The alert caused tension among the contesting candidates. Some of them, along with their agents, rushed to the spot and started protesting outside the NETRiP centre where the EVMs of 7 constituencies of Cachar district were kept. Except for the BJP, almost all the political parties have appointed their members in front of the strong rooms where monitors show 24-hour recordings of the rooms. A Congress agent suddenly noticed a human-like symbol popping up in one of the recordings and immediately informed his party leaders. Finally, a group of officials from the district administration visited the place and they showed the recordings to all the candidates and agents present. It was found that a spider was moving near the sensor of the camera which caused the alert.Congress candidates Mukesh Pandey and Kamakhya Prasad Mala, along with AK Azad Laskar - election agent of AIUDF candidate Karim Uddin Barbhuiya - and some members of the Congress were present when the footage was shown. As per the request, the footage was extracted and played on large screens at the centre. “We are concerned about the safety of the EVMs after few incidents took place post-election in Barak Valley. But the administration cooperated with our request and gave us a chance to review the footage. We saw the footage and whatever we could gather, it did not look like a human movement. However, we are yet to get the full footage and will be assured only after a thorough inspection,” Laskar said.Congress and AIUDF members gathered in front of the election monitoring centre after the incident took place while some of them started protesting. Though the NATRiP and nearby area is heavily guarded by central paramilitary forces and have a strong presence of Assam Police, a team of Cachar police led by Additional Superintendent of Police, Jagadish Das, rushed to the spot. They managed to convince the people and requested them to go back.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/alarm-after-cctv-camera-spots-movement-in-assam-s-evm-strong-room-it-was-just-a-spider-101618241677949.html

The PMC has declared our society as a micro-containment zone. We are not allowing anyone from outside to enter the premises until they have done the test, though there is a lot of confusion about the rules, we have made it mandatory,” said Manish Mishra, Felicita society on Baner-Pashan Link road. In Paritosh society, residents have been doing the sanitization process on their own following the standard Covid protocol. “We decided to sanitize on our own instead of waiting for someone from PMC to come. When a Covid positive patient is detected, the affected floors are fully sanitized - including the doors, door handles, bell switches of all flats on that floor, railings, lift buttons, dust bins, passages. The insides of all lifts are sanitized every hour, as well as the staircases. Every visitor to the society is screened at the security gate. From April 11, we are not allowing any outside visitor unless it is an emergency,” said Ashish Kotamkar, chairman, Paritosh society. While townships like Megapolis in Maan, Hinjewadi have gone hi-tech whereupon instead of pasting yellow slip of paper they maintain a tracker in the maintenance office. “Additionally, we provide a separate WhatsApp group for such flats, where society manager, security supervisor, the secretary is added with a member of the flat; so that we can provide them any assistance that is needed. Each flat has an individual WhatsApp group so that we don’t reveal any identity,” said Anshul Gupta, resident of Megapolis. Sopanbaug societies have sprung into action by sealing off their premises for everyone, including caretakers and domestic workers. “In certain societies, only particular buildings are made as containment zones and in those buildings, movement is totally restricted. No flat owner can go out and no maids or servants are allowed in that building, until notified by the PMC,” said Sachin Khandelwal, Sopanbaug residents’ association.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/societies-take-the-lead-with-strict-covid-protocol-and-restricted-movement-101618241617272.html

The government, according to Credai, has collected ₹10,225 crore in the fund in the last six years, 8% of which has been used for the welfare of workers.“We request the chief minister to look into these cases and provide at least Rs5,000 from the Building and Construction Workers Welfare account to the construction workers,” said Sunil Furde, president, Credai, Maharashtra.According to Furde, a second wave of Covid has once again prompted the reverse migration of workers in large numbers. It will have a negative impact on the construction industry that is totally dependent on them for meeting deadlines, be it Rera, banks or customers.“Without a proper labour force, developers will have to stop construction activities, resulting in accumulated losses and interests. Also, multiple legal cases in Rera cannot be ruled out,” said Furde.“Last year, during the pandemic, construction was halted for about 2.5 months and after restarting, it took us more than six months to get a proper labour force in place. Rera extended the deadline by only six months, whereas developers lost more than eight months. This year again if there is attrition and reverse migration of labour, the construction industry will see its worst times. We developers from Credai Maharashtra are already doing our best by providing free vaccinations, proper sanitising of labour camps, toilets, and taking care of their health and hygiene requirements. We urge the government to extend its full support to the workers,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/give-rs5k-to-each-construction-worker-from-state-fund-credai-tells-cm-101618240657140.html

The state recorded 5,105 positive cases on Sunday of which the maximum number of cases (864) was reported from Udaipur district, according to the state health department data. Additional district magistrate, Udaipur City, Ashok Kumar said, “106 containment zones have been formed since April 2 in the district, which has the maximum positive cases.” According to the health department data, Udaipur witnessed over 1700% increase in cases in the last 20 days. On March 22, the district reported 47 cases, which increased to 864 on April 11, the highest in the state. In the same period, Jaipur witnessed an increase in cases by 338%, Kota by 700% and Jodhpur by 1157%. Officials said the highest number of Covid-19 tests are being done in Udaipur. With every third person found infected, the positivity rate in the district has reached 30%, and patients have occupied 66% ICU and oxygen beds in hospitals. Following the spike in cases, the state government imposed a 12-hour night curfew from 6 pm to 6 am from Saturday.On Monday morning, the state crossed 10 million vaccination figure and became the second state after Maharashtra in inoculations, the officials said. State health minister Raghu Sharma said the vaccination drive started in the state for all people above 45 years from April 1 across 3,380 government and 188 private health centres.“An average of 470,000 people have been vaccinated daily in the last four days. 544,000 people were vaccinated on April 5; 484,000 on April 6; 581,000 on April 7; 465,000 on April 8; 421000 on April 9; 296,000 on April 10; and 111,000 on April 11.On the morning of April 12, the figure crossed 10 million. A total of 1,11,40,860 Covid-19 vaccine doses have been received from the Centre till April 11,” Sharma said.Facing vaccine crunch, the state health department has asked the Union health ministry to provide doses in inadequate number else the momentum of the inoculation drive will be affected.“The Centre sent 400,000 doses on Sunday, but this doesn’t serve the purpose as our daily requirement is over 500,000 doses,” a senior official said on condition anonymity.“Rajasthan is a geographically big state; supply of vaccines to health centres in rural areas takes time. We have apprised the issues to the Union health ministry and are now hoping to get a positive reply,” he said. Meanwhile, on directions of the state government, district collectors are holding meetings with religious leaders to convince them to shut religious places to curb the spread of the virus. In Bikaner, Karni Mata temple will be closed till April 21. Devotees can visit the temple online and LED screens will be put up outside the temple.

The bypolls scheduled on April 17 were necessitated for the Pandharpur-Mangalvedha seat after the demise of three-term NCP legislator Bharat Bhelke, in the last week of November.“When this government came into power, it was called Maha Vikas Aghadi, but now it has become a “Maha Vasooli (extortion) Aghadi”. The way they have started the vasooli from police, farmers and the common man, it shows that all thethree ruling parties (Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress), have only one agenda and that is to collect money from wherever it is possible,” Fadnavis alleged.Fadnavis was referring to allegations ofcorruption raised by former Mumbai police chief Param Bir Singh, against then home minister Anil Deshmukh, an NCP stalwart.The former chief minister also said the highest number of Covid-19 cases and fatalities are being reported from Maharashtra.“In the last 10 days, 50 to 55 per cent of the total deaths in the country were reported from Maharashtra. Similarly, 60 per cent of the total cases in the country were also reported from Maharashtra,” he said, adding, “I can understand locking and unlocking (to contain the spread of coronavirus) is important, but when a lockdown is imposed, people lose their jobs. Unfortunately,the state government is not at all conscious about providing financial help to the (vulnerable) people”.He said governments in Chattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka have helped the common man and farmers.“It is the responsibility of the state government to help people in distress, but this (MVA) government, instead of helping people, is recovering power bills from them like the “jizya” tax that used to be imposed during the Mughal era,” Fadnavis said. He said the state government has stopped disconnecting power connections of people (who have failed to clear their dues) due to this by-election.“But you will see that the government will resume snapping power connections after the bypoll is conducted on April 17,” he claimed.Fadnavis said West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee, the communists and the Congress will receive a big jolt on May 2 when results of the assembly polls held in five states are out.Speaking at another campaign rally, Fadanvis said, “People may think what difference a bypoll will make to change the state government. Leave it to me when to change this government. We will change that, but for now, this bypoll is important as the people of this constituency have got the opportunity to show the government its place”.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/lockshahi-in-state-instead-of-lokshahi-says-fadnavis-in-critique-of-mva-govt-101618237357068.html

The political leaders staged an agitation before the civic chief present at the standing committee meeting. Congress city unit president Ramesh Bagwe, Aba Bagul, Arvind Shinde, Sanjay Balgude and Datta Bahirat led the protest. Bagwe said, “The Congress had alerted the municipal commissioner about the Covid second surge and even held a meeting with him on March 30 seeking various steps to check the virus spread. Now, there is acute shortage of beds and Remdesivir injections.” Bagul said that due to shortage of staff at the Naidu hospital, the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) is allowing relatives inside the ward to take care of patients. Shinde alleged that Covid helplines are not working. He said that it’s PMC’s responsibility to provide injections and medicines at civic-body run shops. The municipal commissioner assured that the administration would take adequate steps to address the crisis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/cong-stage-protest-in-front-of-pune-civic-chief-over-mishandling-of-covid-situation-101618235616952.html

Deshmukh resigned from his position on April 5 just hours after the high court order, in which the bench observed that an independent probe against him was not possible as the state police reported to him.Also Read | Bombay HC directs CBI to conduct preliminary probe against Anil DeshmukhOn April 8, terming the allegations against the NCP leader as “serious,” the Supreme Court dismissed Deshmukh and the Maharashtra government’s plea challenging the high court order.Also Read | 'Serious' allegations against Anil Deshmukh require CBI probe, rules Supreme CourtIn a letter to Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on March 20, Singh accused Deshmukh of tasking officials of the Mumbai Police to collect ₹100 crore per month from bars, restaurants, hotels in the city. The development took place three days after the senior officer was shunted by the Deshmukh-led home ministry from his position as the police chief of Mumbai to a “low-key” post of commandant general of the Home Guards, for “mishandling” the probe into the explosive-laden vehicle found outside the residence of billionaire Mukesh Ambani on February 25.Singh then moved the Supreme Court seeking a CBI probe against the NCP leader but was asked to approach the high court first, which passed its orders on a separate plea filed by Dr Jaishri Patil.Dilip Walse Patil, also from the NCP, has since assumed charge as the home minister of Maharashtra. The state government has also set up a one-member panel, comprising former Bombay HC judge Kailash Chandiwal, to probe the allegations against Anil Deshmukh, and submit a report in six months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/anil-deshmukh-summoned-by-cbi-for-questioning-on-april-14-officials-101618233411168.html

12-04-2021||Bangalore||Tushar Vashisht: I feel happier when I am singing or playing music as it is my release||Tushar Vashisht has been learning and singing music since he was six and has trained in Hindustani Classical for years. Later, when he went abroad for further studies, he was part of a band and created original songs. Vashisht says, “One of my first originals was called Pehchaan, which made it to America’s Best of College A Capella in 2008. It’s the only Hindi song to ever make it to the list. Since then, I have been busy with work and business.” He started his career as an investment banker, later joined Aadhar and finally, went on to create the app, HealthifyMe. In the last 10 years, the singer didn’t have time to focus on music yet managed to create a few songs. It was a-year-and-half ago, that he “fortunately” met Raghu Ramasubramanian at a concert and later jammed with him on a few songs. One of the songs is his latest release, Kahaani. Talking about the new song, Vashisht says, “It is about losing and finding someone, about love and how feeble it is. I am sure all of us can relate to the songs as everyone has loved and lost at some point. I was in a particularly down mood one day and had called Raghu, who told me to write the feelings into a song. An artist needs a muse and sometimes, heartache and in my life I have had both (laughs).”Now, he plans to keep the momentum going and has worked on an EP, with three songs. Last year, during the pandemic, the duo found time to work on music and created a social bubble. “We hung out and we were all bit free on nights and weekends. In fact, the four songs took 18 months to make. I never feel happier when I am singing or playing music. And music is my release. I remember, when I opened for Lucky Ali’s concert in Bangalore and sang Kahaani, people responded well. In fact, they were singing along which usually doesn’t happen for independent songs,” says the singer, who created Pop, Rock and Sufi songs and is now experimenting with Jazz and Blues too. Recalling the Ali concert, which was in an open air venue, Vashist admits that with the pandemic, concerts have taken a beating. “Things are bad and tough for music and musicians. But things will change and it has to. Once things settle down and we move on, it will all come back. While concerts and public gatherings have been curbed, on the other hand, people like me have time now to create more. Simultaneously, some really great music has been coming out, which wasn’t the case earlier. Yes, there have been some bad parts but there have also been some silver lining as non mainstream musicians have got the chance to put things out there,” he concludes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/tushar-vashisht-i-feel-happier-when-i-am-singing-or-playing-music-as-it-is-my-release-101618234177781.html
12-04-2021||Mumbai||Covid-19 lockdown leads to loss of jobs, says BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis||Stating that people lose their jobs when a lockdown is imposed, senior BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis on Monday alleged the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government is not serious about providing any financial aid to the vulnerable sections.Taking a dig at the state government amid talks that an extended lockdown is imminent in Maharashtra in view of a steep rise in Covid-19 cases, Fadnavis said there is a "lockshahi" in the state now instead of 'lokshahi' (democracy).The Leader of Opposition in the Legislative Assembly was addressing a rally for the upcoming bypoll to Pandharpur-Mangalvedha Assembly constituency in Solapur district.The BJP has fielded Samadhan Autade against Bhagirath Bhalke, son of late MLA Bharat Bhalke, of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) for the April 17 contest."When this government came into power, it was called as Maha Vikas Aghadi but now it has become a 'Maha Vasooli (extortion) Aghadi'. The way they have started the vasooli from police, farmers and the common man, it shows that all the three ruling parties (Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress) have only one agenda and that is to collect money from wherever itis possible," he alleged.Fadnavis was referring to the allegations of corruption raised by former Mumbai police chief Param Bir Singh against then home minister Anil Deshmukh, an NCP stalwart.The former chief minister also said the highest number of Covid-19 cases and fatalities are being reported from Maharashtra."In the last ten days, 50 to 55 per cent of the total deaths in the country were reported from Maharashtra. Similarly, 60 per cent of the total cases in the country were also reported from Maharashtra," he said.Fadnavis said, "I can understand locking and unlocking (to contain the spread of coronavirus) is important but when a lockdown is imposed, people lose their jobs. Unfortunately, the state government is not at all conscious about providing financial help to the (vulnerable) people".He said governments in Chattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka have helped the common man and farmers."It is the responsibility of the state government to help the people in distress but this (MVA) government, instead of helping people, is recovering power bills from them like the 'Jizya' tax that used to be imposed in the Mughals era," Fadnavis said.He said the state government has stopped disconnecting power connections of people (who have failed to clear their dues) due to this byelection."But you will see that the government will resume snapping power connections after the bypoll is conducted on April 17," he claimed.Fadnavis said West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee, the communists and the Congress will receive a big jolt on May 2 when results of the assembly polls held in five states will be out.Speaking at another campaign rally, Fadanvis said, "People may think what difference a bypoll will make to change the state government. Leave it to me when to change this government. We will change that, but for now, this bypoll is important as the people of this constituency have got the opportunity to show the government its place".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/covid19-lockdown-leads-to-loss-of-jobs-says-bjp-leader-devendra-fadnavis-101618231603871.html
12-04-2021||Patna||Patna municipality uses two-pronged strategy to contain Covid-19||Patna Municipal Corporation (PMC) has stepped up its sanitisation drive and awareness campaign on the importance of Covid-19 vaccination amid a rise in infections in the state, said municipality officials.“The vaccination centres are getting high footfalls as PMC staff members are creating awareness in different parts of the city,” said municipality commissioner Himanshu Sharma. He added that the door-to-door garbage pick-up vans will play catchy jingles prepared by the health department to motivate those above 45 years of age to get the vaccine shot. The initiative comes during the four-day long Tika Utsav- a special Covid-19 vaccination drive launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday.PMC is running vaccination centres in all the six circle offices in the state capital, covering the entire city population including the slums and has laid out a plan to intensify the campaign to mobilise people for vaccination in the coming week. For the last one week, 700 to 800 vaccine doses have been administered on an average at the six centres at Azimabad, New Capital, Patliputra, Kankarbagh, Nutan and Bankipore circle. Bihar reported 2697 fresh infections on Sunday to take the number of active cases in the state to 14,696. Patna is the worst-affected city in the state with 1,382 cases detected on Sunday, taking the capital’s Covid tally to 60,875, as per the government data.On the front of implementation of Covid-19 norms, the district administration has sealed 17 shops and seized 92 vehicles, collecting a sum of ₹3.21 lakh in penalty for flouting Covid-19 guidelines between March 16 and April 10, said a district official.The PMC says it is using all 20 jetting machines and 300 small, hand-held spraying machines for sanitisation of public places, restaurants, containment zones, slums and residential areas.In Patliputra circle, the sanitisation drive was carried out at Bans Ghat, Kotwali police station, Rajbanshi Nagar and government residences. In Nutan circle, Patna Junction, Dak Bungalow, Bailey Road and Boring Road localities were sanitised.“Our prime focus is to sanitise the crowded places. We are also spraying disinfecting solutions on those establishments and houses which have been marked as Covid-19 infected zones by the district administration to protect the locals from getting infected,” said Harshita, PMC public relation officer.Another senior PMC official said that the intensified disinfection drive had increased workload on sanitisation staff.“We can’t halt the routine work. We have divided the cleaning team in groups for sanitisation, door-to-door garbage collection. Another team has been dedicated to unclogging sewage and manholes before April 30 as a part of pre-monsoon preparations,” said the official on condition of anonymity.Pankaj Singh, a resident near SK Puri colony, however, rued, “Despite regular public use, ATMs are not being sanitised. Garbage collection has become infrequent and untimely.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/patna-municipality-uses-two-pronged-strategy-to-contain-covid19-101618228117301.html

12-04-2021||Pune||Monday Musings: When the state-controlled sale of a drug is a good thing||PUNE On Sunday afternoon, when the entire city was locked-in and roads were deserted as part of the weekend shut down, a video went viral. The video was of a woman crying inconsolably when she failed to get Remdesivir for her family member, despite standing in a long queue for hours, from 5 am, at the medical association’s office in Shukrawar peth, the heart of Pune. The woman was not the only one to have made desperate attempts to procure the antiviral drug for their near and dear ones in the last few days. For the past one week, Pune has witnessed a terrible shortage of this expensive, and much- hyped drug, which is being prescribed on a large scale by doctors, leading to its scarcity. This in effect has led to black marketing and overcharging. Those with money and connections could easily procure it, while others, sans both, are left to scramble. In the absence of any other specific medicine that can cure Covid-19, Remdesivir was first touted as an efficient antiviral against the Coronavirus in the United States. In India, it was made part of the treatment protocol for Covid–19 under emergency use authorisation since July 2020. In November 2020, interim results from trials conducted by the World Health Organisation revealed four of the commonly used drugs - Remdesivir, malaria drug hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), an anti-HIV combination of lopinavir and ritonavir, and the immunomodulatory, Interferon - provide little or no benefit in reducing fatalities in hospitalised patients. The interim results showed “there is currently no evidence that Remdesivir improves survival and other outcomes in these patients”. Yet doctors in Pune and the rest of the state have been prescribing it, while the Maharashtra government too has sought an additional supply of antiviral drug from six companies that produce it. On April 8, Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope chaired a meeting with manufacturers of Remdesivir. During the meeting Tope asked manufacturers to double the production for the state, which is getting around 50,000 doses each day. According to Tope, the state will start getting around 75,000 doses from April 15. At the same time Indian government has banned export of Remdesivir and Remdesivir active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) till the Covid-19 situation in the country improves, as per an order issued on Sunday. In fact, the March 23, 2021, guidelines issued by the Maharashtra government retained Remdesivir for severe cases battling Covid-19. The protocol prescribes Remdesivir 200 mg on day 1 followed by four doses of 100 mg for the next four days. While the medical world may have been divided on the use of Remdesivir, it’s the patients who are now seeking the drug, which they consider life-saving, even when their kin are not in critical situations. Many believe the drug can save patients from the killer Coronavirus and go in for panic buying. Even as study published in The Lancet journal in November 2020, said, “For patients with mild or moderately severe Covid-19 and no need for respiratory support, Remdesivir does not offer significant benefit at day 28 and its use is not recommended. For individuals at high risk of hyperinflammation, who are diagnosed early during illness (≤10 days) and require supplemental oxygen, Remdesivir shortens the time to recovery and reduces the risk of progression. This clinically important endpoint is cost-effective in some health-care settings. Under these circumstances, Pune district administration has taken the commendable decision that will counter the black-marketing of drug and prevent its sale above the MRP. On Saturday, Pune district collector Rajesh Deshmukh issued an order preventing over-the-counter sale of Remdesivir. The order allows hospitals to provide the injection to patients and not ask family or relatives to buy the drug. The hospitals, according to the order, can place an order of Remdesivir with a supplier keeping in mind the requirement for patients undergoing treatment. Suppliers will have to provide a daily sale report of the drug, including hospital name, associated chemist’s name, bills, and total sale to the Pune Food and Drug Administration (FDA). For a change, the controlled sale of the drug can stop people standing in long queues and yet returning empty handed without the drugs. It can also prevent the indiscriminate use of drug, currently being prescribed to anyone and everyone.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/monday-musings-when-the-state-controlled-sale-of-a-drug-is-a-good-thing-101618227397971.html

12-04-2021||Pune||Impact of curbs? Pune district’s positivity rate drops||From 41% on April 4 the Pune district’s positivity rate dropped to 23% as on April 10, a week after stricter curbs were imposed in Pune to contain the spread of virus. On Sunday, the positivity rate stood at 28.39%, with the district reporting 12,377 cases and the total samples tested were at 43,593.Since mid-February, Covid cases have been on the rise with the positivity rate also going up. However, since the past few days the positivity rate has seen coming down in the district. This could also be a result of the mini-lockdown announced in Pune on April 3, forcing people to stay indoors after 6 pm, while shutting down most shops expect those engaged in essential services. The state government has now almost made up its mind to impose a complete lockdown to break the chain of the virus across Maharashtra, including Pune, which has been the worst affected. Experts, however, believe that to find any glimmer of hope the positivity rate has to go further below and maintain a plateau. Dr Subhash Salunkhe, Covid-19 advisor to the Maharashtra government said, “It is difficult to conclude based on this. These are just numbers as of now as we have had the positivity rate fall down to below 10%. Right now the priority is to manage beds, drugs and oxygen for Covid-19 patients. The curve needs to become a plateau. Whether or not the curfew has been effective is too premature to say now.” Nationally, Pune’s share of daily caseload has also dropped with the district reporting less than 10,000 positive cases for the past two days. India on Saturday reported 1,52,879 cases. Earlier this month, Pune district was accounting around 12 per cent of the cases registered nationally. Ajit Pawar, deputy chief minister said, “This wave is stronger than the first wave. Pune’s positivity rate is also going down which is now about 25-30%. Earlier while Akola and Amravati also reported the highest positivity rate which was about 50% during the peak, it has now gone down to 7%. We hope to see the decline in Pune too.”As cases continued to rise the number of tests to detect Covid also went up from within a week’s time from 28,000 on April 5 to 41,000 as of April 10. As the number of tests increased the positivity rate also dipped this week. In the week between March 25 and 31, the positivity rate for the district was 26.7% and for the week between April 1-7, it went further up to 31.4%. Positivity rate is the total number of cases tested positive for Covid-19 against the total tests done. However the following week, between April 5 and April 10, the positivity rate saw a fall to 23.79%. The highest positivity rate was 41.2% which was on April 4. Positivity rate reflects the spread of the infection and the number of positives reported for every 100 tests.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/impact-of-curbs-pune-district-s-positivity-rate-drops-101618224937074.html
12-04-2021||Pune||Pune traders demand complete lockdown for all in city||Several trader associations were locked in heated discussions with deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar late on Sunday night. At the time of going to press, no decision was reached in terms of what the associations had been demanding – to allow all non-essential stores and shops to remain open in Pune. However, the traders did request a uniform lockdown for everyone in the city, citing that a partial lockdown was of no use. The traders, prior to the start of the meeting, had remained firm on the opening of non-essential shops in Pune on Monday on April 12.Earlier on April 8, 50 trader associations across Pune protested against the state government’s strict restrictions on closing of non-essential shops. “We decided to wait till Monday to open up the shops. All non-essential shops in Pune will be opened from 10.30 am across Pune,” Fatechand Ranka, president of Federation of Trade Association of Pune (FTAP), said before the meeting on Sunday. Pune police lodged a FIR against 35 traders, including Ranka, for violating Covid norms during the protest. Talking about the issue state deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar had said, “It is true that there is anger among traders and many other elements in the society but the Covid situation in the state is in bad shape. Usually, it is my experience that if the facts get put they agree to the decision.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pune-traders-demand-complete-lockdown-for-all-in-city-101618224457190.html

The Undergraduate Medical Education Board of the NMC took the decision following several representations by the students citing the Covid-19 pandemic crisisThe decision brings relief to many students, who have been studying virtually from their home towns due to the Covid-19 situation, making it difficult for a large number to return to their institutes to complete the mandatory internship.“Considering the representations and the existing regulatory provisions, (while) it is mandatory that internship should be completed in the teaching hospital affiliated to the medical institute the student is enrolled in. However, in the event of any difficulty due to the current pandemic situation, this internship can be completed at another NMC approved medical college hospital,” said a statement by the education board.There are approximately 35,000 students across four years enrolled in 56 undergraduate medical colleges in Maharashtra and the decision will impact roughly 6,000 students eligible for internship in the state. Medical colleges in the state have been conducting offline classes for undergraduate students since March 2020 after the outbreak of the disease. Maharashtra is the worst-hit state with 5,67,097 active coronavirus cases, the highest in the country by far. It also reported 63,294 cases - the highest daily cases on Sunday, taking the state’s tally to 3,407,245 cases and 57,987 fatalities.The NMC board statement also highlights that this relaxation is subject to the approval of the college authorities and the university concerned, where the student is enrolled for MBBS training. The board also clarified that this provision, referred to as externship, usually chargeable by the institute, will be without any charges this time round.The medical colleges have not reacted to the decision so far, however, parents are supporting the move.“Every year, hundreds of students wish to come back to their hometowns to complete their internship but are instead burdened with overhead fees in order to be accepted by a hospital of their choice. This year, due to the pandemic, several students are already far from their teaching hospital so it’s only fair to allow them to continue internships without levying fees,” said Brijesh Sutaria, parent of a medical student.Over the last year, several MBBS students, including from the final year batch, have been working as part of the Covid-19 task force in several government hospitals across the state. Some of them are also demanding that it be considered a part of the internship. “The government as well as NMC should also consider the time students spent working as frontline Covid warriors as part of their internship and allow concession to the actual internship period,” said Anubhav Jain, a third year MBBS student from a Solapur-based medical institute.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-mbbs-students-allowed-internship-in-non-parent-medical-colleges-101618222837799.html

12-04-2021||Delhi||Mixed land use rules changed Delhi; now, residents want them reviewed||For residents of New Rajinder Nagar in central Delhi, walking on the stretch between H-block and the blind school for girls in the residential colony is a nightmare. With the opening of new commercial establishments in the past few years, the colony road has become one of the most congested stretches in the area.“With vehicles parked haphazardly on both sides on the roads, there is no space for pedestrians to walk. It wasn’t always like this. Since 2006, when commercial activity was allowed on the road under mixed land use, the situation has worsened,” said Neeraj Gupta, president of H-Block RWA.While commercial establishments have mushroomed on residential plots on the road, Gupta said, the shopping complex developed by the Delhi Development Authority (DDA), located just a few metres away from the road, is lying unused for years. “There are over 100 shops in the complex of which a majority are lying closed for years. What’s the point of allowing commercial activity in a residential colony when there is a planned commercial space available nearby?” said Gupta.This is the situation in a large number of residential neighbourhoods in the national Capital. Resident welfare associations (RWAs) in the city say that the Mixed land use (MLU) provisions—MLU in residential areas was one of the crucial developments in the Master Plan of Delhi-2021—have “ruined the residential character” of the neighbourhoods.With the DDA working on the new master plan (MPD-2041), RWAs want the land-owning agency to review and rework the MLU provisions.Rajiv Kakria, convener, Save Our City campaign and a resident of Greater Kailash-I, said, “It (MLU) has destroyed the residential character of neighbourhoods. Today, safety and security has become our utmost concern due to rampant commercialisation of residential areas. We don’t know who is entering our areas. It has destroyed the social fabric.”This was one of the main concerns cited by various RWAs during the public consultation held by the DDA last year for the preparation of the MPD-2041, which will be soon put in the public domain.Mixed land use regulationsIn the aftermath of largescale sealing and demolition of commercial establishments operating from residential areas in 2006, mixed land use was allowed by the Centre and regulations were introduced in the MPD-2021 that was notified on February 7, 2007.As per provisions, commercial activities were allowed in residential areas based on the category of the colony (A to H), right of way (ROW) available and the extent of commercialisation.The colony roads were declared as commercial, mixed land use and pedestrian streets based on the above-mentioned criteria. Till date, the city’s three municipal corporations have declared close to 3,000 streets as commercial, mixed land use and pedestrian streets in the city. Commercial activity is allowed on all floors of a residential plot located on a commercial street, while commercial activity is restricted to the ground floor only in case of a mixed land use road.Shamsher Singh, former chief town planner with erstwhile Municipal Corporation of Delhi, said, “All activities of a local shopping complex were allowed in residential areas where streets were notified as commercial, mixed land use and pedestrian streets. It was not a planning input, but was introduced to mitigate the hardships faced by commercial establishments due to sealing and demolition.”One of the governing principles for mixed use development as per MPD-2021 was to “mitigate the associated adverse impact related to congestion, increased traffic and increased pressure on civic amenities”.Singh said that commercial establishments operating from residential areas had to pay conversion and parking charges and the civic agencies were to provide for parking and other civic amenities. “But the consequences were not well thought of. Today, it is one of the main reasons for the parking mess in residential areas,” said Singh.While municipal corporations have constructed multilevel parking lots in various parts of the city, Singh said, area specific requirements have to be met.A good concept, but poorly executed Globally, mixed land use is hailed as a good planning concept for a sustainable development of a city. Cities such as Toronto, London, Hong Kong, Portland etc., have mixed use development. The recent Transit Oriented Development policy, which will soon be notified in Delhi, is also aimed at mixed land use development.Urban planners say that MLU is a good concept, but it wasn’t implemented properly in Delhi.AK Jain, former planning commissioner with DDA, who was involved in the preparation of MPD-2021, said, “It is a good concept and important for sustainable development of the city. When this concept was introduced in the MPD-2021, there were many provisions kept for its successful implementation. But unfortunately, those were not implemented due to which it has been haphazard.”He added, “In MLU roads, the owners of commercial establishments were to surrender the front setback free of cost. But this has not happened. Even if they have surrendered the front setback, they have their own guards managing the parking facility. Another important provision was regarding parking facilities. The civic agencies despite collecting conversion and parking charges have failed to provide adequate parking.”Chaudhury Hukum Chand Marg in south Delhi’s Green Park Extension is a case in point. Neha Puri, general secretary of Green Park Extension RWA, said that ever since the road was declared mixed land use, diagnostic labs, nursing homes and other commercial activities have come up due to which there is congestion and parking problems.Puri, whose house is located on the road, said, “The traffic in the area has increased due to opening of these diagnostic centres and other commercial units. There is no proper parking provision and vehicles are parked on roads resulting in congestion. It is impossible for residents to walk. The civic infrastructure, which was designed for a residential colony, is strained due to rampant commercialisation of residential areas.”Sanjukkta Bhaduri, professor of urban planning and dean research at the School of Planning and Architecture, said that the problems arising out of MLU implementations were bound to happen. “In western countries, mixed use is part of their planning from the start. But when you superimpose something over an existing area, conflict is bound to happen. Mixed use development has to be allowed based on the typology of the area,” said Bhaduri.Planned commercial spacesOne of main reasons for rampant commercialisation in residential areas, Bhaduri said, is growing demand for commercial spaces at affordable prices in the city. DDA, which is responsible for planned development of the city, has developed close to 600 district, community and local shopping centres in the city. “But these are not enough to cater to the city’s growing population. Development of planned commercial spaces has not kept pace with the demand for it. Not many commercial centres have been developed by the DDA since the MPD-2021 was notified in 2007. This is one of the reasons why commercial units have opened in residential areas,” said Praveen Khandelwal, secretary general of Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT).And those who bought shops and plots in DDA-developed commercial centres say that these centres have failed to pick up due to MLU provisions. While the permissible Floor Area Ratio (FAR) in planned commercial centres is 125, commercial establishments operating in residential areas get up to 350 FAR, depending on plot size, said Som Prakash Rehil, owner of a property in DDA-developed community shopping centre in Pitampura.Spread over four acres of prime land near Road No. 44 in Pitampura, the three to four storeyed DDA Commercial Complex, has been under-utilised for nearly two decades. The centre, which was developed by private developers on land auctioned by the DDA in the late 1990s, is surrounded by markets which are operating in residential areas.“We bought the properties at commercial rates. But today, we are struggling to revive the complex. There is no demand for our properties, as commercial space with higher Floor Area Ratio (FAR) is available on the main roads. Even banks are not ready to come here. The complex is lying in a state of neglect,” said Rehil, president of Commercial Complex road no. 44 Pitampura association.The situation is the same in most DDA markets. The DDA Market Joint Action Committee, an association of close to 200 DDA local and community shopping centres in Delhi, has written to the DDA demanding FAR at par with commercial complexes that have come up in mixed land use areas in the new MPD.Yashpal, executive member of the DDA Market Joint Action Committee, said, “This anomaly in the master plan should be addressed. Commercial activity in planned areas should be encouraged and for this higher FAR which is currently being given to commercial properties in mixed land use areas.”Another reason for low demand for commercial spaces in DDA markets is the cost of cost factor, said urban planners.Jain said, “DDA needs to reduce the cost of its commercial properties and bring it at par with market rates. Why will anyone buy a shop in DDA markets where the FAR is less when they can get higher FAR at cheaper rates in residential areas?”The way forwardUrban planners say that mixed land use is not a new concept in India. Hitesh Vaidya, director, National Institute of Urban Affairs (NIUA), said, “Indian cities have historically been planned on a mix use philosophy. Not only old heritage cities such as Shahjahanabad (Walled City) or Varanasi, but also planned cities like Jaipur were based on a mixed use concept. This helped to integrate lower floors of houses into the commercial and cultural landscape of the surrounding fabric, thereby creating vibrant, safe and socially cohesive neighbourhoods.”NIUA, a research and advisory body to the Ministry of housing and urban affairs, has been roped in by the DDA to prepare the MPD-2041. While experts say that MLU is a good concept and much needed in today’s time, they say there is a need for more detailed planning and impact assessment while allowing if.R Srinivas, town and country planner, Town and Country Planning Organisation, said, “Before allowing mixed land use, it is important to do impact assessment as to check whether the area will be able to take the load due to increase in footfall and vehicular movement etc. Impact assessment should be done not just of the road where commercial activity is being allowed but of neighbouring areas as well.”Parking is one of the biggest challenges in the implementation of mixed land use. Srinivas said, “There should be restriction on parking in mixed land use areas and pedestrian movement should be encouraged.”For this, local area plans and layout plans of colonies should be prepared. Bhaduri said, “New commercial spaces are coming up in residential colonies as there is demand for it. This also provides security, as there are no eyes on the streets. But to strike a balance, there is a need to have local area plans.”Singh added, “There is a need to prepare the layout of residential colonies before approving mixed land use. MLU should be discouraged in areas around planned commercial spaces. Also, sites for parking provisions should be earmarked.”Mixed use remains relevant in today’s times when mono functional land use planning has resulted in unsustainable urban sprawl, long trip distances and unnecessary motorised trips, unsafe neighbourhoods with no eyes on the street, etc, said Vaidya.“Pandemics such as the Covid 19 reinforce the urgent need to reintroduce this planning paradigm so that smaller self-sustaining and multi-use neighbourhoods can be created that can easily be converted into isolation zones when required….We can make mixed land use relevant for our cities today through careful neighbourhood planning so that congestion is avoided, as well as planning of city level mixed use hubs and clusters closer to transit systems that can act as future economic and cultural hubs of the city,” said Vaidya.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/mixed-land-use-rules-changed-delhi-now-residents-want-them-reviewed-101618220676919.html
12-04-2021||Bhopal||Madhya Pradesh govt offers space to private hospitals for Covid-19 treatment||The Madhya Pradesh government has offered to provide space to private hospitals to set up their medical facilities in a bid to increase the number of beds for Covid-19 patients, chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan said on Monday.Talking to reporters here, Chouhan also said the supply of Remdevisir injections would be normalised within the next two or three days as the government has started procuring the key anti-viral drug.The demand for the drug has gone up in the wake of a surge in Covid-19 cases.The CM said the viral infection can be controlled if people adopt Covid-appropriate behaviour."I believe that instead of a lockdown in cities, people should lock their faces with masks and lock themselves in their homes tocontrol the spread of the viral infection," Chouhan said.He said the state has also placed an order for 2,000 oxygen concentrators (a medical device that filters surrounding air and delivers purified medical grade oxygen) for adequate supply of the oxygen to the Covid-19 patients."We have made an offer to private hospitals that we will provide them space and they should start their own medical set up there," Chouhan said.Some people have given a positive response and discussions are going on with them, he informed."We want to increase the number of beds at any cost," Chouhan said after planting a sapling at the Smart City Garden in Bhopal.To tackle the Covid-19 situation, the state government has placed an order for 2,000 oxygen concentrators, he said."The concentrator will also be used along with the oxygen cylinder. The government is trying to ensured that there is no shortage of necessary equipmentand medicines," Chouhan said.Asked about the board exams of Classes 10 and 12, Chouhan said the dates for exams conducted by the MP Board of Secondary Education have not yet been announced.A decision will be taken after assessing the Covid-19 situation, he said, adding that the government will not let the students be affected.On Sunday, Madhya Pradesh recorded 5,939 fresh coronavirus cases, the biggest single-day spike since the pandemic began, which pushed the infection count to 3,38,145, officials said.The fatality count rose to 4,184 with 24 more deaths reported on Sunday.This month, the state has so far recorded 42,634 new cases of the viral infection and 198 fatalities, as per official data.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/madhya-pradesh-govt-offers-space-to-private-hospitals-for-covid-19-treatment-101618219520464.html

12-04-2021||Mumbai||Covid-19 containment work in Maharashtra districts 'sub-optimal': Central teams||The Central teams deputed to Maharashtra to coordinate the response to the coronavirus pandemic have observed that containment operations were sub- optimal in Satara, Sangli and Aurangabad districts, says a report sent by the Centre to the state government.The teams found "less than satisfactory perimeter control and lack of active surveillance" in Covid-19 cases, the report sent by the Union Health Ministry said."Efforts at surveillance and contact tracing were found to be sub-optimal in Buldhana, Satara, Aurangabad and Nanded, mostly due to limited manpower engaged in this task. The team from Bhandara has reported that most cases are being reported from outside of containment zones," the report said.The report addressed to Maharashtra's Principal Secretary (Health) Pradeep Vyas, said the ministry has been actively engaging with the state government in coordinating and collaborating efforts towards preparedness and response to the pandemic.The Centre has sent Central teams to the 30 most affected districts in Maharashtra and these teams are working with the district administration to understand the spread of Covid-19, provide support and supervision and suggest workable solutions to curb the spread, the report said.The teams have been tasked to work with the district authorities on preparedness and response with a focus on testing, contact tracing and containment operations, Covid- appropriate behaviour and its enforcement, hospital infrastructure and availability of logistic and vaccination progress, the report said."The testing capacity in Satara, Bhandara, Palghar, Amravati, Jalna and Latur districts is already overwhelmed, resulting in a delay in reporting of test results," the report said."The Central teams from Nanded and Buldhana have reported a very skewed RT-PCR/RAT ratio. Community resistance to Covid-19 testing has also been reported from the Bhandara district. ln Bhandara and Satara a large percentage of Covid- 19 patients are under home isolation, which requires rigorous follow up to minimize mortality. Such a follow up is not happening presently," it said.It was also observed that delayed reporting by patients to definitive treatment centres in Satara district is leading to a large number of deaths within the first few hours of hospital admission, the report said."Occupancy rates of available hospital bed capacity are very high in Ahmednagar, Aurangabad, Nagpur and Nandurbar districts. The team to Aurangabad reported dependency of the district on neighbouring districts for management of critical patients and critical care infrastructure up-gradation thereon," the report said."Medical oxygen supply was found to be an issue in Bhandara, Palqhar, Osmanabad and Pune. Malfunctioning ventilators have been reported by teams from Satara and Latur districts.

Seven persons, including the main accused in the lynching case, have been arrested so far, said officials.Kishanganj SP Kumar Ashish said, “The police team accompanying the SHO during the raid in Bengal, escaped, leaving the SHO alone,” adding, “This action on their part has discredited the police and hence stringent action will be taken against the erring cops.”The SHO, who was leading the raiding party, was beaten, strangled to death and his body left at Pantapara village under Goalpokhar police station area in West Bengal’s North Dinajpur district early on Saturday, said a police official. He was declared brought dead at the Islampur hospital in the district.Raju Sahni, Akhileshwar Tiwari, Pramod Kumar Paswan, Ujjawal Paswan, Sunil Choudhary, Sushil Kumar and circle inspector Manish Kumar were suspended by Purnia range inspector general of police (IGP) Suresh Choudhary on Saturday for allegedly abandoning Kumar, who was surrounded by the mob.“We recommended for their (seven cops including circle inspector) suspension and the IG has placed them under suspension and departmental action will be initiated against them,” said Kishanganj superintendent of police (SP) Kumar Ashish.Bengal police has registered a case under Sections 147, 148, 149, (All three related to rioting and mob lynching), 326 (voluntarily causing grievous hurt by dangerous weapons), 332 (voluntarily causing hurt to deter public servant from his duty) and 302 (murder) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) at Golpokhar police station. Kishanganj police have also lodged a case under Section 394 (voluntarily causing hurt while committing robbery) of the IPC.SP Choudhary said main accused Firoz Alam was among the seven arrested in the SHO lynching case and raids were still being carried out to nab the remaining accused.The failed Saturday raid was carried out on Choudhary’s instructions to all police stations in Kishanganj to arrest the bike-snatching gang. During the last six months, over a dozen incidents of bike snatching were reported from Kishanganj. Bihar Police team decided to carry out the operation in West Bengal after learning that the gang members were hiding there, taking advantage of the jurisdictional restrictions. The village where the lynching took place is about 8 kms from Kishanganj.The SP alleged that the Bengal police didn’t cooperate in the operation initially. “Bengal police were duly informed before conducting the raid but unfortunately no Bengal police personnel reached at the site despite frequent phone calls made by the police team,” the SP said.Superintendent of Islampur police district earlier said they had requested Bihar Police team to wait and reschedule the raid. “The team had come to us around 2:30 am on Saturday . As elections were going on in the state and our men were already deployed, we requested them to reschedule the raid. We never knew that they went ahead with the raid. We have already arrested a few accused. It is a very unfortunate and tragic incident,” said Sachin Makkar, SP, Islampur.The slain SHO was a resident of Jankinagar in Purnia and is survived by his wife Meenu Sneh Lata and three children. His mother died on Sunday morning after hearing of his son’s death. Last rites of both mother and son were performed in their native village at Panchu Mandal Tola in the presence of senior police and administrative officers and hundreds of people late Sunday afternoon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/7-bihar-cops-suspended-for-laxity-in-sho-lynching-case-7-accused-held-101618210956673.html

Nancy also demanded a CBI probe into the incident.“We want a Central Bureau of Investigation probe into this matter as they all (seven Bihar police personnel) including the circle inspector, Manish Kumar, left my father alone to die” Nancy said, adding that all the accused involved in the lynching should be given capital punishment. 50-year-old Ashwani Kumar, in-charge station house officer (SHO) of Kishanganj police station in Kishanganj district was brutally beaten and throttled to death by a mob at Pantapara village under Goalpokhar police station of North Dinajpur district in neighbouring West Bengal early on Saturday, said inspector general of police (IGP) Purnia range Suresh Choudhary. The SHO was leading a raid party to arrest the kingpin of a motorcycle lifting gang active in Bihar’s Seemanchal region, comprising four districts of Purnia, Katihar, Araria besides Kishanganj. The attack on the SHO was triggered by the kingpin of the gang, Firoz Alam, who incited around 500-strong mob. Kumar died on the spot. “We have lost a brave and upright police officer,” said the IG.His 70-year-old mother Urmila Devi couldn’t bear the loss and died on Sunday morning. Slain police officer’s 6-year-old son Ansh lit his father’s funeral pyre, while his 15-year-old daughter Nancy stood beside her brother. Praveen Kumar, younger brother of the slain SHO, lit the funeral pyre of Urmila Devi at Panchu Tola under Jankinagar police station, about 45 kms from Purnia district headquarters.Kumar was survived by wife Minu Snehlata, 45, and three children including two daughters and a son. The family lived in a rented house at Hanuman Nagar, Kankarbagh, Patna.Earlier, divisional commissioner of Purnia Rahul Ranjan Mahiwal read out the condolence message from the Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar and assured the bereaved family of justice and all possible assistance from the state government. Mahiwal said Bihar director general of police (DGP) K S Singhal had spoken to his Bengal counterpart P Nirajnayan for stringent action. So far seven accused in the lynching case have been arrested by Bengal police.IG Choudhary added that Bihar and Bengal police were carrying out joint operations to nab the accused. He added that all police personnel in the Purnia division will give a-day’s salary, collectively amounting to ₹50 lakh, to Kumar’s family. Officials at the state headquarters said his kith will get ex-gratia payment, services benefits and a government job (for one family member).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-sho-lynched-in-bengal-cremated-with-mother-daughter-seeks-cbi-probe-101618210356343.html

12-04-2021||Delhi||No such thing as too many flats!||The pandemic changed the way we define style and fashion. The limited gatherings during festivals also affected the way people dress-up. Comfort became priority, and a growing number of women swapped their killer heels for stylish yet sensible footwear. The sales of high heels had gone down by 70% in 2020. Beth Goldstein, an analyst of footwear and fashion trends for New York’s NPD Group said, ‘Uncomfortable footwear was losing popularity before the pandemic.’ The trend continues in 2021 with comfort and ease still being the priority for people. Recently, author Anuja Chauhan called out long heels in one of her Facebook posts, “Ladies, you want to assert your power and regain your agency? STOP teetering about in pointy heeled ‘sexy’ shoes. They’re impractical and they slow you down and in the long run they mess up your spine. Sure, they make you look taller, but frankly, they also make you look stupider, as you’re clearly trading in comfort and health and speed just for 2-3 (or 4!) inches of faux height. Work on your fitness and your posture and do your homework well before you enter any meeting, and you’ll tower over everybody else present just with sheer personality.” Flats were also seen in various fashion shows across the world. Brands such as Valentino, Dior, Celine, Lanvin and Simone Rocha teamed their Spring Summer 2021 collections with the most fabulous looking flats. “The core idea is that even when you look down, and see your feet, you feel happy. People have begun choosing footwear that is comfortable and easy to wear without compromising on style,” says Laksheeta Govil of Fizzy Goblet. It’s truly a personal choice when it comes to heel height but choosing a pair with less dip/incline is always a better choice, says experts. “Despite confinement, consumers are still interested in fashion. Our sales in the post lockdown months showed that customers were seeking a balanced combination of comfort and style. Immediately after the first easing of restrictions in July/August last year, we saw an increase in the orders for flat styles which showed a noticeable shift of preference from more stylish to more comfortable designs,” says Aprajita Toor who makes handicraft footwear. Some of the brands had even reworked on the comfort level during the pandemic. “We ensure every design is able to give maximum support and cushion and reworked on them. Since the lockdown has gotten over and people are now stepping out for work, the priority has again come back to wearing something that is comfortable but elegant at the same time,” says Shweta Nimkar, Founder of PAIO Shoes. And flats are not just for daily wear. Fashion lovers are opting for flats even for special occasion, as there’s no dearth of great looking, party-worthy options to choose from. Fashion designer, Rina Dhaka, says she has always been in love with flats. “The new breed of flats have made me get over my love affair with some of the world’s best heels in my closet, which I duly collected over the years as investment pieces. Sneakers, espadrilles and slip-ons are my favourites. I like the fact that the sneaker trend stayed, because nothing like a pair of sneakers tucked under the brides lehenga.” Designer Payal Pratap who is showcasing handmade two-tone leather flats in her Spring Summer 2021 collection, says, “I’m a flats person and always have been. I relish them with everything I wear. Get the right design and colour and you can make them work with every look. Open sandals are so comfortable and trendy, too. For formals, you could try chic pointed toe flats.” Model-actor Soundarya Sharma agrees that with so many alluring options available, there is no way the look can go wrong with flats. “Fashion to me is more about being myself rather than following a stereotype. That’s why I love flats. A long skirt with a slit looks great with flat with high boots, one can wear a tight fitted long formal skirt with loafers and sneakers for a fun look, or short skirts with ballerinas or lace-up flats while kurti and juttis are an evergreen combo,” says Sharma. You can wear flats with even lehengas, if you choose the right design. “Lehengas holds a heavy ken-ken and wearing flats can ease out the burden. One can find a variety of flats, right from the bejeweled to the embroidered ones to team with lehengas,” says fashion designer Gautam Gupta. And what better occasion than Holi to bring out your pretty flats? “Holi is one such festival when the fun element gets a notch higher and you seek comfort, too, which is the new cool. I love wearing pom-pom slippers and colourful kohlapuri with white churidaar suit. A vibrant dupatta adds to the beauty of the look,” says model-actor Sone Kanwar. Tips to ace the look 1. Pointed toe fancy flats can be paired with glamarous vintage inspired gowns. For a party look, you can also go for a sparkly pair of flats that look chic and classy. Even metallics are great for evening wear or red carpet look.2. For a fun, desi twist to your look, team your kurtis with jeans and wear a vibrant jutti or a kolhapuri. It’s an evergreen look that won’t let you down. 3. Sneakers are the best form of flats gifted to us. Fearlessly pair a stylish sneaker with any of your outfits including a pant suit or even a sari. And you can always wear your favourite pair of flat ankle boots with your short, cute dresses.(Inputs by stylist Aakanksha Kapoor) Author tweets@ruchikagarg271Follow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/no-such-thing-as-too-many-flats-101618205558462.html
12-04-2021||Delhi||Uttarakhand cuisine: food fit for gods||The land of captivating hills, glistening rivers and clear sky offers a smorgasbord of delightful flavours. The exquisite pahadi food from the regions of Kumaun and Garhwal in Uttarakhand has drawn inspiration from myriad culture and cuisines. “The state border is connected with Tibet, Nepal, Uttar Pradesh and Haryana. From the Sikhs to the British, it was home to many and every community left an impact on the state’s cuisine,” says Pawan Bisht, corporate chef, One8 Commune, who recently did an Uttarakhand food pop up.The produce in the lush green hills of Uttarakhand are free from adulteration. Food is made with ingredients either grown locally or found in the wild ,and freshness makes the food nutritious. “The region with its clean air and unexploited farm land, irrigated with clean unpolluted water produce plenty of millets, herbs, organic lentils and vegetables that are beautifully incorporated in the cuisine,” says Sidharth Sharma, corporate chef, Moonshine Food Ventures.The abundance of herbs, therapeutic spices, wild fruits and vegetables makes Uttarakhand food one of the healthiest cuisines. “Organic consumption directly from the kitchen gardens makes the food rich in antioxidants that help in reducing oxidative stress. The green vegetable punarnava popularly eaten in the state (which literally means ‘something that replenishes the body’) is believed to cure insomnia and many other diseases,” says Bisht who belongs to Chhoi, a village in Nainital district.There is limited use of spices in pahadi cuisine. Hence the natural flavours of the food are retained. “The unique grains and lentils and the simple rustic peasant like approach towards the cuisine sets it apart. Ingredients such as amaranth (cholai) along with sorghum are used with young ginger and molasses,” says Shanti Prasad, chef in JW Marriott, New Delhi.The cooking techniques are also simple, focusing on retaining the natural juices and flavours of food. Food is braised and boiled rather than fried. “Choru (Angelica glauca) is used to make a stew-like mutton dish with crushed red chili, turmeric and seasoning, where the pot is put on fire in the morning and left to cook slowly,” says Sharma.Earlier, people used desi chulha, khadd cooking (pit roast), bhatti, and gobar gas to cook vegetarian and non vegetarian food. “Traditionally, Bhaddu (a vessel made of alloy with a narrow neck and heavy bottom) was used to cook lentils or meats which has now been replaced by pressure cookers. Using the old methods brings out the most delightful flavours,” says Sharma.Mountains provide different ingredients in different seasons, giving vivid flavours to the inhabitants. “Winter is famous for dried products especially for dishes made of dried bitter gourd, Kulth ki dal, Gainthi ki sabzi, kakri ki badi and dried meat ‘Suksa’. Spring brings plenty of fresh vegetables and summer is all about linguda-a type of fern, leafy vegetables like rai saag and palak (spinach),” says Sharma.Phaanu is another popular dish. It’s made of soaked and grounded black bean tempered with faran leaves. Locals have it with rice or roti. Another interesting dish is Rus. It’s different kind of lentils grown together to save time and effort. It includes bhatt (black soya bean), gahat/kulath and chana. Kafuli is yet another traditional dish, a kind of kadhi made with grounded barnyard millet, curd and radish leaves. Chainsoo curry, made of soaked split black dal, tempered with ghee and jakhya seeds, thickened with whole wheat flour is also a popular dish.The meals are paired with tangy chutneys. Bhang is grown in abundance in this region and the hemp seeds are used to make the traditional chutney. “Til ki chutney made from roasted sesame seeds and green chilies is also very popular,” says Bhagwad Singh, chef in JW Marriott. Makoy ( berries) ki chutney, Bhatt (black soya bean) ki chutney and Galgal (Hill lemon) chutney are also flavourful accompaniments to the meal.Recipe CHAUNKIYA MATAR AUR AKHROT KE SIDDUINGREDIENTSWhole wheat flour: 500 gmsDry yeast: ½ tspSalt: To tasteSugar: 5 gmsFresh green peas: 100 gmsWalnuts: 100 gmsJeera: 1 tspHaldi: ½ tspDesi ghee: 100 gmsGinger: 20 gmsFresh coriander: 1 tbspGreen chili: 2 no.sMETHOD1.

12-04-2021||Delhi||Amid rising Covid cases, Delhi begins sixth round of sero-survey today||Amid rising cases of coronavirus disease (Covid-19), Delhi government will begin collecting blood samples for the sixth round of serological surveillance from today to determine the change in the population-level prevalence of antibodies against Sar-CoV-2 between January and April. The last round of surveillance, for which samples were collected between January 11 and 21, found just over 56% of Delhi residents had been exposed to the virus.The prevalence of antibodies had more than doubled from 25.5% during the October round of survey to January, largely owing to the huge third wave of cases seen in November when 8,593 cases had been reported in a single day at the peak.The current wave has crossed the previous record, with 10,774 cases being reported in a day on April 11. The current round of sero survey will see just over 100 samples being collected from each of 272 municipal wards in Delhi, totalling 28,000. The researchers from Maulana Azad Medical College will also take history of vaccination from all the participants.Also Read | India’s Covid-19 tally crosses 13.52 million with 168,912 fresh infectionsThe current serological survey uses qualitative tests that can tell whether a person has detectable antibodies against Sars-CoV-2 virus that causes Covid-19 or not. It does not, however, detect the levels of the antibodies or the neutralising effect of it.A recent study by scientists from Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology found that over 17% of those who had detectable antibodies lost the ability to effectively neutralise the virus at six months. Another 4.6% lost the antibodies all together after six months.In June-end, when the first sero surveillance was conducted, 22.6% of the 21,000 people sampled had antibodies. This shot to 29.1% of the 15,000 people sampled in August, and then dropped to 25.1% among the 17,000 people sampled in September (due to a change in methodology and dropping antibody levels in the population, the researchers said). In October, it went up to 25.5% in a sample size of 15,000.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/amid-rising-covid-cases-delhi-begins-sixth-round-of-sero-survey-today-101618200876181.html

12-04-2021||Delhi||Fire in GK-2 residential building, 5 rescued||Firefighters rescued five people from a fire in a two-storey residential building in south Delhi’s Greater Kailash 2, early on Sunday. There were no casualties in the blaze, which broke out on the first floor of the building, while all the five rescued were trapped on the second.The incident was reported to the Delhi Fire Services (DFS) around 4am, after which four tenders were rushed to the spot.Director DFS, Atul Garg said, “It looked like the fire started in one of the five air-conditioners on the first floor. Since there was a lot of smoke on the staircase, it was difficult for the occupants of the building to escape. Our personnel entered the building wearing hazmat suits and rescued five persons one by one, safely. None of them were injured,” Garg said.The five rescued persons were all examined and were out of danger, he said.The fire was also doused after an hour. “Since it was a residential area, our focus was to not let the blaze spread to adjoining buildings,” Garg said.In another incident on Sunday morning, 200 furniture shops were gutted after a fire at Shastri Park furniture market. While no casualties were reported, hundreds of pieces of furniture were lost in the fire.The fire broke out around 12.45am.Garg said they sent 27 fire tenders and more than 1,000 firefighters to contain the fire. “It took us more than three hours to douse the fire. Cooling operations continued for even longer. No casualties were reported in the incident because the market was vacant when the fire spread across the market. But because a lot of wooden material was stashed in these shops, it was difficult for our personnel to stop the fire from spreading,” Garg said.He said they are still ascertaining the cause of the fire.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/fire-in-gk-2-residential-building-5-rescued-101618172609637.html
12-04-2021||Mumbai||After crime branch, Mumbai Police's EOW officials to face 'clean up'||After the crime branch, the Economic Offenses Wing (EOW) of Mumbai Police could be the next department to face a 'clean up' drive initiated by the new Mumbai commissioner of police Hemant Nagrale, said people privy to the development.Nagrale, who has taken up the uphill task of cleaning up the city police force and shunted out over 65 crime branch officers (who served in the crime branch for over five years), has now decided to give a similar treatment to the EOW.Generally, a police officer is supposed to serve at a post for three years and then transferred to another posting, however, people aware of the developments in the EOW said some officers have been in the department for over six years merely by switching their postings within the department during transfers. Now, all these officers would be moved out to other police departments, which could be local police stations or side branches.“Once such officers are transferred, about 45-50% posts of EOW officers would go vacant. These posts would be filled up with the new officers,” said an EOW officer, requesting anonymity.Read more: Mumbai Police officer Riyaz Kazi arrested by NIA, agency says he helped Sachin Vaze in Antilia bomb scare conspiracyThe EOW officers expecting transfers are now busy winding up old cases which are with them for years, HT has learnt.Unlike the sudden order for the crime branch and its immediate implementation, the transfers in the EOW would be effected during regular general transfers in June. “Immediate remedial measures with the crime branch were need of the hour to send a strong message across a particular department, but same was not the case with the EOW,” said a police officer from the headquarters.Joint commissioner of police (EOW) Niket Kaushik, who is known for his upright approach in decision making, recently issued an order to all EOW unit heads, hinting at the possible transfers. Kaushik's order (a copy of which is with HT) stated, "Possible transfers of those officers who are completing four years in EOW as of May 31, 2021, cannot be ruled out in upcoming general transfers (which occurs every year in June). Hence all unit heads are hereby directed that henceforth not to give such officers the investigation of new cases."After controversies surrounding the crime branch’s tainted officer Sachin Vaze and former police commissioner Param Bir Singh's transfer, the Maharashtra government in mid-March entrusted DGP Hemant Nagrale with the responsibility of bringing back the lost glory of Mumbai Police.Read more: Central Railway files complaint against fake video of overcrowding at Mumbai stationsAfter taking charge on March 17, Nagrale started by taking on those cops who might have had developed proximity with unwarranted elements by enjoying long tenure in the same department. Within six days of joining, he shunted out 65 crime branch officers.Explaining these transfers Rajkumar Vhatkar, joint commissioner of police (Administration) said, “The transfers of policemen are governed by the Police Act where the prescribed service tenure is defined. Since crime branch officers require special skills which are acquired out of experience in the field, they were kept in the branch for a long time for administrative convenience. But of late, it is observed that some of the officers developed vested interests. Hence, objective criteria was applied and all the officers who completed five years in the branch at a stretch or have over 10 years of service with some break in between, have been transferred out.”By inducting new officers in the branch, the department feels some fresh perspective can be brought in, which will help strengthen the crime branch and infuse zeal and enthusiasm.Read more: Anil Deshmukh's staff questioned by CBI in probe over Param Bir Singh’s allegationsAnother senior IPS officer said, “The commissioner's clean up drive aims to uproot the nexus or connivance of policemen with the wrong elements that ultimately encourage corruption in the police department. Such nexus or connivance makes policemen overconfident and makes them indulge in unethical practices which eventually could lead to another API Sachin Vaze-like episode that has brought tremendous embarrassment, shame and disrepute to Mumbai Police, once considered a highly reputed police force in the country."Citing Vaze's example, a senior IPS officer said that he was given a completely free hand by former commissioner Singh and was so patronised by his godfather that he had become super arrogant. “He would come to the police headquarters in high-end private cars, issue orders to officers in any department, not respecting colleagues and not even saluting the senior police officers. Such arrogance makes a policeman more vulnerable in breaching the discipline,” a senior officer said on condition of anonymity.Those policemen who have been serving at the police stations of Mumbai for over five years will also be transferred and would be posted at side branches soon. “If a policeman serves at a post for a longer period then he forms groups around him and is bound to indulge in unethical practices, therefore transfers are necessary, another senior IPS officer said. The process has already been started with the constabulary at several police stations,” the officer added.HT has learnt that not just the crime branch and the EOW but many other important departments at the headquarters would also be covered under the move. “Police personnel posted at various departments that look after the licensing and permissions for dance bars, permit rooms, hotels and other establishments would also be transferred if serving at the same office for long period,” said an officer."Transferring policemen doesn't mean that all those who have been transferred are corrupt. Many of them served the force exceptionally well and earned respect, name and fame. The practice (of transfers) is aimed at sending out a message that it is the system that has made them big and achieve expertise in a field, and not vice versa. No one is above the system. Others should also get the opportunity to hone their skills and serve society. Overstaying at one post make policemen vulnerable to wrongful and unethical practices, who then willingly or unwillingly become part of the system designed to benefit wrong people," said another IPS officer.When asked about other measures he plans to take to bring back the lost pride of Mumbai Police and retain people's faith in the force, Nagrale said, “You'll (soon) know when it's done.”He refused to elaborate further on the transfer’s strategy in the EOW and other departments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/after-crime-branch-mumbai-police-s-eow-officials-to-face-clean-up-101618170338815.html
12-04-2021||Delhi||Delhi: Civic bodies, PWD make drains monsoon-ready||To prevent waterlogging during monsoon this year, civic bodies and Public Works Department (PWD) have started cleaning drains alongside roads. Officials of north and south civic bodies said that work has already begun in their areas while it was yet to pick up pace in areas under the East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC).While the three civic bodies collectively manage over 400km of small and medium drains along its roads and in residential neighbourhoods, the major drains are mostly managed by the PWD.Last year, the desilting of drains by municipal bodies and PWD was delayed by over 1.5 months — starting only towards the end of May — due to the coronavirus lockdown and the subsequent shortage of labour. The delay had led to massive waterlogging in many parts of the city during monsoon. In July 2020, a 56-year-old man drowned after his mini-truck submerged under the Minto bridge in central Delhi.This year, the north and south corporations called meetings on the issue well ahead of the work schedule and officials were told to finish work on getting the drains monsoon ready by the end of May.“Unlike last year, we have started the process of desilting drains from last week of March. Small drains are being cleaned currently and after this, bigger ones will be taken up. We have set a deadline of May-end to complete the work. Necessary instructions have also been issued to officials in a meeting last week. Our priority is to clean drains before the onset of the monsoon...,” said Jai Prakash, mayor of North MCD.A senior official of the north corporation said that the civic body manages nearly 192 drains, measuring about 200km, in its jurisdiction. “Desilting of drains was started in March last week. Till Thursday, 13% work has been completed. We are hoping to finish it by May 31 or latest in June first week,” said the official, who wished not to be named.Normally, monsoon in Delhi sets in by the last week of June.Officials said that it takes over two months to clean small, medium and large drains which makes it important to start the process in March.According to SDMC officials, the municipality manages 269 drains measuring 183.75 km in its jurisdiction. “We have already started cleaning of 138 small and medium drains and work on remaining drains will start soon. Till last week, we had completed 20% desilting process and removed 74.25 metric tonnes of silt from drains. Desilting of nullahs, which are deeper than four feet, have also been started. The process will be completed by May 31,” said a senior SDMC official, requesting anonymity.However, cleaning of drains under EDMC is yet to begin properly.EDMC mayor Nirmal Jain said, “From next week, we will focus more on desilting work. Small drains are being cleaned but due to coronavirus vaccination and other works, major desilting drive will start from the coming week.”Officials said that there are over 100km drains spread across roads under EDMC jurisdiction.Apart from the three MCDs, PWD and some other agencies manage drains alongside roads in their jurisdiction. PWD officials said it manages 2,050 km of drains along 1,260 km of road across 17 divisions in the city.The officials said that the desilting work had begun earlier this month. “The desilting of drains was started towards the first week of April. It is still in the early stages... We are dedicated to complete the process latest by June 15, before the arrival of monsoon,” a PWD official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-civic-bodies-pwd-make-drains-monsoonready-101618172364587.html
12-04-2021||Delhi||Delhi Police revamps training unit, launch new courses||The Delhi Police have introduced courses such as perception-building, public outreach, investigation in cases of missing children and sexual offences and prevention and detection of crime in the refresher and promotional courses for both trainee and serving officers, officials aware of the matter said.Senior officers said that for the first time, posting of officials in the training branch has been incentivised and only those willing to serve will be selected through a committee. The committee will review the performance of the staff, after every six months and non-performers will be transferred out, they said.They said on completion of a three-year tenure in training unit, officers will be given a choice in posting.While 115 courses have already been conducted by the training branch of Delhi Police and 6,520 officers have attended the basic, promotional and refresher training courses, 14 courses are underway for 3,350 personnel.Delhi police commissioner SN Shrivastava said emphasis was being laid on upgrading training modules. “This year, new subjects have been introduced such as courses on functioning of various technological applications, perception building and public outreach, courses on investigation in cases involving missing children and sexual offences, and even short courses for station house officers (SHOs) like redressal of grievances, satisfaction of visitors to police stations and overall improvement in the working of a police station,” he said.Explaining the need for incentivising posting in the training branch, Shrivastava said, “In training unit, there is nothing quantifiable to show and it is not a very glamorous posting. Usually, it is perceived that posting to the training branch is a punishment. In order to change this perception, we are incentivising posting to the branch and to bring in better talent only suitable officers will be selected for the job,” he said.Shrivastava said surveillance, prevention and detection of crime and beat system of patrolling is another newly introduced focus area in training.Other courses include cyber crime investigation, use of stun and taser guns, effective crowd management, usage of force, etc.Delhi police spokesperson Chinmoy Biswal said the officers selected for the training branch will have a tenure of three years, which will be extendable by two years.“The extension will be done after considering the officer’s overall performance in training unit. After successful completion of the tenure, officers will be given a choice in posting. Officers will also be allowed to specialise in a training area of their choice both in India and abroad in collaboration with Bureau of Police Research and Development,” Biswal said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-police-revamps-training-unit-launch-new-courses-101618172460327.html

Seeing no way out, police said the accused allegedly admitted that they killed the accused during a fight over regularly using foul language.The murder came to light on April 5, when a call was received at Mangolpuri police station regarding a man lying injured in a park near Outer Ring Road. A police team that reached the spot found that the man had been bludgeoned to death. His body was moved to a mortuary for post mortem examination and a case of murder was registered.Deputy commissioner of police (outer) Parvinder Singh said the victim was identified as Chandarbhan, a 35-year-old resident of Mongolpuri. “During preliminary investigation, it was revealed that he was last seen with two men on a motorcycle. Several people were questioned and CCTV footages were checked and finally our teams managed to identify the duo as Pradeep and Raju, both residents of the same area. But when they were detained for questioning along with other suspects, they refused any involvement,” said Singh.The DCP said the team was headed towards a dead-end as there were no eye witness to the crime. “Our teams rechecked the inputs and sequence of crime and when it was established that these two were definitely involved in the crime, they were told that the area in which Chandrabhan was killed is under continuous surveillance of NASA’s satellite cameras and that their entire act has been recorded,” said Singh.Thinking their act has been caught, the two allegedly confessed to having committed the murder. “It seems Chandrabhan used to often abuse them whenever he consumed alcohol. To teach him a lesson, on April 4, they took Chandrabhan to the park on the pretext of consuming alcohol. Once he was inebriated, they warned him to never abuse them again. This led to a fight during which the duo used stones and bludgeoned him to death,” the DCP said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/police-crack-35-year-old-s-murder-with-help-from-a-non-existent-nasasatellite-101618172528254.html
12-04-2021||Delhi||In a first, seven group housing plots for sale||Two years after it approved a policy allowing private players to develop housing projects to meet the growing housing needs of the city, the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) put on sale seven group housing plots for the first time on Sunday. The seven plots — in areas such as Rohini, Dwarka and Narela, among others — each measure over 5,000sqm.Till now, these plots were allotted only to registered Cooperative Group Housing Societies (CGHS), said a DDA official.“A private developer or a registered society can bid for these plots. One of the important conditions in this is that the developer entity will have to provide for 15% housing for the economically weaker section,” said a senior DDA official.Apart from CGHS plots, DDA has also put on sale 76 institutional plots, 27 industrial plots, 36 residential plots, 125 shops in its district/community/local shopping centres, six restaurant units and 33 commercial plots.In January 2020, the DDA had put these plots up for auction but had to withdraw it as it required a change in its Act. The amendment was cleared this year.Mudassir Zaidi, executive director, Knight Frank, welcomed the move and said there is demand for affordable housing in the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/in-a-first-seven-group-housing-plots-for-sale-101618172667307.html

Vaccination at several workplaces in the city also started today (Sunday) as part of the Tika Utsav.”Apart from the temporary vaccine camps, jabs were also administered to eligible beneficiaries in the 739 vaccine centres across the city. The drive is currently open for all people aged 45 years and above.

12-04-2021||Delhi||AAP MLA Raghav Chadha asks PM Modi to open up Covid-19 shots||Pushing for a strict “India-first” rule for Covid-19 vaccination, AAP MLA and party spokesperson Raghav Chadha on Sunday said he has written a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, seeking priority for citizens’ needs over exports to other countries. The Delhi BJP, however, accused the AAP of trying to mislead the people.In his letter, Chadha, stressing on the need for “vaccine nationalism”, said the Centre has chosen to export over 64 million doses to 84 countries “while Indian citizens are desperately looking for a vaccination centre that is still open”.“I wish to ask the government of India as to whether its priority is the people of Delhi or of Dominican Republic? The people of Maharashtra or of Mauritius? The people of Bengal or Bangladesh? Gujarat or Guyana? Odisha or Oman? Uttar Pradesh or the United Kingdom? Kerala or Kenya,” Chadha asked.He urged the government to prioritise vaccinating the population of India before “earning trivial international laurels”.“Don’t let vaccination centres shut while doses are being flown out of the country…,” he said.“Vaccines should have a strict India-first rule, with Indian citizens’ needs being given priority over exports to other countries,” Chadha said.The letter comes amid reports of vaccine shortage by several states in the country, claims which the Centre have repeatedly rejected.Last week, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had written to Modi, urging him to open the vaccination drive for everyone in light of the severe spike in Covid-19 cases across the country.Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said, “Chadha’s letter is neither motivated by any form of nationalism nor any concern for the youth of the country. AAP is simply trying to mislead people on the issue. The government of India is seriously committed to speedy vaccination of all. The government has organised the biggest vaccine drive in the country from April 11 to 14.”The Prime Minister’s Office did not immediately comment on the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/aap-mla-raghav-chadha-asks-pm-to-open-up-shots-101618167520237.html
12-04-2021||Delhi||Despite Covid-19 surge in Delhi, caution not in the picture||On Sunday, when the national capital reported 10,774 fresh Covid-19 cases at a positivity rate of 9.43%, some popular hangout places and tourist spots were teeming with crowds, with physical distancing norms going for a toss. While the footfall at some of the places has reduced compared to last month, distancing and poor mask discipline continued be a concern.HT visited India Gate, Humayun’s Tomb, Delhi zoo and the Central Park at Connaught Place on Sunday and saw poor compliance with social distancing protocols at some places and poor mask hygiene at all the spots.Read more: Delhi's situation worrying, 4th wave dangerous, says KejriwalDelhi zooOutside the Delhi zoo, people were seen sitting together in groups either without wearing a mask or wearing them below the nose or on the chin. Shabnam, a visitor, said she had stepped out after nearly a year to visit the zoo along with relatives. She said that while the crowd wasn’t much, people were not wearing the mask properly. “Many people are not wearing the mask or wearing it on their chins. We tried to maintain a distance from such people but the government should also keep an eye out and make announcements.”Ramesh Kumar Pandey, director, Delhi zoo, said they were ensuring compliance with Covid-19 protocols. “The footfall is less, due to which distancing concerns are addressed. Our staff keep reminding people to wear a mask,” said Pandey.Central Park, CPThe Central Park at Connaught Place was packed with people, who openly flouted distancing norms. Many there were seen without a mask as they hung around the fountain at the park.Atul Bhargava, president of the New Delhi Traders’ Association, said the government was enforcing the rules properly. He said while the association had put up posters, it was difficult to monitor hawkers and other visitors at Central Park. “The government should shut the park for one month. People go there in large numbers and don’t wear masks. Unfortunately, there is no enforcement and support from either the central or the Delhi government,” alleged Bhargav.Read more: Fear of 2020 rerun grips Delhi's migrants amid Covid-19 infection spikeHumayun’s TombAt ASI-protected Humayun’s Tomb, lack of social distancing was spotted near the manual ticket counter. Inside the monument, mask hygiene was poor with people giving up on masks all together as they got busy clicking pictures.An ASI officer, who didn’t wish to be identified, said: “The security staff has been instructed to ensure that people do not crowd and follow Covid-19 protocols at all times. We have instructed them to sensitise people about the rules in places. However, we can’t chase them, if they do not wear a mask,” said the official.India GateAmong all the places that HT visited on Sunday, enforcement of rules was the harshest at India Gate. While some people were seen not wearing masks, civil defence volunteers kept a close eye on violators.Read more: Sweeping curbs announced in Delhi as Covid-19 cases shootRamesh Kumar, a street food vendor, alleged that police and volunteers were arbitrarily penalising people. “The crowd is less since last Tuesday. Most people are wearing masks but volunteers still keep shouting at us. Our earnings have exhausted due to so many curbs,” said Kumar, who hails from Badayun in Uttar Pradesh.Delhi police spokesperson Chinmoy Biswal said police teams are imposing fines on people who are caught not wearing masks, spitting in public, or not following social distancing at all public places across Delhi daily. “In crowded areas like monuments, tourist places, and parks, people tend to not observe social distancing strictly when they are wearing masks. Our teams intervene and make sure all government guidelines are followed,” the officer said.Biswal said regular announcements are also made to make people aware of the norms. “In market areas, CCTV cameras are being used and wherever it is seen social distancing is not being followed, our teams are rushed to intervene,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/despite-covid-19-surge-in-delhi-caution-not-in-the-picture-101618167593888.html
12-04-2021||Delhi||Delhi's daily Covid-19 cases breach 10,000 mark||Delhi on Sunday reported 10,774 fresh Covid-19 cases, the highest single-day tally of infections in the national capital since the pandemic began raging across countries last year, as the outbreak expanded its footprint in the fourth wave at rates not seen during the previous three peaks in the city.Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said the situation in Delhi was “very serious”, issuing a warning to people to not step out of their homes unless it was urgent.Sunday’s tally eclipsed the previous record of 8,593 new infections in a day recorded on November 11. The Capital also added 48 deaths of the infection on Sunday, the most fatalities in a day since December 14, when the city logged 60 deaths. The spike was also the highest jump in two consecutive daily tallies, with Delhi adding 2,877 more new cases compared to Saturday, when the Capital recorded 7,897 new infections.Read more: Lockdown no option, step out of home only if necessary: Kejriwal“Cases have escalated in a big way in the last 10-15 days… The situation is very serious,” Kejriwal said in a digital news briefing.For the week ending April 11, Delhi added an average of 6,963 fresh infections every day. Just a week ago, the seven-day average of cases was 2,671. This means that daily infections have leapt 161% in a week. As HT reported on April 9, this is a week-on-week rate of increase not seen at any point in the Capital even during the third wave of infections.Delhi’s fourth wave of infections comes amid a second nationwide surge, which has surpassed the previous peaks recorded at the national level as well as in individual states, HT’s Covid-19 dashboard shows. Experts have attributed the rise in infections in the Capital to poor adherence to Covid-appropriate behaviour such as masking and social distancing, and to potential impacts of the mutant variants of the coronavirus.Read more: Delhi imposes new Covid-19 curbs. What allowed, what's notDr Jacob John, former head of the clinical virology department at Christian Medical College in Tamil Nadu’s Vellore, said, “Mutant variants are definitely one of the main factors behind the current surge across India. We need more recent state-wise data on genome sequencing results to understand the role of mutant variants and thorough analysis. India anyway started focusing very late on mutant strains. We should not waste more time.”The surge has forced the Delhi government to reintroduce curbs on schools, transport and gatherings, even as the Capital put in place a night curfew between 10pm and 5am to control the spread of the infection.On Saturday, the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) brought back sweeping restrictions on activities to curb the alarming spread of Covid-19, banning large public gatherings, curtailing crowds in wedding and funerals, and capping maximum capacity for restaurants, cinema halls and public buses among other things.Read more: Fear of 2020 rerun grips Delhi's migrants amid Covid-19 infection spikeKejriwal expressed concern at the ongoing current surge. While he ruled out a lockdown in the Capital, he warned that if the city’s health care infrastructure was overwhelmed, it may force the state government’s hand.“I believe that lockdown is no solution to the pandemic. We have seen that once. It is only for times when a state’s health system collapses. If we have your support and the health care management system is under control, then there will be no need for a lockdown. But if it goes out of control, we may be forced to impose a lockdown,” the chief minister said.The Capital has seen three distinct surges, or waves, of the viral infections. The first was between early May and early July, the second was in September, while the third was reported between the second week of October and November-end.During the first wave, the seven-day average of cases peaked at 3,446 and the week-on-week growth touched a high of 101%. In the second wave, which peaked at 4,174 cases in mid-September, the growth rate never went beyond 58%.Read more: Delhi's situation worrying, 4th wave dangerous, says KejriwalEven during the third wave, when the seven-day average of new cases soared to 7,341 in mid-November, the week-on-week growth rate remained under 40%.The test positivity rate, which is considered a crucial metric to gauge the spread of an infection in a region, has also shot up sharply over the past few weeks. The city reported a positivity rate of 9.43%, showed the Delhi government’s daily health bulletin on Sunday. A week ago, this number was at 4.64%, while two weeks ago, the rate was 2.35%.To be sure, Delhi also conducted the most tests in a single day on Sunday, collecting 114,288 samples to check for the infection, greater than the previous high of 109,398, recorded on Friday. Most of the tests on Sunday — 67% — were conducted using the more reliable reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) technique.Dr Lalit Kant, former head of the division of epidemiology and communicable diseases at the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), said, “People have let their guards down in terms of adherence to Covid-appropriate behaviour, and this is visible everywhere around us now. This has contributed to the ongoing surge majorly. While the government has to scale up its testing, tracing, containment and vaccination strategies to arrest the spread of the disease at the earliest, people will have to adhere to the regulations that are in force in Delhi.”After the third wave, the case trajectory and deaths dropped sharply to lows not seen since the early months of the breakout of the coronavirus disease, and the pandemic seemed to decline.Read more: 20-30% people lose natural immunity against Covid in 6 months, new study findsThe fifth serological survey conducted between January 15 and 23 revealed that 56% of samples collected during the study had antibodies against the Sars-Cov-2 virus, which causes the coronavirus disease.Delhi’s test positivity rate fell to an all-time low of 0.17% on February 16, as the infections reported a lull in the city. On that day, cases too, fell to a 292-day low of 94.Dr Kant said, “Mass vaccination looks like the only way to achieve herd immunity now. It is clear that natural antibodies do not last long. Delhi recorded a sero prevalence of 56% in February but still the virus is raging in the Capital now. Also, sero-surveys only told us about detection of antibodies among individuals, but not about the quality and quantity of the antibodies detected in those individuals. These are areas in which we still need more data to understand the disease, its trends and to control its spread more effectively.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhis-daily-cases-breach-10-000-mark-101618166353866.html
12-04-2021||Delhi||Lockdown no option, step out of home only if necessary: Kejriwal||On a day when Delhi reported its highest ever tally of Covid-19 cases in a day, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday said that though a lockdown was no solution to the pandemic but the city government could be forced to impose full restrictions if the health care system collapsed, while urging citizens to stay indoors and step out of their homes only if “very necessary”.“In Delhi, we have fought three waves. The fourth wave is dangerous. It is spreading fast. Around mid-March, Delhi was witnessing less than 200 cases a day. On Sunday, it recorded 10,732 cases in the previous 24 hours [This was updated to 10,774 cases in the health bulletin issued later in the day]. On Saturday, Delhi recorded 7,897 new cases and on Friday 8,521 new cases. It shows how fast the disease is spreading now. The situation is concerning and we are closely monitoring it,” said Kejriwal.Sunday’s case tally was the highest in the city so far. The previous record was 8,593 cases on November 11.Citing the government data to say that 65% of the patients who are now getting the infection in Delhi are less than 45 years old, Kejriwal urged the central government to open the ongoing vaccination drive to people of all ages and relax the protocol for starting new vaccine sites. The vaccination drive is currently open for people aged over 45 years across the country.Reaching out to those who have tested positive so far, the Delhi chief minister said those with mild or no symptoms should not rush to hospitals and leave beds vacant for patients with severe symptoms. According to the Sunday bulletin, 5,459 Covid beds were vacant in the city hospitals, while 17,093 people were under home isolation.3-step plan to curb casesSpelling out his government’s strategy to curb the sharp spike in infections, the chief minister said his government was working on three fronts — enforcing Covid-19 discipline, ramping up health infrastructure and speeding up vaccinations.“We are working largely on three fronts. First, we aim to arrest the spread of the disease. This is a front on which the government alone can’t do much. We need immense cooperation from the people of Delhi. I request people to always wear a mask, maintain social distancing, wash hands, and stay indoors. Step out only if necessary. We do not want to impose a lockdown but some restrictions had to be imposed yesterday (Saturday) in light of the severe spike in cases. Please let us try not to get that more severe.”“Second, we aim to ensure the best health care service – hospital beds, ICU, ventilators… Hospital management is our priority. We urge people to use the mobile app launched by the government to check the availability of beds. Also, please do not hesitate to go to government hospitals. The government hospitals in Delhi are good. We assure you of quality health care there,” he said.“Third, we are aiming at speeding up the vaccination process. I have written to the central government to remove all restrictions concerning vaccination. Now, 65% of patients are less than 45 years old, our records showed. How do we stop the spread without vaccinating this age group? We need to remove all restrictions and take up vaccination on a war footing.,” he said.Don’t rush to hospitalsHe added that only those with severe symptoms should go to hospitals, urging others to recuperate under home isolation under which the government provides free pulse oximeters and regular follow-up calls and advice by doctors. “If everyone rushes to hospitals, we will run out of beds, ICUs, ventilators, etc. An asymptomatic person going to a hospital can deprive a serious patient of a bed, that can eventually lead to that patient’s death. We have an excellent home-isolation model. That is more than capable of taking care of patients with mild or no symptoms. Please keep hospital beds vacant for serious patients.”On Saturday, the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) brought back sweeping restrictions on activities to curb the alarming spread of Covid-19, banning large public gatherings, curtailing crowds in wedding and funerals, and capping maximum capacity for restaurants, cinema halls and public buses among other things.No lockdown, for nowAllaying fears of a complete lockdown, the chief minister said such restrictions will be considered only in case the health system collapses.“I believe that the lockdown is no solution to the pandemic. We have seen that once. It is only meant for times when a state’s health system collapses. It helps to slow down the rate of transmission, giving governments more time to prepare. If we have your support and the health care management system is under control, then there will be no need for a lockdown. But, if it goes out of control, we may be forced to put in place a lockdown, even though we don’t want to impose one.”Don’t hesitate to get jabKejriwal also urged people to not hesitate from taking the vaccine amid reports that doctors who were reportedly vaccinated against the disease have tested positive. “We have come across reports from several states about doctors testing Covid-19 positive despite taking both doses of the vaccine. I consulted doctors and experts and learnt that vaccines do not give protection from potential infection. It protects from severe effects of Covid-19. So, I urge all eligible beneficiaries to not hesitate from taking the vaccine and add that additional shield of protection. But one has to continue wearing masks and following all regulations,” he said.Kejriwal called upon all political parties to join hands in controlling the pandemic. He said: “We have scaled up tests – 120,000 per day. I appeal to all political parties to join hands in the fight against Covid-19. This is not the time for politics. Let us fight Covid-19 together. I have also come across people who say that they are tired of wearing masks. I want to ask them: Are the doctors and paramedics not tired? They work in PPE kits all day. Letting our guard down is not allowed at this stage.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/lockdown-no-option-step-out-of-home-only-if-necessary-kejriwal-101618166540908.html

SFI-AUD convenor Priyansh Maurya was later suspended by the varsity administration for drawing graffiti on the campus walls.Maurya, a history student, said he was shocked to receive the order. “..Making graffiti on the campus wall has been a culture of AUD…I completely deny that I drew the graffiti out of uncontrollable anger, for which the administration is referring me to the Ehsaas Clinic for anger management,” he said.In its order, the university administration said the proctorial committee constituted to conduct an inquiry in the matter submitted its report and said Maurya “is required to pay a fine of ₹39,442 towards the cost of damage of the university property.” The administration has barred Maurya from the campus till he pays the fine, and also scrapped his registration for the winter semester.“Maurya is advised to seek counselling at AUD Ehsaas Clinic for his anger management and submit a report verified by the centre of psychotherapy and clinical research school of human studies for the session attended by him before joining the 2021 monsoon semester,” the university said in its notice. They have also asked for an “apology letter through his parents.”While the university administration claimed Maurya admitted that his actions were due to a “bout of uncontrollable anger”, the student denied it.Elizabeth Alexander, another student of the varsity and an SFI member, said the order would require Maurya to repeat an entire year.The university’s public relations officer said, “He has been found to have defaced the property of the university in the past as well. As his acts were in clear violation of the AUD’s code of discipline for students, he has been fined ₹40,000 which is commensurate with the 50% cost of repairing the defaced property.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/aud-student-fined-rs-40k-for-defacing-wall-told-to-attend-anger-mgmt-classes-101618163820609.html
12-04-2021||Chandigarh||Centre flags worsening Covid situation in 8 Punjab districts||The Union health ministry has expressed serious concern over a worsening Covid-19 situation in eight Punjab districts on the basis of reports of its teams stationed in the state and suggested measures to curb the virus spread. In a letter to Punjab principal secretary (health) Hussan Lal, Union health secretary Rajesh Bhusan on Saturday said the state government should take necessary action to tackle the rising number of cases in Amritsar, Hoshiarpur, Jalandhar, Ludhiana, Patiala, Rupnagar, Mohali and Shaheed Bhagat Singh Nagar districts. These are among the 50 worst-affected districts in the country, of which 30 are in Maharashtra and 11 in Chhattisgarh. The Union health secretary said the situation in four Punjab districts — Mohali, Ludhiana, Patiala and Rupnagar — was even more worrying. He also underlined that the central teams have also reported lack of Covid-19 appropriate behaviour by the community and suggested stricter ground-level enforcement by the district authorities. The central teams have been tasked to work along with district health authorities on pandemic preparedness and response with focus on testing, contact tracing and containment operations, Covid-19 appropriate behaviour and its enforcement, hospital infrastructure and availability of logistics and vaccination progress.There is a need to enhance focus on contact tracing in Patiala and Ludhiana while contact tracing and surveillance in Mohali were hampered due to shortage of manpower, the letter read. Low pace of testing was reported from Patiala, the home district of Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh, it was said. The Union health secretary said there is no RT-PCR testing laboratory in Rupnagar district and the issue be addressed urgently. “There is no dedicated Covid-19 hospital in Mohali and Rupnagar districts, and patients are being referred to neighboring districts or Chandigarh. Hospital bed occupancy rates in Mohali, Jalandhar, and Ludhiana are on the higher side and suitable arrangements be made with sufficient lead time to prepare for any surge in cases,” he added. The teams also reported issues regarding procurement of ventilators for proper case management in Shaheed Bhagat Singh Nagar district, he pointed out. “Though ventilators are available in Rupnagar district, these are not being optimally utilised due to shortage of healthcare workers, particularly doctors and nurses. Contractual hiring of health care workers would go a long way in addressing this,” he claimed. The central teams also reported shortage of staff in Patiala and Mohali. In Patiala and Ludhiana, a slow pace of vaccination was reported among those aged above 45 and with co-morbidities.On Saturday, the Punjab CM had urged the Centre to share the schedule for supply of vaccines with the states over the next quarter based on confirmed orders as Punjab is left with only 5 days of supply. “As many as 98% beds with oxygen support were occupied in Hoshiarpur, the highest among the 8 districts, followed by Mohali at 69%. Also, 89% of ICU beds are occupied in Ludhiana, followed by Mohali (80%) and SBS Nagar (70.6 %). Jalandhar has the highest number of 139 dedicated ambulances for Covid management, followed by Patiala at 57,” the letter further reads.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/centre-flags-worsening-covid-situation-in-8-punjab-districts-101618173213581.html
12-04-2021||Chandigarh||Adesh Partap Kairon aides holding meets in Khemkaran despite Virsa Singh Valtoha declared SAD candidate||Former cabinet minister and Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) leader Adesh Partap Singh Kairon’s supporters continue to hold meetings in the Khemkaran constituency even as party president Sukhbir Singh Badal had announced the candidature of ex-legislator Virsa Singh Valtoha from the seat last month. Kairon’s close aide Gurmukh Singh Ghulla, who has been holding meetings in villages, claims that the SAD leader’s wife and former chief minister Parkash Singh Badal’s daughter Parneet Kaur Kairon will contest on party ticket from the segment which is the home turf of Valtoha. On Saturday and Sunday, Ghulla visited the constituency’s Valtoha, Bhaini Massa Singh and Rasulpur villages. “Adesh Partap Singh Kairon will resume holding public meetings in the constituency in the days to come. Whatever Kairon has said is his final decision. Come what may, Parneet Kaur will fight the election on party symbol from the seat,” Ghulla told HT over phone.Last month, Kairon, a former MLA from the Patti constituency, held public meetings in Khemkaran villages for two days, saying one of his family members will contest from the segment. But at a party rally at Amarkot village on March 15, Sukhbir snubbed Kairon by announcing Valtoha as party candidate from seat for the 2022 assembly elections.Without naming Kairon, Sukhbir said Akali leaders should stay away from “factionalism” and work for strengthening the party. Valtoha, who has been contesting on party ticket from the constituency since 2007, said the Kairon family was trying to benefit the Congress. “The Kairons have no right to stake claim for the ticket. They should focus on the Patti segment which they have abandoned for the last 4 years. The SAD workers in Patti are feeling dejected,” he said. “The Akali Dal decided to field me from Khemkaran after consultations with party patron Parkash Singh Badal.

Reacting to the alleged abduction and torture of a cousin of gangster-turned-activist Lakha Sidhana, who is wanted in the January 26 Red Fort violence case, the cricketer-turned-politician posted on Twitter, said, “Lessons should be learnt from West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee who put the CBI behind the bars when they encroached upon her state’s jurisdiction. It violates the Punjab government’s authority. With whose connivance was it done?” Though he did not mention the name of Sidhana or his cousin, his tweet was seen as an indirect attack on his own party’s government.Sukhbir holds Amarinder responsible Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Singh Badal on Sunday condemned the alleged abduction and torture of a cousin of gangster-turned-activist Lakha Sidhana by the Delhi Police. In a press statement, the SAD leader held Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh responsible for the “atrocities being inflicted on the youth” who had participated in the farmers’ protests. “We want to ask Capt Amarinder why he is allowing the Delhi Police to indulge in such acts. The Delhi cops do not have any jurisdiction in Punjab but Amarinder Singh is allowing them a free hand to conduct raids in the state and arrest youth on flimsy charges. It should be stopped,” he said. “We want you to stand up to protect the rights of the people of Punjab and register a criminal case against the Delhi Police team which abducted and tortured the youth.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/shameful-to-allow-delhi-cops-to-torture-people-in-punjab-sidhu-on-abduction-of-sidhana-cousin-101618172976037.html

Gurdeep Singh (24) along with his friend Gurpreet Singh was allegedly picked by unidentified persons stated to be Delhi cops from near Punjabi University, Patiala, on April 8 evening supposedly to extract information about Sidhana’s whereabouts. They were dropped at Ambala around noon the next day, it was claimed. The Bathinda police on Sunday registered a daily diary report (DDR) in the alleged incident. Bathinda senior superintendent of police (SSP) BS Virk said since the alleged crime took place in Patiala, they have intimated their counterparts for further investigation. “A communiqué was sent today on the basis of a statement of Gurdeep Singh. Technically, the alleged incident took place in Patiala, but we are also probing the matter as the patient who is undergoing treatment at the Bathinda civil hospital,” said the SSP. Gurdeep, a law student, went to Patiala from Bathinda’s Sidhana village on April 8 to appear in examination through online mode, it was claimed. On Saturday night, Sidhana and his supporters reached the hospital. “Gurdeep was subjected to severe torture. The Punjab government should intervene against the illegal action of the Delhi Police. The Centre is resorting to such actions to intimidate those spearheading the farmers’ agitation against the three farm laws,” Sidhana said. Dr Ravinder Singh Ahluwalia, who attended to Gurdeep at the emergency ward, said the patient had blunt injuries and he was out of danger since his admission. It is learnt that there are gaps in Gurdeep’s statement and the police have been asked to look into the same. As per the statement, Gurdeep and his friend were on a motorbike when they were forcibly taken in an SUV. Gurdeep told the police that abductors introduced themselves as Delhi cops who had arrested Punjabi actor Deep Sidhu in the Delhi violence case. Gurpreet was not touched by the alleged abductors, it was claimed. “Why no police complaint was lodged by anyone when he went missing is intriguing. We don’t know why the victim or his family waited for over two days till Saturday night to report the matter. Also, why did Gurdeep travel all the way to Patiala from his village just to appear in online examination,” said a police official. He said the mobile phones of both Gurdeep and Gurpreet will be analysed to gather forensic clues as where they were taken after the alleged abduction. Gurpreet will also be questioned for more details. The police denied that the victim’s family had shared any input of having CCTV footage of the abduction with them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/gangsterturnedactivist-sidhana-s-cousin-alleges-abduction-torture-by-delhi-cops-ddr-lodged-101618172974529.html

The agitating farmers also tried to jump the barricades. Police personnel deployed at the spot were seen struggling to contain the crowd but no incidents of violence were reported. BKU (Charuni)’s Kaithal unit president Hoshiar Singh Gill said the farmers will continue to protest against the BJP-JJP leaders till the three “anti-farmer” laws are repealed. Gill also accused the BJP-led state government of trying to divide people on the basis of religion and caste by organising programmes “on the pretext of honouring great personalities like Bhim Rao Ambedkar”.Reacting to the incident, Dhankar said the government has already agreed to make amendments in the three laws, and holding such protests is wrong and will lead to losses for farmers in the long run. “The new laws are not going to have any impact on the minimum support price (MSP) or mandi system. It is wrong to start agitations on flimsy predictions,” he added.The former agriculture minister of Haryana further said the farmers should protest against the Capt Amarinder Singh-led Congress government in Punjab for not purchasing sugarcane at rates par with Haryana. He also asked the Capt government to procure bajra and mustard on MSP like Haryana.Earlier during an interaction with mediapersons, Dhankar was quizzed about the registration of FIRs against journalists. He replied, “There may be some differences with cops but the courts are open and anybody can go there to get justice.”The minister was joined by minister of state for women and child development minister Kamlesh Dhanda and Kurukshetra MP Nayab Saini at the event.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/now-dhankar-faces-black-flags-at-kaithal-event-101618172493535.html

Different trial courts convicted eight accused in January, 18 in February and 12 accused were brought to justice and sentenced to rigorous imprisonment, ranging from five years to life term in March this year. The court had also imposed a fine, ranging between ₹7,500 and ₹55,000, on the convicted persons, a police spokesperson said. In January, one convict was awarded life term, two others were sentenced to 20 years in prison, while four were awarded 10-year jail term and one convict was sent to seven years in jail. During the hearing of cases in February, the trial courts convicted five accused after holding them guilty of rape and molestation and sentenced them to imprisonment ranging from five years to 20 years. One accused was awarded five years’ jail in a kidnapping case and 12 were sentenced to life imprisonment while holding them guilty in murder and dacoity cases, the police said. Police attributed the impressive conviction rate to effective monitoring of cases and evidence gathering by cops investigating such cases. “Police have not only been arresting the accused immediately after the crime is reported, but also ensuring that all such accused are brought to justice through effective presentation of evidence before the courts concerned,” a police spokesperson said. Director general of police (DGP) Manoj Yadava has been monitoring the functioning of field staff to ensure ‘effective pairvi’ of cases and conviction of the accused. The establishment of fast-track courts is also proving helpful in this direction, the police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/in-3-months-38-convicted-for-heinous-crimes-in-haryana-101618171839449.html

The situation is very tense. Violence by the mob continued for quite some time and we are trying to control the situation,” Baran superintendent of police Vineet Bansal said, adding that both mobile and broadband internet have been suspended in the area till April 13.

The room has been set up near the Saral Suvidha Kendra to make it accessible for women who come to avail the various citizen-centric services provided here. The idea of setting up a breastfeeding room was mooted by the staff of the district women and child welfare department. They took up the matter with deputy commissioner (DC) Dharmendra Singh, who readily gave his assent. Ritu Rani, district programme assistant of Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana, said, “Earlier, women who wanted privacy while feeding their infants had to do so in the washrooms. This is neither convenient nor hygienic. The breastfeeding room will provide new mothers a clean, safe and private space to feed their babies.” DC Dharmendra Singh said breastfeeding rooms are aimed at making public spaces more accessible to women, especially those who have young children. “Gender parity cannot be achieved unless we make public spaces, including workplaces, safe and convenient for women.” Seema Rani, a migrant labourer who had come to the Saral Kendra with her six-month-old daughter, said, “This is a good initiative by the administration. We cannot leave our children at home. We should be provided a private space for breastfeeding the infants.” While women visiting the mini-secretariat said that similar rooms should be set up at other public spaces, such as railway stations, bus stands and women police stations as well, the Panipat DC said the administration is also exploring the possibility of starting a creche service for employees of the secretariat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/breastfeeding-room-at-panipat-mini-secretariat-a-big-help-for-nursing-mothers-101618171353427.html

His family has alleged torture at the hands of the jail staff whereas the prison authorities said 35-year-old Mani complained of stomach ache and he died on way to the civil hospital.Mani’s wife Prabhjit Kaur said her husband spoke to her over the phone around 10.30 pm on Saturday and was sounding good. She said the family was informed in the morning that Mani had died. She alleged that her husband was tortured in the jail at the behest of the ASI whose son was killed in the 2016 incident. She also claimed having transferred ₹35,000 in an account on Saturday as demanded by her husband.“We were not allowed to meet him in the jail but we were in touch on phone,” she said, adding: “He often told us that he was tortured. Even for routine medicine, money was demanded from him. We suspect that the bank account in which he made us transfer the money belonged to a cop.”Jail superintendent Iqbal Singh Dhaliwal refuted the allegations saying a magisterial inquiry will bring out the truth. “The inmate complained of stomach ache between 6 and 6.15am. He was attended by the jail doctor but as he started swooning, he was taken to the civil hospital in an ambulance where he was declared brought dead,” Dhaliwal said.He revealed Mani was lodged in the jail since 2019 when he was convicted for life for the murder ASI’s son 20-year-old Layakdeep Singh, who was shot dead in Amritsar on May 21, 2016. Several criminal cases were pending against Mani, Dhaliwal said. “As he was a high-risk prisoner, he was lodged in a separate cell in the high-security zone. Except for the duty staff, no one was allowed to enter in that cell,” he added.As for the use of cellphone by the gangster, the superintendent said it would have to be probed. “There is very little possibility as we conduct frequent searches, but we will inquire if Mani had access to one,” he said.After the post-mortem was conducted in the presence of a judicial magistrate, Mani’s relatives, accompanied by some local men, staged a protest outside the hospital mortuary and demanded a high-level inquiry into the “suspicious” death.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/gangster-serving-life-term-dies-mysteriously-in-hoshiarpur-jail-101618170334387.html

The two were arrested by Dindoshi police on Saturday before they could sell any of the cylinders. The police recovered over 40 Hindustan Petroleum cylinders worth ₹3.5 lakh from the duo. According to police officers, the two accused – Bhagirathi Sona Ramesh Udhni, 25, and Jagdish Sarne, 38 – used to work at a gas agency. However, during the lockdown last year, the duo lost their jobs. The two had, however, maintained their consumer list. Senior inspector Dhamendra Kimble of Dindoshi police station said that on Saturday the two stole a tempo from Gargi gas agency in Goregaon (East). Kamble said that when the gas agency owner complained to them, they traced the accused through the tempo they had stolen. The two confessed to the crime and said that they were anticipating a total lockdown from next week and wanted to sell the stolen cylinders at ₹3,000- ₹4,000 each. The officers investigating the case said that when the accused worked for at the gas agency, they used to take out at least 1-2kg from each cylinder and fill another empty cylinder with it. They used to then sell that cylinder at inflated prices illegally to shops and establishments without proper licences, and put lives at risk. “We have arrested the two for robbery, dealing in combustible material and committing offence with common intent and cheating,” said Kamble.

12-04-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: No green assessment for Metro Bhavan; experts seek scrutiny||Despite being located within an eco-sensitive zone (ESZ), the Metro Bhavan high-rise in Aarey Colony proposed by the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) will not be subject to an environment impact assessment (EIA) or public hearing as part of the regulatory process for obtaining environmental clearance (EC), show public documents reviewed by Hindustan Times.The pro forma documents, submitted to the state environment department by MMRDA while seeking EC for the proposed 32-storey skyscraper, also show that the project is being appraised by a state-level authority. Experts and environmentalists alleged this to be in variance with the law which mandates that the project be referred to the Union environment ministry for clearance.“The purpose of demarcating an ESZ is to reduce anthropogenic stress on a protected area. The Metro Bhavan does exactly the opposite. Prima facie, it seems that the project proponent is evading the appropriate level of scrutiny. If sent to the ministry, it will rightly be considered a Category-A project, and impact assessment and public hearing will become mandatory. This could create a hurdle for the MMRDA,” said D Stalin, environmentalist and director, Vanashakti NGO. Stalin has filed three petitions relating to the Aarey dispute in the Supreme Court.ECO-SENSITIVE ZONEThe proposed location of Metro Bhavan (Survey No. 598A, Goregaon East) lies inside a delineated eco-sensitive buffer zone around Sanjay Gandhi National Park (SGNP), which was notified by the ministry of environment, forests and climate change (MoEFCC) in December 2016.“The ecological risks of any project in this area also have to be appraised by the ministry, not the state government,” Stalin added.At the time, MoEFCC had also constituted a monitoring committee to implement and oversee the rules prescribed in the ESZ notification. The committee’s tasks include making recommendations on proposed changes in land use, regulating vehicular movement within the ESZ, reporting violations to the ministry, among others.The ministry, in December 2016, had stated that any permissible activities under the Environment Impact Assessment Notification (2006), if proposed within the buffer zone of SGNP, “shall be scrutinised by the monitoring committee based on the actual site-specific conditions and referred to the Central government... for prior environmental clearances under the provisions of the said notification.”“It is necessary to conserve and protect the area around the Sanjay Gandhi National Park as Eco-sensitive Zone from ecological and environmental point of view and to prohibit industries or class of industries... in the said ESZ,” states the ministry’s notification, a copy of which is available online.However, MMDRA referred their Metro Bhavan project — proposal SIA/MH/MIS/188820/2020 on PARIVESH, a single-window online portal for processing environmental and CRZ clearances — to the state environment department on December 17, 2020.Two regulatory bodies under the department — an expert appraisal committee (EAC) and an environment impact assessment authority — have since considered the proposal on February 17 and February 26 this year. HT had reported the development on March 7. Available minutes of their meetings do not reflect any instruction to refer the matter to the Centre.“This is a deviation from the law. MoEFCC’s guidelines are very clear on what the protocol is. The ministry should ask the environment department to explain why they are appraising a proposal which is evidently not in their jurisdiction,” said Debi Goenka, executive trustee, Conservation Action Trust.At least two senior officials in the MMRDA did not respond to a detailed request for comment. HT also contacted a deputy engineer with MMRDA, who is closely involved with the project, but they declined to speak.In a response to HT last month, MMRDA had said, “Metro Bhavan is a permissible activity as per MoEF notification of December 2016. Permission of monitoring committee is essential as the subject plot is under ESZ. Application for accord of permission of monitoring committee submitted.”Two monitoring committee members, including honorary wildlife warden Mayur Kamath and SGNP’s chief conservator of forests G Mallikarjuna, said they have not received such a proposal. When asked whether the Centre’s nod was mandatorily required for this project, committee members said they would follow the instructions of the ESZ notification when the matter comes to them.Manisha Mhaiskar, principal secretary, environment, in a text message to HT said, “As of now, we have deferred the matter for several compliances including land use. The matter will be heard on merits once all compliances are submitted.”ECOLOGICAL RISKSMMRDA officials also did not respond to queries anddeclined to comment on the ecological impact of the project.Experts, on the other hand, emphasised that Metro Bhavan will pose a major flood risk in the immediate vicinity. The earmarked two-hectare plot lies within the catchment of Oshiwara river and is riven by a perennial stream that carries storm-water out of Aarey Colony and into the river which flows onward to Malad Creek.“Besides being located in a known leopard habitat, the project site also has a tributary of the Oshiwara river. Concretising the area around it will worsen flooding downstream in Mumbai’s suburbs,” said Sanjiv Valsan, organiser with Save Aarey movement and a resident of the area.Aslam Saiyad, an environmentalist who has been documenting Mumbai’s rivers over last five years, added that concretising two hectares of forest land here may divert runoff onto the Western Express Highway in Goregaon, creating a major traffic bottleneck during heavy rains.In addition to waterlogging, experts also expressed concerns over the building’s proximity to SGNP, which lies 3kms east of the proposed project site. Public documents show that MMRDA also plans to build a helipad atop Metro Bhavan at a height of 156 metres, along with parking for 365 vehicles and a capacity to house around 8,000 people.“This level of human activity, especially development of aviation infrastructure, will put an incredible amount of pressure on the surrounding forest. Not to mention all the pollution that will be caused during the construction phase. Solid waste, sewage, construction dust and vehicular emissions in the area will go up exponentially. How can one allow this so close to a known wildlife habitat,” asked Stalin.ENVIRONMENT MANAGEMENT PLANAs per the documents reviewed by HT, MMRDA has categorised Metro Bhavan as a Category-B2 project under the EIA (2006), which means it will be cleared at the state-level and is also exempted from a public hearing and impact assessment.Category-A projects are those requiring clearance from the Centre following conditions, while Category-B1 projects are cleared at the state level after EIA compliances. B2 project are required to produce only an environment management plan (EMP) which is less intensive, logistically and financially.According to Zaman Ali — a lawyer who has litigated on several environmental matters before the Bombay high court and the western bench of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) — there is a specific condition under EIA 2006 which states that if any category-B project which falls within 5 kms of Protected Areas such as a national park or wildlife sanctuary, it mandatorily requires an appraisal by MoEFCC.“If this is allowed in this manner, the Metro Bhavan project will have a cascading effect on land use change in the area. Other builders will then apply for permission for more commercial projects in and around Aarey. The location is clearly avoidable since MMRDA has enough vacant plots in centrally located areas such as their home node BKC,” said Ali.Following rules for Category-B2 projects, MMRDA has allocated a capital expenditure of ₹351.5 lakh or 0.03% of the ₹972-crore budget toward EMP for Metro Bhavan.As per the MoEFCC’s EIA Notification, an EMP comprises “all mitigation measures... to be undertaken during the construction, operation and the entire life cycle to minimise adverse environmental impacts as a result of the activities of the project. It would also delineate the environmental monitoring plan for compliance of various environmental regulations. It will state the steps to be taken in case of emergency such as accidents at the site including fire.”Of the funds, ₹150 lakh will be spent on landscaping, ₹96 lakh on solar power infrastructure, ₹70 lakh on sewage treatment plants, ₹8 lakh on waste management and ₹7.5 lakh on rainwater harvesting equipment. In addition to this, MMRDA will incur an annual recurring cost of ₹39 lakh for operation and maintenance of this infrastructure.But, in another alleged deviation from protocol, MMRDA’s EMP does not include a detailed monitoring plan to ensure its own compliance. It does not prescribe any budget for “adverse environmental impacts” such as air pollution or human-animal conflict. Moreover, it does not allocate any fund toward regular environmental audits, as required under the EIA Notification.“Things like waste management, landscaping, rainwater harvesting... these are expected of any construction project today. So much so, they are built into the Bureau of Indian Standard’s National Building Code. It appears MMRDA has passed off routine expenses as part of its EMP,” said Stalin.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbaino-green-assessment-for-metro-bhavan-experts-seek-scrutiny-101618169792952.html
12-04-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Navy employee arrested for selling railway tickets illegally||Wadala Railway Police Force (RPF) arrested a tradesman mate of the Indian Navy on Saturday for booking e-tickets and tatkal tickets illegally for a commission of ₹200 each.According to officers of the anti-tout squad (ATS) of RPF, the accused has been identified as Parej Prabhakar Pimpol, 35. DH Patil, inspector, Wadala RPF, said ATS arrested Pimpol from GTB Nagar station when he was waiting for a railway clerk to hand over the tickets he had booked illegally. Pimpol was arrested with 13 e-tickets worth ₹35,693.Officials said that Pimpol had joined the Indian Navy in 2016 and was working as a tradesman mate. A few months later, the Railways had given a Passenger Reservation Centre at Navy Nagar to the Navy and asked their men to run it for Navy ticket bookings. A tradesman mate is usually employed to work in the production and maintenance section of the dock, ship or submarine. As Pimpol knew how to operate a computer, he was given training by a Railways clerk named Vinod Kumar for three days. After the training, Kumar allegedly told Pimpol to book tickets illegally for commuters who were ready to pay ₹200 for each tatkal ticket which Pimpol did from his personal mobile phone and user IDs.“On Saturday, when Pimpol went to GTB Nagar railway station to hand over the e-tickets to Kumar, he was caught by RPF ATS,” said Patil. On searching his bag, the police found a diary where Pimpol had written his user IDs and other details of passengers whose tickets he had booked through tatkal.The police are now in the process to question Kumar. They are also trying to find out whether more Navy personnel or tradesman mates are involved in illegal ticket booking.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-navy-employee-arrested-for-selling-railway-tickets-illegally-101618169733887.html
12-04-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab gets stock of 4 lakh doses, begins vaccination at workplaces||Punjab began vaccination for all those eligible in the current phase of the immunisation drive at their workplaces after receiving fresh stock of 4 lakh Covishield doses from the Centre on Sunday.To rapidly immunise eligible beneficiaries amid the second wave of infection, the health department launched over 100 mobile vans across all the districts, which will visit government and private workplaces with at least 50 eligible and interested beneficiaries. The Covid-19 vaccinations at private workplaces will be a paid service with the price capping of ₹250 per dose while sessions at government offices organised by district health authorities will be free of cost.“Most of the people above the age of 45 are working in the organised sector and they were facing roblems to take a day off from their work to get vaccinated. Also, many big industries, government offices and private firms have more than 100 employees who can be vaccinated easily under one roof. As the state began anti-covid vaccination at workplace in all the districts from Sunday, the workplace authorities and owners can now consult the officials of the district health department and demand a mobile van at their place,” said Dr Rajesh Bhaskar, state nodal officer for Covid-19.The workplace owners, both private and government, will have to submit names of at least 50 willing and eligible beneficiaries to call mobile vans at their workplaces. Any eligible employee of that workplace, even if not included in the list of 50, can avail the facility from the mobile van at his workplace. The management of the office, however, will be responsible for arranging rooms and space for inoculation.Dr Bhaskar added, “Besides workplace, people can also call vaccination mobile vans at their residential areas if there is the required number of willing beneficiaries. In that case, a vaccination camp will be set up at a particular place in that residential area and eligible beneficiaries will be allowed to take the jab. This initiative will help shun hesitancy as people will not have to visit faraway vaccination centres or hospitals and will not need to stand in long queues.”Amritsar, Ludhiana and Jalandhar districts have already started vaccinating people at their workplaces earlier this month, according to the health department.“As the state has received fresh stock of 4 lakh doses, we can expand our vaccination drive and can achieve our target of vaccinating maximum people,” Dr Bhaskar said, adding that the state has ordered more 10 lakh doses of the vaccine from the Centre, which are expected to arrive soon.66,585 get jabs on Day 1 of ‘Tika Utsav’The state health department administered the first dose of vaccine to 66,585 eligible beneficiaries on Sunday, the first day of the nationwide “Tika Utsav”. Also, 2,544 people were administered a second dose of their vaccine cycle on Sunday. Till now, the state has inoculated 16.91 lakh people of which 1.5 lakh have completed their vaccination process after taking second dose. “We are aiming to inoculate over 2 lakh people daily. Tika Utsav and vaccination at workplaces will help us to achieve our target,” Dr Bhaskar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-gets-stock-of-4-lakh-doses-begins-vaccination-at-workplaces-101618169733427.html
12-04-2021||Mumbai||Personal Finance: First-time home buyers||Home loan rates are at an all-time low, thus, prompting many people to invest in their choice of properties. The sops included in the Union Budget 2019 for first-time home buyers include a host of tax benefits, under Section 80C, Section 24 and Section 80EEA of the Income Tax Act 1961. This adds up to ₹5 lakh of tax benefits every year as opposed to the misconception that tax benefits do not exceed ₹1.5 lakh. Here’s what each section offers. Section 80C: This is one of the most popular and sought after sections among Indian taxpayers as it allows the benefits of reducing taxable income by ₹1.5 lakh every year from their income. The benefit of this section that can be availed by individuals and Hindu Undivided Families (HUFs) only includes the principal amount repaid towards home loan among other eligible investments for tax deduction purposes. Section 24: This section is of great interest to home loan borrowers as it allows deduction of up to ₹2 lakh on home loan interest provided the property bought is self-occupied by the borrower and his/her family. However, the total interest amount is written off as a deduction if the property is let out on rent. Section 80EEA: This new section introduced to boost the ‘Housing for All by 2022’ programme of the Indian government allows home loan borrowers to seek an additional ₹1.5 lakh deduction every year over and above the ₹2 lakh deduction enjoyed under Section 24. Since Section 80EEA was introduced to encourage people investing in property for the first time, the benefits under this section cannot be claimed by those who already own a property. Besides, borrowers may seek loan only from recognised financial institutions including commercial banks and housing finance companies, for a property whose stamp duty value does not exceed ₹45 lakh. The loan for the property must be sought between April 01, 2019 and March 31, 2022. Let’s take an example The principal and interest components of the home loan equated monthly instalments are likely to change every year. So, it makes sense to be aware of the loan repayment break up well in advance for better tax planning. Let us assume that you have purchased a property worth ₹50 lakh for which you have secured a home loan to the tune of ₹40 lakh. Many banks and finance houses are offering loans at interest rates as low as 6.7%. You may choose to avail the loan at fixed rates or floating rates depending on your convenience and ease of payment. Assuming that the loan has been sought for 20 years, the total interest payable on the loan would be equal to ₹32,70,985, thus, taking the total repayable amount to ₹72,70,985. The yearly instalment repayable would be ₹3,63,549. A breakup of the instalment would yield ₹2,65,011 as interest paid on the loan in the first year while ₹98,539 would be towards the principal repayment in the first year itself. Irrespective of your earnings every year, you can claim ₹98,539 (principal paid) deduction under Section 80C. The remaining ₹51,461 of the total amount of ₹1.5 lakh, which this section permits you to seek tax benefit, can be claimed under the same section from the stamp duty payment. However, deduction on stamp duty payment is valid only for the first year. Out of the total interest paid during the first year [to use the same example as above, ₹2,65,011], you can claim ₹2 lakh tax deduction under Section 24 if the property is self-occupied. The remaining interest payment of ₹65,011 can be claimed under Section 80EEA of the Act. However, if you have given out the property on rent, you can claim deduction on the entire interest amount paid in the first year under Section 24 of the Act. This way, you have benefited from the total tax deduction of ₹3,63,549 in the first year of taking the loan. Joint home loans The Income Tax benefit rules for first time home buyers remain the same even in the case of joint home loans, i.e., home loans taken jointly by husband and wife or by parent and child or by siblings. The benefit of deductions cannot be more than the amount paid towards the loan. This means that for a self-occupied property, one spouse can claim a tax deduction benefit of ₹2, 00,000 under Section 24 while the other can seek deduction up to the remaining amount of ₹65, 011 under the same section. When it comes to seeking tax deduction on the principal amount [ ₹98,539 in this example], one of the partners can either claim full exemption or both the partners can split the amount to claim a deduction depending on how they plan their taxes. This means that either one of the partners in the loan can claim a deduction of ₹98,539 under Section 80C or both the partners can split the principal amount to claim a deduction as per their tax planning.

12-04-2021||Other||Modified DBT for wheat procurement to run into procedural hassles in Punjab||Punjab’s decision to implement the Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) system of transferring the Minimum Support Price (MSP) for wheat directly into farmers’ accounts is likely to run into hiccups. The state food department faces the task of streamlining bank accounts of 12.5 lakh farmers. There could be chaotic scenes and slow progress, even as procurement started on Saturday (April 10).“This is a first for us and for implementation, several new procedures have to be designed. Account detail of each farmer has to be verified. For this, we are seeking support from the National Payment Corporation of India (NCPI),” said a general manager rank officer of the state food and civil supplies department, adding that confirmation of the NCPI will take a few days and payment was likely to be delayed. Rules, however, stipulate, that payment must be done within 48 hours after procurement. This year, 130 lakh tonne wheat is expected to be procured, for which 3,700 mandis have been set up, as 50% (1,850) have been added to ensure covid norms can be followed. Farmers have been issued tokens to bring produce in a scattered manner. Wheat arrival was negligible on the second day on Sunday, practically the first day of procurement, as arhtiyas were on strike against the DBT on Saturday.Arhtiyas called off their strike after CM Capt Amarinder Singh ordered steps to ensure their continued involvement in the procurement process. He also ordered release of ₹131 crore of their dues, without waiting for the money to come from the Food Corporation of India (FCI). The state food department is in the process of amending the payment software, Public Finance Management System (PFMS), so that the arhtiyas will continue to be involved in the process of release of payments to farmers, in a modified manner. MASTER TRAINERS TRAINED The department is in process of training master trainers in all 22 districts, who will then train users of PFMS. “The system needs to be updated to bring in arhtiyas’ role in the procurement system,” said an officer. Food and civil supplies minister Bharat Bhusuan Ashu said, “The new system is complicated, for which training is on. Things would be under control soon.” The Punjab Mandi Board has issued contact numbers of the State Control Room set up at its headquarters in Mohali. The numbers have been made operational in all 22 districts. Board chairman Lal Singh said health protocols and social distancing measures would be followed to check Covid-19. He added that farmers must download ‘epmb mobile app’ of the Mandi Board to get e-passes for wheat procurement. Farmers and arthiyas are to contact secretary, market committee, for any issue related to procurement. In case, their problem was not resolved, they can contact their respective district control room numbers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/modified-dbt-for-wheat-procurement-to-run-into-procedural-hassles-in-punjab-101618169496504.html
12-04-2021||Mumbai||Pvt hosps can set up vax camps in private offices: BMC||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) will now allow private hospitals to set up Covid-19 vaccination camps at private offices too. Also, starting Monday, vaccination at 62 private hospitals, which was suspended on Friday owing to shortage of vaccine doses, will resume in the city. The BMC on Friday had announced complete closure of all private hospitals acting as vaccination centres owing to shortage of vaccines in the city. The shortage of vaccines was reflecting on the ground since last Tuesday when several private hospitals could not vaccinate owing to shortage of vaccines. Speaking on tie-up with private offices, Dr Mangala Gomare, chief of BMC’s public health department said, “We will give permissions to private hospitals to tie up with offices having over 100 employees to set up vaccination camps there. This will help us cover maximum citizens in the permitted age group.” This is in line with Central government’s guidelines, civic officials said. Dr Gomare added, “There will be a set of protocols to be followed by private hospitals like having doctors and an emergency vehicle in case of adverse effect. The whole process will be done as per the guidelines issues by the government from time to time.” Further, according to the BMC, 62 private hospitals out of the total 71 have made the purchase for vaccines on Sunday and will restart the drive on Monday. Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner, said, “Overall, 235,000 doses were received. From Monday onwards, we will start vaccination at most private hospitals.” On Thursday, 25 private vaccination centres were shut owing to the shortage that went up to over 50 by Friday. On Friday, several government facilities also ran out of vaccine doses due to which over 50% vaccination centres were shut in the city. Overall, in the city, there are 120 vaccination centres and till now 1,635,372 citizens have been vaccinated. Of these, 257,675 are health care workers, 278,841 are frontline workers, 658,373 are citizens above the age of 60 years, and 440,843 are citizens between the ages of 45 and 59.In Dharavi, the former hotspot of the city, the BMC vaccinated 360 citizens on Sunday. Meanwhile, overall, on Sunday, 33,256 citizens were vaccinated, of which 580 were health care workers, 1,149 were front line workers, 7,290 were senior citizens above the age of 60 years and 24,237 were between the age of 45 and 59. On an average, in the city, around 50,000 citizens are vaccinated daily, but the daily average dipped due to shortage of vaccines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/pvt-hosps-can-set-up-vax-camps-in-private-offices-bmc-101618169253724.html

Of 20,252 ICU beds, 75% are occupied while 40% of 67,000 oxygen beds are also occupied in the state. Amid the grim surge, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray has been chairing meetings to impose stricter curbs in the state for a likely duration of at least two weeks. On Saturday, Thackeray said, “In last year’s lockdown, people were at home. Hence, tracing patients and most of their contacts was easier. Now, everything has opened up. There are practical difficulties in doing so.” He further said, “To break the Covid transmission chain, it is imperative that strict restrictions must be imposed for a certain period of time. The first priority will be given to saving lives. If this is a public health emergency, then the priority will be health of citizens and their lives.”Currently, besides a complete lockdown on weekends, the state government has imposed a strict night curfew of 11 hours and a prohibition of gatherings of more than five people during the day. It has also announced shutting down of shops and establishments dealing in non-essential commodities, restaurants, eateries, malls, theatres, multiplexes and religious places.Meanwhile, the Kalyan-Dombivli Municipal Corporation (KDMC) crossed the 1-lakh-cases mark on Sunday, with fresh 2,552 cases recorded on Saturday.

12-04-2021||Mumbai||Maha 1st state to administer over 10mn doses||Days since the Centre-state feud over vaccine shortage broke out, more than 1,000 centres across the state have been shut and there has been a drop of 73% in the number of doses administered. However, amid the war of words, Maharashtra has become the first state to administer more than 10 million doses of Covid-19 vaccine. It has administered 10,038,421 doses till Sunday morning, highest in the country so far, said Dr Pradeep Vyas, principal secretary, state health department. In a text reply to HT, N Ramaswamy, commissioner, national health commission, said the state received 743,280 doses of vaccine on Friday and Saturday. On Sunday, it received 877,890 doses and is expected to receive another 522,110 doses on Monday. On April 6, a day before health minister Rajesh Tope said the state was facing a shortage, Maharashtra had administered 388,071 vaccine doses across 4,239 centres. However, the numbers dropped to 282,944 doses in 2,849 centres on Saturday, as per data released by the health department on Sunday morning. Many vaccination centres started closing down starting April 8, as the doses exhausted.In a press conference earlier this week, Tope said the Centre is expected to supply 17 lakh doses post-April 15. Deputy chief minister, Ajit Pawar, on Saturday, also said the situation will be normal in the coming days. Maharashtra is aiming to administer 6 lakh doses per day and has been demanding 40 lakh doses per week from the Centre. On Saturday, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray said the state aims to increase vaccination coverage amid an increasing number of cases.He said, “Increasing vaccination coverage is the need of the hour. The youth must be vaccinated. Pfizer is planning to vaccinate adolescents between 12 and 15 years of age.” In a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi last week, Thackeray also demanded opening vaccination for all above 25 years of age. On Sunday, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) spokesperson and minister for minority affairs Nawab Malik questioned the BJP’s alleged free distribution of Remdesvir in Gujarat. He tweeted, “There is shortage of Remdesvir in the country and the BJP is distributing it for free in its office in Gujarat. Is this is not politicisation?” BJP leader and leader of opposition in the legislative council Pravin Darekar, however, released a statement saying the state government must concentrate on strengthening its own healthcare before commenting on other states. “This is not a battle between two governments. This is a battle against Covid-19. Instead of wasting time in political commentary, the state must strengthen its healthcare system,” Darekar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maha-1st-state-to-administer-over-10mn-doses-101618169132937.html
12-04-2021||Chandigarh||Road accident: ₹31.5L relief for Zirakpur family||The Motor Accident Claims Tribunal (MACT), Chandigarh, has awarded compensation of ₹31.51 lakh to the family of a Zirakpur man, who died in 2017, after a speeding car hit his motorcycle.The deceased, Ramveer Singh, used to run a travel agency.Sarita, the deceased’s widow, and her three children had filed a claim petition against the driver of the car, Chaukas Singh from Dera Bassi, the car’s owner, Gurmeet from Ambala and insurer Iffco-Tokio General Insurance Company Limited, Chandigarh.The petition stated that on October 13, 2017, Ramveer was going from his house to D-Mart, Zirakpur, on a motorcycle. In front of the Magnesia Office in Zirakpur, a speeding Tata Indica car hit his motorcycle from behind, leaving him grievously injured.“The driver of the car stopped his car and came out, but on seeing Ramveer seriously injured, he ran from the spot,” the petition added.He succumbed to his injuries two days later. Following his death, the claim petition was filed.In their written statement, Chaukas Singh and Gurmeet denied the accident and said that the FIR registered was false. The insurer claimed that the car’s driver was not holding a valid driving license at the time of the alleged accident and hence, there being breach of insurance policy, and it is under no obligation to indemnify the insured.After hearing the arguments, the MACT directed the insurance company to pay ₹31.51 lakh to the family within two months from the date of order, along with interest @ 6% per annum from the date of filing of the petition.Sarita will get 55% of the total compensation amount, while the children will get 15% each in cash.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/road-accident-31-5l-relief-for-zirakpur-family-101618168473298.html
12-04-2021||Chandigarh||Five of Haryana gang held for firing in Chandigarh||After making two arrests, police have managed to nab the remaining three men who vandalised vehicles and opened fire at Sector 38 (West) on the morning of April 8. They belong to a Haryana-based gang, said the police. While Raj Kumar, 24, of Dadumajra and Abhishek, 23, from Sector 25 were nabbed earlier, the other three accused arrested later are Monu alias Marodi, 24, also from Sector 25, Mukesh alias Gullu, 25, and Harshdeep, 26, both from Haryana’s Gohana. They were caught on Saturday and the weapon used in firing was also recovered. Monu is also involved in 20 other cases, the police said. The members of the gang from Sonepat’s Gohana, the police said, were previously named in murder, highway robbery and attempt to murder cases. Upon interrogation, the accused confessed that they had planned to extend their influence in Chandigarh by spreading terror and conspired to extort money from patriwalas, meat sellers and shopkeepers. Immediately after this incident, they had returned to Haryana to execute another murder, the cops said. Besides the countrymade pistol used on April 8, the police have also recovered two similar guns and a sword. The complainant, Davinder of Sector 38 (west), had said that at least five inebriated persons, who were in a white Mahindra Scorpio bearing a Haryana registration number, smashed the windscreens of his Tata Safari and his neighbour’s Maruti Zen. The vehicles were parked outside their houses.Closed-circuit television (CCTV) footage showed two suspects carrying a stick and a sword, while another was pelting stones at the vehicles.A case under sections 147 (rioting), 149 (every member of unlawful assembly guilty of offence commit­ted in prosecution of common object), 336 (act endangering life or personal safety of others), 427 (mischief causing damage), and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the IPC was registered initially, while Section 307 (attempt to murder) and provisions under the Arms Act were added to the FIR later.

12-04-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh’s public transport needs an overhaul: Study||Chandigarh, the city with highest density of vehicle ownership in the country and plagued with severe parking problems, needs to go for a major overhaul of its public transport system. A report by CEPT University, Ahmedabad, which was instituted by the Chandigarh transport department under the World Bank-sponsored Intelligent Transport System project, has highlighted major weaknesses in the city’s public transport. With only 11% population regularly using the bus service, nearly 80% Chandigarh Transport Undertaking buses, on an average, run vacant. “The load factor (bus seat capacity being occupied) of the service is around 22%, which is much lower than the desired range of 65-75%,” states the report, which was submitted to the administration in March. One of the reasons is the low trust on the system. “On an average 8% trips are cancelled daily without any prior information,” states the report after a year-long survey of the Chandigarh’s public transport system that was undertaken before Covid-19 restrictions were imposed in 2020. The report also notes that the public transport is highly centralised with most routes originating at interstate bus terminals in Sectors 17 and 43 or at the PGIMER, and only 45% of the city covered. “Concentration of routes on some corridors in the city leads to oversupply and also creates confusion for occasional passengers,” reads the report. Low frequencyAround 66% of 3.1 lakh daily trips in the city are performed by intermediate public transport (IPT), such as autos. However, even their frequency is low, leading to high dependency on private vehicles, notes the report. “The frequency of IPT is also very low, around 10 minutes, and fare levels are around 33-55% higher for trip lengths greater than 3km,” it says. The report states that CTU buses are being underutilised, with the average being 187km on weekdays, which is below the benchmark of 200km per bus on road daily for urban bus service. “Not surprisingly, against an operating revenue of ₹11.56 crore, the operating cost for CTU in 2017-2018 was ₹23.85 crore. The situation worsened in 2018-2019, with revenue at ₹14.17 crore and the cost increasing to ₹26.98 crore,” states the report. PPP model neededThe report has suggested involvement of private operators in running and managing public transport through public private partnership (PPP) model.“Chandigarh would require about a total of 420 to 1,000 buses depending on the level of service (LOS) targeted. As per the central benchmarks, cities should have a minimum of 0.4 buses per 1,000 population as LOS-1. Currently, 330 buses, ie 0.17 buses per 1,000 population, are operated by the CTU,” states the study. To improve accessibility, an average distance between stops is taken as 350-400 metre within developed areas, and Chandigarh needs 84 more bus stops to achieve that, says the report. The bus network has to cover 90% of the city, so that the service is available within 5-7 minutes of walking distance to everyone. Also, a minimum frequency of three to four buses per hour is needed at a stop. The study has also called for rationalisation of bus fares, ranging from ₹5 for up to 2km to ₹25 for more than 10km.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarhs-public-transport-needs-an-overhaul-study-101618168174134.html
12-04-2021||Chandigarh||Mohali to get additional water supply by July 31: GMADA||After eight years, the Greater Mohali Area Development Authority (Gmada) has finally set a deadline of July 31 for the additional supply of five million gallon daily (MGD) water from phases 5 and 6 of Kajauli waterworks.The previous deadline of the project was December 2020, but it was delayed due to the pandemic.Mohali is short of 10 MGD water and the demand shoots up to 12 MGD in summers.Gmada chief engineer Davinder Singh said, “The construction work of water treatment plant, which is coming up at Mohali’s Singhpur, is in full swing. We have set a deadline of July 31 and on the same day, Mohali residents will get additional five MGD water.”The construction of the plant has already been delayed owing to the indecision over capacity (whether to build it for five MGD or 20 MGD). Gmada has now decided to go with the second option. The project, which is being developed by a Vadodara-based company, will cost ₹100 crore. Chandigarh, meanwhile, has already started receiving its additional 35 MGD water under phases 5 and 6.Acute shortageFor the past several years, Mohali has been reeling under acute water shortage as the gap between demand and supply in the city stretches up to 10 MGD.MC councillor Kuljeet Singh Bedi, who had filed a case in the Punjab and Haryana High Court regarding shortage of water in Mohali, said, “The project has been delayed due to lackadaisical attitude of the officials concerned. It is unfortunate that the public had to suffer for years due to shortage of water.”In May 2012, Gmada had started laying pipelines to supply 80 MGD water to Mohali and Chandigarh from Kajauli waterworks at a cost of ₹200 crore, half of which was borne by Chandigarh.Presently, Mohali gets 10 MGD water from Kajauli waterworks and 10 MGD from 75 tubewells. Kajauli waterworks is located on Bhakra mainline canal near Morinda in Rupnagar district from where water requirement of Chandigarh, Mohali and Chandimandir are met.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/mohali-to-get-additional-water-supply-by-july-31-gmada-101618168054040.html

The department has claimed that over 517 inmates lodged across various jails in the state are foreign nationals and do not have Aadhaar cards and should instead be allowed to avail a vaccine shot by showing their passport. As per data released by the National Crime Records Bureau, till December 2019, the state had 517 foreign inmates (51 convicts and 466 undertrials), of which 408 are males and 109 females. The Arthur Road jail (Mumbai Central), Byculla women’s prison, Thane jail, Taloja Central Jail, Kalyan Adharwadi jail and Yerwada Central Jail (Pune) alone have more than 250 foreign inmates. These inmates are mostly from Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Nigeria and other African countries, as well as from the Middle East and South America. “We have written to the state government about the issues over making Aadhaar card mandatory for vaccination. We have requested to waive the rule off for prisoners across Maharashtra, irrespective of their nationality,” Sunil Ramanand, additional director general (ADG) of police (prison), said. A jail officer from Maharashtra jail has claimed that the only documents foreign inmates have is a passport. “The passport is the valid document through which they came to India. They submit the passport in court after they are arrested. The government should allow passports as documents for vaccination. Our aim is to vaccinate every prisoner and keep them safe from the virus,” said the officer. Sources from Maharashtra prison department said that even many Indian inmates do not possess an Aadhaar card. The vaccination process across the prisons in the state for inmates above 60 years and above and then for those in the 45-59 age group began last month as per the central government guidelines. “But this is merely 10% of the inmates. Many jails are overcrowded and the government should set up different guidelines for jails,” said a prison department source. “Moreover, inmates are taken to hospital for vaccination everyday. We need staff to guard the inmates on a regularly for the purpose. If the vaccination drive is started at jails, it would be a safer for guards as well as the inmates,” said the official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/waive-aadhaar-card-rule-for-vaccinating-inmates-maharashtra-prison-dept-to-state-101618168052700.html

The woman was detained and sent to the NGO’s custody by the magistrate for a year so that she could be treated for a sexually transmitted disease (STD). The woman challenged the order stating that she was a survivor and had two minor daughters, and hence, could not stay in detention. HC allowed her release after medical reports stated that the woman did not have HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) nor did she require treatment for STD. The single-judge bench of justice AS Gadkari, while hearing the woman’s application, was informed by advocate Ashley Cusher that though the woman was a survivor under the Immoral Trafficking (Prevention) Act, the magistrate had sent her to the custody of NGO Rescue Foundation as she had tested positive for Treponema Pallidum Elisa (TPE) test. In an earlier hearing, Cusher had submitted that the woman was married and her daughters needed their mother’s care, and hence, she had applied for her release before the sessions court. However, as the sessions court had rejected her application, she had approached HC. After hearing the submissions and in light of the fact that the woman was an adult, the court observed that her detention was not required. On April 7, based on HC’s order, the NGO’s advocate Shehzad Naqvi submitted two medical certificates, attached to Mumbai District Aids Control Society and Bharat Ratna Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar Municipal General Hospital, which stated that the woman had tested negative for HIV and no treatment was required for the STD. The court then directed the NGO to release the woman on the condition that she gives an undertaking that she would be present at the time of the trial and disposed of the application.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/release-rescued-woman-detained-for-std-treatment-bombay-hc-to-ngo-101618167872751.html

The man, an engineer, had sought quashing of the criminal proceedings based on the delay by the IO, as he was unable to apply for a passport and work abroad due to the criminal case against him. The HC, while directing the inquiry against the IO, quashed the criminal proceedings against the accused. The division bench of justice SS Shinde and justice Manish Pitale, while hearing the petition of the engineer, was informed by advocate Shravan Giri that at the time of the incident, his client was an engineering student. After securing his degree, the man got a job in a reputed organisation and was also offered a promotion that enabled him to work in Oman. However, due to pendency of criminal proceedings, the man could not apply for a passport, and hence lost the said opportunity, Giri submitted. The petition stated that as the employer has kept the offer open, the man approached HC and sought that the criminal proceedings and the order of cognisance of offence taken by the magistrate be quashed and set aside on the grounds that the stipulated time for initiating such proceedings had lapsed as per law.Seven years ago, on March 3, a constable from Bandra police station had lodged a first information report (FIR) against the petitioner and 13 others for offences punishable under sections 279 (rash driving or riding) and 336 (endangering life or personal safety of others) of the Indian Penal Code. The accused were apprehended for riding motorcycles in rash and negligent manner at high speed. Giri submitted that the case was still pending and even a roznama (register of proceedings) had not been properly maintained by the magistrate court. He added that as the sentences prescribed under the offences were of six and three months, and the magistrate took cognisance of them in 2017, the same was barred as the limitation period for such cognisance had lapsed. However, additional public prosecutor KV Saste for the police opposed the petition and said that the case could be remanded to the magistrate to consider extension of limitation period, and hence, the proceedings should not be quashed. After hearing the submissions, the bench observed that the cognisance of the offence could have been taken only up to one year from the date of offence. “The request for remanding the matter back to the magistrate cannot be granted. There is nothing to show that the magistrate either applied his mind to the aspect of expiry of limitation or condoning the delay,” the bench observed. In light of these observations, the court held that the criminal proceedings against the petitioner was not sustainable and hence quashed and set aside the same. The bench then directed the police commissioner to initiate an appropriate inquiry against the IO concerned “who took more than one year for filing a report in such a trivial matter”, and said that the inquiry report be produced within three months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/inquire-why-cop-took-a-year-to-file-report-in-trivial-matter-bombay-hc-to-police-chief-101618167754366.html
12-04-2021||Chandigarh||Hospital for stray dogs coming up in Chandigarh||A state-of-the-art dedicated hospital and laboratory for stray dogs will become operational within a month at Raipur Kalan village in Chandigarh.The new facility, which is part of the Animal Birth Control Centre, is coming up on a two-acre plot. It will also have a dog pound to house around 500 stray dogs and sterilise about 1,000 dogs.Along with sterilisation of unclaimed dogs at the centre, their vaccination will also be done. For this, a special team will be appointed by the MC.The hospital will also tend to injured dogs. These dogs will be kept under the supervision of the team for treatment, and will be later returned to the same place from where they were picked.The MC has invited firms to start the sterilisation programme. A tender has been floated after the MC General House approved it in its February meeting.“A 21-day period has been given for the tender to be filled. After the tender is allotted, the centre will start. The agency will have to sterilise 150 dogs per month,” said an MC official connected with the project.If it does not meet this target, then a penalty will be charged at ₹100 per dog and it will be deducted from the monthly bill of the agency. The work will be allotted for one year.Currently, sterilisation is going on at the centre in Sector 38. In the latest MC drive started in September last year, around 2,500 dogs have been sterilised so far.The city has been witnessing a rapid increase in the stray dog population and the number of dog bite cases has also gone up by 35% in the last five years, according to the MC records. According to the latest animal census, conducted by the UT animal husbandry and fisheries department, the number of stray dogs reached 12,900 in 2019, up from 7,847 in the last census conducted in 2012. The city has anti-rabies clinics in Sector 19 and Sector 38, where around 30 to 35 dog bite cases are being reported daily.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hospital-for-stray-dogs-coming-up-in-chandigarh-101618167753925.html
12-04-2021||Mumbai||After Mumbai Police’s crime branch, it’s EOW’s turn to ‘clean up’||After Mumbai Police’s crime branch, the economic offences wing (EOW) could be the next department to face a “clean up” drive initiated by Hemant Nagrale, new Mumbai Police commissioner. Nagrale, who has taken up the uphill task of cleaning up the city police force and has shunted out over 65 crime branch officers who served in the crime branch for over five years, has now decided to give a similar treatment to the EOW. According to sources, officers who are serving in the EOW since more than four years are expected to be transferred out. Recently, joint commissioner of police (EOW) Niket Kaushik, who is known for his upright approach in decision making, recently issued an order to all the EOW unit heads hinting them about possible transfers soon. Kaushik’s order, a copy of which is with HT, stated, “Possible transfers of those officers who are completing four years in EOW as of May 31, 2021, cannot be ruled out in upcoming general transfers (which occurs every year in June). Hence all unit heads are hereby directed henceforth not to give such officers the investigation of new cases.”EOW, which investigates multi-crore banking/financial institute scams, corporate frauds, investment frauds, housing frauds by builders and other white collar crimes, also has officers who have been there since ages.Generally, a police officer is supposed to serve at a post for a period of three years and then be transferred to other posting. But, EOW sources said, “There are officers here (in EOW) who have been in the department since six-seven years by merely switching their postings within the EOW during transfers.” Now all these officers would be moved out to other police departments, which could be local police stations or side branches.“Once the lot of such officers are transferred out, 45-50% posts of officers in EOW would go vacant. These posts would be filled up with new officers,” said an EOW officer requesting anonymity.EOW officers, who are expecting transfers, are now busy winding up old cases which are with them for years, department sources told HT.Unlike the sudden order for crime branch and its immediate implementation, transfers in EOW would be effected during regular general transfers in June. “Immediate remedial measure with the crime branch was the need of the hour to send a strong message across a particular department, but same was not the case with EOW,” said a police officer from the headquarters.After controversies surrounding tainted crime branch officer Sachin Vaze and former police commissioner Param Bir Singh’s transfer, the Maharashtra government in mid-March entrusted deputy general of police (DGP) Hemant Nagrale with the responsibility of bringing back the lost glory of Mumbai Police. After taking charge on March 17, Nagrale first started with taking on cops who might have had developed close proximity with unwarranted elements by enjoying long tenure in the same department. Within six days of joining, he shunted out 65 crime branch officers. Explaining these transfers Rajkumar Vhatkar, joint commissioner of police (Administration) said, “The transfers of policemen are governed by the Police Act where the prescribed service tenure is defined. Since crime branch officers require special skills which are acquired out of experience in the field, the Crime Branch officers were kept in the branch for long, for administrative convenience. But of late, it is observed that some of the officers developed vested interests. Hence, objective criteria was applied and all the officers who completed five years in the branch at a stretch or have done more than 10 years with some break in between, have been transferred out.” By inducting new officers in the branch, the department feels some fresh perspective can be brought in, which will help strengthen the Crime Branch and will perform with fresh zeal and enthusiasm. Another senior IPS officer said, “The commissioner’s clean up drive aims to uproot the nexus or connivance of policemen with the wrong elements that ultimately encourage corruption in the police department. Such nexus or connivance makes policemen overconfident and makes them indulge in unethical practices, which eventually could lead to another API Sachin Vaze-like episode which has brought tremendous embarrassment, shame and disrepute to the Mumbai Police, once considered a highly-reputed police force in the country.”Speaking of Vaze, a senior IPS officer said Vaze was given a completely free hand by former commissioner Singh and added that he was so patronised by his “godfather” that he had become super arrogant in terms of behaviour. “He would come to police headquarters in high-end private cars, issue orders to officers in any department, not respecting colleagues and not even saluting senior police officers. Such arrogance makes a policeman more vulnerable in breaching the discipline,” a senior officer said on condition of anonymity. Those policemen who have been serving at the police stations of Mumbai for over five years will also be transferred and would be posted at side branches soon. “If a policeman serves at a post for a longer period, then he forms groups around him and is bound to indulge in unethical practices; therefore transfers are necessary,” another senior IPS officer said, adding, “The process has already been started with the constabulary at several police stations.”Sources in the police headquarters said not just crime branch and EOW, but many other important departments at the headquarters would also be covered under the move. “Police personnel posted at various departments that look after licensing and permissions for dance bars, permit rooms, hotels and other establishments would also be transferred, if serving at the same office for a long period,” said an officer.“Transferring policemen does not mean that all those who have been transferred are corrupt. Many of them served the force exceptionally well and earned respect, name and fame. But, the practice (of transfers) is aimed to send a message that it is the system that has made them big and achieve expertise in a field, and not vice versa. No one is above the system. Others should also get the opportunity to hone their skills and serve the society. Overstaying at one post make policemen vulnerable to wrongful and unethical practices, who then willingly or unwillingly become part of the system designed to benefit wrong people,” another IPS officer said. When asked what other measures are in the offing, Nagrale said, “You’ll know when it’s done.” He refused to elaborate further on the transfer strategy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/after-mumbai-police-s-crime-branch-it-s-eow-s-turn-to-clean-up-101618167632705.html

While Harjit was sleeping with his father Ram Kumar, 35, mother Geeta, 30, and two siblings, Amit and Adisha, in the room, his grandmother was sleeping outside the room. Neighbours rushed to the house after hearing a thud. After rescuing the family from under two-foot-deep debris, the neighbours rushed them to the civil hospital in Dera Bassi. Doctors referred them to Government Medical College and Hospital, Sector 32, Chandigarh, where Harjit underwent an operation but could not survive. “The house had a kacha roof, due to which it weakened and collapsed. The boy died due to suffocation after getting trapped under the debris. However, no one from the family sustained physical injuries. They have been discharged. The family has refused to get the boy’s postmortem conducted,” said Kuldeep Bawa, subdivisional magistrate, Dera Bassi. Dera Bassi MLA and Shiromani Akali Dal leader NK Sharma visited the spot and demanded better housing for the poor. He alleged the state government has not released funds under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana and sought full compensation and a government job for Harjit’s family.Deepinder Singh Dhillon, Congress halqa incharge from Zirakpur, said the family will be given compensation from the chief minister’s relief fund at the earliest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/11yearold-boy-dies-as-roof-of-his-house-collapses-in-mohali-101618167513785.html

Raut said that 14 ministers in the previous BJP-led Devendra Fadnavis government faced serious allegations, but none of them were shunted out. They continued to hold power by not resigning from their positions, he said. Raut alleged that a conspiracy was going on “behind the curtains” to bring the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government down by “misusing central investigation agencies”, but the Opposition will not succeed in doing so.In his column in Sena mouthpiece Saamana, Raut said, “State BJP chief Chandrakant Patil said that in the past 36 days, two ministers from the state had to resign from their posts and indicated that a few more will be shunted out. Our [MVA] ministers resigned on moral grounds, but in the erstwhile Fadnavis government, 14 ministers who faced serious allegations chose to stick to power.”Nationalist Congress Party’s (NCP) Anil Deshmukh, who was handling the home portfolio, had resigned on April 5 after the high court directed the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to probe allegations of corruption against him. On February 28, Sanjay Rathod from the Sena, who was handling the forest department, resigned from the ministerial council after his name was dragged in a suicide case of a Tiktok star. “The Opposition [BJP] is leaving no stone unturned to malign the image of MVA government. It has become necessary to give them a befitting reply or else people will start believing their lies after a few days,” Raut wrote.“Attempts are on to dislodge the government. The [BJP-led] central government too is involved in it. But there is no possibility of it happening. Soon after HC’s decision directing a CBI inquiry into the allegations against the then home minister [Deshmukh], Union law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad raised the issue of morality and slammed chief minister Uddhav Thackeray. But their [BJP] morality is only to create trouble against the governments led by opposition [non-BJP] parties by misusing central probe agencies,” he said.In his response, BJP spokesperson Keshav Upadhye said the allegations against BJP ministers were of political nature. “As always, he [Raut] is misleading people as the facts are different from what he claims. The allegations made against the then home minister [Anil Deshmukh] was by former Mumbai police chief Param Bir Singh and the high court ordered a CBI inquiry against him. There was a public outcry against Rathod. In contrast, there were political allegations against BJP ministers in Fadnavis government,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/14-of-ministers-in-ex-maharashtra-cm-s-cabinet-faced-allegations-but-none-resigned-sanjay-raut-101618167453284.html

They were questioned till 8.30pm. Vaze’s drivers, whose names have not been revealed, reached DRDO guest house at 4pm and were being questioned till the time of going to print. CBI took their statements to find out if Deshmukh had asked Vaze and assistant commissioner of police Sanjay Patil to collect ₹100 crore from hotels, bars and restaurants in the city, as alleged by Singh in his eight-page letter to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on March 20. Singh had also mentioned in his letter that when Patil went to meet Deshmukh at the latter’s residence, Palande and Shinde were present there. A CBI team, which is in Mumbai to conduct a preliminary inquiry into the allegations against Deshmukh as directed by the Bombay high court (HC), had also recorded Singh’s statement on April 8 – a day after Vaze attempted to submit a letter to the special court in which he stated that Deshmukh and state transport minister Anil Parab had asked him to extort money from entrepreneurs and establishments. Deshmukh and Parab had denied the allegations. Deshmukh had resigned from the cabinet on April 5 after the HC order. In an official report submitted on April 7, newly appointed Mumbai Police commissioner Hemant Nagrale said all critical decisions related to arrests and raids in the Antilia explosives scare probe were taken under the directions of Vaze, who was then an assistant police inspector (API). The report stated that though an API does not usually report directly to the police chief, Vaze had reported directly to Singh.Previously, CBI had also recorded the statements of deputy commissioner of police Raju Bhujbal, Patil, and Jaishri Patil – who petitioned HC for independent probe into the corruption allegations.The agency also recorded Vaze’s statement – when he was in the custody of National Investigation Agency (NIA) in the Antilia explosives case. To corroborate the allegations made by Singh, CBI also recorded the statement of a Kandivli bar owner, who was allegedly extorting money each month from other restaurant owners at the behest of a former police officer.NIA is probing the case of an explosives-laden SUV parked outside industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s residence on February 25. Vaze was arrested in the case as well as in the alleged murder of Thane businessman Mansukh Hiran, who was linked to the SUV placed outside Antilia. Hiran’s wife Vimla said Vaze was using the SUV since last November till February 5. Hiran, a spare parts trader, was allegedly murdered on March 4, the day he went missing. His body was found floating in a creek at Retibunder in Mumbra the next day. Along with Vaze, former police constable Vinayak Shinde and cricket bookie Naresh Ramniklal Gor are also arrested in the case.The Maharashtra anti-terrorism squad (ATS) was investigating the Hiran murder case, before it was handed over to NIA. The Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government had also constituted a committee on March 30 under retired justice KU Chandiwal to probe the allegations levelled against Anil Deshmukh. But experts told the government that the findings of the panel would have limited legal standings as the CBI probe would have wider scope.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/cbi-quizzes-staff-of-anil-deshmukh-and-former-mumbai-cop-sachin-vaze-101618167272731.html

I recently bought a cycle-rickshaw to earn and support my family. The fire completely damaged the vehicle and I am now jobless. I have lost roti, kapda and makan,” he said, adding that goods and valuables inside his shanty were also burnt. Babita Devi managed to pull her two-year-old son just in time to safety when the fire broke out. “The boy was playing outside when the fire took place. He was not even wearing pants. Now, we have no money to buy clothes to cover him,” she lamented.There were many who were forced to escape leaving all their valuables behind, while many lost even their mobile phones in the blaze. Kusum Devi, another resident, said: “Our two motorcycles, some property documents, cash, clothes, etc. have all been lost in the fire. My husband was in the scrap dealing business.

12-04-2021||Noida||Two children die as 150 shanties gutted in Noida||Noida: Two children died and some people received minor burn injuries when a massive fire gutted around 150 shanties at Bahlolpur village in Noida Sector 63 on Sunday afternoon. Local residents claimed that the fire tenders reached the spot late. Govind, a resident, said that the incident took place around 1pm and the locals immediately informed police and the fire department. “They (fire tenders) reached the spot about 3pm. By that time everything was burnt down,” he said, adding that he lost goods and valuables worth ₹3 lakh in the incident. Arun Kumar, chief fire safety officer, said that it took some time to reach the spot due to narrow road. “We received the information at 2pm. There was no delay from our side,” he said. The fire department had engaged 17 fire tenders to douse the fire, the officer said, adding that the cause of fire is not known.According to police, two children -- Paro aged two years and Doll aged six years -- died in the incident.Harish Chander, deputy commissioner of police, said it appears that the fire was caused due to short circuit or a cylinder blast. “The fire intensified due to hot weather conditions. Two children died and about 150 shanties were burnt. It appears they were sleeping and could not leave on time,” he said.Most of the victims are natives of Bihar. They are involved in scrap dealing, rickshaw pulling, and other smalltime jobs. Satish Kumar, a tailor who escaped narrowly, said, “I was taking a nap in the afternoon. There was a sudden noise and my children rushed in and informed that there was a fire in Birju’s shanty,” he said. The shanty of Birju, a scrap dealer who is presently in Bihar, was locked, Satish said. “It appears that a short-circuit in Birju’s house led to the fire,” he said. Satish was living there on rent with his wife Kanti Devi and two children. Kusum Devi, another resident, said that Sharman’s two daughters died in the incident. “Sharman, a scrap dealer, is in Bihar while his wife is looking after their eight daughters. When the fire broke out, she managed to rescue six daughters while two were caught in the fire and died,” she said. Some residents said there were about 500 shanties. A spot visit by HT showed the shanties were located on two plots divided by a five feet wall. The fire had damaged shanties on both sides. The plot was covered by residential societies on three sides while a road crosses on one side near Hanuman temple. Burnt stoves, beds, gas cylinders, utensils, scrap materials, among other things, were scattered around. Several cycle rickshaws parked in the area were also damaged. The DCP said that the UP government has announced ₹4 lakh ex gratia for the deceased’s kin and also assured of setting up the shanties again. He further said that a total of 163 families have been identified whose shanties were gutted in the incident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/two-children-die-as-150-shanties-gutted-in-noida-101618166372619.html

12-04-2021||Mumbai||Conduct exams according to schedule: National medical body||At a time when undergraduate medical students are requesting the state government to postpone medical exams, scheduled to begin on April 19, a statement released by the National Medical Commission (NMC) has maintained that exams should be conducted as per schedule.In the statement dated April 9, the director of the Undergraduate Medical Education Board of NMC said, “Considering various representations seeking guidance for the conduct of the final MBBS examinations in view of Covid-19 pandemic, it is decided that all exams should be conducted by the concerned universities as per their scheduled timeline.” It further advises universities to strictly adhere to the existing safety norms while conducting these exams.Over the past few days, second- and third-year medical students from several government and private medical colleges in Maharashtra approached the state medical education minister as well as the Maharashtra University of Health Sciences (MUHS), requesting postponement of exams especially at a time when the state is recording 50,000-60,000 cases daily.The exams in question were originally scheduled to take place in February, and were postponed first to March and then to April by the MUHS due to increasing Covid-19 cases and complaints of several medical students. According to the letter addressed to MUHS by students, close to 500 students from several medical colleges in Mumbai, Pune, Nashik, Satara and Solapur are currently in quarantine after testing positive, while many others have family members who tested positive recently and have to follow the two-week quarantine period.“Some students are also currently stuck in mini-containment zones, making it impossible for them to leave the residential premises. Hostels, too, are overcrowded with four students sharing a single room and bathroom, which is the main reason for increasing cases in colleges,” said a second-year student from Government Medical College, Solapur.The NMC letter, however, has clarified that exams should be conducted and in case external coordinators from outside the state are not available due to the current scenario, universities have been asked to invite other external examiners from the same health university for exams. “The internal examiners must conduct the exams physically on the same premises,” states the letter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/conduct-exams-according-to-schedule-national-medical-body-101618166252616.html

12-04-2021||Other||UP receives 20 lakh doses of Covid vaccine||The Covid vaccination in Uttar Pradesh has got a boost as the Centre has provided it 20 lakh doses of the Covid vaccine. So far, the state government has vaccinated 85 lakh beneficiaries (till Sunday).A state government spokesperson said due to the effort of CM Yogi Adityanath, who had been reviewing the vaccination campaign daily since its launch on January 16 this year, UP had taken an edge over other states in Covid vaccination.Several states, including Maharashtra, were facing vaccine shortage due to their failure in formulating a concrete plan for Covid vaccination, he said. The UP government prepared different plans for treatment and vaccination of people. The targeted vaccination programme was launched in the state with the launch of the vaccination campaign in January. Till Sunday, 72,72,734 people had got the first dose of the vaccine and 12,42,562 both the first and the second dose. In total, 85,15,269 people have received Covid vaccine jabs so far.Director general (family welfare) Dr Rakesh Dubey said, “15,13,051 health care workers (health workers), 12,09,191 front line workers and 57,93,054 citizens have got Covid vaccine dose till April 11. Of them, 6,03,394 health care workers, 4,27,228 front line workers and 2,11,940 citizens have also received the second dose of the vaccine.”Dubey further said 28.2 lakh vaccine doses had been given in just 10 days in April. The vaccination programme got a thrust with the introduction of vaccination of the people above 45 on April 1.“The increase in the pace of Covid infection also forced people to take vaccine at the earliest. The demand for vaccine has increased rapidly across the state. On an average, 2.5 to 3 lakh beneficiaries are given vaccine jabs daily,” he added.On April 5, maximum 5.17 lakh people were vaccinated. Among the 85,15,296 vaccine doses given to people, 76 lakh were given Covishield and eight lakh were given Covaxin vaccines. “The state has received large quantity of the Covishield vaccine manufactured by Serum Institute followed Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin vaccine,” he said.The data of Covid vaccination in the districts were being monitored regularly. Balrampur and Auraiya districts bagged first and second position in the vaccination of health workers while Agra ranked last, Dubey added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/up-receives-20-lakh-doses-of-covid-vaccine-101618166012622.html

Bajrangi was shot at seven times when prisoners were being served morning tea.Taking the matter seriously, chief minister Yogi Adityanath ordered formation of a three-member committee to suggest measures for jail reforms and security inside the prison premises. The committee headed by former director general of police (DGP) Sulkhan Singh also comprised former ADG (prison) Harishankar and former IG (prison) Sharad as members.People dealing with the issue said the committee submitted the report with its recommendation to the government in October-November 2018 only but the report, they added, had been gathering dust since then.“We submitted the report to the government long back but the government is yet to accept the report/recommendations leave alone implementing the same” one of the committee members said while requesting anonymity.Additional chief secretary (home) Awanish Kumar Awasthi said he was not aware of the latest status of the report. “I cannot share the status of the report on prison reforms offhand. I will have to find out,” he said when contacted for confirmation. The three-member committee is said to have made several suggestions for strengthening security inside jail premises in such a manner as the inmates had little scope for coming out of their allotted barracks unnecessarily while also making it difficult for outsiders to sneak inside jails. “Our main recommendation was to check and track movement of prisoners in jails. We recommended that each and every movement of outsiders, jail staff and prisoners inside the jail premise must be duly recorded in registers. Reasons for any prisoner moving out of his barrack in the name of going to jail hospital etc must also be recorded and action be taken in case of violation against jail staff,” said the committee member.“Prisoners are not supposed to come out of barrack except for being taken to court, visiting jail hospital or for meeting visitors but they keep on roaming unchecked in the jail premises,” he said. The committee, according to the member, also recommended that the jail superintendents must not meet outsiders in their office inside the jail premises. “We suggested that a superintendent office be set up outside each jail as well for him to meet outsiders there,” he said. Other recommendations were about bolstering staff strength in jails and doing construction work of different nature in and outside jails. The committee during its visit to Baghpat jail found that there were only 14-15 constables posted in the jail where Munna Bajrangi was killed. The number of constables, the committee recorded, was far less vis-à-vis the number of inmates.“The barrack keys are often given to inmates only because of shortage of constables to man the barracks,” said the member.Taking a lesson from the killing of Munna Bajrangi, authorities are these days taking several steps to ensure security of Mukhtar Ansari who was reshifted to the Banda jail from Punjab a few days ago on the Supreme Court’s directives. Ansari is said to have a long bloody rivalry with Brajesh Singh, another dreaded Mafioso-turned-politician from Purvanchal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/report-on-jails-security-gathers-dust-amid-concerns-for-mukhtar-s-safety-101618165832629.html

However, this time the Ayodhya administration is yet to issue any official order in this regard.“In the larger interest of locals and in view of the pandemic the Navratri Mela this year might be scaled down. The administration is yet to make a final announcement in this regard,” said Sharad Sharma, regional spokesperson, VHP, who operates from Karsevakpuram, Ayodhya.The state government has already issued a guideline for Navratri and Ramzan, restricting entry of five people at a time at a religious place.“We will all follow the guidelines issued by the state government for Navratri. These instructions are in the larger interest of the devotees and everyone must abide by them,” said Sunil Pathak, head priest of Badi Devkali Mandir.Last year in Navratri (March 25 to April 2), the temple was closed due to the nationwide lockdown imposed to fight Covid -19 and devotees could not worship the deity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/navratri-fest-to-be-low-key-in-ayodhya-101618164212508.html

The alleged that negligible work has been done over the last one and half years, despite repeated pleas, and now, the developer extended the deadline by another year.“We have been asking the developer to expedite the construction work for the last one and half years but nothing has happened. Today (Sunday), we went to the project site for holding a meeting but the developer had called in over 40 bouncers and tried to intimidate us. We also had heated arguments as the developer has unilaterally stopped buyers from site visits and imposed impossible conditions,” said Mahipal Singh, a buyer in the project.OSB Expressway Towers project in Sector 109 was launched in November 2017, and the project delivery was scheduled for November 2021. Around 1,000 homebuyers have made purchases in the project.Singh said that despite repeated assurances, the work on the project has remained stuck and on Sunday also, there were few labourers at the site. “A majority of buyers are end-users who are paying rent as well as instalments for loans. Any further delay in delivery will break their back,” said Singh.The developer said that the work was on schedule but due to the Covid-19 lockdown, the project was delayed. “The authorities have given an extension of six to nine months due to Covid lockdown and as such, we have told the buyers that the project would be completed by June next year. Due to the lockdown, the work has been delayed. Otherwise, the constructions are on schedule,” said Sanjeev Kumar, a senior OSB official.When asked about the deployment of bouncers at the site, he said that it was a part of the security measures for the company director.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/homebuyers-in-affordable-housing-project-protest-over-construction-delays-101618162355961.html
12-04-2021||Gurugram||Gurugram, Manesar civic bodies to increase sanitation staff strength||The municipal corporations of Gurugram and Manesar (MCM) initiated steps towards increasing their allocation of resources for cleanliness measures, officials privy to the matter said on Sunday.The newly-formed Municipal Corporation of Manesar (MCM) increased the sanitation workers’ strength from 69 to 269, while the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) has decided to hire more agencies for employing contractual workers.The MCG directed senior sanitation staff members deployed in its four zones to prepare a list of sanitation workers needed for comprehensive coverage.Currently, there are 2,500 sanitation workers in Gurugram, managed by four agencies in each of MCG’s four zones. The MCG has now decided to increase the total number of agencies to 10 and increase the total number of sanitation workers to around 6,000.“Tenders for hiring new agencies for sanitation purposes have been floated by the MCG. We will be adding around 3,300 more sanitation workers. In each MCG zone, there will be workers deployed from at least two agencies while for newer sectors, we are planning on keeping two separate agencies for the task,” said a senior MCG official privy to the matter.MCG officials said that the move was necessitated due to an increase in its jurisdiction as well as the city expanding over the past five years.Sanitation workers primarily clean roads, green belts, either through manual or mechanical sweeping, and pick up trash from and dump it in municipal tractors for further disposal.The reasons for increasing sanitation workers in MCM, however, are entirely different. The MCM was established by the Haryana government in December last year and in the initial three months of operations, it had only 69 sanitation workers.Before the MCM’s formation, the Haryana State Industrial and Infrastructure Development Corporation (HSIIDC) primarily looked after cleanliness measures in urban areas and gram panchayats in villages. Following MCM’s formation, the panchayat system was immediately abolished while the HSIIDC ceased several operations, including cleaning of urban areas in Manesar.“The number of sanitation workers has been increased to improve the sanitation system in MCM area. Senior sanitary inspectors concerned and sanitary inspectors were instructed to lift the garbage in the municipal areas and ensure the appointment of cleaning staff as per requirement. Work is being done, keeping cleanliness on priority, and wherever there is garbage, it is being lifted and the main roads are being cleaned with sweeping machines,” said Hariom Attri, joint commissioner, MCM.Attri said that the MCM is also carrying out a survey to determine the exact number of sanitation workers needed for providing comprehensive coverage across Manesar and subsequently, it may hire more workers on a contractual basis, if required.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gurugram-manesar-civic-bodies-to-increase-sanitation-staff-strength-101618162355343.html
12-04-2021||Mumbai||Sachin Vaze’s colleague Riyazuddin Kazi arrested, in NIA custody till April 16||The National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Sunday arrested Mumbai Police’s assistant police inspector Riyazuddin Kazi over the alleged conspiracy related to the planting of an explosives-laden car outside the residence of industrialist Mukesh Ambani, and the subsequent death of businessman Mansukh Hiran, people familiar with the developments said.Kazi, who was posted in the Crime Intelligence Unit (CIU) along with tainted officer Sachin Vaze, said to be the mastermind in both cases, was aware of Vaze’s plans and “actively” took part in the destruction of evidence after the crimes, an officer said on condition of anonymity.He was arrested around 12.30am on Sunday after hours of questioning and produced before a special court during the day, which remanded him to NIA custody till April 16.Kazi was shifted out of the Mumbai Crime Branch unit last month after NIA arrested Vaze on March 13 for allegedly devising the entire plan to regain his lost glory in the Mumbai Police, as first reported by HT. The agency also took over investigations into the murder of Hiran, saying it was a “connected” offence and that Vaze killed the auto spare parts dealer after he refused to take the blame for the explosives-laden vehicle.Read more: Sachin Vaze’s Shiv Sena connectionA second officer said Kazi destroyed vital evidence related to the case such as a fake vehicle registration plate and the digital video recorder (DVR) of the housing society where Vaze lives. He was also seen at several garages where he got fake registration plates made and later confiscated the DVRs from all the garages and destroyed them, the officer added.NIA earlier questioned Kazi for several days to join the dots in the probe. “He was also reportedly part of the meetings where the alleged conspiracy to kill Hiran was hatched, but this aspect is being further investigated,” the second officer said on condition of anonymity.While seeking Kazi’s custody, special public prosecutor Sunil Gonsalves argued before the court: “Kazi was working as assistant police inspector in the crime intelligence unit (CIU) and was well aware about the crime. He was also aware of the design and things that transpired after the case was transferred to NIA. Hence, the accused started destroying evidence like CPU and DVR.”NIA said it needed to confront the accused with every recovered article, document and witness. “Vaze has given half the facts and we need to question Kazi,” Gonsalves said.Defence lawyer Hasnain Kazi said: “Sachin Vaze was made the investigating officer (IO) in the case. As Qazi was in the same unit hence he was assisting him. The main accused was involved in destroying the evidence and Kazi was present there on the instructions of Vaze. Qazi was going to NIA office from last 20 days for investigation.”In a related development, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) questioned former Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh’s personal secretary Sanjeev Palande and personal assistant Kundan Shinde to establish whether the allegations that Deshmukh asked Vaze to collect ₹100 crore every month from hotels, bars and restaurants were true. The allegations have been levelled by former Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh.Singh said in his letter to Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray that Palande was present when Deshmukh allegedly asked Vaze to extort money from the businesses.Singh and a few other senior police officers from Mumbai have already been questioned by CBI since Friday, while NIA has also shared relevant case documents to assist the agency in its probe.CBI has been asked by the Supreme Court to finish its preliminary enquiry within 15 days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/sachin-vaze-s-colleague-riyazuddin-kazi-arrested-in-nia-custody-till-april-16-101618151432424.html

12-04-2021||World||Judge refuses to isolate jury in George Floyd murder case||The judge in the George Floyd murder case refused a defense request to immediately sequester the jury Monday, the morning after the killing of a Black man during a traffic stop triggered unrest in a suburb just outside Minneapolis.The request came from the attorney for former Minneapolis police Officer Derek Chauvin. Defense attorney Eric Nelson argued that the jurors could be influenced by the prospect of what might happen as a result of their verdict.“Ultimately, your honor, the question becomes will the jury be competent to make a decision regardless of the potential outcome of their decision," Nelson said.Judge Peter Cahill said he will not sequester the jury until next Monday, when he anticipates closing arguments will begin. He also denied a defense request to question jurors about what they might have seen about unrest following Sunday’s police shooting of 20-year-old Daunte Wright in Brooklyn Center.In the wake of the shooting, hundreds of protesters broke into about 20 businesses at a shopping center, jumped on police cars and hurled rocks and other objects at officers in Brooklyn Center, about 10 miles from the heavily fortified Minneapolis courthouse. Police in riot gear fired gas and flash-bang grenades.The Brooklyn Center police chief later called the shooting accidental, saying the officer who fired meant to draw a Taser, not a handgun.Prosecutor Steve Schleicher argued against sequestering the Chauvin jury, saying: “I don’t think that would be an effective remedy.” He also opposed questioning the jurors.“World events happen,” Schleicher said. "And we can’t have every single world event that might affect somebody’s attitude or emotional state or anything be the grounds to come back and re-voir dire all the jurors.”The judge previously told the jury to avoid the news during the trial.The ruling came as the trial entered its third week, with the prosecution close to wrapping up its case and giving way to the start of the defense. Prosecutors built their case on searing witness accounts, experts condemning Chauvin's use of a neck restraint, and medical authorities attributing Floyd's death to a lack of oxygen.When testimony resumed Monday morning, Dr. Jonathan Rich, a cardiology expert from Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago, echoed earlier witnesses in saying Floyd died of low oxygen levels from the way he was held down by police.He rejected defense theories that Floyd died of a drug overdose or a heart condition. Floyd had fentanyl and methamphetamine in his system and had high blood pressure and narrowing of the heart arteries, according to previous testimony.“It was the truly the prone restraint and positional restraints that led to his asphyxiation,” Rich said.In fact, the expert said, "Every indicator is that Mr. Floyd had actually an exceptionally strong heart.”Rich said he had reviewed Floyd’s autopsy report. He said that some narrowing of the arteries is extremely common, and that Floyd had a mildly thickened or mildly enlarged heart but that that would be normal in someone with high blood pressure.Corroborating other experts' testimony, Rich said that Floyd was “restrained in a life-threatening manner,” noting among other things that he was facedown on the ground, a knee was on his neck, his hands were cuffed behind his back and being pushed upward, and a knee was on the lower half of his body.Rich said that as one officer noted on video that Floyd was passing out, police probably still could have saved his life if they had repositioned him so that his lungs could expand again. And once an officer noted that Floyd's pulse had stopped, police still had a significant opportunity to save his life by administering CPR, he said.On cross-examination, Nelson tried to shift blame onto Floyd for struggling with police when they tried to put him in their car. The defense attorney asked Rich if Floyd would have survived if he had “simply gotten in the back seat of the squad car."But Rich quickly reiterated the death was caused by the officers' actions: “Had he not been restrained in the way in which he was, I think he would have survived that day. I think he would have gone home, or wherever he was going to go.”Nelson responded: “So, in other words, if he had gotten in the squad car, he’d be alive.”Derek Chauvin, 45, who is white, is charged with murder and manslaughter in Floyd’s May 25 death. Police had been called to a neighborhood market where Floyd was accused of trying to pass a counterfeit bill.Prosecutors say Chauvin had his knee on Floyd's neck as the 46-year-old Black man lay pinned to the pavement for 9 1/2 minutes. Bystander video of Floyd crying “I can't breathe!” until he finally went limp sparked protests and scattered violence in Minneapolis and around the U.S.Chauvin's attorney is expected to call his own medical experts to make the case that it was not the officer's knee that killed Floyd. The defense has not said whether Chauvin will testify.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/judge-refuses-to-isolate-jury-in-george-floyd-murder-case-101618249551129.html
12-04-2021||World||White House says US not involved in Iran nuclear site incident||The White House on Monday said it was not involved in a power outage incident at an Iranian nuclear site and declined comment on Tehran's accusing Israel of sabotaging the Natanz facility."The US was not involved in any manner," White House press secretary Jen Psaki said in response to questions. "We have nothing to add on speculation about the causes or the impacts."Iran vowed revenge for what it described as an act of "nuclear terrorism" that caused an electricity outage in one of the production halls at the uranium enrichment plant.Israel fiercely opposes Tehran's 2015 nuclear deal with major powers, an accord that Iran and the new administration of President Joe Biden are engaged in trying to revive after then-US President Donald Trump abandoned it three years ago.Multiple Israeli media outlets quoted unnamed intelligence sources as saying Israel's Mossad spy service carried out a successful sabotage operation at the underground complex.Israel, whose existence Iran does not recognize, has not formally commented on the incident.Iran and the global powers described as "constructive" talks last week to salvage the nuclear deal, which has unraveled as Iran has breached its limits on sensitive uranium enrichment since Trump reimposed harsh sanctions on Tehran.Talks are expected to resume on Wednesday in Vienna, and Psaki said she expected them to be "difficult and long.""We have not been given any indication about a change in participation," by Iran, she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/white-house-says-us-not-involved-in-iran-nuclear-site-incident-101618249135933.html
12-04-2021||World||Minnesota police say officer who shot Black man meant to draw Taser, not handgun||The police chief in a Minneapolis suburb where a Black man was fatally shot during a traffic stop said Monday that he believes the officer who fired intended to use a Taser, not a handgun.Brooklyn Center Police Chief Tim Gannon described the shooting as “an accidental discharge.” The state Bureau of Criminal Apprehension was investigating.Daunte Wright, 20, died Sunday in a metropolitan area that was already on edge because of the trial of the first of four police officers charged in George Floyd’s death.Gannon said at a news conference that the officer made a mistake, and he released body camera footage from the officer who fired. The footage showed three officers around a stopped car. When another officer attempts to handcuff Wright, a struggle ensues. The officer is heard shouting “Taser!” several times before firing her weapon.“This was an accidental discharge that resulted in a tragic death of Mr. Wright,” the chief said.Brooklyn Center Mayor Mike Elliott called the shooting “deeply tragic.”“We’re going to do everything we can to ensure that justice is done and our communities are made whole," he said.Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz tweeted that he was praying for Wright’s family “as our state mourns another life of a Black man taken by law enforcement.”Speaking before the unrest, Wright's mother, Katie Wright, urged protesters to stay peaceful and focused on the loss of her son.“All the violence, if it keeps going, it’s only going to be about the violence. We need it to be about why my son got shot for no reason,” she said to a crowd near the shooting scene in Brooklyn Center, a city of about 30,000 people on the northwest border of Minneapolis. “We need to make sure it’s about him and not about smashing police cars, because that’s not going to bring my son back.”Protesters who gathered near the scene waved flags and signs reading “Black Lives Matter.” Others walked peacefully with their hands held up. On one street, someone wrote in multi-colored chalk: “Justice for Daunte Wright.”Katie Wright said her son called her as he was getting pulled over.“All he did was have air fresheners in the car, and they told him to get out of the car,” Wright said. During the call, she said she heard scuffling and then someone saying “Daunte, don’t run” before the call ended. When she called back, her son’s girlfriend answered and said he had been shot.Authorities said the car was pulled over for having expired registration and after determining the driver had an outstanding warrant, police said they tried to arrest him. Then the driver reentered the vehicle, and an officer fired, striking him, police said. The vehicle traveled several blocks before striking another vehicle.Wright’s family offered a different account, with Katie Wright saying her son was shot before getting back into the car.A female passenger sustained non-life-threatening injuries during the crash, authorities said. Katie Wright said that passenger was her son’s girlfriend.Court records show Wright was being sought after failing to appear in court on charges that he fled from officers and possessed a gun without a permit during an encounter with Minneapolis police in June. In that case, a statement of probable cause said police got a call about a man waving a gun who was later identified as Wright.”Shortly after the shooting, demonstrators began to gather, with some jumping atop police cars. Marchers also descended on the Brooklyn Center Police Department, where rocks and other objects were thrown at officers, authorities said. The protesters had largely dispersed by 1:15 a.m. Monday.President Joe Biden was briefed on the shooting, and the White House has been in touch with the governor, mayor and local law enforcement, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said.“We were incredibly saddened to hear about the loss of life at the hands of law enforcement in Minnesota yesterday,” she said.National Guard troops and law enforcement officers continued to guard the front of the police department on Monday morning. Police were erecting a concrete barrier as Minnesota State Patrol officers joined the line in front of the precinct.Several people and reporters watched from across the street as traffic returned to normal on the street where protesters were met with tear gas the night before. One man yelled at the officers using a megaphone as others flew Black Lives Matter flags.About 20 businesses were broken into at the city’s Shingle Creek shopping center, Minnesota Department of Public Safety Commissioner John Harrington said at a news conference.The National Guard was activated, and Brooklyn Center Mayor Mike Elliott announced a curfew that expired shortly before daybreak.Police said Brooklyn Center officers wear body cameras, which they believe were activated during the traffic stop.The trial of Derek Chauvin, the former Minneapolis officer charged in Floyd’s death, continued Monday. Floyd, a Black man, died May 25 after Chauvin, who is white, pressed his knee against Floyd’s neck. Prosecutors say Floyd was pinned for 9 minutes, 29 seconds.More National Guard members and state law enforcement personnel were to be deployed around the Twin Cities and in Brooklyn Center in addition to teams already in place for Chauvin’s trial at the Hennepin County courthouse in Minneapolis, Harrington said.There was no visible increase in the already high security presence on Monday morning outside the courthouse, which was fortified ahead of Chauvin’s trial with tall fencing topped with barbed wire and coils of razor wire between the fences and concrete barriers. National Guard troops with military vehicles, sheriff’s deputies and county security guards continued to stand watch.Meanwhile, all Brooklyn Center students were to attend online classes Monday because school buildings were closed, Superintendent Carly Baker said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/minnesota-police-say-officer-who-shot-black-man-meant-to-draw-taser-not-handgun-101618249259596.html

The transaction is all-cash and the sum includes Nuance's net debt.Nuance's technology is currently used by more than 55 percent of physicians and 75 percent of radiologists in the United States. Microsoft said the deal would double its potential healthcare market to nearly $500 billion."AI is technology's most important priority, and healthcare is its most urgent application," Microsoft Chief Executive Satya Nadella said."Together, with our partner ecosystem, we will put advanced AI solutions into the hands of professionals everywhere to drive better decision-making and create more meaningful connections, as we accelerate growth of Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare and Nuance."This acquisition builds on the existing partnership between the two companies, which have been collaborating since 2019 in telemedicine, a sector whose growth has been spurred exponentially by Covid-19 lockdowns around the world.Last year, the Redmond, Washington-based giant integrated Nuance Communication's Dragon Ambient eXperience program into its Teams communications software, which enables remote transcription of medical conversations.Nuance CEO Mark Benjamin noted the increasing demand for its products in recent years."To seize this opportunity, we need the right platform to bring focus and global scale to our customers and partners to enable more personal, affordable and effective connections to people and care," Benjamin said in the statement. "The path forward is clearly with Microsoft."'No brainer'The deal comes on the heels of Microsoft's 2016 purchase of LinkedIn for $27 billion and represents "the latest step in Microsoft's industry-specific cloud strategy," the company said.Like other technology heavyweights, Microsoft has been a big beneficiary of the economic dislocations during Covid-19.The company's earnings jumped by 33 percent in the latest quarter to $15.5 billion and included a boost from cloud computing and personal computing, including its Xbox video games.Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives called the Nuance tie-up a "trophy" deal for the company founded by Bill Gates, which is on a "strategic offensive" in search of targets to purchase."For Nadella & Co, this is the right acquisition at the right time with Microsoft doubling down on its healthcare initiatives over the coming years," he said in an analysis. "The Nuance deal is a strategic no brainer in our opinion for MSFT and fits like a glove into its healthcare endeavors."Based in Burlington near Boston, Nuance was founded in 1992 and specializes in conversational artificial intelligence solutions, particularly in the healthcare sector.Nuance Communications, which employed more than 7,100 people as of September 30, reported sales of $1.48 billion last year.Benjamin, will remain at the head of the new group, the statement said. He will report to Microsoft's executive vice president of cloud and artificial intelligence, Scott Guthrie.Ives said Microsoft is on the hunt for more acquisitions and this deal "could be the first step in an increased appetite for deals in 2021 with Discord (video game chat community) another potential trophy for Redmond."It comes just a few months after the takeover of ZeniMax, the parent company of video game publisher Bethesda Softworks, for $7.5 billion in September.Media reports cite the potential for other big deals, including crafting platform Pinterest in a possible $51 billion transaction, and the popular Discord discussion platform for about $10 billion.Shares of Nuance surged 17 percent to $53.35 in midday trading, while Microsoft edged up 0.3 percent to $256.68.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/microsoft-to-acquire-ai-cloud-computing-company-nuance-for-19-7-billion-101618245863031.html

But we have many reasons for optimism. The decline in cases and deaths during the first two months of the year shows that this virus and its variants can be stopped," he added.Transmission was being driven by "confusion, complacency and inconsistency in public health measures."India has overtaken Brazil to become the nation with the second highest number of infections worldwide after the United States, as it battles a massive second wave, having given about 105 million vaccine doses among a population of 1.4 billion."We are at a critical point in the pandemic now, the trajectory of this pandemic is growing for the 7th week in a row," said the WHO team leader on Covid-19, Maria van Kerkhove.Noting that there had been a 9% rise in cases last week, the seventh consecutive week of increases, and a 5% rise in deaths, she added: "If you look at the epi (epidemic) curve and the trajectory of the pandemic right now, it is growing exponentially".Tedros said that in some countries, despite continuing transmission, restaurants and nightclubs were full and markets were open and crowded with few people taking precautions."Some people appear to be taking the approach that if they’re relatively young, it doesn’t matter if they get Covid-19," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-pandemic-long-way-from-over-who-chief-tedros-adhanom-ghebreyesus-101618246019658.html

The firm will also need to cut the outstanding value of its money-market fund Yu’ebao.The directives come as China’s regulators pledge to curb the “reckless” push of technology firms into finance and crack down on monopolies online. The twin pillars of Ma’s empire -- Ant and e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. -- have been at the center of the increased scrutiny, sending a clear message to the country’s largest corporations and their leaders to fall in line with Beijing’s priorities.Several government agencies, including the People’s Bank of China, and regulators overseeing the banking and securities sectors met with Ant to dictate the changes.Regulators also slapped a record $2.8 billion fine on Alibaba this month after an anti-trust probe found the e-commerce company abused its market dominance.“The darkest hour for Alibaba has passed, but I wouldn’t say so for Ant Group,” said Dong Ximiao, chief researcher at Zhongguancun Internet Finance Institute. “The latest announcement clarified the framework for Ant’s restructuring, but the tone is still harsh and some of the requirements are tougher than expected. I don’t think the overhang is removed for Ant investors at this stage.”While the revamp leaves Ant’s main businesses intact, regulators are making its harder for the firm to exploit synergies that allowed it to direct traffic from its payments service Alipay -- which has a billion users -- to other financial services including wealth management, consumer lending and even on-demand neighborhood services and delivery.Authorities will now require Ant to cut off any improper linking of payments with other financial products including its Jiebei and Huabei lending services. In a statement, Ant said it would fold those units into its consumer finance arm, apply for a license for personal credit reporting, and improve consumer data protection.“Ant’s growth prospects just became a lot more challenging, given it will be much more difficult to capitalize on its scale,” said Mark Tanner, founder of Shanghai-based consultant China Skinny. “These growth challenges, in addition to the wider concerns about the tech sector regulators, makes their IPO value and attractiveness a shadow of what it was.”Ant Chairman Eric Jing promised staff last month that the company would eventually go public. Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Francis Chan has estimated the firm’s valuation may drop about 60% from the $280 billion it was pegged at last year given the rule changes being contemplated in areas including payments.Payments focusChanges to its payments business were among the top priorities outlined by regulators on Monday, with Ant pledging to return the business “to its origin” by focusing on micro-payments and convenience for users.Earlier this year, China proposed measures to curb market concentration in online payments, which Ant and rival Tencent Holdings Ltd. have transformed with their ubiquitous mobile apps that are used by a combined 1 billion people.The central bank said in draft rules that any non-bank payment company with half of the market in online transactions or two entities with a combined two-thirds share could be subject to antitrust probes.If a monopoly is confirmed, the central bank can suggest that cabinet impose restrictive measures including breaking up the entity by its business type.Mobile payments are only part of what contribute to online transactions, but they have become the most important platform in China, fueling growth in other financial services.Investors are also awaiting final rules aimed at curbing online consumer lending, that were unveiled late last year.Given all the changes still down the track, an Ant IPO remains “far, far away,” said Zhongguancun Internet Finance Institute’s Dong.“What we have now is a clear roadmap for Ant to restructure its sprawling businesses, and what’s certain is that if it revives the IPO in the future, it will be a listing of the entire financial holding company,” said Chen Shujin, Hong Kong-based head of financial research at Jefferies Financial Group Inc.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-forces-jack-ma-s-ant-group-to-transform-into-a-financial-holding-firm-101618245289221.html

The SII did not respond to a request for comment. Botswana's health ministry did not say how the people died.Millions of doses of the AstraZeneca shot have been safely administered around the world.But Europe's drug regulator said last week it had found a possible link between AstraZeneca's vaccine and very rare cases of blood clots.The European Medicines Agency received reports of 169 cases of the rare brain blood clot by early April, after 34 million doses had been administered. Most of the cases reported had occurred in women under 60.The Botswana health ministry said in a statement late on Sunday that the two deaths were of elderly people. It did not elaborate."The ministry has referred the matter to the regulator being BOMRA for immediate investigation. It is expected that BOMRA investigation will seek to establish the cause of two deaths as well as whether they are in any way linked to the Covid vaccine which was administered," the statement read.It advised the public to remain calm and said people who were recovering from recent severe illness should consider delaying getting the vaccine.Experts say that, even if a causal link is proved between the vaccine and blood clots, the risks of getting a serious clot are minute compared to the risks from possible Covid-19 infection, which can cause similar clots along with other serious symptoms.Botswana has recorded around 40,000 coronavirus cases and 630 deaths during the pandemic, few by comparison with many other countries around the world, but its diamond-driven economy was hit hard last year, contracting almost 8%.AstraZeneca's vaccine is the cheapest and most readily available. It does not need to be kept at extremely cold temperatures, making it a mainstay of many vaccination programmes in developing countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/botswana-probes-deaths-of-two-people-who-took-astrazeneca-shot-101618244214546.html

The training is expected to last a few weeks, he said.The Bidens also have a second German shepherd, 12-year-old Champ, at the White House. But it is the younger canine who has been the source of angst since both dogs were relocated to the White House in January from the Bidens' home in Delaware.Last month, the White House confirmed that Major had nipped someone during a walk. Shortly before that incident, Major caused what the White House said was a minor injury to a Secret Service employee on March 8.Both dogs spent time back in Delaware after the first incident — the White House said it was because the first lady would be traveling for a few days — and the president had said Major was being trained.On National Pet Day on Sunday, Jill Biden tweeted photos of both dogs captioned, “Love these two!”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-s-dog-major-gets-help-adjusting-to-white-house-after-two-biting-incidents-101618241671362.html

The incident occurred just 10 miles (16 kilometres) from a courtroom in nearby Minneapolis where a former police officer is on trial for killing George Floyd, which had led to anti-race protests and marches around the world in 2020.Police fired rubber bullets and used tear gas as the crowd lobbed water bottles and garbage bags at the police as they faced off outside the police headquarters in Brooklyn Center, a city near Minneapolis, where the shooting took place. Protesters waved ‘Black Lives Matter’ flags, blasted music and chanted slogans directed at the police, according to reports.StarTribune, a local news publication, reported National Guard troops arrived at the scene of the protests just before midnight as looters targeted a Walmart store and a shopping mall. Looting had spread to other areas as authorities imposed a night-time curfew till 6am.The victim has been identified as Daunte Wright, 20. “Our entire community is filled with grief following today’s officer-involved shooting of Daunte Wright, a 20-year-old young man. Our hearts are with his family, and with all those in our community impacted by this tragedy,” said Brooklyn Center Mayor Mike Elliott on Twitter. “While we await additional information from the BCA (Bureau of Criminal Apprehension) who is leading the investigation, we continue to ask that members of our community gathering do so peacefully, amid our calls for transparency and accountability.”Brooklyn Center police department said that officers had stopped a man for traffic violation on Sunday afternoon. They determined there was an outstanding warrant for his arrest. But when officers tried to take him into custody, he got back into the car.At this time one of the officers, who has not been identified, shot at the driver. The man drove away nevertheless and crashed into another vehicle several blocks away. He was pronounced dead at the scene and a female passenger in the car is reported to have suffered life-threatening injuries.Brooklyn Center police chief Tim Gannon of Brooklyn Center Police Department told reporters at a news conference on Monday that he believes the officer intended to draw the taser to use on Wright but pulled the handgun instead. “This appears to me, from what I viewed, and the officer’s reaction in distress immediately after, that this was an accidental discharge.” The police played a video of the shooting from the body cam of one of the officers.Earlier, Wright’s mother, Katie Wright, told reporters, “All he did was have air fresheners in the car and they told him to get out of the car.”StarTribune reported the victim had called his mother when he was pulled over. “He got out of the car, and his girlfriend said they shot him,” she said. “He got back into the car, and he drove away and crashed and now he’s dead on the ground since 1.47pm. ... Nobody will tell us anything. Nobody will talk to us. ... I said please take my son off the ground.”The Sunday shooting took place just hours before a court was to resume proceedings in the trial of Derek Chauvin, the former Minneapolis police officer, for the death of George Floyd, a 46-year-old African-American man, in May 2020, which had sparked anti-race protests in the US and around the world.Prosecution is wrapping up its case in which it deposed police officers, legal and medical experts and witnesses in proceedings that were aired live by many news channels.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/protests-in-minnesota-after-police-shoot-black-man-101618240957791.html

Located at over 17,000 feet (5,182 metres), the Ganbala radar station was built in the 1960s and is strategically located in the Yadong county of Xigase prefecture in the Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR); it is located close to both Sikkim and Bhutan.The purpose of the new 5G station is primarily to help the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) soldiers posted at the remote station to access the internet and keep in contact with family.“Recently, a 5G signal base station was put into use at the Ganbala radar station in Tibet at the elevation of 5,182 metres, the world’s highest manually operated radar station,” the official defence portal, China Military Online reported on Monday.The report added that “information blockade” was adding to the “exceptionally challenging” living conditions at the radar station including the lack of potable water, accommodation, and heating.The PLA started to coordinate with civilian enterprises to launch 5G base station construction in Ganbala last year to solve the difficulty of network access for the border troops.“The stable and high-speed 5G signal enables soldiers in the deep mountains to keep up with the information society, leaving the monotonous and boring life on the border behind forever,” the report added.The operationalisation of 5G signal base station has “…shortened the distance between soldiers and their families and friends”.Radar operator Lin Linghui told the website said that serving in the military on plateau areas means that he could not get together with family members often, but he could now have video chat with his family freely and witness the growth of his child.Clearly, the launch of 5G signals at a height of over 17,000 feet in the mountains is part of China’s continuing efforts to improve living conditions and infrastructure in the strategic area for PLA troops.In recent years, the Chinese military has continued to advance various projects to improve the conditions of its border troops, including green vegetables supply all year round, warm, and clean barracks, and ready-to-use oxygen inhalers.“The implementation of these measures has supported the improvement of training and on-duty conditions for soldiers stationed in border areas,” the military website said.Since last May, climbers to Mt Everest from the Chinese side have been able to use 5G coverage after the world’s highest-altitude base station started operating on the mountain.Built at an altitude of 6,500 metres, the base station is located at the advance base camp of Mt Everest, the world’s highest peak||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-operationalises-5g-services-at-tibet-radar-station-101618236037768.html

12-04-2021||World||Sputnik vaccine helping Russia regain foothold in Latin America||Russia has been trying to get its coronavirus vaccine Sputnik V into Brazilian arms for months, and been repeatedly frustrated by legal, regulatory and possibly even diplomatic obstacles.That began to change as the South American nation played catch-up in the global race to snap up shots. Receiving little help from the US, which was struggling to get a handle on its own outbreak, Sputnik V seemed as good as any; Brazil's federal government and a group of nine northeastern states signed two deals with Russia's sovereign wealth fund, RDIF, for a total 47 million doses. The shot is moving toward regulatory approval.The vaccine has now been purchased by at least nine Latin American nations, with Brazil its greatest uphill battle.That growing adoption reflects Russia gaining a greater foothold in the region the US has traditionally viewed as within its sphere of influence — and where the American government had boasted of steering Brazil away from Russian vaccines. It's similar to China's success in achieving wide use of its own vaccines in Latin America.That has caused consternation in US diplomatic circles, although it remains to be seen if Russia’s vaccine outreach will yield deeper partnerships.Tom Shannon, a former undersecretary of state whose long diplomatic career included several stints in the region, told The Associated Press the US has largely missed an opportunity to engage with Latin American governments during the pandemic, with the exception of a recently announced plan by President Joe Biden’s administration to provide Mexico surplus shots“For the Kremlin, Covid was a godsend,” Shannon said of Russia’s vaccine outreach. “This was a chance for them to restart their diplomacy in the hemisphere with a whole new face of public health intervention and they are taking full advantage of it.”“When you have 300,000 dead, you take the help where you can get it from,” he said of Brazil.Russia’s presence in Latin America has been limited since the 1990s, and in recent years primarily entailed an alliance with Venezuela for provision of arms and energy projects, as well as Nicaragua for arms and building emergency response capabilities. But Latin America's arms purchases plunged as its commodities boom ended and Venezuela economy melted down.Russian ties were also strong with the government of Argentina’s Cristina Fernandez Kirchner from 2007 to 2015 and appear to be reviving. As current vice president, Kirchner spearheaded negotiations to buy Sputnik V even when local scientists initially were skeptical of the early experimental data reported by the Gamaleya Institute that developed the vaccine.Argentina's embrace of the vaccine helped convince Mexico — which had struggled to get vaccines from US companies — to sign an agreement for 24 million doses, though they have been slow to arrive.Bolivia’s previously tight relations with Russia had reversed under President Luis Arce’s right-wing predecessor, but Arce, who took office in November, agreed to buy millions of doses. After speaking with Putin by phone, he also announced reactivation of a Russian-led project to build a nuclear research and technology centre.US vaccine outreach, meantime, has been almost entirely indirect, with a pledge of $4 billion to the World Health Organization’s COVAX program to provide shots to low- and middle-income countries. Recently, such shipments have been delayed.The US has snatched up more doses than it will eventually need, and Biden has repeatedly said his focus is vaccinating all Americans before sharing vaccines abroad. The US has had almost three times as many Covid-19 deaths per capita as Russia and, even with one of the world's fastest immunization rollouts, Americans have complained about the pace.By contrast, Russia’s own vaccination program has lagged because of widespread skepticism of the vaccine — a February poll showed only 30% of Russians were willing to get the shot — and drug makers being slow to ramp up production.Only recently did Biden's administration agree to provide 2.7 million surplus AstraZeneca doses to Mexico. Brazil has been trying to negotiate the same for itself, according to its foreign ministry.“Although I truly think that the US and European countries are the preferred partners in the region, if there is a vacuum, there isn’t the slightest doubt that China and Russia will seek a way to take advantage,” Mauricio Claver-Carone, the head of the Inter-American Development Bank, told the AP.The US Department of Health and Human Services’ 2020 annual report said in a section titled “Combatting malign influences in the Americas” that it had convinced Brazil to not to buy the Russian shot. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said March 16 other countries faced similar coercion, without naming them.“The pressure has been unprecedented, tough and devoid of any diplomatic niceties,” Peskov said. “We are categorically against politicizing the situation with vaccines.”Fabiano Mielniczuk, a professor who specializes in Russian international politics at Brazil’s Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, said suspicion of Russia represents an outdated Cold War mentality, and sees its moves to introduce the shot “much more as market-oriented action than as geopolitical action.”Despite the assertion in the “malign influences” section, it's unclear what action the US took. The US embassy denied exerting any pressure regarding vaccines approved by Brazil’s health regulator, which has not yet signed off on Sputnik V. Brazil’s government denied even being consulted.Frustrated by the speed and bureaucracy of health regulator Anvisa, the Russians conducted phase 3 trials of its vaccine elsewhere, according to Bahia state’s Gov. Rui Costa, who had worked closely with the fund. At the time, Brazil still required local phase 3 trials for regulatory approval.In a last-ditch effort, RDIF’s director Kirill Dmitriev reached out to former President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, according to Alexandre Padilha, a lawmaker and former health minister who joined their subsequent meeting. That led to the nine states' eventual deal for 37 million doses. RDIF declined to comment for this story.“The northeastern governments already have various investment partnerships with the Chinese,” Padilha said. “I think without a doubt this can open doors for northeast governors to establish other partnerships and technology investments with the Russians.”Putin meantime heaped flattery on Bolsonaro at a multinational summit in November, saying the Brazilian had “expressed the best qualities of masculinity and determination” by putting citizens’ interests before his own health. Bolsonaro posted video of the praise to social media.Courting the rival former and current presidents simultaneously reflects Putin’s pragmatism, said Mielniczuk, the political science professor.Brazil’s federal government agreed to buy 10 million doses.Even after Anvisa dropped its demand for local phase 3 trials, the Brazilian lab that would produce Sputnik V locally — Uniao Quimica — struggled to clear hurdles.RDIF’s Dmitriev told Brazilian magazine Veja in mid-March that he felt his vaccine was still facing political bias. But Anvisa said delays were technical, caused by lacking documentation, and on March 23 it held a five-hour meeting with Uniao Quimica and Gamaleya to iron out problems. A week later, Anvisa certified Uniao Quimica’s manufacturing practices.On April 6, Bolsonaro spoke with Putin by video call and said afterward that his government was working to resolve "some obstacles″ to importing the shot. The leaders also discussed broader trade, defense industry cooperation and technology.After the call was first reported, the former director of Brazil's trade and investment promotion agency, Márcio Coimbra, said on Twitter, “Now distant from Washington, we may be closer than ever to Moscow.”Some documentation is still missing, but Sputnik V is inching closer to approval in Brazil — and another soft-power score for Russia. It serves as a wake-up call, said Eric Farnsworth, who has developed and implemented US policy in the region.“We’re not the only ones that Latin America can interact with and they’re showing it right now,” said Farnsworth, vice president of the Council of the Americas, a New York-based organization promoting business in the region. “There is much ground to be recaptured, and the only way to do that would be to overwhelm the region with generosity in combatting the pandemic.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sputnik-vaccine-helping-russia-regain-foothold-in-latin-america-101618232821569.html

The man died from his wounds."I heard six loud shots while I was having lunch around 1.30 pm (1130 GMT)," the caretaker of a nearby building told AFP."I went out immediately, and I saw a young black man on the ground, face down, outside the hospital. He was maybe 20 or 30 years old and he was already dead," said the caretaker, who declined to give her name.The injured woman works as a security guard at the hospital, which runs a Covid-19 vaccination centre.Paris prosecutors said they were treating the shooting as a murder and an attempted murder.District mayor Francis Szpiner told reporters that the attacker had fired several rounds at the man."It would seem that the security guard was hit by a stray bullet," he said.Szpiner said the shooting was "neither a terrorist attack nor an attack on the vaccination centre".- 'Walked off with amazing calmness' -The owner of a restaurant across the street from the hospital told the BFMTV television channel that he also heard shots ringing out."I turned around and I saw a guy with a hoodie firing.

12-04-2021||World||Alibaba shares rise as it plays down effects of record $2.78 billion fine||Shares in tech giant Alibaba climbed more than six percent Monday as the ecommerce titan reassured investors that a record $2.78 billion antitrust fine imposed by China would have little impact on its operations.However, concerns that officials had not finished with a crackdown on the sector weighed on big-name firms including Tencent and JD.com.Ant Group, whose planned record-shattering $35 billion Hong Kong-Shanghai IPO was shelved late last year amid the Chinese crackdown on Big Tech, separately announced a restructuring plan but vowed to "ensure business continuity".Regulators slapped Alibaba with the penalty on Saturday after a months-long probe concluded it had been abusing its dominant market position.But in a conference call to investors on Monday, Alibaba's board suggested the fine marked the end of the investigation, with chairman Daniel Zhang saying the penalty would not have a "negative impact" on business operations.The government has cracked down on major Chinese tech platforms -- and Alibaba in particular -- over allegations of anti-competitive behaviour, misuse of consumer data and over-aggressive expansions."We had good guidance on some of the specific issues under the anti-monopoly law and I would say that we are pleased that we are able to put this matter behind us," company vice-chair Joe Tsai added.Ant Group said it would comply with government demands that it establish a financial holding company and apply for relevant licences to bring its online lending, credit and wealth management businesses more in line with Chinese banking regulations.Ant's foray into the wider world of financial services has alarmed regulators who are trying to rein in soaring personal debt.Ant Group added that it would "return to its origins (in) our payment business", but gave few details.Alibaba, meanwhile, will introduce measures to lower entry barriers and business costs faced by merchants on its shopping platform.Alibaba's stock price jumped nearly nine percent to as high as HK$237.60 in Hong Kong on Monday morning before easing back marginally to close up 6.5 percent.But other tech firms took a hit with Tencent down one percent, JD.com losing two percent and NetEase one percent lower."Alibaba's stock has rallied as the fine wasn't as bad as it could have been," said OANDA's Jeffrey Halley. "However, it is the thought that counts, and investors seem concerned that Alibaba will not be the last China tech giant in the fine firing line."Alibaba has faced special scrutiny after co-founder Jack Ma publicly criticised Chinese regulators in October over their warnings about Ant Group's expansion."We have continuous communication with the regulators," Zhang said, adding that the group will "fully comply" with the requirements.Alibaba was punished for forbidding merchants who use its popular online marketplaces from simultaneously offering products on rival e-commerce sites, the State Administration for Market Regulation said in announcing the fine Saturday.Lina Choi from Moody's Investors Service warned that the required changes will "likely limit Alibaba's revenue growth" in the future and hinder attempts to grab more market share."Investments to retain merchants and upgrade products and services will also reduce its profit margins," she said.Alibaba and JD.com, along with messaging-and-gaming colossus Tencent, became hugely profitable on the back of growing Chinese digital lifestyles and government restrictions on major US competitors in the domestic market.But their success has drawn the scrutiny of Beijing as the platforms amassed hundreds of millions of regular users.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/alibaba-shares-rise-as-it-plays-down-effects-of-record-2-78-billion-fine-101618229346388.html

Singapore uses robots for home deliveries to cut Covid-19 spread||Hoping to capitalise on a surge in demand for home deliveries, a Singapore technology company has deployed a pair of robots to bring residents their groceries in one part of the city state. Developed by OTSAW Digital and both named "Camello", the robots' services have been offered to 700 households in a one-year trial. Users can book delivery slots for their milk and eggs, and an app notifies them when the robot is about to reach a pick-up point - usually the lobby of an apartment building.The robots, which are equipped with 3D sensors, a camera and two compartments each able to carry up to 20 kg (44 lb) of food or parcels ordered online, make four or five deliveries per day on weekdays and are on call for half day on Saturday. They use ultraviolet light to disinfect themselves after every trip, said OTSAW Digital's chief executive, Ling Ting Ming. "Especially during this pandemic period, everybody is looking at contactless, humanless," he told Reuters. For the time being, staff accompany the robots on their rounds to ensure no problems arise.Tashfique Haider, a 25-year-old student who has tried out the service, said it could be particularly helpful for the elderly so they wouldn't have to carry goods home.

I don't think they (the older generation) will, because these are gadgets that younger people like," said 36-year-old housewife Xue Ya Xin.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-normal-singapore-uses-robots-for-home-deliveries-to-cut-covid-19-spread-101618228376313.html
12-04-2021||World||Russians celebrate 60th anniversary of Yuri Gagarin's spaceflight||Russia on Monday celebrated the 60th anniversary of the legendary flight that made Yuri Gagarin the first man in space, a major source of national pride for millions of his countrymen.Russia's space industry has struggled in recent years and been hit by a series of mishaps, but the sending of the first human into space on April 12, 1961 remains a crowning achievement of the Soviet space programme.President Vladimir Putin was to travel Monday to the southern city of Engels on the banks of the Volga River, to the site of the cosmonaut's landing where a memorial stands to honour the historic flight.He was to be accompanied by Valentina Tereshkova, a Soviet cosmonaut and the first woman in space.The day of Gagarin's flight is celebrated every year in Russia as Cosmonautics Day, and this year authorities are pulling out all the stops to mark the 60th anniversary, with round-the-clock television coverage, murals on high-rises and laser projections of Gagarin's portrait.For Moscow commuters, the morning started with a broadcast on the Metro of the original report by state news agency TASS about the launch, followed by Gagarin's legendary words -- "Poekhali!" (Let's go) -- as his Vostok spacecraft lifted off.In a message from the International Space Station, the four Russians on board saluted "all earthlings" and hailed Gagarin's accomplishment."Gagarin's legendary 108-minute flight became an example of heroism for his successors, including us," said cosmonaut Oleg Novitsky.Vostok took off carrying the 27-year-old son of a carpenter and a dairy farmer from the Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, then part of the Soviet Union.The flight lasted just 108 minutes, the time it took to complete one loop around the Earth.Gagarin landed in a potato field in front of a five-year-old girl, Rita Nurskanova, and her grandmother.In an interview with newspaper Moskovsky Komsomolets for the anniversary, Nurskanova said that after seeing a flash of light and a spacesuit, her grandmother started to pray and wanted to run.Gagarin calmed them down, saying he was human and "came from the sky," she said. Then her grandmother helped him unfasten his helmet.'Name that everyone knows'Gagarin's now-rusty Vostok capsule is on display at Moscow's Museum of Cosmonautics where a new exhibition dedicated to his achievement is set to open on Tuesday.Visitors will be shown documents, photos and personal belongings, some dating back to Gagarin's childhood and school years."This is probably the only surname that everyone knows, from four-year-old children to people over 80," Vyacheslav Klimentov, a historian and the museum's deputy director of research, told AFP.Gagarin's flight remains a symbol of the country's dominance in space during the Soviet era. Four years before Gagarin, the USSR had become the first country to send a satellite into orbit, called Sputnik.But the anniversary also comes at a difficult time for Russia's space industry, which has suffered a number of setbacks in recent years, from corruption scandals to lost spacecraft to an aborted take-off during a manned mission in 2018.Russia's ageing Soyuz rockets are reliable and allow Moscow to remain relevant in the modern space industry, but the country is struggling to innovate and keep up with other key players.In a major blow, Russia last year lost its monopoly for manned ISS launches after reusable rockets from Elon Musk's Space X, carrying NASA astronauts, successfully docked at the space station.In a video message on Monday, the head of Russia's Roscosmos space agency, Dmitry Rogozin, stressed that the USSR sent a man into space despite having lost "colossal resources" during World War II.Rogozin has set a series of ambitious goals for Roscosmos in recent years despite funding cuts to the space programme.He said that Russia was "on the cusp of very important changes" that will see next-generation spacecraft and lunar missions."We believe in our space, in Russian space," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russians-celebrate-60th-anniversary-of-yuri-gagarin-s-spaceflight-101618227782073.html
12-04-2021||World||Syrian air force may have dropped chlorine bomb on town in rebel area in 2018: Chemical arms watchdog||The global chemical weapons watchdog has "reasonable grounds to believe" that Syria's air force dropped a chlorine bomb on a residential neighbourhood in the rebel-controlled Idlib region in February 2018, a report released on Monday said.There was no immediate comment from the Syrian government. Syria and its military ally Russia have consistently denied using chemical weapons during President Bashar al-Assad's decade-old conflict with rebel forces, saying any such attacks were staged by opponents to make Damascus look like the culprit.The new report by the OPCW chemical weapons watchdog's investigative arm said no one was killed when the cylinder of chlorine gas, delivered in a barrel bomb, hit the Al Talil neighbourhood in the city of Saraqib in February 2018.However, a dozen people were treated for symptoms consistent with chemical poisoning, including nausea, eye irritation, shortness of breath, coughing and wheezing, it said.Chlorine is not an internationally banned toxin, but the use of any chemical substance in armed conflict is banned under the 1997 Chemical Weapons Convention, the implementation of which is overseen by the OPCW watchdog based in The Hague.A crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators by Assad in 2011 mushroomed into civil war, with Russia and Iran supporting his government and the United States, Turkey and some Arab adversaries of Damascus backing some of the many rebel groups.In April 2020, the OPCW's Investigation and Identification Team (IIT) concluded that Syrian warplanes and a helicopter had dropped bombs containing chlorine and sarin nerve gas on a village in Syria's Hama region in March 2017.The latest report by the IIT also implicated Syrian government forces. It concluded that "there were reasonable grounds to believe that at least one cylinder filled with chlorine was dropped from a helicopter of the Syrian Arab Air Forces, belonging to the Tiger Forces."The Tiger Forces are an elite Syrian military unit generally used in offensive operations in the war, which has largely subsided with Assad having wrested back most territory with crucial Russian and Iranian support."All elements indicated the presence of Tiger Forces in the vicinity of Saraqib. They found that a helicopter was just flying above the bombed area at the moment of the gas release," a summary of the OPCW report said.It said that samples collected from the scene were examined and other possible means of chlorine contamination considered, but the OPCW team said nothing was found to indicate that the incident was staged by Assad's adversaries.The team identified individuals believed to be involved in the alleged attack but did not release them.Between 2015 and 2017, a joint United Nations-OPCW team known as the Joint Investigative Mechanism (JIM) found that Syrian government troops had used the nerve agent sarin and chlorine barrel bombs on several occasions, while Islamic State militants were found to have used mustard gas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/syrian-air-force-may-have-dropped-chlorine-bomb-on-town-in-rebel-area-in-2018-chemical-arms-watchdog-101618226774335.html
12-04-2021||World||China mulls mixing Covid-19 vaccines to boost efficacy: Official||China’s top disease control official has said Beijing is considering missing Covid-19 vaccines to boost efficacy as the country expands its inoculation programme.Gao Fu, the director of Chinese Centre of Disease Control (CDC) has said that mixing doses is one way to boost efficacy as vaccines “don’t have very high rates of protection”.“Inoculation using vaccines of different technical lines is being considered,” Gao was quoted as saying in agency reports at a conference in the city of Chengdu.Following reports that interpreted Gao’s statement as an admission of the lack of vaccine efficacy, the top expert appeared to backtrack.Gao told Global Times that “…protection rates of all vaccines in the world are sometimes high, and sometimes low”. “How to improve their efficacy is a question that needs to be considered by scientists around the world,” he said.“In this regard, I suggest that we can consider adjusting the vaccination process, such as the number of doses and intervals and adopting sequential vaccination with different types of vaccines,” Gao added.China has developed four domestic vaccines, which are approved for public use; a fifth is being used for smaller-scale emergency inoculation.The country will likely produce 3 billion doses by the end of the year, a health official said over the weekend.China’s top health authority, the national health commission (NHC) on Sunday also urged local authorities to “…halt mandatory vaccination orders as some cities were reportedly found to adopt compulsory measures to meet the country’s goal of vaccinating 560 million people by June”.Mi Feng, the NHC spokesperson was quoted by state media as saying that “some places adopted inappropriate measures, including a ‘one-size-fits-all’ or ‘compulsory for all’ approach, which needs to be corrected”.In one case, officials from the township of Wancheng in south China’s Hainan province had to revoke a controversial inoculation notice which claimed that people who did not take the shot would be banned from public transport and from entering public venues such as restaurants and supermarkets.Until Saturday, China had administered 164.47 million doses, making it the second-fastest country in the world after the US in terms of inoculation numbers.Beijing has also offered its vaccines around the world, shipping millions of doses abroad. Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand and Pakistan, Brazil, Chile, Ukraine, Zimbabwe, and Tunisia are among the countries, which have ordered Chinese vaccines.“Some nations are relying heavily on Chinese vaccines for their covid-19 vaccination programmes. The majority of those administered by the UAE, for example, are made by Sinopharm. Serbia looks set to receive another 500 000 Sinopharm doses, having already taken delivery of 1.5 million. Cambodia and Egypt have received shipments of 300 000 doses at a time,” the British Medical Journal said in a report last week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-mulls-mixing-covid-19-vaccines-to-boost-efficacy-official-101618226017586.html
12-04-2021||World||Philippines, US begin two-week joint military drill amid tensions in South China Sea||Over the next two weeks, the Philippines armed forces will hold joint exercises with hundreds of US soldiers amid growing tensions with Beijing in the South China Sea.According to Arab News, nearly 1,700 Filipino and American military personnel will take part in the joint exercises.Unlike in previous years, the Balikatan exercises 2021 (BK-21) will not be open to the public as part of safety protocols to limit the spread of coronavirus."The exercises officially start tomorrow and will last for about two weeks," Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Cirilito Sobejana told reporters on Sunday."We will be conducting (the exercises), but it will be different from previous years because of the pandemic. There will be a virtual (portion) of the exercise," he said.The opening ceremonies for BK-21 will be held at the AFP General Headquarters in Camp Aguinaldo, Quezon City on Monday, Sobejana said, adding that 700 American and 1,000 Filipino troops would take part.This year's resumption of the annual BK-21 event, which was called off last year due to the Covid-19 pandemic, follows a phone call between the two countries' defence chiefs on Sunday to "reaffirm their shared commitment to the US-Philippines alliance".In a statement, Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby said that US Secretary of Defence Lloyd Austin III and his Filipino counterpart Delfin Lorenzana "discussed the situation in the South China Sea, and the recent massing of People's Republic of China maritime militia vessels at Juan Felipe (Whitsun) Reef".The defence and foreign affairs ministries in the Philippines have been up in arms for a fortnight over the presence of 220 fishing boats suspected to be manned by Chinese maritime militia at Whitsun Reef, with statements flying back and forth over the alleged incursion into the Philippines' exclusive economic zone.Secretary of Philippines Foreign Affairs Teddy Locsin Jnr said last Wednesday he was "firing off another diplomatic protest" to China's embassy and would continue objecting "every day until the last one's gone like it should be by now if it is really fishing".Even after such an intensifying row, China hasn't shown any sign of relocation of the vessels. Instead, they have accused the Philippines of using a 2016 international tribunal ruling, which deprived China of certain outcrops of territorial-generating status, the ruling from the permanent court of arbitration effectively punches holes in China's all-encompassing "nine-dash" line that stretches deep into the South China Sea, as reported by the Sydney Morning Herald.The 2016 International Tribunal Ruling denies China of its thousand years of fishing rights in the area.Meanwhile, the United States has reminded China of Washington's treaty obligations to the Philippines in the event of an attack in the waters."An armed attack against the Philippines' armed forces, public vessels or aircraft in the Pacific, including in the South China Sea, will trigger our obligations under the US-Philippines Mutual Defence Treaty," State Department spokesman Ned Price told reporters.The Whitsun Reef belongs to the Spratly archipelago, the territory of which is claimed by Brunei, China, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan, and Vietnam.China considers the Spratly archipelago to be its territory, despite the Hague-based Permanent Court of Arbitration ruling, which said there was no legal basis for China's maritime claims. The arbitration proceeding was initiated by the Philippines in January 2013, Sputnik reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/philippines-us-begin-two-week-joint-military-drill-amid-tensions-in-south-china-sea-101618223633827.html
12-04-2021||World||India overtakes Brazil, Bangladesh orders shutdown as surge hits South Asia||India on Monday overtook Brazil as the country with the second-highest number of coronavirus infections and Bangladesh halted international flights and shut offices as a new wave battered South Asia.The region -- home to almost a quarter of the world's population -- has been hit by soaring infection rates in recent weeks.India reported a new daily record of more than 168,000 cases on Monday to take the total toll to 13.5 million cases, above Brazil's 13.48 million.Experts have blamed coronavirus complacency and frustration for the surge.Hundreds of thousands of maskless Hindu devotees thronged the banks of the Ganges River for a ritual bath as part of the Kumbh Mela festival in the holy city of Haridwar.The huge religious festivals and political rallies in poll-bound states have been widely accused as cases grow among the population of 1.3 billion.In neighbouring Bangladesh there was a mad scramble for buses and trains after the government ordered an eight-day closure of all offices and international and domestic transport from Wednesday.Tens of thousands of people flocked to Dhaka's main bus, train and ferry stations to flee the capital ahead of the shutdown.The country of 160 million people has recorded 684,756 cases and 9,739 deaths, but the number of daily cases has increased sevenfold in a month.Hospitals across the nation say they are being overwhelmed by the new cases, and daily deaths have more than doubled."There is no alternative now to this in order to curb the Covid-19 surge," junior minister Farhad Hossain said ahead of the clampdown announcement.Indian authorities have also warned of tougher restrictions unless the public keeps to social distancing and the wearing of masks."The whole country has been complacent -- we allowed social, religious and political congregations," Rajib Dasgupta, a health professor at Jawaharlal Nehru University in Delhi, told AFP.India has recorded more than 873,000 cases in the last seven days -- an increase of 70 percent compared to the previous week, according to data compiled by AFP.In comparison, Brazil recorded about 497,000, about 10 percent higher from the previous week.The United States -- the worst-hit country -- reported just under 490,000 cases with a rising trend of nine percent.The spike in India, after daily rises in cases fell below 9,000 in early February, has seen many badly affected states and territories impose restrictions on movement and activities.India's wealthiest state Maharashtra, which has been the main driver of the infection spike, last week imposed a weekend lockdown and night curfew.- 'No alternative' -But Maharashtra has warned that a complete lockdown -- a drastic measure that national and state governments have tried to avoid to protect the already devastated economy -- could be imposed within the next few days as cases continue to rise."The solution is for everyone to stay home for two months and end this (pandemic) once and for all. But the public doesn't listen," said Rohit, 28, a waiter at a popular Mumbai restaurant who moved to the financial hub for work from the northern state of Punjab."Nobody follows the rules in the restaurant... If we tell customers to wear masks, they are rude and disrespectful to us."The chief minister in New Delhi, where a night curfew is in place, said Sunday that two thirds of new Covid-19 patients were younger than 45.He said the government would consider imposing a lockdown if hospital beds start running out.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-overtakes-brazil-bangladesh-orders-shutdown-as-surge-hits-south-asia-101618220363074.html
12-04-2021||World||Leaders of Merkel's CDU meet to discuss choice of candidate for next chancellor||Senior members of Germany's Christian Democrats met on Monday to discuss whether to back party chairman Armin Laschet as the conservative candidate for chancellor at a September election, or go for Markus Soeder, chief of their Bavarian sister party.Soeder, the Bavarian premier and leader of the Christian Social Union (CSU), put himself forward on Sunday to run as the conservative candidate in September's federal election and said he would settle the question soon and amicably with his rival, Laschet.Pressure is mounting for a swift decision on who should stand for the two-party bloc as the candidate to succeed Chancellor Angela Merkel, who has ruled out standing for a fifth term.Tobias Hans, CDU premier of the tiny western state of Saarland, said ahead of a meeting of the CDU executive committee that he expected the group to back Laschet."It's clear that the CDU Executive Committee stands behind its party leader," Hans said.As the larger partner in the CDU/CSU alliance, the CDU's choice of candidate is likely to be decisive, sources in the alliance say.The CDU's wider federal board meets after the executive committee, or praesidium, and Laschet plans to hold a news conference at around 1 p.m. (1100 GMT). The CSU meets in the afternoon in Munich.The CDU's executive committee in the city state of Berlin, where the party does not hold power, said it backed Soeder."Markus Soeder is the hands-on, successful crisis manager who can lead Germany out of the pandemic and make the country fit for the future," Kai Wegner, chairman of the CDU Berlin, said in a statement.Laschet, 60, is a centrist widely seen as a candidate who would continue Merkel's legacy, but he has clashed with her over coronavirus restrictions. Premier of Germany's most populous state, North Rhine-Westphalia, his chaotic handling of the crisis has undermined his popularity.Soeder, 54, is an astute political operator who has sided with Merkel during the pandemic. No CSU leader has become German chancellor.Many conservatives are nervous about contesting the Sept. 26 federal election without Merkel, who has led them to four victories. She has not explicitly backed either candidate but has hinted that she would back the CDU leader.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/leaders-of-merkel-s-cdu-meet-to-discuss-choice-of-candidate-for-next-chancellor-101618218983756.html
12-04-2021||World||NASA aims to land first woman, person of colour on Moon by 2024 under 'Artemis' mission||The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the US space agency, has said that in addition to landing the first woman on the Moon, it also plans to send the first person of colour to the lunar surface as part of its ambitious international spaceflight programme, 'Artemis'. The mission, endorsed by the Biden-Harris administration, aims to land the astronauts on the lunar south pole by 2024 and and create sustainable missions to the earth’s natural satellite by 2028.The ambitious mission is being regarded as a forward step for diversity. The 'Artemis' program is so named after the Greek goddess of the Moon and the twin sister of Apollo, the inspiration behind Nasa's first moon landing mission. Last year in November, Nasa had introduced the 18 astronauts who will staff the human spaceflight mission. The group includes nine women and several people of colour, but it is not yet known who the actual "first woman" or the "first person of colour" to touch the lunar surface will be. The initial group of Artemis astronauts also includes Indian American Raja Chari.On Friday, the US administration under president Joe Biden and vice-president Kamala Harris submitted 2022 budget priorities to Congress. Nasa's goal to land the first woman and the first person of colour on the Moon under the Artemis programme "aligns with President Biden's commitment to pursue a comprehensive approach to advancing equity for all," said acting Nasa administrator Steve Jurczyk in an official statement."With Nasa's Space Launch System rocket and Orion spacecraft, as well as U.S. commercial partnerships with the human landing system and Gateway lunar outpost, we will send astronauts to the Moon and provide learning opportunities for future missions," Nasa said in its official statement, adding that the Biden-Harris administration's 2022 discretionary funding request "furthers the robotic exploration of the solar system and the universe". According to Nasa, the Artemis programme will serve as a proving ground for the returning astronauts to the Moon, who will later be sent to Mars. The legacy and science advanced during the Apollo programme will be carried forward to a new century for humans to achieve breakthroughs in space exploration that previously seemed impossible, the US space agency said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nasa-aims-to-land-first-woman-person-of-colour-on-moon-by-2024-101618214004696.html
12-04-2021||World||'Behave responsibly': UK PM Boris Johnson appeals as Covid-19 lockdown eases||Prime Minister Boris Johnson urged people to continue to "behave responsibly" as shops, hairdressers, restaurants, pubs and gyms reopen their doors on Monday in the latest stage of the coronavirus lockdown easing in England.People were seen queuing overnight outside some clothing stores and also some pubs and restaurants, which are now allowed to serve customers outdoors. Social mixing indoors remains heavily restricted and people are still expected to work from home where possible to minimise the amount they have to commute."I'm sure it will be a huge relief for those business owners who have been closed for so long, and for everyone else it's a chance to get back to doing some of the things we love and have missed," Johnson said."I urge everyone to continue to behave responsibly and remember 'hands, face, space and fresh air' to suppress COVID as we push on with our vaccination programme," he said.According to some media reports, the UK PM will be among some of the first in line to get his haircut ahead of a special House of Commons session for tributes to the late Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh, who passed away on Friday.Under this stage of the lockdown easing roadmap laid out by the government, public buildings such as libraries and community centres can reopen. Most outdoor attractions including zoos, theme parks, and socially-distanced drive-in performances can reopen.Some smaller outdoor events such as fetes, literary fairs, and fairgrounds can take place; weddings, civil partnership ceremonies, wakes and other commemorative events can take place for up to 15 people.People are not allowed to visit each other's homes and socialising indoors remains prohibited outside of households and support bubbles.The Metropolitan Police also urged people to exercise caution as it prepared to enhance patrols in busy areas of London.“The Met is ready to welcome back people to the streets of London. We will be stepping up our patrols to busy high footfall areas, to look out for everyone’s safety and to disrupt any criminal activity,” said Deputy Assistant Commissioner Jane Connors, the Met Police’s lead for COVID-19 response.“Of course, where we need to take action against those who dangerously flout the rules we will do. While the case rate has declined in London, we have seen the concerning position in northern Europe. It is important that we all stick to the rules so further lockdowns, or restrictions, are avoided,” she said.Businesses have been making extensive preparations for this stage of the lockdown roadmap, including safety glass, queuing systems, social distancing signage, better ventilation, and more frequent cleaning.Monday’s rule changes in England mark the latest easing since the country's third national stay-at-home lockdown began on January 6. Other devolved regions are also similarly gradually easing up, with schools back in full force in Scotland and a stay-at-home lockdown in Wales being lifted.The next significant lockdown roadmap date is May 17, when up to six people from different households could be allowed to socialise indoors.The latest stage comes as more than 32 million people in the UK have now had their first dose of a coronavirus vaccine and of those 7.4 million have also had their second dose. Saturday marked a record day for the National Health Service (NHS) vaccination programme, with a record total of 475,230 second doses administered along with 111,109 first doses.Meanwhile, the daily death toll from the deadly virus continues a downward trend, with seven deaths reported on Sunday – the lowest daily death toll last September.Everyone in England is now also being encouraged to access free, rapid lateral flow tests for themselves and their families to use twice a week, as an added method of monitoring infection rates.Rapid lateral flow tests are said to detect cases with high levels of virus and are very effective in finding people who do not have symptoms but are very likely to transmit the disease. Anyone testing positive is then expected to follow up with a more reliable PCR test.People who have been in contact with someone who has tested positive with COVID-19 can also order a PCR test during their 10-day self-isolation period, whether or not they have symptoms.From Sunday, an updated “Hands, Face, Space, Fresh Air” campaign is also being used to remind the public of the need to use the NHS COVID-19 app to check in to premises, including outdoor hospitality, hairdressers and gyms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/behave-responsibly-uk-pm-boris-johnson-appeals-as-covid-19-lockdown-eases-101618218109171.html
12-04-2021||World||Russian feminist activist on 'Kafkaesque' trial on pornography charges||A Russian court on Monday opened the trial of a feminist activist and artist charged with disseminating pornography after she shared artwork depicting female anatomy online — a case in line with the Kremlin’s conservative stance promoting “traditional family values” that has been widely seen as controversial and elicited international outrage.Yulia Tsvetkova, 27, from the far-eastern city of Komsomolsk-on-Amur, faces up to six years in prison on charges reportedly related to her group on the popular social network VKontakte where colorful, stylized drawings of vaginas were posted. Tsvetkova is not allowed to give details of accusations against her.The first hearing in the Komsomolsk-on-Amur court on Monday comes a year and a half after Tsvetkova was first detained, and eight months after Russian President Vladimir Putin signed constitutional amendments that outlawed same-sex marriage and tasked the government with “preserving traditional family values.”Tsvetkova's lawyer, Irina Ruchko, told reporters after the hearing that Tsvetkova maintains her innocence and that her defense team intends to prove it in court.Tsvetkova ran a children’s theater and was a vocal advocate of feminism and LGBT rights. She founded an online group, called Vagina Monologues, encouraging followers to fight stigma and taboo surrounding the female body, and posted other people’s art in it.Amnesty International last week called the case, which is being heard behind closed doors, “Kafkaesque absurdity” and urged Russian authorities to drop all charges against the activist who was merely “freely expressing her views through art.”Tsvetkova was detained in November 2019 and spent the next four months under house arrest. Her home was raided, as well as her mother's education studio for children.The activist was fined twice for violating Russia’s law against disseminating gay “propaganda” to minors. The court ordered Tsvetkova to pay a fine of 50,000 rubles ($780) in December 2019 for running an LGBT-themed online group, and 75,000 rubles ($1,060) more in July 2020 for a drawing in support of LGBT families. The second fine was later decreased to 50,000 rubles.Many public figures have spoken out in her support, including Russian state TV veteran Vladimir Pozner. Activists across Russia protested her prosecution, artists dedicated performances to her, and an online petition demanding to drop the charges gathered over 250,000 signatures.The European Union's delegation to Russia said in a tweet last week that the bloc “is closely following" the case against Tsvetkova and that “apparently, her persecution is related to her public position as an LGBT activist." The delegation called on Russian authorities to stop the prosecution of the activist.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russian-feminist-activist-on-kafkaesque-trial-on-pornography-charges-101618217438653.html

12-04-2021||World||Prince Harry arrives back in the UK for Prince Philip funeral||Prince Harry, whose explosive interview alongside his wife Meghan plunged the royal family into its biggest crisis in decades, has arrived back in Britain for Prince Philip's funeral on Saturday.Philip, the husband of Britain's Queen Elizabeth who had been at her side throughout her 69-year reign, died at Windsor Castle on Friday.Harry, Philip's grandson, arrived in London on Sunday from Los Angeles on a British Airways flight, The Sun newspaper reported. Buckingham Palace said Meghan, who is pregnant, will not attend on the advice of her doctor.Harry, sixth in line to the throne, will quarantine in accordance with coronavirus guidelines so that he can attend the ceremonial funeral at Windsor Castle.Interviewed by Oprah Winfrey last month, Meghan said her pleas for help while she felt suicidal were ignored and that an unnamed member of the family had asked how dark their unborn child's skin might be.Harry also bemoaned his family’s reaction to their decision to step back from official duties and move to Los Angeles.In response, Queen Elizabeth said the royals were saddened by the challenging experiences of her grandson and Meghan and promised to privately address revelations about a racist remark about their son.Philip, who died aged 99, is lying at rest in the Private Chapel at Windsor Castle.'HUGE VOID'On Saturday, the coffin, covered by Philip's standard, a wreath, his naval cap and his sword, will be moved to the State Entrance of Windsor Castle by a bearer party from the Queen’s Company, 1st Battalion Grenadier Guards.Prince Charles and other members of the royal family will take part in a procession on foot behind the coffin, which will be carried by a specially modified Land Rover that Philip helped to design. The queen, 94, will not walk in the procession.As the coffin reaches St George's Chapel at Windsor, Britain will observe a minute of silence. There will be no public processions, and the funeral will be held entirely within the grounds of Windsor Castle and limited to 30 mourners in accordance with Covid-19 restrictions.A spring snow storm on Monday struck Windsor Castle, where Queen Elizabeth pondered the loss of her husband of 73 years.Her son Prince Andrew said on Sunday the queen was stoical in the face of a loss that she had described as "having left a huge void in her life".Andrew joined his siblings Charles, Anne and Edward in saying they had taken strength from a national outpouring of affection and would rally around their mother in her time of grief.Charles on Saturday paid tribute to his "dear Papa" who had given such devoted service to Queen Elizabeth, to the royal family, to Britain and to the Commonwealth, expressing gratitude for touching praise of his father.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/prince-harry-arrives-back-in-the-uk-for-prince-philip-funeral-101618214352722.html

12-04-2021||World||Dubai parts with curtains for restaurants to shield the site of food in Ramadan||Dubai is parting with a longstanding requirement that restaurants be covered by curtains in the daytime during Ramadan to shield the sight of food from people fasting.The move, announced Sunday by the city-state's Economic Development Department, is the latest change aimed at boosting tourism in the autocratically ruled Muslim nation.“Restaurants will be allowed to serve customers without putting in place curtains, dividers or facades as has been the mandatory practice previously,” the state-run WAM news agency said. “The new circular replaces circulars issued in previous years that have required restaurants to block dining areas from the sight of those who are fasting.”The new rules also don't require restaurants to obtain special permits to serve food during sunlight hours as well.During Ramadan, Muslims observing the holy month abstain from food and drink — even water — during the day. Muslims traditionally break the daylong Ramadan fast with their first sips of water and their evening meal, called iftar.Among Gulf Arab states, home to large, non-Muslim expatriate populations, most require curtains be put up to block the sight of food from those fasting. Eating and drinking in public also could bring fines and legal trouble.Dubai, one of the seven sheikhdoms in the United Arab Emirates, long has been a tourism destination for those wanting beaches, shopping and partying in this skyscraper-studded city. However, Ramadan always represented a slower period due to its restrictions.In recent years, hoping to boost tourism as Ramadan will be marked during its crucial winter months, Dubai has started to change. In 2016, Dubai loosened rules prohibiting daytime alcohol sales.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dubai-parts-with-curtains-for-restaurants-to-shield-the-site-of-food-in-ramadan-101618208405632.html

After the situation somewhat improved, a fresh resurgence of cases in Canada one year into the pandemic has now forced them to cancel plans to celebrate this year’s festive season.Kultar Singh Gill, chair of the Ontario Sikh and Gurdwara Council (OSGC), has said there’s no question of organising the annual Khalsa Day parade in Toronto, which attracts tens of thousands of participants at the venue in the city’s downtown, and has featured political leaders like Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, leaders of opposition parties and provincial leaders.Instead, they wanted to hold a motorcycle rally along the route of the parade on April 25, but those plans had to be cancelled because the province of Ontario has enforced stay-at-home orders. Gill said, “It has to be safety first and everybody understands that.” He was hopeful that Covid-19 cases are expected to subside gradually, so smaller events can be slotted for May.For now, he said, gurdwaras will mostly hold events virtually as provincial rules permit 15% in-person capacity at indoor events.That is also the case with Khalsa Diwan Society in Vancouver, which organises an annual parade that has also been attended by Trudeau. The society’s treasurer Kuldip Thandi said there will be no Vaisakhi celebrations this year.According to provincial authorities in British Columbia, “Indoor in-person religious gatherings and worship services of any size are prohibited.”Annually, April is observed as Sikh heritage month across Canada. The Nishan sahib, the pennant of the symbol of the faith, has been raised at some municipalities in Ontario, including Brampton. Local community leader Sukhminder Singh Hansra said it will also be raised at Toronto’s City Hall on April 19. It was raised at the beginning of the month at the city hall in Brampton in the Greater Toronto Area. Hansra said the community was planning a car rally to celebrate the month and the religious festivities associated with it, but it is no longer possible due to stay-at-home orders. Canada reported 7,619 new Covid-19 cases on Sunday, an increase of 68% over the last 14 days, taking the total number of confirmed infections in the country to 1,060,162, including 23,315 fatalities. Pubic health authorities have been cautioning against large gatherings, as Canada’s chief public health officer Dr Theresa Tam said on Sunday, “Several jurisdictions have highlighted social gatherings as an important driver for spread.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canadas-sikh-community-cancels-festivities-due-to-resurgence-in-covid-19-cases-101618208916437.html

There are reports of extrajudicial internment and forced labour camps. Family members of Canadian citizens with Chinese citizenship have been detained.”Canada also cautioned those who undertake journalism or research in China, particularly in Xinjiang or Tibet. “You should be particularly vigilant if researching or reporting on subjects critical of or sensitive to the government and in areas such as Tibet or Xinjiang,” says the advisory, pointing to instances of arrests of foreign journalists on grounds of national security violations.In general, Canada asked its citizens to exercise a high degree of caution if travelling to China “due to the risk of arbitrary enforcement of local laws”.In July last year, Canada sent out an advisory with regard to Hong Kong, warning that Canadians going there “may be at increased risk of arbitrary detention on national security grounds and possible extradition to mainland China”.Relations between Canada and China turned sour since the detention of Meng Wanzhou, CFO of Chinese telecom giant Huawei, in Vancouver in 2018. She was detained following an extradition request from the US for allegedly trying to bypass sanctions imposed on Iran.Days after her arrest, Chinese officials detained two Canadian nationals, Michael Spavor and Michael Korvig, who are in jail in what Canada has called “hostage diplomacy”. The two Michaels have been charged with spying and ferrying state secrets outside China.More recently, on February 22 this year, Canada’s House of Commons passed a resolution defining Chinese actions in Xinjiang as “genocide”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/avoid-travelling-to-china-s-xinjiang-canada-warns-its-citizens-101618206936095.html

The victim was identified by his family as 20-year-old Daunte Wright. A report by the Associated Press said that Wright was shot by the police before getting back into his car and driving away, then crashing the vehicle several blocks away. He was later pronounced dead, Wright's kin said.The incident took place 10 miles (16 km) from where George Floyd was killed during an arrest in Minneapolis last May, Reuters reported, adding that angry crowds protested outside the Brooklyn Center Police Department building on Sunday night, while officers in riot gear fired rubber bullets and lobbed flash bangs at protesters and let off clouds of chemical irritants.America is still recuperating with the death of George Floyd, who was killed last year after Derek Chauvin, one of the police officers who arrived on the scene, knelt on Floyd's neck for over nine minutes. After his death, protests against police brutality, especially towards Black people, quickly spread across the United States and internationally. Tensions are running high in Minneapolis, already on edge and midway through the ongoing trial of Derek Chauvin, who is charged with murder and manslaughter, in George Floyd’s death. In the hours after the shooting on Sunday, protesters clashed with police in riot gear, breaking a cruiser’s windshield as police fired nonlethal rounds, the Minneapolis Star Tribune reported.Minnesota Governor Tim Walz said in a statement that he was monitoring the unrest in Brooklyn Center, a suburb of Minneapolis, as "our state mourns another life of a Black man taken by law enforcement."“I am closely monitoring the situation in Brooklyn Center. Gwen and I are praying for Daunte Wright’s family as our state mourns another life of a Black man taken by law enforcement,” Governor Tim Walz said in a statement posted late Sunday night on Twitter.I am closely monitoring the situation in Brooklyn Center. Gwen and I are praying for Daunte Wright’s family as our state mourns another life of a Black man taken by law enforcement.Officials from the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension said the agency was on the scene, as per the AP report. Citing a statement from the Brooklyn Center Police, the agency reported that officers stopped an individual shortly before 2pm on Sunday after determining the driver had an outstanding warrant. Police said when they tried to arrest the driver, the driver reentered the vehicle and drove away. An officer fired at the vehicle, striking the driver. Police said the vehicle traveled several blocks before striking another vehicle. Police did not identify the driver who was shot but said the Hennepin County Medical Examiner’s Office will release the person’s name following a preliminary autopsy and family notification. A female passenger sustained non-life threatening injuries during the crash.Meanwhile, the Wrights demanded answers from police. Katie Wright, Daunte's mother, tearfully pleaded for more information regarding the incident and for her son’s body to be moved from the street. She told reporters at the scene, according to Reuters, that she received a call from her son on Sunday afternoon telling her that police had pulled him over for having air fresheners dangling from his rear-view mirror, illegal in Minnesota. She could hear police tell her son to get out the vehicle, she said.Public mourners included Wright's family and friends who gathered, wept and consoled each other alongside protesters who carried “Black Lives Matter” flags, jumped atop police cars, confronted officers and walked peacefully in columns with their hands help up. On one street, written in multi-colored chalk: “Justice for Daunte Wright.”The incident, which sparked protests late into Sunday night, happened with Minneapolis Brooklyn Center is a city with a population of about 30,000 people located on the northwest border of Minneapolis.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/minneapolis-police-shoot-dead-black-man-16km-from-where-george-floyd-was-killed-101618203661077.html
12-04-2021||World||Outrage over US Navy operation in India’s EEZ decades too late||The outrage over US Navy’s intrusion in India’s exclusive economic zone (EEZ) near Lakshadweep last week was decades too late.US warships have been conducting “operational assertion”, as these intrusive sail-throughs are called, to express America’s refusal to recognise certain maritime claims by India, at least since 1985, under a freedom of navigation programme it launched in 1979, according to defence department reports.India requires prior notice from foreign warships to enter its territorial sea, which extends its sovereignty 12 nautical miles from the baseline and requires prior permission for military exercises and manoeuvres in its exclusive economic zone, which extends it exclusive rights to economic resources for 200 nautical miles as per international maritime norms.The 7th Fleet, which is the largest in US Navy with an area of responsibility in the Western Pacific and Indian Oceans, sparked outrage in India last week with a statement saying one of its warships, USS John Paul Jones, “asserted navigational rights and freedoms” about 130 nautical miles west of the Lakshadweep islands. The ship was well inside India’s EEZ and was required by India to obtain prior permission, which the US did not.The external affairs ministry said in a statement India’s “stated position on the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea is that the convention does not authorise other states to carry out in the exclusive economic zone and on the continental shelf, military exercises or manoeuvres, in particular those involving the use of weapons or explosives, without the consent of the coastal state”.The US says it does not recognise India’s claims pertaining to both territorial sea jurisdiction and the EEZ. And it conducted “operational assertions” in India’s territorial sea, challenging India’s claims, for the first time in 1985, and continued through to 1989, and then from 1991 through 1994, and then in 1996, 1997, 1999, 2001, 2007, and 2011, according to the maritime claims reference manual issued by the defence department’s representative for ocean policy affairs.Disregarding India’s requirement of prior notice for military exercises in its EEZ, the report said the US conducted “operational assertions” in 1999, 2001, and from 2008 through to 2017 and then in 2019 - multiple times a year in many of them - according to US defence department reports.No specific reason or context was mentioned for any of these operational assertions individually. They were all covered by a generic “US does not recognise this claim”.The US has been conducting these operational assertions under the US Freedom of Navigation (FON) Programme launched in 1979 to “safeguard lawful commerce and the global mobility of US forces”, said the annual freedom of navigation report that the Pentagon sent to the Congress in 2020.The outrage, some experts argued, was not so much about the intrusion as it was about the aggressive tone of the 7th Fleet. “US pointedly says its navy entered India’s EEZ, noted India requires prior consent but not sought, and termed India’s excessive maritime claims as contrary to international law,” former foreign secretary Kanwal Sibal noted in a tweet. “Why aggressive tone now when issue old and not aired publicly? Result: Indian official reaction and tweet outpourings.” The US defines “excessive maritime claims” as “attempts by coastal states to unlawfully restrict the freedom of navigation, overflight and other lawful uses of the sea. These claims are made through laws, regulations or other pronouncements that are inconsistent with international law as reflected in the law of the sea convention. If left unchallenged, excessive maritime claims could infringe the freedom of the seas entitled to all nations”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/outrage-over-us-navy-operation-in-india-s-eez-decades-too-late-101618204956355.html

Japan has a rapidly ageing population totalling 126 million.Chief Cabinet Secretary Katsunobu Kato reiterated on Monday the government's projection that it can secure enough vaccines for Japan's 36 million people over the age of 65 by the end of June."If imports from the EU go smoothly, I understand the country is expected to distribute vaccines that can be administered to all of the elderly," Kato said.Tokyo also began on Monday a month-long period of quasi-emergency measures to blunt a fourth wave of contagion driven by virulent mutant strains and with the planned start of the Summer Olympics just over 100 days away.Japan was among the last major economies to begin Covid-19 inoculations when it started in mid-February. Taro Kono, the minister in charge of vaccines, has defended the pace, saying local governments wanted time to prepare."After tomorrow, we will inform the prefectures how much we can distribute, and they will decide how much to allocate to each municipality," Kono said on national broadcaster NHK on Sunday.Japan is dependent on Pfizer's vaccine as the only Covid-19 shot approved by domestic regulators. The pace of shots is likely to accelerate in May as a greater number of imports from the company's facilities in Europe is due to arrive.About 1.1 million people in Japan, mostly frontline healthcare workers, have gotten at least one dose of the Pfizer vaccine's two-shot regimen so far. Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga is among some 90 bureaucrats who were vaccinated ahead of a meeting with United States President Joe Biden this month.Shots for the general populace are not likely to be available until the late summer or even winter, too late to stem a resurgence of cases that appears to be focused on people in their 30s and 40s, according to Haruka Sakamoto, a physician and researcher at Keio University in Tokyo."The currently available vaccination cannot prevent the fourth wave of the pandemic," she said. "I think the younger generation is now going to be more greatly affected compared to the previous waves."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-starts-vaccinating-people-aged-65-and-above-as-fourth-covid-19-wave-looms-101618202252058.html
12-04-2021||World||China considers mixing Covid-19 vaccines to boost protection rate||China's top disease control official has said the country is formally considering mixing COVID-19 vaccines as a way of further boosting vaccine efficacy.Available data shows Chinese vaccines lag behind others including Pfizer and Moderna in terms of efficacy, but require less stringent temperature controls during storage.Giving people doses of different vaccines is one way to improve vaccines that "don't have very high rates of protection", Gao Fu, the director of the Chinese Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said on Saturday, without specifying whether he was referring to foreign or domestic vaccines"Inoculation using vaccines of different technical lines is being considered," Gao told a conference in the Chinese city of Chengdu.Gao said that taking steps to "optimise" the vaccine process including changing the number of doses and the length of time between doses was a "definite" solution to efficacy issues.Two injections of a vaccine developed by China's Sinovac Biotech, when given shorter than three weeks apart, was 49.1% effective based on data from a Phase III trial in Brazil, below the 50% threshold set by World Health Organization, according to a paper published by Brazilian researchers on Sunday ahead of peer review.But data from a small subgroup showed that the efficacy rate increased to 62.3% when the doses were given at intervals of three weeks and longer. The overall efficacy rate for the vaccine was slightly above 50% in the trial.China has developed four domestic vaccines approved for public use and a fifth for smaller-scale emergency use. An official said on Saturday that the country will likely produce 3 billion doses by the end of the year.No detailed efficacy data has been released on vaccines made by China's Sinopharm. It has said two vaccines developed by its units are 79.4% and 72.5% effective respectively, based on interim results.Both vaccine makers have presented data on their COVID-19 vaccines indicating levels of efficacy in line with those required by WHO, a WHO panel said in March.China has shipped millions of its vaccines abroad, and officials and state media have fiercely defended the shots while calling into question the safety and logistics capabilities of other vaccines."The global vaccine protection rate test data are both high and low," Gao told state tabloid Global Times on Sunday."How to improve the protection rate of vaccines is a problem that requires global scientists to consider," Gao said, adding that mixing vaccines and adjusting immunisation methods are solutions that he had proposed.Gao also rejected claims by some media reports that he said Chinese COVID-19 vaccines have a low protection rate, telling Global Times that it was "a complete misunderstanding."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-considers-mixing-covid-19-vaccines-to-boost-protection-rate-101618200725056.html
12-04-2021||World||NASA shares images of electric blue dunes on Mars||The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) recently shared an image of Mars in which the surface of the Red Plant, which looks like it is electric blue in colour, is visible.The image, shared by the space agency with the title 'Blue Dunes on the Red Planet', combines shots taken between December 2002 and November 2004 by the Thermal Emission Imaging System instrument on the Mars Odyssey orbiter.Two types of dunes are seen in the image. One set is yellowish in colour and signifies warmer climates, and the other set is bluish or pale that represents colder climates."In this false-color image, areas with cooler temperatures are recorded in bluer tints, while warmer features are depicted in yellows and oranges. Thus, the dark, sun-warmed dunes glow with a golden color. This image covers an area 19 miles (30 kilometers) wide," NASA said.The set of images, clicked on the Red Planet at 80.3 degrees north latitude, 172.1 degrees east longitude, were released to mark the 20th anniversary of Odyssey, the longest-working Mars spacecraft in history.NASA had shared images of blue Martian dunes earlier in 2018 and earlier this year, the agency posted some breathtaking images of how the blue planet looks from space.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nasa-shares-images-of-electric-blue-dunes-on-mars-101618197287564.html
12-04-2021||World||Russia, China protecting own interests in Myanmar by blocking arms embargo: EU||EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said on Sunday it was "no surprise" that Moscow and Beijing were blocking efforts at the UN Security Council to impose an arms embargo as the international efforts to halt the violence in Myanmar is yet to yield results."The world is horrified by the bloody military coup in Myanmar, with reports of more than 80 people killed in Bago last Friday. We are pursuing a robust diplomatic initiative in close coordination with like-minded partners. However, geopolitical competition in Myanmar makes it difficult to find common ground, to halt the violence and ensure a return to democracy," Borell wrote in a blog post.The bloc's foreign policy chief further stated that even in the face of "such brutality", geopolitics divides the international community and hampers a coordinated response.Borell noted that Myanmar's location makes it a strategic point for China's Belt and Road Initiative (offering deep-sea access to the Indian Ocean), but also to India's own corridor to the South China Sea. Other countries like Japan, South Korea and Singapore also have strong economic interests in Myanmar. And Russia is the country's second supplier of weapons, after China."Therefore, it comes as no surprise that Russia and China are blocking the attempts of the UN Security Council, for example, to impose an arms embargo. China is keen to protect its strategic interests in the country and has called the coup 'a major government reshuffle', while Russia insists that it is a purely 'domestic matter'," he said.He also stated that the situation in the country is complicated by Myanmar's highly diverse and complex ethnic fabric: there are 135 recognised ethnicities within its borders and some, like the Rohingya, are not even recognised. The conflict between ethnic minorities and the central government has been going on since independence, he pointed out.Borell called on the bloc to play an active role adding that the bloc "cannot accept that a democratically-elected government is overthrown and replaced by military rule."Despite the bloc, the US and the UK have imposed sanctions on the junta, he said that "Sanctions in itself are not a policy" and called for a "need to create a shared diplomatic platform to kick-start a process of dialogue aimed at restoring democracy in Myanmar, in accordance with the clear will of its brave people."Over 80 people were killed in Myanmar's central town of Bago on Friday as military and police forces continue their crackdown against protestors using heavy weapons, NHK reported citing a human rights group.The Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP) monitoring group and Myanmar Now news outlet said on Saturday that 82 people were killed on Friday during the protest against the February 1 military coup in the country.Military and police forces began attacks on the protestors early Friday morning, using guns, bombs, and other heavy weapons, causing many casualties. The human rights group says that as of Saturday, 701 people have died since the military coup.On February 1, Myanmar's military overthrew the civilian government and declared a year-long state of emergency. The coup triggered mass protests met by the deadly violence, resulting in hundreds of people having been killed since then.Protests broke out in Myanmar against the coup. People hit the streets in various streets, demanding the restoration of civilian government. In response, the security forces have used rubber bullets and live rounds to break up rallies and detained thousands of activists.International powers have voiced anger and dismay at the junta's brutal approach and imposed sanctions on key officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-china-protecting-own-interests-in-myanmar-by-blocking-arms-embargo-eu-101618195113323.html
12-04-2021||World||Probe ordered after US police pepper-spray Black soldier||The governor of the US state of Virginia vowed a full investigation Sunday after footage emerged of two police officers detaining a Black army officer at gunpoint and pepper-spraying him in the face.Lieutenant Caron Nazario, who is Black and Latino, repeatedly asked what he had done wrong and said, "This is really messed up," as the officers holding guns demanded he get out of his car.The police accused him of not cooperating.Nazario, wearing his military uniform, was driving a newly bought SUV when the officers ordered him to pull over because he did not have permanent license plates, news reports said.Virginia governor Ralph Northam said in a statement he had instructed police to conduct an "independent investigation" into the incident, which he said was "disturbing and angered me."Police in the United States have been hit with multiple allegations of racism and misconduct, including over the death of a Black man in Minneapolis last year in a case that attracted international outrage.A police officer is currently on trial over George Floyd's death, facing charges of manslaughter and murder.The Washington Post said that Nazario, a health administration officer with the Virginia National Guard, was driving home on December 5 when he was pulled over.Footage from the officers' bodycams and Nazario's phone spread rapidly over the weekend after Nazario filed a lawsuit on April 2 seeking $1 million in damages.He was released without charge after the incident.The lawsuit reportedly claims police threatened to end his military career if he spoke out about the officers' conduct."We must keep working to ensure Virginians are safe during interactions with police, the enforcement of laws is fair and equitable, and people are held accountable," Northam said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/probe-ordered-after-us-police-pepper-spray-black-soldier-101618193062139.html
12-04-2021||World||US issues warning to China; says action against Taiwan would be 'serious mistake'||US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Sunday (local time) issued a warning to China stating it would be a "serious mistake" for anyone to attempt to change Taiwan's "status quo" amid heightened tensions between Washington and Beijing over the island country's sovereignty."What we have seen and what is a real concern to us is increasingly aggressive actions by the government in Beijing, directed at Taiwan, raising tensions in the straits. And we have a commitment to Taiwan under the Taiwan Relations Act, a bipartisan commitment that's existed for many, many years, to make sure that Taiwan has the ability to defend itself and to make sure that we're sustaining peace and security in the Western Pacific. We stand behind those commitments," Blinken said in an interview with NBC News, according to a transcript provided by the US Department of State."I can tell you is it would be a serious mistake for anyone to try to change the existing status quo by force," the top US diplomat added.When pressed on whether Washington's "commitments" included military action, Blinken responded that he would not be discussing "hypotheticals" and instead stated the US would stand by its commitment to allow Taiwan to defend itself."All I can tell you is we have a serious commitment to Taiwan being able to defend itself. We have a serious commitment to peace and security in the Western Pacific. And in that context, it would be a serious mistake for anyone to try to change that status quo by force," he said.In what could be called another massive blow to China, the United States last week issued new guidelines that encourage exchanges with Taiwanese counterparts, State Department spokesperson Ned Price.According to South China Morning Post, the guidelines are a move made to bring Washington into compliance with a law signed by former President Donald Trump.The announcement comes amid heightened tensions between the US and China over Taiwan.White House spokesperson Jen Psaki told reporters on Friday that Washington has been watching China's aggressive actions against Taiwan very closely and raising concerns about it both publicly and privately."We have been clear publicly and privately expressing our concern, our growing concerns about China's aggression towards Taiwan. China is taking increasingly coercive action to undercut democracy in Taiwan," Psaki said during the briefing.US lawmakers plan to introduce legislation next week that would put additional sanctions on Chinese officials; build closer US relations with Taiwan and place more checks on Beijing's military operations and territorial claims, among other measures intended to counter China and the threat it poses on human rights and maritime security.Beijing claims full sovereignty over Taiwan, a democracy of almost 24 million people located off the southeastern coast of mainland China, despite the fact that the two sides have been governed separately for more than seven decades.Taipei, on the other hand, has countered the Chinese aggression by increasing strategic ties with democracies including the US, which has been repeatedly opposed by Beijing. China has threatened that "Taiwan's independence" means war.Taiwan returned to the forefront of US-China tensions last weekend when Beijing sent more than two dozen warplanes into the self-governing island's air defence identification zone in a 48-hour period.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-issues-warning-to-china-says-action-against-taiwan-would-be-serious-mistake-101618190870635.html
12-04-2021||World||'Forced confession' victims urge Chinese TV channels ban||Thirteen people who describe themselves as "victims of forced confessions broadcast on Chinese television" are urging European satellite operator Eutelsat to reconsider carrying Chinese channels CGTN and CCTV4.The letter published by human rights watchdog Safeguard Defenders details a list of violations that the signatories say China is guilty of using to extort confessions from them and "refuse the right to a fair trial"."We are asking you... to determine whether television providers in democratic societies ought to continue to be morally complicit in the broadcast of information that is intentionally twisted and obtained through torture," the group said."We are only a dozen victims able to speak out.... Many other victims are in prison. A few have been executed."The victims have no way of demanding reparations. The only way to stop this is for television regulators to investigate and take measures," the group added.The letter notes Australian public broadcaster SBS stopped using content from Chinese state-run television in March pending a review of human rights concerns.The UK also fined CGTN for partiality and violation of privacy and removed it from the airwaves, a ban that pushed the channel to set up shop in France.French audiovisual regulator CSA determined in March that CGTN met the technical criteria necessary for broadcasting but just this week Safeguard Defenders submitted two complaints against the channel.One cited an allegedly coerced interview with a Uyghur child and the other was a defamation complaint from German researcher Adrian Zenz, whose reports on the treatment of Uyghurs in China's western Xinjiang region have drawn rebukes from Beijing.The signatories are from China and other countries, including Chinese human rights lawyers Bao Longjun and Jiang Tianyong who have been targeted by authorities in their country.Simon Cheng, a former British consulate staffer in Hong Kong, who was granted asylum in the UK after allegedly being tortured by Chinese secret police also signed the letter.Also giving support is Swedish activist and Safeguard Defenders co-founder Peter Dahlin, who spent three weeks in jail in 2016 before being expelled from the country as a national security threat.Angela Gui, daughter of Gui Minhai who published in Hong Kong until he was sentenced to 10 years in prison in 2020, signed on behalf of her father.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/forced-confession-victims-urge-chinese-tv-channels-ban-101618186922878.html
12-04-2021||World||Top US diplomat criticizes China, says 'need to get to the bottom' of Covid-19 origin||China's failure to provide access to global health experts made the Covid-19 pandemic worse than it had to be, U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken said on Sunday, and it was important to "get to the bottom" of the origin of the novel coronavirus.The top U.S. diplomat's sharp words underscored criticism from other members of the Biden administration over Beijing's lack of transparency in the crucial early days of the pandemic.China did not give access to international experts or share information in real time to provide true transparency, Blinken said in an interview with NBC's "Meet the Press."As a result, the virus "got out of hand faster and with, I think, much more egregious results than it might otherwise," Blinken said.The World Health Organization director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said on March 30 that data was withheld from WHO investigators who traveled to China to research the origins of the pandemic.A WHO report, written jointly with Chinese scientists, released at the time said the virus had probably been transmitted from bats to humans through another animal, and that a lab leak was "extremely unlikely" as a cause.Tedros said the issue required further investigation.The events highlight why there needs to be a stronger global health security system to ensure this doesn't happen again, Blinken said. Reforms must include a commitment to transparency, information sharing and access for experts "and China has to play a part in that," he said.Blinken said it was important to reach a more conclusive accounting of how the pandemic began."We need to do that precisely so we fully understand what happened, in order to have the best shot possible preventing it from happening again," he said. "That's why we need to get to the bottom of this." When the WHO report was issued in March, the United States, the European Union and other Western countries called for China to give "full access" to independent experts to all data about the original outbreak in late 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/top-us-diplomat-criticizes-china-says-need-to-get-to-the-bottom-of-covid-19-origin-101618185853332.html

It did not appear that sensitive user information such as credit card numbers were among the leaked info. But the information could be used in phishing attempts to get users to hand over that more sensitive info.Last week, Cyber News reported on another data breach from a social platform: it found that personal data for 500 million LinkedIn users had been scraped and posted online. The Microsoft-owned company said that no private member account data from LinkedIn was included in the leak.As reported by The Verge, that news came just a couple of days after it was discovered that personal data for some 533 million Facebook users also was leaked online for free. The Facebook leak reportedly included users' phone numbers, birthdates, locations, email addresses, and full names.The social audio app Clubhouse had a monster first year- despite being invite-only and available only on iOS devices- seeing more than 10 million downloads.Twitter, LinkedIn, Discord, Spotify, and Slack have all launched or are working on competing for social audio platforms, and Facebook reportedly has one in the works as well.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/personal-info-for-1-3-million-clubhouse-users-leaked-online-report-101618185519451.html
12-04-2021||World||Fed's Powell sees US boom ahead, with Covid-19 still a risk||The US economy is poised for an extended period of strong growth and hiring, the chair of the Federal Reserve said in an interview broadcast Sunday, though the coronavirus still poses some risk.Chair Jerome Powell, speaking to CBS' “60 Minutes," also said that he doesn't expect to raise the Fed's benchmark interest rate, currently pegged at nearly zero, this year. And he downplayed the risk of higher inflation stemming from sharp increases in government spending and expanding budget deficits.“We feel like we’re at a place where the economy’s about to start growing much more quickly and job creation coming in much more quickly,” Powell said. “This growth that we’re expecting in the second half of this year is going to be very strong. And job creation, I would expect to be very strong.”In the wide-ranging interview, Powell said that the Fed is closely studying the development of a digital dollar, but hasn't yet made a decision on whether to proceed. Powell said last month that the central bank wouldn't issue a digital currency without approval from Congress.Powell noted that roughly a million jobs were added in March, when revisions to jobs data in January and February are included. The unemployment rate fell to 6% from 6.2%.“We would like to see a string of months like that,” he said. “That is certainly in the range of possibility.”Still, there are about 8.4 million fewer jobs than before the pandemic, and Powell acknowledged that he sees a homeless encampment near the Fed's headquarters in Washington.“There’s a lot of suffering out there still. And I think it’s important that, just as a country, we stay and help those people,” he said. “The economy that we’re going back to is going to be different from the one that we had.”Powell also said the primary risk to the economy remains the pandemic and a breakdown in precautions that Americans have largely taken for the past year.The principal risk ”is that we will reopen too quickly, people will too quickly return to their old practices, and we’ll see another spike in cases,” he said. “The economy should move ahead. But it can move ahead more quickly to the extent we keep the spread of Covid under control.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/feds-powell-sees-us-boom-ahead-with-covid-19-still-a-risk-101618184570338.html
12-04-2021||World||Biden team eyes potential threat from China’s digital yuan plans||The Biden administration is stepping up scrutiny of China’s plans for a digital yuan, with some officials concerned the move could kick off a long-term bid to topple the dollar as the world’s dominant reserve currency, according to people familiar with the matter.Now that China’s digital-currency efforts are gathering momentum, officials at the Treasury, State Department, Pentagon and National Security Council are bolstering their efforts to understand the potential implications, the people said.American officials are less worried about an immediate challenge to the current structure of the global financial system, but are eager to understand how the digital yuan will be distributed, and whether it could also be used to work around U.S. sanctions, the people said on the condition of anonymity.A Treasury spokeswoman declined to comment. A National Security Council spokeswoman did not reply to a request for comment.The People’s Bank of China has rolled out trial issuance of a digital yuan in cities across the country, putting it on track to be the first major central bank to issue a virtual currency. A broader roll-out is expected for the Winter Olympics in Beijing next February, giving the effort international exposure.Many key details of the digital yuan are still in flux, including specifics on how it would be distributed. China’s recent establishment of a joint venture with SWIFT, the messaging nexus through which most cross-border settlements pass through today, suggests it is possible a digital yuan could work within the current financial architecture rather than outside of it.U.S. officials are reassured that China’s intentions aren’t to use the digital yuan to evade American sanctions, according to people familiar with the matter. The dollar’s current dominance in cross-border transactions gives the U.S. Treasury the power to cut off much of a business or even a country’s access to the global financial system.China’s officials have said the main intentions of the digital yuan are to replace banknotes and coins, to reduce the incentive to use cryptocurrencies and to complement the current private-sector run electronic payments system -- dominated by Ant Group Co.’s Alipay and Tencent Holdings Ltd.’s WeChat Pay. The PBOC has been working for years on the digital yuan, also called the e-CNY, having set up a specialist research team in 2014.​​“To provide a backup or redundancy for the retail payment system, the central bank has to step up” and provide digital-currency services, Mu Changchun, the director of the PBOC’s digital-currency research institute, said at an event last month.The PBOC is also examining the potential for using the digital yuan in cross-border payments, launching a project studying the issue with a unit of the Bank for International Settlements along with the United Arab Emirates, Thailand and Hong Kong’s monetary authority.The Biden administration isn’t currently planning to take any action to counter longer-term threats from China’s digital currency, the people familiar with the discussions said. However, China’s plans have given renewed impetus to efforts to consider the creation of a digital dollar, they said.Members of Congress have also been increasingly interested in a digital dollar, aware of China’s moves, and asked Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen about the issue in hearings earlier this year.Powell said in February the Fed was looking “very carefully” at a digital dollar. “We don’t need to be the first. We need to get it right.”Yellen has signaled interest in research into the viability of a digital dollar, a shift from a lack of enthusiasm under her predecessor, Steven Mnuchin.“It makes sense for central banks to be looking at” issuing sovereign digital currencies, she said at a virtual conference in February. Yellen said a digital version of the dollar could help address hurdles to financial inclusion in the U.S. among low-income households.A recent report from the U.S. Director of National Intelligence said the extent of the threat of any foreign digital currency to the dollar’s centrality in the global financial system “will depend on the regulatory rules that are established.”China’s currency makes up little more than 2% of global foreign exchange reserves compared with nearly 60% for the U.S. dollar. Policy decisions, rather than technical developments, will also be necessary to push forward yuan internationalization, as China maintains a strict regime of capital controls.China’s financial system is too “fragile and weak” to pose a real threat to the dollar’s status as the world’s reserve currency, according to Mark Sobel, U.S. chairman for the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum.“At the end of the the day the markets have more confidence in the Fed” than China’s central bank, said Sobel, a former senior U.S. Treasury official for international matters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-team-eyes-potential-threat-from-china-s-digital-yuan-plans-101618184054832.html

12-04-2021||World||Brazil: 1,803 Covid-19 deaths; China's vaccine 50.7% effective against variant||Brazil on Sunday recorded 1,803 new Covid-19 deaths, as a large study found that a Chinese vaccine that has become the linchpin in the country's vaccination campaign is 50.7% effective against the infectious new homegrown variant known as P1.Brazil, which has in recent weeks become the global epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic, saw over 37,000 new cases, the Health Ministry said on Sunday. With over 353,000 deaths, Latin America's biggest country has the second highest coronavirus death toll in the world, after the United States.The outbreak has recently reached its most severe phase due to a lack of federal restrictions, a patchy vaccine rollout and the P1 variant.Sao Paulo's Butantan biomedical institute, which tested and is now producing the CoronaVac vaccine developed by China's Sinovac Biotech Ltd, said on Sunday a study it conducted found the shot had an efficacy rate of 50.7% against the P1 variant, and a less widespread strain known as P2.Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, a China hawk and vaccine skeptic who has come under fire for his handling of the outbreak, initially said his government would not buy the Sinovac shot, but later made a U-turn as his government struggled to secure supplies. Since then, the Chinese shot has become the most widely administered one in the country.Butantan said that if the second dose is delayed by more than two weeks, the efficacy rises to 62.3%. The vaccine has an efficacy of between 83.7% and 100% at preventing those infected from requiring medical assistance, it said.The study, which it said had been sent to the medical journal The Lancet for publication, tested 12,400 volunteers across Brazil.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brazil-1-803-covid-19-deaths-china-s-vaccine-50-7-effective-against-variant-101618180759233.html
12-04-2021||World||'The right path': Chile defends Sinovac use amid fresh efficacy questions||Chilean authorities on Sunday backed the country's widespread use of the Covid-19 vaccine manufactured by Chinese firm Sinovac after China's top disease official appeared to make conflicting statements about its efficacy.Gao Fu, the director of the Chinese Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told a conference in the Chinese city of Chengdu on Saturday that the country was considering mixing Covid-19 vaccines since currently available vaccines "don't have very high rates of protection."He later said in an interview with state media that his comments were "completely misunderstood."Available data shows Chinese vaccines lag behind others including Pfizer and Moderna in terms of efficacy, but require less stringent temperature controls during storage.The Covid-19 vaccine developed by China's Sinovac was found to be just over 50% effective in reducing infection in Brazilian clinical trials. A real-world study of vaccination and contagion data by the University of Chile suggested last week the vaccine was 54% effective in reducing infection.Chile paid $3.5 million to host a clinical trial of the vaccine and has also ordered 60 million doses to be administered to its 18 million-strong population over three years.The country has largely relied on the Sinovac vaccine, along with smaller numbers of Pfizer's equivalent drug, to roll out one of the world's fastest vaccination campaigns, so far inoculating 4.6 million people with two doses and 7.2 million with one.Chile also signed deals for the supply of vaccines from western drugmakers Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca but these are yet to materialise because of supply bottlenecks.On Sunday, Chilean science minister Andres Couve said it was important to focus on the data and the vaccine's effectiveness in reducing illness that required medical treatment or being hospitalized or dying, which it achieved in the Brazilian study in 83.7% and 100% of cases respectively.He said Chile's health ministry will shortly publish a real world study on the effectiveness of both vaccines rolled out in its population and appealed to Chileans to continue to participate in the vaccination programme.Heriberto Garcia, director of Chile's Public Health Institute which greenlighted CoronaVac's emergency roll-out, said people should not pay attention to headlines."The University of Chile study and the study the health ministry will release say the same thing: the number of people who fall ill and are hospitalized has decreased," he told local newspaper La Tercera. "We are going down the right path."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/the-right-path-chile-defends-sinovac-use-amid-fresh-efficacy-questions-101618178464415.html
12-04-2021||World||English shops and pub gardens reopen in 'major step' to freedom||England's shops, hairdressers, gyms and pub gardens will reopen on Monday in what Prime Minister Boris Johnson said was a "major step" towards freedom from the restrictions of the Covid-19 pandemic.Hundreds of thousands of businesses have been closed since early January when England entered a third lockdown to stem surging infections driven by the "Kent" variant of the virus.A vaccination campaign that has delivered a first shot to well over half of adults and lockdown measures have cut deaths by more than 95% and cases by over 90% from the January peak.Sunday's seven deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test is the lowest daily death toll by this measure since Sept 14.That progress would allow a staged easing of lockdown to proceed, Johnson said earlier this month, adding that he was looking forward to a pint in a pub garden."I'm sure it will be a huge relief for those business owners who have been closed for so long, and for everyone else it's a chance to get back to doing some of the things we love and have missed," he said in a statement on Sunday."I urge everyone to continue to behave responsibly and remember 'hands, face, space and fresh air' to suppress Covid as we push on with our vaccination programme."With more than 127,000 fatalities, the United Kingdom has the fifth highest death toll in the world from Covid-19.Persuading people to return to some kind of normality and start spending again is key to Britain's recovery after official data last month showed that 2020 was the worst year for its economy in more than three centuries.UK retailers, which have lost an estimated 27 billion pounds ($37 billion) in sales during lockdowns, are hoping pent-up demand will fuel a trading boom.Non-essential stores, such as home and fashion chains, will reopen in Wales as well as England on Monday, although those in Scotland need to wait until April 26.Pubs and restaurants will only be able to serve outdoors from Monday, although early rules requiring meals to be served with drinks and curfews have been scrapped.Indoor service will not be allowed until May 17 at the earliest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/english-shops-and-pub-gardens-reopen-in-major-step-to-freedom-101618178477336.html
12-04-2021||World||Trump, speaking to donors, sharply insults top Republican Mitch McConnell||Addressing a meeting of affluent donors and top Republican officials, Donald Trump spent more time lashing out at fellow Republicans -- and most sharply at their Senate leader -- than at Democrats, news media reported Sunday.The former president, speaking Saturday to members of the Republican National Committee at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, called for party unity in the wake of his loss to Joe Biden and the party's loss of Senate control.But his polarizing ways and piercing criticism of fellow party members have created awkward complications for Republican leaders as they look to 2022 midterm elections and beyond.As Trump continued on Saturday to assert falsely that he won the November election, he particularly excoriated Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, calling him a "dumb (expletive)" and a "stone cold loser."Trump has blamed McConnell for not fighting to block Congress's January 6 certification of Biden's election victory -- certification that took place only after a pro-Trump mob violently stormed the Capitol building.McConnell later declared that Trump was "practically and morally responsible" for the deadly attack.- 'Did he say thank you?' -The former president, in his remarks Saturday, also criticized McConnell's wife, Elaine Chao, who was Trump's transportation secretary but who resigned following the events of January 6."I hired his wife. Did he ever say thank you?" Trump said, before mocking Chao for resigning.He then said he was "disappointed" in his own vice president, Mike Pence, for his role in certifying the election result.And he again attacked top US scientist Anthony Fauci, saying the epidemiologist is "full of crap."Without mentioning the more than 560,000 Americans who have died of Covid-19, Trump praised Republicans such as Florida governor Ron DeSantis for reopening their states early, in defiance of experts' advice.During the Mar-a-Lago meeting, which some Republicans said they hoped would focus more on the party's path forward, Trump instead rehashed past grievances, including his criticism of Republican officials in Georgia and Pennsylvania who had refused to support his claims of a stolen election.Describing the crowd at his January 6 rally -- several thousand people drawn to Washington by Trump's frequent pleas on Twitter -- he claimed that "some people say it was over a million people," a considerable exaggeration.McConnell did not attend the Mar-a-Lago event. He has told advisors he has not spoken to Trump in months and never plans to do so again, according to The Washington Post.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-speaking-to-donors-sharply-insults-top-republican-mitch-mcconnell-101618178530415.html
12-04-2021||World||Land Rover SUV redesigned by Prince Philip to carry his coffin||A Land Rover that Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh, helped design over 15 years ago will be part of the funeral procession of Duke of Edinburgh, Prince Philip, and will be flanked by pall bearers drawn from the Royal Marines as it transports the British Royal member’s coffin on April 17.Britain’s Prince Philip, Queen Elizabeth’s husband who died on Friday aged 99, will have a ceremonial funeral on Saturday without any public access or public procession, Buckingham Palace said.Prince Philip had a role in the design of the vehicle and had always wanted it to be involved in his funeral, a senior aide said, according to UK media reports.The vehicle is believed to be a modified Defender 130 Gun Bus, which was commissioned for use by the Queen’s late husband in 2005 – three years before the British luxury brands Jaguar and Land Rover (JLR) were taken over by Tata Motors.Saturday’s funeral will take place at St George’s Chapel at Windsor Castle after an eight-minute ceremonial procession within the castle’s grounds. There will be no public access, although the service and procession will be televised.“It will be what’s known as a ceremonial royal funeral,” a Buckingham Palace spokesperson said, adding: “The plans for the funeral are very much in line with the Duke of Edinburgh’s own personal wishes.”Philip currently lies at rest in the Private Chapel at Windsor Castle. There will be no lying in state. On April 17 the coffin will be moved from the State Entrance to St George’s Chapel for a funeral service.The service will begin with a national minute of silence. The congregation will adhere to national Covid guidelines. At the end of the service Philip will be interred in the Royal Vault in St George’s Chapel. Prince Philip’s death triggered eight days of national mourning, which ends with his funeral on Saturday.Well-rehearsed plans for his funeral -- codenamed “Operation Forth Bridge” -- have had to be hastily revised because of coronavirus restrictions.Public elements of the ceremony have been eliminated to avoid crowds gathering, while the congregation at the chapel is limited to just 30.That sparked huge speculation about whether the duke’s grandson Prince Harry will attend, after he and his American wife and actor Meghan quit royal duties last year.Buckingham Palace on Saturday confirmed Harry’s attendance but said Meghan, who is heavily pregnant with the couple’s second child, would not travel on medical advice.The couple, who now live in the United States, have launched a series of broadsides against the royals, including charges of racism and not looking after Meghan’s mental health.‘Huge void’Queen Elizabeth II has been left bereft at the death of her husband, Prince Philip, one of their sons said on Sunday, as prayers were said at memorial services across Britain.Prince Andrew said his 94-year-old mother was “incredibly stoic” but had been hit hard by the death of the Duke of Edinburgh on Friday. Last year the couple celebrated 73 years of marriage. “She described it (his death) as having left a huge void in her life,” Andrew said after a church service at Windsor Castle, west of London. The Queen and Philip’s second son described his father as “the grandfather of the nation” and said close family were “rallying round” his mother.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/land-rover-suv-redesigned-by-prince-philip-to-carry-his-coffin-101618167270671.html

Only Israel (95.1%) and the Seychelles (94.1%) have vaccinated a higher percentage of adults, but in months, the report adds.Earlier on Wednesday, government officials told news agency AFP that 470,000 people out of 770,000 in total had been administered the first shot of the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine donated by India.The numbers are fortified from Our World in Data, which shows that 61.45% of the country’s entire population had received at least one dose of the vaccine until April 10.But the Himalayan kingdom’s ambitious vaccination drive, which began nine days ago, hasn’t always been straightforward.Bhutan — which has so far recorded a total 918 Covid-19 cases and one fatality — received the vaccine from India in January. However, the Zhung Dratshang, a body of Buddhist monks, advised the government that the stars weren’t auspicious. And so, the first jab was given nearly two months later to a woman named Ninda Dema — born in the Year of the Monkey, the Economist report says.From there on, it was an upward trend.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bhutan-delivers-first-vaccine-dose-to-85-of-adult-population-in-a-week-101618165949479.html

State chief secretary VP Joy convened a meeting of the core committee on the pandemic on Monday and decided to introduce strict measures.State health minister KK Shailaja admitted that the next two weeks will be crucial for the state. “It is a fact that during the elections, most of the restrictions were thrown to winds. Cases are likely to up considerably in the next two weeks. There is no need for panic but people should be extra cautious,” she said.“Restaurants and hotels will be closed at 9 pm and any public event can’t go on for more than two hours. Mega shopping festivals and other big events will not be allowed till further notice. Public feasts will not be allowed and in hotels, the capacity will be restricted to 50% only. Social distancing and masking will be implemented with full force and cops have been instructed accordingly,” a state government spokesman said. On Monday, Kerala reported 5,692 new cases with a test positivity rate of (TPR) of 12.53%. North Kerala’s district Kozhikode reported maximum cases, 1,010. The active caseload of Covid-19 stands at 47.596 in the state as it reported 11 more deaths taking the toll to 4,794.Health ministry statistics show there is a steady rise in new cases and the TPR in the last ten days. On April 1, new Covid-19 cases were 2,798 but on April 12 they shot up to 5,692. Similarly, the TPR was below five% in the first week of April while it went up to 12.53% on Monday.

It went up again after the local body elections, clocking 14 to 15% in December but came down after two months in March.During the recently-concluded assembly election, Covid-19 safety norms were flouted by almost all political parties and health officials fear another high in the coming days. Hospital admissions have also been high in the past week. Health ministry officials warn of a shortage of ICU beds if the situation continues.Last week, chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan and former CM Oommen Chandy tested positive for the virus and both are recuperating. The state has also sent samples to the Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology to find if any variation has occurred in the strain of SARS-CoV 2 in the state. Health officials said results will be expected by this weekend. Records show the state has a long way to make the vaccination drive effective. As of now, only 10.13% of the population has been vaccinated against Covid-19. The state’s biggest achievement is its low mortality rate - 0.14 against the national average of 1.52%, statistics show.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-announces-fresh-curbs-as-covid-19-cases-soar-101618245218000.html

12-04-2021||India||Sonia Gandhi writes to PM Modi on Covid-19 crisis, flags 3 issues||Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Monday shot off a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi with a slew of requests to bring the coronavirus pandemic under control in the country, which has been witnessing a second wave. Gandhi urged Prime Minister Modi to allow the emergency use of those Covid-19 vaccine candidates, which have the required clearance. She also underscored the need for a vaccine prioritisation strategy for effective results in the fight against the virus."While it will be necessary on one hand to substantially ramp up our domestic production capacity, it will also be prudent to allow emergency use authorization of all the vaccine candidates that have the required clearances, without any further delay,” Gandhi said and added that vaccines are our foremost hope as she also pointed that most of the states are left with stock for just three to five days.Gandhi's letter comes two days after she held a meeting with heads of Congress-ruled states and leaders from alliance states to review the efforts to fight Covid-19 including the availability of vaccines, access to medicines and ventilators. In that meeting last Saturday, Congress-ruled Punjab, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh said that they had a limited supply of Covid-19 vaccines and urged the Centre to ramp up the supply.Shortly after that meeting, Gandhi slammed the Centre for "mismanaging" the Covid-19 situation and creating a vaccine shortage in the country by exporting it, as she called for cancelling all public gatherings and poll rallies in view of the rising number of coronavirus cases.Gandhi also urged PM Modi to allow the vaccination of people based on need instead of age as is being done right now. "Accordingly, with enhanced availability, categories eligible for vaccination should be expanded on the basis of need and exposure rather than just age. In the same vein, the numbers allocated to a state has to be based on the prevalence and projection of infection in that particular state,” she said in her letter on Monday.The Congress leader pointed out that the medical infrastructure required to combat the viral contagion needs to be exempted from Goods and Services Tax (GST), in order to make them less expensive. "All equipment, instruments, medicines and support infrastructure required to deal with the Covid-19 crisis should be made completely exempt from GST. Even ventilators, oxymeters and oxygen cylinders presently attract GST as do key life-saving drugs like Remdesivir and Dexamethazone," Gandhi wrote in her letter.Urging the PM to put in place a minimum monthly guaranteed income scheme, Gandhi sought an economic relief plan in which the government can transfer ₹6000 into every eligible citizen's account. She highlighted that restricting economic activity will have a drastic impact on migrant labourers and poor people. "As we move ahead to control the situation by resorting to curfews, travel restrictions, closures and lockdowns, we will again be restricting economic activity that will hit the already beleaguered people - especially the poor and the daily wagers very, very hard," the letter read.In her previous rebuke of the Centre, Gandhi alleged that the Modi government has mismanaged the Covid situation. "It has exported the vaccines and allowed a shortage to be created in India," the Congress chief had said at the meeting. "Mass gatherings for elections and religious events have accelerated Covid-19 for which all of us are responsible to some extent. We need to accept this responsibility and keep the interest of the nation above our own," Sonia Gandhi said.India on Monday registered 168,912 new Covid-19 cases, the highest single-day rise so far, taking the tally to 13,527,717, according to the Union ministry of health and family welfare. The national recovery rate has fallen below 90 per cent, data showed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sonia-gandhi-writes-to-pm-modi-on-covid-19-crisis-flags-3-issues-101618234067946.html

12-04-2021||India||Covid-19 a reminder human, animal health interconnected: Harsh Vardhan||Union minister Harsh Vardhan said on Monday the increased interaction between humans and animals has made it impossible to view issues of human health in isolation, adding that the Covid-19 pandemic shows that they are closely connected. “With increased interaction between humans and animals, human health can't be seen in isolation and Covid-19 is more than a reminder,” Harsha Vardhan said.Vardhan was speaking at the ‘One Health in India: Research Informing Biosafety, Preparedness and Response’ symposium organised by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). The One Health—an interdisciplinary approach that views human and animal health to be interconnected—gained traction at the peak of the Covid-19 pandemic last year.“The ‘One Health’ approach recognises that people's health is closely connected with animals' health,” he said at the symposium. “Covid19 demonstrates the rapid spread of novel pathogens which can have a significant impact on the global economy. Preparedness for and mitigation of such events require a 'One Health' approach,” he added.While talking about zoonotic viruses, Vardhan said India is one of the four global hotspots for the emergence of zoonotic diseases and added that the coronavirus has caused much damage around the world and “we are struggling even after 15 months".Vardhan also stressed the changes in climate and land use pattern causing disruptions in natural habitats of animals opening up new ways for diseases to spread. “The earth has experienced changes in climate and land use with practices like deforestation and intensive farming. Disruptions in environmental habitats can provide new opportunities for diseases to pass to animals,” he said.During the budget session, Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman launched the Prime Minister Aatmanirbhar Swasth Bharat Yojana, with an outlay of about ₹64,180 crore over a period of six years, which included the setting up of a national institution for the ‘One Health’ approach."Health and well being have formed the topmost priority of the Union Government during the ongoing Covid-19 health crisis. It is the foremost of the six crucial pillars that form the foundation of the Union Budget," the minister had said in Parliament.Vardhan also announced the creation of an Eco-Health initiative for India, which will be supported by the National Institute of One Health. He also launched the Indian Journal of Medical Research’s special issue on ‘One Health’.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-a-reminder-human-animal-health-interconnected-harsh-vardhan-101618235994669.html

The move comes in a bid to curb the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic. The ministry, however, has allowed meals for other flights with a flying time of more than 120 minutes. Such airlines will have to provide disposable cutlery and serve only pre-packed food. This order will come into effect from April 15.Tea, coffee, alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages have been allowed to be served only in disposable cans or bottles or glasses. “There will be no pouring services and beverages will be served in single-use disposable units and all the disposables will be disposed of in trash bags or carts by the crew at the end of the meal service,” the order read.The order dated April 12 stated that the airlines can serve pre-packed snacks, pre meals, packaged beverages as per their policies only for flights with a duration of two hours or more. However, the MoCA laid down the conditions for serving meals. It said that the tray set up, plates and cutlery in all classes should be completely disposable. It also said that none of the disposables should be re-used and used rotables should be thoroughly cleaned and disinfected before reusing them. Components in an aircraft that need to be roated or reused at frequent intervals are defined as rotables. The MoCA has asked all the operating crew to wear a fresh set of gloves for every meal or beverage service. It also asked the airlines to inform passengers about these amended norms by making announcements. “The service of inflight meals to be staggered among the adjacent seats as far as possible,” the order concluded.The Central government had restricted serving onboard meals after it resumed flying for the domestic sector in a phased manner. This was being done as a precautionary measure to avoid the spread of the Sars-CoV2 virus. However, on August 29, it allowed selling onboard meals which is a significant source of ancillary revenue for low-cost airlines. While for domestic flights, only pre-packed snacks and beverages were allowed, airlines operating international flights were allowed to serve hot meals and alcohol.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-meals-for-passengers-on-flights-below-2-hour-duration-aviation-ministry-101618232857488.html

While returning to their village, they stopped at Goshpada Teertham to bathe in the river.“When three of them went back to the town to get some snacks after the bath, the other three entered the water again. Apparently, one person, who did not realise the depth of the water at one of the spots in the river, drowned and the other two drowned while trying to rescue him,” the inspector said. Their friends returned later in the evening when the search to find their friends had begun. They told the police that their group had stopped there to take bath after watching a movie.Generally, water level in the river is not much in summer, but there are some spots in it where the depth is up to 20 feet, Murthy added.Locals alerted the police when they saw the men drown. Police reached the spot along with expert swimmers; however, they could not locate the victims as it was getting dark.“We retrieved the bodies this afternoon and sent them to the local government hospital for post-mortem. We have booked a case of accidental death and are investigating,” the inspector added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/3-drown-in-godavari-waters-in-andhra-pradesh-101618231477440.html
12-04-2021||India||Sputnik V, ‘world's first' Covid-19 vaccine, gets experts' nod in India. All you need to know||Russia's Sputnik V, the first Covid-19 vaccine to receive regulatory approval from any country in the world, has now received a recommendation for emergency use in India against the deadly coronavirus disease. The vaccine, first approved in Russia on August 11 last year, was on Monday recommended for emergency use in India by the Subject Expert Committee (SEC) of the country's drug authority Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO). The Drug Controller General of India (DCGI) will take the final call on the recommendation, and if approved, the Russian vaccine will become the third Covid-19 vaccine to be available in India.Here's all you need to know about the 'Sputnik V' vaccine:Why is the vaccine named Sputnik V?The Sputnik V vaccine was named after Sputnik 1, the world's first artificial Earth satellite, launched by the erstwhile Soviet Union on October 4, 1957. The word "sputnik" is Russian for satellite when interpreted in an astronomical context and its other meanings are a spouse or traveling companion. The "V" in the name is the letter V and stands for "vaccine", and is not the Roman numeral for five.Who developed the Sputnik V vaccine?The vaccine is developed by the Gamaleya Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology, a medical research institute headquartered in Moscow. The development of the vaccine is backed by the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RIDF) and it was registered by the Russian health ministry as Gam-COVID-Vac. In India, the vaccine is being marketed by Dr Reddy's Laboratories, which has helped run a small trial for the drug in the country to test its safety and ability to generate an immune response, according to Reuters.How does the Sputnik V vaccine work?Sputnik V is an adenovirus viral vector vaccine. It uses a modified virus which cannot replicate and has instead been inserted with the spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2, to elicit an immune response in the body. According to the Russian health ministry, what makes this vaccine unique is that, unlike other similar vector-based vaccines, Sputnik V is a 'two-vector vaccine', meaning it uses two different types of adenovirus vectors -- rAd26 for the first shot, and rAd5 for the second -- for enhanced efficiency. The two vaccine shots are given to the Covid-19 patient three weeks apart.Why did Sputnik V initially face criticism?Sputnik V briefly courted controversies when Russia became the first country to grant it regulatory approval last year, a time when none of the pharmaceutical companies working on a potential Covid-19 vaccine in the United States and Europe had completed all the stages of their clinical trials. The 'vaccine race', not unlike the Cold War space race, was being closely observed by global watchdogs with much interest, and the competition to have the first vaccine was very much about international rivalries as much as it was about science.Russia, as it turned out, did not get to enjoy a "Sputnik moment" after all, unlike the awe and wonder of the Soviet Union's launch of the first satellite, of the same name, in 1957. Instead, it was met by doubts about science and safety. Leading science journals precipitated discussions in the community on how, if at all, the decision for approval was justified, as the Phase-I clinical trials for the vaccine were known to have started on June 17 and the final stages were reportedly completed in less than two months, by August 2.The process usually takes several more months to go through, reports noted.US infectious disease specialist Dr Anthony Fauci went on record to say, "I do hope the Chinese and the Russians are actually testing the vaccines before they are administering the vaccine to anyone. Because claims of having a vaccine ready to distribute before you do testing is problematic, at the very least."However, the speculations were put to rest on February 2, 2021, when an interim analysis from the trial was published in The Lancet medical journal, indicating 91.6% efficacy without unusual side effects.What's next for Sputnik V?The 'Sputnik V' vaccine has already been approved for use and mass distribution in more than 50 countries including Argentina, Belarus, Hungary, the United Arab Emirates and Serbia, in addition to Russia, according to a PTI report. The Russian Direct Investment Fund has signed deals to produce more than 750 million doses of Sputnik V with six domestic firms in India, where a massive second wave of the coronavirus is running high amid surging demands for vaccines. Most panel recommendations are generally accepted by the regulator's chief, Reuters said, and once approved, the vaccine will join other shots from the AstraZeneca-Oxford University and Bharat Biotech in the country's nationwide inoculation drive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sputnik-v-gets-experts-nod-in-india-all-you-need-to-know-about-the-vaccine-101618222753455.html

The EC is yet to react to the HC’s directive.The petitioners have welcomed the HC verdict. “We are happy the court upheld our rights,” said one of the petitioners and CPI(M) legislator S Sharma. The single bench headed by Justice PV Asha delivered the verdict on two petitions filed by CPI(M) legislator S Sharma and the secretary of the legislative assembly SV Unnikrishnan Nair. The court, in its verdict, observed that the sitting legislative assembly has the right to elect members of the seats falling vacant in the upper house. It is not immediately known whether the EC will approach the Supreme Court to challenge the HC verdict. The court has rejected EC’s contention that voting can be done after the constitution of the new assembly and observed that current members of the legislative assembly will have the right to vote. Earlier, the CPI(M) legislator and the secretary of the assembly had moved the court challenging the EC’s decision to keep in abeyance election to three Rajya Sabha seats.Three RS members - Abdul Wahab (Muslim League), KK Ragesh (CPI(M) and Vayalar Ravi (Cong) - will retire this month. Going by the present strength of the house, the ruling Left Democratic Front will get two and Congress-led UDF one seat.Also read: Kerala Police’s vaccination advisory with Boney M’s Rasputin twist goes viralThe EC maintained that since elections were over, three seats can be filled by the new assembly which was challenged by the CPI(M). Earlier, the ED had proposed elections on April 12 but it was later deferred citing the assembly elections. It maintained that there was no obligation to hold elections during the term of the present assembly but petitioners challenged it saying it was an encroachment on their rights.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-hc-directs-ec-to-hold-poll-for-rajya-sabha-seats-before-may-2-101618229137541.html
12-04-2021||India||Why is India seeing Covid-19 second wave? AIIMS chief Randeep Guleria explains||India's second wave of the coronavirus disease has been aggravated by lack of adherence to Covid-appropriate safety protocols and the circulation of highly infectious strains of SARS-CoV-2, All India Institute of Medical Sciences’ (AIIMS’) director Dr Randeep Guleria said on Monday.The coronavirus crisis, torpedoing economies and burdening medical infrastructure, worsened at the end of February in India and the country has since been reporting record Covid-19 cases every day. India on Monday shattered its previous daily spikes in Covid-19 cases recorded since the pandemic hit the country. On Monday, India saw the biggest single-day jump of 1,68,912 fresh Covid-19 infections, pushing the cumulative tally to 1,35,27,717, according to Union health ministry data.Also read: HT Editorial | Stop public rallies, nowIndia's Covid-19 crisis is unfolding in primarily 10 states, which account for 83.02% of the cases reported in the last 24 hours, according to the Union ministry of health and family welfare. These states—Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, Chhattisgarh, Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and Rajasthan—have imposed several curbs and restrictions to break the chain of transmission of the cases.Guleria pointed out that the infection rate has surged and the disease outbreak is compounded by the presence of highly infectious strains. "Earlier, if one sick person was able to infect around 30 per cent of their contacts, this time those getting the disease are infecting a larger number of people,” Guleria told PTI.People are taking the disease lightly now, the chief of India's premier hospital said. "If you go out, you see that marketplaces, restaurants and shopping malls are crowded and full of people and these all are super-spreader events," Guleria said. "Around February, when cases started to decrease, people became lax towards following Covid-appropriate behaviour as they thought the virus had become ineffective… So, the rate of spread of the infection is fast possibly due to the highly infectious and transmissible strains circulating,” he said.Guleria called everyone to stay home saying, "unless it is important, people should not venture out.Also read: Sputnik V, ‘world's first' Covid-19 vaccine, gets experts' nod in India. All you need to knowHe also said stricter enforcement of Covid-appropriate behaviour has to be ensured to ensure the progress made by India in the last year does not go to waste."We may lose the gains we have made so far if we do not pay heed now and the situation may completely get out of control. If the situation is not reversed, then the galloping infection rate will eventually cause a huge strain on the healthcare system also," he told PTI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/why-is-india-seeing-covid-19-second-wave-aiims-chief-randeep-guleria-explains-101618224239329.html

The Centre should provide vaccines and Remdesivir to Maharashtra. Everyone has seen how Remdesivir is available in BJP offices in Gujarat but it is not (made) available to Maharashtra," Raut claimed.He said Maharashtra BJP leaders must condemn these attempts to "malign the image of the state", or else they have "no business to do politics in the state".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sanjay-raut-blames-centre-for-rising-covid-19-cases-in-maharashtra-chhattisgarh-punjab-101618227499031.html

"Due to thunderstorm activities over most parts of the country, no significant change in maximum temperatures are likely over most parts of the country during next 4-5 days,” the met department said.Scattered to fairly widespread rainfall with thunderstorm, lightning and gusty winds of 30-40 kilometres per hour are very likely over southwest peninsular India in the next five days under the influence of trough and cyclonic circulations over the south peninsula, IMD said. It also said that isolated heavy rainfall is likely over southern and ghat areas of Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Mahe, coastal and south interior Karnataka during April 14-16.It also said that another cyclonic circulation lies over southwest Madhya Pradesh and neighbouring areas. Isolated rainfall with thunderstorm, lightning and gusty winds (30-40 kmph) is very likely over Madhya Pradesh, Vidarbha, Telangana, Chhattisgarh, Gangetic West Bengal and Odisha during next four to five days and over Jharkhand during the next 24 hours.The IMD said a fresh active western disturbance is very likely to affect the western Himalayan region and adjoining plains during April 15-17.

Enough with the festival, claps, and plates now provide vaccines to the country,” Gandhi tweeted along with a video making the appeal.Rahul Gandhi was referring to last year’s Janata curfew on March 22 when people clapped and banged utensils to thank healthcare and frontline workers on the day. The Congress leader also mentioned the ongoing Tika Utsav or the vaccine festival, which Prime Minister Narendra Modi suggested to states to ensure optimum utilisation of their Covid-19 vaccination capability.“Modiji, you said the fight against Corona will be won in 18 days. You made people ring bells, bang plates, turn on their mobile’s flashlight but Corona kept advancing. A second wave is here now and lakhs of people have fallen prey to it. Stop with the ‘Eventbaazi’ and provide vaccines to everyone who needs it and stop the export of vaccines,” he added.Gandhi also asked for financial assistance for those who have been hit by the second wave of the pandemic. “Our poor brothers and sisters should be given income support,” he said. On April 9, he wrote a letter to the Prime Minister on the state of vaccination in the country and urged the Centre to put an immediate halt to vaccine exports and involve the states as a stakeholder in the vaccination drive.Earlier in the day, Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra urged people to “speak up for vaccines for all” and criticised the government for exporting vaccines instead of vaccinating its citizens. “Because the vaccine is for everyone. Because the government should pay more attention to the public than organising the events. Because everyone has the right to know where the PM Care funds are being spent. Because instead of exporting the vaccine, the government should focus on vaccinating every citizen," Priyanka Gandhi tweeted.The Congress party on Monday launched its online campaign, urging Indians to demand vaccination for everyone.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/enough-with-festival-claps-and-plates-rahul-gandhi-urges-vaccination-for-all-101618225004023.html
12-04-2021||India||Something wrong if lawyers don’t want to be HC judges due to retirement age: SC||There is something wrong in their thinking if lawyers do not want to become judges because of the retirement age, observed the Supreme Court on Monday while rejecting a plea on increasing retirement age of high court judges from 62 to 65. A bench, headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde, was amused when petitioner in the case, Ashwini Upadhyay, submitted that he knew “some very fine lawyers” who did not want to become judges in the high courts because the retirement age was 62. “What are you saying? There is something wrong in their thinking of they don’t want to become judges... And you call them the finest lawyers!” commented the bench, which also included justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian. Bharatiya Janata Party leader and lawyer Upadhyay had filed a public interest litigation (PIL), seeking appropriate direction to the Union government for increasing the retirement age of high court judges from 62 to 65. The judges in the Supreme Court retire at 65. Also Read | Plea in SC seeks direction to Centre to open vaccinations for all citizensUpadhyay, during the hearing on Monday, said that since a high court is also a constitutional court like the Supreme Court, there should be uniformity in their retirement age. “Both are constitutional courts and are also the courts of record. The Supreme Court as well as the high courts are the protector of the fundamental rights. The judges of both courts also take similar oath of office. Why should high courts judges retire early? Let there be uniformity,” he said. The bench asked Upadhyay if he had consulted the judges in the high courts whether they wanted to be retired at 65 instead of 62. “Have you asked them? How are you concerned? Why do you want the retirement age to go up?” it asked Upadhyay. The lawyer replied that having the difference in the retirement age appeared to be irrational but the court disagreed. “How is this irrational? There is a provision in the Constitution which has fixed the age of retirement. There has to be some reason for it. You cannot simply say it is irrational,” remarked the bench. Upadhyay then sought to withdraw the petition with the liberty to move his plea as a representation with the Law Commission of India. The court, however, declined to accede to this plea either. “You have also filed a petition in this court to fill up the vacancy in the Law Commission and make it functional. Once you succeed in that petition, you can go to the Law Commission,” it said. Upadhyay’s PIL had stated that uniformity in the retirement age was not only necessary to reduce pendency of cases but also essential to attract and retain the best legal talent in the bench. “If there was uniformity in retirement age, the judges of the high court will discharge judicial work more independently and without any expectation to move to the Supreme Court,” it submitted.The PIL added that to minimise the apprehension of subordination between the Supreme Court and high courts also, it was appropriate to equate the retirement age of high court judges with that of the Supreme Court judges.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/something-wrong-if-lawyers-don-t-want-to-be-hc-judges-due-to-retirement-age-sc-101618223977966.html

In an earlier meeting, the subject expert committee (SEC) of the central drugs standard organisation (CDSCO) sought more data from Dr Reddy’s labs, which is conducting bridging clinical trials for the Russia-made Covid-19 vaccine locally. The vaccine’s efficacy is pegged at91.6% based on the final control point of clinical trials in Russia.Sputnik V was the next front-runner for approval in India, after Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin that is co-developed by Indian Council of Medical Research, and Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine that is locally manufactured by Serum Institute of India under the brand name Covishield.Also Read | Sputnik maker ties up with Indian firm to produce 100 mn dosesBoth the vaccines are currently approved for use in India for the national Covid-19 immunisation programme.

The central bank also noted that the National Electronic Fund Transfer (NEFT) services will continue to remain operational during this period.“A technical upgrade of RTGS, targeted to enhance the resilience and to further improve the Disaster Recovery Time of the RTGS system, is scheduled after the close of business of April 17, 2021. Accordingly, RTGS service will not be available from 00:00 hrs to 14.00 hrs on Sunday, April 18, 2021. The NEFT system will continue to be operational as usual during this period,” a statement from RBI said.RBI also asked the member banks to notify the customers, asking them to plan their transactions accordingly. “Member banks may inform their customers to plan their payment operations accordingly. RTGS Members will continue to receive event update(s) through system broadcasts,” it said in the statement.On April 7, the central bank allowed for the direct membership of non-bank payment system operators in the Centralised Payment Systems (CPS). Until then, RTGS and NEFT were allowed only for banks and specialised entities like clearing corporations and select development financial institutions. However, after the announcement, non-bank entities like Prepaid Payment Instrument (PPI) issuers, Card Networks, White Label ATM (WLA) operators, Trade Receivables Discounting System (TReDS) platforms would also be enabled to take direct membership in CPS.The move is intended to “encourage the participation of non-banks across payment systems,” a statement from RBI announcing the decision said.“This facility is expected to minimise settlement risk in the financial system and enhance the reach of digital financial services to all user segments.

We cannot interfere now. The government has already made the decision."The plea filed by the Envitech Marine Consultants Private Ltd stated that the company wanted to preserve the ship as a maritime museum.It said INS Viraat was sold to Shree Ram shipbreakers for ₹38 crore after it was decommissioned and added that the company offered upto ₹100 crores to buy the warship from the Shree Ram ship breakers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-dismisses-plea-against-dismantling-of-ins-viraat-aircraft-carrier-101618220913084.html

After Covishield and Covaxin, this will become the third Covid-19 vaccine to be used in the country if it is given a go-ahead by the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI).Dr Reddy's Laboratories, the Hyderabad-based pharmaceutical company, last week sought the government's approval for the vaccine to be used in India. The Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) partnered with Dr Reddy's in September 2020 to conduct clinical trials of Sputnik V in India. The Russian vaccine has an efficacy of 91.6% based on the interim analysis of phase III clinical trials, which included data from 19,866 volunteers in Russia. and is conducting its Phase III clinical trials in the UAE, India, Venezuela and Belarus, according to the Sputnik-V's website.Along with Dr Reddy’s, RDIF partnered with Hyderabad-based Virchow Biotech Private Limited in March to produce up to 200 million doses per year of Sputnik V in India, according to news agency PTI. It has also partnered with Stelis Biopharma Pvt Ltd and Panacea Biotec earlier in April as well to produce 200 million and 100 million doses per year of Sputnik V in the country.The makers of the vaccine claim Sputnik-V is an affordable vaccine and can be "stored at a temperature of +2 to +8°C ". They say that these aspects of Sputnik-V allow for fast distribution of the vaccine in hard-to-reach regions across the globe.The move to approve Sputnik-V by the Subject Expert Committee (SEC) comes as India faces a surge in Covid-19 cases across the nation with Maharashtra, Punjab, Karnataka, Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Karnataka and Kerala witnessing a surge in their daily caseload. India launched its vaccination drive on January 16 with Covaxin of Bharat Biotech and the vaccine developed by Oxford University-AstraZeneca, which is being manufactured as Covishield by the Serum Institute of India, after they were granted emergency use approval on January 1 and January 3 respectively.India has vaccinated 10.45 crore people according to data published by the Union health ministry on Monday. The government has declared a vaccine festival from April 11 to April 14. On Day 1 of Tika Utsav, the government said 30 lakh doses were administered.(with inputs from Rhythma Kaul)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-approves-russia-s-covid-19-vaccine-sputnik-v-101618220595374.html

You are saying that everything is alright. But, the reality is contrary to that," the high court said during the hearing held via video-conferencing.There is a "trust deficit" among people, it observed."There is no shortage of Remdesivir (key anti-viral drug). Everything is available with you. We want results, not reasons," the HC said, on complaints of shortage of Remdesivir injections for Covid-19 patients.It now takes "almost five days" for a person to get the RT-PCR test result, the court noted."You did not upscale the testing facilities when you had time," the HC said.Gujarat reported 5,469 new cases of coronavirus on Sunday, its biggest single-day rise since the beginning of the pandemic, which took its caseload to 3,47,495.The death toll due to the virus went up to 4,800 as 54 patients succumbed to the infection on Sunday, as per the state health department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/reality-different-from-state-government-s-claims-gujarat-hc-on-covid-19-situation-101618218831470.html
12-04-2021||India||Insurgencies are distinct from wars. India needs new strategy to battle Maoists||Colonel Harry Summers, a Vietnam veteran and author, once recounted a conversation he had with his North Vietnamese Army counterpart a week before the fall of Saigon. He said, “You know, you never beat us Americans on the battlefield.” “That may be so”, the NVA colonel replied. “but it is also irrelevant”.Conventional wars pivot around geographical resources. Be it capture of a ground of tactical importance, or victory at a theatre level, conventional war aims to destroy the enemy’s troops & resources and dominate areas previously controlled by the enemy. That is the pattern of conventional wars.An insurgency, on the other hand, is a competition between the insurgent and the government or support of the local population. Superior kinetic energy and operational intelligence enabled Americans to win almost every battle in Vietnam but that very force and ruthlessness alienated the population, losing their support. That is why the NVA won the war, even though it lost most battles in purely military terms.What makes an insurgency differentThe centre of gravity in an insurgency is always the local population because an insurgency is essentially a political movement. It is a violent process by which at least a section of the population seeks to achieve “just cause”, which they feel the State denies them through the normal political process. As the proportion of dissatisfied section increases, they indoctrinate or coerce the remainder to their cause. A “just cause” therefore is the principal requirement of any insurgency. The second is inherent weaknesses of the State. Its inability to address the cause of the population, ignoring the ramifications, not only failing to nip the insurgency at the nascent stage, but also aggravating it by using only force are necessary conditions for an insurgency to mature to a level where the latter seeks pitched battles with State forces.Also Read | Maoist challenge: Why large armies lose small warsParadoxically, an insurgency environment is the opposite of a conventional war which most security forces are trained for. Conventional conflicts are shorter, more intense and have decisive instances where one side can bring overwhelming force to deliver the knockout blow. Insurgencies foment for decades, waxing and waning but never entirely disappearing until the last stage is successfully achieved by either the insurgent, when they attain their objectives, as in the case of Nepal, to a partial extent or the movement is exterminated by the State, as in the case of some insurgencies in the Northeast.Conventional war is relatively unidimensional, where armed forces seek to destroy the enemy, political leaders facilitate the environment during the war and negotiate terms at the end of it. Counter-insurgency, however, is smorgasbord of kinetic operations, developmental programmes, propaganda, political jousting and even some stakeholders who benefit from status quo and thus work at counter purposes, all acting out simultaneously.The battle between order and disorder But the most important difference is that an insurgency unlike conventional war, is a battle between order and disorder.The rules of conventional war are equally applicable to both sides. However, in an insurgency, the contestants fight by rules that are not applicable to the other. As David Galula, the French scholar warrior puts it, in a fight between a fly and a lion, the fly cannot deliver a knockout blow and the lion cannot fly. It’s the same war in terms of time and space, but different warfares for the two contestants. While at the tactical level, the State can copy the insurgents as the Russians did in Afghanistan by inducting the Spetznaz (Special Forces who moved in small teams living off the land, much like the Taliban) or the employment of greyhounds in Andhra, at the strategic level, the State, by definition, cannot use instruments of intimidation or disorder.The insurgent’s objective is to create disorder and challenge the State’s writ. He can do so easily using intimidation, bombing, assassinations or public executions. It’s much easier to create disorder than order. This handicaps the State, because its mandate is to maintain order which is more laborious and time consuming. If insurgents calls for a bandh, all they have to do is carry out a few exemplar executions. If the State wants the population to defy the bandh, it has to provision far more resources, political clout, assurances of safety and incentives. Also Read | Days after Bijapur ambush, Maoists set CRPF commando freeThat is the Achilles’ heel of the State because unlike the insurgents who can make good on their threat in a matter of hours, the State has to rely on promises of a better future. When faced with the choice of life and State propaganda, the constituent population will choose the former.The challenges of counter-insurgency The doctrine of counter-insurgency warfare is mature. Building on the work of thinkers like David Galula, Sir Robert Thompson and of course own experiences, Indian security forces know what to do. The devil, of course, lies in the fact that this is not a war that can be won using only force, or within a short time or without collateral damage.The classical counter-insurgency model — some variant of which is followed by all countries — has eight broad phases. It begins with destruction or expulsion of the insurgent’s armed forces, deployment of static security units in sanitised areas to prevent the re-entry of insurgents, control of the local population to identify sympathisers and ideological leaders, destruction of the insurgent’s political organisation, holding local elections, testing and empowering the local leaders, organising a formal political party and finally winning over or suppressing the remnants of the guerrilla.In these eight steps, only the first two (and to some extent the last) are addressable by security forces. The remaining six require intense administrative and political participation. The first two steps are the hammer and the remaining phases act as an anvil. Increasing the size of the hammer achieves little if the anvil is weak. The advocates of giving security a “free hand” miss this point. No matter how many more boots are placed on ground, winning the territory from the insurgents and winning the population within the territory, are two different strategies which require completely different skill sets.The first phase requires lightly armed infantry-based troops who will attack insurgent strongholds and wrest back control of territory. Phase two requires paramilitary which will set up pickets in the freed territory to prevent them from returning. They also provide the vanguard of intelligence gathering, control of the population and other rehabilitation efforts. However, the tipping point can only be achieved when the constituent population is convinced about enduring victory of the State over the insurgents and making good on the promises made by the former. This requires politicians, administrators, policymakers, activists and the security forces to work in congruence, which is a challenge for many reasons.Also Read | HT Editorial: Maoists cross a red line, againTake the Maoist problem, for instance. A myriad of state and central forces are deployed in a swathe of area that falls under several different administrative borders. Unless there is synchronicity of command, operations in one theatre will merely push the insurgents into another theatre, an example being security forces’ action in Andhra which drove Maoist cadres to less dangerous states or underground, but did not exterminate them. Secondly, the constituent population is unsurprisingly suspicious of government assurances and more scared of the insurgents. This is exacerbated by frequent changes in the last mile connectors of the government machinery. Building intelligence networks, identifying potential leaders, inspiring confidence to participate in a political process, rebuilding of infrastructure and communication etc., all require continuity of policy, command and implementors. That is rarely the case. Policies are switched, priorities and leaders changed and resources diverted from one operation to the other, frequently. The third challenge is that many constituents of the counter-insurgency operations work at seeming cross purposes. The security forces may arrest an insurgent sympathiser at great risk only to find the politicians intervene on his behalf or judiciary release him within hours. But that is necessary if the government is seen to be lenient and fair. An iron treatment only plays into the hands of the insurgent’s narrative. Similarly, any excess of force by security personnel has to be punished exemplarily to instil confidence in the State’s jurisprudence without which there is no possibility of population’s support. However, security forces will see this as a curb on their efficiency and fight it tooth and nail.Focus on winning tactical battles obfuscates the desired end of war. Revenge reprisals, heavy militarisation, population control measures such as identity cards and curfews can never pummel the population into supporting the government. At best, the people will go through the motions, and at worst, opportunity seekers who wish to ingratiate themselves with the State, will get power, thus further maligning the State’s reputation of unfair play.Getting to the core cause The only possible and desirable end to an insurgency is to negotiate the elements of its core cause. A best-case scenario is to reduce the military power of the insurgents while simultaneously elevating the political moderates, thus assuring the population that their representation is better done by the latter than the former. To achieve this, the State has to execute a delicate, well timed and synchronised strategy.First, it has to limit the security forces’ operations to the minimum and focused on the hardcore elements of the insurgents. Unfortunately, getting to the core requires pressure on a scared or participative population which in turn further alienates them. Once an area is freed of insurgents, the situation should transfer to civilian administration at the earliest. However, in most cases, the civilian rebuilding tasks are handed over to the security forces, thus increasing their engagement and dichotomy. A villager doesn’t forgive a soldier who interrogated his son, just because he helped build a school in the village.Also Read | ‘Jawans are not cannon fodder’: Rahul Gandhi days after Chhattisgarh attackSecondly, transition from the security phase to the building phase requires very different skill sets. In a war-like situation, a soldier is trained to retaliate with all his firepower if he is fired upon. In an insurgency, the very opposite is needed. To paraphrase Galula, an internet connection may be more useful than a machine gun, a soldier trained as a paediatrician more important than a weapons expert, cement more wanted than barbed wire and a soft-spoken multi-lingual empathetic officer far more effective than a badass one from the Special Forces.Thirdly, this transition necessitates immaculate timing. Played too soon, the insurgency comes back with a vigour and playing too late, alienates the population and prolongs their trauma. Also, the build phase must be implemented with a sense of urgency, because the credibility of the state depends on it. This is where three major flaws of the state machinery — credibility, inefficiency and corruption —create massive faultlines.Politicians and administration have a poor reputation of keeping promises even among their own voters. For their own reasons, political leaders often make promises which they are not able to keep, at least in totality or within the timeline promised. When coupled with the inefficiency and corruption quotient of any administrative organisation, the government invariably comes short on its promises, thus reiterating the insurgent’s narrative. The gap between propaganda and reality is the operating ground of the insurgent.Unlike terrorism, insurgency is an easier beast to contain, even if it might be more difficult to defeat. Terror can be carried out by a small group of people like 9/11 or 26/11 who might be rogue elements within their own organisations. Insurgency on the other hand, has an ideological and military centre of gravity, an area under contest which the insurgent eventually intends to hold as a bargaining chip, safe haven or a launchpad for expansion.A five-pronged strategy Which is where the State can create some advantages using this five-pronged strategy.Firstly, the State needs to accept and educate the citizenry that the Maoist insurgency cannot be solved with swift military options. It has taken decades to mature and will take time to be resolved completely. This timeline enables the state to design long-term reforms rather than short term scorecards.Secondly, there is no skirting the “just cause”, which is the pivot of the insurgent movement. Thrusting down fiats will never eradicate the cause. Agreeing to the acceptable elements of the just cause is the only way to remove the locus standi of the insurgent. Unless that is done, the seeds of dissent will continue to foment and the State will pay a price in perpetuity. That is usually the most insurmountable challenge especially in an environment of extreme inequity in developing countries like India. Inequity is the root of all revolutionary movements. There has to be genuine dissent to compel people including women to take up arms, live a life of extreme discomfort, and risk to life. Denying that is delusional, self-serving and in the end, self-defeating.Thirdly, while the security forces have to be subjugated to the political administration (after all, insurgency is a political problem, not a military one), the political leader must be astute and educated about counter-insurgency at a strategic, not just at the operational military level. If the briefings are dominated by security operations without the accompanying social, political and infrastructure progress, then the first two phases are being prolonged – which is a victory for the insurgent.Also Read | Maoist attack: How Sikh jawan took off turban to help wounded colleagueThen, there is the problem of focus and continuity. While states have set up Maoist focussed security structures and commands, the political and administrative attention remains defused. While major instances like the recent one, seize the chief minister and prime minister’s mindshare and apparatuses, they are temporal in nature. A political crisis in state or Centre will push back this mindshare in an instant. There is need for a credible, strategically educated and empowered political leader who focusses on this issue relentlessly, on a long-term basis. Without this unified and broad-spectrum, long term command, tactical military successes will masquerade for victory.Fourthly, while there is no organisation without its share of inefficiency and corruption, in an insurgency, its implications are fatal for the state. The state’s forces and its administrative elements are fighting a moral battle against the insurgents. The insurgent’s high command ruthlessly enforces austerity and rules such as tobacco and alcohol abstinence, to reinforce this moral high ground as much as for disciplining the cadres. Every act of corruption on the part of the state’s representatives erodes the state’s moral ground and strengthens the insurgent’s cause. Corruption can range from excessive use of force, diversion of funds, partisan decisions or misreporting ground reality. Each of these and several more examples must be equated to high treason, because they undermine the state and derail its strategic intent. This is why the participation of neutral observers is essential. Without it, the political high command has no visibility of the reality which will be invariably camouflaged by the functionaries for extended periods. Similarly, operational inefficiency must be removed ruthlessly. Unless the State implements a zero-tolerance attitude to material, moral and ethical corruption and punishes professional inefficiency – the constituent population will not support it. The last step will undoubtedly ruffle feathers among the State’s elements -- but it is a mandatory requirement and in the long run, boosts the morale of counter-insurgents as well.Also Read | Drone shows tractor trolleys used to carry up to 20 dead Maoists: OfficialsLastly, but most importantly, is the issue of reframing the mindset of the elements fighting insurgency. It is ironic that a battalion deputed for a United Nations mission in Congo will scurry around learning French and the social and cultural history of that country, but officers and men who are destined to spend at least half their career is Kashmir or Maoist areas will not bother to do the same for those regions. Military academies teach foreign languages to the cadets to prepare them for the one odd opportunity that some officers might get to serve abroad but don’t train them in the languages of the state that they will be baptized in professionally.There is no formal training for critical counter-insurgency skills such as deep knowledge of the local culture, languages, ethnic histories, social dynamics, negotiation skills and appreciating compulsions of the constituent population. As a result, the state’s elements deployed in insurgency areas view it as a “tour of duty” that must be endured, not a process they need to carry to a planned end. They view the constituent population in black and white. Those supporting them and everyone else. The latter unfortunately happens to be the majority, so the state’s forces begin the war by losing the most crucial battle, that of the population’s tacit support or neutrality. Galula prescribes an ideal counter-insurgency force as lightly armoured equipped with a surplus of interpreters, civil affair specialists, and engineers. I would add, psychologists, social scientists, NGO’s and corporate CSR efforts to that composite force.Our training establishments, ranging from the military to bureaucracy need to accord importance to the kind of warfare that our next generation of soldiers and administrators will encounter. Despite having two nuclear powered and heavily armed nations as our adversaries, we have been engaged in small wars for the last four decades. Yet our instructional syllabuses bask in the yesteryears narratives of theatre level battles and wargames. Not a single institution conducts training wargames of counter-insurgency in totality. Sure, the military and paramilitary establishments have training capsules on counter insurgency operations (COINS) but they are limited to tactical exercises like cordon and search and roadblock drills. Where is the training of winning over the population, of negotiation, of joint-manship between the security forces and the bureaucracy? Who indeed can even act as Red Land or genuinely represent the population in that notional wargame?It is an irony that respective premier institutes which train the military and administrative officers of our country are located 25 kms to each other as the crow flies and yet they meet for meaningful collaborative training after 25 years of service in the National Defence College. The biggest hurdle to the battle against counter-insurgency is the lack of imaginative strategic thinking. And that is why a few hundred flies can run circles around the lion for decades.In 1917, Thomas Edward, a young maverick British officer was tasked to conduct an irregular campaign against the Turks in Arabia. Thomas went on to create a guerrilla operation that became the stuff of legends, and was so lethal that he felt sorry for his victims recording their plight in his memoirs titled the Seven Pillars of Wisdom. He wrote, that the guerrillas were like vapour, appearing at will, and congealing in front of the enemy, striking them and disappearing like a ghost. He sympathised with the Turks, remarking that “war on rebellion is messy business, like eating soup with a knife”. Thomas Edward Lawrence, better known as Lawrence of Arabia, couldn’t have described the war on Maoists any better.Raghu Raman was the founding CEO of NatgridThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/insurgencies-are-distinct-from-wars-india-needs-new-strategy-to-battle-maoists-101618219176902.html

Seers of Ananda Akhada also took bath along with them. They were followed by the Joona Akhada saints led by Acharya Kailashanand. Former King of Nepal Gyanendra Bir Bikram Shah was also among those who took a dip in the Ganga on the occasion. It was his maiden visit to Haridwar.It was the second Shahi Snan during the ongoing Kumbh Mela which has been limited to just one month due to the rising cases of coronavirus. The last Shahi Snan or royal bath was conducted on the occasion of Mahashivratri on March 11.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kumbh-mela-thousands-take-dip-in-ganga-on-shahi-snan-on-day-india-reports-1-6-lakh-covid-19-cases-101618216810747.html

Ltd.) and COVISHIELD (produced by Serum Institute of India Ltd.), while other vaccines are also pending authorization for immunization, it added.The plea further stated, both the vaccines have been found to be effective against Covid-19 disease and may provide adequate protection from the disease on successful administration of two doses of the vaccines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/plea-in-supreme-court-seeks-direction-to-centre-to-open-vaccinations-for-all-citizens-101618216823786.html
12-04-2021||India||'Absolutely frivolous': Supreme Court on plea for removing 26 verses of Quran||The Supreme Court Monday termed as "absolutely frivolous" a petition filed by former UP Shia Waqf Board chairman Waseem Rizvi seeking removal of 26 verses from holy Quran and dismissed it with a cost of ₹50,000.A bench of Justices RF Nariman, BR Gavai and Hrishikesh Roy rejected the petition in which Rizvi alleged that these 26 verses of Quran promoted terrorism.In his plea, Rizvi has stated that Islam is based on the concepts of equity, equality, forgiveness and tolerance but due to extreme interpretations of the said verses of the holy book, the religion has been drifting away from the basic tenets.The plea of Rizvi has drawn massive backlash with several Muslim outfits and Islamic clerics protesting against the former chairman of the Waqf Board.Last month, an FIR was registered in Bareilly against Rizvi for allegedly hurting religious sentiments of Muslims with his petition in the top court.The FIR was registered at the Kotwali police station following complaints by Anjuman Khuddam-e-Rasool secretary Shan Ahmed and an organisation known as Ittehad-e-Millat council.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/absolutely-frivolous-supreme-court-on-plea-for-removing-26-verses-of-quran-101618216038198.html
12-04-2021||India||India sees job losses as fresh curbs comes into effect in states||indiaA fresh round of provincial lockdowns to curb the record rise in virus infections is leading to job losses in India, according to the latest employment data by a private research firm.Unemployment touched 8.6% for the week ending April 11, from 6.7% two weeks ago, showed the data by Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy Pvt. Ltd. The hit is more severe in urban areas where it’s nearing 10% as local media shows images of workers fleeing cities fearing harsher curbs like last year.Asia’s third-largest economy is potentially on track to regain the second spot from Brazil after adding a record 168,912 cases in a day, taking the tally to 13.53 million cases. It is facing an escalating health crisis with the second wave overwhelming hospitals and forcing states to restrict activities.While wealthiest Maharashtra, the worst hit by the virus, is contemplating more curbs after announcing a strict weekend lockdown, national capital Delhi, which is operating under a night curfew, has warned of more restrictions if its medical facilities collapse.The pandemic had led to record job losses in India after a national lockdown last year saw millions of migrants heading back to their villages, many of them walking miles without proper food and water. Some of the jobs came back as the economy reopened and infections surprisingly started receding.The resurgence of Covid-19 is worsening the outlook again with jobs last month falling at the quickest pace since September 2020, according to a survey of manufacturers by IHS Markit. The central bank’s consumer confidence survey is also showing increasing pessimism on jobs.Prolonged and widespread night curfews could possibly lead to “another bout of reverse migration,” said Kunal Kundu, an economist with Societe Generale GSC Pvt. in Bengaluru. “Job creation will remain a challenge.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-sees-job-losses-as-fresh-curbs-comes-into-effect-in-states-101618215144342.html
12-04-2021||India||SC slaps ₹50k fine on plea to remove Quran verses, says ‘absolutely frivolous’||The Supreme Court on Monday imposed a penalty of ₹50,000 on former chairman of Shia Waqf Board Syed Waseem Rizvi, who had sought the deletion of 26 verses from the Quran, which he claimes are used as “justifications” by Islamist terrorist groups for attacks on “non-believers”. “It is an absolutely frivolous petition,” a bench, headed by justice Rohinton F Nariman, said. The bench, which also included justices BR Gavai and Hrishikesh Roy, had already cautioned Rizvi’s lawyer against pressing the plea but the warning was unheeded, resulting in the penalty. “Do you seriously want to argue this petition? Are you going to press it?” the bench had asked senior advocate RK Raizada, appearing for Rizvi, who chose to make submissions instead of simply withdrawing the petition. Raizada submitted that the focus of the petition was the indoctrination of children in madrassas, which were unregulated and had been engaged in imparting “literal interpretation” of Quran. Also Read | Several staff members of Supreme Court test positive for Covid-19“These verses that I have cited in my petition are not protected under Article 25 (right to practise, profess and propagate religion). Islamist organisations use these verses as a tool to promote hatred and terror. They are used as justifications by Islamist terrorist groups for attacks on non-believers,” argued Raizada. The bench, however, expressed displeasure at the contentions and junked the petition with a monetary fine. Saeed Noori, founding member of Raza Academy, which had filed a caveat in the Supreme Court for a hearing if Rizvi’s plea was to be entertained, expressed satisfaction at the dismissal of the petition. “As an organisation that promotes Islamic beliefs through publications and research, we wanted the mischievous petition to be dismissed with a penalty. The Supreme Court, by imposing the fine, has sent out a clear message that such any religious text cannot be maligned like this,” Noori told HT. Rizvi, in his plea, had alleged that certain verses in the Quran are a threat to the sovereignty, unity, and integrity of the country. He has sought a declaration from the court to hold those verses unconstitutional, non-effective and non-functional. The plea also sought directions to appoint a committee of religious experts to get an opinion on these verses, besides seeking the central government’s policy on the issue. Last month, the National Commission for Minorities (NCM) had issued a notice to Rizvi asking him to withdraw his comments on Quran failing which, it said, it will hold a hearing and direct authorities to take appropriate legal action against him. The NCM had observed that the remarks made by Rizvi appeared to be a well-thought conspiracy to disturb the communal harmony of the country.On Friday, the same bench in the Supreme Court had termed a petition by Bharatiya Janata Party leader and lawyer Aswhini Upadhyay that asked for a strict central law to check religious conversion as “very harmful”, and observed that adults are free to choose their faith. “There is a reason why the word ‘propagate’ is there in the Constitution. You have to have some meaning for that word. There is no reason why somebody above 18 cannot choose one’s own religion or somebody else’s religion,” justice Nariman had remarked while dismissing the plea.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-rejects-plea-to-delete-verses-from-quran-imposes-rs-50k-penalty-101618214676823.html
12-04-2021||India||Congress launches online campaign to seek Covid vaccine for all||The Congress on Monday launched its online campaign, #SpeakUpForVaccinesForAll, which urges Indians to demand Covid-19 vaccine for everyone.Days days after writing a letter to PM Narendra Modi about the “nation starved of Covid-19 vaccine”, former Congress president Rahul Gandhi shared a video about the campaign on Twitter. The minute-long video said the exponential rise in Covid-19 cases had led to an atmosphere of uncertainty within the country.Slamming the Centre for allegedly creating a shortage of vaccine stocks in the country by exporting them, it added that hundreds of vaccination centres across India had been out of stocks for weeks. “On behalf of all the Indians, the Congress demands vaccination of all the Indian nationals within a specific time. There should be a ban on the export of vaccines with immediate effect,” it said.Gandhi had earlier called the decision to export vaccines “an effort to garner publicity at the cost of our citizens”. In an appeal to the masses, the video asked all Indians to flood social media with their demand for vaccines by using the hashtag, #SpeakUpForVaccinesForAll. Last week, in a meeting with chief ministers, Prime Minister Modi defended the country’s vaccine strategy and added that vaccines would be distributed in priority areas.Slamming the Congress, he said, “Those who have the habit of doing politics, let them do so. I have faced criticism but have remained committed to serving the people.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-launches-online-campaign-to-seek-covid-vaccine-for-all-101618214376703.html

12-04-2021||India||Surge in Covid cases casts shadow on Bihu celebrations in Assam||Amid a surge in Covid-19 cases, a cloud of uncertainty hovers over Bohag Bihu or Rongali Bihu celebrations in Assam. The biggest festival in the state, which marks start of the Assamese New Year, begins this week. Bohag Bihu starts in mid-April and goes on for seven days, but cultural events, spread over two-three days, are organised in most major localities across the Brahmaputra , and continue for a month or so.Last year, the Covid-induced lockdown put a lid on cultural events which usually witness major performing artists and Bihu dance groups holding shows. With assembly elections getting over last week, the state government decided to allow celebrations this year, but with restrictions in place. As per the standard operating procedures (SOPs) issued on Friday require organisers of events to seek permission from local authorities and mention how many people are expected to take part. All organisers and volunteers will have to get themselves tested for Covid-19 three days prior to and also after the event. Also Read | Himanta Sarma defends ‘no need for mask’ comment, says Assam will celebrate BihuThe event sites should be spacious, kept open from all sides with adequate space for social distancing. There should be multiple entry and exit points and all visitors screened for fever. Use of face mask is mandatory and organisers will have to arrange for hand sanitisers. All functions, which usually continue till early mornings, will have to be wrapped by 11pm and the venues will have to be sanitised twice -- once before the event and again, after it is over. The guidelines haven’t gone down well with many Bihu organisers who have blamed to government for issuing them late, putting the entire burden of Covid-19 guidelines’ management on them. They have also questioned why such measures were not in place when campaigning for polls was underway barely days ago. “We had completed nearly 80% of work on conducting the functions, but the SOPs were issued this late and without consulting any organisers. We have reservations against several of the guidelines,” Pranab Goswami, general secretary of Sodou Asom Bihu Sanmilani Samanway Rakshi Samiti, the apex body of Bihu event organisers, told journalists on Sunday. “It won’t be possible to conduct Covid-19 tests of all organisers and volunteers so close to the functions. If that is forced on us, Bihu functions won’t be held. The time limit of 11pm also needs to be extended till 1am since most major artists take to the stage late at night,” he added. Members of Bihu organising committees in Guwahati also held a protest on Sunday, urging the authorities to either revoke the SOPs or alter some of the guidelines. The state government explained its stand. “There’s no lockdown or night curfew planned in Assam and we have even allowed Bihu celebrations even as some states have enforced night curfews. But we will be criticised [for laxity] if we allowed functions throughout the night,” health minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said on Sunday. “We have allowed Bihu celebrations as a challenge this time. Organisers and performing artists should appreciate the government’s stand. If I allow Bihu functions to continue throughout the night, the Central government will issue directives to put an end to all celebrations,” he added. Daily Covid-19 cases in Assam were down to single digits in March but the number shot up this month with Sunday recording 352 new cases. Currently, there are 1,902 active Covid-19 cases in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/surge-in-covid-casts-shadow-on-bihu-celebrations-in-assam-101618207717083.html

A decision has been taken at the highest level to ensure all steps are taken to help domestic manufacturers to scale up vaccine production manifold."The Government of India is determined to ensure India remains the pharmacy of the world and Indians have equitable access to the highest quality vaccines in the world.

The case couldn't move forward because Ansari was lodged in a jail in Punjab; he was brought to Uttar Pradesh earlier this month.There are 52 cases against Mukhtar Ansari in Uttar Pradesh, and the government hopes that many of these will see some movement now.Ansari will also appear at Punjab's Mohali court in connection with an extortion case, according to ANI.UP Police on April 7 brought Ansari, who is the sitting Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) MLA from Mau Vidhan Sabha seat to Banda prison, on the order of Supreme Court. He had spent over two years in Punjab prison.Since coming to Uttar Pradesh, Ansari has been complaining of a number of health-related issues. On Thursday, he complained of pain in the neck after which the hospital authorities called an ENT specialist, Hindustan Times' sister publication Livehindustan reported. The doctor detected sore throat and gave medicines accordingly.On Saturday, Mukhtar Ansari claimed of clouded vision. An eye specialist suggested getting a new pair of spectacles, according to Livehindustan.Last week, the Supreme Court adjourned the plea of his wife Afshan Ansari alleging 'grave threat' to the life of her husband. The court adjourned the matter as a letter for the same was already circulated by one of the parties in the case.Afshan, while alleging an imminent threat to Ansari's life, sought the intervention of the top court to ensure that her husband is not killed in a so-called fake encounter.The Supreme Court had on March 26 ordered that Ansari be shifted to an Uttar Pradesh jail from Punjab, keeping in view the fact that he is allegedly involved in many criminal cases.The Uttar Pradesh government had filed the petition in the top court seeking a direction to the Punjab government and Rupnagar jail authority to immediately hand over the custody of Ansari, to the district jail Banda.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mukhtar-ansari-to-appear-in-2-cases-virtually-today-from-banda-jail-101618201076230.html

With this (attitude) I made all such adversities cry)”: hundred-year-old Jai Dev Chowdhry quoted a nazm (verse) of poet Shaukat Ali Khan and said that a positive attitude in life could help people overcome the difficulties during the pandemic.Chowdhry was administered the first dose of the Serum Institute of India-manufactured Covishield at Medicover Hospitals, Madhapur on March 1. While he was scheduled to get the second dose on March 29, the government on March 22 increased the interval between the two doses from 28 days to 4-6 weeks.The ministry of health and family welfare took the decision on the recommendation of two expert groups – the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (NTAGI) and National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for Covid-19 (NEGVAC).Read more: Centre halts exports of Remdesivir amid rising Covid-19 casesBut, Chowdhry insists, he has faced bigger crisis than the apprehensions surrounding the vaccine.“I have gone through more difficult times and faced more pains during my life.

So, I happily got vaccinated and it only made me feel more positive,” Chowdhry, a retired businessman, said.His family runs Gemini Edibles and Fats India Pvt Ltd which produces the Freedom brand of refined oils.“There is no need to have any concerns about vaccination and its efficacy.

You cannot let your guard down completely,” Chowdhry said.Pradeep, who has also received the first dose of the vaccine, said that they only let people who have been vaccinated meet the 100-year-old. “Since the worst period is not yet over, we are a little cautious.

12-04-2021||India||New norms for thermal plants may dent India's emission targets: Experts||A new analysis by researchers shows that the new thermal power plant norms issued by the Union environment ministry last month, which allowed them flexibility in meeting certain criteria, could compromise India’s emission reduction goals that are part of efforts to tackle the climate crisis.The new rules, which came into effect on March 31, give an extension of 1 to 3 years to all thermal power plants to comply with emission norms that are mandated by the government.What makes it worse is that the penalty charged to companies for not complying with the extended deadline is even lower than the cost of complying with rules that are meant to reduce emissions, an analysis by the Centre for Science and Environment has found. This means that thermal power plants can continue to pollute by paying a lower price for not installing pollution control devices.Read more: Centre lays down plan to phase out single-use plastics by 2022CSE’s analysis released on Thursday shows that while installing the equipment for pollution control will cost between ₹40-100 lakh/MW, the penalty that a 500 MW thermal power plant will have to pay to keep running without installing the equipment is only ₹5-11 lakh/MW as per the new amendment.Similarly, the maximum penalty imposed on non-compliant thermal plants is 20 paise per unit of electricity. But the cost of retrofit of pollution control equipment to meet the new norms for these plants is estimated to be between 30 and 70 paise per unit of power generated.“The amended notification favours operation of old inefficient coal power stations, which can continue to run on paying a penalty – this can compromise India’s climate change goals. What is worse is that the deterrence penalty charged to companies for not complying with the emission norms in the extended deadline is in fact a license to pollute,” the CSE analysis said.Read more: ‘World’s two biggest democracies should join hands on confronting climate change’: John KerryA senior environment ministry official, however, said the cost of penalties will have to be borne by power companies but the cost of installing emission control devices can be passed on to the consumers. “The power ministry has already made provisions where the cost of compliance to new emission norms can be passed on to the consumer in the form of tariff but the penalty for not complying cannot be passed on, so this will be loss to the power generator. There are a limited number of suppliers of pollution control devices... [and] Covid also has caused delays. So we have tried to harmonise the process through this notification,” the senior environment ministry official said on condition of anonymity.The environment ministry’s notification dated March 31 replaces the Environment (protection) Rules, 1986, with the Environment (protection) Amendment Rules, 2021.It states that thermal power plants located within 10km radius of the National Capital Region (NCR) or cities with million-plus populations have to meet the emission norms by December 31, 2022. Thermal power plants within 10km radius of critically polluted areas or non-attainment cities (cities that did not meet the annual national standard for particulate matter emissions from 2011 to 2015) will have to meet the standards by December 31, 2023, it states. Thermal power plants that are not in these two categories and are not scheduled for retirement will have to meet the norms by December 31, 2024.Read more: India debates the net zero emission target— what is at stakeThe environment ministry had first notified superior emission standards for thermal power plants in December 2015 for implementation by the end of 2017. Later in 2017, this deadline was delayed to 2022 due to resistance from the industry. Last year, the Union power ministry approached the environment ministry requesting that the timeline to meet air quality norms be deferred on account of pandemic-linked economic slowdown and the inability to source flue gas desulphurization (FGD) systems, which help control sulphur dioxide (SO2) emissions. The environment ministry appears to have heeded to their demand.“The cost of non-compliance as per the new notification is miniscule compared to the cost of compliance, so why will companies comply?” asked Sunita Narain, director general, CSE.Read more: Centre limits states’ role in forest matters“Looking at the past track record of penalisation and stay (through courts) ensured by the non-complying power plants as well at the structure and formulation of current proposed penalty amount per unit of generation it is very evident that firstly it wouldn’t even be enforced and secondly rather than ensuring compliance, it will support non-compliance by polluting power plants in a power surplus market, where cost of non-compliance is negligible compared to amount they are paid as fixed costs,” said Sunil Dahiya, researcher at Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA).Over 40% of India’s greenhouse gas emissions come from its energy sector because of heavy dependence on coal, according to India’s biennial report to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/paying-emission-fines-cheaper-for-thermal-plants-than-following-norms-101618167373910.html
12-04-2021||India||‘Tika Utsav’ beginning of 2nd war against Covid-19: PM Modi||Terming it as the beginning of the second big war against the coronavirus pandemic, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday appealed for maximum inoculations among eligible age groups during the four-day ‘Tika Utsav’ and made several suggestions to keep the virus under check.Amid a rapid surge in Covid-19 cases, Modi, in his recent interaction with chief ministers, had proposed a four-day ‘Tika Utsav’ starting from Sunday to ensure maximum participants in the vaccination drive. At present, those above 45 years of age are eligible to get the anti-Covid shot.In a blog addressed to the citizens, Modi wrote: “The ‘Tika Utsav’ marks the beginning of the second war against Covid-19. We should vaccinate as many as eligible persons through a special campaign and decide on zero wastage.”“We have to move towards optimum utilisation of the country’s vaccination capacity. This is a way to augment our capacity,” he added.The Prime Minister also outlined four responsibilities for each citizen, including ‘each one, vaccinate one’, ‘each one, treat one’ and ‘each one, save one’.While ‘each one, vaccinate one’ suggested helping those who are less educated and the elderly who cannot go for the jab themselves, ‘each one, treat one’ hinted at assisting those who do not have the means or are not aware of the facilities available for vaccination. Through his message of ‘each one, save one’, the Prime Minister stressed on the importance of wearing masks to save oneself and also others. Highlighting the importance of establishing micro-containment zones in a densely-populated country like India, Modi urged everyone to focus on personal and social hygiene.“Our success will be determined by our awareness of the micro containment zone. Our success will be determined by not leaving the house when there is no need. Our success will also depend on whether we wear masks and follow other rules,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tika-utsav-beginning-of-2nd-war-against-covid-19-pm-modi-101618166716859.html
12-04-2021||India||Join the dots: The long-lasting impact of forest fires across India||From Uttaranchal to Nagaland, Madhya Pradesh to Odisha, Indian forests have burned away in the last six months, releasing the carbon sequestered for years.What gives? Each case is different. In Odisha, poachers and non-timber forest product collectors tend to set fires. In Madhya Pradesh, it could be deliberate human actions. In Nagaland’s Dzukou Valley, it’s unclear. And then, in Uttaranchal, multiple causes. This includes inflammable needles from pine trees planted during the colonial era, forest laws that inhibit removing pine trees, local alienation. In all cases, the lack of precipitation and intense heat-an outcome of climate change-is an exacerbating factor.Move to stubble burning in Punjab. It’s an annual environmental crises, where middle-class urbanites vilify farmers. Paddy stubble originates in ground water conservation in a dehydrated state. And Punjab is getting thirstier with heat stress.Join the dots to read the message. It’s clear climate change has an important role to play in both cases. Second, the policy framework needs rapid overhaul, so it is climate-adapted. For example, what prices can farmers expect for climate resilient crops? What legal modifications do local communities want around forests to shift the dynamic of conservation? Finally, the message is clear from those who tend to the soil and the forests : they don’t see other people-urban, middle class etc- as their allies for a secure future. But without building alliances and helping make their voices heard, we cannot expect to keep our desh ki dharti safe.(The writer is Founder and Director Chintan Environmental Research and Action Group)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/join-the-dots-the-long-lasting-impact-of-forest-fires-across-india-101618170196365.html
12-04-2021||India||On Day 1 of 'Tika Utsav', states complain of Covid-19 vaccine shortage||The mass Covid-19 vaccination drive termed as ‘Tika Utsav’ by Prime Minister Narendra Modi began across the country on Sunday even as several states complained of shortage of vaccines.The ‘Tika Utsav’ comes at a time when India’s Covid-19 tally climbed to 13,525,348 while the death toll increased to 169,275 with 839 daily new fatalities, the highest since October 18, 2020, according to HT’s Covid-19 dashboard.In places such as Nainital and Tehri Garhwal in Uttarakhand, Rajsamand and Pratapgarh in Rajasthan, Sitara and Panvel in Maharashtra and Morena in Madhya Pradesh, the drive had to be stopped midway as centres ran out of stock, officials said.Read more: As 'Tika Utsav' begins, PM Modi posts 4 requests for countrymenShortages were also reported from other places such Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand and Bihar, forcing state governments to scale down their daily vaccination targets.Several chief ministers -- Rajasthan’s Ashok Gehlot, Maharashtra’s Uddhav Thackeray, Delhi’s Arvind Kejriwal and Punjab’s Amarinder Singh informed the Centre about the vaccine shortages and sought immediate replenishment of stocks to meet new targets set by the Central government.“The Government of India has assured to send four lakh doses by Sunday night but that will be sufficient only for a day. The chief minister has demanded for 30 lakh doses and also wrote to the prime minister in this regard on Thursday,” said a senior Rajasthan government official, who was not willing to be quoted.Read more: On day 1 of 'Tika Utsav', over 2.7 mn doses of Covid-19 vaccine administeredA Punjab health department official, requesting anonymity, said lesser number of people were vaccinated on Sunday due to the shortage.In Uttarakhand, due to shortage of vaccine doses, Sunday witnessed less vaccination sessions with 519 vaccination sessions which was 178 less than the sessions done on Friday.As many as 900 vaccination sites in Odisha were shut on Sunday due to vaccine shortage, state health officials said.Bihar vaccinated 206,354 people on the opening day of the four-day ‘Tika Utsav’ on Sunday, amid reports of shortage of Covaxin, which was lower than Saturday’s inoculated of 206,354 people. State’s director of family welfare, Bijay Panigrahi, said, while vaccination is underway in 579 out of over 1,400 centres in the state, the inoculation programme may have to be stopped in many places on Monday, if fresh vaccine stock does not arrive. “We will know the actual position only after completion of vaccination work in the evening. I think the entire stock will be exhausted by today,” Panigrahi said.Till Saturday, the state had 233,658 doses of Covishield and 77,960 doses of Covaxin vaccines.Read more: On Day 1 of Tika Utsav, Delhi vaccinates over 1 lakh people amid record Covid-19 surgeOn Friday, several states warned that they would run out of vaccines in the next few days, prompting Union health minister Harsh Vardhan to reiterate that there was no shortage and the country has more than 43 million doses in stock or in the pipeline. To be sure, the problem seems to be more a result of last-mile allocation of vaccines within states, since, at the aggregate level, all of them have at least as many doses as they administer in a couple of days.Modi, during the CMs’ meet , said vaccines will have to be prioritised due to limited supply and lamented that some people were playing politics on the issue. “Those who have the habit of doing politics, let them do so. I have faced much criticism, but we remain committed to serving the people,” he said.(With inputs from state bureaus and agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/on-day-1-of-tika-utsav-states-complain-of-covid-19-vaccine-shortage-101618169792975.html
12-04-2021||India||Covid-19 norms flouted in 50 worst districts: Centre||The Centre on Sunday warned the three worst affected states — Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh and Punjab — that Covid-appropriate behaviour was not being followed in 50 of their districts, necessitating greater enforcement efforts.Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan wrote to these states based on feedback received from central teams sent last week.“These teams were to assess the situation on the ground, share their feedback, and work closely with the state authorities in looking for solutions. The health secretary’s letter is based on the feedback received from these teams, and asks them to plug the loopholes,” said a senior official in the health ministry.Read more: Delhi breaks all records in daily Covid-19 cases, Kejriwal rules out lockdownThe central teams found a lack of adequate surveillance measures being taken by the state administrations, especially in areas declared containment zones, inadequate testing using RT-PCR tests, insufficient manpower on Covid-19 duty, among other things.The teams sent to Maharashtra found containment operations sub-optimal, especially in the Satara, Sangli and Aurangabad districts, with less than satisfactory perimeter control, a lack of active surveillance for influenza-like illness cases, mostly due to limited human resources. The testing capacity in many districts such as Satara, Bhandara, Palghar, Amravati, Jalna and Latur is overwhelmed, resulting in delays in reporting of results. Also, some districts have a skewed RT-PCR and rapid antigen testing ratio that needs improvement.Read more: Centre halts exports of Remdesivir amid rising Covid-19 cases“According to central government guidelines, at least 70% of the tests being conducted to detect Covid-19 need to be done through RT-PCR. All states will have to comply with this directive as RAT (rapid antigen test) is meant to be used in certain situations such as containment zones where mass testing is required to know the disease spread in a short span of time. It cannot replace RT-PCR testing,” said a health ministry official, requesting anonymity.Some districts are reporting a large number of cases from outside containment zones, for which the Centre advised states to expand containment areas or to notify new zones so that adequate surveillance measures can be taken.In Bhandara and Satara districts, a large percentage of Covid-19 patients are under home isolation, which requires rigorous follow-ups to minimise mortality. However, such a thorough follow-up is not happening currently.In Chhattisgarh, the team from Raipur and Jashpur reported a lack of perimeter control in containment zones, with no restriction on movement of people inside these zones either.“…Containment zones including micro containment zones need to be strictly implemented. Contact tracing efforts need to be reinforced in Korba. Resistance (even attacks on health care workers) to containment activities and testing was reported by the team from Dhaneli village, Raipur. This needs to be addressed on an urgent basis,” read Bhushan’s letter.Read more: Maharashtra reports 63,294 Covid-19 cases in biggest daily surge since onset of pandemicAnother issue flagged by the expert teams was shortage of RT-PCR testing facilities in Korba, Durg, and Balod districts, for which the state has been advised to explore the use of mobile testing labs.In Punjab, it was pointed out that there is an acute need for adopting enhanced contact tracing measures, especially in Patiala and Ludhiana.“Additional manpower must be deployed for contact tracing on a priority basis. Low rates of testing have been reported from Patiala. Also as reported by the team, there is no RT-PCR testing laboratory in Rupnagar. This has been addressed urgently. There is no dedicated Covid hospital in SAS Nagar and Rupnagar districts, and patients are being referred to neighbouring districts or Chandigarh... Teams have also reported issues with procurement of ventilators for proper case management in SAS Nagar. ln Rupnagar, although ventilators are available, these are not being optimally utilised due to shortage of health care workforce, particularly doctors and nurses…,” the team noted.The Centre advised the state to make contractual hiring of health care workers as per its additional requirement. Slow pace of vaccination among the elderly and those above 45 with comorbidities, especially in Patiala and Ludhiana, needs to be addressed on priority, it said.Read more: India observes 4-day 'Tika Utsav' as PM Modi calls for mass Covid-19 vaccinationFor the lack of Covid-appropriate behaviour in the general public, stricter ground-level enforcement of rules has been suggested.Experts say the way case numbers are rising, it is imperative to take strict containment measures. “The virus is very much in circulation, and clearly spreading faster than before. What we need to do is take stringent measures in terms of increasing testing, tracking and isolating cases in time so that they don’t spread the disease within the community. There is also a need for enhancing community-level surveillance so that no case is missed, for as long we keep missing cases, the virus will continue to spread,” said Jacob John, former virology head, CMC, Vellore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-norms-flouted-in-50-worst-districts-centre-101618166937900.html

12-04-2021||India||Fear of 2020 rerun grips Delhi's migrants amid Covid-19 infection spike||Every evening, Anil Kumar, who lives in Shahpur Garhi village in north Delhi and works in a plastic factory in the nearby Narela industrial area, religiously checks the day’s Covid-19-related news on his mobile. On Saturday, he could tell the exact number of new cases in Delhi, and how some hospitals in neighbouring Noida and Ghaziabad had run out of vaccines.“I am keeping a close watch on the Covid-19 situation, because it will help me decide when it is time to leave the city. Night curfew has already been imposed, lockdown could be next,” says Kumar. “I do not want to be caught off-guard like last year. Some of my friends who recently lost their jobs have already left for their villages.”Kumar is not the only one. There is fear and anxiety among the thousands of migrant workers in villages such as Shahpur Garhi, Tikri Khurd, Bhor Garh, and Singhola.The Narela industrial area has about 3,500 factories, manufacturing everything from footwear to auto parts and providing direct and indirect employment to about 150,000 people. Over the last two decades, as demand for housing labourers rose here, these villages transformed into workers’ colonies with hundreds of multi-storey tenements. Together, they housed about 100,000 people mostly from eastern UP and Bihar.Read more: Fearing lockdown, some migrants opt to go homeShahpur Garhi, a farming village till the mid-90s, alone was home to about 15,000 people before the lockdown last year. The village’s residents’ welfare association (RWA) president Surinder Singh Khatri says that soon after the lockdown, the village had turned into a ghost colony. Within a couple of months, the number of residents there had fallen to 3,000.“Last year, about 90% of the workers had left for their villages and we thought that they will never return. Most permanent residents here are dependent on rental income. But, thankfully, by the end of last year the workers were back, but today they are worried again and are talking of going back,” says Khatri, who also owns a tenement in the village.“People are leaving in small numbers right now, but we fear it might soon become an exodus. Three of my tenants from Bihar have already told me they will leave next week,” says Anand Khatri, another landlord.Read more: Amid Mumbai lockdown talk, migrant movement seen on MP routeMonthly rent for a room here varies from ₹2,000 to ₹2,500. The average monthly income of a tenant in these villages is around ₹13,000.Labourers living in these villages said that last year they had left due to fear of contracting the disease, but this time it was because work in Narela had been drying up in the past few weeks. “Last year, a lot of us had taken loans from local moneylenders to survive when we were in our villages, and we are yet to repay them. But when we returned , the landlords here forced us to pay all the pending rent in instalments,” says Satish Singh, who works in plastic factory.Rajiv Kumar, who lives in the nearby Bhor Garh village and lost his job in a footwear factory last week, says he will have no choice but to leave if he did not find work soon. “My factory owner explained that with Covid-19 cases rising in Maharashtra, he has few orders and will have to halt production,” he says.Similarly, Arun Prajapati, who lives in Tikri Khurd and, like Rajiv Kumar, works in footwear factory, says what worries him most is that, unlike last time, when factory owners provided food during the lockdown, they may not be as considerate this time. “I will be on my own if I am caught in another lockdown as most factory owners are not as sympathetic this year. I cannot decide if I should leave or watch the situation for some more time,” says Prajapati. “Last year, I walked almost 100km with my wife and 10-year-old daughter in May before a truck offered us a ride home. I do not want to be in the same situation again”.Read more: Migrant labourers leave Mumbai in packed trains fearing lockdownLakshman Mahto, who runs a dhaba for factory workers in the Narela Industrial Complex, says that a lot of his customers who left last year never returned. “And of the some who did, many have stopped coming in the past few days. Workers are leaving as work is dwindling in factories here ,” he says.He is not exaggerating.Bhagwat Dayal Aggarwal, president of the Narela Industrial Welfare Association, said the factories that were working at about 60% capacity before the current surge in coronavirus cases a month back, are now working at only at 35% capacity.“Things were slowly getting better after the lockdown. But this sharp and sudden surge in coronavirus disease cases, which has led to night curfews in many major cities, is again lowering demand. Many factories here have stopped production, and many are on the verge of doing so. They have no choice but to reduce manpower,” says Aggarwal.Deepak Vats, whose factory makes plastic containers and toys, says with cases rising in the states from where he got a lot of business, he has had to reduce capacity. “About a month ago, I was working at 70% capacity and employed 25 people. Now, I am working at 35% capacity with only 12 people ,” he says.It is late afternoon and back in Shahpur Ghari, Ranjeet Kumar, who is on night duty, is ready to leave for work.He says he worries being mistreated by his landlord if there is a lockdown and he loses his job. “Some of us were treated badly after we failed to pay the rent last year. We were shocked by their rude behaviour. I just hope they do not do it again if I lose my job and fail to pay,” he says.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fear-of-2020-rerun-grips-delhi-s-migrants-amid-covid-19-infection-spike-101618163342250.html
12-04-2021||India||After Crime Branch, Mumbai top cop may make changes in EOW||Mumbai Days after he ordered the transfer of 84 police officers, most of them who belonged to the elite Crime Branch, Mumbai Police commissioner Hemant Nagrale is likely to initiate a similar ‘clean-up drive’ in the Economic Offences Wing (EOW), people familiar with the developments said. Ever since he took charge as the top cop on March 17, after former top cop Param Bir Singh was shunted out following the row over suspended Mumbai police officer Sachin Waze’s alleged involvement in the bomb scare outside industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s residence, Nagrale has suspended 65 officers who had served in the Crime Branch for over five years. Officers who have been serving in the EOW for more than four years are likely to be his next target, the people cited above said. In a recent order to all the unit heads, EOW joint commissioner of police Niket Kaushik had hinted at possible transfers in the coming days. The order, a copy of which was accessed by HT, read: “Possible transfers of those officers who are completing four years in EOW as of May 31, 2021, cannot be ruled out in upcoming general transfers (which occurs every year in June). Hence, all unit heads are hereby directed henceforth not to give such officers the investigation of new cases.” The EOW deals with cases such as multi-crore banking fraud, corporate frauds, investment frauds, housing frauds by builders among other white-collar crimes. Generally, a police officer is supposed to serve at a post for a period of three years before his next transfer. “There are officers here (in EOW) who have been in the department for the past six to seven years by merely switching their postings within the EOW during the transfers,” the people cited above said. “Once these officers are moved out, 45 to 50 per cent of posts of officers in this wing would go vacant. These posts would be filled up by new officers,” an EOW officer said, requesting anonymity. Speaking on the transfers, a senior IPS officer who did not wish to be named said: “The commissioner’s clean-up drive aims to uproot the nexus or connivance of policemen with wrong elements that ultimately encourage corruption in the police department. It makes them indulge in unethical practices which eventually could lead to another Sachin Vaze-like episode which has brought tremendous embarrassment to Mumbai Police.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-crime-branch-mumbai-top-cop-may-make-changes-in-eow-101618167512623.html

The poll covered CEOs from both manufacturing and services sectors. About 68% of the respondents belonged to micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs).While 96% of the CEOs said the industry is well-prepared for the implementation of stricter health and safety protocols, 93% of them preferred “stringent implementation of safety norms” over partial lockdowns.Read more: Fear of 2020 rerun grips Delhi's migrants amid Covid-19 infection spikeAbout 60% of the CEOs polled said their production could be affected if there are restrictions on movement of labourers during partial lockdowns and majority of them feared up to 50% production loss if restrictions are imposed on the ecosystem that supports movement of goods, CII said.While 57% of the companies expressed the need to stock raw materials in excess of just-in-time levels to meet any likely shortage of raw materials, about 31% of them said they would accommodate their labour force in the factory in case of movement restrictions due to night curfew.More than 60% of the CEOs suggested that the government should allow the movement of workers in all shifts during night curfews and also free movement of goods along with the required personnel to facilitate the movement of goods. “This should be allowed with all workers and industry staff strictly following all health and safety protocols,” the CII statement said, quoting the survey.Read more: Centre halts exports of Remdesivir amid rising Covid-19 casesLooking at ways to mitigate the impact of the restrictions, 67% of CEOs expressed their desire to work with the government for mass vaccination of eligible workforce who are 45 years and above.“Protecting livelihoods along with lives is essential and industry is keen to work with the government on universal coverage (18 years and above) of vaccination programme and in implementing strict health and safety protocols,” said CII president-designate TV Narendran.The government handled both lives and livelihoods effectively during the first wave, he said in the statement. “It could do so again by keeping industrial activities out of the ambit of partial lockdowns aimed at restricting social gatherings. This will help India recover from the economic contraction and stabilize the upward growth trends being currently witnessed in several sectors,” he added.CII is observing ‘Tika Utsav’ from April 11-14 April across the country as announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the statement said. CII has already activated its 65 state offices and has written to over 9,000 members from the industry to facilitate vaccinations of the eligible workforce.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/survey-of-ceos-curbs-better-than-lockdown-101618165592610.html

They would deposit one brick each as they walked to make a pathway. In an obscure corner of then Bangalore, these men were given four makeshift sheds and one big dream - make India’s first satellite.Among them was 26-year-old Surendra Pal who was responsible for the development and fabrication of all telecommunication systems for Aryabhata. Irreverent to the importance of the task at his hands, the pigeons who had a free reign in these sheds often targeted his thick curly hair.“The facilities were minimal. We were working out of sheds. But what happened in those sheds is a true testament to our aspirations and abilities. We were building a satellite without anyone’s help, without sufficient books for consultation or enough facilities. Most of us had not a seen a satellite in real life when started,” said Pal.The story of the Aryabhata and the four sheds in Peenya started around 1968 when Vikram Sarabhai who was heading India’s space programme asked one of his students, UR Rao, to come up with a plan for the development of satellite technology in India. By 1969 UR Rao assembled a team of about 20 engineers to be built India’s first satellite.Rao in his book ‘India’s Rise As A Space Power’ writes that by August 1971, the Soviets agreed to launch India’s satellites. As per the Soviet agreement, India had to design, fabricate and test the satellites and they would launch a satellite for free. After finalizing the specification of the satellite, they approached Indira Gandhi with a budget. He proposed a budget of ₹3 crores, and it was approved. The next step was finding a location to build it.Until that point, India’s Thumba in Kerala was the hub of India’s space programme, but Rao decided that the development of the project would take place in Bengaluru. “One of the reasons for the decision was the access to a number of industries and scientific institutes in the city. Rao met the then chief minister of the state Devaraj Urs and he allocated a property in Peenya for the development of the project,” says Pal.Pal recollected that unlike the Peenya of today, which is a buzzing industrial hub, his colleagues and he were welcome by a large, deserted area. “At the point, the space programme was still under the department of atomic energy and buses in ‘atomic energy grey colour’ would drop us to Peenya. When it rains, the entire place would be slushy. So, we would carry bricks to that we can make our way through it,” he remembers.While today India’s space programmes are guarded by the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF), back then two policemen with rifles provided security at Peenya when work on Aryabhata began. “It’s funny actually. More than the satellite that was under fabrication in the sheds, the policemen were used to worry more about their rifles. Because they feared someone would steal it, they used to lock them inside a room,” he says.The sheds were not the most comfortable places to work in. Out of the four, one was converted into a laboratory and another was a clean room, while the other two sheds were used for all other tasks. “The first task our day was to clean all the tables and equipment. Then there would be bird droppings. My thick curly hair too was a target for these pigeons,” he says.These little inconveniences were often forgotten because they had a bigger task of making a satellite from scratch, especially since these engineers, with an average age of 26, had never seen a satellite in their lives before. “Since the country was under sanctions, there was no transfer of technology and we had to figure how to build a satellite on our own. There were no reference books. I still remember that the only book that was available was a 1968 publication from Bell Telephone Labs which talked about early-bird satellites and some papers from Nasa,” Pal says.Even Pal’s college education didn’t prepare him for the task he was entrusted with. “It was all our thinking and innovation. Most importantly, UR Rao allowed us to innovate and do whatever it takes. Whenever I use to approach him saying I wanted to consult someone about some issue. He used to tell me that there is no one and no one knows more about the topic than me. Then he would ask to figure it out myself and I did,” Pal says.After years of hard work, the satellite was finally ready by 1975. It was only after the dates of the tentative launch were fixed the scientists realised the satellite had no name. Three names were sent to Prime Minister Gandhi - Jawahar, Maitri, Aryabhata and she chose Aryabhata.Finally, on April 16, 1975, Aryabhata, a dream that began in sheds of Peenya in Bengaluru, took off to the skies at the Kapustin Yar Cosmodrome near Volgograd in Russia. Twelve minutes after launch, Aryabhata was placed in its designated orbit at a height. “UR Rao was emotional; he hugged each one of us. Satish Dhawan brought us samosas and sweets to celebrate, but the samosas got spoilt. He promised to get us all samosas when we returned to Moscow,” remembers Pal with a smile.Pal says that after all these years, when he sits down to think about those days, it still baffles how some men in their 20’s managed to build a satellite from scratch from metal sheds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/4-sheds-for-office-and-1-big-dream-how-india-s-1st-satellite-took-form-101618081166283.html
12-04-2021||Today's||India’s quest for safe motherhood for all||Each year, India celebrates Safe Motherhood Day on April 11 to renew and reaffirm our commitment to ensure that every woman in India has access to essential and universal maternal health services, with dignity and respect. The survival and well-being of mothers is not only important in their own right but central to solving broader economic, social and developmental challenges. In spite of the unprecedented challenges brought on by the ongoing pandemic, India, like many countries, declared that no matter what, ensuring access to safe delivery and antenatal and postnatal care is a non-negotiable agenda.India has made rapid strides in the reduction of maternal and newborn mortality through massive and strategic investments made under the National Health Mission (NHM). Today we have brought the Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR) down to 113 from 556 in 1990. Our MMR has fallen faster than the global decline and we have done remarkably well to be on track to achieve the Sustainable Development Goal 3 (SDG 3) of an MMR below 70 by 2030.Safe motherhood is closely tied to the continuum of care, which is a crucial interplay of pre-pregnancy and pregnancy factors including family planning, nutrition, adolescent health and access to safe abortion services. It also encompasses a positive birthing experience to ensure that women give birth in an environment that is safe and allows them to have control through decision-making.Among the many pathbreaking schemes that support this mission, the Janani Surakhsa Yojana (JSY) under the NHM, a demand promotion scheme, was the first to be implemented. This was followed by the Janani Shishu Suraksha Karyakram (JSSK), which gives numerous free entitlements including free dietary support, drugs, diagnostics and ambulance facilities to expectant women, helping to reduce out-of-pocket expenditure. As a result of these interventions, institutional deliveries have risen to nearly 80%.Carrying forward the vision of Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi, the Pradhan Mantri Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan (PMSMA) was launched in 2016 to provide special free antenatal care to pregnant women across the country in order to detect and prevent high-risk pregnancies. In 2018, PM Modi launched the ambitious Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PMJAY), to provide financial cover for secondary and tertiary care, including for services related to childbirth. Additionally, the government has also taken a giant leap towards providing accessible and affordable health care by setting up Ayushman Bharat-Health and Wellness Centres (AB-HWCs), to deliver a comprehensive range of services encompassing care during pregnancy and childbirth.Even with such landmark moves, the schemes, by themselves, are not enough to achieve the numbers set by our policies and commitments. There is scope for greater improvement in the quality of health care services. Thus, in 2017, the government launched Labour room Quality improvement Initiative (LaQshya) to improve quality of care in labour room and maternity operation theatres in public health facilities by focusing on intra-partum and immediate post-partum period and upholding the agenda of respectful maternity care and birth companionship.In another landmark policy decision, the government rolled out the Midwifery Initiative in 2018 to provide women-centric essential maternal, newborn, and reproductive health care through a specialised workforce comprising Nurse Practitioners in Midwifery (NPMs) in designated Midwifery-Led Care Units (MLCU). Nevertheless, there is a need to go beyond service delivery to assured service delivery. In the same spirit, in 2019, Surakshit Matritva Aashwasan (SUMAN) was launched, assuring delivery of maternal and newborn health care services with respect and dignity and ascertaining zero tolerance for denial of services. This initiative envisages to provide service guarantee along with large-scale community engagement and a responsive grievance redressal system.The 360-degree approach builds on the success so far and pushes for momentous change that powers quality service delivery with human dignity. In this regard, the Medical Termination of Pregnancy (Amendment) Bill, 2021, has now received the assent of the President of India and is duly notified. It increases the ambit and access to safe abortion services and will ensure dignity, autonomy, confidentiality and justice for women who need to terminate pregnancies. Another noteworthy milestone in the arena of women’s health is the inter-ministerial convergence of my ministry of health and family welfare with the ministry of women and child development for the POSHAN Abhiyaan.As the government strives to bring about a visible improvement in health outcomes for women and children through newer initiatives, a stronger national commitment becomes a prerequisite to success. We are committed to withstand new challenges and envisage assuring safe motherhood for all. In this endeavour, everyone has a role to play. Collaborative efforts are needed to meet the health needs of women, but as it is with every endeavour for the people, it can never happen without the people’s involvement. Hence, I urge all stakeholders and, most importantly, members of civil society to come together and make concerted efforts with solidarity and compassion to prioritise the health of women which shall ultimately contribute to building a prosperous, healthy and empowered New India.Harsh Vardhan is Union minister of health and family welfare The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/indias-quest-for-safe-motherhood-for-all-101618230820844.html
12-04-2021||Editorials||Stop public rallies, now||India is in the middle of its most serious public health emergency — more serious and severe than last year, when the coronavirus pandemic first struck. Each day brings in a new record of the number of cases (on Sunday, daily cases crossed 170,000). Each day brings in a new set of alarming figures from some of India’s largest, politically sensitive, and economically crucial states. Each day brings in more reports of the impact of the new variants of Sars-Cov-2. And each day brings in tragic stories of human suffering, isolation, even fatalities, devastating for those who have lost their loved ones to Covid-19.There are only two known ways to beat the pand-emic. The first is vaccination. More vaccines need to be approved (one was on Monday, and not a moment too soon), more demographic groups need to be able to access the vaccine, more data needs to be transparently disclosed, and manufacturing capacities need to be expanded. The second is Covid-19-appropriate behaviour — which either stems from a strong sense of citizen responsibility or government diktats, or both. With enhanced restrictions in key urban centres, the State is now trying to nudge citizen behaviour back to the norms of the past year. But this will not work out unless India’s national leaders — political figures who inspire citizens, who have the power to take life-altering decisions, and who have political organisations at their disposal with unprecedented mass outreach — can credibly communicate the need for social distancing. This credibility is today missing, either because governments have happily allowed mega religious congregations or because political leaders are still — even in the middle of this nightmarish pandemic — addressing hundreds of thousands of people, many of whom are unmasked and jostling for space with each other, in public rallies. To be sure, democracy is a non-negotiable and so is the right of citizens to elect their representatives at regular intervals and the right of political parties to propagate their views. But political communication must happen in ways that don’t risk people’s lives, and send out a message of complacency and irresponsibility at a time when caution and responsibility needs to be exercised. Lives are at stake. An all-party consensus on reconfiguring the tools of campaigning for the remaining phases of Bengal’s polls to make it Covid-19-appropriate is worth considering.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/stop-public-rallies-now-101618231362047.html
12-04-2021||Editorials||On thermal plants, take meaningful steps||An analysis by the New Delhi-based think-tank, Centre for Science and Environment, suggests that the new thermal power plant norms issued by the Centre on March 31, which gives an extension of one to three years to plants to comply, could jeopardise India’s emission reduction goals, crucial in the effort to tackle the climate crisis. The penalty charged to companies for not complying with the extended deadline is lower than the cost of complying with the rules, which are meant to reduce emissions. While the government claims that the penalty has to borne by the plant and charges associated with the equipment to meet norms can be passed on to the consumers, experts argue the discrepancy skews incentives and undermines the environment. The environment ministry first notified superior emission standards in 2015 for implementation by the end of 2017. This deadline was extended to 2022. Last year, the Union power ministry requested another deferment on account of the pandemic-linked economic slowdown and the inability to source emission-reduction technologies. While it is true that Covid-19 derailed plans, evaluations suggest that no stakeholder has been trying hard enough to make the critical shift. The delay has environmental and health costs. For example, pollution from thermal power plants in the vicinity of Delhi is one of the reasons for the toxic air. A report by the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air show that 682 people die across Delhi-NCR every year due to toxic fumes from these plants. Meaningful action (decommissioning of polluting plants and higher penalties) must be taken to put pressure on erring thermal power plants to clean up their act.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/on-thermal-plants-take-meaningful-steps-101618230822040.html
