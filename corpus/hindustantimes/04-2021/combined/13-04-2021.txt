The court also directed the Central as well as state government to ensure sufficient production of Remdesivir by making raw material available to pharmaceutical companies, ensure its supply in the open market and to take stern action against those who were hoarding it and black marketing it. The bench of justices Siddhartha Varma and Ajit Kumar passed the order on a suo motu public interest litigation petition (PIL) dealing with the condition of quarantine centres of the state and treatment of corona patients. “The surge has absolutely paralysed public life and all the medical aid systems have reached a stage of complete saturation. We have been informed that Covid hospitals are flooded with patients and there is shortage of both manpower and facilities.” “The situation is so alarming that if it is not handled carefully and cautiously, we may head towards a stage of complete collapse of the public health system,” observed the bench. The bench directed, “While we insist on emergency purchases of BiPAP machines ( a kind of ventilator) and high flow cannula masks to meet the demands of patients who may even be lying in the corridors of Covid hospitals/ centres, we direct the government to acquire open places in the city areas of districts that are worst hit in the state, to set up temporary level 1 hospital in a makeshift structure.” The bench went on to observe, “Arrange man-power on contract basis immediately to serve all those admitted to temporary level 1 Covid hospitals/ centres. We also direct for immediate purchase and supply of BiPAP machine and high flow cannula masks in ambulances of all the district hospitals and level 2 and level 3 hospitals of districts like Prayagraj, Lucknow,Varanasi,Kanpur and Gorakhpur, where Covid infection has got widely spread.” “We have been informed that a new Covid testing machine (cobas) is not functioning for want of testing kit. We direct the state government to provide/arrange testing kits for this machine at Moti LaL Nehru College, Allahabad within 24 hours.” The court asked the state government to vigorously carry out the immunisation programme in the state. On medical needs of non-Covid patients, the bench said, “We must not forget that people suffer from various other diseases and so they may need not only urgent medical help but incentive care admission as well.” The court directed the state government to buy more ICU beds for hospitals. “We must give priority to public health over elections and the government is expected to streamline every department of public health and public care in the light of the observations made hereinabove,” said the bench while fixing April 19 as the next date of hearing in the case. During the course of hearing, some lawyers complained that health officials were not conducting Covid test properly to show fewer patients and that samples were kept pending for test for more than 12 hours.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/hc-to-state-look-into-viability-of-complete-lock-down-in-worst-covid-hit-districts-101618338526988.html

He also touched upon the twin issue of according scheduled tribe (ST) status to the 11 Gorkha sub-communities. “The Centre and the state government (in case the BJP forms the government) would jointly find out a permanent political solution and the BJP can only give ST status to the 11 Gorkha communities,” Shah said while addressing a rally in Darjeeling.The BJP in its Lok Sabha election manifesto in 2019 promised to find a permanent political solution and to accord scheduled tribe status to the 11 communities. The Gorkha Janmukti Morcha (GJM), the most trusted ally of the BJP since 2009, has been blaming the BJP for ‘hoodwinking’ the Gorkhas. The GJM, which is now divided into two factions, is supporting the Trinamool Congress in the ongoing assembly election in West Bengal.“The statements made by Prime Minister and Home Minister are all jumla (hoax). They say different things at different places to confuse people. Even the Gorkha community knows that earlier too they (BJP) made such promises at least thrice. They were not met. This time too they won’t be met. It is very unfortunate that the home minister is making such jumla statements to confuse the people,” said Tapas Roy, TMC spokesperson. Shah, who has been camping in Bengal to bolster the party’s campaign ahead of the fifth phase polls, addressed three public rallies and led a roadshow. Meanwhile, defence minister Rajnath Singh attacked TMC supremo Mamata Banerjee saying that she has realized that her party will lose the assembly polls and is hence inciting people to resort to violence.“Perhaps, Mamata Banerjee has accepted that she too is going to lose. It is evident from her desperation and the language she is using for her political opponents. She is inciting people to resort to violence,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/amit-shah-promises-permanent-solution-to-gorkha-issue-if-bjp-assumes-power-in-bengal-101618338282711.html

The artwork has been done on public walls including boundary walls of parks and government school in the villages. Apart from this, some artwork has also been carried out on boundary walls of villagers’ houses and shops. As per official data, Noida produces 900 metric tonne of waste daily.To help the city improve its cleanliness, the Noida Authority had undertaken several such initiatives to encourage people to follow the waste management practices, including door-to-door waste collection, waste segregation, starting waste-to-compost plants in residential areas and creating waste-to-art installations. Seven villages located along the Noida-Greater Noida expressway are beneficiaries of this makeover. These include Raipur Khadar (near sector 126), Rohillapur (near sector 132), Bakhtawarpur (near sector 127), Nagla Nagli (near sector 135), Nagli Sakpur (near Sector 133), Asgarpur (near sector 131) and Sultanpur (near sector 128). The project was started in October last year at Raipur Khadar village and the most recent project at Nagla Nagli village was completed last week. “We take permissions from the villagers before we paint on a house or a shop’s wall. We also create awareness among the villagers regarding the slogans and the message that our art sought to convey. For example, in Nagli Sakpur we have created artwork on waste segregation and also informed villagers how they can use wet waste for compost,” said Tarunima Bajpai from EcoSwop Solutions that was roped in for the artwork. The project is funded by tech major HCL as part of its corporate social responsibility (CSR) obligation. Mahesh, a resident of Raipur Khadar village said that since the group painted his shop, it had not been defaced. “People used to spit and urinate on the behind my shop earlier but it has stopped now since the wall has been painted,” he said. “We do not want villages left out of the beautification work,” said Ritu Maheshwari, CEO, Noida Authority.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/how-noida-s-villages-are-turning-colorful-one-wall-at-a-time-101618338222768.html

The panchayat elections in GB Nagar will be held on April 19, district officials said, adding that the last date of filing nomination papers was April 8.Dalelpur, which was earlier part of Gulawli village, was made a separate village in 2018, the officials said. With a population of about 500, the village has around 200 voters, they said. Local residents said that six people, including Kailash Chaprana, had initially filed their nominations for gram pradhan. “The local people recently held a meeting and decided to choose Kailash Chaprana unopposed. The other five people decided to withdraw their nomination papers,” said Neeraj Tyagi, a resident. Chaprana, a 55-year-old farmer, said he is happy that the villagers have chosen him as gram pradhan. “Our village is disconnected from Noida and Greater Noida due to Yamuna river. The Haryana government used to supply electricity to the village. But the power supply has been disconnected due to the Freight Corridor project which passes through our village,” he said.Chaprana said he will work to bring electricity to the village. “We charge our mobile phones using the batteries of cars. Also, we will develop a school, a hospital and a crematorium in the village,” he said. Vandita Srivastava, ADM (finance) and returning officer, said that Dalelpur was made a separate village in 2018. “This is the first time since 2018 that the villagers are going to vote. Local people have decided to elect a candidate unopposed for gram pradhan. The election department will conduct a fair election in the village,” she said.Dalelpur residents use a boat to cross Yamuna and visit Noida and Greater Noida. It takes them nearly 20 minutes to reach Greater Noida. The villagers said that if they use road route (a distance of about 70km), it will take them two hours to reach Greater Noida.Meanwhile, the GB Nagar district administration has received around 3,000 nomination forms against 1,325 posts in the local elections. Diwakar Singh, ADM (executive) and returning officer, said that elections will be held for zila panchayat members, gram pradhans, and gram panchayat members, among others. “We are aware of Dalelpur village. The administration will make suitable arrangements for elections there,” he said.According to the officials, Dalelpur became a part of Dadri assembly constituency after the delimitation exercise in 1983. Now, it comes under Jewar Block.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/gb-nagar-village-decides-to-elect-gram-pradhan-unopposed-101618338222147.html

At Pateshwari Mandir too, devotees’ turnout was low. Most of the temples also avoided distribution of prasad. “Devotees were not allowed to crowd inside the temple premises. Only five devotees at a time were allowed to enter the sanctum sanctorum of the temple,” said Sunil Pathak, head priest of Badi Devkali temple. Unlike in the past, no devotees visited Ayodhya from adjoining districts on the day due to the pandemic. Last year in Navratri (March 25 to April 2), the temple was closed due to the nationwide lockdown imposed to fight Covid and devotees could not worship the deity. The Ayodhya administration also tried to impose guidelines issued by the state government for devotees visiting temples. District magistrate Anuj Jha and senior superintendent of police Shailesh Pandey visited various temples to make sure government’s guidelines were being followed.Moreover, the Vishva Hindu Parishad has already cancelled the 84-Kosi Parikrama which was scheduled to start from April 27. A large number of saints and devotees from all over the country take part in this annual event. The parikrama is taken out by the VHP every year under the banner of Hanuman Mandal, Ayodhya, after Chaitra Navratri.The mela scheduled on April 21, when the Navratri ends, is a major event in Ayodhya in which several lakhs of people from adjoining areas participate. However, this time the Ayodhya administration is yet to issue any official order in this regard.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/covid-cloud-navratri-begins-on-low-key-note-in-ayodhya-101618338162668.html

Light to moderate rain will lash the plains in Kashmir and the Pir Panjal region as winds blowing from the Mediterranean, the western disturbance, will bring moisture to the region, the department said. “Light to moderate rains will start on Wednesday night and there will be widespread precipitation till April 18,” said meteorologist Mohammad Hussain Mir.Mir said the spell will not be continuous but there will be intermittent pauses. “Most rainfall will take place in the plains while hilly areas like Gulmarg and Pahalgam may receive rain as well as snowfall,” he said. There will be a break in precipitation on April 19 after which another weather system will hit the region. “Another western disturbance will bring rainfall again on April 21 and 22,” he said.April has already witnessed a few wet spells in the Valley. After a relatively hot February, March had mostly remained cold and rainy with intermittent precipitation across Jammu and Kashmir.The day temperature in Srinagar on Monday was 17.6°C against a normal of 20°C while the night temperature was 8.6°C.

13-04-2021||Noida||Dhanauri wetland runs dry, forest department rushes to fill its core||Noida: Dhanauri wetland, a major sarus crane habitat in Gautam Budh Nagar, has run dry. Officials of the district forest department on Tuesday said that they have rushed to fill the wetland, spread across 101 hectares, using borewells. Located at Dankaur in Greater Noida, about 33 hectares of the wetland was under water, as per a remote sensing exercise in 2015. It is home to about 211 species of waterbirds and is also one of the biggest habitats of sarus crane in the region. In 2019, the forest department had spotted over 80 sarus at Dhanauri out of 140 in the entire district. The wetland, which has been proposed by the state forest department to be declared as a Ramsar site (a wetland of international importance) and a sarus crane sanctuary, has never dried completely earlier, said the officials and birders. While the forest officials say that they are trying to ascertain the reasons, experts point out mismanagement and exploitation apart from dry weather for the wetland to have run dry. “We have started filling water in the core area of main wetland using a bore well, taking water from nearby villages. For now, we are using only one pumping set, and if required we may use more. This is for the first time that the entire wetland has dried up and we have to use an external source to fill it up. There are a number of birds and after evening a number of sarus cranes roost here, so it was important for us to take this step,” said PK Srivastava, divisional forest department (DFO), GB Nagar. Anand Arya, a Noida-based birder who was among the birders to have found the wetland in 2014 and initiated the legal battle for its recognition, said that the wetland needs immediate conservation. “It has been six years that the National Green Tribunal had ordered to recognise Dhanauri wetland under wetland rules, but no major steps were taken. Drying up of Dhanauri could also be attributed to construction around the wetland, and the forest department is up to a large extend responsible for not taking enough steps to declare it a Ramsar site,” said Arya. Though completely dry now, the ecologists had raised alarm in January this year when the Asian Waterbird Census (AWC) 2021, held by Wetlands International South Asia and the district forest department, found over four times drop in bird population as compared to 2020. The AWC 2021 found only 1,344 birds against 6,227 birds in January last year. “The climate change is causing drastic effects on the wetlands, besides Dhanauri has no external water sources and depends on rainwater. Also, the human interventions like agriculture activities at Dhanauri were increasing while the wetland suffered lack of conservational steps,” said TK Roy, a conservationist at Wetlands International South Asia. Meanwhile, the crane experts state that the mismanagement could lead to migration of the birds. “Drying up of such a habitat shows possibility of higher number of borewells in the area or water overdrawing, apart from the mismanagement. Now, sarus cranes, which have over 230 million years of evolution, are getting used to such phenomenon and they often move to better areas. The bird roosts in water at night as a protection against predators,” said KS Gopi Sundar, a scientist at the Nature Conservation Foundation. Sundar is also the global co-chair of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Stork, Ibis and Spoonbill Specialist Group (SIS-SG).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/dhanauri-wetland-runs-dry-forest-department-rushes-to-fill-its-core-101618338102732.html

We have been informed that Covid hospitals are flooded with patients and there is a shortage of both manpower and facilities,” the HC bench comprising justices Siddhartha Varma and Ajit Kumar observed. The bench passed the order on a suo motu public interest litigation petition (PIL) dealing with the condition of quarantine centres of the state and treatment of Covid-19 patients. “The situation is so alarming that if it is not handled carefully and cautiously, we may head towards a stage of a complete collapse of the public health system,” it added. The court also directed the Central as well as the state government to ensure sufficient production of Remdesivir by making raw material available to pharmaceutical companies, ensure its supply in the open market and take stern action against those who were hoarding and black marketing it. “While we insist on emergency purchases of BiPAP machines (a kind of ventilator) and high flow cannula masks to meet the demands of patients who may even be lying in the corridors of Covid hospitals/centres, we direct the government to acquire open places in the city areas of districts that are worst-hit in the state to set up temporary level 1 hospital in a makeshift structure,” the bench directed. The bench went on to observe, “Arrange manpower on contract basis immediately to serve all those admitted to temporary level 1 Covid hospitals/centres. We also direct immediate purchase and supply of BiPAP machine and high flow cannula masks in ambulances of all the district hospitals and level 2 and level 3 hospitals of districts like Prayagraj, Lucknow, Varanasi, Kanpur and Gorakhpur, where Covid infection has been widely spread.” “We have been informed that a new Covid testing machine (cobas) is not functioning for want of testing kit. We direct the state government to provide/arrange for testing kits for this machine at Moti Lal Nehru College, Prayagraj, within 24 hours,” the court stated. The court asked the state government to vigorously carry out the immunisation programme in the state. On the medical needs of non-Covid patients, the bench said, “We must not forget that people suffer from various other diseases and so they may not only need urgent medical help but intensive care admission as well.” The court directed the state government to buy more ICU beds for hospitals. “We must give priority to public health over elections and the government is expected to streamline every department of public health and public care in the light of the observations made hereinabove,” said the bench while fixing April 19 as the next date of hearing in the case. During the course of the hearing, some lawyers complained that health officials were not conducting the Covid-19 test properly to show fewer patients and that samples were kept pending for test for more than 12 hours.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/look-into-viability-of-complete-lockdown-in-worst-covid-hit-districts-hc-tells-up-govt-101618338043018.html
13-04-2021||Chandigarh||Exiled Kashmiri Pandits struggle for political representation||As the Jammu and Kashmir delimitation commission draws new electoral constituencies in the erstwhile state, Kashmiri Pandits have demanded that a few seats be reserved in the proposed legislative assembly. Two weeks after Pandit bodies met the delimitation commission, Congress leader Vivek Tankha, the son of a migrated Kashmiri Pandit, has requested the Prime Minister to consider grievances of the community before the delimitation process is completed.Tankha said he was optimistic as delimitation was the only way to get Kashmiri Pandits back on the political landscape of the Valley: “Post-migration we hardly ever saw any Pandit assembly member from Kashmir. Even before the migration when the presence of Pandits was thick in the Valley, there were just one or two constituencies that were represented by them, ” Tankha said.As per data from J&K migrant relief commission, as of January 2021, around 1,54,000 Kashmiri Pandits are living as migrants. Around 40,000 families were registered in the Jammu, and 20,000 in Delhi and other states. Thousands are also still present in the Valley. However, there has hardly been any representative of this community that has been part of the elected assembly in Kashmir for decades. The last time someone from the Kashmiri Pandit community made it to the Assembly was 2002. Even before the migration, the Assembly formed in 1996 had a lone MLA who belonged to the community despite their population being around 2 lakh in the Valley at the time.Tankha says from 1951 to 1996 (when insurgency in was at its peak), Pandits were elected from many constituencies such as Khulgam, Devsar and their bastion Habbakadal and these representations contributed to the overall empowerment of the community. However, post-migration, the community was scattered and there was not a single member to represent their demands.‘Community has become political fodder’ All India Kashmiri Samaj president Tej K Tikoo, however, said the community had become political fodder for politicians.“There is nothing concrete going on ground. There have been delimitations in the past as well, which did nothing better the condition of Kashmiri Pandits. At least till the 1960s, there were a couple of constituencies that were Pandit strongholds but when delimitation took place, even those four seats slipped from our hands,” Tickoo said, adding that there had been no response from the government despite multiple representations being made. “We had proposed that the upcoming 2021 census be considered for reference and a total estimate of all Kashmiri Pandits be done and seats reserved accordingly, but no one seems to be paying heed. Though they are planning to reserve seats for tribal communities, no plan has been formulated for us,” Tikoo added.The delimitation commission headed by the former Supreme Court judge Ranjana Desai is using the 2011 census as the reference data to draw a new electoral map of the UT. This is unique considering the readjustments made recently for other regions were done on the basis of the 2001 census.PM’s intervention sought In a letter dated April 8, Tankha had written to the PM saying the commission was powerless to draw constituencies exclusively for minorities and asked for his intervention.“As a student of law, I know the delimitation commission is powerless to draw political constituencies for exclusive representation of minorities, unless so empowered by law,” he wrote.Speaking on the issue, Congress stalwart, Shashi Tharoor, had also said the issue needs sympathetic consideration and genuine attention: “This is a very interesting idea to address the disenfranchisement of Kashmiri Pandits & it does deserve a serious and sympathetic consideration (sic),” Tharoor had tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/exiled-kashmiri-pandits-struggle-for-political-representation-101618337563609.html
13-04-2021||Chandigarh||Accident victim’s organs give new lease of life to 4 at PGIMER||A 27-year-old man from Kalka, who died due to fatal head injuries, has given a new lease of life to four needy patients through organ donation.The donor, Amit of Tipra village in Kalka, Panchkula, had fallen from the stairs at his home and injured his head on the night of April 6. After the mishap, he was rushed to civil hospital, Sector 6, Panchkula, and from there to Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education & Research (PGIMER), Chandigarh, where he was declared brain-dead on April 10.“Transplant coordinators at PGIMER talked to us about organ donation. The idea of having a chance to save someone else’s life made sense to us, even though we didn’t have the heart to take Amit off life support,” said Subhash Chander, Amit’s father.The transplant teams retrieved the donor’s kidneys and transplanted them to two terminally ill renal failure patients. Apart from this, Amit’s corneas were also harvested, which on transplantation restored the eyesight of two other patients.Prof HS Kohli, head of PGIMER nephrology department, said, “The generous gesture by the donor’s family has given a second lease of life to the two recipients as both of them were suffering from end-stage debilitating kidney ailment. Their chances of survival without transplant were bleak.”About the procedure, Prof Ashish Sharma, head of renal transplant surgery department, said, “Since there are challenges in doing transplant in Covid-19 days, special precautions are taken. The deceased donor as well as both recipients were tested and confirmed to be negative for Covid-19.”ROTTO PGIMER nodal officer Vipin Koushal said that since April 2020, 31 lives of terminally ill organ failure patients have been saved with the transplantation of 28 kidneys, two livers, one heart, one pancreas. Moreover, 113 sight-impaired patients have been cured through corneal transplants.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/accident-victim-s-organs-give-new-lease-of-life-to-4-at-pgimer-101618336722615.html
13-04-2021||Gurugram||Wildlife census: Forest dept to engage locals in monitoring monkey population in Haryana||In a first, the forest department in Haryana will engage the locals for monitoring the monkey population in urban areas. This will be a part of the ongoing wildlife census in the state.The monitoring will be done through mobile application ‘Wildlife Census Haryana’, wherein the public along with the forest department staff can give information regarding the sighting of the simian species in their respective areas. The state forest department is conducting the census survey in collaboration with experts from the Wildlife Institute of India (WII), Dehradun chapter.ML Rajvanshi, chief conservator of forests for wildlife, Haryana, said, “This wildlife census is focusing on mammals, with special reference to monkeys, as we want to find out the estimated population of monkeys in the state. Currently, wildlife management is an important issue for us. Based on the numbers revealed through the survey, we will devise strategies on how to manage their growing population, and to contain man-animal conflict.”The survey is focusing on both outside and inside protected areas as the species of rhesus macaques are found in large numbers in both the areas. With the help of ‘Wildlife Census Haryana’, the forest department will hold a statewide outreach programme from April 20-27, regarding the survey. The survey will be conducted outside protected areas from April 28-30, when the people are set to participate in the monitoring process through the application.According to the WII’s survey protocol document for the census, “…The application is developed to count the rhesus monkey population, along with other species outside the protected areas of Haryana. Haryana is among the several states where the rise in the monkey population has led to a rise in incidents of human-animal conflict... A person, who will collect the data, can also upload the pictures of the recorded animals.”The forest department officials said that managing the population of monkeys in urban areas, especially Gurugram and Faridabad, has been difficult in the past few years.Many residents have been attacked by monkeys, especially in areas near the Aravallis, such as Golf Course Road, MG Road, Gurgaon-Faridabad Road, Golf Course Extension Road, and Sohna Road, said the officials. In some instances, monkeys have also caused severe bruises and cuts on the people.According to Rajesh Chahal, wildlife inspector, Gurugram, the wildlife department receives at least one complaint of monkey attack on a daily basis. “At least one or two cases of either monkeys attacking children, monkeys entering houses, or electrocution of monkeys in urban areas is reported daily. The behavioural change in the species is due to both degradation of forest, and easy access to food (people feeding monkeys near their houses). Now, they know where food is easily available, and get ferocious and attack children (who are easy targets for them) when they don’t get food,” said Chahal.Four years ago, an attack by a troop of monkeys had resulted in the death of a resident in Nathupur. A 25-year-old man had fallen from his open terrace, and succumbed to his injuries on December 18, 2016, after being allegedly chased by the troop of monkeys.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/wildlife-census-forest-dept-to-engage-locals-in-monitoring-monkey-population-in-haryana-101618336662629.html
13-04-2021||Gurugram||Amid rising temperatures, Gurugram likely to see light rainfall this week||According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD) on Tuesday, Gurugram is likely to witness light rainfall this week amid a rise in the temperature.As per the weatherman, the city is expected to witness light rainfall or thunderstorms between April 15 and April 17, and the maximum temperature is likely to drop by 2-4° Celsius by April 17.Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre, said, “Light rainfall is expected in Delhi-NCR during the evening, night on April 16, which will lead to a dip in the maximum temperature in the region on April 17. Following that, the city is likely to see a rise in the temperature.”“This year, we saw rainfall for the last time around April 2-3, and the temperature has been on the rise since then. This is due to the lack of western disturbance activities. Both maximum and minimum temperatures have been higher than the normal level. Usually, with light rainfall, temperatures are maintained in the normal bracket during April,” Srivastava added.The temperature falls during the summers only with an impact of the western disturbance, which has been lower in number this April, compared to past years. The western disturbance is the wind originating over the Mediterranean region, which carries moisture and shed in the form of rainfall or snowfall, while travelling up the north.On Tuesday, Gurugram recorded a maximum temperature of 40.4° Celsius — the highest maximum temperature recorded so far in April. The city recorded a minimum temperature of 21.5° Celsius, which was 4° above the normal. The city had recorded its highest maximum temperature of the season on March 29, with the temperature recorded at 40.5° Celsius. Meanwhile, the city’s air quality entered the moderate zone on Tuesday. The Central Pollution Control Board recorded the air quality index (AQI) at 199, which has improved over the past 24 hours — from ‘poor’ AQI — which was recorded at 210 on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/amid-rising-temperatures-gurugram-likely-to-see-light-rainfall-this-week-101618336663268.html
13-04-2021||Gurugram||Residents, banquet hall owners in a fix over late weddings, reservations||The imposition of night curfew in the state upset the wedding plans of many in the city, with owners of banquet halls and hotels saying customers started calling them on Tuesday asking for changes in timings, schedules and seeking postponement of reservations. Hoteliers said that the night curfew will impact a majority of them as wedding ceremonies during the summer generally take place late evening or at night.According to tent owners and hotel owners’ associations, there are around 200 hotels and banquets halls in Gurugram district and 2,000 such facilities across the state, where reservations were made for dates between April 22 and May 20, considered an auspicious period for weddings as per religious calendars.“We have worked out that around 2,000 wedding events across Haryana will get impacted. We have very few wedding destination hotels. Revenue of around ₹3,000 crore that would have been generated will get hit. The hotel owners will make losses but suppliers and vendors might go out of business this year,” said Manbeer Choudhary, president, Hotel and Restaurant Association of Haryana.Business owners said that due to the imposition of a night curfew in Delhi and Noida, a number of such functions had shifted to Gurugram but this business will also get affected now. Another main reason for this shift was that 500 people are allowed in open spaces and 200 in a closed space at weddings in the city, while the cap is at 50 in Delhi.The Haryana government on Monday evening imposed a night curfew between 9pm and 5pm to curtail the spread of Covid-19 infections. The state government on Tuesday evening changed the night curfew timing, stating it would start from 10pm. However, hoteliers said this would be of little help.The hotel owners’ association has sought an audience with the chief minister and is hoping to get some relief in the matter, he said. “The shift in timings by an hour is a positive move, but guests and hotel workers should be exempted from the curfew,” Choudhary said.The Haryana Tent Dealers Association, meanwhile, said it submitted representations to the government seeking relaxation in timings. “Livelihood of thousands of people will get affected if the marriages are curtailed as so many people are involved in making these functions happen. Not only that, people have paid money to book hotels and tents and cancelling functions is not feasible,” said Anil Rao, president, Haryana Tent Dealers Association.Hoteliers and banquet hall owners said that customers were starting to worry about a lockdown-like situation soon.Virender Rana, a resident of Faridabad, whose cousin is getting married on April 20, booked a hotel in Karnal for the wedding and the families of the bride and the groom were to arrive from Roorkee and Faridabad, respectively. “A majority of our relatives were to come from Faridabad and Delhi and return at night, but now, they have expressed their inability to attend. A family from the Netherlands came especially for the wedding, but is now in two minds due to the night curfew,” said Rana.Rana said that the Haryana government should at least give them time till midnight for people to make the return trip. “Only 150 people have been invited, while the banquet hall is meant for 400 people. We are going to follow Covid safeguards,” he said.Another family in Gurugram, which has a wedding scheduled for April 25, shifted the venue from Delhi to Gurugram because of Covid-19 restrictions. “At least people going to weddings should be allowed to move in the night. We are trying to adjust but in the summer season, the function starts at 9pm. This curfew has dampened the spirits. The government must relax the timings,” said Ramesh Dahiya, whose niece is getting married.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/residents-banquet-hall-owners-in-a-fix-over-late-weddings-reservations-101618336662106.html
13-04-2021||Gurugram||ICU beds, ventilators for Covid-19 patients increased||The district administration on Tuesday increased the reservation of beds to 70%, from 50% at present, in intensive care units (ICUs) and of those with ventilators for Covid-19 patients, while the reservation of general beds was reduced to 40%, from 50%. The administration also directed private hospitals to strictly follow norms prescribed by the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR) for admitting Covid-19 patients, saying that only serious patients, who need intensive care, should be admitted.During a meeting with private hospitals on Tuesday, Dr Yash Garg, deputy commissioner, Gurugram, said that it came to their notice that private hospitals were admitting patients who could be treated in home isolation as well, due to health insurance policies.“Due to this reason, many serious patients suffering from Covid-19 find it difficult to secure admission. Patients should be admitted to wards on the basis of genuine requirement. Those who need to be admitted to ICU should be admitted there and those less serious should be treated in general wards or at home,” said Garg, adding that the hospitals must ensure an adequate number of beds, medicines and other equipment.The deputy commissioner also said that action would be taken against hospitals that don’t follow the prescribed admission norms.Health department officials said that at present, 185 Covid ICU beds and 48 ventilator beds are occupied, against the availability of 491 and 233, respectively, in total. As per the health department data, the total number of active cases in the district is currently at 6,460, of whom 6,018 Covid patients are in home isolation.Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, said that apart from following admission norms, private hospitals were also directed to provide daily data of available beds and hospitalization status on the Covid-19 portal. “There has been a surge in cases and more patients are now requiring hospitalisation, either in ICUs or on ventilators. It is because of this reason hospitals have been directed to daily update the data and ensure that there is no discrepancy in the information available in the public domain,” said Yadav.Yadav also said that a majority of the Covid-19 patients presently can be treated in home isolation. “Hospitals have been asked to make rational decisions on admitting patients. The number of Covid-19 patients in general wards is less, so the reserved beds in general wards were reduced,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/icu-beds-ventilators-for-covid-19-patients-increased-101618336606289.html
13-04-2021||Gurugram||Migrant workers start returning, admin dismisses concerns||Migrant workers in the city were seen leaving for their home towns in Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal and Bihar on Tuesday, after the Haryana government imposed a night curfew on Monday evening. Workers said that they were apprehensive of another lockdown due to the sudden spike in Covid-19 cases in Gurugram and are ready to return to their home towns.However, the district administration on Tuesday said that the number of people leaving was low and people cannot be stopped from moving from one place to another.Yash Garg, Gurugram’s deputy commissioner, said that the administration would reassure migrant workers that there was no danger to their livelihood and they should leave the city in a panic. “There is no such information that we will announce a lockdown. So, (it is not clear) why they are getting this impression and taking extreme steps,” he said.However, migrant workers said that their struggles following last year’s lockdown were still fresh in their memories and they want to avoid a repeat of the situation. On Tuesday, a few groups of migrant workers were spotted walking towards the railway station and bus stand after the curfew was imposed on Monday night. They were seen carrying their bags and walking holding their children.Hasina Bibi of West Bengal, who lived in a rented room in Tikri village in Sector 48, said that her family decided to return to their home state after learning about the night curfew, as their relatives asked them to return immediately. “We packed our stuff, mainly clothes and valuables, within an hour, kept our crockery at a local’s house. We will return after we all will get vaccinated and not before that,” she said.Another migrant, Nazrul Mandal, who returned to Jhansi on Tuesday evening, said trains are easily available now, unlike last year. “I had to walk nearly 550 miles to reach my home town and hardly got anything to eat. I hardly had any cash as my employer had not paid me for three months after the lockdown was announced,” he said.Many domestic helps on Tuesday informed their employers that they planning to return to their village and have asked to clear their dues.Lisha Parveen of Kolkata, who works as a domestic help on Golf Course Extension Road, said she informed all three families she used to cook for to look for a replacement. “People are extra cautious this year. I still remember how we reached home last year. It took seven days, with a change of 11 buses and a cost of more than ₹3,000. This time, it is better to pack our bags before travel restrictions are announced,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/migrant-workers-start-returning-admin-dismisses-concerns-101618336605688.html
13-04-2021||Chandigarh||Devotees inoculated at camps set up on Baisakhi in Ambala||To ramp up the Covid-19 vaccination drive during the four-day Tika Utsav, the Ambala health department set up camps outside gurdwaras to cover the eligible devotees on Baisakhi on Tuesday.At an inoculation camp in Durga Nagar area, a team of health workers motivated the residents to get the vaccine on the auspicious day.Poorna Rani, a woman in her late 90s, who came for the langar at Gurdwara Singh Sabha also got the jab at the camp.The nonagenarian’s daughter-in-law, Poonam, 58, said, “My husband has already got the jab and I got it today. I brought my mother-in-law along for the langar and now she is getting the vaccine at her own will.”Another woman, Balwinder Kaur, 60, said that despite resistance from her neighbours due to the fear of vaccine side effects, she got the jab to prove them wrong. “Earlier, we were anxiously waiting for the vaccine. Now when it is available, why should we hesitate in getting it?” Kaur said.To create awareness among the citizens, announcements were made on loudspeakers about the free vaccination camp.Dr Ashish, in-charge of Chourmastpur health centre in the city’s rural area, said that it was difficult to motivate the rural residents. “But we are trying to tell them about the benefits of the vaccine. If they seem hesitant to health centres, we ask them to get the jabs at such camps organised in community halls or religious places,” the officer said.The department has also started mobile vaccination drive and deployed eight ambulances in the district for the same, mostly giving jabs at workplaces, including banks.Civil surgeon Dr Kuldeep Singh said that as the vaccination drive is moving forward, resistance among beneficiaries, especially in the rural population, is going down.“Religious places have played an important role in promoting the vaccine. Announcements made from places of worship have had a genuine impact on human psyche,” he said.Ambala has inoculated — both first and second doses — more than two lakh beneficiaries. The district has so far reported 15,845 positive cases and 174 deaths. On Tuesday, 137 fresh cases and a death, was reported and the active caseload stood at 1,520.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/devotees-inoculated-at-camps-set-up-on-baisakhi-in-ambala-101618336604078.html
13-04-2021||Gurugram||Restaurants, pubs to shut shop by 9pm, fear big losses||Many restaurants and bars in the city on Tuesday decided to shut their operations by 9pm, citing interdistrict and interstate travel of staff members before the night curfew kicks in across the National Capital Region at 10pm.Inderjeet Banga, head, National Restaurants Association of India, Gurugram chapter, said, “We have requested the government to impose the curfew post 10pm as 70% of the guests visit restaurants and bars for drinks and dinner. To close operations at 10pm, we have to ask guests to give their last order at 9pm, which is still too early.”Restaurateurs in the city said that the curfew will hit their business, as the footfall fell sharply since Monday night. They said that the last year was difficult for the industry with dining facilities closed for several months due to the pandemic.“The new measure taken by the government is required, but it will have a huge impact on sales and revenues,” Banga.Rohit Mann, the director of Raise the Bar brewery at Clarens Hotel in Sector 29, said that their staff has started planning to return to their home towns and that the establishments that managed to continue operations after last year’s lockdown might not survive this time around. “Many outlets were closed last year and some that are trying new methods to run the show will not be able to make ends meet. The liquor licence fees and operation cost is so high that we will not be able to gain anything until 10pm. Either we will have to shut operations or move towards delivery options if they are allowed,” he said.Owners said that they cannot sustain operations on takeaways and deliveries alone. They said that the restrictions, coupled with the 50% cap in place, will adversely impact business.Arjun Sagar Gupta, founder of The Piano Man, said that it is an extremely difficult period for the hospitality industry at large, especially fine dining, bars and other operators whose primary revenue is generated in the evening and night hours. “There is unfortunately no structured support to ensure the survival of small businesses during these unprecedented times. The curfew has destroyed the modicum of hope that we were holding on to,” he said.“From a business point of view, the industry would be harder hit this time around, as most of us have stretched our capabilities to finance this period. The hospitality industry has been a major contributor towards tax revenues, employment and quality of life, and now, it requires well thought out support to survive the pandemic and bounce back. This is the time where we would need our peers’ and the government’s support.”Akshay Chauhan, owner of Boombox Brewstreet in Sector 29, said that they were just about to recover from the losses suffered last year, but the restrictions will bring them back to square one. “It is too early to close down operations at 10pm, as for it, we have to start packing up by 9pm. The footfall has already decreased with the fresh orders and we will have to permanently close down our establishments. Sales finally picked up and people had started visiting post 10pm, but we will not be able to survive any longer,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/restaurants-pubs-to-shut-shop-by-9pm-fear-big-losses-101618336602581.html
13-04-2021||Gurugram||Night curfew to kick in at 10pm, cops deployed||Officials of the district administration said that the state disaster management authority on Tuesday revised the timings of the night curfew and that it will now kick in from 10pm, instead 9pm, as stated on Monday.Even as the police department said that essential services would be allowed after 9pm and passes can be availed of by those working night shifts, officials of the district administration said they are awaiting a detailed order from the state government for clarity on the exemptions and curfew passes.Yash Garg, Gurugram’s deputy commissioner, said that a detailed order will be issued on the movement of essential workers during the curfew. “People involved in medical fields or exceptional cases will be allowed to move post 9pm. A detailed order is awaited from the government, following which a decision will be taken on curfew passes,” he said.The police on Tuesday deployed 41 special teams across the city to enforce the night curfew and four assistant commissioners of police (ACPs) were directed to keep a check of areas in their jurisdictions at night.Police commissioner KK Rao said, “Essential services will not be stopped but the vehicles will be checked and those who are working in night shifts or travelling for any emergency can avail of curfew pass from the district administration or ACP headquarters office,” he said.The Haryana government on Monday evening imposed a night curfew from 9pm to 5am, prohibiting the movement of people not involved in essential services. The decision was taken after the number of Covid-19 cases spiralled in the state with Gurugram adding more than 1,000 cases per day since Sunday. Last week, Delhi and Noida imposed a curfew between 10pm and 5am to check the spread of the infection.The police said that all market associations were informed of the orders and asked to ensure that all shops are shut by 9pm, failing which strict action would be taken. On Monday night, liquor shops and restaurants were found open till late night on Sohna Road, Golf Course Road, Sector 14, Sector 31, Sector 15 and Golf Course Extension Road, following which enforcement has been increased, said officials.Rao said that strict action, under applicable sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), will be taken against those violating the prohibitory orders. “Our teams are checking suspected vehicles and identity cards at checkpoints within the city and the borders. Also, we have requested people to ensure that no gathering or movement of more than four persons takes place,” Rao said.As part of the deployment plan, 79 police control room (PCR) vans and 123 patrol bikes were pressed into service, while 61 checkpoints were created across the city. Personnel deployed at Police Lines were also deployed to keep a check on the night movement.Five PCR vans and six motorbikes were also stationed at the Sirhaul border, Kherki Daula toll plaza, Sohna Road and Bilaspur crossing for ensuring law and order is maintained. Rao said that 10 PCR vans and 12 motorbikes will also patrol the Delhi-Jaipur Expressway to keep a check on unnecessary movement.The police said that the deployment of personnel and vehicles were done in a manner to ensure quick response across their jurisdictions and that all vehicles are equipped with GPS and wireless communication systems for better coordination.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/night-curfew-to-kick-in-at-10pm-cops-deployed-101618336602042.html

13-04-2021||Noida||‘Tika utsav’: Ghaziabad, GB Nagar fall short of vaccination target||During the first three days of the four-day “tika utsav”, Ghaziabad and Gautam Budh Nagar fell short of their daily vaccination target. Officials from both districts attributed the reason to diverting resources towards Covid-19 management duties such as enforcement, testing and surveillance. However, a few doctors said they also had to contend with the lack of vaccines.Tika utsave, or vaccination festival, was coined by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Amid a rapid surge in Covid-19 cases, Modi, in his recent interaction with chief ministers, had proposed for four days starting from Sunday to ensure maximum participants in the vaccination drive. At present, those above 45 years of age are eligible to get the anti-Covid shot.According to official records, Ghaziabad had vaccinated 32,358 people, while Gautam Budh Nagar vaccinated 25,070 till date.The Uttar Pradesh government had given targets to each of the 75 districts. Gautam Budh Nagar and Ghaziabad were vaccinate 18000 people each on April 11, and 35,000 each on April 12 and April 13. Instead, Ghaziabad vaccinated 8,112 people on April 11, 13,750 on April 12 and 10,496 on April 13. Similarly, the official records of GB Nagar health department stated that 6553 were vaccinated on April 11, 10787 on April 12 and 7730 on April 13. According to figures, Ghaziabad’s coverage stood at 36.77% while GB Nagar’s coverage stood at 28.48% for three days against target of 88000 each.The experts said that the coverage was not up to the mark considering target given. “During the last week, there were issues of short supply of vaccine. When the fresh stock arrived, they were distributed to different Covid vaccination centres. Although the target given was on higher side, but more could have been achieved with prior supply of vaccine and proper resource management. So, regular supply is must,” said Dr VB Jindal, former president of Indian Medical Association (IMA - Ghaziabad). “Vaccination has become vital in times when infection is spreading. There is lot of reluctance among people to get vaccinated. So, more awareness is to be spread and people should be motivated to come to Covid vaccination centres (CVCs). We also suggest that vaccination should be a comprehensive program and clinics should also be authorised to administer doses,” said Dr Ashish Agarwal, president of IMA, Ghaziabad. Ahead of the “tika utsav”, both the districts received fresh supply of 80,000 doses each. GB Nagar received doses on the night of April 10 from Agra depot while Ghaziabad received their stock on morning of April 11 after which it was distributed to different CVCs. “We fell short as we had to devote our resources to Covid management also. With the available resources, we could have achieved 15000-18000 per day on limited number of days. However, we achieved 100% target in the month of March and this month’s target will also be achieved,” said Suhas LY, district magistrate of GB Nagar. Ghaziabad district magistrate could not be reached despite repeated calls made to him. “Our achievement fell short of target as our manpower was also busy with Covid duties.

The number of positive samples will be higher than infections as a person may have had multiple tests.Records with the health department indicated that three residential segments of Indirapuram, Carte and Vaishali now have more than 100 cases each -- a throwback to last year when these areas showed the highest incidents of the disease in the district. Of the total cases in April so far, the worst affected is the Karhera II residential segment which includes Indirapuram with 148 cases at present against 63 reported in March. The other segment of Carte, which comprises of localities like Shastri Nagar, Chiranjeev Vihar among others, have 148 cases at present with 90 reported in March. Vaishali with 120 cases is also among the three segments registering over 100 overall cases in April as against 51 in the month of March. Likewise, Sahibabad (I and II) segment has 96 cases in April and Vasundhara with 52 cases besides Vijay Nagar (I and II) with 82 cases in first 12 days of April. “As directed, we are taking up speedy testing, tracing and surveillance in high case load localities. Our teams are regularly monitoring such areas and even contact tracing has been expedited,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer. Dr VB Jindal, former president of Indian Medical Association (Ghaziabad) said that rise in positivity and cases could be result of lack of enforcement and awareness among masses. “It is vital that proper regulation in containment zones is carried out and it is to be ensured that patients strictly stay at home when in home isolation. Among the masses, there is urgent need to spread awareness to adhere to Covid-appropriate behaviour. If these can be enforced, it will help prevent spread, otherwise, we may be looking at lockdown to control cases and spread of infection,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/ghaziabad-tally-in-12-days-of-april-double-of-cases-last-month-101618336242137.html

A quarter of the occupation is by people from outside the district, according to official records.The district has capacity to provide beds to over 2,450 patients in the district.GB Nagar district magistrate Suhas LY, said that private Covid-dedicated facilities had been asked to reserve at least 50% of their beds for the residents of the district. According to him, a hospital can turn away a patient from outside the district in case they have filled their quota.The DM also said that considering the need of isolation and ICU beds, the district health department had put the cap on the rates for the private hospitals. “The private hospitals have been divided into two different categories -- National Accreditation Board for Hospitals and Healthcare Providers (NABH)-accredited and non-NABH accredited. Even the patients have been categorised in three groups – moderate, severe and very severe. The rates for NABH-accredited hospitals vary from ₹10,000 to ₹18,000 per day, including the cost of PPE kits. For the non-NABH category, the rates vary from ₹8,000 to ₹15,000 per day, including the cost of PPE kits,” he said. Suhas said 426 asymptomatic patients were in home isolation. “Our home isolation cell in the integrated command call centre is keeping a close tab on the health conditions of these patients. So far, we have taken eight of them to the covid-dedicated facilities. Four of the home isolated persons are not the residents of GB Nagar,” he said. Chief medical officer (CMO), Dr Deepak Ohri said that on the basis of the data given by the home isolation cell about the overseas travellers, our surveillance team is doing the contact tracing of all of them. “We are keeping a close tab on the persons, who have recently travelled to foreign countries in the recent past. As per the cell’s records, there are altogether 225 international travellers in the district, including 198 from United Kingdom, 17 from South Africa, eight from Brazil and two from USA,” he said. Additional chief medical officer (ACMO), Dr Neeraj Tyagi, who is the in-charge of vaccination in the district said that on the third day of four-day special vaccination drive (tika utsav), as many as 7,730 persons took their jabs on Tuesday. “As many 2,195 senior citizens took their jabs, out of which 555 were the second dose recipients.

13-04-2021||Noida||Ghaziabad, Gautam Budh Nagar exceed UP’s new minimum testing targets||Chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Tuesday ordered the health department to increase molecular testing for Covid-19, also called RT-PCR testing, to about 150,000 per day across the state to break the chain of infection.In December, Gautam Budh Nagar was given a target of 1,750 RT-PCR tests daily will now have to test 3,500. Ghaziabad’s target remained unchanged at 1,700. Officials from both districts said they were already operating in excess of these numbers.Overall, the state is currently targeting a testing rate of 100,000 antigen tests and 75,000 RT-PCR tests, said Amit Mohan Prasad, UP’s additional chief secretary (health) on Tuesday. The state had tested over 37 million samples till date, he added.“We are exceeding the target,” said Prasad. “We tested 218,965 samples in the last 24 hours and a little over 97,000 of these were through RT-PCR method.”RT-PCR, or reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, is considered more accurate than antigen tests, which is faster and cheaper.“We are conducting about 5,000 tests per day of which over 2,000 are RT-PCR tests per day. We can further scale RT-PCR testing if positivity [rate of positive cases per 100 tests] increases further. But we need to increase testing capacity,” said Suhas LY, district magistrate of GB Nagar.Gims officials said that could testing up to 6,000-8,000 tests per day.“At present, we are conducting 2,800-3,000 tests per day. We get samples from Ghaziabad, Saharanpur and Hapur districts and giving test results within 24 hours. Sometimes it may get delayed depending upon the quality of sample sent to us. Both GB Nagar and Ghaziabad are sending about 1,500 to 2,000 samples per day,” said Brig (retd) Rakesh Gupta, director of GIMS.Ghaziabad had seen a sharp spike in cases over the last month and has increased its testing that had slacked during the first three months.“For about 10 days now we are testing 5,500-6,000 samples per day. We can scale RT-PCR tests further if required. But the results should be provided timely, ideally within 24 hours,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer of Ghaziabad.Ghaziabad officials said they were sending samples also to MMG Hospital. An officer at the hospital, requesting anonymity, said, “We are catering to about 700-800 daily samples and can scale up testing to about 2000 if we get the computerised extractor unit. We are sending our results within 24 hours from the time we receive samples.”District magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey was unavailable for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/ghaziabad-gautam-budh-nagar-exceed-up-s-new-minimum-testing-targets-101618335822091.html

The Bagh, which was closed for restoration work around one-and-half years ago, was out of bounds for the visitors, including the family members of some of those who fell to bullets of British soldiers commanded by General Reginald Dyer on April 13, 1919. No one from the state or central government turned up even for the symbolic commemoration. Jallianwala Bagh Shaheed Parivar Samiti president Mahesh Behal whose grandfather Hari Ram was killed in the massacre said, “We requested that at least I should be allowed to go up to the memorial. However, the security personnel did not allow even one person inside. This is not fair. They should have eased the restrictions for today at least.” A group of farmers owing allegiance to Azad Kisan Sangharsh Committee turned up there raising slogans in favour of the martyrs. They also tried to enter the garden but security personnel didn’t let them in. Farmers then raised slogans against the government. Jallianwala Bagh National Memorial Trust member and Rajya Sabha MP Shwait Malik reiterated that the revamped memorial would have been reopened this Baisakhi, but the Covid-19 norms turned out to be a hurdle in the way.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/no-ceremony-at-jallianwala-bagh-for-second-consecutive-baisakhi-101618334324405.html

The boy hit the bed-ridden woman with an iron rod and when she died, he set her on fire. To hoodwink his parents, he concocted a story that some outsiders had attacked the house but confessed to the crime during police questioning. The teenager, a Class 12 student, revealed that he was fed up with his grandmother as she often scolded him and wanted to get rid of her. He said he took cues from television shows to plan the murder. On Monday afternoon, when his parents had gone to the market to shop for their wedding anniversary, he allegedly killed the old woman. He then rang up his parents to inform them that four unidentified persons had come with an intention to loot the house and had set the grandma’s room on fire. When the couple returned, they found their son lying in a bed box with limbs tied. They were told that the attackers had threatened to wipe out the entire family. The family informed the police and requested them to trace the culprits. However, on Tuesday, when the investigation team led by SP (investigation) Ravinder Pal Singh Sandhu quizzed the teenager, he broke down and confessed to having committed the crime. “The boy said he was inspired by the crime serials and had been planning the murder for quite some time. When he got the opportunity on Monday, he executed the plan,” said Sandhu. Senior superintendent of police Navjot Singh Mahal said the accused was sent to a juvenile home. “Since he is a minor, we did not ask for his police remand,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/teenager-held-for-killing-grandmother-says-took-cues-from-tv-crime-shows-101618333909510.html

Earlier, the cabinet minister also unveiled the 8.5 km and 100 feet wide approach road — connecting Chandigarh Road to the cycle valley — constructed at a cost of ₹66 crore.He was accompanied by Hero Motors Company CMD Pankaj Munjal, Punjab Small and Export Corporation chairman Gurpreet Singh Bassi, Punjab Medium Industrial Development Board chairman Amarjit Singh Tikka and others.Arora said that the new hi-end export-oriented manufacturing plant at the cycle valley will help generate thousands of jobs, while marking a major leap for the Make in India initiative. He said that the opening of the new plant by Hero Motors marks the first phase of operationalisation of the cycle valley.While speaking on the occasion, Pankaj Munjal informed that the cycle valley is a critical element in establishing Hero Motors’ global engineering and manufacturing chain with R&D facilities centred in Europe and manufacturing in India.He said that Hero E Cycles Ltd factory is a major component of Hero Motors Company’s ambition to make India a global manufacturing hub of premium bicycles and e-cycles.He added that the factory will help Hero Motors augment its manufacture capacity to 10 million units annually, with a production of four million premium bicycles and e-cycles, majorly for global consumption. Along with the new plant, the cycle valley will also house a series of international component suppliers to achieve complete localisation of manufacturing in India.Spread across a sprawling 380 acres of land, the cycle valley is expected to employ over 9,000 people when fully operational. The park is establishing a complete ecosystem for international component suppliers to localise production and help India eliminate its dependence on premium component imports.Munjal said talks are on with several foreign companies for joint ventures as a number of major players have decided to set up their mega units here. He said that very soon, many other companies would also be setting up their units in Dhanansu. It would not only boost the economy of the state but also generate employment for thousands of Punjabi youths, he added.While 50 acres of the valley houses the e-cycles factory, another 50 acres has been marked for a dedicated suppliers’ park. Munjal said that over ₹1,000 crore is being undertaken over two years in total to operationalise the e-cycle valley and grow Hero International in the EU and UK.While Hero Motors is spending ₹350 crore in operationalising the valley, the vendors are bringing in an estimated ₹400 crore. Additionally, it plans to further invest ₹300 crore over the next couple of years to fortify its brands, R&D and distribution across the EU and UK.Munjal said that the firm was already in advanced talks to finalise a joint venture with an international player for electric motor localization and another JV for manufacturing international quality alloy frames, suspension and CVT in India.

Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray said in his address to people of the state that the curfew will come into effect from 8pm on Wednesday. “ ₹5400 crore will be used to support people during this period,” Thackeray said during his address.Under the Maha Vikas Aghadi government's flagship economy meal scheme, Shiv Bhojan Thali, food will also be distributed for one month. The meal distribution scheme, which was launched by the state’s food and civil supplies minister Chhagan Bhujbal on January 26, was provided to needy individuals during last year’s lockdown period for ₹5, but for the next one month, it will be distributed free. “Shiv Bhojan thalis will be given free for the next one month. The state gives around 200,000 thalis daily,” Thackeray said during his address.Thackeray also announced an initiative to distribute ration consisting of 3 kilograms of wheat and 2 kilograms of rice for a month. “Three kg wheat and 2 kg rice will be provided for one month to 7 crore people,” Uddhav Thackeray said during his address.The chief minister also announced a cash transfer scheme for registered construction workers, where Rs.1500 will be distributed to some 12 crore individuals working in the construction sector. “Twelve crore registered building and other construction workers will be given ₹1500 each,” said Thackeray.Thackeray also asked for an extension on the deadline for filing Goods and Service Tax (GST) returns of small and medium enterprises by three months as businesses have been left reeling under the wrath of the second wave.“Another demand is to push the deadline by three months to file GST returns of small and medium enterprises,” he said.Thackeray’s announcement of assistance comes after the comments of opposition leader Devendra Fadnavis earlier this month, asking the government to provide financial assistance to the poor and middle class if a lockdown-like situation arises. "Lockdown or a partial lockdown is okay. We will support the government, but it should also focus on providing financial assistance to the poor and the middle class," Fadnavis said to reporters on April 4.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/monetary-assistance-free-food-during-curfew-in-maharashtra-uddhav-thackeray-announces-101618331540230.html

13-04-2021||Ranchi||Covid-19 situation worsening, swift measures should be taken: HC||The Jharkhand high court on Tuesday observed that the Covid-19 scenario in the state was worsening with each passing day and it will be difficult to control if things were not spruced up immediately. A division bench of chief justice Dr Ravi Ranjan and justice Sujit Narayan Prasad pulled up state authorities over lack of health care and services even after a year of the outbreak. “A year has already elapsed since the outbreak of this pandemic. We were expecting that the government must have set up adequate arrangements and streamlined the system to meet such medical exigencies. But, unfortunately, nothing much has been done. We still face shortage of beds in hospitals, delay in sample testing, death of patients in want of treatment and many more troubles,” the bench observed.It said even the state’s biggest Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences (RIMS) has only three RT-PCR machines.“More than 5,000 untested samples are piled up in this hospital alone. Government is sending samples to other states for testing. This indicates lack of preparedness. The situation will worsen if not controlled immediately. Adequate and swift measures must be taken. Every stakeholders is required to work sincerely in this difficult time,” the bench stated.It suggested the government to set up isolation centres in hotels and banquet halls, and asked to furnish a progress report on the whole issue by April 17, the next date of hearing.The court pointed out that it was hearing a matter related to mismanagement in RIMS for last one year and passing orders from time-to-time to improve its condition but to no avail.“The hospital, which is generally flooded with patients from across the state, doesn’t have many important testing machines. There is a paucity of technicians and other staff. In current situation, this medical institution is overburdened with patients and it is finding it difficult to handle the rush,” the bench said.Advocate general Rajiv Ranjan, however, informed the court that all private hospitals were directed to reserve 50% beds for Covid-19 patients. “The state is testing more than 35,000 samples everyday. RIMS governing body is slated to meet to discuss matters related to purchase of CT scan machines and others. The government is handling the Covid-19 scenario with all sincerity,” he argued.Earlier, the HC took serious exception to the fact that reports of samples collected from over 70 court staff on April 5 were yet to be generated. It also took notice of the fact that an electric crematorium set up in Ranchi for disposal of bodies of Covid-19 casualties was not functioning and bodies were piled up.Earlier on Monday, the court asked a slew of top officials, including health department’s principal secretary, Ranchi deputy commissioner and others, to appear before it through videoconferencing.The court was informed that the electric crematorium at Ranchi’s Harmu will be repaired in a day. Another electric crematorium at Ghagra will be made functional soon. Proper arrangements have been made for disposal of infected bodies, officials concerned said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/covid19-situation-worsening-swift-measures-should-be-taken-hc-101618331501789.html

A senior doctor in the pulmonary medicine department, re-employed post superannuation, has also tested positive for the virus on Tuesday,” said PMCH principal Dr Vidyapati Choudhary. “Though asymptomatic, I decided to get myself tested after my daughter, who is doing her internship at the Patna Dental College, got infected. I am now under home quarantine,” added Dr Choudhary. “The doctors infected include four resident doctors of the medicine department, two tutors of microbiology department, a postgraduate student of ENT, a senior resident of the department of surgery and another of clinical pathology,” said Dr Thakur. “This is the second time the senior resident from the surgery department has contracted the infection.

The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) solid waste management department has floated a tender to clear 70,000 tonnes of garbage lying at Ramtekdi industrial plot in Hadapsar and build a new 200-metric tons plant at Urali Devachi. In the Ramtekdi industrial area, the PMC possesses more than 10 acres of land for processing garbage. There are three processing plants, Rochem separation system, Adarsh processing unit and the Pune bio-energy company which is set to begin. The city generates around 2,600 tonnes of garbage daily. Of that, almost 300 metric tonnes of garbage has not been processed from the last nine months as Ramtekdi based garbage processing units are not running with full capacity. Therefore, there is 70,000 tonnes of garbage lying without processing at Ramtekdi industrial area. Ajit Deshmukh, deputy municipal commissioner said, the PMC solid waste department has admitted the piling up of unprocessed garbage in Ramtekdi. “In the Ramtekdi industrial area, the PMC has given a contract to Rochem company to process 700 metric tonnes of garbage per day. However, the company is processing only 200 metric tonnes of garbage per day. We have initiated a process to terminate the contract.” Solution on the way Deshmukh further said, “Now, the Pune bio-energy company has started a trial of the processing plant which has a capacity of processing 700 metric tonnes per day. It will start processing 350 metric tonnes of garbage per day in two-three days. After that, it will gradually increase capacity up to 700 metric tonnes until the month of September. Therefore, the problem of unprocessed garbage will be solved within one week.” “Due to the under-capacityprocessing of garbage, a total of 300 tonnes of garbage piles up in the Ramtekdi industrial area daily from the last nine months. The garbage has reached 70,000 tonnes. We have floated a tender to process and clear the garbage and given six months of time for that,” he added. New plant at Uruli Devachi The PMC will set up another plant of 200 metric tonnes in Uruli Devachi garbage depot; however, villagers from Uruli Devachi and Phursungi are opposing the plant. The Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) has given permission to set up a plant in the depot which will solve the issue. As per the National Green Tribunal (NGT) directives, the PMC stopped open dumping of garbage at Uruli Devachi garbage depot from January 1, 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/out-of-whack-machinery-piles-up-70-000-tonnes-garbage-at-ramtekdi-processing-plant-101618330661752.html

Rest all the flat owners accepted the compensation but as three members from three different buildings did not accept it, the land acquisition process remained incomplete.” PMC engineer Rajiv Thorat said, “The PMC filed a review petition in the high court for getting the possession earlier. The Ved bhavan also went to court, the government had given the land to this institute. It was a written clause that whenever needed, the Ved bhavan would return the land to the government, but they too went to court. The PMC requires the land for the multilevel flyover.” All the properties are on Sringeri Math road. Considering the heavy traffic in the area and a busy junction where city’s traffic mixes with the highway traffic, the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) stepped in to solve the traffic issues and complete the project. The PMC is providing land for this project; the state government has given the land acquisition cost to the PMC. The Chandni Chowk flyover work got much delayed due to land acquisition issue. Though the project got an approval almost three years ago, it is getting halted due to the land acquisition issue. The defense had given a nod to hand over the required land for this project. A PMC official said that the work of flyover is in progress. “Though these properties are not in the possession, it is not halting the work,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/court-cases-hinder-chandani-chowk-improvement-works-101618330481773.html
13-04-2021||Pune||An uphill task: Parents juggle between working from home and managing toddlers||With day-cares and play schools closed in Pune, working parents are facing a tough time managing work from home, household chores and baby care all at once. In an attempt to find a solution, working parents are now preferring to stay in their hometown or at their in-laws instead of a nuclear setup in Pune. Since April 3, many playgroups and day-cares have decided to shut voluntarily as precautionary measures. There was no mention in the state order to close down day-care centres. “With the spike in Covid cases, we kept the centre closed and we had also prepared a circular to open it again from April 15th but now all things depend on chief minister Uddhav Thackeray’s lockdown decision,” said Monika Kulkarni, director of Aajol who has 22 day-care centres in Pune. “Things have been hard with handling my 5-year-old son and managing work from home. If the lockdown extends, I will prefer to go back to Amravati and I hope travelling is allowed,” said Shruti Sinha, IT professional, and a resident of Hinjewadi. The concern for day care was the risk of a child testing positive for Covid-19, hence they preferred shutting down completely. “We have our SOPs, but we could not risk keeping our centres open. Parents are willing to send their kids back to day-care to decrease their workload,” said Kulkarni. Riya Marne, a housewife who has already returned to Yavatmal said,’ “I was in two minds before going to my in-laws as cases are increasing but doing office work and handling my 4-year-old daughter was not possible. Now, my mother-in-law handles the daughter.” Opting for online options Many playgroup schools in the city have started one-hour online session where they engage kids below six in various activities. “Business has already been hit badly with the current scenario but the online is one option which parents are showing interest in as the kids are learning something good in their screen time,” said Meenal Dand, teacher from Little Millennium School, Aundh. “In this age group (below 6) we will also like for physical classes but with no option left we are running online classes where we are conducting dance classes and fancy-dress competition as well,” added Dand.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/an-uphill-task-parents-juggle-between-working-from-home-and-managing-toddlers-101618330301722.html
13-04-2021||Pune||Liquor shops unwilling to home deliver despite mayor’s permission||Liquor shops within the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) are giving a lukewarm response to Pune mayor Murlidhar Mohol’s decision of permitting home delivery of liquor from Monday to Friday between 7 am to 6 pm. The demand for liquor is overwhelming, however, business owners fear crowding outside the shop, if they open shutters for home delivery. Ajay Deshmukh, secretary of the Pune liquor association and owner of Ajay Wines said, “I am not doing it and many of my fellow businessmen are also not doing it for the main reason that once we open our shutters, the crowd starts showing up and then police harass us. In many cases, shop owners were taken to police stations on the charge of allowing crowds at their shops. Since Section 144 is applicable, it is tough to avoid crowds.” The liquor shops have been shut from April 2 to curtail the further spread of the virus. However, the excise department has been hit by huge revenue loss. Last year too, the state excise department allowed the home delivery of alcohol but received a lukewarm response. This year, people can order during specific timings. GSP wines in Aundh has put up a board with a contact number for home delivery but people hover around waiting for the shop to open its shutters. “It is an overwhelming response, that is difficult to handle and tiring. In a day, we are doing 34 to 35 deliveries and I have four of my staff ready to help. We have down the shutters, and I have bouncers to help maintain social distance for people still come to the shutters and bang on it,” said Raj Bhagiya, owner of GSP wines. Mahendra Ghule of Ghule wines is finding replying to the phone calls difficult. “Ever since the mayor announced it, people are calling nonstop and asking for a lot of stock which is slowly depleting. If things don’t slow down, we will have to stop this service,” said Ghule. The PMC has around 170 shops, while the district has around 270 shops of which hardly 10-12 shops might be doing home delivery, but the loss of business is huge. “In Pune we are paying almost Rs1 lakh per month as licence fee which is heavy. Also, during the lockdown, we need to pay our staff, electricity as usual. It comes with a heavy blow,” added Deshmukh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/liquor-shops-unwilling-to-home-deliver-despite-mayor-s-permission-101618330241763.html

We also provided the online buying option to our customers and had kept the facility open until 5 pm on Monday, so that gold can be delivered on the festive occasion. People look forward to getting the gold on Gudi Padwa,” said Amit Modak, director-CEO, PN Gadgil and Sons. There is often a great deal of buzz in the jewellery market on Gudi Padwa which is considered to be an auspicious day to buy gold, however, with restrictions on movement in place, jewellers kept their businesses shut. Fattechand Ranka, president of the Maharashtra Rajya Saraf Suvarnakar Federation and managing director of Ranka jewellers admitted that there’s no personal touch for customers in the online purchase of gold. “All the Sarafa market is closed in Pune, only the online purchase option is available. We are getting a usual response for online gold purchase. Of course, there is the personal touch missing. People mostly buy pure gold online. There is a home delivery facility for online purchase. They get home delivery after 2-3 days,” Ranka said. The rate of 24 carat gold in Pune on Tuesday was ₹45,760 per 10 gram whereas 22 carat gold cost ₹44,760 per 10 gram. Despite the fact that the online booking and home delivery option has been available for gold purchase, jewellers say that there is still a limit to online booking and people still prefer to buy gold in person. “People are opting out to buy gold or diamond online but if you compare it with the usual sale in the shops it is not even 1 percent of it. People usually prefer to purchase heavy gold items in person. Online purchases mostly range up to 20,000 for light items. Online gold purchase has limits and we are aware of that, doesn’t matter how much concession we give, people still prefer to buy gold in person. It was still not clear to people if shops are going to be closed or open till Sunday. So they couldn’t decide whether to buy online or wait to go to the shops. So, there were fewer bookings online as well,” said Modak. Car dealers in the city also provided home delivery to their customers on the occasion of Gudi Padwa as automobile showrooms were also closed in the city. Anant Gajendragadkar, a resident of Kothrud got his brand-new car home delivered on Tuesday. “I had booked this car three weeks ago. Of course, I would have liked to go to the showroom and bring my new car home, but the situation is different now. We all should take care as much as possible,” Gajendragadkar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/jewellers-home-deliver-gold-on-gudi-padwa-sales-take-a-hit-101618330181753.html

While staff at Baikunth Dham and Gulalaghat were working day and night to end the waiting list for last rites, cremation of Covid positive bodies was not allowed at the Alambagh crematorium. “The influx of bodies has increased in the last few days. Normally, 10 to 15 bodies are cremated in a traditional way every day and around 5 to 10 are cremated in the electric crematorium at Bhainsakund,” said Ram Nageena Tripathi, in-charge of city crematoriums. “At Gulalaghat, 7 to 10 bodies are usually cremated in a traditional way and 4 to 6 are cremated in the electric crematorium. But all of a sudden, the number of bodies has doubled at these crematoriums since last Friday,” he added. On Sunday, 42 bodies were brought to Bhainsakund and 27 at Gulalaghat while on Monday Bhainsakund received 57 bodies and Gulalaghat 29. Most of these were Covid positive bodies. On Tuesday till 3.30pm, 57 bodies had been brought for cremation, 38 at Bhainsakund and 19 at Gulalaghat, said Tripathi. BODIES FROM OTHER DISTRICTS ALSO He said many bodies were from adjacent places where cremation of Covid positive bodies was not possible. “No one is willing to touch these bodies in other districts, but here we have trained manpower for cremation of infected bodies and that’s why bodies from Sitapur, Baranbanki, Rae Bareli, Hardoi, Jagdishpur, Sultanpur are sent here for cremation,” added Tripathi. 100 WORKERS FOR CARRYING BODIES The Lucknow Municipal Corporation has hired 100 labourers on contract to properly carry infected bodies from the bus to the cremation platforms. These workers would be provided PPE kits, gloves and sanitisers. They will work in two shifts, said municipal commissioner Ajay Dwivedi. 50 EXTRA PLATFORMS The corporation has raised 50 extra platforms for cremation of bodies at Bhaisakund and Gulalaghat, he added. NO WOOD SHORTAGE NOW There was a shortage of wood at the cremation grounds during the last three days because of a large number of cremations, but the problem has been sorted out, said municipal commissioner Ajay Dwivedi. Five more incinerators would be placed at Gulalaghat, Bhainsakund and Alambagh crematoria within 15 days, he said. Currently, there are two machines at Baikunth Dham (Bhainsakund), one of which is around 30 years old, so it would be replaced by a new one, while two more machines will be installed bringing the number to four, added Dwivedi. “Gulalaghat and Alambagh will get one new machine each,” he said. VEHICLES TOWED AWAY Parking has become a problem in front of the Bhainsakund cremation ground due to more cremations. A number of vehicles were towed away by the private contractor hired by the LMC for towing vehicles. Many people accused him of extortion. However, the allegations of charging penalty were refuted by an IPS officer on twitter, with a warning of action against those who spread rumours about challans. SIMILAR SCENE AT GRAVEYARDS Graveyards and cemeteries in the city also saw an increased number of burials. Maulana Khalid Rasheed Farangi Mahali, Imam, Eidgah, said he had never seen so many burials together. He also requested people to stay indoors and to strictly follow Covid-19 protocols.

The Yamuna provides 40% of the water produced in Delhi every day,” Chadha, also an Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader, said at a press conference.ऐसे समय में जब नवरात्रे है, रमजान भी है और कोरोना महामारी चरम पर है तब हरियाणा सरकार दिल्ली में भारी मात्रा में अमोनिया, गंदगी, Untreated Waste वाला पानी भेज रही है, जिसे कोई विश्वस्तरीय Plant भी Treat नहीं कर सकता। - @Raghav_Chadha pic.twitter.com/jC95YgfhX4“Several areas of Delhi, including North Delhi, South Delhi, Central Delhi and West Delhi will be affected as Haryana is not honouring even its legal commitment as directed by the Supreme Court with regards to the clean water that it has to supply to Delhi. Haryana is indulging in criminal negligence,” Chadha, who took over as the DJB vice chairperson in March 2020, said. He added that Haryana was “wilfully violating the right to life of the 22 million residents of Delhi.”South Delhi, North Delhi, Central और West Delhi पानी की Supply से प्रभावित होने वाला है, क्योंकि हरियाणा सुप्रीम कोर्ट के Order के बाद भी दिल्ली को साफ और पर्याप्त मात्रा में पानी नहीं दे रहा है।हरियाणा आपराधिक लापरवाही कर रहा है। - @Raghav_Chadha pic.twitter.com/y8S1PU7sSLNoting that the Delhi government has approached the Supreme Court in this regard, the AAP leader also said DJB has written several times in the last 15-20 days to Haryana over the rising levels of ammonia in the Yamuna. Chadha further urged Haryana to realise its responsibility to not play with the lives of the people of Delhi.हमने Supreme Court का दरवाजा भी खटखटाया है और 15-20 दिन से लगातार हरियाणा सरकार को पानी मे Ammonia की मात्रा को लेकर पत्र भी लिखा है। लेकिन हरियाणा सरकार आँखे मूंद कर बैठी है। हम हरियाणा सरकार से मांग करते है कि वो दिल्ली को साफ और पूरा पानी दे। -@Raghav_Chadha pic.twitter.com/cb8ix9aYLUDelhi and Haryana have been, for years, involved in a dispute over the sharing of the water of the Yamuna.

It argued the order came even as the high court had reserved its judgment on the maintainability of the suit pending in the Varanasi court. “The [Varanasi] court should not have passed any order in the suit till the issue of maintainability of the suit was decided,” said SFA Naqvi, the committee’s lawyer.“Further, the lower court ignored the entire written submissions and the applicability of the Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act, 1991 and Order 7 Rule 11D of the Civil Procedure Code while passing the order.”The 1991 law froze lawsuits to reclaim any place of worship after India was declared independent, except Ayodhya. The Supreme Court last month agreed to review the Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act.On April 8, civil judge (senior division) Ashutosh Tiwari ordered the formation of a five-member committee, comprising two Hindu, two Muslim members, and an archaeological expert, to oversee the “comprehensive physical survey” of the centuries-old Gyanvapi mosque complex. The plea in the case contended the mosque in Varanasi was a part of the temple.The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) will conduct the exercise without any media briefings, Tiwari ordered as he fixed May 31 as the next date of hearing.“This court finds that survey by ASI alone can bring the truth of the matter before this court. Irrespective of what surfaces, the survey by ASI may go on to help not only to the plaintiffs but also to the defendants, if their version is indeed true,” the lower court order said.The order was passed in a 1991 suit stayed by the high court in 1998. The trial was re-commenced by the Varanasi court, which held that the stay stood vacated in light of the Supreme Court’s directions in the Asian Resurfacing of Road Agency Pvt Ltd case. The apex court had held in this case that a stay granted by a court will end on expiry of six months from the date of such order unless a similar extension is granted.The suit was filed in 1991 seeking restoration of the ancient temple at the site where the Gyanvapi mosque currently stands. On March 15, the high court reserved its judgment in various pleas challenging the maintainability of the 1991 suit before the Varanasi court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/gyanvapi-mosque-panel-files-plea-in-allahabad-hc-seeking-stay-on-asi-survey-101618315362043.html
13-04-2021||Other||Higher education a distant dream for students from outer Delhi||New Delhi: Vikram Dagar, 24, a resident of Najafgarh’s Issapur village, had to travel at least a 100 kilometres every day for three years to pursue a Bachelor of Science degree from Delhi University’s Deshbandhu College. He is now pursuing his postgraduate degree from DU’s Faculty of Law – over 40 kilometres way.“I don’t have time left for myself or engage in self-study. For residents of Najafgarh, the struggle is on two fronts – to get into DU and then find a way to access these colleges,” said Dagar, adding that he used to leave at 6.30 am and return home by 9.30 pm during his undergraduate degree days. “Since my village is at the far-end, even reaching the nearest metro by bus takes over an hour.”The 24-year-old said that this results in a lot of dropouts. “Colleges often do not offer hostels to those living within a 60-km radius. So, we have no option but to stay at our homes. Not everyone can afford to travel by metro or getting PG accommodations near campus. In the past four years, I have seen so many people drop out for this very reason. If there had been even one government college in Najafgarh, so many dropouts could have been avoided,” he said.This is a common concern among the community living in outer Delhi areas -- such as Najafgarh, Mundka, Ghumanhera, and Roshanpura – where despite the availability of lands, no government colleges have come up in the recent years, leaving the youth with few options for higher education.During the Delhi government’s annual budget last month, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia said that Delhi has not been able to “make higher education accessible to every child in the last 75 years due to increasing population”. The government said that despite an increase of 36.42% in the seats allotted for higher education and 66.44% in those for technical education, more needs to be done.Residents of these areas too said that the budget did not focus much on higher education. Jagbir Yadav, 60, a resident of Mundka village, said, “Though it is good that the government is talking about developing a sports university here, some attention has to be given towards regular undergraduate degree courses as well. Students here shift towards ITI or technical courses from private institutes and that does not give them the exposure available to students living in the main city.”Kartar Singh, general secretary of the Najafgarh Senior Citizens’ Association, said, “A generation was left behind in terms of education and development because there are hardly any colleges here. Those wishing to pursue higher education had to go towards the Haryana side or drop out of colleges. Lack of education and subsequently career opportunities led to some of our youngsters taking the wrong route and becoming outlaws. Else they too could have studied and contributed to development. It would have been good if the annual budget focused more on getting higher education work done.”Singh said that except Bhagini Nivedita College for women, nearest DU colleges were at least 20 km away and the other option for students residing in the areas is to study in IP university in Dwarka.The lack of colleges has impacted young women the most. Shiksha Rani, who teaches Political Science in Bhagini Nivedita College, said, “Najafgarh is a big area with around 70 villages under it and this is the only government college in the area for girls. Naturally, it isn’t enough. Families are not willing to let their daughters travel for longer distances to pursue education. So, they are either made to drop out or opt for distance education and since they are at home, parents insist for marriage. This affects women’s education in the area.In 1989, around 83 bighas of land was allotted to DU in Roshanpura, Najafgarh, to build a campus but the project is yet to start more than 30 years later. In 2019, the Delhi high court had also instructed the university to build the college “as early as possible”, depending on the “availability of budget”. The long-standing issue of creating an approach road to the college – which was one of the reasons for the delay – has been resolved for now, said DU acting vice-chancellor PC Joshi. He also said that university officials will soon visit these areas and start creating “facility centres” for students.“We have larger plans but for that we need funds which have to be generated in due course of time. We will be writing to central agencies for funds as well. But what we are going to begin with is creating facility centres in north-west, west, and east Delhi soon so that students don’t have to come to north campus for various kinds of work,” Joshi said.“As far as Roshanpura is concerned, there is a proposal for a college. We recently met the deputy chief minister and discussed this along with other things. The minister said it was a good idea and the Delhi government would help us in it,” he added.A Delhi government spokesperson said, “Work on the Sports University in Mundka is going on in full swing. Ghumanhera already has a higher education facility like District Institute of Education and Training (DIET). The government is making serious efforts to provide quality education in other areas of outer Delhi. This includes efforts like creating a Skill University as well.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/higher-education-a-distant-dream-for-students-from-outer-delhi-101618314402698.html
13-04-2021||Bangalore||Bangalore Talkies: Moonwalking at night on city streets||If you are asthmatic, don’t come to Bengaluru. If you have dust allergies, this ain’t the place for you. If you have balance issues, be especially careful as you pick your way through the mounds and valleys that have now become common here.Bengaluru’s streets are like moon craters. Why bother with Mars rovers, I say, when you can barely walk on Magadi road?Bengaluru recently got a new BBMP commissioner, Gaurav Gupta. He has his work cut out for him. The whole city has been dug up in an effort to “improve” city streets. For a citizen, this ham-fisted process is the opposite of user-friendly. They seem to be digging up all the roads in sequence, without finishing the work section by section. As a result, the whole city looks like a MGNREGA exercise gone wrong.Migrant construction workers sit on sidewalks with their cute children who play on the mounds of gravel, bricks and dirt. Pedestrians try valiantly to navigate the streets. Senior citizens have given up walking. Worst-affected are the pushcart fruit vendors who have no option but to share the single lane with honking automobiles. As for the wandering cows, where have they gone?Also Read | Bangalore Talkies: Blooming tabebuias and drooping jacarandasThis hits close to home for me because I fractured my big toe on one of these sidewalks. It happened a few months ago, on December 9-- exactly 10 days before my father passed away.One moment I was striding along in my white and red Jamdani saree. The next moment, one of the sidewalk tiles tilted like a garbage-can opener. I fell into the gutter, quite literally. There were blood and tears. I discovered that my great toe was fractured. A kind orthopedic doctor in nearby Frazer Town put what is called a buddy-bandage connecting my great toe with my middle toe. I was advised bedrest for the 2 to 3 weeks.Ten days later, on December 19, my father passed away. All through 2020, I had visited my ailing father pretty much every day. But I could not go and visit him during the last 10 days of his life. I was lying in bed, keeping my foot raised. The sequence of events filled me with guilt and regret until a kind friend told me, “Perhaps your absence was what was needed for your Dad’s soul to release itself from the earth. Because when loved ones hang around, the soul does not want to leave.”It is something that I think about constantly as I pick my way through my beloved city’s streets. I don’t step on the sidewalk tiles any more. Instead, I gingerly place one foot forward and then another. Muscle memory they say, lasts longer than other types of memories. This holds true for me. Every step is a test. Will I fall into the gutter or not?The dug up streets are particularly galling because this is Bengaluru. You see, this city has so much going for it. All the government needs to do is preserve. The weather is salubrious pretty much all year round. The people are genteel and largely welcoming. There is infectious start up energy all around, attracting the young and the curious from all parts of the world. Bengaluru is a land of lakes. The trees were planted by Hyder Ali and Tipu Sultan. There are ancient rock engravings right in Hebbal.Save Maharashtra, this city can hold its own in the sporting element too-- we have Dravid, Kumble, Padukone and Bhupathi. There are wildlife enthusiasts, thanks to access to the Nilgiri Biosphere nearby. There are conservation scientists like Ullas and Krithi Karanth, and philanthropists like Rohini Nilekani and Azim Premji. This surfeit of riches is perhaps why it is so galling when the politicians take a perfectly lovely city and mess it up.At the Bangalore International Centre, which today hosts more programmes than the much older India International Centre, the citizenry comes together to talk and bemoan their falling, failing city. Activists stand outside Town Hall and Freedom Park still carrying banners, trying to effect change.As for me, I want to join all these protests. For that, I have to get out of my own street, which I currently cannot, because you see-- and you know where I am going with this, right?-- it is all dug up.Sumukhi Suresh ought to do an episode in Pushpavalli about Bengaluru’s dug up streets. Perhaps then, the powers that be will pay attention.Shoba Narayan is waiting for the dust to clear as she kicks up some dirt, all while trying not to fall into the gutter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/bangalore-talkies-moonwalking-at-night-on-city-streets-101618313801915.html

13-04-2021||Chandigarh||75% quota in private jobs can trigger exodus: PHDCCI||Cautioning the Manohar Lal Khattar-led government about the disastrous effects of the 75% quota in private jobs for local candidates, the PHD Chamber of Commerce and Industry has said that the law will be a blow to the one nation, one market concept and trigger an exodus of investors from Haryana. Under the Haryana State Employment of Local Candidates Act, 2020, the private sector will have to employ 75% of local candidates with respect to posts where the gross monthly salary or wages are not more than ₹50,000. This Act applies to all companies, societies, trusts, limited liability partnership firms, and any person employing 10 or more people. Khattar held a virtual meeting with industry representatives in Haryana on March 25. Deputy chief minister and Jannayak Janata Party (JJP) leader Dushyant Chautala, who holds the industry portfolio, also sought suggestions from industry bodies in an attempt to allay fears of the private sector. The PHDCCI submitted its response and suggestions to the chief minister on April 8. PHDCCI president Sanjay Aggarwal said: “Ideally, the Haryana government should not have brought in this law reserving jobs for locals in the private sector. It’s a disaster when you stop people coming into your state. We have informed the CM that this legislation will have a disastrous effect in Haryana.” The PHD (Progress, Harmony, Development) Chamber of Commerce is a national apex chamber working at the grassroots with national and international linkages. It has listed six steps that Haryana should take while implementing the reservation rules so that the growth of the industry is not impacted. Reduce threshold salary level to ₹15,000 Asking Haryana to exempt special economic zones from this Act, the chamber has suggested reducing the threshold monthly salary level of ₹50,000 to ₹15,000. The ₹15,000 should be the total cost to the company and not basic salary that can be increased marginally every year with skill development taking place. Another step suggested is to reduce reservation in the beginning to 25% and increasing it over the next decade after skill development takes place. Aggarwal said the Haryana legislation violates the Constitution’s Article 14 (equality before law) and Article 19 that guarantees rights, including the one to reside and work in any part of the country. “Investors and businesses source the best human resources available to be competitive and successful. Hiring is done on the basis of merit and talent rather than domicile of the candidates,” he said, reminding the Haryana government about Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s catch phrase: Ek Bharat Shreshth Bharat. Law will set a wrong precedent: Industry body chief Stating that implementing the legislation just when business activities are picking up amid the pandemic can result in an exodus of investors from Haryana. The PHDCCI has told the state government that while many industries are in the process of starting their ventures in the rural areas, if the new law is implemented, it may not be easy to find skilled labour across bands to fulfil the reservation rule. “This law will set a wrong precedent. It is a negative step,” Aggarwal said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/75-quota-in-private-jobs-will-trigger-exodus-warns-phdcci-101618312121781.html
13-04-2021||Pune||Civic Sanskriti: Nature’s summer glory paints neighbourhood in a golden hue||There’s an Amaltas (Indian Laburnum, and Bahava in Marathi,) tree near my house. Come summer, and its golden glory lights up our neighbourhood. My daughter has had a special relationship with it, as her grandmother would assign her the task of fetching a sprig of flowers for the Vishukani, or decoration for Vishu. Vishu is the harvest festival in Kerala and the decorations include many “golden” items like the yellow cucumber, lemon, and mango. If the tree near our house does not flower in time, then another tree must be located. Harvest festivals like Vishu give even city dwellers an opportunity to connect with nature and thank her for the gifts that make our lives possible and beautiful. Observing nature in the neighbourhood can be rewarding for children and their teachers, care-givers and parents, whether its school holidays or studying (or even working) from home.Some favourite activities for exploring trees are by observing the variety of shapes, sizes and colour of leaves and bark, and touching and feeling the textures. The most fun activity is taking “leaf autographs” – put a leaf under a sheet of paper and run your pencil over it to reveal its shape and ridges.Nature painting and drawing by looking at real flowers and leaves is another wonderful way to improve children’s (and adults’) observation skills. It can be calming and satisfying. A fun practical trigonometry exercise is to measure the height of a tree. You don’t need to climb it, you just need a stick or pencil (see box).Certain trees are “keystone” species, meaning many other living beings are dependent on them, and without their presence, nature in that neighnourhood or ecosystem would be quite different. The banyan tree, for example, is a keystone species and a habitat in itself. It plays host to many types of insects including ants, bees, and butterflies, as well as spiders, lizards, birds, little mammals like squirrels and bats. Just watch the antics and interactions of these creatures.But today, we have to look for some flowering Amaltas trees for our Vishukani. . Our neighbourhood Amaltas is a little late in flowering this year. I wonder if the peak of the profuse abundant flowering of Amaltas occurs in Pune at least a couple of weeks later than in Kerala? I have enrolled in SeasonWatch, an India-wide programme that studies the changing seasons by monitoring the annual cycles of flowering, fruiting and leaf-flush of common trees. This long-running citizens’ science initiative has a website and an app. Students and anyone interested can join it. The organisers suggest that the observations of citizen scientists from different parts of India could help understand the impacts of climate change on nature. I plan to observe my neighbourhood bahava and contribute my observations. Wish you a Happy Baisakhi and Vishu!Pencil-rotation method to measure the height of a tree1.Hold pencil at arm’s length vertically2.Move toward or away from the tree to be measured until the base of the tree is aligned visually with the top of the hand at the base of the pencil, and the top of the tree is aligned with the top of the pencil3.Without moving the arm up or down rotate the pencil until it is horizontal and parallel to the ground. The base of the pencil should still be aligned with the base of the tree. 4.Ask your friend to stand at the spot on the ground that aligns with the top of the pencil. If alone, pick a distinctive point on the ground to mark this point. The distance from the base of the tree to this point is equal to the height of the tree.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/civic-sanskriti-nature-s-summer-glory-paints-neighbourhood-in-a-golden-hue-101618312002681.html

13-04-2021||Chandigarh||Centre’s policies in interest of corporates: Akal Takht jathedar||Akal Takht jathedar Giani Harpreet Singh on Tuesday charged the BJP-led Centre with working to benefit chosen corporate houses at the cost of the Sikh community’s economic interests. Addressing a religious gathering on Baisakhi, which marks the Khalsa foundation day at the historic Damdama Sahib gurdwara in Talwandi Sabo, the jathedar made an indirect reference to the farm laws, saying the Centre’s policies are aimed at hitting the agrarian and non-agricultural sections equally. “The communities may cease to exist if their economic sources are targeted. Ill-conceived government policies are to be blamed for the ongoing economic instability. New policies are being formulated keeping in view the interests of a few business families,” Giani Harpreet Singh said. Also read: Covid-19: Active caseload jumps by over 63,000, 5 states contribute 69%Calls for abstaining from drugs, deras The Damdama Sahib gurdwara is significant as Guru Gobind Singh, the tenth Sikh master, prepared the full version of Sri Guru Granth Sahib there in 1705. Giani Harpreet Singh called on members of the Sikh community to fight against drug abuse and shun following deras (sects). Huge rush of pilgrims amid Covid surge Owing to restrictions imposed after the Covid-19 pandemic, Baisakhi celebrations were low key last year as people were asked to stay home and celebrate the festival. However, this time, when cases are seeing a surge across the country, including Punjab, religious bodies have made large-scale arrangements to mark the festival. Covid guidelines were blatantly violated as there was an unchecked rush to devotees at the shrine since Monday night. Markets in the vicinity of the gurdwara were crowded and people were seen without masks and there was no enforcement of the protocol. There was no provision for thermal scanning. Authorities express inability to enforce guidelines Officials in the health department and civil administration expressed their inability to enforce the Covid guidelines. “Issuing challans may lead to a law and order situation in such a huge gathering. Last year, religious bodies had proactively appealed to devotees to hold special prayers and avoid visiting the shrine on Baisakhi and it got the desired results. But the virus infection threat is far more serious today and Talwandi Sabo is seeing such a big gathering,” an official said, requesting anonymity. Farmers’ rally organised near gurdwara Bhartiya Kisan Union (Ekta-Ugrhana) also held a kisan (farmers’) rally adjacent to the gurdwara to protest the farm laws. A large part of the gathering comprised elderly villagers and women.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/centres-policies-in-interest-of-corporates-akal-takht-jathedar-101618309421344.html

She went about with pouring colours on the palette, making swift brushstrokes, and soon she produced a painting, which she showed to the crowd as it cheered.Meanwhile, a defence official said that the area where Mamata Banerjee is staging a protest belongs to the army, and the TMC was yet to receive permission for the programme. "We received an application from Trinamool Congress (TMC) at 9:40 am, for a No Objection Certificate (NOC) for Kolkata's Gandhi Murti as the area falls under Army's jurisdiction. It is under process and NOC hasn't been issued yet," the official said, according to news agency ANI.Banerjee is staging the dharna as a mark of protest against what she called the EC's "unconstitutional decision" to bar her from campaigning for 24 hours in the ongoing state assembly polls. The poll body's order came after the chief minister's remarks against the central forces and a statement which had alleged religious overtones.The EC said that Banerjee had made "highly insinuating and provocative remarks laden with the serious potential of the breakdown of law and order and thereby affecting the election process" and advised her "to desist from using such statements while making public utterances during the period when Model Code of Conduct is in force."The next phase of West Bengal Assembly polls will be held on April 17. The counting of votes will take place on May 2.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/mamata-banerjee-on-dharna-against-ec-s-campaign-ban-takes-to-painting-101618300394944.html
13-04-2021||Chandigarh||Sikh pilgrims stranded in Lahore on Baisakhi amid clashes in Pakistan||Protests and road blockades across Pakistan following the arrest of a far right leader, Saad Hussain Rizvi, on Monday have left 818 Sikh pilgrims headed for Gurdwara Panja Sahib on the occasion of Baisakhi stranded en route. The jatha, which was accommodated at Gurdwara Dera Sahib in Lahore on Monday night, has not been able to proceed to Hasan Abdal, where the historic gurdwara is located, in view of the tension in Pakistan. Baisakhi is also celebrated as Khalsa Foundation Day and the jatha members, who left Amritsar on an enthusiastic note on Monday morning, are stranded in Lahore since Monday night. Inter-city highways were closed after protests in Karachi, Lahore and Islamabad. Local media reported clashes between police and protesters in Lahore. “We were stuck at Wagah border till 9.30pm on Monday after crossing over to Pakistan. We spent the entire day waiting in buses though arrangements of food and water were made for us. After Pakistan’s security forces got the roads cleared, we were taken to Gurdwara Dehra Sahib at 11.30pm,” Gurdev Singh, one of the pilgrims said over phone. Jatha at Gurdwara Dehra Sahib under tight security According to the original plan, the Sikh pilgrims were to reach Gurdwara Panja Sahib at Hasan Abdal on Monday directly to celebrate Baisakhi. Since there was no plan of staying in Lahore, the Pakistan government and the Pakistan Sikh Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (PSGPC) made arrangements for the stay of the jatha besides langar on the spot. “At present, the entire jatha is staying at Gurdwara Dehra Sahib under tight security. We are not sure when we will be able to go to Gurdwara Panja Sahib,” he said. Protests began after Saad Hussain Rizvi, the leader of the Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP), was arrested in Lahore on Monday. Leaders of his party alleged that the government had violated an agreement signed with the party in February to stave off the threat of further protests over perceived blasphemy by French President Emmanuel Macron. The TLP is demanding the expulsion of the French ambassador over the publication of blasphemous caricatures. Following news of Rizvi’s arrest, highways and roads were blocked by TLP workers in Karachi, Lahore, Rawalpindi and Islamabad. Families of pilgrims worried about their safety The pilgrims have not been able to contact their families in India as the internet connectivity is down there. PSGPC president Satwant Singh was not available for comment. No office-bearer of the committee came forward to offer an update on the situation, adding to the concern of the pilgrims’ families in India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sikh-pilgrims-stranded-in-lahore-on-baisakhi-amid-clashes-in-pakistan-101618302162363.html
13-04-2021||Kolkata||EC asks Dilip Ghosh to clarify stance on Cooch Behar violence||The Election Commission of India has asked Dilip Ghosh, president of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)'s West Bengal unit, to clarify his stance over the killings of four men at Sitalkuchi in the state's Cooch Behar district. Ghosh had earlier courted controversies by saying that more Cooch Behar-like killings may happen in the next phase of the state assembly elections if "naughty boys like the ones who died in Sitalkuchi" try to take the law into their hands. The EC notice on Tuesday cited Dilip Ghosh's remarks and asked the West Bengal BJP president to respond to the notice and make his stand clear on his statements by 10am on Wednesday, ANI reported.Four persons died last Saturday as CISF personnel opened fire after some people "attempted to snatch their rifles" while voting was underway in Cooch Behar's Sitalkuchi assembly constituency area in the fourth phase of the ongoing West Bengal assembly polls. Ghosh, while addressing an election rally at Baranagar in North 24 Parganas district on Sunday, had said, "Naughty boys, who had presumed that the rifles of the central forces were just for a show during election duty, will not dare repeat the same mistake after seeing what happened in Sitalkuchi"."Naughty boys received bullets at Sitalkuchi. If anyone dares to take the law into his hands, this will happen to him also," Ghosh said without elaborating on the phrase 'naughty boys'.The Trinamool Congress had earlier approached the Election Commission against Dilip Ghosh and also demanded his immediate arrest. "We demand his immediate arrest for making such an inflammatory statement which will encourage trigger happy forces and threaten the safety of voters," news agency PTI quoted TMC MP Sukhendu Sekhar Roy as saying. Left Front leader Sujan Chakraborty, among others, had also condemned Ghosh for making the "irresponsible statements" and said that these remarks "unmask the fascist face of the BJP".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/ec-asks-dilip-ghosh-to-clarify-stance-on-cooch-behar-violence-101618298169483.html

She even sent messages to “Prince Charles that his son Prince Harry” is “engaged” to her.“It is well-known fact that fake IDs are created on various social media sites like Facebook, Twitter, etc, and authenticity of such conversation cannot be relied upon by this court. There is every possibility that so-called Prince Harry may be sitting in a cybercafe of a village in Punjab, looking for greener pastures for himself,” the bench said.“(The court) can only show its sympathy for the petitioner that she has believed such fake conversation to be true.”In her habeas corpus plea, Kaur demanded legal action against “Prince Harry Middleton” son of “Prince Charles Middleton resident of United Kingdom”. Further directions were sought to direct the “United Kingdom Police Cell” to take action against him for breaking the alleged promise to marry her. Kaur also sought arrest warrants to avoid any further delay in their marriage.A habeas corpus is filed to have a person, generally, a detainee, produced before a court to determine whether the detention is lawful.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/punjab-haryana-hc-ends-lawyer-s-day-dream-to-marry-prince-harry-101618300420910.html
13-04-2021||Delhi||Drugs cartel busted, 30.5 lakh opioid pills, 70,000 cough syrups, and 15 kilos of amphetamine seized; 4 held||The Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) on Monday said it busted an international drugs cartel and seized 30.5 lakh opioid pills, 70,000 codeine-based cough syrups and nearly 15 kilograms of amphetamine that were manufactured by an authorised pharmaceutical company in Uttarakhand, which allegedly fudged records and supplied them to drug traffickers who further parcelled them out to the UK, the US and European countries.Four persons of the cartel have been arrested from Delhi and Uttar Pradesh in the past 10 days, while the recovery of the contraband were made in 34 seizures by the NCB’s Delhi zone team during the same period.NCB’s deputy director (operations) KPS Malhotra said the members of the cartel used the darknet to receive orders from international clients and they used various other encrypted platforms, including WhatsApp, to communicate with suppliers and carriers for the delivery of drug consignments.“They used encrypted platforms to ensure the anonymity of both the receivers of consignments and the people involved in the logistics. The destinations of the consignments were primarily the US, the UK and Europe. To evade the law and escape detection, the syndicate used to conceal the psychotropic drugs in herbal supplement packages,” Malhotra said.NCB officials said last month, more than two parcels of “herbal supplements”, destined for an address in the UK, were seized from a courier company in west Delhi’s Kirti Nagar following a tipoff that the parcels actually contained psychotropic drugs. The packets were opened and more than two kilos of opioid pills (tramadol) -- the use of opioid pills is strictly curtailed across the world -- were recovered.“We traced the supply chain and found that multiple channels were used to deliver the parcels to the courier company. Our efforts led us to a drug peddler, Kapil Aggarwal in Agra, UP, from whose godown at least a dozen similar parcels, all destined for the same UK address, were seized. We arrested Aggarwal and his interrogation led us to man named A Goyal, also from Agra, and the recovery of more such pills,” said an NCB officer, who asked not to be named.During his interrogation, Goyal disclosed the name of a key player of the syndicate whose job was to receive orders on the darknet and further issue instructions on WhatsApp and other encrypted platforms for procurement, packaging and dispatch of the contraband, the deputy director said. NCB did not reveal the name of the key player, citing ongoing investigations.“Goyal also revealed that the opioid pills were being supplied to them by a pharmaceutical company in Haridwar, Uttarakhand. We searched the factory, found discrepancies in the documentation and seized more tramadol pills, cough syrup and other psychotropic drugs. The owner of the company is currently on the run,” Malhotra said.According to Malhotra, their investigation revealed that the syndicate is a complex one and connected to various other groups involved in the illegal trade using a similar modus operandi. Last year, in a similar operation, the police had arrested a man named Mausam alias Kashmir and the name of one Som Dutt from Delhi had emerged during Mausam’s interrogation.“As Dutt’s name also surfaced during the interrogation of Aggarwal and Goyal, our team collected information about him from Delhi’s Narela. Dutt is one of the prominent shippers of the cartel and he uses India Post for sending consignments to the US and UK, using forged IDs. Dutt’s interrogation led to the arrest of Manish from Balia in Uttar Pradesh,” added the deputy director.He said the arrest of the factory owner and the key player will help the bureau to further unravel the cartel and its dealings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/drugs-cartel-busted-30-5-lakh-opioid-pills-70-000-cough-syrups-and-15-kilos-of-amphetamine-seized-4-held-101618300300365.html

After adding 2,653 Covid-19 beds across private and government hospitals on Monday, Kejriwal said another order is being issued wherein banquet halls and hotels will be attached to the hospitals near them. He also said all government and private hospitals in the city are being analysed so that patients with mild symptoms can be discharged and treated in home isolation.“The aim is to allot hospital beds only for serious Covid-19 patients,” he said. Also Read | Amid strict Covid protocols, temples in Delhi begin Navratri festivity“We have also started another exercise wherein doctors are identifying and releasing Covid-19 patients who can be treated at home. There is nothing to worry about as our teams will regularly monitor them at home through tele-counselling and each patient will get a pulse oximeter so they are able to check their oxygen saturation levels and a timely intervention is made if necessary,” he said.Kejriwal also requested the Central government to cancel the upcoming board examinations or consider some alternative way to conduct them. He suggested the exams could be conducted online or students could be promoted or failed on the basis of their internal assessment marks. “CBSE board exams are approaching. In Delhi, there are 600,000 students who are scheduled to appear for the examinations this year. In addition to that, there are 100,000 teachers who will be involved in conducting these exams. These (the exam centres) could end up being Covid-19 hotspots… Several countries which are witnessing a second wave have also cancelled such examinations. Several state governments in our country also have done the same in their respective state boards,” he said. The chief minister said that with the increase of Covid-19 cases, the demand for plasma has also increased, but currently the city has little stock. He urged those who have recovered from Covid-19 to donate plasma so that others can be treated.Urging those who are 45 years and older to get vaccinated, Kejriwal said those who can avoid going out should remain indoors. “Currently, 65% of the Covid cases in Delhi are of those who are below the age of 45. I know the youth of our city have a lot of responsibilities and they have to work. But, it is for your own safety and that of your family that I urge you to stay indoors. Step out only if it is extremely necessary. Those who have to go out anyway should strictly follow Covid-19 appropriate behaviour. Your safety is in your own hands. Those who are aged 45 years and above must go and get vaccinated,” he said.Kejriwal said that non-Covid emergency services will be available in all hospitals except the 20 private and government hospitals exclusively earmarked for Covid-19 treatment. “There are still several other hospitals other than the... hospitals where people can get emergency treatment for non-Covid ailments. But, we are postponing all planned surgeries and requesting people to do the same. The main focus for us now is to ensure optimum and efficient hospital management. If we are able to manage our health infrastructure well then we will wade through this fourth wave smoothly,” he said.On Monday, Delhi reported 11,491 fresh Covid-19 cases and 72 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/cancel-board-exams-kejriwal-to-centre-as-delhi-sees-13-5k-covid-cases-in-24-hrs-101618299521116.html
13-04-2021||Mumbai||Vaccination age limit of 45 years should be reduced: Maha minister Nawab Malik||Maharashtra minority minister and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader Nawab Malik said on Tuesday the age limit of 45 years for getting vaccinated against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) should be reduced. The Centre on April 1 had started the third phase of its nationwide vaccination drive where doses are being administered to people of age 45 and above.“The age limit should be reduced for states which are most affected by Covid-19 and vaccination should be allowed,” Malik was quoted as saying by news agency ANI. He also demanded vaccinations should be done for all journalists that are operating on the field.Malik’s appeal comes a week after Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray wrote a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on April 5 where he requested Modi to lower the age of vaccinating people to 25 years ‘as the states facing the surge are having to place curbs to safeguard lives of the population.’ Thackeray also said if more young and working population is inoculated, then the intensity of cases will be much lower than the treatment they need at present.45 साल कि उम्र सीमा को कम किया जाए। जो राज्य ज्यादा प्रभावित हैं वहां उम्र सीमा कम करके वैक्सीन लगाने की अनुमति दी जाए। हमने मांग की है कि जो पत्रकार दिनरात मैदान में हैं उन्हें भी यह सुविधा दी जाए। आने वाले दिनों में और कड़े फैसले लिए जा सकते हैं: नवाब मलिक, NCP pic.twitter.com/lSD2cXfezdMaharashtra has so far vaccinated 10,529,376 beneficiaries against the coronavirus disease till now, according to the Union health ministry’s update at 7am. More than 9.52 million of these beneficiaries have received the first dose while 1,008,651 have been given both the doses.Earlier, a war of words broke out between the Maha-Vikas Aghadi led state government and the Centre regarding the shortage of vaccine doses. Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope claimed on April 8 the state was short of doses and demanded 4 million jabs per week from the Centre. He also said that Maharashtra was provided far less doses as compared to Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Haryana.Last week, several vaccination centres in Mumbai, Panvel and Pune district had stopped their inoculation drive due to the shortage reported by the state government.However, Union health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan said on April 8 the Centre was continuously monitoring and enhancing supply of doses. Countering Tope’s allegations, Vardhan tweeted that Maharashtra and Rajasthan had received the highest number of doses across the country.He also slammed the MVA government by saying it was diverting the attention from its failure of managing the pandemic by raising the issue of vaccines. “The inability of the Maharashtra government to act responsibly is beyond comprehension. To spread panic among the people is to compound the folly further. Vaccine supplies are being monitored on a real-time basis, and state governments are being apprised regularly about it. Allegations of vaccine shortage are utterly baseless,” the health minister said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/vaccination-age-limit-of-45-years-should-be-reduced-maha-minister-nawab-malik-101618298374140.html

13-04-2021||Delhi||Navratri Jagratas shifting to daytime during Covid night curfew?||Jagran/jagrata and Mata ki Chowki singers from Delhi are in a fix after most religious congregations have being cancelled or postponed at the last hour due to the new Covid-19 guidelines, announced right before Navratri. Most say that they have had to incur huge financial losses, and some share that in a few cases jagrans have been shifted to the day time due to night curfew! ‘Kaam zero hai, ‘Jaagran nahin ho rahe hai’, are some of the responses of jagran singers, who are part of bhajan mandlis across Delhi-NCR, since the news of night curfew and capping on religious gatherings to a minimum of 50, has come in. A Delhi-based jagrata singer Jyoti Prakash Sharma, who has been singing bhajans for over 20 years, says his scheduled programme has been shifted to the day time. “I mostly perform at atleast four to five programmes at a gap of a day or two, during the entire period of Navratri. This time, after the news of night curfew and new guidelines came in, around three programmes got cancelled. But one of the places, where I had to sing, has been shifted to a day time of 3.30pm. The organisers have discussed to wrap by max by 7pm so that both the musicians and devotees can reach home within time. Ma ka parchar kar rahe hain hum toh; raat ki jagah din me kar lenge to bhi Ma khush hongi hi!” But this scheme of things isn’t as easy to adjust, say some, since many singers or instrumentalists with the bhajan groups have other jobs or businesses to attend during the day time. “Log pareshan hai (People are hassled),” says Vinod Arora from Maa Bhagwati Sewa Mandal, which has a team of eleven members. Talking about the current scenario, he adds: “Lagta hai virtually karna padega. Jo orchestra rent pe dete hain unka toh kamai ka time hota tha yeh. We’ll either planning to do virtually or shift it to the day time, between 2pm to 5pm. A lot of enquiries are coming in to check if we will perform in the day time, because those who had booked us for chowki in the evenings of Navratri, have already called up to cancel their plan. But the concen is that those of us who are working elsewhere during the day can’t shut shop at 6pm to perform at such events during the day time. Even the devotees who are working will find it difficult to attend a day time Mata ki Chowki.”Anita Khanna, from Rakesh Khanna and Party based in Mayur Vihar, rues how she had to incur losses all of last year, but now after things started coming back to normal, she feels back to square one. “Bahut programmes cancel ho gaya hain. Chowki ho rahin hain par 6pm to 9pm, and mostly din ke programme bhi 6pm tak khatm hote hain to uske baad ek aur program fatafat karna humesha possible nahi ho pata,” says Khanna, and Vipin Bhalla, a singer from a jagran party based in Geeta Colony, adds that most of his programmes have been postponed to a later date. “Night curfew se saara kaam band ho gaya. Everyone is at home... Humara kaam sab jagran aur chowki jaise dharmik program par hi nirbhar hai. Kaam hi nahin hoga toh.... Jagrans are not possible online. What one experiences live is completely different. It’s been a year fighting this disease, don’t know how will we survive further.” Author tweets @Nainaarora8Follow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/navratri-jagratas-shifting-to-daytime-during-covid-night-curfew-101618296942384.html

Morning aarti was performed at popular Jhandewalan Devi Mandir by the priest in the presence of temple authorities but it was not open for the public.Navratri is a popular Hindu festival where devotees pray to goddess Durga for nine days. “The aarti and puja were performed today morning and the same will be done in the evening as well. However, the temple will remain closed for devotees due to the sudden surge in coronavirus cases. Devotees’ safety is paramount for us,” a functionary at the temple said, requesting anonymity.Meanwhile, devotees offered prayers at Kalkaji Temple amid strict Covid-19 protocols. To regulate crowd and ensure that social distancing norms are followed, the temple management has introduced a system of e-pass for visitors. “Devotees can get it issued from the temple website where they will be given a time slot for visit on a particular day. This will discourage crowding. There is no entry in temple without masks,” a temple management functionary said.Other than this, the popular Chattarpur Temple will remain closed for devotees for nine days. The Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) has issued guidelines that there should be no religious gatherings such as jagrans (prayer meetings) and community feasts (bhandara) anywhere in the city.Delhi Police officers said police personnel will be deployed at popular temples and mosques to ensure due compliance of Covid guidelines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/amid-strict-covid-protocols-temples-in-delhi-begin-navratri-festivity-101618296460902.html
13-04-2021||Delhi||Baisakhi 2021: Celebrating the spirit of the festival with fitness!||If you spot men and women running on the streets of Gurugram while sporting turbans and traditional wear, do pause and wish them Happy Baisakhi! “While Baisakhi is celebrated with great gusto in Punjab, members of the community in other places might miss the enthusiasm in their own cities. This made us start The Great Run of Punjab (TGRP), an annual Baisakhi running or walking challenge, to connect people in various parts of the world,” says Mehak Kapoor, a Gurugrammer who along with Balwinder Singh, from Gurgaon Runners Group, organised the fourth edition of the virtual running challenge, ahead of Baisakhi. This year, TGRP challenge started on April 1 and culminate on April 13. It has over 250 participants joining virtually from not just Amritsar and Delhi-NCR, but even Goa! Deepak Chhillar, a Delhiite who works as a business manager in a pharmaceutical company, has been running the challenge each year, often with podium finishes, and says, “This is an innovative way of celebrating the festival, but at one point I really wanted to give up because it’s not easy to get up and run 25 km and then head back to work... I realised how running helps me become strong headed because you don’t just need physical exercise but also mental strength for it!” “The challenge has two categories — regular runners who can run 13km per day and beginners who can opt for 1km on day one, 2km on day two, and keep increasing the distance by a kilometre every day, to slowly incorporate running as an activity in their lives,” informs Kapoor, adding, “TGRP has grown to become a loved festival activity that allows every participating member to ring in the festival while promoting a healthy lifestyle. And the pandemic only highlighted the need to have a proper fitness regime, which is what we aim to further through this run.”A Gurugrammer, Aparna Paul Shet, who formed a women’s cricket team in her condo, has inspired seven other residents to participate in this challenge. “Since due to the Covid situation we can’t have communal Baisakhi celebrations, participating in TGRP is a perfect way to celebrate the harvest festival. While I run 20km per day, I asked members of the cricket team here to participate in the event as well, so that they feel fitter. And we are taking all safety measures while running as we run only in open lawns, wear masks when we are together, and sanitise all the surfaces where we sit.”  Author tweets @bhagat_mallikaFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/baisakhi-2021-celebrating-the-spirit-of-the-festival-with-fitness-101618294852592.html

However, Sidhu did not visit the families of the firing victims protesting barely 20 km away from the gurdwara against the delay in getting justice. Sidhu was prompt to upload photos of his brief visit on social media and announced a Facebook live interaction. After the Punjab and Haryana high court last week quashed probe reports submitted by Punjab Police’s special investigation team (SIT) in connection with the 2015 Kotkapura firing, the families of Gurjeet Singh and Krishan Bhagwan Singh, who were killed in the police firing in Faridkot district’s Behbal Kalan on October 14, 2015, announced the protest at Kotkapura Chowk on Tuesday against the delay in getting justice. All parties have failed to get us justice: Victim’s kin Sukhraj Singh, the son of Krishan Bhagwan Singh, said they got to know about Sidhu’s visit to the gurdwara at Burj Jawahar Singh Wala and his return to Moga only this morning. “No one contacted us. I don’t know why he chose to visit the gurdwara today and not support our cause. All political parties and religious outfits have failed to get us justice,” he said. The bir of Guru Granth Sahib was stolen from the gurdwara at Burj Jawahar Singh Wala village on June 1, 2015. A case was registered at Bajakhana police station. Later, the sacrilege of Guru Granth Sahib was committed as torn pages of the bir were found scattered in front of a gurdwara at Bargari on October 12, 2015, triggering outrage across the state. Gurjeet Singh of Sarawan village and Krishan Bhagwan Singh of Niamiwala village had died in the police firing on October 14, 2015, while protesting against the desecration of Guru Granth Sahib. Besides, many people were seriously injured. They joined the villagers in their demonstration at Behbal Kalan bus stand against the sacrilege incident at Bargari. Earlier that day, the police had opened fire on protesters at Kotkapura Chowk, injuring several persons.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/on-baisakhi-sidhu-visits-epicentre-of-2015-sacrilege-incidents-in-punjab-101618294600714.html

Efforts are going on to expand facilities,” he added.“Two battery operated tricycles, assisted by a home guard jawan, were provided to ferry senior citizens and differently abled passengers to cover the distance from entrance gate to civil enclave ,” the APD said.Bihar water resources and IPRD minister Sanjay Kumar Jha tweeted on Monday, “ It has been a great start. The figures for the first five months (November 8- April 7) of traffic are testimony to this fact. It is a matter of pride for us”.The minister concerned provided data of number of flights and passengers.The figure revealed that in the first five months, despite frequent flight cancellations during winter season, Darbhanga airport catered to as many as 165,990 passengers and operated 1030 flightsHowever, since becoming operational on November 8 last year, as many as 173,811 passengers have travelled to and from Darbhanga airport till April 11, revealed an informed source.Former MP attacks Nitish Kumar over developement of airportFormer Darbhanga MP Kirti Azad launched a scathing attack on chief minister Nitish Kumar for delay in land acquisition for expansion of the airport.In a press statement issued on Sunday, Azad said the CM and one Yuvraj (whose identity was not specified by the ex-MP in his statement) were throwing dust in the eyes of people of Mithila by doing table politics just to give credit to each other.The matter concerning land acquisition was so far on paper only, he added.“Chief Minister was never interested in the development of Darbhanga Airport. Just like no initiative has been started for the development of Purnia Airport till date,” Azad said.In the meantime, incumbent MP from Darbhanga Gopal Jee Thakur said that he raked up demand to start civil aviation facility long ago. “I had raked up the issue of starting flight service from Darbhanga airport in state assembly as an MLA from Benipur assembly constituency,” he said.Thakur said he also met the then union minister of state for civil aviation Jayant Sinha to discuss expansion and development of airport under UDAN. “An area of 78 acres will be required to construct permanent civil enclave and set up navigational facilities,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/passengers-at-bihar-s-darbhanga-airport-struggle-without-transport-at-entry-gate-101618290171553.html

The ECI banned her from 8pm on Monday till 8pm on April 13 for her “highly insinuating and provocative remarks” which, the poll body said, could affect the election process.Click here for full election coverageOn April 7 and April 8, the ECI sent notices to the Trinamool chief for allegedly urging Muslims to guard against those splitting their votes and for asking people to “gherao” (block) central paramilitary security forces respectively. Commenting on her reply to these notices, the poll body said Mamata Banerjee has “selectively chosen parts of her speech in her reply” and that “her reply has yet again conveniently left out key parts of her speech, perhaps due to selective amnesia.”In its Monday notice barring the leader from campaigning, the EC condemned her statements and advised her "to desist from using such statements while making public utterances during the period when Model Code of Conduct is in force."To protest against the undemocratic and unconstitutional decision of the Election Commission of India, I will sit on dharna tomorrow at Gandhi Murti, Kolkata from 12 noon."Whereas, the Commission has carefully considered the matter and is of the considered view that Ms. Mamata Banerjee, who also happens to be the Chief Minister of the State, has in violation of the provisions of Model Code of Conduct as well as Section 123(3) & (3A) of the Representation of the People Act, 1951 and Sections 186, 189 and 505 of Indian Penal Code, 1860 made highly insinuating and provocative remarks laden with serious potential of breakdown of law & order and thereby adversely affecting the election process,” the commission said in its order.Also Read: EC bans Mamata Banerjee from campaigning for 24 hours, she says will protestReacting to the latest ECI notice to her, the TMC leader condemned the poll body for its 'unconstitutional' and 'undemocratic' decision.“To protest against the undemocratic and unconstitutional decision of the Election Commission of India, I will sit on dharna tomorrow at Gandhi Murti, Kolkata from 12 noon,” she tweeted.West Bengal assembly elections are being held in eight phases out of which four have been conducted.

According to officials familiar with the matter, the state government is expected to make an announcement about the lockdown on April 14, after a cabinet meeting, and begin its implementation from the evening of April 15.The state recorded 51,751 new cases on Monday, taking its overall tally of cases to 3,458,996; 258 people died from Covid-19.Read more: Amid rise in Covid-19 cases, Maharashtra postpones state board examsState public health minister Rajesh Tope said the lockdown is inevitable, but the state government was tapping the ways to reduce its impact. “We held a couple of meetings with various departments on Monday...

13-04-2021||Delhi||DDA plans to mark boundaries of Yamuna plains, experts raise alarm||The Delhi Development Authority (DDA) is preparing a proposal to demarcate the boundaries of Zone O -- the land planning zone which encompasses the Yamuna floodplains -- to provide ownership rights to 76 unauthorised colonies that have come up along the river, senior officials aware of the matter said.The officials said the proposal will be submitted to the principal committee of the National Green Tribunal (NGT). Experts, however, warned that any change in the boundaries of the already encroached-upon floodplain will spell doom for the Yamuna.The Parliament passed the National Capital Territory of Delhi (Recognition of Property Rights of Residents in Unauthorised Colonies) Bill in December 2019 to provide ownership rights to over 40 lakh people living in 1,797 unauthorised colonies across the capital.DDA had to suspend the process of survey and assessment in these 76 colonies including Jaitpur, Badarpur, Okhla, Karawal Nagar since they fall under Zone O. As per the MPD-2021 norms, no construction is allowed in Zone O that is spread over 8,070 hectares along the Yamuna in Delhi.Floodplains play an important role in maintaining the flow of the river, helping recharge ground water and providing a habitat for aquatic biodiversity. They are integral to river hydrology. A senior DDA official said in the latest proposal, the agency was marking all the different kinds of developments that have come up in Zone O.A second official speaking on the condition of anonymity said, “The floodplain has to be protected...but these unauthorised colonies are located outside the floodplain.” The official added that taking these colonies out of the Zone O will help provide better infrastructure and environment-friendly development.Residents of Jaitpur, Badarpur, Okhla, Karawal Nagar, etc have been demanding that their colonies should be denotified from Zone O.Anil Sharma, a resident of Meethapur in south east Delhi, has formed an association to push the demand for removal of the colony’s name from the restricted zone. He said the colony was situated more than 1.5km away from the floodplain.“This was agricultural land, but we are still placed in ‘O’ zone. Due to this, several development projects are stuck. We can’t even reconstruct our houses,” said Sharma.After the Centre announced the PM-UDAY scheme, several residents of these colonies applied for ownership rights. Mahesh Yadav, 52, who has a house in Ekta Vihar in the Badarpur assembly constituency, said his application was rejected last year and DDA suspended the scheme in his colony. “I had all the paperwork in place, but my application was rejected as the colony falls in Zone O... It is a huge disappointment,” said Yadav, who has been living here for the past 28 years and works with an insurance firm.BJP MLA Ramvir Singh Bidhuri, who is the leader of Opposition in the Delhi assembly, said the process to define O-zone was incorrect. “It includes areas which are over a kilometre away from the river. There are resettlement colonies, which were given land by the DDA, and several villages that have been in existence for years... These should be removed from the zone so that development can happen. The Centre has come out with PM-UDAY, but lakhs of residents can’t benefit from the scheme,” said Bidhuri.But environmentalists disagreed. Manoj Misra, convener of Yamuna Jiye Abhiyaan, said, “The move will play havoc with the integrity of the river in the city and set a wrong and dangerous precedent... By delineating the boundaries of Zone O, efforts are being made to legalise all illegal constructions. I have written to Delhi L-G and DDA that this shouldn’t be done.”Referring to the concerns of residents in 76 unauthorised colonies, Misra said, “The NGT judgment of January 2015 already provides for such exigencies suggesting that these areas be treated as a ‘special area within Zone O’ so that activities like laying of sewer lines, etc could be carried out there without requiring any change in the existing boundaries of the zone.”Shashank Shekhar, professor at DU’s department of geology, said these colonies have come up illegally and delineating the zone ‘O’ will set a wrong precedent. “The aim should be to protect the floodplain. Before going to NGT with its proposal, DDA should get a study done by experts to explore and suggest possible environmentally sustainable options to the problem.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/dda-plans-to-mark-boundaries-of-yamuna-plains-experts-raise-alarm-101618257124036.html
13-04-2021||Delhi||6th sero survey kicks off in Delhi amid Covid-19 case surge||As the fourth wave of Covid-19 rages in the Capital, authorities in Delhi on Monday started collecting samples for the city’s sixth serological survey to determine the population-level prevalence of antibodies against the Sar-CoV-2 virus. Officials said sample collection will end in around 10 days.The last such survey, samples for which were collected between January 11 and 21, found that over 56% of Delhi residents were exposed to the virus.District and health department officials said field workers and auxiliary nurse midwifes, who were already working overtime, have now started collecting samples for the sero survey.Read more: Delhi Covid-19 testing labs at capacity, home collections hit“It will take around 10 days to complete the drive, especially now that the Covid-19 cases are going up and workers are busy with contact tracing and containment work. Usually, we request nurses, doctors, and teachers from civic body and government hospitals to conduct the survey,” said a senior district official.The prevalence of antibodies more than doubled from 25.5% during the October round of survey, largely owing to the third wave of cases in November, when 8,593 cases were reported in a single day at the peak.The ongoing fourth wave of the infection has eclipsed previous records, with 11,491 new cases reported on Monday.For the sixth round of the sero survey, 28,000 samples will be collected from the 272 municipal wards in Delhi, officials said.“The study is designed to gauge the prevalence of antibodies; I cannot comment on the quality of the antibodies. We are expecting to see an increase in the level of antibodies in the current survey. However, it will not capture the current increase in cases as it takes some time to develop the antibodies,” said Dr Pragya Sharma, professor of community medicine, Maulana Azad Medical College, who is a part of the study.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/6th-sero-survey-kicks-off-in-delhi-amid-case-surge-101618256629338.html
13-04-2021||Delhi||Doctor arrested for forging wife’s signature to get loans||The Delhi Police’s economic offences wing (EOW) on Monday said it arrested a 58-year-old doctor for allegedly forging his wife’s signature and ID cards to mortgage their joint property and avail two loans worth ₹2.90 crore without her knowledge.The couple, both doctors, have been living separately since 2006. The accused, Sudhakar Arya, who runs a nursing home in Vaishali near Ghaziabad, was arrested last week and is presently in jail, said additional deputy commissioner of police (EOW) K Ramesh. “A case of cheating and forgery was registered in 2018 on the complaint of Arya’s wife. During the investigation, we verified the allegations and sent the relevant documents and signatures to the forensic lab for authentication. After collecting enough evidence against Arya, we arrested him. The probe is still on,” he said.Additional commissioner of police (EOW) R K Singh said the fraud came to light when an application by Arya’s wife for a loan in a nationalised bank for her daughter’s higher studies was rejected. The bank told her that she had already taken heavy loans and had defaulted on payments too. Upon further enquiry, she learnt that her husband had allegedly taken two loans of nearly ₹2.90 crore from a finance company in 2015-16.“The woman found that her signatures were forged on the loan forms and the attached PAN and voter ID cards were also fake. Her husband had mortgaged their joint properties as a collateral security, without her knowledge or consent,” said Singh, adding that a case was registered on the woman’s complaint and investigation was taken up.During the probe, the additional DCP said, it was learnt that the non-banking financial institution had moved for the auction of the property due to non-payment of dues. The two mortgaged properties are in Vaishali and east Delhi’s Patparganj.“Our probe revealed that the couple had a joint account in which the two loan amounts were transferred. Arya withdrew the money and used a portion of it to repay the loans he had earlier taken in his own name. Where he invested the remaining money is being probed,” added Ramesh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/doctor-arrested-for-forging-wife-s-signature-to-get-loans-101618257291871.html
13-04-2021||Delhi||Denied money to buy alcohol, 29-yr-old stabs father to death||Angry at not being given money for buying alcohol, a drunk man allegedly killed his 61-year-old father by repeatedly stabbing him at their home in south Delhi’s Fatehpur Beri on Sunday night.The accused, 29-year-old Balwan Singh, allegedly tried to escape from the crime spot, but was too drunk to venture far away, said police. “We arrested Balwan alias Vicky soon after receiving a call about the attack,” said Atul Kumar Thakur, deputy commissioner of police (south).Balwan lived with his wife, three children and his father, Manohar Singh. His mother passed away six years ago.Manohar retired as a sanitation worker with the municipal corporation and had a monthly pension. His son, who worked as a mason and did odd jobs, would often drink for several days and not go to work, the DCP said.“Every other day, Balwan would ask his father to give him a part of his pension money, mostly to use it for drinking. But his father wouldn’t part with his money. That would lead to frequent quarrels between the father and son,” Thakur said.But the calming presence of Balwan’s wife in the house usually meant the quarrels didn’t lead to violence, police said.On Sunday, however, Balwan’s wife and three children had gone to a relative’s house.Balwan, who was drinking, approached his father after he fell short of money on Sunday night. “When his father refused, he repeatedly attacked him with a knife. He then threw the knife somewhere and left the spot,” the DCP said.Neighbours rushed the injured man to the AIIMS trauma centre where he succumbed to the stab wounds.After visiting the crime scene on Sunday night, police arrested Balwan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/denied-money-to-buy-alcohol-29-yr-old-stabs-father-to-death-101618257250543.html
13-04-2021||Delhi||Delhi Covid-19 testing labs at capacity, home collections hit||Covid-19 testing labs in the national capital are swamped with samples, forcing many to reject requests for home collection and return results after delays stretching to days, a problem that could jeopardise efforts to contain the outbreak as infected people remain unaware of their need to isolate and their contacts are unreached.The Capital conducted over 100,000 tests thrice in the last seven days. In the first week of March, it was at an average of around 63,500 a day.Officials said the delays are hitting the government’s containment and contact tracing measures. “Earlier, we used to get all the test reports within the day; now it takes at least 48 hours or even more. It is across government and private sector labs, we send our samples to both, because they are flooded with a lot of samples,” said a senior district official, asking not to be named.The official added, “This does impact the containment measures. We can only create the containment areas once we get the report. We also ask all contacts to remain in quarantine till their test results come back, but without the test report many do not take it seriously.”Read more: Low-key celebrations to mark festivals, albeit with precautionsThe Delhi health minister had said that 20 to 30 contacts were being traced and tested for each positive case when the current surge began.One of the bottlenecks, the official said, was with a particular lab SpiceHealth, which promised results within hours. The official website of the laboratory on Monday had a message stating: “Due to sudden spike in Covid-19 cases in India, we have been inundated with RT-PCR samples to test. Providing an accurate test report is paramount to us. So, while we are trying our best to share your reports soon, expect them to be shared within 48 hours.”The Delhi high court in October last year asked the government to ensure that Covid-19 reports are made available within 24 hours.Typically, RT-PCR tests take at least 4-5 hours after a sample is collected. The process involves data entry, which need to conform to a format laid down by the Indian Council of Medical Research, before batches are processed in the RT-PCR devices. The last leg of the process, analysis of the report, too adds to the turnaround time.The Union government has advised states to carry out at least 70% of the tests using this method since it is more accurate than the rapid antigen tests.A senior official from Delhi’s health department said the laboratories were working at “optimum level”. “We are now using all our labs to an optimum level. In addition, we are also using the capacity of some laboratories in the NCR region. The government has also directed laboratories to increase their testing capacity,” this person said.Read more: 14 private, 6 state govt hospitals dedicated for 100% Covid-19 treatmentThe owner of one of the laboratories approved to conduct RT PCR tests in Delhi-NCR said on the condition of anonymity that it was difficult to increase capacity. “How can we increase capacity? All governments have capped prices for tests; the prices are so low we can barely make ends meet. Where will we find the investment to set up new machines? A new RT-PCR machine along with an RNA extractor costs ₹50 lakhs. And, this does not factor in the money needed for the physical infrastructure for housing the machine, the manpower needed to run it,” said this person.Another private laboratory owner, who too asked not to be named, said: “The number of samples that we are getting has shot up – from 1,500 to 2,000 a day in one of my labs to nearly 8,000. All my employees are overworked, they are doing double shifts in order to process the samples.”Experts said several issues may come up due to this crunch in testing capacity.“The number of tests is going up, but no one is talking about quality. Do we have so many good quality kits available, enough trained manpower to collect samples, run the test, and analyze the report? Instead of numbers, we need to focus on reliable, valid tests,” said Dr Jugal Kishore, head of the department of community medicine at Safdarjung hospital.“In addition, we should do targeted testing of those who are symptomatic instead of testing every one. We needed to target the contacts, and follow the test, trace and treat when the number of cases were low. Now, the infection has already spread everywhere,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-covid-19-testing-labs-at-capacity-home-collections-hit-101618256546274.html
13-04-2021||Mumbai||CBI to question Deshmukh over ex-top cop’s allegations||The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has asked former Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh to appear before it on Wednesday in connection with its preliminary enquiry (PE) against him into allegations that he asked suspended police officer Sachin Vaze to extort ₹100 crore a month in Mumbai from bars, restaurants, hotels, and other sources, two officials said on Monday.Former Mumbai Police chief Param Bir Singh, in a letter to Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray last month, levelled these allegations against Deshmukh in the aftermath of an explosives-laden vehicle being found near industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s house, the murder of a man linked to the vehicle, the arrest of Vaze, and the removal of Singh as Mumbai’s police commissioner.“Anil Deshmukh is the primary suspect in this enquiry. He needs to be questioned regarding the claims that he wanted Vaze to collect this scale of money every month. He will be confronted with the statements of Vaze, Param Bir Singh and his staff,” said one of the officers who asked not to be named.The Bombay high court ordered a CBI probe against Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader Deshmukh on April 5, saying a police investigation was not possible as the department reported to him. He resigned as home minister the same day.Read more: After crime branch, Mumbai Police's EOW officials to face 'clean up'On April 8, terming the allegations as “serious”, the Supreme Court dismissed pleas by the NCP leader and the Maharashtra government challenging the high court order.On Sunday, CBI questioned Deshmukh’s personal assistants, Sanjeev Palande and Kundan Shinde. Vaze and Param Bir Singh were examined last week.CBI took their statements to find out if Deshmukh indeed asked Vaze and assistant commissioner of police Sanjay Patil to collect ₹100 crore from hotels, bars, restaurants, and other sources, as alleged by Singh in his eight-page letter to Thackeray on March 20. Singh also said in his letter that when Vaze and Patil went to meet Deshmukh at the latter’s residence, Palande and Shinde were present there.People familiar with the CBI’s PE procedure told HT that though they have just nine more days to conclude the inquiry, finding a “prime facie” offence would not be difficult.Several documents recovered by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) during the probe into the bomb scare near Ambani’s house Antilia, and the murder of businessman Mansukh Hiran, who was linked to the vehicle in which the gelatin sticks were found, have been analysed by CBI over last few days. The federal agency has also questioned bar owners, Mumbai Police officers, and people close to Deshmukh.Read more: 11-min call led ATS to accused in Hiran caseNCP leader Dilip Walse Patil has assumed charge as the home minister of Maharashtra after Deshmukh’s resignation. The state government has also set up a probe by retired Bombay high court judge Kailash Chandiwal to probe the allegations against Deshmukh, and submit a report within six months.NCP said that Deshmukh will cooperate with the agency in the inquiry. “If CBI has summoned him then he (Anil Deshmukh) will respond and cooperate accordingly. He made no mistake and we are sure he will come out clean in the CBI inquiry,” said Nawab Malik, the party’s chief spokesperson and state minority affairs minister.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/cbi-to-question-deshmukh-over-ex-top-cop-s-allegations-101618252025423.html

Many guests at the event were seen openly flouting the distancing and mask norms as police and administration officials remained mute spectators. Sandhu claimed that no invites had been sent out and that the residents had turned up on their own. This even as the party’s supporters had installed huge hoardings across the town, to announce the event. “We had planned for a gathering of only around 100 people so that distancing can be maintained. Residents themselves thronged to the site,” said Sandhu. Cabinet minister Brahm Mohindra, who laid the foundation stone of the bus terminal project, echoed Sandhu’s views. “People thronged the site themselves. We could not stop them. However, we ensured that Covid-19 guidelines are followed.”Interestingly, no police action has been taken against the violators. Mullanpur-Dakha station house officer Prem Singh said, “Police inspected the spot. Social distancing norms were being followed. Residents from Mullanpur town and nearby villages had gathered at the spot uninvited as is the case at most political events. Police have received no complaint in this case.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/cong-supporters-violate-distancing-norms-at-mullanpur-dakha-event-101618258119067.html

The incident took place around 10pm when the victim was going to Jalandhar from Rajasthan.Garish Kapoor, 39, of Jalandhar, told the cops that the unidentified men intercepted him and threatened him at gunpoint before fleeing with his car. The police said that they have recovered the car and registered an FIR against unidentified persons under Section 379 (snatching) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and sections 25/54 and 59 of the Arms Act.Investigating officer ASI Gurnaib Singh said after snatching the car, the accused left it on the road and left in their own car.“It appears that when the accused came to know that the victim’s car had a GPS system installed, they left the vehicle on the roadside. The accused are at large and efforts are on to nab them,” the ASI said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/snatched-at-gunpoint-in-moga-car-found-abandoned-3km-away-101618257460857.html
13-04-2021||Other||Mullanpur-Dakha town to finally get a bus stand||In a relief for residents of Mullanpur-Dakha, Punjab local bodies minister Brahm Mohindra on Monday laid the foundation stone for a bus terminal in the town. It will be set up on 7, 000 sq yards at a cost of ₹8.81 crore. The residents of the town, which has a population of around 20,000, have been demanding the setting up of a bus stand here for the past several decades.In the absence of a dedicated bus stand, residents, including women and schoolchildren, had no option but to go all the way up to the main Mullanpur Chowk or the Ludhiana-Moga highway to catch a bus.Sarabjit Kaur, who was waiting at the Mullanpur Chowk to board a bus to Jagraon, said, “We have to come all the way up to the main chowk or the highway to catch a bus. Sometimes, even after waiting for hours, we aren’t able to catch a bus as the bus operators sometimes don’t even stop at this chowk.” She added that since there is no shed here, people have to stand in the scorching heat while waiting for a bus. “We sometimes take refuge in nearby shops but it is still tiring to stand for hours on. Once a bus stand is set up, we will at least have a seating facility,” she said. Rajinder Singh, a resident of Mullanpur town, said, “We had been demanding a bus stand for decades. We hope the work is completed quickly.” Political advisor to the CM and in-charge of Dakha constituency, Captain Sandeep Sandhu said the bus terminal project will be completed in six months. He added that the office of the municipal council will be shifted to the first floor of the three-storeyed bus stand building. Besides, parking, shops, and canteens will also come up here.

13-04-2021||Chandigarh||Rift in Congress over Bhikhiwind nagar panchayat chief’s seat||Fissures have emerged in the ruling Congress over the election of Bhikhiwind nagar panchayat’s president with two party councillors threatening to approach Punjab and Haryana high court over the ‘unfair’ election of the committee’s chief.On Saturday, councillor from ward number 4, Rajinder Kumar alias Babbu Sharma, was elected as the committee’s president in presence of Khemkaran MLA Sukhpal Singh Bhullar and Bhikhiwind subdivisional magistrate (SDM) Rajesh Sharma.Out of the total 13 wards of the nagar panchayat, the Congress won 11 seats while the victory on two other wards was established by the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) candidates. The election was held in February. Two of the 11 Congress councillors — Sukhpal Singh alias Gabria and Sakattar Singh Daliri — and two SAD councillors had boycotted the election of the committee’s chief. Both the rebellious Congress councillors have alleged that the MLA had “killed the democracy” by forcing the other councillors to vote for Babbu Sharma. The duo has also claimed that the MLA had promised to give them higher representations in the committee.“I have been working in the Congress for the last 20 years. I live in ward number 12 while MLA Bhullar had asked me to contest the election from ward number 3 where SAD’s senior leader Virsa Singh Thekedar was my contender. I won the election with a margin of more than 100 votes. No one from the Congress was willing to fight against Thekedar. Before the election, the MLA had promised me the committee’s president post,” Gabria said.“On Saturday, the majority was in the favour of me and Daliri as we had gathered seven councillors. But the MLA mounted pressure on other councillors, mostly women, to elect Babbu Sharma. Following this, I and Daliri had boycotted the election. Many of the councillors wanted either me or Daliri to be the president. The MLA has taken bribes from Babbu. We have also informed the party high command about the MLA’s excesses. Now, we are planning to approach the Punjab and Haryana high court to cancel the unfair election of the president. When we will file our petition, seven to eight councillors will be with us,” he claimed. “I supported Sukhpal Bhullar during his MLA’s election. He promised to elect me as the committee’s chief in public gatherings. However, on Saturday, the MLA betrayed me,” said Daliri, former president of the Bhikhiwind arhtiya association. Daliri had won the election from ward number 12.He alleged, “Babbu is an incompetent person and he had lost the election from ward number 4. However, the MLA had rigged the poll results to make him win. Even fake votes were casted to ensure Babbu’s victory.”The MLA, however, said, “Both the councillors are lying. Their action is just for their personal gain. The election of the president was held in free and fair manner and majority of the councillors had voted for Babbu Sharma. The duo should follow the party’s ethics and respect the people’s mandate.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/rift-in-congress-over-bhikhiwind-nagar-panchayat-chief-s-seat-101618257458766.html
13-04-2021||Chandigarh||Patiala police record statement of gangster-turned-activist Lakha Sidhana’s cousin||A team of Patiala police on Monday recorded the statement of Gurdeep Singh, who was allegedly abducted last week by ‘unidentified persons’.Gurdeep is a cousin of gangster-turned-activist Lakha Sidhana, who is wanted in the January-26 Red Fort violence case.Led by ASI Ajaib Singh, the Patiala police met Gurdeep at local civil hospital’s emergency ward in the evening. The visiting official said a complaint of abduction, torture, and intimidation was received against ‘unknown persons’.“Further investigation and legal action will be initiated after registering an FIR at the Urban Estate police station,” he added.On Sunday, an official message was sent to the Patiala police administration that a 24-year-old patient, who is undergoing treatment at Bathinda civil hospital, has alleged that he was taken into illegal custody of Delhi Police’s special cell near Punjabi University on April 8.Gurdeep, a law student, went to Patiala from Bathinda’s Sidhana village on April 8 to take an exam through online mode, it was claimed. He was stated to be accompanied by Gurpreet Singh, a patwari with state irrigation department, and both were picked by the Delhi cops. In a statement, the Delhi Police on Monday confirmed that a special cell team picked Gurdeep to know the presence and movements of Sidhana, who is wanted for a crime in the national capital.“Gurdeep was relieved with a direction to appear and join the investigation as and when required. The allegation pertaining to illegal detention and physical assault are strongly denied as being false, baseless and an afterthought to put pressure on the investigating teams,” the Delhi Police reportedly said.Meanwhile, officials at the civil hospital said in view of Gurdeep’s chronic ailment of ulcer, he has been advised to shift to Guru Gobind Singh Medical College for better care during the ongoing pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/patiala-police-record-statement-of-gangster-turned-activist-lakha-sidhana-s-cousin-101618257398757.html
13-04-2021||Chandigarh||Lakha Sidhana’s cousin Gurdeeep was quizzed, not detained: Delhi Police||The Delhi police on Monday refuted allegations that they had “illegally” detained gangster-turned-activist Lakha Sidhana’s cousin Gurdeep Singh in Punjab, even as a team of its special cell questioned him. Sidhana is wanted by the Delhi police in connection with the Republic Day violence in the national capital, when thousands of protesting farmers, who reached ITO from the Ghazipur border, clashed with the police. Many of the protesters, driving tractors, reached the Red Fort and entered the monument, where a religious flag was also hoisted. Over 500 police personnel were injured in the violence. In a statement, the police said it is learnt that allegations and misinformation are being propagated on the social media regarding the detention of one Gurdeep Singh alias Mundi by a Delhi police team in Punjab. Several cases were registered by the Delhi police in connection with the Republic Day violence in the national capital, a large number of suspects have been examined and about 160 accused belonging to Delhi and several other states arrested. Sidhana is wanted in some of these cases and is deliberately evading arrest, the statement said. According to the police, on April 8, a special cell team that was moving in the vicinity of Patiala in search of Sidhana, questioned Gurdeep Singh. He was asked about the presence and movements of Sidhana and thereafter, he was relieved with a direction to appear and join investigation as and when required. “The investigation is being conducted as per law and in accordance with the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure. It is relevant to note that no allegation of assault or mistreatment has been made by any of the 160 accused persons arrested by the Delhi police in these cases so far,” the statement said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/lakha-sidhana-s-cousin-gurdeeep-was-quizzed-not-detained-delhi-police-101618257281416.html

It is for the second consecutive day that the city has seen over 500 cases in a day.Despite imposition of night curfew, closing of educational institutions and ban on large public gatherings, Covid cases in Ludhiana are continuing on the upward surge. Compared to 7, 294 cases and 115 deaths in March, the district has recorded 5, 084 cases and 68 deaths in just 12 days of April, including five casualties on Monday that took the toll to 1, 212.Over the last 17 days, the district has recorded 400-plus cases on eight days, including 497 on March 27, trumping the first wave’s highest surge of 464 cases on September 17, 2020.Ludhiana’s case tally now stands at 39, 494, of which 3, 381 patients are under treatment, while 34,901 have recuperated – taking the recovery rate of 88%, against the national average of 90.44%.Those who died on Monday include a 72-year-old male from Ghumar Mandi, a 52-year-old female from Alamgir village, a 59-year-old female from Daba Road, a 65-year-old male from Lohara Road and a 69-year-old female from Khanna.Among those positive are three healthcare workers, a policeman, an undertrial, two international travelers and two teachers from Government Senior Secondary School, Cemetery Road, and a teacher from Sacred Heart School, Sarabha Nagar.10, 192 people inoculated As many as 10, 192 people turned up at various government and private health centres for Covid vaccination on Monday.

13-04-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Laboratories swamped with samples for Covid tests for patients, travellers||The surge in Covid-19 cases brought about by the second wave of the coronavirus pandemic and state guidelines mandating negative RT-PCR tests for those working in public transportation, home delivery services, film shoots, and roadside eateries, among other categories, likely led to a surge that created a backlog in several testing laboratories in Mumbai. Recognising the delay caused in supplying these reports, Mumbai’s Municipal Commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal on Monday asked all the laboratories to issue reports to the municipal body within 24 hours. The civic body has also advised laboratories to enter data of the samples processed, between midnight to 6 am starting immediately, so that a considerable number of people can be given their results faster. The state’s Break the Chain initiative issued on April 4, which mandated RT-PCR tests for the working-class starting April 10 (the tests would have been valid for 15 days only), was subsequently amended to allow antigen tests. However, several private labs across the city said that reports are now taking between two to three days, and samples collection has got delayed too. “For three days last week, we had to completely stop taking new clients,” said Dr A Velumani, chairman and managing director of Thyrocare, a private company which began conducting RT-PCR tests in its laboratories last year. The reports are now taking 36 hours to be issued, as the company has seen a weekly jump of 20% in samples collected since mid-February. “In at least 100 cases last week, we have issued reports to travellers who were already at the airport to board flights,” he said. “After the first wave passed, the volume had come down to 2000 samples a day, but it suddenly jumped to 15,000 a day this February when we entered the second wave,” he said. Thyrocare’s collection and testing capacity is 12,000 samples per day at present. By the second week of May, their labs will process 17000 samples a day, Velumani added. Metropolis, another private laboratory in the city is doubling its capacity in a week’s time. However, its spokesperson did not provide data on the laboratory’s current testing capacity and how much it would be after the scale-up. Between April 5 and April 10, the city has tested between 47,000 to 52,000 samples daily.“Mumbai’s current RT-PCR testing capacity stands at 45,000,” said a civic official who did not wish to be named. “If the cases don’t increase further, this capacity is enough. During the first wave, the city’s daily testing capacity was 25,000,” the official added. In June and July last year when Mumbai’s cases began to rise during the first wave of the pandemic, reports took up to 48 hours. However, as labs scaled up their facilities, reports were given within 24 hours.“The RT-PCR processing takes about four hours. The transportation and data entry takes more time with a greater load of samples,” the official quoted above said, adding that data automation and early transportation can help save some time in between. In Mumbai, testing follows a three-step process: collection of samples, processing in the laboratory and data entry in the software provided by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) last year mandated that only negative reports could be directly communicated to the patient. Positive reports are first communicated to the civic body, which, in turn, informs the patients. The rule allowed the civic body to conduct effective contact tracing as well as centralize the bed distribution system to ensure that patients don’t crowd hospitals and are treated based on their symptoms. However, residents said that the rule has increased delays, and also led to greater anxiety among possible Covid patients.City-based physician Dr Pratit Samdani said that most of the reports are now taking three to four days to reach patients, which is also causing difficulty in deciding the course of treatment. “Most doctors are initiating the treatment based on the clinical diagnosis. But the patients don’t isolate properly till they see a positive report and this is leading to more infections,” Samdani said. Delayed results have also posed other problems for city residents. Thane-based commercial photographer Amit Rane (46) cancelled his flight to Bhubaneshwar twice last week after none of the laboratories could guarantee him a Covid-19 test report before he took off. “I felt helpless with all that was happening. I lost ₹16,000 on the flights in a week,” said Rane, who has rescheduled his photoshoot in Odisha, which like many other states is demanding negative RT-PCR reports from the 72-hour time frame from travellers. “The problem is that no laboratory is willing to give reports that soon,” said Rane. He finally booked his flight on April 14 after the private laboratory advised him to give his sample directly at their Navi Mumbai collection centre for quicker results. Last March, Pune’s National Institute of Virology was the only laboratory equipped to test for Sars-CoV-2 in samples. Since then, Maharashtra has scaled up its testing capacity tremendously: from 339 laboratories in August to 476 in November and 487 in December. By March 2021, 524 laboratories are conducting tests in the city; of these, 383 are government-run. These numbers provided by the public health department include laboratories carrying out RT-PCR as well as antigen tests. In Mumbai, around 43 private and 10 public-run laboratories are testing samples.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-laboratories-swamped-with-samples-for-covid-tests-for-patients-travellers-101618257157984.html
13-04-2021||Mumbai||Professional colleges wary of repeat of 2020||Manasvi Parikh, 19, cleared her Class 12 board exam in June last year, however, her first lecture as a first-year law student began only two weeks ago. With the state’s decision to postpone SSC and HSC exams to June this year, students as well as colleges are worried about a repeat of academic year 2020-21. “We were worried that the current batch of first-year students will end up studying in the same class as the first-year batch of the 2021-22 academic year because the current year admission concluded only recently. But with Covid-19 lockdown spilling into the next academic year, looks like the next batch will be equally delayed,” said the principal of a south Mumbai law college, on condition of anonymity. Admissions to most professional courses were delayed by a few months in 2020-21, first due to the lockdown and then due to a petition filed in the Bombay high court for clarity on the status of the Maratha quota. In December, registration process for most professional courses, including law, engineering, architecture and pharmacy, had to be delayed by a few weeks to give students time to make necessary changes to their admission form after the state decided to continue admissions without the inclusion of the Socially and Educationally Backward Classes (SEBC) quota. Government and private engineering colleges in the state started their lectures for their first-year students only towards the end of January 2021. “The central bodies finished admissions to Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) by the last week of November, but the state common entrance test (CET) cell was still conducting registration till end of December. In the coming year too, engineering admissions to non-IIT institutes will be affected if the CET cell does not act quickly,” said Gopakumaran Thampi, principal of Thadomal Shahani Engineering College in Bandra. He added that for the current first-year batch, colleges have planned their first semester exams online this month and hope to finish the second semester by July 2021. Due to the status of Covid-19 across the country, officials are now contemplating postponing entrance exams to all professional courses this year. While the National Testing Agency (NTA) is yet to clarify the status of the third session of Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) Mains, scheduled to take place in the last week of April, parents and students are already unhappy about how this delay will affect students and their preparation for a very important year of their lives. “School education boards should plan online exams for Class 10 and 12 students instead of postponing exams. What happens if the situation doesn’t improve until May or even June? Does the government expect Class 10 and 12 students to live in this anxiety for months,” asked Sudha Shenoy, parent of a medical student and an activist. She added that delay in the academic structure of Class 10 and 12 students for two consecutive years will have a cascading effect on their future courses as well.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/professional-colleges-wary-of-repeat-of-2020-101618257097986.html
13-04-2021||Mumbai||SSC, HSC exams deferred: Degree admissions may be delayed again||The state’s decision to postpone Class 10 and 12 board exams has once again brought back fears of delayed admissions for junior as well as degree college courses. While the education department is hoping it won’t affect admissions for 2021-22, college heads are not sure. Anushree Lokur, principal in-charge, Ramnarain Ruia Autonomous College, Matunga, said the delay is now inevitable. “The largest chunk of students every year for traditional and non-traditional courses comes from the state board, so we cannot start admissions before Class 12 results are announced across all education boards,” she said. Last year, admissions to undergraduate degree courses affiliated with the University of Mumbai began in August, and looking at a large number of seats left vacant after three common admission rounds, the university had requested colleges to release a fourth merit list. “Like every year, we will wait for results of Class 12 exams to be released, and the university will try to wrap up the admission process as early as possible,” said an official from MU. He added that with online lectures, colleges will be able to cover the curriculum, even if admissions get delayed by a few weeks. For junior college admissions, principals said a delay in starting the new term can be managed with online classes. “Our first-year junior college (FYJC) classes began in late December. The online mode gives us more time to teach in comparison with the physical mode. Barring public holidays, we did not take any break and managed to finish our syllabus this month with proper teaching,” said Vidyadhar Joshi, vice-principal of VG Vaze college in Mulund.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/ssc-hsc-exams-deferred-degree-admissions-may-be-delayed-again-101618257038630.html
13-04-2021||Mumbai||No meals on flights if journey is less than 2 hours, says MoCA||No meals will be provided to passengers whose air journey is less than two hours. In order to control the spread of Covid-19 pandemic, the ministry of civil aviation (MoCA) on Monday issued an order restricting airlines from serving food to passengers with flying time less than two hours. The ministry, however, has allowed meals for flights flying for more than two hours, provided the airlines use disposable cutlery and serve only pre-packed food. This order will come into effect from Thursday (April 15).According to the MoCA order, for flights which are allowed to serve food, the tray set up, plates and cutlery in all classes should be completely disposable and no re-use or cleaned and disinfected rotables should be used. It also said that used rotables should be thoroughly cleaned and disinfected before reusing them. Tea, coffee, alcoholic and non- alcoholic beverages have been allowed only in disposable cans or bottles or glasses. “There will be no pouring services and beverages will be served in single-use disposable units and all the disposables will be disposed in trash bags or carts by the crew at the end of the meal service,” the order read.MoCA asked all operating crew members to wear a fresh set of gloves for every meal or beverage service. It also asked the airlines to inform passengers about these amended norms by making announcements. “The service of in-flight meals is to be staggered among the adjacent seats as far as possible,” the order concluded.Central government had earlier restricted serving meals during flight after it resumed flying for the domestic sector in phased manner. This was being done as a precautionary measure to avoid spread of the Sars-CoV-2 virus which causes Covid-19. However, on August 29, it allowed selling in-flight meals, which is a significant source of ancillary revenue for low-cost airlines. While airlines can only serve pre-packed snacks and beverages in domestic flights, they ca serve hot meals and alcohol in international flights.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/no-meals-on-flights-if-journey-is-less-than-2-hours-says-moca-101618257038042.html
13-04-2021||Mumbai||SSC, HSC exams postponed: Mixed response in Maha||The state government’s decision on Monday to postpone HSC and SSC exams saw a mixed response from various stakeholders. While some welcomed the move, others said the government should have instead gone for internal assessments to avoid future uncertainty. Anubha Sahai, president of the Indiawide Parents Association, a group of parents that petitioned the government to cancel offline exams, said, “The decision will just push the uncertainty further because we do not know what the situation will be in June. The government should instead mark students on the basis of internal assessments. Postponement will not help as students and parents are already under a lot of stress.”Reema Lokesh, a city-based parent, said all boards should give two options to students and parents. “Those who wish can opt for results with internal assessments and those who wish to write the exams can do so. This way, students can decide what’s best for them and take a call accordingly,” she added. Rupa Roy, principal, Balmohan Vidya Mandir in Dadar, said the postponement comes as a big relief for schools and students. “Schools were extremely worried about conducting the exams in the middle of growing infections. We are happy that the safety of students has taken prominence over anything else. The days to come are going to be challenging for teachers too. They will not get any summer vacations and will have to manage both – the existing Class 10 students and teaching the new batch of students who will go in Class 10 this year simultaneously,” she added. Shivnath Darade, secretary of Shikshak Parishad, a teachers’ group, said, “We had conducted an online survey with 3000 responses. A total of 69% respondents had demanded the exams be postponed. This included students, teachers and parents. We are happy with the postponement.” Sandeep Deshpande, spokesperson, Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS), said “We wanted these students to be promoted without taking exams, but we are okay if the exams are postponed.” MNS chief Raj Thackeray had advocated promoting students without exams on the grounds that it was stressful for students, especially due to the Covid-19 second wave.BJP leader and former school education minister Ashish Shelar said, “There were concerns among the parents and students appearing for the board exams. We have received requests from many of them and in turn, we had requested the state government for postponement. We thank the state government for the decision.”With inputs from Naresh Kamath||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/ssc-hsc-exams-postponed-mixed-response-in-maha-101618256978021.html
13-04-2021||Mumbai||State postpones SSC and HSC exams amid rising Covid-19 cases||The Maharashtra government on Monday postponed SSC (Class 10) and HSC (Class 12 exams) owing to the rising number of Covid-19 cases in the state. While the Higher Secondary Certificate (HSC) exams will begin towards the end of May, the Secondary School Certificate (SSC) exams will be conducted in June 2021, said state education minister Varsha Gaikwad. The HSC exams were earlier scheduled to take place between April 23 and May 21, 2021, while the SSC exams were planned between April 29 and May 20. Nearly 3.3 million students appear for Class 10 and 12 exams from the state board every year. The exams are conducted simultaneously across 9 divisions in the state. A revised timetable of the exams is yet to be released by the department and will be out soon. “Keeping in mind the safety of students, we have decided to postpone the exams. While postponing exams, we also want to make sure that future education plans of students are not affected,” said Gaikwad in a video message released on Monday afternoon. The decision was finalised in a meeting held between state education minister Varsha Gaikwad, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and officials of the state government and education department on Monday. The state government has written to heads of other boards like the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) and Indian Certificate of Secondary Education (ICSE), requesting a similar postponement in the exams of these boards for students in the state. “We will approach them now that the government has taken a decision in this regard,” said an official from the state education department. CBSE exams are scheduled across the country between May 4 and June 14. While ICSE (Class 10) exams will be held between May 5 and June 7, ISC (Class 12) exams will be held between May 5 and June 16. Representatives of the CBSE and the ICSE boards did not respond to calls and messages. It was on January 21 that the state board had announced dates for SSC and HSC exams. However, with rising infections in the state, several representations were made to the education department and the government from parents and schools, requesting authorities to either postpone exams, conduct them online or mark students on the basis of internal assessments. There has been a big jump in the number of infections in the state between January and April this year. While there were 2,886 cases in Maharashtra on January 21, Mumbai recorded 527 new infections that day. The numbers, however, rose to 63,294 and 9,986 respectively on April 11. The education department held consultations with various stakeholders like parents, schools, educationists and representatives of various online platforms to come up with possible solutions. Representatives of online companies like Google and TCS stated that conducting online exams on such a large scale would require a well-developed infrastructure, a process that might take two years. Since online exams were not feasible and as schools have remained online for the last one year, offline exams at a further date were suggested to be the best possible solution by experts. “During the consultations, various alternative assessment options were evaluated, keeping the health, well-being and future of our students in mind. Postponing exams seemed to be the most pragmatic solution,” said Gaikwad. Schools said that the decision is a welcome step to ensure the safety and wellbeing of students and staff. “We are happy with the postponement. We hope that this will ease the stress of both teachers and parents,” said a suburban school principal. Maharashtra is the worst-affected state by Covid-19 ever since the start of the pandemic last March.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/state-postpones-ssc-and-hsc-exams-amid-rising-covid-19-cases-101618256918580.html
13-04-2021||Other||Surge in cases leads to lack of beds for Covid-19 patients in Navi Mumbai||Between March 29 and April 2, Mahek Mukadam has barely had a moment’s rest. The 34-year-old Vashi resident received a call last Monday from the Covid centre where her father was admitted. “Your father’s condition is deteriorating. Please shift him to an ICU [Intensive Care Unit] bed,” the caller from the City and Industrial Development Corporation (Cidco) Exhibition Centre – a jumbo Covid Care Facility with 1,200 beds which came up in May 2020 told her. Saleem Bhatkar, 59, had got admitted to the centre on March 24 after he tested positive for the coronavirus disease. Soon after the call, Mukadam began the search: she visited at least 20 hospitals, she said, between Panvel and Airoli. Not one had an ICU bed free. “He was already on bypass oxygen bed and yet he needed an ICU. We were continuously getting calls from the center to look for an ICU bed. I would have visited at least 20 private hospitals right from Panvel to Airoli. We were told there were no beds. After a lot of struggle we managed to find one ICU room at Rajpal Hospital in Kopar Khairne,” she said. But by then, Bhatkar’s condition had worsened. The hospital asked Mukadam to look for plasma donors – a secondary level treatment that many doctors have taken to providing though a September study by the Indian Council for Medical Research pointed out that plasma therapy did not help in reducing mortality rates or progression of the disease to a severe state. Nevertheless, it’s a popular therapy employed by doctors in moderately symptomatic patients, but the rub is, only 1% of at least 2.3 million recovered patients have donated plasma to date. By the time Mukadam found a donor, it was too late. On April 2, Bhatkar breathed his last. “At Cidco centre, he saw a patient die and he panicked. While he was being taken to the ICU, he wanted to speak, but couldn’t because of the oxygen mask. Everything took a toll on his mental health. He just wanted to come home,” Mukadam said. On Monday, 1,074 new cases were reported in Navi Mumbai, taking the tally to 85,950. The city also reported four deaths, taking toll to 1,241. Active cases stand at 11,579.The Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC) already had a system in place as the second wave surged in the state. Navi Mumbai which comprises eight wards and a population of 1.2 million, has been seeing close to 1,000 cases daily, on average since the beginning of April 2021. Those with mild symptoms must quarantine at home, and a doctor assigned by the NMMC’s Covid-19 war room checks on them. If a person needs to be admitted to a hospital, the area’s medical officer should be contacted, and they would arrange for a bed at the nearest Covid Care Centre. This system was put in place following the pandemic, which raged through the state last year, claiming 1,080 lives in Navi Mumbai alone. Though the corporation’s capacity has increased – last September, for instance, the corporation had 2,856 beds, and 700 healthcare workers; by March 31, 2021, it had 3,500 beds and 1,000 healthcare workers – people like Mukadam are still dealing with the repercussions of not being able to find beds on time to save lives. In many ways, it feels like a repetition of last year’s tragedy. The biggest challenge that the corporation faces is one of trained healthcare staff. As of now, the corporation has 891 contractual medical staff and is in the process of hiring more. NMMC commissioner Abhijit Bangar said, “Last year around 700 staff members were hired. Now, their contracts have been renewed, but that number is still not enough. With increasing cases, we need to arrange at least 3,000 beds more. But for that we need the medical staff.” However, Bangar pointed out that there is a marked difference between last year’s expression of the pandemic, and what the second wave seems to be presenting. “Last year the demand was more for ventilators and ICU beds. This time, with more asymptomatic and mild infection cases, the demand is more for the Covid Care Centre beds. During the last surge, of the total positive cases, around 3% used to be admitted to ICU while this year, it has come down to 1%,” he said. All the same, the NMMC dashboard reveals that only 28% of the ICU beds are available in the city, while 10% of the isolation beds with oxygen and 49% of the isolation beds without oxygen are available. At present, 3,435 people are hospitalized in Navi Mumbai, and 11,050 are active cases. There are three types of containment zones: In gated, housing societies, the number of cases determine whether the flat, floor or entire building would be declared as a containment zone. For independent houses, a banner comes up depending on the proximity of other houses. “The actual barricading is done at the slums and chawls when cluster cases found. After barricading, police bandobast is provided 24/7. However, with the increasing cases, it is not possible for the police to provide bandobast in all containment areas,” Bangar said. There are 15 containment zones in type three in two wards. Bangar said that the corporation received 40,000 Covishield vaccines from central government on April 1. On average, around 2,000 to 3,000 vaccinations took place daily in March; since April 1, when vaccination opened up for 45 year-olds and above without co-morbidities, at least 7000 vaccinations are being given daily. By April 11, 154,500 Covishield and 28,740 Covaxin vaccines had been supplied to NMMC, of which 15,000 Covaxin remained, which would be administered for the second dose starting April 12. “While senior citizens were the most affected last time, this time the office-going age group from 20 to 50 is most affected. My vision is to have 10,000 daily vaccination but for that we need uninterrupted vaccine supply,” Bangar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/surge-in-cases-leads-to-lack-of-beds-for-covid-19-patients-in-navi-mumbai-101618256918059.html
13-04-2021||Mumbai||Maha plans for lockdown, relief||The Maharashtra government again held a number of meetings on Monday to deliberate on the strict lockdown, which is likely to be announced in a day or two. The relief package for the vulnerable sections of society has almost been finalised, while a decision over the restrictions on the industrial units is expected to be taken by Tuesday.The state is expected to make the announcement on April 14, after a cabinet meeting, and implement it from the evening of April 15. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray has made it clear after meetings with leaders from all parties on Saturday that there would be no option, but to go for a lockdown amid the rising cases of Covid-19 in the state. Thackeray on Sunday held meetings with the state government-appointed task force’s doctors and officials to deliberate upon the modalities and duration of the lockdown. The task force members have recommended the lockdown to be at least for two weeks.State public health minister Rajesh Tope said that the lockdown is inevitable but the government was tapping the ways to reduce its impact. “We held a couple of meetings with various departments on Monday. The measures for the preparations were discussed in the meetings. We want to make sure that the people from the lower strata are not impacted. Besides the food for this section of the society during the lockdown, the period will also be utilised for the augmentation of health infrastructure,” he said.He said that the people will be given ample time for preparing for the lockdown.Leaders from opposition, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), and even the ruling parties have demanded a relief package for the poor and lower strata of the population directly affected during the lockdown. Admitting to the demand, the state government has prepared a plan for the package and bear the financial burden for it. “The plan has been discussed for the relief package to the labourers and poor people who get affected during the lockdown. It will be finalised after discussing with chief minister Uddhav Thackeray,”said Eknath Shinde, urban development minister after the meeting.Shinde said that the decision over the lockdown has been done as there was no other option. “The final decision will, however, be taken by the CM,” he said.Though the decision over the lockdown has to be taken by the CM, he wants the consensus of all ruling parties over itm by discussing it in the cabinet, said a NCP leader.According to officials from the finance department, the relief package will focus on the population from the lower strata and the people who are largely dependent on daily wages. “Foodgrains including rice and pulses were distributed through PDS during the last lockdown until November last year under Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana. 2.5 million metric tonnes of rice was distributed to about 16 million ration card holders. In the absence of the central scheme, the state government will have to launch its own scheme by bearing the cost. Similarly, its ongoing Shiv Bhojan Thali, distributed for Rs5, will have to be extended to a large extent. All these schemes will be part of the package,” the official said.Food and civil supplies minister Chhagan Bhajbal wrote a letter to the CM on Monday demanding distribution of grains to the poor through ration shops. “There is need to provide essential commodities like pulses, edible oil, sugar and salt free of cost or at concessional rate to the poor during the lockdown. Many elected representative have demanded this by writing to us. State government should launch Chief Minister Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana to provide the essential commodities and the decision needs to be taken immediately,” he has said.The state government has started preparing the SOP for the lockdown and is expected to be finalised in a day or two. “There are differences of opinion over the operation of industrial units and the permission for private vehicles. The decision is expected to be taken by the government after more deliberations with experts. The state is likely to shut industrial units barring those in the manufacturing of essential commodities, including food items, pharmaceutical commodities and the articles needed for their packing. There would not be any restrictions on the public transport, including trains, buses and taxi-autos, to ensured that the vaccination drive and the ongoing exams are affected. The state government is expected to bring the lockdown into effect from April 15 by announcing it a day or two in advance,” said an official from relief and rehabilitation department.In the meeting chaired by deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, district collectors have been asked to closely monitor the distribution of the anti-viral injection, Remdesivir, to avoid their black marketing. He also announced to allow to expend 30% of the district planning committee fund on Covid-19 related expenditure. “To avoid the delay in providing infrastructure to the beds procured in the private hospitals, the powers of purchase have been given to the divisional commissioners. The district collectors have been asked to monitor the supply of Remdesivir injections,” the statement from the DCM office has stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maha-plans-for-lockdown-relief-101618256859118.html
13-04-2021||Lucknow||Covid19 spike spoils Lucknow’s eating-out scene!||The surge in Covid-19 cases and the night curfew in the state capital have already hit restaurants hard. They were still recovering from last year’s lockdown and the unlock phase, when this wave has left customers wary of eating out.Chef and restaurateur Nittin Mohan opened his restaurant only in February after the lockdown last year and with sudden rise in cases closed it for dining on April 8. “From Tuesday, we are closing deliveries and our convenience store too. It’s a proactive measure that we have taken for our staff and customers. Cases are rising rapidly so we need to protect our staff and our customers with whom we deal with. After a week we will see the situation and take a call as it’s about everyone’s safety,” he said.A popular city Awadhi-food joint has decided to close two of its restaurants. “Our dine-in restaurant near the Press Club will be shut down for the time-being. Besides, we will soon take a call to close another. With night curfew on, we have to start closing by 7:30-8 pm as the staff too needs time to wind-up and reach home. Sales have dipped by 60-70%, as during summer, people don’t venture out during the day and in the evening we close early,” said Arshi Jamal.Anup Kanchan, an educationist and foodie echoes similar sentiments. “Ab dar lagne laga hai! Before Navratri, there is a usual practice to get some non-vegetarian stuff for dinner but this time, it’s better to control our cravings and be safe with ghar-ka-khana!” Bollywood actor and reality TV star Ankita Srivastava recently opened Kamli Bistro in Gomti Nagar but got a shocker soon after. “We opened the bistro after Holi believing that things would improve. The night curfew has affected the business badly. We have tastefully set-up everything with a lavish menu and ambience, but the cases started rising suddenly. Customers are just not venturing out and we have no idea what to do…can just wait and watch.” This time, the spike in cases has been sharp so the fear is immense. “The current situation is one of panic. People are not dining-in. Instead, food is being packed and taken home, but that too is not too great. We are once again in for losses but for our staff we need to run things. Big marriage parties that were lined-up are either getting postponed or are being reduced to 40-50-people affairs. We are in for a very tough time,” said Manoj Bachaani of Richi Rich restaurant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/covid19-spike-spoils-lucknow-s-eating-out-scene-101618256858537.html

13-04-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Police officer dies of Covid-19||A 54-year-old sub inspector attached to Vakola police station died of Covid-19 on Monday while undergoing treatment at the Bandra-Kurla Complex (BKC) Covid care facility. With this, the Covid-19 toll in the Mumbai Police reached 101 with a total of 7,997 cases of infection reported since April 2020. As of Monday, the city police force has 455 active infected policemen.Sub-inspector Mohan Dagde, who had been assigned court-related works and was posted at the Bombay high court, last reported to work on April 2. The next day he tested positive for Covid-19 and got admitted at the BKC Covid care centre. His condition deteriorated on Sunday, leading to his death, said a police officer. “Dagde was diabetic and had high blood pressure,” confirmed Sunayna Nate, senior inspector, Vakola police. Despite being from the 50+ age group, Dagde was reporting to work and not staying at home as directed by senior police officers earlier to prevent spread of infection among the most vulnerable group of policemen from the force. The department is looking into why a policeman from 50+ age group having comorbidities such as diabetes and high blood pressure was called on duty, a police officer said requesting anonymity.Dagde was living with his family in Andheri police quarters. His family would get a compensation of ₹50 lakh from the state government. Beside this, a sum of ₹10 lakh would also be given from the Mumbai Police welfare fund.With the surge in Covid-19 cases, more policemen are also getting infected. Hence, the department is restoring measures that were implemented to bring the infection under control last year. The police have recently restored the Covid helpline for cops to enquire about availability of beds at hospitals and Covid centres. “We are taking all possible measures to prevent the spread of the virus in the police department,” said Vishwas Nangre Patil, joint commissioner of police (law and order).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-police-officer-dies-of-covid19-101618256797949.html

The Shiromani Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee (SGPC) will hold a religious programme, while the Bhartiya Kisan Union (Ekta Ughrahan) has given a call for a ‘Kisan Rally’ on Tuesday.Talwandi subdivision officer Varinder Singh said instructions from the state government have been sought, as a huge gathering is expected at the events. He evaded a direct reply on whether the local administration has granted permission to hold mass programmes.Over the past week (since April 5), Bathinda has reported 1,396 new covid cases, while the active number of patients on Monday was 1,494. After a review meeting with medical experts on pandemic control management, chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh, on April 7, had announced a complete ban on all political, social, cultural or sports gatherings till April 30.The CM had directed officials to take action against violators, even if they are political leaders, and even asked the administration to book them under the Disaster Management and Epidemics Act.Sources said there was no specific reference to the ban on mass gatherings organised by religious bodies or farmer unions protesting since September last year against the Centre’s three contentious farm laws.Paramjit Singh, manager, Gurdwara Damdama Sahib at Takht Damdama Sahib, one of the five temporal seats of Sikhism, said in view of the expected rush of devotees at the shrine, special stay arrangements have been made. He appealed to devotees to follow covid-19 instructions, including wearing masks and maintain social distancing, religiously.On Monday, BKU (Ughrahan) spokesman Jasvir Singh said union president Joginder Singh Ughrahan and other farm leaders from Punjab and Haryana will participate in Tuesday’s rally. Civil surgeon TS Dhillon said the health department will deploy a special awareness van where people will be motivated to follow covid guidelines. “Teams will also be stationed for on-the-spot sample collection and covid vaccination,” he added.The district administration has deployed its own police, and from adjoining districts as well, to maintain law and order during the twin events at Talwandi Sabo.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/baisakhi-amid-covid-sgpc-event-farmers-rally-in-talwandi-sabo-today-despite-capt-s-ban-orders-101618256738716.html
13-04-2021||Mumbai||Kalyan leads with highest progressive Covid-19 cases in MMR||The Kalyan Dombivli Municipal Corporation (KDMC), which had seen its highest peak of Covid-19 cases last year in July with 661 cases and had the highest progressive cases in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) with nearly 17,000 cases, is again leading with more than 100,000 cases and around 2,000-2,500 new cases reported daily. On Monday, KDMC recorded 1,527 cases, taking the tally to 103,384. The city did not report any new death, so toll remains 1,160. The civic body had, on Sunday, crossed the 100,000-cases mark with 2,552 new cases taking the case count to 101,857. According to the civic body, the case positivity rate stands at 18%. KDMC has ramped up testing to around 6,000-6,500 daily tests from around 2,500-3,000 tests conducted in July last year. As the case fatality rate stands at 0.19%, down from 1.95% in October 2020, KDMC claims the situation is in control.“Although cases are increasing, the fatality rate is less as compared to earlier months, which is a major relief. The cumulative death rate since beginning is 1.5%. Our main focus is on controlling deaths,” said Vijay Suryavanshi, KDMC commission. Activists from the city claim the major reason behind the surge in cases is lack of maintaining Covid-appropriate behaviour such as social distancing, wearing masks at the ground level, and added that the civic body is not carrying out sanitisation work at the centres, hospitals and other crowded places like it was doing earlier. “When I went to take vaccine, I could see social distancing was not maintained properly by the people. The administration has done a lot by providing testing facility and building infrastructure, but people are not following the norms,” said Sreeniwas Ghanekar, founder of Alert Citizens Forum, Kalyan. He added, “I have also noticed that earlier when the cases were on rise the civic body used to carry out sanitisation on a regular basis, but now I can hardly see sanitisation happening at any of the centres or hospitals.” Residents also claimed that the civic body has not taken strict action against those violating Covid norms in all parts of the city. “Even though the civic body and police claim that they have been taking action against those violating norms, this is not happening in every corner of the city on a regular basis. Even now, when shops are asked to shut, some are still operating if civic officials are not around,” said Swaraj Patil, 39, a resident of Khadakpada, Kalyan (West). Since January 21 this year to April 9, KDMC and police have taken action against 4,601 people for not wearing mask and collected ₹20.32 lakh in fines. Kalyan zone 3 police have also registered a total of 1,191 cases. A KDMC official who did not wish to be named said, “We do not have enough manpower to take action against violators when compared to the population. Those who are taking action against violators also have their routine works to do, hence there is no regular drive.” The civic body also pointed at housing societies for not maintaining norms. Ashwini Patil, KDMC medical health officer, said, “Most of the cluster cases are in housing complexes while slums have very less cases. Residents are not following home isolation strictly, which is leading to the spread.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/kalyan-leads-with-highest-progressive-covid-19-cases-in-mmr-101618256677994.html

The officers will work in two shifts — 3pm to 11pm and 11pm to 7am — to ensure patients get beds round the clock.However, the patients who call the ward war room between 11pm and 7 am, will be allotted beds predominantly at jumbo Covid facilities only. Nodal officers at ward war rooms are expected to fast-track bed allotment at night, and to ensure this, they will stay in touch with the seven jumbo facilities at all times. Once the beds are allotted to the patients, they will have to reach the facility and will be allotted a bed after assessing the medical condition and requirement of the patient. Municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal made an announcement to this effect on Monday morning.In addition, those who call the ward war rooms at night but have not received their test report or have not been tested, will be entitled to beds in such facilities under the suspected category and a test will be conducted to ascertain if they have contracted the disease.The city on Monday reported 6,893 new Covid-19 cases and 43 deaths, taking case count to 425,091 and toll to 12,066.

Of these beds, around 1,400 will be oxygen beds.With the steady rise in Covid-19 cases, the civic body has decided to requisition some four-star and five-star hotels to create Covid quarantine facilities (CCC2) for positive patients, to be run by professionals from major private hospitals. With this, BMC plans to make large number of beds available to needy patients by shifting substantially recovered patients to these CCC2 facilities.BMC will also add 1,100 additional hospital beds including 125 ICU beds within the next week. As of Monday afternoon, Mumbai has 19,329 hospital beds for Covid-19 patients of which 3,878 are vacant. Of the 2,542 ICU beds, 60 are vacant, 20 of the 1,330 ventilator beds, and 1,394 of 9,934 oxygen beds are vacant.All laboratories have been instructed to ensure that Covid-19 test results are concluded within 24 hours without fail. The labs have also been instructed to give priority to swabs of symptomatic patients. In addition, labs have been asked to submit reports of patients who tested positive by 6am every morning, in a bid to ensure that such patients get beds by 8am the same day and within 24 hours of their swab collection. Presently, positive reports of patients who get tested in the first half of the day are submitted to BMC by midnight the same day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-civic-body-s-ward-war-rooms-for-covid-19-to-operate-at-night-too-101618256557998.html

There has been a spurt in Covid cases since the last week of March and health workers were working at OPDs without too many restrictions in place,” said Dr MMA Faridi, principal, Era Lucknow Medical College, where at least over a dozen staff tested positive. At the King George’s Medical University (KGMU), over 200 staff members tested positive in the past two weeks. Restrictions, including mandatory Covid report of patients visiting OPDs, have been introduced since Monday. “The crisis, you may say, has begun. This is because some staff has to be given leave for three or more days, if they report any illness or symptom. This unplanned leave is putting extra burden on those on duty when hospitals are already under pressure,” said Dr PK Gupta, former president, IMA, Lucknow. “Three of my lab staff is on leave after reporting illness,” he added. “We have introduced new measures in the OPD. Apart from making Covid report mandatory for patients visiting select OPDs, other OPDs have been shifted to digital platform, to ensure zero contact between patient and doctor,” said Dr Sudhir Singh, spokesperson, KGMU. He said, “Reserve teams have already been formed for the next two rounds of Covid duty. Each round of Covid duty is of 14 days. We have to ensure that Covid ward gets uninterrupted manpower, and for the purpose, list of staff for the next two rounds has been made,” added Sudhir. Meanwhile, Dr Ram Manohar Lohia Institute of Medical Sciences announced helplines (telephone numbers) for OPD patients. “We request patients not to come to the campus unless it is unavoidable,” said Dr Srikesh Singh, spokesperson of the institute. Bed strength is also being enhanced in Lucknow. The current strength of 537 ICU beds at 29 hospitals will be increased to 48 as Balrampur Hospital is being converted into a Covid facility with 215 beds, including 167 isolation beds. “ICU beds will go up by another 10 in the next few days and total bed strength will be 300. We are making efforts to ensure adequate manpower and reserve staff is being told to be on standby in case the ones listed fall ill,” said Dr GP Gupta, of Balrampur Hospital. Lucknow has so far reported 1,11,286 Covid cases and 1,353 deaths.

So, people of Punjab with all their might must ensure victory in this rare struggle that has never been seen in this country earlier.”Rajewal, who is also the president of Bharatiya Kisan Union (Rajewal), said, “We all are here not to fight for others, but ourselves as the story of our destruction is being penned by the BJP government at the Centre with enactment of these farm laws.” BKU (Charuni) leader Gurnam Singh Charuni said, “The government wants to crush this unprecedented people’s movement in the name Covid-19 outbreak. Where is this virus in the poll-bound states where BJP leaders are addressing massive rallies which are being attended of thousands?”“The Modi government has forgotten that it has been elected by the people and its primary duty is to address their problems. But instead, it is playing into the hands of market forces and corporate houses,” Ruldu Mansa said.Actor Sonia Mann also addressed the rally, while Punjabi singers performed in support of farmers’ agitation.

A single-judge bench of justice Revati Mohite-Dere, while hearing the interim application in criminal appeal filed by an 87-year-old man and his wife, 81, was informed by advocate Dinesh Tiwari that on March 11 the special Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) court had convicted and sentenced the couple for offences punishable under section 6 (aggravated penetrative sexual assault) of the Pocso Act to undergo 10 years rigorous imprisonment. Tiwari informed the bench that the couple had been falsely implicated in the case and the real motive of the complaint was to take over their house. He added that while the minor’s mother stated that both the applicants had sexually assaulted the girl, the child had stated only the man had touched her appropriately and no allegations were made against his wife. Tiwari submitted that in light of these facts, the couple had filed an appeal against the conviction and sought suspension of their sentence till their appeal was heard through the interim application. Additional public prosecutor SV Sonawane for the police and advocate Ameeta Kuttikrishnan, a court-appointed lawyer for the victim, opposed the application. After hearing submissions, the bench observed that initially first information report (FIR) was lodged for an offence punishable under section 354 (assault or use of criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty), and subsequently provisions of section 376 (rape) was added. “The applicants, aged 87 and 81 years, were on bail pending trial and have not abused or misused the liberty granted to them.

HC held that the applicants had “abused the process of law” while surrendering before the magistrate, and immediately applying for bail without being subjected to interrogation in the case – which was serious in nature – and hence, rejected their bail application. The three applicants, a woman and her two daughters, are accused of instigating the woman’s daughter-in-law to commit suicide.The single bench of justice PD Naik, while hearing the bail application of the three women, was informed by advocate Ajinkya Udane that the victim died by suicide last September in Shirur town of Pune district, a month after her husband’s death. A case of suicide was registered against six persons, including her mother-in-law and two sisters-in-law. An application for anticipatory bail for the three accused was filed in the sessions court, the HC and the Supreme Court through a special leave petition, but they were all rejected, and the Apex court directed the women to surrender and then apply for bail before the magistrate. In January, the three accused approached the judicial magistrate first class at Shirur, and based on the SC order, sought to surrender and apply for bail at the same time. The magistrate, however, rejected their bail application, following they approached the sessions court in the first week of February. But after their application was rejected there, they approached HC. After perusing the records, justice Naik observed that the anticipatory bail of the three women had been rejected by all courts, including SC, as the allegations were serious. Similarly, the bail applications were also rejected by the magistrate and sessions court on similar grounds. Justice Naik further noted that the ploy of the women to surrender and immediately apply for bail was not as per the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC), which required an accused to be in custody before being able to apply for bail. However, as the women had not been in custody, the magistrate and sessions court were right in rejecting their bail application. While rejecting the bail application, justice Naik directed the three women to surrender before the magistrate and directed the magistrate to deal with the accused as per law and CrPC, and dismissed the bail application.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bombay-hc-asks-3-accused-in-suicide-case-to-surrender-be-in-custody-before-seeking-bail-101618256317992.html
13-04-2021||Chandigarh||Red Fort violence: Court reserves order on actor-activist Deep Sidhu’s bail plea||A Delhi court Monday reserved its order on the bail application of actor-activist Deep Sidhu, arrested in connection with the Red Fort violence on the Republic Day. Special judge Neelofer Abida Perveen said the order on Sidhu’s bail plea will be pronounced on April 15. Sidhu’s counsel told the court that mere presence did not make him part of unlawful assembly and that he was an honest citizen who was part of a protest. The public prosecutor representing the Delhi Police claimed that Sidhu participated in the protest with the intention to create violence and disregard the national flag and that he was the main instigator of unlawful assembly. Sidhu was arrested on February 9 in connection with the Red Fort violence on the Republic Day during farmers’ tractor parade against the Centre’s three new agri laws. The prosecutor opposed the bail application, claiming that if released, Sidhu will destroy the evidence as he destroyed two phones before he was apprehended. He told the court that before January 25, Sidhu gave interview to media wherein he said “26th (January) is coming..more and more people should come.” The prosecutor read out the transcripts of an interview that Sidhu had given to a news channel and claimed that he admitted in this interview that he broke the barricade. He further quoted from the interview where Sidhu had allegedly claimed to have broken barricades in Punjab on November 26. He claimed that in Sidhu’s presence national flag was disrespected and that he did not try to stop it. The prosecutor claimed that Sidhu was very well aware in advance that protesters at Singhu border will not follow the route. “There was no intention to follow the route. There was a planning to defame our country. They disregarded our national flag. When police tried to stop, they were attacked by mob brutally...more than 144 police personnel received injuries,” the prosecutor said. The investigating officer (IO) added that “There was one lakh reward on him. Police caught him. He was absconding. His role is different from the ones on bail. There can be no parity.” Sidhu’s counsel opposed police’s arguments, saying that the accused was talking about unity in protest.

Usually, around 14 to 15 bodies used to be brought here for traditional cremation, but now around 40 to 45 are brought every day,” said Pandit Narendra Mishra, who is performing the duties of Mahabrahmin at Bhainsakund. In the absence of space on platforms, a few bodies had to be cremated on the riverside. The situation is similar at Gulalaghat, he said. “This indicates poor management of Lucknow Municipal Corporation officials,” said Ranjit Singh, former corporator, who is active in raising problems faced by people at the cremation ground.Mishra said, “The contractor of woods must be directed to keep enough stock of wood and not fleece people coming for cremation of bodies.”One Suman Rawat who went to Bhainsakund on Saturday with the body of his relative accused the wood contractor of fleecing people. “We had to pay ₹7,500 instead of ₹2,500 for the arrangement of wood immediately. Despite our complaint to higher officials of LMC, no action was taken,” said Rawat.“Around 12 truckloads of wood have been brought and from now there would be no shortage. These are unprecedented circumstances and keeping that in mind we have decided to keep a close watch on supply of wood at Bhaisakund, Gulalaghat and Alambagh cremation grounds,” said Ram Nagina Mishra, chief engineer of LMC’s rubbish removal department and also in charge of Bhainsakund.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/cremation-grounds-in-lucknow-shortage-of-wood-making-the-dead-wait-longer-101618256197924.html

These officers were serving in EOW for over five years, said a senior IPS (Indian Police Service) officer. On Monday, HT had first published the story, ‘After crime branch its EOW’s turn to clean up’, explaining how Nagrale has taken at hand the task of shunting out those officers who are enjoying postings in the same department since a long period. On Monday Vishwas Nangre Patil, joint commissioner of police (law and order), who is holding additional charge of joint commissioner of police (administration), issued the transfer order of five inspectors and eight assistant inspector-rank officers from EOW. “These officers served in EOW for over five years and are now transferred to side branches, police stations and traffic divisions,” Patil said.“Generally, a police officer is supposed to serve on a post for a period of three years and then be transferred to other posting. But there are officers in EOW who have been in the department since the past six-seven years,” said a source from EOW. A senior officer indicated that Monday’s transfer can just be the beginning and a huge chunk of officers who are in EOW since long could be shunted out in the upcoming general transfers, slated to be announced in June.Recently, joint commissioner of police (EOW) Niket Kaushik had issued an order to all EOW unit heads, directing them to not assign officers, who have served in the unit for over four years, any new cases.EOW investigates multi-crore financial institution scams, corporate and investment frauds, housing frauds by builders and other white-collar crimes. Cases involving more than ₹6-crore disputes or complex financial crimes are assigned to EOW. On the backdrop of controversies surrounding suspended assistant police inspector Sachin Vaze and former police commissioner Param Bir Singh, Nagrale after taking charge on March 17 first started taking on cops who might have had developed close proximity with “unwarranted elements” by enjoying long tenure in the same department. Within six days of joining, he had shunted out 84 officers, including 65 from the crime branch.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/13-officers-shunted-out-from-mumbai-police-s-eow-as-part-of-clean-up-act-101618256140666.html

However, this time the pandemic may cast a shadow over the pilgrimage. At 5,200 ft, the shrine is one of the holiest Hindu pilgrimages and is visited by a large number of pilgrims from across India and all over the world during the nine auspicious days. Thus, the administration has tightened security and fixed a ceiling of 25,000 pilgrims in a day. Pilgrims arriving in trains to Katra will undergo RAT at the railway station where Covid kiosks for testing have been set up. Those arriving via road will undergo Covid-19 test at Lakhanpur—the gateway to Jammu and Kashmir. Local devotees will undergo Covid 19 rapid antigen tests (RAT) tests at Banganga. However, it is advisable for the pilgrims, coming from outside J&K to bring their Covid-19 negative reports, preferably RT-PCR (reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction )test, not older than 72 hours. Devotional singers invited Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Shrine Board has said it has made elaborate arrangements to facilitate the pilgrims “The shrine board has invited famous bhajan and bhaint (devotional) singers, who will perform in morning and evening atka aarti. In run up to the festival, the board’s CEO Ramesh Kumar on Monday visited bhawan (sanctum sanctorum) and other locations on the track and reviewed the arrangements.

Last year, Mohali slipped to the 157th position in the Centre’s Swachh Survekshan rankings. It was mainly attributed to the municipal corporation’s failure to operationalise its ambitious solid waste management project at Samgoli village.While the state government has failed to expedite the project, the new mayor plans to take the help of resident welfare associations to at least create awareness among citizens about waste segregation. “I will soon hold a meeting with MC officers and will organise awareness camps in various sectors. We will try our level best to improve the city’s ranking,” he said. On rampant encroachments across markets and residential areas, Amarjeet said that he will ensure regular drives for their removal, “without any bias”. “I will constitute a committee which will supervise the anti-encroachment drive. During the previous regime, no such committee was constituted,” he said.The mayor said he will also be holding a meeting with GMADA and police officials to constitute an expert committee, which will address black spots that are leading to accidents on the city roads. Managing finances a challengeAmarjeet has taken over the reins of the civic body when it is heading towards a major financial crisis. Amid scarcity of funds, more than 200 tenders of development works worth ₹30 crore have not been allotted for the past two years. These works pertain to development of parks, laying of paver blocks, construction of footpaths, recarpeting of roads and installation of gyms in parks. In 2020-21, the MC House had approved a budget of ₹268 crore, but the Punjab local bodies department had imposed a cut of ₹141 crore and approved only ₹127 crore. “I will hold a meeting with the state government, requesting them for adequate funds. Development works worth ₹100 crore are already going on in the city. We will not impose any fresh tax, but will ask the residents to pay their dues of water and property tax,” said Amarjeet.Meanwhile, with former senior deputy mayor Rishiv Jain and his councillor wife Raj Rani Jain boycotting the first meeting, it will be a challenge for Amarjeet to keep his flock together. The Congress has won 37 seats out of the total 50 in the House.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/will-make-mohali-most-beautiful-in-tricity-says-new-mayor-101618256138618.html

Long commute to the vaccination centre is another problem. Besides, health problems, such as arthritis among the elderly women, were also found to be the reason why fewer women than men were coming forward to take the jabs.”The study also found that women were hesitant to take the jabs as they had come across some misinformation regarding vaccine safety, on social media. 60 to 69 age group had maximum vaccinationsThe data also showed that the maximum number of vaccinations was seen in the 60 to 69 age group, wherein in 6, 104 persons got jabbed.

A Whatsapp call made to Hiran’s phone on the evening he went missing eventually led the ATS to a bar dancer who in turn, led the investigators to arrest a bookie on suspicion of murder. Hiran, a 48-year-old auto parts businessman was in possession of a Scorpio that was found parked outside industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s residence in February. Hiran’s body washed up ashore the Reti Bunder creek on March 5. The National Investigation Agency (NIA) arrested suspended Mumbai policeman Sachin Vaze in connection with the explosives case on March 13. Last month, the federal agency also took over the probe into the murder case, in which the ATS had arrested two persons including a convicted policeman out on parole. On March 21, the ATS arrested former police constable Vinayak Shinde and cricket bookie Naresh Gor and named Vaze as the alleged mastermind of the murder. The NIA is now in custody of all three men. After scanning the Whatsapp calls made on the evening of March 4, the ATS zeroed in on a particular number which matched the location of Hiran’s house and the approximate time he had left his home on the evening of March 4. The ATS official said that the team reached out to mobile service providers to procure the numbers which were in use at the time. From this, they uncovered the number which was used to call Hiran on his phone.Hiran’s wife, Vimla, had said in her statement to the ATS that Hiran had received a call from an officer named “Tawde” following which he left the home at 8.30pm. Hiran did not return home that night, and when Vimla tried his phone at 11 pm, she said it was switched off. Hiran’s body was found the following morning, but his personal effects including his phone and wallet are still untraceable. The officials were able to find the address that the number was registered on, which led them to a trader in Bhuj, Gujarat. The investigators discovered that the SIM card corresponding to the number was procured by a local trader. When questioned by the Thane ATS unit, he told the police that he had sold 14 SIM cards to a cricket bookie, Naresh Gor. The trader also told the police that Gor had given one of the 14 SIM cards to one of his friends who worked as a bar dancer. The ATS team traced the woman who led them to a hotel in Mumbai which Gor frequently stayed at. In order to book a room, Gor would supply his address and identity card details, she told the investigating team. The officers were then able to find Gor through the Aadhar card details that he had supplied to that hotel. Gor was arrested from Bhuj on March 21. The bookie reportedly revealed the name of a south Mumbai-based club owner through whom he had met former police constable Vinayak Shinde and suspended Mumbai Police officer Sachin Vaze. Gor reportedly told ATS that he had given Shinde and Vaze five of the 14 SIM cards that he had bought from the Bhuj trader. It was one of these SIM cards that was used to contact Hiran on the evening of March 4. The ATS suspect that Shinde or Vaze pretended to be a policeman by the name of Tawde to lure Hiran to a spot along Ghodbunder Road in Thane, following which he was abducted. The call reportedly lasted for 11 minutes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/mansukh-hiran-murder-maharashtra-ats-scanned-9k-callers-to-nab-accused-101618256017941.html

Chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray and deputy chief minister and finance minister Ajit Pawar held meetings with officials and ministers on the issue.Relief and rehabilitation minister Vijay Wadettiwar said the lockdown, if put in place, is expected for two weeks. “As of now, the CM is thinking of a lockdown for a week. But it is not possible to break the chain of transmission in one week; therefore, we may have to go for lockdown for two weeks, looking at the situation. The matter will be discussed in the state cabinet and a decision will be made,” Wadettiwar said. Health minister Rajesh Tope said the government will consider the needs of the people below poverty line before announcing a lockdown. He further said that Pawar has decided to set up liquid oxygen plants in every district, streamline oxygen production and its distribution, and distribution of Remdesivir injections — a life-saving antiviral drug. The state is facing shortage of oxygen and Remdesivir for the past few days, and if the number of cases continues to mount in the coming days, this shortage could result in more fatalities.Tope, who attended the meeting chaired by Pawar, said the distribution of Remdesivir has been streamlined and its price has been capped at ₹1,400. “Today 50,000 injections are available, which will be distributed in two ways. Government hospitals will seek it via the stockist. Private hospitals, too, they must record their order with the stockist of the district. The injections will be given under the supervision of FDA and district collector after filling up a form. There should not be any misuse or irrational use. It will take a day or two to streamline the distribution and it should be sold under ₹1,400.”Regarding the shortage of oxygen supply, Tope said Pawar has directed districts to set up liquid oxygen plants in every district, for which funds will be provided through District Planning and Development Council (DPDC) and State Disaster Relief Fund (SDRF). “We use 100% of the 1,200 metric tonnes of oxygen that is manufactured daily. Monitoring daily production, distribution and refuelling must be done strictly. As many districts do not have liquid oxygen tanks, it has been instructed to build liquid oxygen plants at subdivision level, for which expenditure can be done through DPDC and SDRF funds. It will help save time and transportation,” he said.Govt advisory for Gudi Padwa, RamzanMaharashtra issued advisories, urging people to celebrate Gudi Padwa and observe prayers during Ramzan at home and avoid crowding at public and religious places. Gudi Padwa will be celebrated today whereas Ramzan is expected to start from April 15.

In the backdrop of sharp rise in daily cases, no religious procession or rally be carried at public places and not more than five people should gather at a place.

The Undergraduate Medical Education Board of NMC took the decision following several representations by students citing the crisis created due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The decision brings relief to many students – who have been studying virtually from their hometowns and find it difficult to return to their institutes – to complete the mandatory internship. “Considering the representations and the existing regulatory provisions, it is mandatory that internship should be completed in the teaching hospital affiliated to the medical institute the student is enrolled in. However, in the event of any difficulty due to the current pandemic situation, this internship can be completed at another NMC-approved medical college hospital,” said a statement by the education board. The NMC board statement also highlights that the relaxation is subject to the approval of the college authorities and the university concerned, where the student is enrolled for MBBS training. The board also clarified that this provision, referred to as externship, usually chargeable by the institute, will be without any charges this time. “Every year, hundreds of students wish to come back to their hometowns to complete their internship but are instead burdened with overhead fees in order to be accepted by a hospital of their choice. This year, due to the pandemic, several students are already far from their teaching hospital. So it’s only fair to allow them to continue internships without levying fees,” said Brijesh Sutaria, parent of a medical student. Over the last year, several MBBS students, including from the final-year batch, have been working as part of the Covid-19 task force in government hospitals across the state. Some of them are also demanding that the board consider the Covid-19 work a part of the internship. “The government as well as NMC should also consider the time students spent working as frontline Covid-19 warriors as part of their internship and allow concession to the actual internship period,” said Anubhav Jain, a third-year MBBS student from a Solapur-based medical institute. There are approximately 35,000 students enrolled in 56 undergraduate medical colleges in Maharashtra and the decision will impact roughly 6,000 students eligible for internships in the state. Medical colleges in the state have been conducting offline classes for undergraduate students since last March after the outbreak of the disease. Maharashtra is the worst-hit state with 567,097 active coronavirus cases. It also reported 63,294 cases – the highest daily cases on Sunday – taking the tally to 3,407,245 cases and fatalities to 57,987.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/relief-for-mbbs-students-in-maharashtra-101618255838967.html

Besides, Sunni clerics issued a detailed advisory, defining the dos and don’ts during Ramzan. It stated that Muslims should avoid lavish iftars.“People should avoid iftar at public places, instead they should organize it at their respective places. This will prevent crowding at eating joints. The faithful should maintain social distancing while offering namaz,” he said.Asked how many people will be allowed to offer namaz at a time, he said as there is no instruction from the government about the total strength of namazis to be allowed in mosques, there is no such restriction on people. However, it will be ensured that social distancing is followed while offering namaz, Farangi Mahali. Shia cleric Maulana Kalbe Jawad said: “It is our moral responsibility to get ourselves and our family members vaccinated. Hence people are requested to get themselves vaccinated at the earliest.” He appealed to people to follow Covid protocols, night curfew and organize iftar at home.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/covid-casts-it-shadow-on-navratri-baisakhi-celebrations-101618255662513.html
13-04-2021||Chandigarh||Amid drought-like conditions, water crisis looms large over Himachal||The prevailing drought-like conditions in Himachal Pradesh are threatening perennial water sources and affecting around 700 water supply schemes across the hill-state. The water levels of major rivers have declined along with the amount of rain and snow received by the Himalayan state, which logged a 62% rain deficiency in March. The rising temperature has further caused the water levels in rivers and water reservoirs to deplete. There has been a 75% decline in water sources, which is bound to aggravate the water crisis in rain-fed areas. The repercussions will be graver in rural areas. Around 9,526 schemes cater water to 50,566 habitations in Himachal, of which 2,789 habitations have been affected by the arid climatic conditions. Jal shakti dept ready for all contingencies The jal shakti department has chalked out a master plan to the deal with the looming water crisis. “The plans are ready. The schemes will be interlinked with each other to meet the water requirement. If required, we will also opt for water rationing,” Naveen Puri, engineer-in-chief, Jal Shakti department. “The department has taken steps to check water leakages. We are now able to save around 12 lakh liters of water per day, “ he said .There are around 32 water supply schemes in Mandi that are on the verge of drying up and nearly 80% water supply schemes have been impacted in Dharamshala zone.The water levels have dropped to 75 % and in 83 schemes the water levels vary between 25% to 75%. “In all, at least 220 schemes have been impacted by the dry spell. We are adopting adequate measures to meet the deficiency,” said chief engineer (Mandi zone) Dharmender Gill, adding that people were being sensitised to conserve water. The Jal Shakti department had made a presentation regarding the same before the Cabinet. Minister Mahender Singh Thakur has also apprised chief minister Jai Ram Thakur of the prevailing weather conditions and its impact on the schemes. The CM later held a virtual meeting with the officers. The jal shkati department plans to lift water from irrigation schemes if the drought-like conditions persist. Weather to remain dry in April, May: IMD The weather department has predicted that the weather is likely to remain dry in the April and May. “This is not unusual as there are few rain spells between April and May,” said director, regional metrological department, Manmohan Singh. The acute water crisis that had hit Shimla in 2018 had made the global headlines and the shortage had resulted in scattered midnight protests. Angry residents took to roads and blocked the traffic on town’s main circular road. The MC had to resort to rationing and residents were being supplied water after eight days. Residents had sent out fervent appeals on social networking sites asking tourists to desist coming to Shimla and hordes of visitors returned after the water crisis hit town. Shimla needs 45MLD of water daily to meet its demand but water supply in mid-May, 2018, had dropped to 28 MLD per day . The water crisis had become more acute in the last week of May when the supply fell to 2O MLD. The arid climate in Himachal has already caused extensive damage to Rabi crops and delayed the vegetable sowing in the state .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/amid-drought-like-conditions-water-crisis-looms-large-over-himachal-101618255657910.html

He added that the factory will augment their production capacity to 10 million (one crore) units a year, with a production of four million (40 lakh) premium bicycles and E-Cycles, mostly for global sales.“It is a great moment for us that we are launching this plant on Baisakhi,” said Munjal. An investment of over ₹1,000 crore has been made, over two years, in total outlay to operationalise the E-Cycle Valley and grow Hero International in the EU and UK. The Hero Motor Company (HMC) is spending ₹350 crore on operationalising the E-Cycle Valley, vendors are bringing ₹400 crore. The HMC plans to invest ₹300 crore in R&D and distribution across the EU and the UK.The Suppliers’ Park will localise production of premium components.

13-04-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh Housing Board extends deadline for removing violations||The Chandigarh Housing Board has extended the temporary exemption from immediate demolition of additional constructions in its dwelling units to December 31, 2021, subject to payment of penal charges. The earlier deadline was July 31. Allottees have been allowed to self-certify the area of additional construction to work out the applicable penal charges. “In case of any complaint, we may check the self-declared area and take further action,” said Yashpal Garg, chief executive officer, CHB. The action against such constructions and alterations will be kept pending till December 31. Allottees who do not deposit the penal charges will be issued notices of demolition/cancellation thereafter. Garg said the penalty is imposed in view of the fact that demolition of additional construction at a large scale may eventually be the only alternative. However, the allottees may get some time to rectify these violations in conformity with need-based changes orders, he said.In the latest order, the CHB has rationalised the penalty, and there is only one category instead of two originally.The CHB in 2019 issued a policy to allow residents regularise unauthorised construction in their flats. Originally, the regularisation policy was announced in 2017, but only 40 applications were received even as a CHB survey revealed that 90% of its 60,000-odd dwelling units had massive structural violations. The violations pertain to construction in excess of the allowed covered area. The 40% area left vacant for back and front courtyard, balconies and other common areas were misused for additional construction and even unauthorised floors. Even the government land was encroached upon in extension work. Residents had been demanding regularisation of some of these need-based changes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-housing-board-extends-deadline-for-removing-violations-101618255422326.html

In the seven days ending April 12, Delhi added an average of 8,104 cases a day, up from the previous high of 7,341 logged on November 14. Just a week ago, this number was 3,548, while two weeks ago, it was 1,904.Read more: Maharashtra, Punjab, C'garh: Govt points out gaps in Covid containment strategyMonday’s fresh spike came even as testing dropped significantly on account of the weekend. The test positivity rate, as a result, shot up to a 142-day high of 12.44%. The positivity rate is a vital parameter used to read the scale of infection spread in a region, and the World Health Organization recommends a number below 5% for two weeks for an infection to be considered under control in a region.On Monday, the city conducted 92,397 tests as against 114,288 the day before.The number of deaths shot up as well on Monday, with 72 fatalities reported of the infections — the most in a day since December 5.

AIIMS chief Randeep Guleria explainsThe surge during the ongoing fourth wave of the pandemic in Delhi has prompted the state government to reintroduce curbs on travel, schools, gatherings, and to enforce a night curfew between 10pm and 5am. The Delhi government on Monday reserved all beds in 14 major private hospitals and six government ones for the treatment of Covid-19 patients in order to ensure the city’s health infrastructure can cope with the additional burden during the present surge.Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday said the situation in Delhi was “very serious”, and asked that people not leave their homes unless it was absolutely necessary.“Looking at the faster spread of the infection, I think it should go down fast too, just like we saw in many other western countries. The peak should happen in the next two weeks,” said Dr Jugal Kishore, head of the department of community medicine at Safdarjung hospital.Hospital beds have been filling up fast in the city, and Kejriwal, after a review meeting, requested residents to get admitted to hospital only if they had severe symptoms.“Held review meeting.

Go n vaccinate if u r eligible,” he tweeted.Dr Kishore echoed this view, and also called for early isolation.“Everyone who is symptomatic should just isolate themselves,” he said.Delhi’s fourth wave of infections comes amid a second nationwide surge, which has surpassed the previous peaks recorded at the national level as well as in several states, HT’s Covid-19 dashboard shows. Experts have attributed the rise in infections in the Capital to poor adherence to Covid-appropriate behaviour such as wearing masks and maintaining social distancing, and to mutant variants.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/covid19-wave-hits-a-new-high-in-delhi-with-11-491-daily-cases-101618252985935.html

13-04-2021||Chandigarh||DSGMC elections: Direct contest on the cards between groups led by Sirsa, GK||Chandigarh There is a direct fight between groups led by outgoing Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (DSGMC) president Manjinder Singh Sirsa and its former head Manjit Singh GK in the April 25 gurdwara body polls in the national capital. Sirsa leads 46 candidates belonging to the Badals-led Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) and GK has fielded candidates under the aegis of his newly launched Jago party which he heads. Also in the fray is group led by Sarna brothers — Paramjit Singh and Harvinder Singh — who too have fielded candidates in all 46 wards. This is the ninth elections of the DSGMC since it came into existence by way an Act of Parliament in 1971. GK had quit the body as president two years ago and Sirsa, who was general secretary of the committee at that time, replaced the former. GK was earlier planning a tie-up with Sarna brothers, who had remained presidents of the gurdwara body from time to time, but the negotiations didn’t work out to seal the tie-up. Sarna brothers have fielded candidates under the aegis of Shiromani Akali Dal Delhi and has the support of former Akal Takht jathedar Bhai Ranjit Singh, who is known for his high-pitched speeches in which he challenges the established leadership in the gurdwara politics. Interestingly, both GK and Sirsa, who are the main protagonists in the upcoming polls, face allegations of mismanaging gurdwara body funds and both are defending themselves in the cases registered against them by the Delhi Police. GK harps on his two terms as DSGMC president from March 2013 to Feb 2017, and from Feb 2017 to Nov 2018, when he represented the SAD (Badal). After that Sirsa took over and remained president until the polls were announced on March 31. GK also has the legacy of his father Jathedar Santokh Singh who helmed the Sikh religio-politics from 1960-81 in the national capital and remained head of the gurdwara body in different capacities. “I have done so much during my tenure of more than five years. The blacklist of the Union home ministry banning travel of a large number Sikhs to India was scraped by the Centre on my intervention. Sajjan Kumar was sent behind bars, 1984 riots memorial was built, Fateh Diwas marking 300 years of Banda Bahadur taking on the Mughals, minority status for DSGMC-run colleges, second language status for Punjabi in Delhi and passports for Afghani Sikhs were some of the works done by the gurdwara body,” said GK. Counting his achievements, Sirsa said the gurdwara body under him supported farmers’ protest and cleared a hi-tech kitchen at gurdwara Bangla Sahib for cooking langar. The gurdwara body served langar to the needy during the pandemic, made available treatment of serious ailments, including dialysis, at DSGMC-run Bala Sahib Hospital, opened a diagnostic centre at gurdwara Bangla Sahib that offers test at a cheaper price, opened a facility for printing Guru Granth Sahib and offered IAS/IPS training.” Paramjit Singh Sarna said, “I think, both GK and Sirsa don’t want to work for the panth but for personal ends. I am sure people of Delhi will understand their designs and vote us back to power.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/dsgmc-elections-direct-contest-on-the-cards-between-groups-led-by-sirsa-gk-101618253978365.html

Heaps of wheat can be seen at the mandis and officials associated with procurement operations said that around 70% of the procured wheat is yet to be lifted, leading space crunch at mandis.With arrivals picking pace with each passing day, farmers are unable to get space to unload their produce at the mandis. Most grains are lying in the open as the sheds at grain markets are turning out to be inadequate.The situation remained worst in Karnal district as out of 2.67 lakh MT wheat procured by the government agencies, only 56,000 MT was lifted so far and over 2 lakh MT is still in the mandis.The situation remains worse in grain markets of Taraori, Indri, Nissing, Assandh in Karnal district; Ladwa, Babain, Ismailabad, Pehowa, Thanesar in Kurukshetra; and Cheeka, Pundri and Kaithal in Kaithal district.As per mandi officials, the government’s decision allowing farmers to bring their produce in mandis without any schedule has led to this situation as most farmers were in a haste to sell their produce.“Most farmers bring their wheat in mandis soon after harvesting as they fear the government may impose restrictions,” said commission agent Mahender Singh, of Karnal.According to Haryana additional chief secretary (food, civil supplies and consumer affairs department) Anurag Rastogi, instructions have been issued to transport managers to speed up lifting and procurement operations in mandis across state.Deputy commissioners have been authorised to add new transport owners on the portal.Now, procurement agencies have the freedom to select a transporter of any of its added vehicles and lift bags of an arhtiya for quick clearing of procured wheat from mandis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/slow-lifting-leads-to-glut-like-situation-at-haryana-mandis-101618253079005.html

Many Imams have advised Muslims to complete Taraweeh at their homes while at some mosques the prayers will be held for a shorter time and with limited persons. As per new guidelines, only five persons are allowed inside religious places at a time and that too with facemasks and social distancing. Before the guideline was issued, Imams of some big and spacious mosques had decided to conduct Taraweeh prayers with 50 to 100 persons while following all Covid protocols. It was decided that after night prayers, Taraweeh would be offered and completed before the starting of night curfew at 9pm. However, with new guidelines now issued, Taraweeh prayers do not seem possible as only five persons are allowed inside mosques, say local Imams. ADM City AK Kanaujia said entry inside religious places will only be allowed as per guidelines issued by the government. No more than five persons will be allowed inside religious places at a time and that too with all precautions and following Covid-19 protocols, he added. In a statement, Mufti Saif-ur-Rehman of Wasiabad Mosque urged members of the Muslim community to offer Taraweeh prayers at home as it was not possible to end the special prayers before 9pm. Those who come to offer regular prayers at mosques should wear facemasks and follow other protocols, he added. Jama Masjid managing committee members Mohd Arshad and Mohd Habeeb said prayers at mosques including special Taraweeh prayers will be offered as per new guidelines issued by the government. The further decision in this connection will be taken after sighting of moon and declaration of starting of Ramzan, they added. SP (City) Dinesh Kumar Singh said religious leaders, priests and Imams will be made aware of the new guidelines issued in connection with the presence of the number of persons at religious places. The guidelines will be strictly implemented in a bid to control the spread of Covid-19 cases, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/prayagraj-imams-urge-ramzan-taraweeh-prayers-to-be-offered-at-homes-101618253018450.html

The café was running with adversely affected revenue generation for the past year and also was leaving the acid attack survivors vulnerable to coronavirus infection, stated Ashish Shukla, the co-founder of Sheroes Hangout Café. “Sheroes Hangout Café was closed during the lockdown in the year 2020 and opened after the lockdown ended. However, the inflow of guests remained affected all through the past year making the revenue model adversely affected,” he said. The café was shifted to a new building last year. “It was getting tough to bear the operational cost which was generated from Café itself. For the last one year, the donations too had fallen, and lesser guests were turning up thus, the decision was taken to shut down the café for at least ten days,” he said. “After ten days we would review the situation and will make the decision accordingly,” said Ashish Shukla who is also director of ‘Chhanv Foundation’, the organization that brought the idea of running the Sheroes Hangout Café as a reality beginning from Agra in the year 2014. The Sheroes Hangout Café is run by acid attack fighters who decided to stand on their own and work at the café and run it on earning it makes. Many VVIP’s and celebrities have visited the café which was inaugurated on December 10, 2014. “However, we would continue with skill management and computer training for these acid attack fighters. The classes for this would continue online,” said Shukla. Another reason for bringing the Sheroes Hangout Café to closure is the reality that half a dozen acid attack fighters running the Café in Agra were also vulnerable to Covid-19 infection more so after going through so many surgeries after an acid attack, these fighters remain prone to the threat of Covid infection. “We are hopeful that the café would not turn the story of past and we aim at reviving activities in better times ahead,” said Ashish Shukla.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/sheroes-hangout-caf-in-taj-city-shut-for-10-days-101618252898349.html

We have reduced 30% syllabus due to the pandemic,” he said.STUDENTS SEEK ONLINE EXAM OPTIONMany students and their parents demanded that students should be given a hoice to take the exam in online mode.Sanjay Deswal, a resident of Asauda village in Jhajjar, said schools had conducted online classes for students and the board should provide online options for exams as well amid rise in Covid cases.Praveen Kumar, of Rohtak, said the board should conduct the exams on time and make proper safety arrangements.“We don’t want to lose a year. We want the board to hold exams on time. If we can visit schools by wearing a mask, why can’t we appear at exam centres for three hours,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/haryana-to-conduct-board-exams-on-time-101618252838368.html
13-04-2021||Gurugram||Gurugram lags behind schedule for monsoon preparedness measures||Monsoon preparedness in the city is yet to pick up pace and is lagging behind schedule, even as neighbouring Delhi and other NCR cities started drain cleaning exercise.MCG officials conceded that if their lack of preparedness measures continues, they are likely to face a tough situation this year as well. “The tendering process has only just started. It takes nearly two months for the process to be completed and work to start on ground. Even the tenders that have been floated only cover a fraction of the city, unless tenders are floated on an emergency basis, we will witness a repeat of 2020,” a senior MCG privy to the matter said.In emergency tenders, work is allocated to contractors within two weeks. This process usually takes anywhere between 45 days and two months.While the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) is still at the initial stage of the tendering process, to select an agency, the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) is nearing completion of the tendering process, with monsoon preparedness work expected to start by the month-end.The GMDA looks after all master drains in the city that carry stormwater or sewerage from more than two residential sectors, while the MCG is responsible for all arterial drains, those passing through a sector internally, in Gurugram.Last year, due to the coronavirus outbreak and subsequent labour shortage as workers returned home due to the lockdown, monsoon preparedness measures were initiated nearly two months later than usual, which resulted in the city being heavily underprepared to deal with waterlogging.The situation was so severe that on two consecutive days in August 2020, seven of the city’s 11 underpasses were inundated along with most major roads. Rainwater also entered houses across the city.MCG’s chief engineer TL Sharma said that the civic body has started the tendering process and expects monsoon preparedness measures to start by May-end. “Tender process usually takes around 6-7 weeks to complete and by May-end, on-ground work such as de-silting and clearing of stormwater and sewerage drains should commence. We have internally set a deadline of June-end to complete the work,” said Sharma, adding that the civic body has started work on cleaning of open drains.Usually, pre-monsoon showers arrive in the city by mid-June.GMDA’s monsoon preparedness measures are slightly better than the MCG, as the authority floated its first set of tenders for cleaning and de-silting drains in February-end. “For most areas, especially waterlogging-prone points, tenders have already been allocated to contractors or nearing it. In six-seven such areas, on-ground work should commence within the next two weeks,” said Rajesh Bansal, superintending engineer, GMDA.Citing an example of GMDA’s better preparedness scenario in comparison to 2020, Bansal said that at this stage last year, only the estimates for GMDA’s flood control room had been compiled, while this year, tenders have already been allocated.Sudhir Rajpal, chief executive officer (CEO), GMDA, stated that the authority identified 20 major points where monsoon preparedness measures need to be initiated on priority and also stated that tenders for most of them were already allocated. “Across all master roads, we are lowering the level of green belts by a foot so that due to the depression, it serves as a catchment area when rainwater collects, instead of overflowing onto the main carriageway. We are also in the process of creating embankments at all waterlogging-prone points located on a slope and channelling the rainwater to the closest water body,” said Rajpal.In January, the GMDA directed its officials to clean all 20-waterlogging points and set a deadline of May 31 to complete the work. Over the past week, north and south municipal corporations in Delhi as well as the Public Works Department (PWD) started cleaning drains alongside roads in the national capital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gurugram-lags-behind-schedule-for-monsoon-preparedness-measures-101618251039471.html
13-04-2021||Delhi||Tihar on high alert after 52 inmates test positive for Covid-19||Delhi’s Tihar jail is on high alert after at least 52 inmates have tested Covid-19 positive, of which 35 are admitted in three different hospitals, senior prison officers said, adding that seven jail officers, including the prison doctor, have also contracted the infection.Until April 6, the jail had only 19 Covid positive prisoners and no jail staff was affected by the viral disease. Prison officers said the infection has spread swiftly as the administration was trying to create isolation spaces inside the country’s most populated prison complex. Currently, the jail has over 20,000 inmates, double its capacity of a little over 10,000.A prison officer who did not wish to be named said, “Three prisoners were critical and had to be admitted to Lok Nayak Hospital; 32 prisoners have been admitted as a precautionary measure at two different hospitals; 17 others are in self isolation in the jail. The seven jail employees are isolating outside.”Read more: 14 private, 6 state govt hospitals dedicated for 100% Covid-19 treatmentA second officer who also spoke on the condition of anonymity said with the jail packed to double its capacity, it was getting difficult to find spaces for prisoners to isolate and ensure social distancing. “Today, more than 20,000 prisoners are in Tihar. The sanctioned capacity is only 10,026. In the last one week, more than 40 cases have been reported. We are finding ways to ensure social distancing, but it is a challenge. We fear the infection will spread more quickly than last time.”Tihar’s director general Sandeep Goel said most of the prisoners were hospitalised as a precautionary measure. “We are creating isolation spaces within the prison. The bi-weekly visit by families from outside has been suspended. Prisoners are being produced in courts only virtually,” he said.Experts such as former Tihar law officer Sunil Gupta and advocate Ajay Verma last week suggested that the administration should not take any chances and release prisoners who have maintained a good conduct and surrendered well on time after being released at the start of the pandemic last year.Gupta had also suggested that the state government may use school buildings, which have open spaces as temporary prisons.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/tihar-on-high-alert-as-covid-cases-cross-50-101618248877567.html

In the past, 25.6 mm rainfall was reported in 24 hours in April 2011. The all-time record, as per IMD, remains that of 51.1 mm rainfall in 24 hours, in April of 1896.Many parts of the city, including Aundh, Baner, Shivajinagar, Lohegaon, Vishrantwadi, Sinhgad Road, Kothrud, Kondhwa, and Yerawada witnessed heavy rains in a short span of time, with gusty winds. Major streets such as Pune-Satara road and NIBM road witnessed waterlogging.India Meteorological Department said Shivajinagar reported 19.04 mm rainfall while Lohegaon reported 0.7 mm rainfall.According to fire brigade department, over 15 incidents of trees falling were reported in the city, mainly at Kothrud, Yerwada and Kondhwa. The maximum temperature was reported at 37 degrees Celsius and the minimum temperature was 22.3 degrees Celsius, according to India Meteorological Department (IMD). As per forecasts made by IMD, Pune may continue to report day temperaturesaround 37 degrees Celsius with night temperatures at 22 degrees Celsius in the next few days.“Cloudy weather along with thunderstorms, lightning and light rains are likely in the city till April 14. Similar weather is expected in Vidarbha, Marathwada, Madhya (central) Maharashtra, Konkan and Goa till April 14,” said an IMD official.The highest maximum temperature in Maharashtra reported, was 40.1 degrees Celsius at Brahmapuri on Monday. The lowest minimum temperature reported was 18.1 degrees Celsius in Mahabaleshwar.Mahabaleshwar reported 8 millimetres of rainfall and Satara reported 0.3 millimetres of rainfall on Monday.Anupam Kashyapi, head of weather forecasting , IMD Pune, said that multiple weather systems are active over the state due to which Pune also received rainfall on Monday, as forecasted by IMD earlier. “There is a trough line from Vidarbha and wind discontinuity which is creating instability through the central part of the state. As a result of this, there will be thundery activity with lightning from April 11, as earlier forecasted. The rainfall on Monday was due to multiple weather systems over the state,” said Kashyapi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/mondays-rainfall-in-pune-second-heaviest-24-hour-spell-in-april-since-2008-101618241497305.html
13-04-2021||Pune||Protest at Pune medical store over Remdesivir shortage||Pune: District collector Rajesh Deshmukh’s order banning over-the-counter sale of anti-viral drug Remdesivir has failed to stop relatives and friends of Covid patients from crowding medical shops as hospitals claim they still have not received the stock. The order issued by Deshmukh on Saturday states that the anti-viral drug would be available only at Covid hospitals. Crowd was seen in front of medical stores, including Central Drugs store at Shukrawar peth, on Monday. Many had to return frustrated, leading to anger that resulted in protest during the morning. By evening, the administration claimed that Pune has received 6,000 doses of Remdesivir and it is distributed among hospitals as per requirements of patients. Dinesh Khivasara, assistant commissioner, Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said, “We have distributed 6,000 doses of Remdesivir received on Monday. Each district in Maharashtra gets its share from the state according to hospitalised patients. Pune gets about 13-14% of the injections which the state gets.” During the day, some hospitals claimed they have enough stock for the next few days, but relatives of patients admitted in small hospitals were left in the lurch. Small medical treatment facilities and even PMC’s Covid care centres continued to prescribe drugs and asked the relatives to get the injection from outside, despite the collector’s order on April 10 asking hospitals to procure the drugs from the administration instead of asking the relatives to get the drugs. Resident Madhuri Karanjkar was waiting in queue in front of Central Drug store Gadikhana since 6 am as her father-in-law was admitted to the Baner Covid centre. She said, “My father-in-law is admitted at a centre and the hospital made him call us and asked us to get the drug. I came here early morning and at around 10 am they put out a notice saying that no drugs would be provided here. There are only two helplines for the entire district and they are engaged all the time.” Another woman who was also protesting at the drug store due to the drug unavailability said, “There are no drugs available in small hospitals. One of my relative is admitted in a 15-bed hospital and they asked us to get the drug from outside since they do not have it. Major hospitals are getting the stock.” After waiting outside the drug store for hours, the residents staged a protest and left the store without getting the injections. At PMC-run COEP jumbo care centre, patients were asked to get it from outside. After one such patient’s relative was found to be looking for the drug outside the centre, Dr Shreyansh Kapale, director of Medbros, the agency that runs the centre said, “We have not asked the patient’s relatives, but they sometimes volunteer to get it because of their own concerns. Since the relatives need the prescription to get the drugs, so we give them.” Dr Nitin Lohakare, medical director of Mahesh Smruti multi-speciality hospital said, “We are a 50-bed Covid hospital where we have 48 positive patients and almost 45 patients need Remdesivir. However, we have not yet got any stock of the injection yet. Remdesivir is a potent drug for those with high grade fever and also hypoxia for those with comorbidities.” Dr Avinash Bhondwe, Indian Medical Association (IMA) president for Maharashtra said, “The government is unnecessarily blaming doctors for the injection shortage by claiming that the latter are prescribing it without assessment. The drug has been proven to work across the country. It has to be given at the earlier stage for patients with mild and moderate symptoms. It has also proven to work in other viral epidemics. It basically prevents the replication of the virus and spread of the diseases which stops the patients from becoming serious. While earlier doctors were prescribing about 10 doses for each patient, now we prescribe only 6 doses as per protocol, which is two doses on day one and then four injections for the next four days. The drug works on patients which diagnosis of a chest computed tomography (CT) score of seven or more and also when the viral load is not high. If the patient is severe then the drug will not work. The shortage is because of the drastic rise in demand which could not be met. The health minister has assured that there would be ample supply of the drug after April 15.” A senior FDA official said, “The shortage is in private hospitals because about 78% of the hospitalised patients are being prescribed Remdesivir which was earlier about 10-15%. The administration has also formed a team to ensure that the drug is prescribed appropriately. We are hoping to get a fresh stock again on Tuesday but are yet to know the numbers.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/protest-at-medical-store-over-remdesivir-shortage-pune-gets-6k-doses-in-the-evening-101618239397240.html
13-04-2021||Chandigarh||Amarjeet Singh Sidhu elected Mohali mayor||Amarjeet Singh Sidhu, 48, a first-time councillor and the brother of Punjab health minister Balbir Singh Sidhu, was elected the mayor of Mohali on Monday morning. Amrik Singh Somal, a two-time councillor who defeated former mayor and Azad group head Kulwant Singh, was elected the senior deputy mayor while three-time councillor Kuljeet Singh Bedi was elected the deputy mayor during the first meeting of the new General House of the municipal corporation.Though the mayor’s term is for five years, the three have been elected for just two-and-a-half years, said Balbir Singh Sidhu. “We have declared that Rishiv Jain will be the mayor after two-and-a-half years, while Narpinder Singh Rangi will be the senior deputy mayor. We will take the decision on the deputy mayor later,” he said, adding that it is an attempt to maintain balance within the party and the names have been decided by the high command. Earlier, Rishiv Jain, who is a three-time councillor and former senior deputy mayor, and his wife Raj Rani Jain, a four-time councillor, boycotted the election and left after taking the oath. They alleged the Congress had failed to follow the seniority principle while selecting its mayoral candidate. Punjab cabinet minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa was present as an observer in the meeting. In the civic body elections held for 50 wards in February, the Congress won 37 seats, while the Azad Group got 10 and three went to Independents. From liquor, real estate business to politics Amarjeet, a political greenhorn, won from ward number 10. Popularly known as Jeeti Sidhu, he completed Class 12 from a local school and is looking after his family’s liquor and real estate business in Mohali. He is also a director of the SAS Nagar Central Cooperative Bank Limited. Amarjeet ran into trouble a decade ago after his name figured in a murder case following a group clash in Balongi in 2010. The case was later handed over to the Central Bureau of Investigation, and the trial is still on. Opposition councillors boycott elections All the opposition councillors boycotted the meeting stating that the elections are unconstitutional. In a sign of unity, they entered the House together and soon after taking oath, they walked out. Independent councillor Manjit Singh Sethi said though the state government has reserved 50% seats for women, not a single mayoral post was given to women. Stating that Amarjeet is a “controversial” person already named in a murder FIR, Sethi said: “How can the city develop under a tainted person?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/amarjeet-singh-sidhu-elected-mohali-mayor-101618208016522.html
13-04-2021||World||US-led troops to leave Afghanistan by September 11||US-led international forces will leave Afghanistan before September 11, the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks that brought them to the country, said a senior Biden administration official on Tuesday.The US will leave behind troops only to protect its diplomats, and not for counterinsurgency or training purposes as had been considered. The senior official said the size of this residual presence will be decided in consultation with coalition partners.US-led forces were supposed to have left Afghanistan by May 1, according to the terms of an agreement that the Trump administration had signed with the Taliban.President Joe Biden, who is expected to announce the new timeline on Wednesday, had expressed the inability to comply with the May 1 deadline. “We are not staying for a long time. We will leave,” Biden had said. “The question is when we leave.” The US currently has 2,500-3,500 troops in Afghanistan, with around 8,500 soldiers of coalition partners.As a candidate for the White House, Biden had indicated he supported leaving behind a residual force for counterinsurgency and training Afghan forces. But now the troops to be left behind will be meant only for the security of diplomats, which, the US official said, was the topmost priority.The official also said the drawdown will not be condition-based, which would end up keeping US forces in the country longer. The US will continue to monitor al-Qaeda and other terrorist forces in the country from its military presence in the region.The official said the Taliban will be on notice to not attack the US and international forces in the intervening months to the September 11 exit.The drawdown will start before May 1 and will be over before September 11, which is the outer limit, the official said, adding that US forces could leave much earlier than that.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/usled-troops-to-leave-afghanistan-by-september-11-101618336605283.html
13-04-2021||World||US recommends pause on J&J Covid-19 vaccine. What we know so far||The US Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on Tuesday recommended a “pause” in the use of the Johnson and Johnson (J&J) Covid-19 vaccine “out of an abundance of caution” to probe reports of potentially dangerous blood clots. Six cases of blood clots have been reported among people vaccinated with Johnson and Johnson (J&J) Covid-19 vaccine in the US, reports said.Today FDA and @CDCgov issued a statement regarding the Johnson & Johnson #COVID19 vaccine. We are recommending a pause in the use of this vaccine out of an abundance of caution.What we know about the vaccine so far:FDA and the CDC will review the data of the development of a rare and severe type of blood clot in six individuals after they received the vaccine. The adverse effects cases reported in the US appear to be extremely rare and the treatment of this specific type of blood clot is different from the treatment that might typically be administered, said the FDA.The six individuals who reported the adverse effects from the vaccine are women aged between 18 to 48 years. The regulators on the treatment of the effects said, reported CNBC, heparin, which is usually used to treat such symptoms will be dangerous in this case.Johnson and Johnson denied any relation of the symptoms with its vaccine. The company in a statement said, “No clear causal relationship” has been identified between the blood clots and the shot. It is working closely with the regulators to review the data, CNBC quoted J&J as saying.More than 6.8 million individuals have been administered the vaccine, as of Monday, the FDA informed.Also Read | US President Joe Biden to pull troops from Afghanistan by September 11: ReportThe regulators have recommended the pause till the process of investigation is not completed. “CDC will convene a meeting of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) on Wednesday to further review these cases and assess their potential significance. FDA will review that analysis as it also investigates these cases,” it said.Prior to the reports of blood clots in individuals receiving the J&J vaccine, the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine, which is not in use in the US, reported cases of similar symptoms. The European Medical Agency concluded that unusual blood clots with low platelet count be listed as "very rare side effects" of the AstraZeneca vaccine.FDA issued emergency use authorization for single-dose Covid-19 vaccine, developed by the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson, to prevent the disease in individuals aged 18 and above in February. The administration of the vaccine in a single dose makes it unique from others.“The J&J vaccine went into Phase III trials as a one-dose vaccine because earlier phase trials had shown strong immune responses after just one dose,” said UC San Francisco infectious disease expert Monica Gandhi in March.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-recommends-pause-on-j-j-covid-19-vaccine-what-we-know-so-far-101618333452588.html
13-04-2021||World||US President Joe Biden to pull troops from Afghanistan by September 11: Report||President Joe Biden has decided to withdraw US troops from Afghanistan by Sept. 11, 2021, 20 years to the day after al Qaeda's attacks triggered America's longest war, three sources familiar with the decision told Reuters.However, the withdrawal would be based on certain security and human rights guarantees, the sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity ahead of the formalization of the decision. The sources did not provide further details.US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin are expected to brief the decision to NATO allies in Brussels on Wednesday. Biden may also publicly announce his decision, the sources said.Biden's decision, should it be confirmed, would miss a May 1 deadline for withdrawal agreed with Taliban insurgents by his predecessor Donald Trump's administration. In a statement last month, the Taliban threatened to resume hostilities against foreign troops in Afghanistan if they did not meet the May 1 deadline.But it would still set a near-term date with withdrawal, potentially allaying Taliban concerns that Biden would drag out the process.The May 1 deadline had already started to appear less and less likely in recent weeks, given the lack of preparations on the ground to ensure it could be done in a safe and responsible way. US officials have also blamed the Taliban for failing to live up to commitments to reduce violence and some have warned about persistent Taliban links to al Qaeda.It was those ties that triggered US military intervention in 2001 following al Qaeda's Sept. 11 attacks on New York and Washington because the Taliban had harbored al Qaeda leaders.Thousands of American and allied troops have died in fighting in Afghanistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-president-joe-biden-to-pull-troops-from-afghanistan-by-september-11-report-101618329146126.html
13-04-2021||World||Iran to enrich uranium to highest level ever: Official||Iran will begin enriching uranium to 60purity, higher than the programme ever has before, after an attack on its Natanz nuclear facility, an Iranian nuclear negotiator said Tuesday.Abbas Araghchi's comment, quoted by the state-run IRNA news agency, came after Iran's foreign minister warned that the weekend assault could hurt ongoing negotiations over its tattered atomic deal with world powers.Those talks are aimed at finding a way for the United States to re-enter the agreement, the goal of which is to limit Iran's enrichment of uranium in exchange relief on sanctions.Iran had been enriching up to 20 per cent. That is a short technical step to weapons-grade levels.The International Atomic Energy Agency did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Press TV, the Iranian state television's English-language arm, separately said that the IAEA had been informed of the move. It said the enrichment would begin as of Wednesday.The broadcaster also quoted the negotiator as saying Iran would introduce another 1,000 centrifuges at Natanz, without elaborating.Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei had threatened to go to 60 per cent enrichment in February if the country needed.“We are determined to develop our nuclear capabilities in line with the needs of the country,” Khamenei said then, according to a transcript of his speech published by his website. “For this reason, Iran's enrichment will not be limited to 20 per cent, and we will take whatever action is necessary for the country.”Iran previously had said it could use uranium enriched up to 60 per cent for nuclear-powered ships. The Islamic Republic currently has no such ships in its navy.Details remained scarce about the weekend attack at Natanz. The event was initially described only as a blackout in the electrical grid feeding above-ground workshops and underground enrichment halls — but later Iranian officials began referring to it as an attack.The U.S. has insisted it had nothing to do with Sunday's sabotage. Instead, Israel is widely believed to have carried out the assault that damaged centrifuges, though it has not claimed it.But earlier Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif still issued a warning to Washington.“Americans should know that neither sanctions nor sabotage actions would provide them with an instrument for talks," Zarif said in Tehran alongside visiting Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. “They should know that these actions would only make the situation difficult for them.”Zarif separately renewed his earlier warning to Israel over the sabotage, saying that if Iran determines its archenemy was behind it, "then Israel will get its response and will see what a stupid thing it has done.”Kayhan, the hard-line Tehran newspaper, urged Iran to "walk out of the Vienna talks, suspend all nuclear commitments, retaliate against Israel and identify and dismantle the domestic infiltration network behind the sabotage.”“Despite evidence that shows the role of the U.S. as main instigator of nuclear sabotage against Iran, unfortunately some statesmen, by purging the US of responsibility, (aid) Washington's crimes against the people of Iran,” the paper said in Tuesday's editions.While Kayhan is a small-circulation newspaper, its editor-in-chief, Hossein Shariatmadari, was appointed by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and has been described as an adviser to him in the past.Such a walkout remains unlikely as the administration of President Hassan Rouhani, whose main diplomatic achievement was the 2015 accord, hopes to get the U.S. to rejoin it and provide desperately needed sanctions relief. However, pressure does appear to be growing within Iran's theocracy over how to respond to the attack.The talks in Vienna — among Iran, world powers still in the deal and the U.S. — are aimed at reviving America's role in the agreement that former President Donald Trump abandoned and lifting the sanctions he imposed.Iran, in turn, would return to the limits set by the deal and dilute its growing stockpile of uranium — some of which has been enriched up to a short step away from weapons-grade levels.Iran insists its nuclear program is peaceful, though the West and the International Atomic Energy Agency say Tehran had an organized military nuclear program up until the end of 2003. However, the deal prevents it from having enough of a uranium stockpile to be able to pursue a nuclear weapon.Rouhani met later Tuesday with Lavrov and stressed the importance of all parties returning to the deal. Russia is a member of the nuclear deal."We are neither ready to accept less than that, nor are we after achieving more than that,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-to-enrich-uranium-to-highest-level-ever-official-101618322741412.html
13-04-2021||World||China warns of actions against Japan's move to release radioactive water from Fukushima nuclear power plant into sea||China on Tuesday objected to Japan's move to release treated radioactive water from the crippled Fukushima No. 1 nuclear power plant into the sea, warning Tokyo that "it reserves the right to make further reactions".Japan decided on Tuesday to release treated radioactive water from crippled Fukushima No. 1 nuclear power plant into the sea, having assessed there will be no negative impact on human health or the environment despite concerns from local fishermen and neighbouring countries, Japan Times reported.Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga met with members of his Cabinet to formalise the decision, which comes a decade after a massive earthquake and tsunami triggered a triple meltdown in March 2011.While the US-backed Japan’s move, it drew sharp reactions from neighbouring China and South Korea."As a close neighbour and stakeholder, the Chinese side expresses grave concern over this," the Chinese Foreign Ministry said in a statement."The Fukushima nuclear accident is one of the most serious in world history. The leak of large amounts of radioactive materials has had far-reaching implications on the marine environment, food safety and human health," it said.It said a review report by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) expert team points out that "if the wastewater containing tritium from the Fukushima nuclear plant is discharged into the sea, it will affect the marine environment and people's health of neighbouring countries and that the treated wastewater needs to be further purified to remove other radionuclides”.The Chinese Foreign Ministry also quoted a report by the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR) which believes that the impact of the wastewater on the marine ecological environment requires continued monitoring.The Japanese government "should re-evaluate the issue and refrain from wantonly discharging the wastewater before reaching consensus with all stakeholders and the IAEA through full consultations”, the statement said."China will continue to watch closely the developments of the matter together with the international community and reserves the right to make further reactions," it said.China’s state-run CGTN TV reported that South Korea too expressed 'strong regret' after Suga's announcement.Koo Yoon-cheol, head of South Korea's Office for Government Policy Coordination, said that the government will take every necessary measure in line with the principle of keeping its people safe from the contaminated water from the Fukushima nuclear plant.South Korea on Tuesday summoned Japanese Ambassador Koichi Aiboshi over Tokyo's decision to release contaminated water from the Fukushima nuclear plant, the YTN broadcaster reported.However, the US has defended the Japanese government’s decision, saying the release of treated water is an 'acceptable approach'.Japanese government has taken the decision "in close coordination" with the IAEA "including radiation monitoring, remediation, waste management, and decommissioning," said a statement by the US."The US is aware that the GOJ (Government of Japan) examined several options related to the management of the treated water currently being stored onsite at the Fukushima Daiichi site."In this unique and challenging situation, Japan has weighed the options and effects, has been transparent about its decision, and appears to have adopted an approach in accordance with globally accepted nuclear safety standards," it said."We look forward to the GOJ’s continued coordination and communication as it monitors the effectiveness of this approach," it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-warns-of-actions-against-japan-s-move-to-release-radioactive-water-from-fukushima-nuclear-power-plant-into-sea-101618318223572.html

The island’s defence ministry said it scrambled its own jets to warn and monitor the mainland aircraft.China considers Taiwan as a “core” territorial issue and has been aggressively using the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) to show off military strength around the island of about 23 million people.Beijing has over the years warned countries including India against establishing official ties with Taipei - and instead support the “one China policy” - and has never ruled out reuniting Taiwan using military power.The Chinese foreign ministry on Tuesday continued its aggressive posturing against the US on Taiwan, one of the primary friction points between the two countries.Spokesperson Zhao Lijian told reporters that China has lodged “stern representations” with the US over the guidelines. China, Zhao said, urges the US “not to play with fire on the Taiwan issue, immediately stop any form of US-Taiwan official contacts, cautiously and appropriately handle the matter, and not send wrong signals to Taiwan independence forces so as not to subversively influence and damage Sino-US relations and peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait”.China’s latest warning comes after US secretary of state Antony Blinken said Washington is concerned by Beijing’s “increasingly aggressive actions” directed at Taiwan and remains committed to ensuring peace and stability in the western Pacific region.“What we’ve seen, and what is of real concern to us, is increasingly aggressive actions by the government in Beijing directed at Taiwan,” Blinken said during an interview to NBC.The Joe Biden administration is committed to ensuring that Taiwan has the ability to defend itself, Blinken added. “It would be a serious mistake for anyone to try to change the existing status quo by force,” he said.Only 15 countries officially recognise Taiwan, and do not have diplomatic ties with Beijing.President Tsai Ing-wen has maintained that Taiwan is an independent country called the Republic of China - which is its formal name - and that she will defend its freedom and security.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dont-play-with-fire-china-tells-us-after-chinese-jets-swarm-taiwan-border-101618318721851.html

The agencies have drawn up a new guidance aimed "to reduce the risk of transmission of Covid-19 and other zoonoses in traditional food markets". It warned that 'wet markets', such as the one in Wuhan which is linked to the raging coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic, pose significant problems when they allow the sale and slaughter of live wild animals in areas open to the public.The agencies that have joined WHO in drawing up the fresh documentation are the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). "WHO, OIE and UNEP call on all national competent authorities to suspend the trade in live caught wild animals of mammalian species for food or breeding and close sections of food markets selling live caught wild animals of mammalian species as an emergency measure unless demonstrable effective regulations and adequate risk assessment are in place," the document reads.It recalled that the SARS-CoV-2 virus, responsible for the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, had links to a wholesale traditional food market in the Chinese city of Wuhan, with many of the initial patients stall owners, market employees, or regular visitors to the market. Not just the present pandemic, some of the earliest known cases of epidemic outbreaks within the coronavirus family -- the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2012 -- also had links to zoonotic viruses.Most emerging infectious diseases, such as the Lassa fever, Marburg haemorraghic fever, Nipah viral infections and other viral diseases also have viral diseases also have wildlife origins, the agencies said. Research indicates that there is "strong association" between the marketing and sale of live wild animals and the emergence of novel zoonotic pathogens, the document notes, adding, "Animals, particularly wild animals, are reported to be the source of more than 70% of all emerging infectious diseases in humans, many of which are caused by novel viruses."The agencies called for improved hygiene standards in traditional food markets and tougher regulations to control the farming and sale of wild animals heading to markets for human consumption. This was a necessary to reduce the risk of transmitting diseases from animals, and between people, the documentation notes.Click here for the complete interim guidance issued by WHO, the OIE, and the UN environment programme for reducing reducing public health risks associated with the sale of live wild animals of mammalian species in traditional food markets.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/over-70-of-emerging-diseases-may-come-from-wild-animals-warns-who-101618310911314.html

More than 6.8 million doses of the J&J vaccine have been administered in the U.S.U.S. federal distribution channels, including mass vaccination sites, will pause the use of the J&J shot, and states and other providers are expected to follow.CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices will meet Wednesday to discuss the cases and the FDA has also launched an investigation of the cases.“Until that process is complete, we are recommending a pause in the use of this vaccine out of an abundance of caution,” Dr. Anne Schuchat, Principal Deputy Director of the CDC and Dr. Peter Marks, director of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research said in a joint statement.

States must not allow the deadly mistakes of the past in Syria and elsewhere to be repeated," Bachelet said.Bachelet referred to the reported killing of 82 people in the central town of Bago last week and she said targeted sanctions, as imposed by some Western countries, were not enough.She called for "immediate, decisive and impactful measures to push Myanmar’s military leadership into halting its campaign of repression and slaughter".Activists keen to maintain the momentum of their campaign against the military have called for protests throughout the holiday, which runs until Saturday.This was the second year in a row the new year festivities were called off. Last year, it was because of the novel coronavirus."We cannot enjoy this year. We will celebrate once we get democracy," said another Twitter user, Su Su Soe.The military says it had to overthrow Suu Kyi's government because a November election again won by her National League for Democracy was rigged. The election commission dismissed the accusation.Suu Kyi, 75, who has led Myanmar's struggle against military rule for decades and who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991, has been detained since the coup and charged with various offences. These include violating a colonial-era official secrets act that alone could see her jailed for 14 years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-protesters-cancel-new-year-festivities-un-urges-end-to-slaughter-101618311094462.html
13-04-2021||World||Novavax says supply shortages delaying full-speed production of its Covid-19 vaccine||Novavax Inc has pushed back the timeline for hitting its production target of 150 million Covid-19 vaccine doses per month until the third quarter due to supply shortages including bags used to grow cells, a company spokeswoman told Reuters.Novavax executives had previously said full-scale vaccine production could be achieved by mid-year. The company told Reuters in January it expected to reach full production capacity by May or June."We said during our earnings call that we expect all capacity being online by around mid-year. We’re continuing to refine that timing as we get closer, which now leads us to think we’re online/at full capacity by Q3," Novavax communications director Amy Speak said by email on Monday."There are some supply shortages that come and go that have contributed to the revision in timing," she added. "These have included things like the bioreactor bags and filters."Novavax could receive UK regulatory authorization for its vaccine as early as this month after releasing impressive UK trial data. It anticipates clearance in the United States could come as early as May after soon-to-be released data from its US vaccine trial are reviewed by regulators.The Maryland-based company is one of several Covid-19 vaccine makers that have had to push back production timelines due to industrywide shortages of raw materials and difficulties getting plants up and running.Reuters reported last month that Novavax had delayed a planned deal to ship at least 100 million doses of its two-shot vaccine to the European Union, in part because of supply challenges.In a Saturday interview with the Guardian, Novavax Chief Executive Stan Erck said the company has faced difficulties sourcing key production materials including single-use bags used to grow vaccine cells."Single-use bags are facing critical shortages and delays," said Mark Womack, chief business officer of AGC Biologics, a contract manufacturer that is producing materials used in Novavax's vaccine.Data released in March from the UK trial showed the vaccine to be highly effective against the original strain of the novel coronavirus as well as the more contagious and deadly variant first discovered in Britain and now rampant in Europe and the United States. The data also suggests the shot provides some protection against a highly concerning variant that emerged in South Africa, which some drugmakers have said may require a booster shot to address.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/novavax-says-supply-shortages-delaying-full-speed-production-of-its-covid-19-vaccine-101618310427482.html
13-04-2021||World||Australia rules out adding Johnson & Johnson Covid-19 vaccine to inoculation plan||The Australian government said Tuesday it had decided against buying the single-dose Johnson & Johnson coronavirus vaccine and identified a second case of a rare blood clot likely linked to the AstraZeneca shot.The government had been in talks with the New Jersey-based pharmaceutical giant, which had asked the Australian regulator, Therapeutic Goods Administration, for provisional registration.But Health Minister Greg Hunt ruled out a J&J contract because its vaccine was similar to the AstraZeneca product, which Australia had already contracted for 53.8 million doses.Hunt said the government was following the advice of Australia's scientific and technical advisory group.“J&J is another viral vector vaccine and we have no advice recommending, at this point, that the government purchase any additional viral vector vaccine,” Hunt told reporters. "That's not a reflection, that's simply an observation.”Australia has been relatively successful in containing the spread of the virus, but criticism is mounting over the pace of its vaccination rollout.Australia had planned to rely on Australian-manufactured AstraZeneca to reach a target of delivering at least one dose of vaccine to all eligible adults among a population of 26 million by October.But the government abandoned that target after it advised last week that Pfizer was now the preferred option for people under 50 years because of a potential risk of rare blood clots linked to AstraZeneca.A man in Victoria state who received an AstraZeneca injection on March 22 had to be hospitalized with blood clots. A second case was reported Tuesday of a woman who was inoculated in Western Australia state and hospitalized in Darwin, regulator said in a statement.With 700,000 AstraZeneca doses injected in Australia since early March, the two cases equate to a clotting frequency of 1-in-350,000, the regulator said. British authorities say the risk of such blood clots is 1-in-250,000 in that country.The government has doubled its Pfizer order to 40 million doses and Hunt said delivery of the additional 20 million doses was expected in the last three months of 2021.“That would mean a significant sprint for those that hadn't been vaccinated by then,” Hunt said, referring to the government's hope to have the population inoculated this year.Australia had hoped to administer 4 million doses of the two vaccines by the end March, but had only injected 1.2 million doses by Monday.An 80-year-old Australian man on Monday became the first Covid-19 fatality in Australia this year and the 910th since the pandemic began.The man had been living in the Philippines where he became infected. He tested positive in hotel quarantine as a returned traveller and died in a Brisbane hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australia-rules-out-adding-johnson-johnson-covid-19-vaccine-to-inoculation-plan-101618309611633.html
13-04-2021||World||Climate lies are Facebook’s new target in the misinformation war||In the midst of the heated US presidential race last summer, with hypercharged scrutiny of partisan propaganda on social media, Facebook Inc. Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg received a letter from a group of US senators led by Massachusetts Democrat Elizabeth Warren that had nothing to do with elections. They were angry about a year-old piece of climate news.A Washington Examiner article shared on Facebook in 2019 had denounced climate models, which are widely used by scientists around the world to measure and predict the impacts of warmer temperatures. Science Feedback, an outside organization Facebook works with on fact-checking, had labeled the story false. A review by five scientists found the story “highly misleading” because of “false factual assertions” and accused the authors of “cherry-picking datasets.” The conclusion meant Facebook posts linking to the story would now be saddled with a label saying it had been disputed. But then Facebook said because the article was designated as an op-ed, it was exempt from fact checks under the company’s policies. The “false” label was removed. Warren’s letter called the op-ed policy a “massive loophole.” Facebook’s policies on climate lies “represents another unfortunate example of Facebook’s refusal to fully combat the deliberate spread of misinformation,” she added.Climate change has emerged as a key priority in Facebook’s quest to stomp out misinformation, a complicated effort that involves policing user posts while simultaneously defending free speech. In the past few months the company has started fighting climate misinformation with some of the same strategies used to battle Covid‑19 myths and election falsehoods—a sign of the topic’s growing importance internally. But Facebook’s misinformation policies have also left climate activists frustrated.Zuckerberg got another letter last month, this time from 13 environmental groups including the Union of Concerned Scientists and Greenpeace, asking the company to commit to monitoring climate disinformation and releasing reports, among other things. “Climate change disinformation is spreading rapidly across Facebook’s social media platform, threatening the ability of citizens and policymakers to fight the climate crisis,” the groups wrote.Unlike elections, which have shorter timelines, climate change is a long-term problem with no definitive ending. That means Facebook doesn’t consider lies about the climate an “imminent” threat of real-world harm, which is the threshold the company uses to determine whether a post containing misinformation should be removed from the service entirely. “It is an immediate threat, and the fact that they don’t see that makes me mad,” says Naomi Oreskes, a professor of the history of science at Harvard and the co-author of Merchants of Doubt, a book about climate science being deliberately obscured. “We have enormous evidence now that many storms, floods, hurricanes, cyclones have been made worse by climate change.”At a congressional hearing last month, Zuckerberg admitted that climate misinformation is “a big issue.” A Facebook spokesman says climate change misinformation accounts for a very low percentage of total misinformation on the service but declined to share figures. Experts who follow climate misinformation have had a tough time quantifying its presence on Facebook given a lack of access to private groups and messages, but they’ve seen how small lies can spread quickly.When millions of Texans lost power in February, Facebook failed to label a number of posts falsely claiming that “wind turbine failures were a leading cause of blackouts,” according to Avaaz, a nonprofit group that studied the issue. The top 10 posts promoting those claims, none of which received fact check labels, garnered an estimated 15.8 million views, Avaaz found.“Even if it seems like it’s a small number of actors sometimes, the scale of Facebook’s algorithm and its reach as the world’s information highway right now means that millions of people will be impacted by what they see on that platform,” says Fadi Quran, a campaign director at Avaaz.An outside climate watchdog called InfluenceMap found in October 2020 that dozens of climate denial ads slipped through the social network’s filters and garnered 8 million views. The ads were targeted to older users in more rural, Republican-leaning states, making them more impactful, says Dylan Tanner, executive director of InfluenceMap. “The power of that targeting makes that 8 million even more powerful,” he says. A Facebook search in March by Bloomberg Green found a handful of groups, with thousands of members, with names such as “Man Made Global Warming is a HOAX” and “Climate Crisis? There is NO Climate Crisis!”A Facebook spokesman says “we take action against pages, groups, and accounts that repeatedly share false claims.” When fact-checkers rate content as false, he says, “we add a warning label and reduce its distribution.” Groups that repeatedly share misinformation aren’t removed, but are no longer recommended by Facebook’s algorithm, he adds.Climate misinformation has been around for decades, with lobbying efforts and marketing by Big Oil as far back as the 1980s, but Oreskes says social media may be making it worse. A regular public speaker on climate issues, she’s noticed in recent years that attendees’ questions often mirror online memes. “When it spreads to social media it’s even more pernicious,” Oreskes says, “because now you’re hearing it from a friend or relative.”Just as Facebook can exacerbate a false narrative, it also has the ability to change it entirely. With almost 2.8 billion users globally, the social network has an opportunity with climate change that it hasn’t had with other topics—a chance to educate millions of people without the pressure of a looming election or public health crisis.Facebook’s efforts to fight climate-related misinformation picked up last year when it called a handful of experts to ask for help. That led the company to create the Climate Science Information Center, a dedicated space on the service with scientist-approved information. The center appears as the top search result when users query climate-related terms, like “global warming” or “greenhouse gases.” Users can see charts mapping the average annual temperature of their state, or click to read facts about declining polar bear populations or excess carbon dioxide.The data are meant to counter common misconceptions that people share on Facebook, including claims that the concept of climate change is widely disputed among scientists (not true), or that climbing temperatures are not the result of human activity (also false). Facebook is already adding links to the center on user posts about climate change for some in the UK, and could soon expand those labels to other countries.Widespread labeling posts is the same approach Facebook used for the 2020 US election and for Covid‑19 vaccine information. It’s a strategy that aligns with one of Zuckerberg’s key beliefs: The best way to fight misinformation is with more information.“There has long been this kind of purity default that we should treat all of this as ‘we are just a platform for the free expression of ideas,’” says Anthony Leiserowitz, the founder and director of the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication, who advised Facebook on its climate hub and was not paid by the company. “Maybe through force, maybe through argument inside, they are increasingly recognizing that’s just not an adequate answer to the challenges they are facing.”Experts say the info center is a good effort but only a start. Oreskes still thinks Facebook should remove climate misinformation entirely. Quran wants Facebook to retroactively notify people if they’ve previously seen misinformation by putting alerts in their feed. “If the goal is addressing misinformation, just providing facts is not an adequate solution,” says John Cook, a research fellow at the Climate Change Communication Research Hub at Monash University in Melbourne.  He also consulted on Facebook’s effort without pay. “But I think they recognize that themselves.”There’s reason to suspect Facebook’s recent efforts may signal more changes to come. Climate change is an issue of great importance to the company’s employees, according to internal surveys, and top executives agree. Zuckerberg once said stopping climate change was “one of the most important challenges of our generation,” and Donald Trump’s decision to pull out of the Paris Agreement marked one of the few times Zuckerberg publicly criticized the former president.Chris Cox, the social network’s longtime head of product and one of its most powerful executives, is also a climate advocate. He advised and invested in multiple climate-related startups during a brief year away from Facebook. Cox’s return in May 2020 added “a huge amount of momentum” to some of the company’s climate-related products, says Edward Palmieri, Facebook’s director of sustainability. “The Climate Science Information Center is something that we had been thinking about, but Chris was able to help us move even faster and get even more resources.”If the company manages to effectively combat climate misinformation, it could be a major step toward educating millions of people. A failure to stop the lies from spreading, on the other hand, could be devastating. “[It’s] not just an important opportunity, but responsibility to give their users access to quality information,” Leiserowitz says. “To go to an old saying: You never get a second chance to make a first impression.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/climate-lies-are-facebook-s-new-target-in-the-misinformation-war-101618308403761.html
13-04-2021||World||Russia blames US, other NATO nations for turning Ukraine into 'powder keg'||Moscow on Tuesday accused the United States and other NATO countries of turning Ukraine into a "powder keg," after the West sounded the alarm over Russian soldiers massing on the border."The United States and other NATO countries are deliberately turning Ukraine into a powder keg," Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov was quoted as saying by Russian news agencies, adding that countries were increasing their arms supplies to Ukraine.Clashes between Ukrainian forces and Moscow-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine have escalated in recent weeks, upending a ceasefire brokered last year.Following an uptick in violence, Russia has built up troops along the border, raising fears of a major escalation in the long-running conflict in Ukraine's mainly Russian-speaking east."If there is any aggravation, we of course will do everything to ensure our security and the safety of our citizens, wherever they are," Ryabkov said."But Kiev and its allies in the West will be entirely responsible for the consequences of a hypothetical exacerbation," he added.On Tuesday morning, a Ukrainian soldier was killed and two more injured near the village of Mayorske some 35 kilometres (21 miles) north of the separatist stronghold Donetsk when a drone dropped grenades on the positions of Kiev's troops, the military said.The latest casualty brought the number of Ukrainian troops killed since the start of the year to 29, compared to 50 in all of 2020.Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba was in Brussels on Tuesday, where he met with NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg.Kuleba was also set to meet with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken in Brussels later Tuesday.Ahead of the visit he said he wanted to discuss Western support for Ukraine."Already now we need to talk about practical support that Ukraine can get in case of a large-scale armed escalation," Kuleba said in televised remarks late Monday.The Kremlin, which has not denied the troop movements along the border, has said it is not planning to go to war with Ukraine, but also added that it "will not remain indifferent" to the fate of Russian speakers in the east||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-blames-us-other-nato-nations-for-turning-ukraine-into-powder-keg-101618308366520.html
13-04-2021||World||Hong Kong activist Joshua Wong jailed for 4 months for 2019 protest||Joshua Wong, one of Hong Kong’s most prominent democracy activists and among 47 people charged under a national security law, was sentenced to four months in jail on Tuesday for unauthorized assembly and violating an anti-mask law.Wong, 24, had pleaded guilty to both charges, including taking part in and using a facial covering at an unauthorized assembly in October 2019 during the height of anti-government protests, the court heard.He had faced a maximum possible sentence of three years in jail. The sentence will extend a 13-and-a-half-month sentence he is already serving for organising an illegal assembly.Wong, whom magistrate Daniel Tang called an "iconic figure", thanked his supporters, some of who chanted, "I miss you" and "Hang in there."In October 2019, Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam invoked colonial-era emergency powers for the first time in more than 50 years to enact a regulation banning face masks, which many pro-democracy protesters used to hide their identities from authorities.Under the law, it was illegal to wear a mask at both lawful and unlawful assemblies. Offenders faced a maximum one year in jail and a HK$25,000 fine.People who needed to wear masks for health, religious or job-related reasons were exempt, although critics said the ban was confusing.Wong was among 47 democrats charged with conspiracy to commit subversion in late February under the city’s national security law for running in an unofficial primary election in July last year, the largest single crackdown on the opposition since the law was implemented.He is currently serving a 13-and-a-half-month sentence for organising and inciting an unlawful assembly near the city’s police headquarters in June 2019.The former British colony of Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule in 1997 with the promise of wide-ranging autonomy and freedoms that pro-democracy activists, who brought parts of the city to frequent halts in sometimes violent protests in 2019, say are being whittled away by Communist Party rulers in Beijing.China denies interference.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-activist-joshua-wong-jailed-for-4-months-for-2019-protest-101618307253247.html
13-04-2021||World||'Overworked': Austria's health minister quits, cites 'personal health problems'||Austria's health minister announced his resignation on Tuesday, saying that he couldn't continue in the grueling job of helping lead the country's coronavirus response because of persistent personal health problems caused by overwork.Rudolf Anschober, 60, had been health minister since January last year, when his Green party became the junior partner in a governing coalition under conservative Chancellor Sebastian Kurz.The soft-spoken minister has been one of the main faces of Austria's coronavirus response, which has gathered mixed reviews.Anschober, who suffered a burnout nine years ago, said he had suffered two episodes of sudden fatigue in the past month, as well as high blood pressure and tinnitus.He said he had “clearly overworked” and hadn't felt “completely fit” for several weeks. This wasn't a burnout, he added, but doctors advised him to take a break.“In the most serious health crisis for decades, the republic needs a health minister who is 100% fit,” Anschober said. “I am not at the moment, and I won't be in the coming weeks if I don't pull the emergency brake.”“This pandemic takes no breaks and so a health minister can't take a break either,” he added.Austria was one of the first countries in western Europe to mandate the use of masks last year and was able to ease its first lockdown quickly.Like several other European countries, it has struggled to find a consistent line in the pandemic since last fall. Austria bet heavily on opening up some sectors for people with negative tests, but hasn't been able to break a succession of lockdowns and currently has an infection rate significantly higher than neighboring Germany's.“On the whole, I think we have done good work,” Anschober said. “In a pandemic, no one is free of mistakes. Everyone makes mistakes. ... We were in uncharted territory.”“My impression is that it isn't 15 months, more like 15 years,” he said of his time in office.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/overworked-austria-s-health-minister-quits-cites-personal-health-problems-101618304747104.html
13-04-2021||World||Iran warns sabotage affects Vienna talks over nuclear deal||Iran's foreign minister warned Tuesday that an attack on its main nuclear enrichment site at Natanz affects ongoing negotiations in Vienna over its tattered atomic deal with world powers.Mohammad Javad Zarif's remarks, alongside visiting Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, come as the U.S. has insisted it had nothing to do with the sabotage Sunday at the Natanz nuclear facility. While not claiming the attack, Israel is widely believed to have carried out the still-unexplained assault that damaged centrifuges there.“Americans should know that neither sanctions nor sabotage actions would provide them with an instrument for talks," Zarif said in Tehran. “They should know that these actions would only make the situation difficult for them.”Kayhan, the hard-line Tehran newspaper, urged Iran to "walk out of the Vienna talks, suspend all nuclear commitments, retaliate against Israel and identify and dismantle the domestic infiltration network behind the sabotage.”“Despite evidence that shows the role of the U.S. as main instigator of nuclear sabotage against Iran, unfortunately some statesmen, by purging the U.S. of responsibility, (aid) Washington’s crimes against the people of Iran,” the paper said in Tuesday's editions.While Kayhan is a small-circulation newspaper, its editor-in-chief, Hossein Shariatmadari ,was appointed by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and has been described as an adviser to him in the past.Such a walkout remains unlikely as the administration of President Hassan Rouhani, whose main diplomatic achievement was the 2015 accord, hopes to get the U.S. to rejoin it and provide desperately needed sanctions relief. However, pressure does appear to be growing within Iran's theocracy over how to respond to the attack.Details remained scarce about what happened early Sunday at Natanz. The event was initially described only as a blackout in the electrical grid feeding above-ground workshops and underground enrichment halls — but later Iranian officials began referring to it as an attack. Israeli media, which has close ties with the military and intelligence services of that country, have described the sabotage as a cyberattack, without offering evidence or sourcing to support that.The extent of the damage at Natanz also remains unclear, though Iran's Foreign Ministry has described it as damaging Iran's first-generation IR-1 centrifuges, the workhorse of its nuclear program. A former Iranian Revolutionary Guard chief said Tuesday that the assault set off a fire while a civilian nuclear program spokesman mentioned a “possible minor explosion.”In remarks aired late Monday by state television. the former head of the country's civilian nuclear arm offered his own description of the attack, calling its design “very beautiful.” The attack appeared to target both the power grid at Natanz, as well as the facility's emergency backup power fed by separate batteries, Fereydoun Abbasi said.Abbasi said a similar attack targeted Iran's underground Fordo facility in 2012 with two explosions: one 30 kilometers (18.5 miles) away at a power station and the other at Fordo's emergency battery system.“We had predicted that and we were using a separate power grid,” Abbasi said.

13-04-2021||World||Britain meets target on jabs for over-50s||Britain says it has hit its target of giving at least one dose of vaccine to everyone over 50 and others in groups at highest risk from the coronavirus by mid-April.The government says everyone in those groups has been offered a jab, and about 95% of eligible people have received a shot.More than 32 million people, over 60% of adults, have had a first shot and almost 15% of people in the U.K. have had both doses.On Tuesday the vaccination drive was expanded to people aged 45-49, the start of the second phase of the inoculation campaign.Britain has had Europe’s worst coronavirus outbreak, with more than 127,000 confirmed deaths. But rapid vaccination, and a nationwide lockdown have sharply decreased infections and deaths.Lockdown restrictions are now being lifted, with nonessential shops, hairdressers, gyms and pub and restaurant patios reopening in England on Monday.Health authorities are also concerned about new variants that are more resistant to the vaccines. They are calling for everyone living in two boroughs in south London to get tested after 44 cases of a strain first identified in South Africa were confirmed there.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/britain-meets-target-on-jabs-for-over50s-101618304157532.html

In one of the most potent signs of Wall Street’s growing acceptance of cryptocurrencies, Coinbase will list on the Nasdaq on April 14 at a valuation of about $100 billion.“It’s the evolution of an industry that used to sit on the periphery,” said Nick Jones, CEO and co-founder at cryptocurrency wallet Zumo. “It really blurs the lines between crypto and more traditional financial institutions.”Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan Stanley have announced plans to offer their clients access to crypto investments. Tesla Inc. earlier this year disclosed a $1.5 billion investment in Bitcoin and more recently started accepting it as payment for electric cars.Still, some skeptics argue that digital coins have been inflated by stimulus that’s also sent stocks to records. Regulators around the world are stepping up oversight and casting doubt on its usefulness as a currency.Coinbase’s public debut this week is also boosting the digital coins of other cryptocurrency exchanges, such as Binance Coin, which has jumped to become the third-most valuable cryptocurrency behind Bitcoin and Ether.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bitcoin-rallies-to-all-time-high-as-traders-eye-coinbase-listing-101618303730163.html

Even though it is festival time right now, we cannot have fun. We will not be happy until this dictator is overthrown and we will revolt until then," a university student in Mandalay told AFP, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the danger of arrest.Another protester named Ray in Yangon said the pots were a way to welcome the new year and "honour fallen heroes"."There will be a whole itinerary of things to do in the coming five days to show that we are against this dictatorship happening in Myanmar and that we will keep fighting for democracy," he told AFP.In Mandalay -- Myanmar's cultural hub -- people placed the pots and flowers on a golden stupa, with signs showing the three-fingered salute that has become a symbol of the resistance movement.Young people in Mawlamyine, the fourth largest city, took to the streets early Tuesday while people marched with pots and flowers in the city of Dawei and small towns in Shan and Kachin states.Meanwhile, security forces found and defused a bomb beneath the Myaynigone bridge in Yangon on Tuesday morning, a police source said.Hiding in the jungleEthnic armed rebel groups have stepped up attacks on the military and police in recent weeks, raising fears of Myanmar spiralling into broader civil conflict.The military has retaliated with air strikes which the Free Burma Rangers, a Christian aid group working in the area, said had displaced more than 24,000 civilians in Karen state by Saturday.The Rangers, who run a health clinic in the state, said air strikes had killed at least 20 people and wounded more than 40.The area is remote and communications are difficult, and AFP has not been able to independently verify the deaths.The group said a 60-year-old man was killed and an 11 year-old girl wounded in mortar bomb attacks last week.Villagers in some areas were unable to prepare their rice crops because of fears the military would shell them in their fields, the aid group said."They are afraid they will have no rice harvest next fall," Free Burma Rangers said in a statement.In Yangon, authorities are hunting those responsible for an underground newsletter titled "Molotov" that is circulating both online and in printed form across the country.The publication was started by a group of young activists to fight ongoing internet outages and information suppression."The Molotov journal is illegally published," the state Global New Light of Myanmar said, adding that legal action would be taken against those involved and anyone offering assistance to the publication.Overnight, the junta announced a further 20 people were added to an arrest warrant list of 200 celebrities, including actors and singers, who are accused of spreading dissent against the military.If convicted they could face three years' jail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/anticoup-protesters-rally-on-myanmar-new-year-holiday-101618303408807.html
13-04-2021||World||China warns 34 tech firms to curb excess in antitrust review||China ordered 34 internet corporations Tuesday to rectify their anti-competitive practices within the next month, signaling that Beijing’s scrutiny of its most powerful firms hasn’t ended with the conclusion of a probe into Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.Shares in Tencent Holdings Ltd. and Meituan extended losses after the State Administration for Market Regulation issued a stern statement emphasizing it will continue to eradicate abuses of information and market dominance among other violations. Also summoned to an ad-hoc meeting with the watchdog on Tuesday were industry leaders including TikTok owner ByteDance Ltd., search giant Baidu Inc. and JD.com Inc.Regulators warned internet companies to “heed Alibaba’s example,” reaffirming their intent to abolish forced exclusivity among other practices. The meeting -- organized jointly with the cyberspace and tax regulators -- came days after Beijing wrapped up a four-month probe into Alibaba by slapping a record $2.8 billion fine on the e-commerce giant for abuse of market dominance.The penalty was less severe than many feared and lifted a cloud of uncertainty hanging over founder Jack Ma’s internet empire. It also came after the Chinese central bank ordered an overhaul of his Ant Group Co. fintech titan.Alibaba’s shares have gained 7% since the start of the week, but its fellow Chinese internet giants have gyrated while investors digest the rapid-fire announcements and concerns grow that Beijing’s scrutiny will extend beyond Alibaba. On Tuesday, Tencent gave up early gains to finish down slightly while Meituan, video service Kuaishou Technology and JD all slid more than 3% in Hong Kong.“The base line of policies cannot the crossed, the red line of laws cannot be touched,” the market watchdog said in the statement on Tuesday.The investigation into Alibaba was one of the opening salvos in a campaign seemingly designed to curb the power of China’s internet leaders, which kicked off after Ma infamously rebuked “pawn shop” lenders, regulators who don’t get the internet, and the “old men” of the global banking community. Those comments set in motion an unprecedented regulatory offensive, including scuttling Ant’s $35 billion initial public offering.The 34 firms summoned Tuesday must now undergo complete rectification after conducting internal checks and inspections over the next month, and make a pledge to society to obey rules and laws, the antitrust watchdog said in its statement. Regulators will organize follow-up inspections and companies that continue to engage in abuses like forced exclusivity -- a practice that “flagrantly trampled and destroyed” market order -- will be dealt with severely.The regulator also highlighted abuses like acquisitions that squeeze out smaller rivals and burning through cash to grab market share in community group buying, currently the hottest e-commerce arena in China. Firms also need to address issues like counterfeiting, data leaks and tax evasion, according to the statement.“This is positive because the SAMR is giving the platforms one month to review their practices, rather than dish out fines and penalties without warning,” Bloomberg Intelligence senior analyst Vey-Sern Ling said. “They are using Alibaba as an example to deter misbehavior from the rest of the industry players. If these companies toe the line, industry competition can become healthier. ”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-warns-34-tech-firms-to-curb-excess-in-antitrust-review-101618303200345.html

Wild mammals, in particular, pose a risk for the emergence of new diseases," it said."Traditional markets, where live animals are held, slaughtered and dressed, pose a particular risk for pathogen transmission to workers and customers alike," said the guidance.It also called on governments to close sections of food markets selling live wild mammals unless adequate risk assessments were in place.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-who-seeks-ban-on-sale-of-live-wild-mammals-in-food-markets-101618299676073.html

But Politico has reported that the Canadian government, which is a major sponsor of HFX, could rethink the partnership because it doesn’t want to overtly upset the Chinese government by backing a forum that intends to award Tsai, a prominent critic of Beijing.Relations between Canada and China have been rocky since 2018, but at the same time, Ottawa reportedly doesn’t want to aggravate the ties further by staying associated with the Canadian security forum that seeks to honour the Taiwanese president.Beijing recognises Taiwan as part of its territory, while President Tsai deems Taiwan as a territory independent of mainland China’s firm control.Canada’s defence minister Harjit Sajjan, when asked to comment on the development, refused to be drawn into committing himself into a decisive position as of now.Appearing before the House of Commons committee on Canada-China relations, Sajjan was asked if Ottawa would cut off funding to HFX as a result of its decision to award the Taiwanese president. “When the funding request comes to me, as it does every year, I have stated I will take a look at it,” Sajjan was quoted as saying in response, according to CBC News. “The Halifax International Security Forum is an independent organisation and they make their own choices with regards to the awards.”The defence minister traditionally inaugurates HFX’s conference and delivers a keynote speech.The Politico report has already led to criticism of the Canadian government from observers including the late Senator John McCain’s daughter, Meghan McCain. “Absolutely pathetic - Canadian government is a bunch of cowards condoning Chinese genocide,” she tweeted.Her mother Cindy is on the Halifax board of directors and is widely expected to soon be appointed an ambassador by the US government.HFX has yet to formally announce the awardee this year. Politico quoted its vice-president Robin Shepherd as saying, “President Tsai of Taiwan is a well respected international leader, the first female president of Taiwan, and a strong global advocate for democracy. She would certainly be an ideal fit for this award.” A spokesperson for Taiwan’s foreign affairs ministry, Joanne Ou, told the news outlet Focus Taiwan that if Tsai wins the prize, “it would be an affirmation and honour for both President Tsai and the people of Taiwan in their anti-pandemic efforts and democratic achievements”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/halifaxs-plans-to-award-beijing-critic-tsai-upsets-canadian-govt-report-101618299341306.html

13-04-2021||World||No nation is more important than India as US seeks to counter China: Think tank||A leading think tank for science and technology policy has said as Washington seeks to counter a rising China, no nation is more important than India with its abundance of highly skilled technical professionals and strong political and cultural ties with the United States.It however cautioned that "overreliance" on India as an IT services provider could become a strategic problem if major disagreements emerge between the two nations on issues such as intellectual property, data governance, tariffs, taxation, local content requirements or individual privacy.The Information Technology and Innovation Foundation (ITIF) think-tank in a report released on Monday describes the worst and best-case scenarios.In one, tensions between India and China are reduced and the many business synergies between these two neighbouring nations come to the fore. In this case, the heart of the global economy would shift to the east, and there would be little the United States could do about it, the report stated.In the second scenario, the interests of India and the United States become increasingly aligned, as the economic, military, and international relations challenges from China grow. In such a case, democratic norms could prevail across most of the developed world, as developing nations start looking to a 'Delhi model' instead of a 'Beijing model', it stated."As America seeks to counter a rising China, no nation is more important than India, with its vast size, an abundance of highly skilled technical professionals, and strong political and cultural ties with the United States."But the parallels between America's dependency on China for manufacturing and its dependency on India for IT services are striking," said the think-tank.According to David Moschella, a non-resident senior fellow at ITIF and co-author of the report, the same forces that increasingly divide the United States and China are now pushing the US and India closer together."The interplay between the United States, India, and China will shape global competition and digital innovation for years to come. While there is a wide range of possible scenarios, two things are clear: India should be an essential part of US efforts to compete with and reduce its dependence on China, and this will inevitably expand America's global dependencies from manufacturing to services,” he said."America's technology dependencies on India in the 2020s seem certain to rise. Yet it is important to know whether the United States will be dependent on a strategic partner with strong mutual interests, or on an increasingly neutral rival," said ITIF president Robert D. Atkinson, who co-authored the report with Moschella.Much will depend on the strategic choices that the Joe Biden administration and Indian government make in the next several years. One thing is clear that economic and geopolitical stakes could not be higher, he said.The report describes how India is making important progress in research and development, innovation centres, machine learning, analytics, product design and testing, and other areas, especially in IT and life sciences.While leading US tech companies are well-positioned in India's booming Internet and e-commerce marketplaces, strong local competitors are now emerging. Outside the technology sector, US companies operating in India face stiff competition from Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Indian, and other firms.Although doing business in India is still often difficult, most large US companies have expanded significantly to having IT service providers, large operations, or their own India-based capability centres, the report stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/no-nation-is-more-important-than-india-as-us-seeks-to-counter-china-think-tank-101618291338223.html
13-04-2021||World||Minneapolis under curfew after officer shoots Black motorist dead||Fresh protests broke out Tuesday night in Minneapolis despite a curfew implemented after a police officer fatally shot a young Black man when she appeared to confuse her handgun with her taser, fueling tensions in a US city already on edge because of the George Floyd murder trial.Shortly before 9:00 pm local time (0200GMT Tuesday), nearly two hours after the curfew went into effect, dozens of protesters continued to wave signs and chant slogans in front of the police station in Brooklyn Center, where Sunday's killing occurred.Demonstrators taunted police through newly-erected wire fencing around the station, and carried signs saying "Jail all racist killer cops," "Am I next?" and "No justice, no peace."Police fired tear gas at the protesters several times and ordered them to disperse.This was the second consecutive night of protests after 20-year-old Daunte Wright was shot dead by police while driving with his girlfriend.In police body camera video released earlier Monday in Brooklyn Center, an officer shouts "Taser! Taser! Taser!" but then instead fires a gun at the victim."The officer drew their handgun instead of their taser," said Brooklyn Center police chief Tim Gannon.Gannon said it was his belief that the officer, now on leave pending an investigation, "had the intention to deploy their taser but instead shot Mr Wright with a single bullet.""This was an accidental discharge that resulted in the tragic death of Mr Wright," Gannon said. "There is nothing I can say to lessen the pain of Mr Wright's family."Wright's killing sparked protests overnight in Brooklyn Center and the looting of a shopping mall, and authorities in Minneapolis and surrounding suburbs including Brooklyn Center announced a curfew from 7:00 pm (0000 GMT) Monday until 6:00 am Tuesday.In the body cam footage, police officers are seen pulling Wright out of his car after stopping him for a traffic violation and discovering he had an outstanding warrant.When officers attempt to handcuff Wright, he scuffles with them and gets back in the car. A female police officer shouts, "I'll tase you" and then "Taser! Taser! Taser!" -- standard police procedure before an officer fires one of the stun guns."Holy shit, I shot him," the officer says as Wright, fatally wounded, drives off. He crashed his car a few blocks away.How the officer mistook her gun for a taser was unclear.Gannon said police are trained to place handguns "on our dominant side, and our taser on our weak side."Minnesota's Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA) identified the officer late Monday as Kim Potter, a 26-year veteran of the police force.President Joe Biden called the killing "tragic," but warned against any potential violent unrest."I think we have to wait and see what the investigation shows," Biden said."In the meantime, I want to make it clear again: there is absolutely no justification, none, for looting," he added. "Peaceful protests -- understandable."The protests overnight prompted the defense attorney for former officer Derek Chauvin, who is facing murder and manslaughter charges for George Floyd's death, to ask the judge presiding over the high-profile case to sequester the jury.Judge Peter Cahill refused, stating "this is a totally different case."'Tragic events'Chauvin is facing murder and manslaughter charges for his role in Floyd's death on May 25, 2020, which occurred during his arrest for allegedly passing a fake $20 bill.The 45-year-old Chauvin, who is white, was seen in a video taken by a bystander kneeling on Floyd's neck for more than nine minutes as the handcuffed 46-year-old Black man complained repeatedly that he could not breathe.The video touched off protests against racial injustice and police brutality in the United States and around the world.Brooklyn Center, where Wright was shot, is a northwest suburb of Minneapolis located not far from the heavily guarded Hennepin County Government Center where Chauvin is on trial.Officers fired tear gas and flash bangs to disperse a crowd of hundreds who gathered outside a police station in Brooklyn Center after Wright was shot. National Guard troops were deployed."We are in pain right now, and we recognize that this couldn't have happened at a worse time," Brooklyn Center Mayor Mike Elliott said.The Minnesota Twins announced they were postponing their Monday baseball game against the Boston Red Sox "out of respect for the tragic events that occurred yesterday in Brooklyn Center."The US professional basketball and hockey leagues also postponed Monday games involving Minnesota teams.Prosecutors are seeking to prove Floyd's death was due to asphyxiation by the officers conducting the arrest and have called several medical experts to bolster their case.Chauvin's attorney claims Floyd's death was due to his consumption of the illegal drugs fentanyl and methamphetamine and underlying health conditions.Prominent cardiologist Jonathan Rich testified Monday that Floyd's death was caused by "low oxygen levels" that were "induced by the prone restraint and positional asphyxiation that he was subjected to.""I see no evidence at all that a fentanyl overdose caused Mr Floyd's death," Rich said.Ex-police officer and law professor Seth Stoughton also testified that he found the force used against Floyd to be "excessive" and "unreasonable."Floyd's brother, Philonise Floyd, 39, also took the witness stand and emotionally recounted stories from their childhood.Judge Cahill told jurors he expected Chauvin's defense to begin its presentation Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/minneapolis-under-curfew-after-officer-shoots-black-motorist-dead-101618288493407.html
13-04-2021||World||Natanz nuclear plant attack complicates US, Iran nuke talks||The attack on Iran’s Natanz nuclear facility is casting a major shadow over the resumption of indirect talks between the U.S. and Iran over resurrection of the international accord limiting Iran's nuclear program.Neither Iran nor the U.S. say the incident will crater the negotiations. But the attack and the destruction of a significant amount of Iran’s uranium enrichment capability add uncertainty to the discussions set for Tuesday in Vienna.The attack gives both sides reason to harden their positions, yet each has incentives to keep the talks on track.Iran wants Washington to lift sanctions that have contributed to damaging its economy, including measures not related to its nuclear program. It insists that the sanctions be lifted before it returns to compliance with the 2015 nuclear agreement that then-President Donald Trump pulled the U.S. out of in 2018.For the Biden administration, the talks are a high-stakes gamble that it can salvage what the Obama administration considered one of its prime foreign policy achievements and slow Iran's programs, even as critics claim the accord had given Iran a pathway to a nuclear weapon instead of closing it off.Iran has blamed Israel for the destruction at an important underground facility, and Israeli media has been filled with claims from unnamed officials claiming responsibility.The Biden administration, meanwhile, has taken a hand’s-off approach, neither praising nor condemning the attack. The White House said the U.S. “had no involvement” and had “nothing to add to speculation about the causes.”The attack adds a fresh complication to discussions in Vienna and also to President Joe Biden's efforts to smooth ties with Israel. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu enjoyed a close relationship with Trump, who abandoned the Iran agreement and began a campaign of “maximum pressure” on Iran by imposing harsh sanctions.The U.S. has said it is prepared to lift or ease sanctions that are “inconsistent” with the nuclear deal along with sanctions that are “inconsistent with the benefits” that Iran expected to get from agreeing to the accord. The deal had removed nuclear sanctions on Iran in exchange for curbs on its atomic program, although critics noted that many of those restrictions are time-limited and will expire before 2030.Those same critics, including many in Congress, have expressed concerns that non-nuclear sanctions — such as those imposed for terrorism, ballistic missile activity and human rights abuses — may be on the table in the negotiations. The administration has not specifically commented on that but has said it will not offer Iran sweeteners unrelated to the agreement.Israeli officials have raised concerns, too, about what they fear would be a precipitous U.S. return to the deal, and news of the attack broke as Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin was visiting Israel. Austin and Secretary of State Antony Blinken will be in Brussels later this week for talks with European and NATO allies likely to touch on Iran.As Austin and Blinken prepared to meet their counterparts in Brussels, German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas expressed concern that the attack could affect the talks. “All of what we are hearing from Tehran is not a positive contribution to this,” Maas told reporters.The destruction of advanced centrifuges at Natanz came at a critical time in the Vienna talks that are intended to resurrect the nuclear deal. Trump's withdrawal and his reintroduction of sanctions, along with Iran's decisions to break its own commitments to the agreement, have left it in significant jeopardy.The weekend attack on Natanz, one of Iran's main nuclear facilities, came amid a break in the Vienna talks.Key to the deal were restrictions on Iran's uranium enrichment. Activities at the heavily fortified Natanz facility, which is built into a mountain, were among those most constrained.Natanz has been targeted by sabotage in the past. The Stuxnet computer virus, discovered in 2010 and widely believed to be a joint U.S.-Israeli creation, once disrupted and destroyed Iranian centrifuges there during an earlier period of Western fears about Tehran’s program.Last July, Natanz suffered a mysterious explosion at its advanced centrifuge assembly plant that authorities later described as sabotage. Iran now is rebuilding that facility deep inside a nearby mountain. Iran also blamed Israel for that, as well as the November killing of a scientist who began the country’s military nuclear program decades ago.Israel also has launched a series of airstrikes in neighboring Syria targeting Iranian forces and their equipment. And Israel is suspected in an attack last week on an Iranian cargo ship that is said to serve as a floating base for Iran’s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard forces off the coast of Yemen.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/natanz-nuclear-plant-attack-complicates-us-iran-nuke-talks-101618288476491.html
13-04-2021||World||60 years since first human spaceflight||Yuri Alekseyevich Gagarin became the first human being to cross into outer space in his capsule Vostok 1 as many as 60 years ago. Gagarin's spacecraft was launched on April 12, 1961 and it reached back on earth on May 3, 1961.The 108-minute-long journey set a major milestone in the Space race between the USA and the Soviet Union. Gagarin was 27 years old when he achieved the feat. Two days before blastoff, he even wrote a farewell letter to his wife, sharing his pride in being chosen to ride in Vostok 1 but also trying to console her in the event of his death, news agency AP reported.“I fully trust the equipment, it mustn’t let me down.

Officials said that the building had violated safety requirements by housing too many people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/massive-fire-at-ruusia-s-historic-saint-petersburg-factory-still-burning-101618280495884.html

The researchers found no difference in risks of severe disease, death, or other clinical outcomes in patients with B.1.1.7 and other variants."Our data, within the context and limitations of a real-world study, provide initial reassurance that severity in hospitalised patients with B.1.1.7 is not markedly different from severity in those without," the researchers said in the study.A separate study published in The Lancet Public Health medical journal found that vaccines were likely to be effective against the British variant since there was no apparent increase in reinfection rate when compared to non-UK variants.According to British scientists, the British variant was about 40%-70% more transmissible than previously dominant variants.The studies also confirmed the previous findings that B.1.1.7 was more transmissible.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/british-variant-of-covid-19-not-as-severe-as-feared-study-101618279922909.html
13-04-2021||World||Washington state proposal targets Boeing plant’s pollution||Boeing will spend millions of dollars and decades cleaning up pollutants that have seeped into the soil and groundwater beneath one of their plants in Washington state, a state-mandated draft proposal said.TCE, or Trichloroethylene, is one of many pollutants that have been found in groundwater near Boeing's Everett, Washington, plant, the Daily Herald reported Sunday.TCE is a solvent that is used to degrease metal parts and is a carcinogen to humans. The US Environmental Protection Agency said in 2016 that TCE can also affect fetus development, irritate the respiratory system and cause light-headedness, drowsiness and headaches.The National Cancer Institute considers TCE a “cancer-causing substance.”Last year, the solvent was detected in groundwater near the plant at a concentration more than 1,000 times the state limit.“Boeing is in the final stages of environmental cleanup at our Everett site, under a draft set of studies, plans and orders and other documents available for public comment from the Washington Department of Ecology,” the company said in a written statement. “We are committed to a comprehensive cleanup of the Powder Mill Gulch area of Everett and have made considerable progress in reducing groundwater contamination through a variety of interim action cleanup activities."The full cost of the cleanup is not publicly known. Boeing declined to say what the cleanup is expected to cost.Several other contaminants have been discovered at the roughly 1,000-acre (405 hectares) Boeing site. The contaminants include fuels such as oil, gasoline, lead, hydraulic jet fluid, polychlorinated biphenyls and carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.The chemicals came from a range of manufacturing operations, according to the cleanup documents.Boeing “no longer uses TCE as a widespread cleaning solvent as it did in the past,” the department said. Small quantities of the chemical are still used in one of its labs, according to the Washington State Department of Ecology.The most expensive and time-consuming part of the Everett cleanup plan involves a process known as bioremediation, in which Boeing will inject nutrients into the soil to help natural bacteria break down TCE. Boeing would invest heavily in improvements to an existing system that pumps out contaminated groundwater, treats it then releases it, according to the proposal.The state-mandated draft proposal is 163 pages and will open for public comment on April 19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/washington-state-proposal-targets-boeing-plant-s-pollution-101618278956990.html
13-04-2021||World||Ireland to limit AstraZeneca jab to over-60s||Ireland will limit the AstraZeneca coronavirus jab to those aged over 60, the country's chief medical officer said Monday, following European reviews of evidence linking it to rare blood clotting cases.The decision follows similar moves by several other European nations that have halted use of the vaccine among younger people following the EU medicines regulator's ruling this month that it could be linked to the rare clots.Ireland's National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC) said the AstraZeneca product "is not recommended for those aged under 60 years".The updated recommendations would be incorporated into the vaccination programme and vaccine re-allocated, chief medical officer Ronan Glynn said.Ireland, which has a population of around five million, has so far given nearly 750,000 people a first Covid-19 vaccine dose, according to the latest available statistics.Along with other EU countries, it has struggled to match the speed of neighbouring Britain's successful rollout, which has relied heavily on the AstraZeneca jab.UK regulators have only limited its use in the under-30s.NIAC chair Karina Butler noted that the shot, which was developed in partnership with Britain's Oxford University, was "highly effective and substantially reduces the risk of severe Covid-19 disease across all age groups".But the committee had opted to change its advice in light of the reviews."NIAC realises the need to balance the significant benefits of a national vaccination programme with the very rare risk of these reported events," she said in a statement."While this is an extremely rare condition, consideration must be given to the fact that it has a very high risk of death or severe outcome."As the risk/benefits of Vaxzevria Covid-19 AstraZeneca vaccine may vary by age, and as alternative Covid-19 vaccines are available, NIAC has revised the recommendations for use of this vaccine," she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ireland-to-limit-astrazeneca-jab-to-over60s-101618279717816.html

That means more than 32 million people have been given the precious protection vaccines provide against Covid-19.""I want to thank everyone involved in the vaccine rollout which has already saved many thousands of lives. We will now move forward with completing essential second doses and making progress towards our target of offering all adults a vaccine by the end of July," he added.According to the UK Government, all adults over 50, the clinically vulnerable and health and social care workers have now been offered coronavirus vaccine shots."The target was reached ahead of schedule, with the government having pledged to offer a first dose to priority cohorts 1-9 by 15 April," Downing Street said, adding that "nearly 40 million vaccines have now been given in total, with adults under 50 expected to begin to be invited in the coming days."Those in their late 40s are expected to be next in line to be invited for coronavirus vaccine shots as the UK moves into the next phase of its mass vaccination campaign, according to Sputnik."Over 7 million second doses have now been given - with a record 475,230 given on Saturday - and we remain on track to offer a first vaccine to all adults by 31 July," Downing Street said.The mass vaccination campaign started in the UK in December of last year.The UK has now confirmed a total of over 4.3 million coronavirus cases and the country's Covid-19 death toll stands at more than 127,000, according to Johns Hopkins University, as reported by Sputnik.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-completes-covid-19-vaccination-target-of-people-over-50-ahead-of-schedule-101618275547105.html

Going against the medical consensus around Covid, Bolsonaro has downplayed the severity of the virus, opposed lockdowns and only recently embraced vaccines as a solution.Last week, a Supreme Court justice cleared the way for the Senate inquiry, which the Senate president had sought to delay despite it having garnered support from the necessary number of senators.The Supreme Court is expected to uphold the ruling when the full court hears the case later this week, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters on Monday, although it may grant the chamber leeway to decide when to install the committee.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brazil-records-1-480-more-deaths-due-to-covid-as-probe-pressures-prez-bolsonaro-101618272044793.html
13-04-2021||World||CDC chief urges Michigan to 'close things down' amid spike in Covid cases||The director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Monday that Michigan should “close things down” to help address the country's worst coronavirus outbreak, days after Gov. Gretchen Whitmer instead urged people to voluntarily restrict certain activities.Dr. Rochelle Walensky made the statement after being asked about some public health experts' calls to send additional doses of Covid-19 vaccine to the state, for which the governor has been advocating. The administration of President Joe Biden has stuck with allocating to states proportionally by population.“So when you have an acute situation, extraordinary number of cases like we have in Michigan, the answer is not necessarily to give vaccine,” Walensky said, explaining that it takes two to six weeks to see the effect of vaccinations. “The answer to that is to really close things down, to go back to our basics, to back to where we were last spring, last summer and to shut things down, to flatten the curve, to decrease contact with one another, to test ... to contact trace.”Michigan hospitals on Monday reported treating about 3,900 adults with confirmed Covid-19 cases, which surpassed a previous peak from Dec. 1 and was close to the state's record high from last April of roughly 4,000. The seven-day average of daily new cases was 7,359 as of Saturday, up from 4,661 two weeks prior, according to Johns Hopkins University. The seven-day average of daily deaths, 43, more than doubled from 20 in the same period.Earlier Monday, Whitmer again said Michigan's third surge is different because of vaccines and, unlike a year ago, it is known that masks are effective and the state has adequate testing and personal protective equipment. She has urged — but not required — a two-week suspension of in-person high school instruction, youth sports and indoor dining.“We each have enough information to do our part,” she said after touring a vaccination clinic at Eastern Michigan University. “That's what we're calling on people to do — to do your part."About 40% of Michigan residents ages 16 and up had received at least one shot as of last week.The Democratic governor last spring issued a monthslong stay-at-home order to curb the virus, later lifting it. Republican lawmakers successfully challenged the law that underpinned her restrictions. In the fall, amid a second wave of cases, the state health department took steps such as closing high schools, prohibiting contact sports, and banning indoor service at restaurants and bars. The restrictions were gradually loosened as metrics improved.Whitmer spokesman Bobby Leddy said Michigan has implemented CDC standards and still has some of the strongest restrictions in the Midwest, including a mask mandate and capacity limits on indoor dining, indoor gatherings and entertainment venues.“As our nation’s top health experts have said, this is not a failure of policy, but rather a compliance, variant and mobility issue, which is why it’s important for us to ramp up vaccinations as quickly as possible,” he said.In Michigan, one in every 194 people was diagnosed with Covid-19 in the past week — the highest rate in the US. The state's case rates have been rising since mid-February and hospitalizations have been increasing since early March.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/cdc-chief-urges-michigan-to-close-things-down-amid-spike-in-covid-cases-101618271541039.html
13-04-2021||World||US police officer fired for pepper-spraying Black soldier||A US police officer has been fired after footage emerged of a Black army officer being detained at gunpoint and pepper-sprayed in the face in Virginia, prompting the state's governor Sunday to promise a full investigation.Lieutenant Caron Nazario, who is Black and Latino, repeatedly asked what he had done wrong and said, "This is really messed up," as two police officers holding guns demanded he get out of his car.Wearing his military uniform, Nazario was driving a newly bought SUV in the small Virginia town of Windsor last December when the officers ordered him to pull over because he did not have permanent license plates, news reports said.The police accused him of not cooperating before blasting him with pepper-spray and forcing him to the ground.Virginia governor Ralph Northam said in a statement he had instructed police to conduct an "independent investigation" into the incident, which he said was "disturbing and angered me."A separate statement from Windsor authorities on Sunday said that one of the officers involved had been fired after an internal investigation showed that police procedure was "not followed" during the incident.The Washington Post said that Nazario, a health administration officer with the Virginia National Guard, was driving home on December 5 when he was pulled over.Footage from the officers' bodycams and Nazario's phone spread rapidly over the weekend after Nazario filed a lawsuit on April 2 seeking $1 million in damages.He was released without charge after the incident.The lawsuit reportedly claims police threatened to end his military career if he spoke out about the officers' conduct."We must keep working to ensure Virginians are safe during interactions with police, the enforcement of laws is fair and equitable, and people are held accountable," Northam said.Police in the United States have been hit with multiple allegations of racism and misconduct, including over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis last year in a case that attracted international outrage.A police officer is currently on trial over the 46-year-old Black man's death, facing charges of manslaughter and murder.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-police-officer-fired-for-pepper-spraying-black-soldier-101618271456685.html
13-04-2021||World||Fox stands behind Tucker Carlson after ADL urges his firing||Fox Corp. is standing behind Tucker Carlson after the Anti-Defamation League last week called for the company to fire the opinion host for his on-air defense of the white-supremacist “great replacement” theory.In a letter sent Sunday to the civil rights group and shared with The Associated Press, Fox CEO Lachlan Murdoch said Carlson had “decried and rejected replacement theory" when he said during the Thursday evening segment, “White replacement theory? No, no, this is a voting rights question.”The ADL argued in a reply sent Monday to Murdoch that Carlson used white-supremacist language even if he claimed he didn't.“Mr. Carlson’s attempt to at first dismiss this theory, while in the very next breath endorsing it under cover of ‘a voting rights question,’ does not give him free license to invoke a white supremacist trope,” wrote ADL CEO Jonathan Greenblatt.The replacement conspiracy theory holds that people of color are replacing white people in the West, enabled by Jews and progressive politicians.During a guest appearance Thursday on “Fox News Primetime," Carlson “embraced a foundational theory of white supremacy," the ADL said.During the show, Carlson said “the left and all the little gatekeepers on Twitter become literally hysterical if you use the term ‘replacement,’ if you suggest that the Democratic Party is trying to replace the current electorate of voters now casting ballots with new people, more obedient voters from the Third World." He added that he had “less political power because they are importing a brand new electorate.”The ADL also listed numerous instances Carlson has used anti-immigrant language in the past, including blaming immigration for making the U.S. “poorer, and dirtier, and more divided," and questioned whether white supremacy was real.Murdoch noted in his letter that the ADL had once honored his father, Rupert Murdoch, with a leadership award. The ADL's Greenblatt replied that the award was granted “over a decade ago, but let me be clear that we would not do so today, and it does not absolve you, him, the network, or its board from the moral failure of not taking action against Mr. Carlson.”A Fox spokesperson declined to comment on the ADL's Monday letter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fox-stands-behind-tucker-carlson-after-adl-urges-his-firing-101618265964493.html

Mexico said on March 22 that it had close to 9,000 troops from the defense ministry, Navy and National Guard on its northern and southern borders.A Mexican National Guard member deployed to the area said the force's daily arrest rate had doubled in recent weeks.In January, just before U.S. President Joe Biden took office, Guatemala deployed security forces to halt a U.S.-bound caravan of migrants, and Guatemalan government officials have vowed to keep up the pressure. Honduras also deployed forces in response to a small U.S.-bound migrant caravan over Easter.Earlier, White House aide Tyler Moran said the Biden administration secured agreements with Mexico, Honduras and Guatemala to put more troops on their own borders.Moran appeared to have been referring to the March deployments.Mexico's government said in a statement that it would maintain current troop numbers at its borders.The Guatemalan presidency said security efforts at the border were implemented last year. When asked about Guatemala reaching an agreement with Washington on troop deployment, a spokesperson said, "there is no deal signed in this sense."Honduran defense minister Fredy Santiago Diaz said his government was weighing its options on border troop numbers.Deploying more troops was not discussed by a recent delegation to Washington, but Honduras would take U.S. requests to curb migration into account if it did, he told local radio.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mexico-doubles-migrant-detentions-with-troop-surge-white-house-says-101618266003421.html

He’s now serving a 23-year term in New York after being convicted of sexual assault by a Manhattan jury last year.Weinstein was first charged by Los Angeles prosecutors in 2020, and now the indictment by a state grand jury there marks the technical start of that case and means Weinstein may soon extradited to mount his defense. Appearing at a virtual hearing from Wende Correctional Facility in upstate New York, defense lawyer Norman Effman told a judge that his client would seek to delay that case so he can first get medical treatment for diabetes and other conditions.Weinstein appeared slimmer than he was at his Manhattan trial and smiled frequently during the hearing. He told his Los Angeles attorney, Mark Werksman, that he liked his comment dismissing the California case as “stale” in a weekend news story. The indictment remains under seal.“I really, really appreciated that statement,” Weinstein told Werksman just before the hearing began. “That was awesome.”Weinstein’s next extradition hearing is set for April 30.

13-04-2021||World||US budget deficit jumps to record $1.7 trillion this year||The US government's budget deficit surged to an all-time high of $1.7 trillion for the first six months of this budget year, nearly double the previous record, as another round of economic-support checks added billions of dollars to spending last month.In its monthly budget report, the Treasury Department said Monday that the deficit for the first half of the budget year — from October through March — was up from a shortfall of $743.5 billion in the same period a year ago.The deficit has been driven higher by trillions of dollars in support Congress has passed in successive economic rescue packages since the pandemic struck in early March 2020. The latest round came in a $1.9 trillion measure that President Joe Biden pushed through Congress last month.Biden's package included individual support payments of up to $1,400 and the administration rushed to make those payments as soon as the president signed the measure into law. The Treasury Department statement showed that the payments in March totaled $339 billion.The budget report showed that the deficit for just March totaled $659.6 billion, the third-highest monthly deficit. For the six-month period, the $1.7 trillion deficit total surpassed the previous record of an $829 billion deficit run up for the six months ending in March 2011. That was a period when the government was spending to deal with the economic damage from the recession caused by the 2008 financial crisis.Last year's deficit, for the budget year that ended Sept. 30, totaled a record $3.1 trillion. The Congressional Budget Office estimated in February that this fiscal year's deficit would total $2.3 trillion. But that estimate did not include the cost of Biden's $1.9 trillion rescue plan that Congress passed in March or the impact of the administration's “Build Back Better” infrastructure proposal that Congress is considering now.Nancy Vanden Houten, senior economist at Oxford Economics, said she expects the deficit for this budget year will total $3.3 trillion, an all-time high but up just 6.5% from last year's record shortfall of $3.1 trillion.Analysts said the deficit's surge in the first six months of the fiscal year reflected that the first half of the 2020 budget year was mostly unaffected by the pandemic. The loss of revenue from millions of job lost and the big spending measures Congress passed to deal with the pandemic-triggered recession occurred in the second half of the 2020 budget year.Vanden Houten said that, while she expects Congress will pass some version of Biden's $2 trillion infrastructure bill, the budget impact will not occur until the start of the next fiscal year.For the first six months of the current budget year, Treasury said revenues totaled $1.7 trillion, a drop of 5.5% from the same period last year. Spending was $3.4 trillion, up 45.3%.Biden's rescue program passed without Republican support, unlike the previous packages passed during the Trump administration, which were backed by both Republican and Democratic lawmakers.Republicans contend that new spending is not needed in light of rising deficits and increased signs that the economy is starting to rebound.The Treasury report Monday showed that through the first six months of the current budget year, interest payments on the debt total $229 billion, $41 billion below the same period a year ago. That reflects lower interest rates on the rising level of debt.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-budget-deficit-jumps-to-record-1-7-trillion-this-year-101618261927288.html

The cocktail already has emergency U.S. approval for mild to moderate Covid-19 patients, and the companies are hoping the latest trials convince regulators to expand deployment."These data suggest that REGEN-COV can complement widespread vaccination strategies, particularly for those at high risk of infection," said Myron Cohen, who leads monoclonal antibody efforts for the U.S. National Institutes of Health-sponsored Covid Prevention Network.A challenge in breaking infection chains, he said, is that some 10% of unvaccinated people in the study who didn't get the Roche-Regeneron drug while living in a household with an infected individual developed symptomatic infection even with efforts to reduce transmission.'HIGH-RISK SETTINGS'"REGEN-COV could help control outbreaks in high-risk settings" where people haven't been vaccinated, Cohen said.In the separate trial, Regeneron said the cocktail also cut symptomatic infection risk and helped nearly halve the total weeks that patients experienced symptoms, with the viral burden -- the amount of virus present -- cut by more than 90%."These data pave the way for REGEN-COV to be used before patients become symptomatic," Katharine Bar, co-principal investigator and a professor at the University of Pennsylvania hospital, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/regeneron-to-seek-us-approval-for-covid-19-cocktail-to-be-used-for-prevention-101618257437058.html

He's going to be OK. I thanked him for putting his life on the line to protect students and staff at the school. He said he'd rather be hurt than anybody else," Mayor Indya Kincannon told CBS News.Investigators did not identify the suspect or slain victim except to say they were both male. It was not yet clear if either was a student at Austin-East Magnet School."Knoxville Police Department officers responded to Austin-East Magnet High School on the report of a male subject who was possibly armed in the school," department officials said on Facebook."Upon approach of the subject, shots were fired. A KPD officer was struck at least one time and transported to the (University of Tennessee) Medical Center with injuries that are not expected to be life-threatening. One male was pronounced deceased at the scene, while another was detained for further investigation."Police had initially reported "multiple gunshot victims" in the attack.PARENTS RUSH TO SCENE"The school building has been secured and students who were not involved in the incident have been released to their families," Knoxville schools superintendent Bob Thomas said on Twitter.Agents from the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives would assist other law enforcement agencies, the bureau's Nashville office said on Twitter.Police established a reunification site for families of the students at the baseball field behind the school.A mother who had been separated from her daughter was waiting near the school and was relieved to receive a text message from the girl that she was safe.The Knoxville high school community has been ravaged by gun violence in the last few months, with at least three students at Austin-East having been killed this year.The school, which had opened its classrooms after pandemic lockdowns, switched to remote learning for a few days in February so that students could grieve the deaths of two 15 year olds and one 16 year old, WBIR-TV News reported.In other shootings across the United States since mid-March, a man last week opened fire at the Texas cabinet-making plant where he worked, killing one person and wounding six others before he was arrested.Eight people were slain at Atlanta-area spas, 10 people at a supermarket in Boulder, Colorado, and four people, including a 9-year-old boy, at a real estate office in the Southern California city of Orange.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/police-report-multiple-victims-in-tennessee-school-shooting-101618259251843.html

These memorable words, by William Gibson, come to mind as I think about the course of the pandemic and consider what lies ahead. A variety of scenarios has unfolded around the world, the differences attributable to a combination of agency, constraints, and sometimes luck. However, the patterns have been predictable for a while.In any susceptible population that is not making strong efforts to reduce transmission, SARS-CoV2 will rapidly transmit with exponential growth until a combination of recovered people with immunity and heightened precautions slow the spread. This sequence of rapid rise, peak, and fall happens over about six to eight weeks in a city, during which health care systems get stressed and preventable deaths mount.The wave is broader for a large state or a country, being composed of smaller narrower waves occurring after each other, but is again predictable. This is what was seen all over the world during the first wave. India had the privilege of seeing this course of events in other nations and prepare, which limited our losses.It was equally clear from the rest of the world, especially the United Kingdom (UK) and Brazil, that the first wave was not the last. Immunity declines, the virus mutates to escape the immune pressure, and precautions melt away — setting the stage for new waves of explosive growth in freshly susceptible populations that are making only token efforts to reduce transmission. Recovered people show 20-30% decline in their virus neutralising immunity by six months, based on data from the CSIR serosurvey, now published in eLife.Also Read | Why is India seeing Covid-19 second wave? AIIMS chief Randeep Guleria explainsMutations of the virus make it able to evade what little immunity remains. The INSACOG sequencing consortium data clearly shows that not only have we seen explosive growth of imported variants, such as the B.1.1.7 UK variant, in Punjab, but have also had emergence of local variants such as B.1.617 in Maharashtra. The latter, with 15 lineage defining mutations, and two immune escape mutations — E484Q and L452R amino acid changes in the spike protein at sites important for antibody neutralisation and virus entry into cell — is worrisome.At a molecular level, these mutations make the virus more transmissible and able to evade immunity, potentially causing larger outbreaks and reinfections. Unlike B.1.1.7, where there is adequate vaccine data from UK to be confident that vaccination will prevent severe disease, we are yet to fully learn about the properties of B.1.617. Due to INSACOG efforts, I expect these answers to be available soon.Meanwhile, it does not seem that there is any significant increase in severity, although we have seen many more young infections this time. This may simply be because the outbreaks were in schools and colleges, unlike the first wave. The necessary public health measures remain exactly the same and the mask as vaccine concept stays important. This needs to be implemented more seriously and in a sensible manner. To be fined for not wearing a mask alone in one’s car, while masks are absent in crowded markets, makes little sense.Finally, we need to overcome vaccine hesitancy, with a clear understanding that infections will occur even after vaccination. They will just be fewer, milder and transmit less. The total lives lost to Covid-19 will drop drastically, if we combine basic precautions with vaccination.From a scientific standpoint, I see the glass as half-full. The identification of the indigenous variant has occurred in a timely manner, based on molecular filters, with correlation between the increase in variant and the rise in cases. There remains much room to improve the ecosystem, such that genomic findings are better integrated with clinical actionability. My institute’s direct experience working with the Kerala government suggests that this is very much possible when all stakeholders come together.Also Read | Sanjay Raut blames Centre for rising cases in Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, PunjabOne question that I get asked often is whether India is sequencing enough. My half-answer is that it depends on what we plan to do with the data. At a basic level, we sequence to stay abreast of the changes to the virus, so as to predict implications on vaccine efficacy and the expected trajectory of the pandemic. Some mutations, such as the E484K in South Africa (B.1.351) and Brazil (P1) variants, make the virus capable of escaping vaccine induced antibodies. In Bangladesh, B.1.351 has reached 80% of samples tested.As of March 2021, we have also seen a progressive increase of immune escape variants in Indian samples, including indigenous E484K mutants, but at a lower fraction. This is akin to seeing the future through events unfolding in our geographical vicinity, in a population similar to ours. Similarly, the outbreaks and rise of B.1.1.7 in Punjab, will surely be paralleled in neighbouring states in the natural course of events. The same story is currently being repeated in multiple parts of the globe. Our ongoing sequencing efforts have thus already provided warning signals for urgent public health preparedness and mobilisation.I now look forward to the next stage of this effort with faster and more comprehensive sequencing, combined with better clinical correlation, viral research, and timely public health action. The hope is not to just see the future, but to shape it.Anurag Agrawal is director, Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (Council of Scientific and Industrial Research)The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-the-future-is-here-101618229197360.html
13-04-2021||India||India, France discuss boosting cooperation, greater collaboration in diverse sectors||India and France on Tuesday discussed the possibility of boosting cooperation in diverse sectors such as trade and investment, defence and security, health, education, energy and climate change, and working jointly in the Indo-Pacific.These matters figured in talks between external affairs minister S Jaishankar and his visiting French counterpart Jean-Yves Le Drian, who is on an official visit to India during April 13-15. Le Drian will also participate in the Raisina Dialogue, the external affairs ministry’s annual flagship conference.During their meeting, the two sides “recognised the importance of fast-tracking the discussions on an India-EU trade and investment agreement” in order to tap the full potential of bilateral trade, the external affairs ministry said in a statement. India’s trade with France has seen a steady rise in the past decade, touching $10.75 billion in 2020. “In the context of the changes in a Covid-impacted world, both ministers recognised the immense opportunities for greater collaboration in diverse sectors such as trade and investments, defence and security, health, education, research and innovation, energy and climate change,” the statement said.Jaishankar and Le Drian discussed regional and global issues and reiterated their shared commitment to a multi-polar world and multilateralism. They also explored ways to strengthen cooperation in the Indo-Pacific, including through the India-France-Australia trilateral mechanism, and addressing emerging challenges in the maritime and space domains. In the area of climate action, India welcomed France’s decision to take up the “maritime resources” pillar of New Delhi’s Indo-Pacific Oceans Initiative (IPOI).“A comfortable, substantive and productive discussion with FM @JY_LeDrian. India and France will advance their shared post-COVID agenda through close collaboration,” Jaishankar tweeted after the meeting.Le Drian will also participate in a panel discussion on climate change along with environment and climate change minister Prakash Javadekar. In the second leg of his tour, he will visit the National Centre for Biological Sciences and the Indian Space Research Organisation in Bengaluru on April 15.During an event held at the French embassy, Le Drian appointed 15 “alumni ambassadors” from the France Alumni network to boost student mobility between the two countries. He later interacted with French and Indian producers to boost bilateral cooperation in movies and television and to promote gender equality in cinema.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-france-discuss-boosting-cooperation-greater-collaboration-in-diverse-sectors-101618336363716.html

"We hope some more vaccine centres will be re- activated on Wednesday after receiving new stock," he said.The Tika Ustav, which is going on for four days from April 11 to April 14, will end on Wednesday, he said, adding that the state has so far vaccinated 45,85,049 persons.On April 3, Odisha held 1476 vaccination sessions and vaccinated the highest ever 2,71,480 beneficiaries in a single day. However, since then due to short and uncertain supply of vaccines from MoHFW, the state has been forced to close vaccination centres, the minister said.Meanwhile, keeping in view the spike of cases, the Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation, Cuttack Municipal Corporation and some other district authorities have imposed restriction on observation of "Maha Bishuva Sankranti" and other festivals in order to avoid large gatherings.An official of Shree Jagannath Temple Administration (SJTA) Tuesday said that at least 23 people associated with the Puri temple activities are identified as Covid-19 positive.Odisha's Covid-19 tally surged to 3,53,086 on Tuesday as 1,784 more people tested positive for the infection, while two fresh fatalities pushed the state's coronavirus death toll to 1,930, a health official said.The state on Tuesday registered recovery of 523 patients taking the total number of cured persons to 3,41,123 which is 96.61 per cent of the caseload.Odisha's case fatality ratio(CFR) stands at 0.54 per cent while active cases percentage is 2.82 per cent, an official data said.

13-04-2021||India||Violent protests in Pak cities cast shadow over visit by 800 Sikh pilgrims||Escalating protests by a hardline religious group in several Pakistani cities have cast a shadow over a visit to the neighbouring country by more than 800 Indian Sikh pilgrims to participate in the annual Baisakhi festival, people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.A total of 818 Indian pilgrims were briefly stranded in Lahore, the capital of Pakistan’s Punjab province, on Monday after they crossed the border at Wagah. The group left Lahore late on Tuesday afternoon for the city of Hasan Abdal, where they will join celebrations at Gurdwara Panja Sahib, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity.The arrival of the Sikh jatha in Pakistan coincided with violent protests in several cities, including Lahore, Islamabad and Karachi, by Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) against the arrest of the group’s chief Allama Saad Hussain Rizvi. TLP is also pressuring the Pakistan government to act on its demands, including the expulsion of the French envoy and a ban on French imports, over the publication of blasphemous caricatures in France.At least three people have died in the protests, including a police constable who was beaten to death during a clash in Lahore on Tuesday. Videos emerged from several places that showed paramilitary troops backing the protestors. The Pakistan government has not shown any intention of dispersing the demonstrators.“There are concerns that the Indian pilgrims could be stranded in Hasan Abdal if the protests become more violent. The protests have already disrupted the movement of vehicles between cities such as Lahore, Islamabad and Rawalpindi,” said one of the people cited above.The Indian pilgrims are scheduled to visit gurdwaras at several locations, including Gurdwara Janamsthan at Nankana Sahib, after the clebrations in Hasan Abdal.Baisakhi is a spring harvest festival that marks the Sikh new year and commemorates the formation of the Khalsa Panth under Guru Gobind Singh in 1699. Gurdwara Panja Sahib at Hasan Abdal, about 350 km from Lahore, is believed to have the hand print of Guru Nanak, the founder of Sikhism. The main event of the Baisakhi celebrations will be held at Hasan Abdal on April 14.Sikhs from India travel to Hasan Abdal every year to celebrate the festival.The Indian pilgrims were initially stranded at the Wagah border crossing till 9.30 pm on Monday because of the violent protests.“We spent the whole day in buses, though arrangements for food and water were made for us. After Pakistan’s police and security forces got the roads cleared, we were taken to Gurdwara Dehra Sahib in Lahore at 11.30 pm on Monday,” said Gurdev Singh, one of the pilgrims.Singh said the original plan was for the pilgrims to travel directly to Hasan Abdal, without any stopover in Lahore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/violent-protests-in-pak-cities-cast-shadow-over-visit-by-800-sikh-pilgrims-101618334742530.html

Section 144, which restricts the gathering of more than four or five people, will be imposed in the state for the next 15 days, Uddhav Thackeray announced.Public transport like aeroplanes, trains, taxis, autos and buses are categorised as essential and will remain operational for essential service workers during the restrictions effective from Wednesday 8pm till May 1 7am. According to the guidelines, no one will be allowed to be in a public place without any valid reason. All establishments, public place activities and services will remain closed. Services and activities under the essential category will be exempted.Also Read | No lockdown, Section 144 across Maharashtra from tomorrow: Uddhav ThackerayDuring his address to the state, the chief minister said the Covid-19 situation in the state is dreadful and it was time to take strict measures. “We are facing a shortage of oxygen, beds.

13-04-2021||India||Migrants workers head back to villagers but no fear of Covid-19 this time||Even though there is an unusual rush of people across interstate bus stations and railway stations, most of the migrants said they were going back to their villages for harvest season, festivals and local body polls in Uttar Pradesh with some admitting that they feared a complete lockdown.In Mumbai, amid talk of a complete lockdown to arrest the Covid-19 surge, the passenger rush on outstation trains in Mumbai has increased since the last weekend, Railway officials said on Tuesday, attributing the increase to the summer season during which a large number of people travel to their native places.“Trains were completely full but since the last few days there has been more rush,” said a Railway official at Mumbai’s Lokmanya Tilak Terminus.The officials familiar with the developments said the rush on outstation trains has gone up since the state government announced fresh Covid-19 curbs earlier this month, the weekend saw a steady flow of passengers on long-distance trains originating from different stations in the metropolis.Speculation is rife about the Maharashtra government mulling a “complete lockdown” to curb the current surge in Covid-19 cases. The state registered an all-time high spike of 63,294 infections on Sunday.“Panchayat elections are scheduled in Uttar Pradesh and hence many people are going for voting,” he said, adding there may be some migrant labourers among the passengers but their number is “negligible” as compared to the last year.A Central Railway spokesperson said they are operating 12 of the 88 scheduled summer special trains for North India, apart from 18-20 regular special trains for Darbhanga, Patna, Danapur, Gorakhpur, Lucknow, Manduadih, Puri, Raxaul and Guwahati, among other destinations.“The Railway administration appeals to people to avoid panic booking. The Railway runs more trains in summer for the convenience of passengers,” Shivaji Sutar, chief public relations officer, Central Railway, said.At Delhi’s Anand Vihar and Kaushambi inter-state bus terminals, there has been a rise in the footfall of passengers travelling between Delhi-NCR and Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand and Uttarakhand.“Many workers in the car spare parts manufacturing factory in Gurugram where I work were discussing for the last two days that the government will impose lockdown and the factory will be closed. It may be all rumours. But it’s better to return now than facing the situation that we witnessed last year. We will return to Delhi on April 22 if there is no lockdown,” said Sundaram Singh, who was returning to his village in Gorakhpur with his wife, Ritu Singh, and two children.Also read: India Covid-19 second wave has crossed previous spike, worrying - GovtWaiting at the Anand Vihar interstate bus terminals with five other relatives for a bus to her hometown in Uttar Pradesh’s Hardoi, Rameshwari, a 45-year-old woman who lives with her family in Faridabad and works as domestic help, said that their travel had nothing to do anything with the fear of rising Covid-19 cases.“One Pappu from our village is contesting the elections for the post of Gram Pradhan. He had been continuously requesting our presence to vote for him. He has agreed to bear all our travel expenses. As we depend on our pradhan for many of our works, we have to support him during the voting. We will return after the elections,” said Rameshwari.A police officer from the Patparganj Industrial Area police station, who did not want to be named, said that they have also been monitoring the situation and the police personnel on field duty have been speaking to the passengers about their purpose of visiting their hometown.“We have hardly come across any family who was leaving the city because of the Covid cases. Some did mention the lockdown anticipation but even they did not cite it as the reason for their travel,” the officer said, adding that they have been telling passengers not to believe any rumours and report to the police if they see anyone spreading the lies.In Ludhiana, which witnessed a huge exodus of workers last year during the lockdown, industry owners and workers said there was no fear of Covid-19 pushing the workers to return to their villages.According to Onkar Singh Pahwa, chairman and managing director of Avon Cycles, there is no shortage of workers. “The labour is not going anywhere in large numbers. The ones who went back are those who go to their villages for reasons of harvesting at this time of the year every year,” said Pahwa. DS Chawla, president, United Cycle Parts Manufacturers Association (UCPMA) said there is no such shortage or reverse influx of labour is happening in Ludhiana.Rajesh Aggarwal, divisional railway manager, Ferozpur division said that there is no rush of passengers or labourers on railway stations across Ferozpur division. The railway officials are allowing only those passengers to board the trains who have confirmed RAC tickets and are following the Covid-19 protocols, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/migrants-workers-head-back-to-villagers-but-no-fear-of-covid-19-this-time-101618328922371.html

PM Modi said the pandemic has presented opportunity to reshape the world order and reorient our thinking as he inaugurated the sixth edition of the Raisina Dialogue.“This edition of Raisina Dialogue takes a place at a watershed moment in human history. A global pandemic has been ravaging the world for over a year. The last such global pandemic was a century ago,” PM Modi said during his addresses at the inaugural session of Raisina Dialogue. “During this pandemic, in our own humble way and within our own limited resources, we in India have tried to walk the talk. We have tried to protect our own 1.3 billion citizens from the pandemic. At the same time, we have also tried to support pandemic response efforts of others,” he added."We understand fully that mankind will not defeat the pandemic unless all of us, everywhere, regardless of the colour of our passports, come out of it. That is why, this year, despite many constraints, we have supplied vaccines to over 80 countries," the Prime Minister said.The four-day Raisina Dialogue is being held virtually this time due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. It is India’s flagship conference on geopolitics and geoeconomics and is being hosted by the think tank Observer Research Foundation (ORF) in partnership with the ministry of external affairs (MEA).

13-04-2021||India||Goa Forward Party quits NDA citing BJP’s ‘incompetence’ under CM Pramod Sawant||The Goa Forward Party formally exited the National Democratic Alliance on Tuesday-- one and a half year after it withdrew support from the Pramod Sawant led BJP government, following the sacking of its ministers—and alleged that the ruling party was no longer the same after former chief minister and defence minister Manohar Parrikar’s death. It wrote a letter to Amit Shah announcing “the termination of our participation in the NDA.”“Under the late Manohar Parrikar, the BJP used to be a party with a difference, and under Pramod Sawant it is a different party—an anti-Goan party,” party supremo Vijai Sardesai said in his letter to Union home minister Amit Shah.“During the peak of the Pandemic, the nation saw how little the BJP government in Goa cared and how incompetent it was in tackling the rising cases, consistently flouting all norms and protocols under the illusion of generating income.’ In just two years, the NDA has miserably failed the people of Goa, under the leadership of the BJP,” Sardesai said, and added, “The GFP is out of the NDA forever, and we will never look back.”GFP was part of the Parrikar government between March 2017 and July 2019 and was dumped after 10 Congress MLAs switched sides to the BJP. Out in the cold since then, it is now looking to join hands with the Congress in the state. However, the party’s continuation in the NDA was cited as a sticking point within a faction in the Congress.Sardesai’s Goa Forward Party, formed before the 2017 general assembly elections, fought the then BJP government, winning two of its three seats against sitting BJP ministers. However, after the election, it made an about-turn and pledged support to the BJP, keeping the single-largest party, the Congress away from power. In return, Sardesai and two other party MLAs were made ministers in the Manohar Parrikar government and continued to enjoy their position even when Pramod Sawant took over as the CM after Parrikar’s death in March 2019. However, they were dropped three months later in July 2019 after 10 MLAs of the Congress en masse switched to the BJP. Sardesai soon withdrew support from the Sawant-led government but stayed in the NDA.“Since July 2019, the state leadership of the Bharatiya Janata Party in Goa has turned its back on the people of Goa who looked ahead with hope to the prospect of all-around development of our beloved state. The unfortunate demise of Manohar Parrikar brought Goa to despair, while ushering in a period of rampant corruption and dishonesty with the elevation of Shri Pramod Sawant as the 13th Chief Minister of Goa,” said Sardesai.“The NDA remains an umbrella for all like minded parties led by the BJP and remains strong as ever. It is their decision if they want to quit the NDA and we have nothing to say,” Bharatiya Janata Party spokesperson and former Parliamentarian Narendra Sawaikar said.Despite Sardesai now angling for an alliance with the Congress ahead of the upcoming polls, a faction in the Congress is said to be dead against such an alliance, still peeved at the ‘betrayal’. The party was guarded in its official reaction to the developments.“The dynamics of politics is changing. People in future will prefer only those with integrity, commitment and loyalty to a particular cause or ideology. The days of turncoats and party hoppers are long over which has hurt Goa very badly,” state president Girish Chodankar said.“The Congress party is building up our grassroots organisation & we will surely win the trust of the people,” he added.An independent political observer, Mayabhushan Nagvenkar, who co-authored a book on Manohar Parrikar, said Sardesai’s party’s exit from the NDA ahead of a municipal poll only goes to show how desperate the regional party was to salvage its reputation in a municipal poll by aligning with Congress-sponsored candidates.“In Goa’s notoriously fluid politics, the NDA label which the Goa Forward formally sported until now, was only a foot in the door which had closed on the party in 2019.

With this poll, his party has emerged as the second biggest political force in the state, barely two years before the state goes to assembly polls. Pradyot resigned from the Congress in 2019 and floated TIPRA Motha this year with the chief promise of forming a Greater Tipraland by including indigenous population living outside the TTAADC region in Tripura and other Indian states like, Assam, Mizoram and some parts of neighbouring country Bangladesh.TIPRA won 18 of the 28 TTAADC seats that went to polls on April 6, leaving the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the second position with nine seats. One seat was won by an independent. Results were declared on April 10. Over 85 % turnout was recorded in the polling. The TTAADC, formed in 1982, covers close to 70% of Tripura’s geographical area and over 30% of the state’s population.BJP had earlier said that the party didn’t field enough candidates in the council polls to get majority of its own. The BJP fought the polls in alliance with the Indigenous People’s Front of Tripura (IPFT), which failed to get even a single seat.An independent political analyst said that TIPRA’s rise was partly due to the charisma enjoyed by royals such as its leader and partly due to the search for an alternative political force. ” Generally, it is seen that the ruling party in the state wins any kind of local polls. But this district council polls came with a different result. It happened partly due to charisma of the royals among the indigenous people and secondly, since they wanted an alternative to the CPM and the BJP,” he said.The council polls were scheduled for May last year but were postponed due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Governor RK Bais acted as its administrator in the interim.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tripura-pradyot-kishore-to-take-oath-as-autonomous-council-chief-on-april-20-101618323642347.html

These officers have been in contact with me, so I have isolated myself as a precaution and am starting all the work virtually," Adityanath said in a tweet in Hindi.Adityanath, however, did not identify the officials who tested positive. The development comes shortly after Adityanath wrapped up his extensive campaign for the West Bengal assembly elections, where he was one of the star campaigners for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Some officials, including his OSD Abhishek Kaushik, tested positive for the coronavirus disease, reported news agency PTI.The Uttar Pradesh government has already announced restrictions on gatherings of five or more people in religious places for effective control of the Covid-19 pandemic during Navratri and Ramadan. Uttar Pradesh on Tuesday reported the highest-ever single-day spike of 18,021 coronavirus cases and 85 deaths, a senior official said. With this, the state's infection tally stands at 7,23,582 and the death toll at 9,309.

The state has reported a total of 9,309 deaths since the start of the pandemic," Amit Mohan Prasad, additional chief secretary (health), said.Witnessing a record surge in infections, the Yogi Adityanath government has imposed a night curfew in all districts with more than 500 active cases and also ordered the closure of schools and coaching from class 1 to 12 in the state till April 30.Earlier in the day, Union health ministry secretary Rajesh Bhushan flagged the spike seen in cases of Covid-19 in Uttar Pradesh where the infections have shot up from an average of 89 cases per day to 10,000 cases a day. "Average tests per million are increasing but not at the corresponding rate of cases. The average RT-PCR test is 45 per cent and it has to be ramped up. The weekly positivity rate is below 5 per cent but it is showing a rising trend," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/up-cm-yogi-adityanath-self-isolates-after-officials-test-positive-for-covid19-101618321647691.html

13-04-2021||India||Assam: Congress ally BPF’s candidates holed up in Chhattisgarh resort||Eight candidates of Bodoland Peoples’ Front (BPF) who contested the recently concluded assembly polls in Assam were moved to a resort in Chhattisgarh on Saturday amid horse-trading speculations, said a senior Congress leader. BPF is the second among the national party’s regional allies to have moved candidates to a Congress-ruled state.BPF, which was part of the ruling BJP-led coalition in Assam, tied up with Congress’s 10-party ‘mahajot’ (grand alliance) for the elections and fielded 12 candidates.“The BPF candidates were brought to Chhattisgarh on Saturday and were staying at the Mayfair Lake Resort in Raipur. They were likely to stay there till May 2 when counting of votes takes place,” said a senior Chhattisgarh Congress leader refusing to be named.“BJP are past masters at the game of manipulation in their lust for power. We have seen many instances in past where they have used all kinds of means to lure away elected representatives. This time if we have taken pre-emptive measures to prevent something like that from happening, what’s the harm?” questioned Assam Congress leader and Lok Sabha MP Pradyut Bordoloi.BPF spokesperson Khampa Borgoyary said party candidates were on a “vacation”.“Our candidates have gone outside the state for a vacation after the long Bodoland Territorial Council (BTC) polls which was followed by the assembly elections. BJP has a track record of horse-trading and could try to indulge in it this time as well. But there’s no chance of our candidates switching sides,” the spokesperson said.Chhattisgarh chief minister Bhupesh Baghel, who was the Congress election observer for Assam, spent several weeks in the state preparing the party’s strategy for the polls. HT earlier reported about BPF candidates being taken outside the state. The ruling BJP alliance and the opposition Congress-led coalition are locked in a direct fight for power in Assam. The three-phased elections for the 126-member assembly concluded on April 6. In 2016, BJP won 60 seats and formed its first government in Assam with support of Asom Gana Parishad (AGP) (14) and BPF (12). On the other hand, Congress won 26 seats and the AIUDF bagged 13.“The fact that Congress is moving candidates of its allies to states outside Assam shows they don’t have any trust in them. BJP is not bothered with these antics as we are forming the next government with a comfortable majority,” BJP spokesperson Subhash Dutta said.The BPF suffered a setback even before polling when Rangja Khungur Basumatary, the party candidate from the Tamulpur seat retired from the contest six days prior to the third phase of polling and joined the BJP.BPF, which ruled the Bodoland Territorial Council (BTC) for 17 years, has a strong presence in the four BTR districts. The party is expected to see a keen contest with United Peoples’ Party Liberal (UPPL), which is now heading the council with support of BJP.On April 9, three days after the end of polling for the third phase, AIUDF, which is also part of the Congress-led alliance and contested 20 seats, took 18 of their candidates to Rajasthan, another Congress-ruled state, said AIUDF organising secretary Md. Aminul Islam.While pilgrimage to Ajmer Sharif Dargah was stated as the reason for the trip, party leaders admitted that fear of their candidates being ‘influenced’ by the BJP ahead of counting prompted the move.Akhil Ranjan Dutta, professor of political science at Gauhati University said these instances did not augur well for the democratic process. “These incidents are not good for a democracy and a tremendous insult on conscience of voters. Such events happening even before the counting of votes could also lead to young voters, who are careful observers of the political process in Assam, losing faith in the election process, ” he said.(With inputs from Ritesh Mishra in Raipur)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-congress-ally-bpf-s-candidates-holed-up-in-chhattisgarh-resort-101618319381959.html

He also held discussions with political leaders including those from Opposition parties, and with members of industries. We tried a weekend lockdown, night curfew and other measures. We will come up with fresh guidelines today to break the chain of coronavirus. There will be a standard operating procedure for the entire state, which will be announced (on Tuesday) itself," he said.Addressing an all-party meeting last week, CM Thackeray had hinted at the imposition of an extended lockdown in the state to curb the surge in cases.Read more: Sanjay Raut blames Centre for rising Covid-19 cases in Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, PunjabState public health minister Rajesh Tope said the lockdown is inevitable, but the government was tapping the ways to reduce its impact. “We held a couple of meetings with various departments on Monday...

Besides the food, the period will also be utilised for the augmentation of the health infrastructure,” he said, adding that the people will be given ample time to prepare for the lockdown.Maharashtra had reported the highest 63,294 infections on Sunday, but the cases dropped significantly to 51,751 on Monday, apparently due to a lesser number of tests conducted over the weekend, taking the tally to 34,58,996.

The move comes a day after videos of victims’ bodies piled up in a hospital went viral even as the state remains among the top eight states in the country where the second wave has surpassed the peak in the first wave last year.Grappling with the sudden rise in cases as well as fatalities, the administration has also taken measures such as reserving beds and capping treatment costs for Covid patients in private hospitals amid challenges such as RT-PCR results taking over 40 hours, said officials.On Sunday, videos circulated on social media showed bodies of Covid-19 patients piled up in Ambedkar Hospital in Raipur, reflecting the alarming situation. District health officials attributed the lapse to an “unexpected sudden rise” in the number of deaths.“Patients of multiple ailments, including coronavirus, are treated in Dr Bhimrao Ambedkar Memorial Hospital (DBRMAH). Bodies of non-Covid patients are also kept in the mortuary there. Among the deaths, there are also patients who belonged to other districts and their bodies are kept in mortuary too before being shifted to respective areas,” said Pulak Bhattacharya, additional commissioner Raipur Municipal Corporation (RMC). On Monday, there were 40 bodies, mostly of Covid victims, in the mortuary of DBRAMH, which was more than its capacity, he added.“For the last two days, 100 bodies have been cremated daily in Raipur. We have also increased the number of hearses so that bodies can be shifted to crematorium without any delay,” he added.On Monday, 18 Covid deaths were reported at DBRMAH, 11 at All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) Raipur and over 60 at private hospitals. Apart from the 14 new cremation centres, Raipur administration has also begun identifying new cremation grounds in every 8-10 villages to deal with the increasing death toll, according to the health department bulletin.On Monday , Chhattisgarh recorded 13,576 fresh cases, including 3,442 and 1,591 in the two worst-hit districts of Raipur and Durg respectively, while the state-wide death toll mounted to 5,031. This is the sixth consecutive day when the state has recorded more than 10,000 daily cases, taking active Covid cases to 98,856. Tuesday figures were not available on the state health department’s official website at the time of publishing of the report.Health officials said there were 4,051 beds in 33 dedicated Covid hospitals in the state, which includes 1,341 beds with oxygen facility, 438 HDU (high dependency unit) and 440 ICU (intensive care unit) beds.“The occupancy in dedicated Covid hospitals in Raipur and Durg is more than 95%,” said a senior health official.Besides these, there are 70 Covid care centres with more than 10,000 beds, including 1,087 beds with oxygen facilities, and 3,134 beds, including 1,052 with oxygen facilities in private hospitals.In areas of challenge, RT-PCR test results in the state were taking more than 40 hours in most of the districts, said a health official, who didn’t wish to be named. The health department claimed that more than 40,000 Covid tests were being conducted every day on an average across the state. They said on Saturday, the number of samples tested crossed 50,000, while on Monday, 45,997 tests were conducted. There was a backlog of around 10,000 tests, they added.On Monday, the Chhattisgarh government fixed a rate slab for treatment of Covid-19 patients, ranging from ₹6,200 to ₹17,000 a day in private hospitals, depending on their condition.“ ₹6,200 per day will be the cost of treatment of patients with moderate condition, ₹12,000 per day for ICU facility without ventilator for patients in critical condition and ₹17,000 per day including ICU facility with ventilator for very serious patients,” a government issued press release stated.It also reserved 20% of the beds in private hospitals for Covid-19 patients, taking treatment under the Dr Khubchand Baghel health scheme and Ayushman Bharat Scheme.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/record-132-covid-deaths-in-chhattisgarh-on-monday-new-cremation-grounds-opened-101618316201760.html
13-04-2021||India||India Covid-19 second wave has crossed previous spike, worrying: Govt||The Centre on Tuesday said the second wave of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) has crossed the previous highest surge and the upward trend of the infections is a cause of concern.Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan pointed out that the trend in India's Covid-19 cases trajectory in the second wave is "worrying"."We have 89.51% people who have been cured, 1.25% deaths and 9.24% active cases. If we look at new cases, we will find that the previous highest surge has already been crossed and the trend is going upward. That is a cause for worry," Bhushan said during a press conference.The top health ministry official added that the daily Covid-19 deaths recorded in the country are registering an increasing trend but is yet to cross the highest toll seen during India's first wave last year."However, the previous surge's highest point was 1114 and presently we have reported 879 deaths," Bhushan was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.India still has more than 1.67 crore Covid-19 vaccine doses still available with states and UTs, the Centre said on Tuesday, underlining that the problem is not of vaccine shortage but of better planning.Bhushan said so far states and UTs have received 13,10,90,370 vaccine doses, out of which the total consumption, including wastage, has been 11,43,69,677."As per 11 am data, unutilised doses available with states and union territories for administration is 1,67,20,693. From now till April end, 2,01,22,960 doses are in supply pipeline to states and UTs," he said.Providing the data from states where the infection is showing rapid growth despite low testing through RTPCR, the health secretary said that there the ministry has a reason to believe that if RT-PCR tests proportion goes up, then positivity may show a corresponding increase."In Maharashtra, you'll find that average daily cases, week on week, have grown significantly and reached a level of 57,000 plus. Tests per million are also growing but not keeping pace with the growth of average daily cases. If you look at the share of RT-PCR tests, it's progressively coming down," he said.Bhushan said that the weekly positivity rate in Chattisgarh is also increasing from one and a half percent, it has increased to 27.9 per cent, and added that this is another cause for concern.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-covid-19-second-wave-has-crossed-previous-spike-worrying-govt-101618312914477.html

All you need to know||Kerala minister KT Jaleel resigned on Tuesday from the Pinarayi Vijayan cabinet, days after the state Lokayukta held him accountable for 'abuse of power' as a public servant to obtain a favour for a relative. The minister's resignation letter has been forwarded to the Kerala chief minister and the governor, PTI reported, citing sources in the chief minister's office (CMO). Simultaneously, the development was also confirmed by the minister himself, in a post on his personal Facebook account.Jaleel, who held the the portfolios for higher education, minority welfare, Waqf and Hajj, in the Left Democratic Front (LDF)-led ministry, moved Kerala High Court on Monday, seeking a stay on the Lokayukta report which held him guilty of abusing his position of authority. Kerala law minister AK Balan also backed Jaleel on Saturday, according to a PTI report, pointing out that he did not need to resign immediately and has several legal options left, including an appeal at the high court to get the Lokayukta order stayed. However, Jaleel announced his resignation from the Kerala cabinet on Tuesday. ”Those who wanted to suck my blood can rest for now,” KT Jaleel said. Claiming that he was been subjected to an "unjust and constant witch hunt" on part of the "media syndicate", Jaleel wrote on Facebook, "I have handed over my resignation to the chief minister."Here's the controversy surrounding Kerala minister KT Jaleel:What are the charges against KT Jaleel?The chief allegations levelled against KT Jaleel concern the appointment of his cousin KT Adeeb as the general manager of the Kerala State Minorities Development Finance Corporation Limited in 2018. Adeeb, the manager of a private bank when the appointment was made, was allegedly named for his new post flouting all relevant rules.Although Adeeb was later forced to resign, the Muslim Youth League filed a complaint against KT Jaleel in November that year, alleging 'nepotism' and 'favouritism' on part of the minister in appointing his relative for the post.Although Adeeb was later forced to resigned, the Muslim Youth League filed a complaint against KT Jaleel in November that year, alleging 'nepotism' and 'favouritism' on part of the minister in appointing his relative for the post.KT Jaleel was also questioned several times by central agencies in connection with the import of dry dates and holy books. After the gold smuggling case involving the consulate of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) came to light last year Jaleel was questioned by the customs and the Enforcement Directorate on several occasions. Trouble began for him after phone call records of Swapna Suresh, the main accused in the gold smuggling case, were leaked to the media. The minister’s phone number figured prominently in the list.How did KT Jaleel try to defend the charges?In his Facebook post on Tuesday, KT Jaleel said that the Muslim Youth League has been "after him" right since 2006, following his win from the Kuttipuram assembly constituency. He also blamed a “media syndicate” for subjecting him to a "witch hunt" over the last several days. This, he said, was the conspiracy of an "anti-leftist alliance" consisting of the Muslim League, Congress, and "right-wing media". Even after three central investigation agencies probed his case, they have managed to find zero evidence of error, he said. "Any investigating agency, including media teams, are still welcome to my home a thousand times more," he said.എൻ്റെ രക്തം ഊറ്റിക്കുടിക്കാൻ വെമ്പുന്നവർക്ക് തൽക്കാലം ആശ്വസിക്കാം. രാജിക്കത്ത് മുഖ്യമന്ത്രിക്ക് കൈമാറിയ വിവരം...After the phone call records of Swapna Suresh was revealed last year, KT Jaleel said that he called Suresh, a consular employee, in connection with Ramadan kits offered by the UAE consulate in the state capital. But the minister’s clarification invited more trouble for him as he was not supposed to accept any funds or freebies without the consent of the ministry of external affairs and experts said it was a clear violation of the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA). During the gold smuggling investigation, the customs also found that a heavy consignment came in last March in 31 bags, weighing more than 4000kg and they were taken to Malappuram. The minister later admitted that he took these packets to his constituency but said they were religious books.What did the Kerala Lokayukta find in KT Jaleel's case?The Kerala Lokayukta on Friday found the Kerala minister guilty of abuse of power, favouritism and violation of oath of office and ruled that he has no right to continue in the council of ministers. Presided over by Justice Cyriac Joseph and Justice Harun-al-Rasheed, the Lokayukta verdict read, "The action of the respondent (Jaleel) was actuated in a discharge of his function as minister by personal interest to favour his second cousin. It amounted to favouritism and nepotism and also lack of integrity in his capacity as the minister." It also said he diluted qualifications and norms for the post just to favour his kin.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kt-jaleel-quits-kerala-cabinet-here-s-all-you-need-to-know-101618303056899.html

"This is applicable for the areas where night curfew is already imposed," the statement from CMO said.The state has imposed a night curfew in Dehradun from 10pm to 5am to combat Covid-19. The state cabinet decided to shut schools for classes 1 to 12 in Dehradun, Haldwani, and Haridwar till April 30.The decision to relax the curbs in the state comes as the country celebrates Hindu festival of Chaitra Navratri or Vasant Navratri during the spring season in India. It is considered to be an important nine-day celebration for the Hindu community.This year Chaitra Navratri is being celebrated from April 13 to April 22.

Now, there is a sudden rush of bodies. At present, we are handling about 100 bodies per day," Kamlesh Sailor, president of a trust which manages the crematorium, told PTI.Sailor said six gas furnaces at their facility are now being operated 24 hours and hence, the temperature there reaches up to 600 degrees Celsius.As a result, the iron frames and chimneys have started melting and breaking due to the heat, he said, adding that mechanics are being called to replace those parts.The Ashvini Kumar Crematorium, the oldest such facility in Surat, is also facing similar issues and its management has decided to increase the number of traditional wood pyres to manage the rush of bodies in case of maintenance issues in the gas furnaces."We operate 10 gas furnaces and three wood pyres. Earlier, we used to cremate about 30 bodies every day. Now, the number has gone up to 90-95," the crematorium's manager, Prashant Kabrawala, said.Since the furnaces are being operated round-the-clock, some of their iron frames have melted due to overheating. Some pipes and chimney joints have also broken because of the excessive heat generated in the facility, he said."We recently installed heat-resistant bricks in two of our furnaces, which were shut for some time. Our maintenance engineers are visiting the crematorium almost daily as we are facing these issues every day," he said.Kabrawala said they have decided to add two more wood pyres in the wake of these frequent maintenance issues.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-frames-of-crematorium-furnaces-melt-due-to-rush-of-bodies-in-gujarat-101618306897681.html
13-04-2021||India||Kerala minister KT Jaleel quits four days after Lokayutka’s ‘guilty’ verdict||Kerala higher education minister KT Jaleel (53) resigned from the Pinarayi Vijayan cabinet on Monday, four days after the Lokayukta found him guilty of abuse of power and favouritism, ruling he had no moral right to continue as a minister.“For the last two years I have been hounded by certain people and a section of the media. They will be happy (that) I have tendered my resignation. But I will bounce back. They can kill me but they can’t defeat me,” the minister posted a message on Facebook, announcing his decision on Tuesday. The term of the present Kerala government will end soon after the results of the assembly elections held on April 6 are announced on May 2. Jaleel contested the polls from Thavanoor seat in Malappuram this time.His resignation came while the Kerala high court heard his plea to stay the anti-corruption body’s verdict. He had filed the plea despite legal experts’ advice to quit and not challenge the Lokayukta order, people close to the former minister said on condition of anonymity.The case dates back to 2018, when Jaleel appointed his second cousin K T Adeeb as the general manager of the Kerala State Minorities Development Finance Corporation Limited, flouting all norms. Later, his kin was forced to resign following a big uproar against the appointment. V K Mohammad Shafi, a supporter of the Muslim League, soon filed a complaint with the Lokayukta over the issue, resulting in the verdict against Jaleel on Friday.“The action of the respondent (Jaleel) was actuated in discharge of his function as a minister by personal interest to favour his second cousin. It amounted to favouritism and nepotism and also lack of integrity in his capacity as the minister,” said the verdict of the Lokayukta, presided over by justices Cyriac Joseph and Harun-al-Rasheed. The body also said the minister diluted qualifications and norms for appointment to the post just to favour his kin.The ruling Communist Party of India (Marxist), popularly known as the CPM said Jaleel resigned to uphold high morality. “We are unlike Congress leaders who always cling on to power despite court verdicts,” said party’s acting secretary A Vijayaraghavan.The opposition Congress responded by saying Jaleel lost the right to cite morality. “The party disowned him when all doors were shut before him. It is better late than never,” said opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala. The BJP has also welcomed his resignation.Jaleel was also questioned several times recently by the customs and the Enforcement Directorate in connection with the case of gold and dollar smuggling through the United Arab Emirates (UAE) consulate in the state capital.The minister’s phone number figured prominently in the leaked phone call records of the main accused in the gold smuggling case, Swapna Suresh. Jaleel claimed he called Suresh, a consular employee, in connection with Ramadan kits offered by the UAE consulate last year. His clarification caused him more trouble as he was not supposed to accept any funds or freebies without the consent of the ministry of external affairs. Experts said his conduct was a clear violation of the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA). The customs also linked him to a heavy consignment, in 31 bags, weighing more than 4,000 kg that arrived from UAE on March 4, 2020. Jaleel claimed the packets contained religious books, which he took to his constituency of Malappuram. He was also linked to the import of about 17,000 kg dry dates between 2017 and 2018.From the Muslim-majority district of Malappuram, Jaleel was considered close to CM Vijayan, who earlier protected him in a controversy over mark donation to a failed student during his tenure as the higher education minister in 2018 .A good orator, Jaleel started his political career with the banned Islamic Students Movement of India (SIMI) before moving to the Muslim Youth League, youth outfit of the Muslim League. He later fell out with his mentor P K Kunhalikutty, former minister, and defeated him as an Independent with the support of the LDF. He was backed by the CPI(M) and returned the favour by attracting many disgruntled Muslim leaders to the party fold.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-minister-kt-jaleel-quits-four-days-after-lokayutka-s-guilty-verdict-101618307201128.html
13-04-2021||India||Chhattisgarh: Morgues overflow with bodies of Covid-19 victims||Bodies of Covid-19 victims have been piling up in mortuaries and crematoriums in Raipur, as the Chhattisgarh administration struggles to deal with the sudden surge in cases of the viral infection and fatalities.In some videos on social media, bodies were seen lying on stretchers outside the mortuary of Raipur's Dr B R Ambedkar Memorial Hospital (DBRAMH), the state's biggest government-run hospital, and last rites of victims being performed from morning till late night in crematoriums here.Talking to PTI on Tuesday, state Health Minister T S Singh Deo said the overall situation is "very concerning" and the sudden rise in Covid-19 cases and deaths has posed a challenge for authorities."The district administration and the municipal corporation have been asked to ensure the bodies are cremated at the earliest," he said.The situation was also grim in neighbouring Durg district.Since April 1, 861 people have died due to Covid-19 in Chhattisgarh, with Raipur reporting 305 fatalities and Durg 213, as per official data.The minister said there is generally no delay in the cremation of bodies of Covid-19 victims belonging to Raipur.But, for victims hailing from other districts who succumbed in hospitals here, it takes some time for completing the process of shifting the bodies to their respective places, he said.An official from the Raipur Municipal Corporation official said since the last couple of days, the last rites of about 100 victims were being performed every day in crematoriums and burial grounds here.Patients with various ailments, including Covid-19, were being treated in the DBRMAH. The bodies of non-Covid patients and those related to medico-legal cases were also kept in the hospital's mortuary, Raipur's Additional Municipal Commissioner Pulak Bhattacharya said.The bodies of victims hailing from other districts were are kept in the Raipur hospital's mortuary before being shifted to their native places, he said."Due to a sudden spike in deaths due to Covid-19, the bodies piled up in the mortuary," Bhattacharya said.On Monday, the hospital's morgue had 40 bodies, mostly of Covid-19 victims, which was more than its capacity, he said."Since the last two days, the last rites of nearly 100 victims were being performed per day in Raipur. We have pressed more hearses into service so that the bodies can be shifted to crematoriums without any delay," he said.Till about a fortnight back, the bodies of Covid-19 victims were disposed of only in two crematoriums in Raipur, but now the district administration has ordered to use all 18 crematoriums and burial grounds falling under the city civic limits for the purpose, he said.Crematoriums on the outskirts of Raipur have also been identified, the official said.During the first wave of Covid-19 last year, 10 crematoriums and burial grounds were being used in Raipur for the last rites of the victims, he added.A process was underway to set up more electric crematoriums in Raipur and other cities, another official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chhattisgarh-morgues-overflow-with-bodies-of-covid-19-victims-101618304195978.html

"Given the unprecedented demand for the drug, we have now further ramped up our capacities through our network."The company is working with authorities to restrict Remdesivir supply just to hospitals and places with a high burden of severe Covid-19 cases, it added.Just two months ago, Cipla had projected falling demand for Remdesivir in India as coronavirus infections were on a steady decline.The World Health Organization in November issued a conditional recommendation against the use of Remdesivir in hospitalised patients, saying there was no evidence that the drug improved survival and other outcomes. Still, many countries, including India, have continued its use.Cipla, one of India's oldest and largest drug manufacturers, has a deal to make and supply US-based Gilead's Remdesivir in more than 100 countries. Several other Indian drug producers also have similar agreements.Cipla also warned that it was facing a shortage of tocilizumab, an arthritis drug developed by Roche that has been shown in trials to reduce the risk of death in patients with severe Covid-19."We expect intermittent supplies (of tocilizumab) as demand outstrips supply," Cipla said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/unprecedented-demand-cipla-doubles-remdesivir-output-as-covid-19-cases-surge-101618302390422.html

13-04-2021||India||Monsoon likely to be normal for third consecutive year: Skymet Weather||Monsoon is likely to be normal or above normal for the third consecutive year, Skymet Weather, a private weather forecasting agency, said on Tuesday. In its preliminary forecast for 2021, Skymet said the rainfall from June to September is likely to 103% of the long period average (LPA) of 88cm based on average monsoon rain from 1961 to 2010. In 2020 and 2019, the monsoon was above normal at 110% and 109% of LPA respectively.The Monsoon season, which begins on June 1, is crucial for summer crops and brings about 70% of India’s annual rainfall. It is crucial to the country’s agriculture, which is one of the mainstays of its economy. Monsoon spurs farm produce and improves rural spending. Monsoon rains are a lifeline for about 60% of the country’s net cultivated area, which has no irrigation. The monsoon impacts inflation, jobs, and industrial demand. Good farm output keeps a lid on food inflation. Ample harvests raise rural incomes and helps inject demand into the economy.In its forecast, Skymet said the northern plains, along with few parts of the northeast region, are likely to be at risk of being rain deficient through the season. Also, interior parts of Karnataka could face scanty rains in the core monsoon months of July and August.“The onset month of June and the withdrawal phase of September is assuring good countrywide rainfall distribution,” Skymet said in its statement.Yogesh Patil, CEO, Skymet, said La Nina conditions have been prevailing in the Pacific Ocean since last year. “It is, however, expected to remain neutral through the monsoon season. Occurrence of El Nino, which normally corrupts the monsoon, is ruled out.”The Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) is neutral and oscillating lightly on either side of the Zero Line. It is unlikely to harm the monsoon season. IOD is characterised by warmer sea surface temperature in the equatorial Indian Ocean. Positive IOD conditions are usually associated with normal or above normal monsoon.Also Read | Pre-monsoon rain deficiency hits statesEl Niño and the Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is a periodic fluctuation in sea surface temperature and the air pressure of the overlying atmosphere across the equatorial Pacific Ocean, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.It has a major influence on weather and climate patterns such as heavy rains, floods, and drought. El Niño has a warming influence on global temperatures, while La Niña has the opposite effect. In India, El Nino is associated with drought or weak monsoon while La Nina with strong monsoon and above-average rains, and colder winters.DS Pai, senior scientist, India Meteorological Department (IMD), Pune, said in January that in a few years, India may be entering an epoch of above-average monsoon rains. The 1945 to 1985 period was also an above-average rain epoch. But from 1985 onwards, it has been a below-average rain epoch.“In a few years, we are likely to transition to an epoch of above-average monsoon rains because monsoon follows epochs of around 31 years in these transitions. An above-average epoch will be good for the country and agriculture but would mean more extreme rainfall events for which we should prepare,” M Mohapatra, director-general, IMD, said in January during a brainstorming session on monsoon forecast.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/monsoon-likely-to-be-normal-at-103-of-long-period-average-skymet-weather-101618302520967.html
13-04-2021||India||India fast-tracks emergency approvals for foreign-produced Covid-19 vaccines||The central government on Tuesday fast-tracked approvals for foreign-produced Covid-19 vaccines that have been granted emergency use authorisation in other countries. This has been done to expedite the pace and coverage of the ongoing vaccination drive in the country.Calling vaccination as one of the critical pillars of Covid-19 control and management, the government said that fast-tracking of approvals will facilitate easier access to foreign Covid-19 vaccines approved by credible foreign regulators.The decision will pave the way for imports, fill and finish as well as production in India of those vaccines which have already been received such authorisation in other countries, the Centre said.A meeting of National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for Covid-19 (NEGVAC) was held on April 11, where the issue was discussed.

The statement said the contraband was seized in 34 searches conducted by the NCB’s Delhi zone team.NCB’s deputy director (operations) KPS Malhotra said the traffickers used the darknet to receive orders from international clients and communicated with suppliers and carriers of the consignments using various encrypted platforms including WhatsApp.“They used encrypted platforms to ensure the anonymity of both the receivers of consignments and the people involved in the logistics. The destinations of the consignments were primarily the US, the UK and Europe. To evade the law and escape detection, the syndicate used to conceal the psychotropic drugs in herbal supplement packages,” Malhotra said in a NCB statement.NCB officials said last month, more than two parcels of “herbal supplements”, destined for an address in the UK, were seized from a courier company in west Delhi’s Kirti Nagar following a tipoff that the parcels contained psychotropic drugs.The packets were opened and more than two kilos of opioid pills (Tramadol) -- the use of opioid pills is strictly curtailed across the world -- were recovered.“We traced the supply chain and found that multiple channels were used to deliver the parcels to the courier company. Our efforts led us to a drug peddler, Kapil Aggarwal in Agra, UP, from whose godown at least a dozen similar parcels, all destined for the same UK address, were seized. We arrested Aggarwal and his interrogation led us to a man named A Goyal, also from Agra, and the recovery of more such pills,” said an NCB officer, who asked not to be named.During his interrogation, Goyal disclosed the name of a key player of the syndicate whose job was to receive orders on the darknet and further issue instructions on WhatsApp and other encrypted platforms for procurement, packaging and dispatch of the contraband, the deputy director said. NCB did not reveal the name of the key player, citing ongoing investigations.“Goyal also revealed that the opioid pills were being supplied to them by a pharmaceutical company in Haridwar, Uttarakhand. The NCB searched the factory, found discrepancies in the documentation and seized more tramadol pills, cough syrup and other psychotropic drugs. The owner of the company is currently on the run,” Malhotra said.According to Malhotra, the NCB’s investigation revealed that the syndicate is a complex one and connected to various other groups involved in the illegal trade using a similar modus operandi. Last year, in a similar operation, the police had arrested a man named Mausam alias Kashmir and the name of one Som Dutt from Delhi had emerged during Mausam’s interrogation.“As Dutt’s name also surfaced during the interrogation of Aggarwal and Goyal, our team collected information about him from Delhi’s Narela. Dutt is one of the prominent shippers of the cartel and he uses India Post for sending consignments to the US and UK, using forged IDs. Dutt’s interrogation led to the arrest of Manish from Balia in Uttar Pradesh,” added the NCB deputy director.He said the arrest of the factory owner and the key player will help the NCB to further unravel the cartel and its dealings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ncb-busts-drug-cartel-that-received-supplies-from-uttarakhand-pharma-factory-101618298681087.html

The number of fatalities due to the virus also increased, with 879 deaths registered in the last 24 hours, forcing many states to impose curbs. While Madhya Pradesh imposed a week-long lockdown in its capital city of Bhopal, Haryana clamped a night curfew with immediate effect. Maharashtra, the state worst-hit by the pandemic, readied its plan for a lockdown-- it is expected to make an announcement on Wednesday -- even as it decided to postpone state board exams for classes 10 and 12. Prime Minister Narendra Modi will hold a meeting with governors and lieutenant governors on tackling the pandemic tomorrow.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indias-covid-vaccine-tally-crosses-108-million-mark-101618290220469.html
13-04-2021||India||Election to 3 RS seats in Kerala to be held on April 30: Election Commission||The Election Commission (EC) on Monday declared that polls to the three Rajya Sabha seats from Kerala falling vacant later this month will be held on April 30.The poll panel issued a detailed press note for "conduct of biennial election to the council of states from Kerala to fill the seats of members retiring on April 21".Those retiring from these seats include Abdul Wahab (IUML), K K Ragesh (CPI M) and Vayalar Ravi (Congress).The EC said notification for the polls will be issued on Tuesday and polling will be held between 9 am and 4 pm on April 30. The votes will be counted on the same day.In Rajya Sabha polls, votes are counted in the evening.The election process for these seats were in the news recently after the EC had earlier put in abeyance these polls.The decision of the poll panel to issue a fresh schedule came on a day when the Kerala High Court directed the it to hold the biennial election to the three Rajya Sabha seats from the state from the present state assembly."It is seen that at least after it arrived at the decision that it's the duty to see that the vacancies are filled up at the earliest, the commission is yet to take any steps for the same," the court said."When the Commission itself has admitted that it is duty-bound to conduct the election and complete the process at the earliest, it is only appropriate that it takes expeditious steps without further delay to complete the election before another electorate comes into existence on May 02, 2021," Justice P V Asha said in the order.Days after the EC put the Rajya Sabha polls in the state in abeyance, Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan had questioned the "political intervention" behind the commission's decision.The EC had then responded by saying that the Law Ministry has "no remit" to make recommendation on the schedule of Rajya Sabha elections.Monday's press note said the EC had then "received a reference" from the Law Ministry "wherein a question of constitutional propriety was raised." Initially, election to the three Rajya Sabha seats was to be held on April 12.Members of legislative assembly elect Rajya Sabha members. The MLAs of the outgoing assembly, in which the ruling LDF has a majority, were to elect the three new members. Polling for Kerala assembly elections were held on April 6 and counting will take place on May 2.Rajya Sabha elections are usually held before the expiry of the term of retiring members.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/election-to-3-rs-seats-in-kerala-to-be-held-on-april-30-election-commission-101618288780293.html

13-04-2021||India||Amid rising cases, demand for Covid-19 care coaches returns||Months after being kept on standby, the Indian Railways’ Covid-19 isolation coaches are back in demand amid rising cases. The railways’ western zone has received a demand from Nandurbar, a Maharashtra district close to Gujarat border, for around 95 coaches and 1,500 beds.“Each Covid-19 care rake will have 20 coaches, comprising modified Sleeper and General coaches; each coach can accommodate 16 patients.The coaches will be suitably positioned as mutually agreed upon between the district administration of Nandurbar and divisional administration of Mumbai division of Western Railways,” a memorandum of understanding signed between Western Railways and the district authorities on April 11 noted.The district is currently under lockdown till April 15 and has reported close to 400 cases daily since March. Maharashtra on Monday reported 51,751 new Covid-19 cases, its lowest one-day count since April 5, taking the tally to 3,458,996. The state also reported 258 fatalities on Monday, taking toll to 58,245. Of the 258 deaths, 169 occurred in the previous 48 hours, 59 in the past week and the remaining are from the period before that.The Covid-19 isolation coaches were designed to be used for patients with mild symptoms in areas where states have “exhausted the facilities” and need to augment capacities for isolation of both suspected and confirmed cases, according to the railways.Also Read | Why is Covid-19 spreading rapidly in India? Experts identify 4 reasonsThe railways will be responsible for the basic infrastructure and maintenance of the premises like cleaning and sanitisation of platforms, provision of housekeeping materials like linen and blankets, management of bio-toilets, power and electric supply arrangements, watering, communication facilities and signage and marking of different areas. It will also provide catering and oxygen cylinders in the coaches, it said in its guidelines for the coaches last year.The Centre built its first prototype of a Covid coach in April last year; by May it was ready to deploy 5,231 railway coaches across 215 stations in 15 states considering the possibility of an increase in cases of Covid-19.But with little demand from the states for these coaches, on May 21, 2020 the Railway Board wrote to its zones to reconvert 60% of the Covid-19 coaches into normal ones to be utilised on Shramik Special trains launched to ferry stranded migrant workers back to their homes in the Indian hinterland.

13-04-2021||India||Why is Covid-19 spreading rapidly in India? Experts identify 4 reasons||As the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) infects more and more people across the country, many people want to know why are daily cases flaring up so sharply in India? Scientists have given four reasons for it.One of the reasons for the spread of the infection is the emerging mutants - both imported and homegrown. “A new double mutant has emerged in India and is reported in 15-20 per cent of cases analysed from Maharashtra. If this percentage goes up further, it would be a clear indication of its role in the Maharashtra surge,” virologists Shahid Jameel told news agency PTI.In India, variants first identified in the UK, South Africa and Brazil have been found.Also Watch | ‘Covid-19 pandemic long way from over’: WHO Chief warnsIn late March, the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) announced that a new variant had been identified in samples of saliva taken from people in Maharashtra, Delhi and Punjab.The genome sequencing carried out by Indian SARS-CoV-2 Consortium on Genomics (INSACOG), a consortium of 10 labs in India, identified two important mutations in the variant dubbed as “double mutant”.Explaining that the UK variant is known to be about 50 per cent more infectious, Jameel said one of the two mutations in the double mutant was also found in California, US, where it was associated with increased transmission.Next comes the lowering of guard by the people of India - something that the government too has highlighted and urged people of the country to keep following Covid-appropriate behaviour.“Everything opening up to pre-Covid levels and behaviour that was no longer risk-averse exposed the susceptible population in a big way," said Jameel."The speed of spread in the second wave is twice as fast as in the first wave. Partly due to variants and partly lowering of the guard,” explained another virologist T Jacob John, a professor at Tamil Nadu’s Christian Medical College (CMC).Talking about the vaccination drive, Jameel said the government needs to speed it up. “For various reasons, those eligible, including healthcare and frontline workers, were hesitant to get vaccines. Those above 60 also did not show enough eagerness even though cases had started going up by early March. Now we are on a very fast rising curve with only 0.7 per cent Indians having received both doses and only about 5 per cent having received one dose. That is too low to make an impact,” said Jameel.Apart from this, a recent study by the Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (IGIB) said that 20% to 30% of those infected with Covid-19 lose immunity after six months. This has also been pointed out by health experts as one of the reasons why people who have already recovered from Covid-19, catch the infection again, leading to a spike in the number of cases.According to scientists, including those from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT)-Kanpur, the ongoing second-wave could peak by mid-April, following which the infections may see a steep decline by the end of May.India recorded 161,736 fresh Covid-19 cases in the last 24 hours, the Union health ministry data showed on Tuesday. With this, the infection tally has crosses 13.68 million mark. The country also recorded 879 related fatalities in the said period, which pushed the death toll to 171,058.The situation in Maharashtra and Delhi is particularly bad - the national capital recorded 11,491 fresh cases of the infection on Monday, its highest-ever single-day tally. Four other states also reported their respective single-day spike on Monday.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/why-is-covid-19-spreading-rapidly-in-india-experts-identify-4-reasons-101618285916036.html

The Britishers had banned gatherings at the time and to punish civilians for their 'disobedience', Brigadier-General Reginald Dyer ordered the army to fire into a crowd of thousands of unarmed Indians who had come together to celebrate the festival of Baisakhi, unaware of the order.The colonial troops entered Jallianwala Bagh in Punjab's Amritsar and blocked the main entrance behind them to ensure nobody could flee before opening fire on the crowd for about 10 minutes. Many jumped into a well in a desperate attempt to save themselves as the soldiers showered bullets at them.Also Read: Jallianwala Bagh massacre ‘a shameful act’, says UK envoy in AmritsarWhile the official figure released by the British claimed that a little over 350 people were killed in the massacre, the Congress party claimed that the number was as high as 1,000.The only punishment that Dyer, who was lauded for his actions by some in Britain but criticised by the others, had to face was being removed from his post and denied promotion. He was also barred from being deployed in India further.Amid growing demand for an apology for the massacre, former British Prime Minister Theresa May expressed “regret” over the incident. She called the incident a "shameful scar" on British Indian history but stopped short of tendering an apology.In 2019, more than 100 years after the massacre, British High Commissioner to India Dominic Asquith visited the Jallianwala Bagh National Memorial and paid tribute to those killed.“The events of Jallianwala Bagh 100 years ago today reflect a shameful act in British-Indian history. We deeply regret what happened and the suffering caused. I am pleased today that the UK and India have and remain committed to developing further a thriving 21st century partnership,” Asquith noted in the visitors’ book at the memorial.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jallianwala-bagh-massacre-here-is-how-the-deadly-incident-transpired-102-years-ago-101618276752335.html

13-04-2021||India||Political slugfest erupts after Gujarat BJP chief offers free remdesivir||Amid a massive nationwide spike in Covid-19 cases, reports of severe shortage of remdesivir, a key antiviral drug, have triggered a political tug-of-war in Gujarat with the Congress demanding the arrest of state Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) chief CR Patil, who offered free injections of the drug.On Friday, Patil organised some 5,000 vials of remdesivir and offered to distribute them free to people from the BJP office in Surat, while the state reeled under a severe shortage.A controversy erupted over this with chief minister Vijay Rupani and his deputy Nitin Patel stating they were not aware how Patil managed the injections and that it was not part of the state’s procurement. The BJP defended Patil and said his aim was to help the people of Surat, suffering from shortage of the antiviral drug. The Congress, meanwhile, accused the government of indulging in politics over shortage of the drug.On Monday, a Congress delegation, led by state unit chief Amit Chavda, called on Gujarat governor Acharya Devvrat and sought strict action against Patil for “flouting rules”. “No one knows how Patil procured 5,000 remdesivir injections. Is he having any licence to buy and store such critical drug in his premises? “How much money was spent (to buy the drug) and under which law it was procured? There is absolutely no information available about it,” Chavda told reporters.Remdesivir continues to be used in India despite WHO recommending against its use, on the grounds that there is no evidence that it works. India has banned the export of remdesivir and its ingredients in an attempt to address the shortage — brought about, in part, by hoarding and indiscriminate use.“It appears that one man is controlling the entire state. Since the BJP government is not taking any action, we urged the Governor to intervene in the matter. “We want the police to lodge an FIR and arrest Paatil for this illegal act so that others refrain from doing such acts in the future,” said Chavda.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/political-slugfest-erupts-after-gujarat-bjp-chief-offers-free-remdesivir-101618257519928.html
13-04-2021||India||Covid-19 lockdown in Bhopal, Haryana night curbs begin||More regions were forced to reintroduce curbs on social movement due to a sharp rise in coronavirus disease cases, as India recorded a daily surge in infections with 160,676 new cases on Monday.While a complete week-long lockdown was announced in Madhya Pradesh capital Bhopal, the Haryana government decided to impose night curfew across the state.These are the latest in a string of regions across the country that have again started enforcing curbs ranging from night curfews to limits on public assembly as they struggle to reel from the second wave of Covid-19.On Monday, Bhopal district collector said Avinash Lavaniya said a lockdown has been imposed from 9pm on Monday till 6am on April 19. “The emergency services including medical and health, transportation of goods, movement of students for examination, construction work, vegetable and fruit vendors will be allowed during the curfew,” Lavaniya said.The state recorded 6,489 new cases on Monday, taking the state’s tally to 344,634, according to HT’s dashboard. Till Sunday, there were 5,234 active Covid-19 cases in Bhopal. “Despite all efforts, the Covid 19 cases are not coming down. To contain the spread, Corona curfew has become important,” the Bhopal collector said. State medical education minister Vishwas Sarang said that anyone found violating the lockdown norms would be booked under Section 144 of the CrPC.In Haryana, the state government clamped a night curfew with immediate effect on a day that the state recorded 3,818 new cases. The state has recorded more than 21,000 infections in the last nine weeks. “Night curfew between 9 pm and 5 am will be imposed from tonight and will remain in force till further orders,” state home and health minister Anil Vij told PTI.Additional Chief Secretary, Revenue and Disaster Management, Sanjeev Kaushal, in an order, said that it is imperative to put in place strict measures for social distancing to contain the spread of the virus.“A lot of non-essential movement of people and vehicles has been reported during night hours,’’ the order said. “No person shall leave their home or move on foot or by vehicle or travel or stand or roam around on any road or public places during the above said hours.”Emergency services like hospitals, pharmacies and ATMs will be allowed to function round the clock, the order said. The order further states that there are no curbs on interstate and intrastate movement of essential and non-essential goods. “All vehicle and persons in bona fide transit shall be allowed to pass, but only after verification of point of origin and destination,” the order said.Meanwhile, Karnataka chief minister BS Yediyurappa said his government would impose a lockdown, if the necessity arises. The state recorded 9,579 new cases on Monday, taking its total tally to 1,074,869.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-lockdown-in-bhopal-haryana-night-curbs-begin-101618257674812.html
13-04-2021||India||Clear more vaccines fast, says Sonia Gandhi to PM Modi||Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Monday wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, asking for emergency approval of all vaccine candidates with required clearances, vaccination for anyone who demands it and minimum monthly guaranteed income of ₹6,000 in every eligible citizen’s account to help them cope with Covid-19-induced lockdowns in various places.The Congress president also suggested that all equipment, medicine and support infrastructure for Covid-19 should be exempted from the Goods and Services Tax (GST). In the letter dated April 12, Gandhi informed the PM about a meeting she held with all Congress- and ally-ruled states, and said: “While it will be necessary on one hand to substantially ramp up our domestic production capacity, it will also be prudent to allow emergency use authorization of all the vaccine candidates that have the required clearances, without any further delay.”Gandhi’s letter was released minutes after Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine got emergency use authorisation by a subject expert committee of India’s drug controller. Experts say the entry of Sputnik V will beef up the availability of Covid-19 vaccines in the states that, till Sunday, depended on Covaxin and Covishield.Gandhi maintained that most of the states, including those ruled by the Bharatiya Janata Party and its allies, are left with stocks of just 3-5 days. Asking for vaccines for all, she wrote: “Vaccines are our foremost hope. Accordingly, with enhanced availability, categories eligible for vaccination should be expanded on the basis of need and exposure rather than just age. In the same vein, the numbers allocated to a state has to be based on the prevalence and projection of infection....”On Monday, Rahul Gandhi took to Twitter and urged people to speak up for the vaccines-for-all and urged the PM to stop “eventbaazi” and open up the immunisation drive.In a minute-long video, Rahul attacked the PM and echoed the concerns of other Congress leaders over an uncertain atmosphere in the country regarding the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/clear-more-vaccines-fast-says-sonia-gandhi-to-pm-modi-101618257732041.html

Vice President Venkaiah Naidu will also attend the meeting.The scheduled meeting underlines the urgency of the situation as Covid-19 cases in April have surpassed the last year’s peak of the first wave, demanding frantic efforts from different quarters to stem the surging pandemic.Read more: Maharashtra, Punjab, C'garh: Govt points out gaps in Covid containment strategyThe meeting has been scheduled in the wake of the PM’s last meeting with all chief ministers on April 8 in which Modi spoke about involving the governors in the Covid management in states. Modi had maintained that governors should also be involved as the CMs already have their hands full.The PM had suggested that the governors, along with the chief ministers, can reach out to social influencers such as religious heads, writers and civil society to spread the message of Covid-19 awareness as people have started taking the pandemic very lightly.Read more: Experts clear Russia’s Sputnik Covid-19 vaccine for use in IndiaThe meeting, which will start at 6pm on Wednesday, is likely to see the PM reiterating the areas of help from the governor.

13-04-2021||India||Norms go for a toss as millions throng 'shahi snan' amid Covid-19 surge||On the first official date of the shahi snan (holy bath) in the ongoing Mahakumbh at Haridwar, 3.12 million devotees gathered to take a dip in the Ganges, with next to no social distancing, poor adherence to mask discipline, and patchy enforcement of guidelines such as every bather needing to be registered — all of which were flagged by experts as a significant cause for concern amid a second wave of the coronavirus disease that is surging through the country.The administrators in charge of the event did not enforce social distancing guidelines citing the huge numbers. “It is difficult to ensure social distancing during shahi snan when lakhs of seers and pilgrims are at one specific Ganga ghat. Strict measures may lead to a stampede like situation,” said Sanjay Gunjiyal, inspector general, Mela force.He added that “we are ensuring pilgrims wear masks, sanitise and safely take holy Ganga dip and return to their base,” but many people heading for the ghat were not sporting masks.According to officials, only 33,000 tests, including antigen, were carried out at the Mahakumbh, although Gunjiyal claimed that the police has ensured that anyone entering the state from April 1 carried a negative RT-PCR test report. The requirement, he added, will last till April 30.Mahant Hari Giri, general secretary of the apex body of seers, Akhil Bharatiya Akhada Parishad said: “They tried to follow the (Covid) protocol but couldn’t due to large numbers. However, many of them have already taken the vaccine and undertaken Covid-19 tests”On Monday, the first official Shahi Snan, or royal holy bath, after the month-long Mahakumbh was notified by the state government on April 1, devotees gathered to take holy dip in the Ganga in huge numbers, with most not wearing masks.Most police and health officials chose not to act against the devotees. On March 20, chief minister Tirath Singh Rawat said that “no devotees will be unnecessarily harassed in the name of Covid-19 restrictions but the government will ensure a strict implementation of all the necessary precautions.”That they would not be able to maintain this balance became evident during the religious procession of seers from the 13 akhadas in the morning; the seers chose not to wear masks and did not practice social distancing.To be sure, health officials were seen stopping devotees (other than the seers) minus face masks and handing over free masks to them.Expressing “grave” concern over such a large congregation of people at one place Dr DD Chowdhury, national vice president of Indian Medical Association (IMA), who has been also treating Covid-19 patients since the outbreak of pandemic last year in Uttarakhand, said, “it is absolutely shocking and unfortunate that such a large number of people were allowed to gather in Haridwar Mahakumbh. It will spell trouble for the country in next few days in this health emergency. “There is another shahi snan on Wednesday, and Dr Chowdhury estimates that by the end of that, Haridwar would have seen 5 million people taking a dip over three days. Only seers and VIPs should have been allowed, he added. He said he feared that the devotees may become “ responsible for spreading the virus in various parts of the country when they return to their home.”IG Gunjiyal said the police did try to check the Covid negative reports of the devotees but that this was impossible to do. “People without registration were allowed to enter after getting their Covid tests done,” he said, admitting that nobody was turned away .Meanwhile, social activist Anoop Nautiyal said: “Not only the social distancing is not being maintained in the mega event, the health department has also failed to meet the Covid-19 testing target of 50,000 as directed by the Nainital High Court.”Nautiyal said, “At present the average number of tests each day in the mela area since April 1 is 17,529 which is not even half the target of 50,000. On Sunday, the number was 19966 and on Saturday it was 20451.”“On paper the government will show that they implemented all the norms the ground reality is absolutely opposite to that,” he said.But district chief medical officer SK Jha countered these claims: “We are taking test samples of devotees each day which includes both Rapid Antigen and RT-PCR test. On Sunday, we took 58,000 test samples and during Monday’s shahi snan, we took 30,000 samples till 1pm.”The impact of the Mahakumbh, which threatens to become a super spreader event will be felt most in Himachal Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Delhi, from where most of the devotees come, said Dr Chowdhury. All of these “should issue a red alert in their states , keep data of all their residents coming back from these shahi snans and put them in quarantine for seven days as soon as they return.”“The states should also conduct Rapid Antigen test, if not RT-PCR test of all these people to check the spread “.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/norms-go-for-a-toss-as-millions-throng-shahi-snan-amid-surge-101618257830397.html
13-04-2021||India||Sputnik V gets India nod||An expert panel of India’s drugs regulator on Monday recommended emergency use approval of Russia’s Sputnik V coronavirus vaccine, according to officials, paving the way for the country to have access to a third vaccine at a time when several regions are reporting shortages and as infections continue to surge.The recommendation, issued by the subject expert committee (SEC), now awaits a formal approval by the drugs controller general of India (DCGI), who heads the Central Drugs Standards Control Organisation (CDSCO). SEC analysed data from Sputnik V’s full clinical trials in Russia as well as a smaller bridging study in India.“The final decision on the approval will be of the drugs controller general of India. Normally, the drugs controller adheres to the SEC recommendations. The vaccines for initial use might be imported but it is for the companies to decide eventually. It always helps to have multiple options to choose from when you are trying to control a pandemic,” said a senior government official, asking not to be named.The vaccine’s efficacy is pegged at 91.6% based on the final assessment of clinical trials in Russia, where roughly 20,000 people were part of the Phase 3 study. In India, the vaccine is being tested in 1,600 people in a phase 2/3 trial meant as a “bridging study” that all foreign-made pharmaceutical products need to undergo.Read more: Covid-19 a reminder human, animal health interconnected: Harsh VardhanThe bridging study in India is being carried out by Dr Reddy’s Laboratories, which also has a contract to distribute 100 million doses once the final approvals are in place.The Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), which is marketing the vaccine globally, is expected to supply the first doses to Dr Reddy’s shortly after the approval.According to a pharma industry representative asking not to be named, India is yet to formalise any procurement order with Dr Reddy’s. “Dr Reddy’s is in talks with the government regarding procurement for a few months but nothing has been formalised yet. The modalities of distribution will be worked out only after they see the contours of approval granted to them,” said this person.Read more: Maharashtra, Punjab, C'garh: Govt points out gaps in Covid containment strategyA spokesperson for Dr Reddy’s said the company is yet to receive confirmation of emergency use authorisation (EUA) from the government. “Dr. Reddy’s and RDIF are working diligently with the Indian regulatory authorities to obtain the approval for Sputnik V.

Hiran went missing on March 4 and his body washed up ashore the Reti Bunder creek on March 5.The National Investigation Agency (NIA) arrested suspended Mumbai policeman Sachin Vaze in connection with the explosives case on March 13. Last month, the federal agency also took over the probe into the murder case, in which the ATS had arrested two people. The NIA now has custody of all three men.Read more: After crime branch, Mumbai Police's EOW officials to face 'clean up'After scanning the WhatsApp calls on March 4, ATS zeroed in on a particular number which matched the location of Hiran’s house and the approximate time he had left his home on of March 4. The ATS official said that the team reached out to mobile service providers to procure the numbers which were in use at the time. From this, they uncovered the number which was used to call Hiran on his phone.Hiran’s wife, Vimla, had said in her statement that Hiran had received a call from an officer named Tawde following which he left home at 8.30pm. Hiran did not return that night, and when Vimla tried his phone at 11 pm, she said it was switched off.Hiran’s body was found the following morning, but his personal effects including his phone and wallet are still untraceable.The officials were able to find the address that the number was registered on, which led them to a trader in Bhuj, Gujarat. The investigators discovered that the SIM card corresponding to the number was procured by a local trader. When questioned by the Thane ATS unit, he told the police that he sold 14 SIM cards to a cricket bookie, Naresh Gor.The trader also told the police that Gor had given one of the 14 SIM cards to one of his friends who worked as a bar dancer.The ATS team traced the woman who led them to a hotel in Mumbai which Gor frequently stayed at. In order to book a room, Gor would supply his address and identity card details, she told the investigating team. The officers were then able to find Gor through the Aadhar card details that he had supplied to that hotel.Gor was arrested from Bhuj on March 21. The bookie reportedly revealed the name of a south Mumbai-based club owner through whom he met former police constable Vinayak Shinde and Vaze. Gor reportedly told the ATS that he had given Shinde and Vaze five of the 14 SIM cards that he bought from the Bhuj trader.It was one of these SIM cards that were used to contact Hiran on the evening of March 4. The ATS suspect that Shinde or Vaze pretended to be a policeman by the name of Tawde to lure Hiran to a spot along Ghodbunder Road in Thane, following which he was abducted. The call reportedly lasted for 11 minutes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/11min-call-led-ats-to-accused-in-hiran-case-101618252079925.html

But there are officers in EOW who have been in the department since the past six-seven years,” said a source from EOW.A senior officer indicated that Monday’s transfer can just be the beginning and a huge chunk of officers who are in EOW since long could be shunted out in the upcoming general transfers, slated to be announced in June.Recently, joint commissioner of police (EOW) Niket Kaushik had issued an order to all EOW unit heads, directing them to not assign officers, who have served in the unit for over four years, any new cases.EOW investigates multi-crore financial institution scams, corporate and investment frauds, housing frauds by builders and other white-collar crimes. Cases involving more than ₹6-crore disputes or complex financial crimes are assigned to EOW.On the backdrop of controversies surrounding suspended assistant police inspector Sachin Vaze and former police commissioner Param Bir Singh, Nagrale after taking charge on March 17 first started taking on cops who might have had developed close proximity with “unwarranted elements” by enjoying long tenure in the same department. Within six days of joining, he had shunted out 84 officers, including 65 from the crime branch.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mumbai-top-cop-transfers-13-eow-officers-101618251926349.html

13-04-2021||India||SC to hear PIL for action against PM, middleman in Rafale jet deal||The Supreme Court will hear after two weeks a public interest litigation (PIL) that seeks the prosecution of alleged middleman Sushen Gupta and Prime Minister Narendra Modi under charges of cheating, breach of trust, and criminal conspiracy, over alleged kickbacks of 1 million Euros in the Rafale fighter jet deal.Advocate-petitioner ML Sharma mentioned his PIL before Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde, who said the matter will be listed after two weeks. No date, however, was set for the hearing.Sharma claimed he was making the rounds of the registry of the top court to get this matter listed urgently, but to little avail. The lawyer also requested the CJI to hear the petition himself, but justice Bobde, who retires on April 23, did not comment on it.Read more: Several staff members of Supreme Court test positive for Covid-19In December 2018, the top court rejected a bunch of petitions, including one by former Union ministers Yashwant Sinha and Arun Shourie, along with activist-lawyer Prashant Bhushan, for a court-monitored probe into the fighter jet deal between India and France. It noted at the time that there was no evidence on irregularity or corruption in the government-to-government deal for 36 fighter jets, and that the decision-making process could not be doubted.Later, in November 2019, the apex court dismissed a batch of petitions that sought a review of the 2018 judgment on the ground that certain documents relating to the deal were concealed from the court by the government during the previous round. The court held there was no need for a “roving inquiry” into the case.However, Sharma has now relied on reports by Mediapart, a French online journal, published earlier this month. Medipart claimed that it was in possession of documents that showed Dassault Aviation, which manufactures the Rafale jet, and its industrial partner Thales, a defence electronics firm, paid “middleman” Sushen Gupta around 1 million euros (approximately ₹8.9 crore by the current exchange rate) “secret commissions” in connection with the ₹59,000 crore deal. Gupta’s name also figures in the Agusta Westland charge sheet.The Rafale deal became controversial, with the Opposition, led by the Congress, claiming that the price at which India bought the Rafale aircraft was ₹1,670 crore each, three times the initial bid of ₹526 crore by the company when the UPA was trying to buy the aircraft. It claimed the previous deal included a technology transfer agreement with HAL. The BJP dismissed the allegations, and called the reports “baseless”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-to-hear-pil-for-action-against-pm-middleman-in-rafale-jet-deal-101618252212950.html
13-04-2021||India||Can’t deny citizenship for failure to explain link with a relative: HC||Not explaining links to some relatives shouldn’t adversely affect individuals’ claim to citizenship or be grounds to declare them foreigners, the Gauhati high court ruled, overturning a controversial 2019 foreigners tribunal order in Assam.According to the 1985 Assam Accord, anyone staying in the state prior to March 24, 1971 or with verifiable lineage to people residing in the state on or before that is an Indian citizen—a requirement also accepted for inclusion in the National Register of Citizens (NRC) .In August 2019, nearly 1.9 million people were excluded from NRC for failing to prove their or ancestors’ residency in Assam before the cutoff date. Those declared foreigners by foreigners’ tribunals (as well their relatives) were also left out. Foreigners tribunals are quasi-judicial courts set up to hear citizenship claims of people flagged by state and election officials as possible outsiders.Read more: Several staff members of Supreme Court test positive for Covid-19The court junked a tribunal order that declared an Assam resident a foreigner because he didn’t explain his lineage thoroughly enough and did not elaborate his relationship with some relatives of his mentioned in the same voters list of 1970 that mentioned his grandparents.“Non explanation of the relationship of the petitioner with other persons mentioned in the voters list of 1970 cannot be a ground for disbelieving the correctness of the entry of the names of the grandparents in the voters list, when the correctness of the entry of the names of the petitioner’s father and grandfather was not questioned,” the court said in its order passed on March 30 but made public on Monday.In 2019, a foreigners’ tribunal in Barpeta district termed Haider Ali an illegal immigrant and declared him a foreigner.Ali, 33, submitted documents showing names of his grandparents in voters’ lists of 1965 and 1970, copies of voters list of 1989 showing his parents names as well as certified copies of subsequent voters’ lists showing his name along with those of his parents. The tribunal didn’t rebut the admissibility of these documents and also didn’t reject them, but based on evidence on record, it held that Ali was not able to prove himself an Indian under section 9 of the Foreigners Act, and declared him a foreigner. The tribunal said that Ali did not mention his relationship to five other persons, whose names appeared along with grandparents in the copies of voters list of 1970 submitted by him, and that, as a result, he was a foreigner.Ali challenged the order in Gauhati HC in 2019. In an order issued on March 30, a division bench of justice N Kotishwar Singh and Justice Manish Chowdhury held the tribunal’s order as wrong. “Non-explanation of the linkage of the petitioner with others...does not affect the credibility or genuineness of the evidence,” it ruled.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cant-deny-citizenship-for-failure-to-explain-link-with-a-relative-hc-101618253171491.html
13-04-2021||India||PM to hold meet with governors over Covid spike across states||New Delhi: Prime Minister Narendra Modi, for the first time, will conduct a meeting on April 14 with the governors and lieutenant governors to tackle the spiralling Covid-19 cases in the country. Vice President Venkaiah Naidu will also attend the meeting. The scheduled meeting underlines the urgency of the situation as Covid cases in April have surpassed last year’s peak of the first wave, demanding frantic efforts from different quarters to stem the surging pandemic. The meeting has been scheduled in the wake of the PM’s last meeting with all chief ministers on April 8 in which Modi spoke about involving the governors in the Covid management in states. Modi had maintained that governors should also be involved as the CMs already have their hands full. The PM had suggested that the governors, along with the chief ministers, can reach out to social influencers such as religious heads, writers and civil society to spread the message of Covid-19 awareness as people have started taking the pandemic very lightly. The meeting, which would start at 6 pm on Wednesday, is likely to see the PM reiterating the areas of help from the governor. An official, however, pointed out that the governors would certainly not be asked to go into the respective governments’ daily handling of the pandemic but make way for a joint collaboration between the elected CMs and the representatives of the President of India. This would also be the first such official meeting between the PM and the Vice President on Covid management. An official pointed out that under the constitutional scheme of things, the PM can’t directly call a meeting of the governors, and only the President or the VP can do so.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-to-hold-meet-with-governors-over-covid-spike-across-states-101618253437910.html
13-04-2021||India||Covid reality contrary to Gujarat govt claims: HC||Ahmedabad: The Gujarat High Court on Monday observed that the people of the state were at “God’s mercy” while hearing a suo-motu petition on increasing Covid cases in the state and directed the government to take several corrective steps.Taking cognizance of media reports on rising number of cases over the last two days -- the state has added at least 10,000 cases in this time -- and the shortage of hospital beds, Remdesivir injections, oxygen, ventilators and vaccines, chief justice Vikram Nath took up a public interest litigation on Sunday while observing: “The State is heading towards a health emergency of sorts.” On Monday, not convinced by the detailed explanations and replies by state Advocate General Kamal Trivedi, a division bench of Nath and Justice Bhargav Karia observed: “People now think that they are at God’s mercy.” The high court bench heard out Trivedi but insisted, “The situation is quite different than what you are claiming. You are saying that everything is alright. But the reality is contrary to that.” The court went on to point out that there was a “trust deficit” among the people. “People are cursing the government and the government is cursing the people. This will not help. We need to break this chain of infection,” the court said.The bench refused to accept most of the Advocate General’s explanations on the steps being taken by the Gujarat government, especially on the availability of beds or Remdesivir, a key anti-viral drug that is in short supply.Queues can be seen outside the Zydus Hospital in Ahmedabad run by Zydus Healthcare that also makes Remdesivir . AG Trivedi denied that there was a shortage of the drug and cited expert medical opinion that it should be sparingly used given that it could have adverse side-effects on the liver and the kidney of the patients.Remdesivir continues to be used in India despite WHO recommending against its use , on the grounds that there is no evidence that it works. India has banned the export of Remdesivir and ingredients that go into it in an attempt to address the shortage -- brought about, in part, by hoarding and indiscriminate use. Trivedi told the court that people who do not need the drug were also trying to buy it as a precautionary measure. He stated, “Remdesivir is not required if the patient is under home treatment or is asymptomatic and not critical.” He added that even the supply was limited and said, “Only seven companies make it. The production is just 1.75 lakh vials per day. We are procuring around 25,000 injections every day for Gujarat.” But the high court wondered whether the government was trying to control the supply of Remdesivir when people were scrambling to get it and even designated hospitals were saying they did not have it. “The medicine is available, but it is being controlled by the government. Why can’t people buy it? Make sure it is available everywhere. There is no shortage of Remdesivir. Everything is available with you. We want results, not reasons.”Gujarat BJP President CR Patil organised some 5,000 vials of Remdivisir and offered to distribute them free to people from the BJP office in Surat, while the state reeled under a severe shortage.A controversy erupted over this with Chief Minister Vijay Rupani and his deputy Nitin Patel stating they were not aware how Patil managed the injections and that it was not part of the State’s procurement. The BJP defended Patil and said his aim was to help the people of Surat, suffering from shortage of the antiviral drug. The Congress accused the government of indulging in politics over shortage of the drug.The court was also angry over reports that RT-PCR test reports were taking long. Earlier, the RT-PCR test results used to come in 8, 10 or 12 hours.It now takes “almost five days to seven today”, the bench said. “That is for the common man. For someone like you or Mr Devnani (an advocate party to the case) or for us, maybe we can speed up, we can jump the line.” On health infrastructure, the court observed, “(It is happening because) you did not have the infrastructure. You did not increase facilities.” The bench scoffed at the government’s claim that there were adequate number of beds for Covid-19 patients. “I have information that patients are turned away even if beds are available at hospitals. If beds are there, then why are we seeing 40 ambulances with patients waiting outside hospitals?” asked Justice Vikram Nath.Trivedi replied that though all hospitals offered similar treatment, people had preferences and this was the reason for a huge rush outside some hospitals.The advocate general said a lockdown was difficult, pointing out that it would increase the miseries of the poor and migrant workers manifold, especially when industry is in dire straits.The high court finally asked the government to submit a detailed report by Wednesday and scheduled the next hearing for April 15.The Gujarat high court has been monitoring Covid preparedness in the state since last year and had issued series of directions to the state government in the past one year on ramping medical facilities to deal with Covid cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-reality-contrary-to-gujarat-govt-claims-hc-101618253379347.html
13-04-2021||India||Clear more vaccines fast, says Sonia to PM||New Delhi: Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Monday wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, asking for emergency approval of all vaccine candidates with required clearances, vaccination for anyone who demands it and minimum monthly guaranteed income of ₹6,000 in every eligible citizen’s account to help them cope with Covid-19-induced lockdowns in various places.The Congress president also suggested that all equipment, medicine and support infrastructure for Covid-19 should be exempted from the Goods and Services Tax (GST).In the letter dated April 12, Gandhi informed the PM about a meeting she held with all Congress- and ally-ruled states, and said: “While it will be necessary on one hand to substantially ramp up our domestic production capacity, it will also be prudent to allow emergency use authorization of all the vaccine candidates that have the required clearances, without any further delay.”Gandhi’s letter was released minutes after Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine got emergency use authorisation by a subject expert committee of India’s drug controller. Experts say the entry of Sputnik V will beef up the availability of Covid-19 vaccines in the states that, till Sunday, depended on Covaxin and Covishield, the two vaccines that were previously approved in India.Gandhi maintained that most of the states, including those ruled by the Bharatiya Janata Party and its allies, are left with stocks of just 3-5 days. Asking for vaccines for all, she wrote: “Vaccines are our foremost hope. Accordingly, with enhanced availability, categories eligible for vaccination should be expanded on the basis of need and exposure rather than just age. In the same vein, the numbers allocated to a state has to be based on the prevalence and projection of infection in that particular state.”On Monday morning, Rahul Gandhi took to Twitter and urged people to speak up for the vaccines-for-all and urged the PM to stop “eventbaazi” and open up the immunisation drive. Last week, Rahul Gandhi wrote a letter to the PM, demanding a ban on the export of vaccines, insisting that India’s vaccination drive was going on at a snail’s pace.In a minute-long video, Rahul Gandhi attacked the Prime Minister and echoed the concerns of other Congress leaders over an uncertain atmosphere in the country regarding the pandemic. He also demanded income support to the poor.The Congress president appealed to the PM to “put into place the much needed scheme of minimum monthly guaranteed income in place and transfer an amount of ₹6,000 in every eligible citizen’s account”. The Congress, in its 2019 election manifesto, proposed a similar scheme of direct financial help to the poorest sections.Sonia Gandhi also demanded that all equipment – even ventilators, oxymeters and oxygen cylinders, and life-saving drugs such as remdesivir and dexamethazone — should be complete exempt from GST.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/clear-more-vaccines-fast-says-sonia-to-pm-101618253377794.html
13-04-2021||India||Lockdown in Bhopal, Haryana night curbs begin||Bhopal/Chandigarh More regions were forced to reintroduce curbs on social movement due to a sharp rise in coronavirus disease cases, as India recorded a daily surge in infections with 160,676 new cases on Monday.While a complete week-long lockdown was announced in Madhya Pradesh capital Bhopal, the Haryana government decided to impose night curfew across the state. These are the latest in a string of regions across the country that have again started enforcing curbs ranging from night curfews to limits on public assembly as they struggle to reel from the second wave of Covid-19 cases.On Monday, Bhopal district collector said Avinash Lavaniya said a lockdown has been imposed from 9pm on Monday till 6am on April 19. “The emergency services including medical and health, transportation of goods, movement of students for examination, construction work, vegetable and fruit vendors will be allowed during the curfew,” Lavaniya said.The state recorded 6,489 new cases on Monday, taking the state’s tally to 344,634, according to HT’s dashboard. Till Sunday, there were 5,234 active Covid-19 cases in Bhopal. “Despite all efforts, the Covid 19 cases are not coming down. To contain the spread, Corona curfew has become important,” the Bhopal collector said. Madhya Pradesh medical education minister Vishwas Sarang said that anyone found violating the lockdown norms would be booked under section 144 of the CrPC.In Haryana, the state government clamped a night curfew with immediate on a day that the state recorded 3,818 new cases. The state has recorded more than 21,000 infections in the last nine weeks.“Night curfew between 9 pm and 5 am will be imposed from tonight and will remain in force till further orders,” state home and health minister Anil Vij was quoted as saying by PTI.Additional Chief Secretary, Revenue and Disaster Management, Sanjeev Kaushal in an order said that it is imperative to put in place strict measures for social distancing to contain the spread of the virus.“A lot of non-essential movement of people and vehicles has been reported during night hours,’’ the order said. “No person shall leave their home or move on foot or by vehicle or travel or stand or roam around on any road or public places during the above said hours.”Emergency services like hospitals, pharmacies and ATMs will be allowed to function round the clock and people would be allowed to avail medical services, the order said. Passengers going to or returning from bus stands, airports or railway stations shall also be exempted.The order further states that there are no curbs on inter-state and intrastate movement of essential and non-essential goods. “All vehicle and persons in bonafide transit shall be allowed to pass, but only after verification of point of origin and destination,” the order said.The state government also decided to restrict gathering of maximum 200 people in indoor spaces and 500 in outdoor. All schools and colleges have been closed till end of this month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lockdown-in-bhopal-haryana-night-curbs-begin-101618253317808.html
13-04-2021||India||Norms go for a toss as millions throng shahi snan amid surge||Dehradun/Haridwar: On the first official date of the  shahi snans (holy bath) in the ongoing Mahakumbh at Haridwar, 2.3 million devotees gathered to take a dip in the Ganges, with next to no social distancing, poor adherence to mask discipline, and patchy enforcement of guidelines such as every bather needing to be registered -- all of which were flagged by experts as a significant cause for concern amid a second wave of the Coronavirus disease that is surging through the country. The administrators in charge of the mela did not enforce social distancing guidelines citing the huge numbers. “It is difficult to ensure social distancing during shahi snan when lakhs of seers and pilgrims are at one specific Ganga ghat. Strict measures may lead to a stampede like situation,” said Sanjay Gunjiyal, inspector general, Mela force.He added that “we are ensuring pilgrims wear masks, sanitise and safely take holy Ganga dip and return to their base,” but many people heading for the ghat were not sporting masks. It is also not clear how many of the devotees possessed RT-PCR test reports showing they tested negative for the virus, although Gunjiyal claimed that the police has enforced this and ensured anyone entering the state from April 1 has such a report. The requirement, he added, will last till April 30. Mahant Hari Giri, general secretary of the apex body of seers, Akhil Bharatiya Akhada Parishad said: “They tried to follow the (Covid) protocol but couldn’t due to large numbers. However, many of them have already taken the vaccine and undertaken Covid-19 tests”On Monday, the first official Shahi Snan or royal holy bath after the month long Mahakumbh was notified by the state government on April 1, devotees gathered to take holy dip in the Ganga in huge numbers, with most not wearing masks. Most police and health officials chose not to act against the devotees. On March 20, chief minister Tirath Singh Rawat said that “no devotees will be unnecessarily harassed in the name of Covid-19 restrictions but the government will ensure a strict implementation of all the necessary precautions.”That they would not be able to maintain this balance became evident during the religious procession of seers from the 13 akhadas in the morning; the seers chose not to wear masks and did not practice social distancing. To be sure, health officials were seen stopping devotees (other than the seers) minus face masks and handing over free masks to them. Expressing “grave” concern over such a large congregation of people at one place Dr DD Chowdhury, national vice president of Indian Medical Association (IMA), who has been also treating Covid-19 patients since the outbreak of pandemic last year in Uttarakhand, said,”it is absolutely shocking and unfortunate that such a large number of people were allowed to gather in Haridwar Mahakumbh. It will spell trouble for the country in next few days in this health emergency. “There is another shahi snan on Wednesday, and Dr Chowdhury estimates that by the end of that, Haridwar would have seen 5 million people taking a dip over three days. Only seers and VIPs should have been allowed, he added. He said he feared that the devotees may become “ responsible for spreading the virus in various parts of the country when they return to their home.” IG Gunjiyal said the police did try to check the Covid negative reports of the devotees but that this was impossible to do. “People without registration were allowed to enter after getting their Covid tests done,” he said, admitting that nobody was turned away .Meanwhile, social activist Anoop Nautiyal said: “Not only the social distancing is not being maintained in the mega event, the health department has also failed to meet the Covid-19 testing target of 50,000 as directed by the Nainital High Court.”Nautiyal said, “At present the average number of tests each day in the mela area since April 1 is 17,529 which is not even half the target of 50,000. On Sunday, the number was 19966 and on Saturday it was 20451.”“On paper the government will show that they implemented all the norms the ground reality is absolutely opposite to that,” he said.But district chief medical officer SK Jha countered these claims: “We are taking test samples of devotees each day which includes both Rapid Antigen and RT-PCR test. On Sunday, we took 58,000 test samples and during Monday’s shahi snan, we took 30,000 samples till 1pm.”The impact of the Mahakumbh, which threatens to become a super spreader event will be felt most in Himachal Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Delhi, from where most of the devotees come, said Dr Chowdhury. All of these “should issue a red alert in their states , keep data of all their residents coming back from these shahi snans and put them in quarantine for seven days as soon as they return.”“The states should also conduct Rapid Antigen test, if not RT-PCR test of all these people to check the spread “.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/norms-go-for-a-toss-as-millions-throng-shahi-snan-amid-surge-101618253137840.html

13-04-2021||India||Pre-monsoon rain deficiency hits states||The pre-monsoon season (March, April and May) has so far remained extremely dry in most parts of the country, the Indian Meterological Department (IMD) has said. While northwest India reported a rain deficiency of 43 per cent between March 1 and April 12, Uttarakhand recorded a deficiency of 78 per cent.Likewise, western and eastern Uttar Pradesh registered a deficiency of 93 per cent while Haryana, Chandigarh and Delhi reported a shortage of 68 per cent during the same period, the weather body noted.“It hasn’t rained at all in the plains during this season. There was light rain and thunderstorm activity in the first week of April but it was very light. Even though four western disturbances have affected the Western Himalayan region this month, their impact has been limited to the upper reaches. It has been so dry that the relative humidity in Delhi yesterday was only 31 per cent in the morning when it is supposed to be the highest and only 17 per cent in the evening,” Kuldeep Shrivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre, said.Read more: Heatwave grips states, IMD predicts a warmer summerIMD Pune’s Standard Precipitation Index for March and first week of April suggested that almost the entire northwest India and Indo-Gangetic Plains region remained mildly to moderately dry between April 1 and 7. The country as a whole recorded a rain deficiency of 42 per cent between March 1 and April 12 with 54 per cent rain deficiency over the southern peninsula, 30 per cent over the central region and 39 per cent over northeast and east India.It is this rain deficiency that has led to several forest fires in Uttarakhand and high dust and particulate matter (PM) levels over the northern plains.Approximately, 8,550 forest fires have been recorded in Uttarakhand alone between April 1 and 12, according to data provided by Forest Survey of India’s Fire Alert System.Read more: India saw third warmest March in 121 years: IMDAccording to officials at Forest Survey of India (FSI), a large number of forest fires are due to man-made factors as well as the dry spell. “Forest fires in large numbers and extent in Uttarakhand are mainly a result of manmade fires and high fuel load on the forest floor. Due to dry spells and high temperatures, the fuel load increases. There are fallen dry leaves and twigs which act as fuel whenever there is a small ignition. If the fuel load is high, then obviously the fires will last longer. Lack of soil moisture and heat helps ignite fire quickly,” Sunil Chandra, deputy director (Forest Geoinformatics Division) of FSI, explained.However, a fresh disturbance is likely to affect the Western Himalayan region between April 14 and 17.

Reports are now taking 36 hours to be issued as the company records a weekly jump of 20% in samples collected since mid-February. “In at least 100 cases last week, we have issued reports to travellers who were already at the airport to board flights,” he said.Read more: Maharashtra, Punjab, C'garh: Govt points out gaps in Covid containment strategyBetween April 5 and April 10, Mumbai tested between 47,000 to 52,000 samples daily. “Mumbai’s current RT-PCR testing capacity stands at 45,000,” said a civic official who did not wish to be named. “If the cases don’t increase further, this capacity is enough. During the first wave, the city’s daily testing capacity was 25,000,” the official added.“Our Covid-19 test was done only 48 hours after the request was made,” said Pudhumai Muniyappa, who said that getting a test in Karnataka’s capital Bengaluru was difficult. “It was after much pleading I got an appointment for bringing my elderly father to a sample collection centre.”Karnataka government officials admitted of long queues at testing centers even though the state said it aims to conduct more than 100,000 tests a day.A Thane based commercial photographer, Amit Rane, 26, cancelled his flight to Bhubaneshwar twice last week after none of the laboratories could guarantee him a Covid-19 test report before the flight taking off time. “I was literally in tears. I felt helpless with all that was happening. I lost ₹16,000 on the flights in a week,” said Rane.Read more: 14 private, 6 state govt hospitals dedicated for 100% Covid-19 treatment in DelhiOfficials of another high Covid infection state, Chhattisgarh, said sample collection was taking up to 2 days in hot spot cities even though the state has increased testing to 50,000 from about 10,000 a month ago.In Madhya Pradesh’s Bhopal and Indore, officials said test reports were being made available only after three to five days depending on the severity of infection, while in some districts reports are coming within 48 hours. “There is a wait for up to two days to get the tests done for people having mild symptoms,” said a state health department official. State health minister Prabhuram Chaudhary said, “We are improving the testing facilities in MP. As of now, about 40,000 tests are being done daily. We are closely monitoring the situation.”In southern states of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, results took up to 48 hours after sample collection.Telangana health minister Eatala Rajender said only 10% of the required number of RT-PCR tests were being done and they were trying to increasing the capacity by another five percentage points. “Even in private diagnostic centres, not more than 20,000 to 21,000 RT-PCR tests are being conducted every day,” he said, adding there was no scarcity of Covid beds in the state. Officials in Andhra Pradesh said that the situation was no different there.Jharkhand too is reeling under a backlog of untested samples. Till April 11, Jharkhand had a backlog of 21,411 samples while Odisha had of about 20,000 samples. “In some cases, results are coming in up to 5 days after sample collection,” a Jharkhand government official on condition of anonymity said, adding that over 5,000 samples were sent to ICMR, Bhubaneswar for testing.Dr Bijay Mohapatra, Odisha’s director of health services said there was no delay in sample testing and any backlog. “All RT-PCR tests are being done in ICMR lab as well as government medical colleges,” he said.Read more: Experts clear Russia’s Sputnik Covid-19 vaccine for use in IndiaLow Covid infected states such as Tripura and Assam also reported no delays in getting the tests done and delivery of reports. “We conduct RT-PCR tests on those who are symptomatic and came in contact with such patients several times.

On Sunday, Assam health minister Himanta Biswa Sarma stated that there is no delay in Covid testing in the state.(with inputs from state bureaus)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/test-results-delayed-as-labs-face-rush-amid-covid-surge-101618252358328.html

13-04-2021||India||HC upholds Akhil Gogoi’s NIA court bail order||GUWAHATI: The high court upheld the special National Investigation Agency (NIA) court order that granted bail to activist Akhil Gogoi in October last year and said that “unlawful acts including arson and violence aimed at creating civil disturbance and law and order problems can’t be termed as terrorist act under purview of Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act unless committed with the requisite intention”. In its order, the HC bench comprising Justice Suman Shyam and Justice Mir Alfaz Ali pointed that sub section (1) (a) of Section 15 of UAPA can be attracted only if an alleged act is in the nature of “terrorist act” and involves use of bombs, explosive substances and other lethal weapons. “The dominant intention of the wrong doer must be to commit a ‘terrorist act’ coming within the ambit of Section 15(1) of the Act,” the verdict delivered on April 9 read. The HC held the NIA court was right in granting bail to Gogoi and dismissed the appeal by the investigating agency. “Unlawful act of any other nature, including acts arson and violence aimed at creating civil disturbance and law and order problems, which may be punishable under ordinary law, would not come under the purview of section (1) of the Act unless it is committed with the requisite intention,” it addedGogoi, who now heads Raijor Dal, a new political party, has been under arrest since December 2019 for allegedly inciting violence during the anti-Citizenship Amendment Act protests. The case was initially lodged in Chabua, Dibrugarh district in December 2019 under various sections of IPC. Subsequently, sections 15(1) (a)/16 of UAPA were added to it. Trial in the case is yet to start. The case was later transferred to NIA the same month and a charge sheet was filed in June last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hc-upholds-akhil-gogoi-s-nia-court-bail-order-101618252237770.html

It also deployed its new Rafale fighter jets in the sector as part of India’s overarching plan to strengthen its military posture in the region.The IAF Commanders’ Conference comes at a time India is planning to begin a formal roll-out of its long-awaited theaterisation plan to best utilise its military’s resources amid growing security threats, with the Air Defence Command and the Maritime Theatre Command set to be launched by May. India will also have three other integrated commands to secure its western, northern and eastern fronts — these are likely to be rolled out by December 2022.In addition, a logistics command is in the works to avoid duplication of efforts and resources.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/iaf-brass-to-hold-key-strategic-meet-101618252057820.html

13-04-2021||India||SC paves way for INS Viraat’s dismantling||The Supreme Court on Monday cleared the decks for the dismantling of iconic warship INS Viraat, dismissing a petition on converting the decommissioned vessel into a maritime museum.A bench, headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde, noted that the ship has already been 40% dismantled by a ship-breaking firm that bought it in an auction last year.“It has already been broken to the extent of 40% by the company which has spent a considerable amount of money in purchasing the decommissioner ship. What is there we can do now? You have come very late,” the bench, which also included justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian told Rupali Sharma, the representative of petitioner M/s Envitech Marine Consultants Pvt Ltd.Read more: Several staff members of Supreme Court test positive for Covid-19After the Bombay high court refused to interfere in November 2020, the company in January this year moved the Supreme Court with a plea that it was willing to buy INS Viraat from the ship-breaking company, Shree Ram Group of Industries, so that the historic warship could be converted into a maritime museum. Envitech offered to purchase it for ₹100 crore.Agreeing to consider this plea, the top court in February stopped further dismantling of the ship, and asked the ship-breaking firm, based in Gujarat’s Alang, to consider Envitech’s offer.But senior advocate Rajeev Dhavan, appearing for the ship-breaking firm, informed the bench that at least 40% of dismantling work has been completed for the ship, which was bought last July at a price of ₹38.54 crore in a valid auction.Dhavan also cited an inspection report by the Marine and Technical Surveyors on February 12 that found the vessel to be a “dead structure” not capable of being in seaworthy condition or navigational position. The report added that the vessel has got severe hull damage in several areas and that all kinds of machineries and operational manuals have been removed from it.Read more: SC slaps ₹50k fine on plea to remove Quran verses, says ‘absolutely frivolous’The senior counsel said that the high court directed the Union defence ministry to take a decision on the representation made by the company to acquire the ship, but that representation was also rejected on November 27, 2020.At this, the court said that it was too late in the day to interfere with the matter now. “We are with you as far as the spirit of nationalism is concerned, but you are already too late in this case. 40% of the ship has been dismantled. We cannot interfere now,” observed the bench.It also told Sharma that her company had not challenged the order of dismissal of the representation by the defence ministry. “The government has already rejected your representation, and there is no challenge to that. You have come too late. We are lifting our stay and dismissing this petition,” it remarked.INS Viraat, India’s flagship aircraft carrier for 30 years, was decommissioned in 2017. It was previously commissioned by the British Royal Navy as HMS Hermes, and was in service from 1959 to 1984.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-paves-way-for-ins-viraat-s-dismantling-101618251577704.html
13-04-2021||India||‘People in Gujarat think they are at God’s mercy’: HC amid Covid-19 surge||The Gujarat High Court on Monday observed that the people of the state were at “God’s mercy” amid the worsening Covid-19 pandemic in the country. The HC’s comments came while it was hearing a suo-motu petition on increasing Covid-19 cases in the state. The court directed the state to take several corrective steps to tackle the situation.Taking note of media reports on the rising number of cases up to 5,000 during last two days and shortage of hospital beds, Remdesivir injections, oxygen, ventilators and vaccines, chief justice Vikram Nath took up a PIL on Sunday while observing, “The state is heading towards a health emergency of sorts.”On Monday, not convinced by the detailed explanations and replies by Advocate General Kamal Trivedi, a division bench of Nath and Justice Bhargav Karia asserted that the reality flew in the face of the state government’s claims.“People now think that they are at God’s mercy,” the bench observed while pointing at several shortcomings in the state government’s handling of the Covid-19 cases.Read more: The Number Theory: Where is the second Covid-19 wave bigger than the first?The HC bench heard out Trivedi but insisted, “The situation is quite different than what you are claiming. You are saying that everything is alright. But the reality is contrary to that.”The court went on to point out that there was a “trust deficit” among the people of the state. “People are cursing the government and the government is cursing the people. This will not help. We need to break this chain of infection,” the court said.The bench refused to accept most of the Advocate General’s explanations on the Gujarat government’s Covid-19 measures, especially on the availability of beds or Remdesivir, a key anti-viral drug that is in short supply.Queues run long outside Ahmedabad’s Zydus Hospital run by Zydus Healthcare that also makes Remdesivir. AG Trivedi denied any shortage of the anti-viral drug and cited expert medical opinion that it should be sparingly used given that it could have adverse effects on the liver and the kidney of the patients.Trivedi told the court that people who do not need the drug were also trying to buy it as a precautionary measure. He stated, “Remdesivir is not required if the patient is under home treatment or is asymptomatic and not critical.”Read more: Political slugfest erupts after Gujarat BJP chief offers free remdesivirHe added that even the supply was limited and said, “Only seven companies make it. The production is just 1.75 lakh vials per day. We are procuring around 25,000 injections every day for Gujarat.”But the High Court wondered if the state government was trying to control the supply of Remdesivir as people were scrambling to get it and even at designated hospitals.“The medicine is available but it is being controlled by the government. Why can’t people buy it? Make sure it is available everywhere. There is no shortage of Remdesivir. Everything is available with you. We want results, not reasons,” the High Court asserted.Gujarat BJP President CR Patil organised some 5,000 vials of Remdivisir and offered to distribute it free to people from the BJP office in Surat, while the state reeled under a severe shortage, triggering a controversy. Chief minister Vijay Rupani and his deputy Nitin Patel said they were not aware of how Patil managed the injections and that it was not part of the state’s procurement. The BJP defended Patil stating that the gesture was for the people of Surat suffering from a shortage of the antiviral drug.Read more: Gujarat government not in favour of lockdown: CM RupaniCongress accused the government of doing politics over the shortage of the drug.The court was also livid over reports that RT-PCR test reports were taking too long. Earlier, the RT-PCR test results used to be available within 12 hours.“It now takes “almost five to seven days”, the bench said, adding, “That is for the common man. For someone like you or Mr Devnani (an advocate party to the case) or us, maybe we can speed up, we can jump the line.”On the state’s health infrastructure, the court observed, “(It is happening because) you did not have the infrastructure. You did not increase the facilities.” This came after Trivedi explained that the delay was because of a large number of samples being currently received by the labs every day.The bench scoffed at the government’s claim that there was an adequate number of available beds for Covid-19 patients. “I have information that patients are turned away even if beds are available at hospitals. If beds are there, then why are we seeing 40 ambulances with patients waiting outside hospitals?” asked Justice Vikram Nath.Trivedi replied that though all hospitals offered similar treatment, people had preferences and this was the reason for a huge rush outside some hospitals.The advocate general said a lockdown was difficult, pointing out that it would increase the miseries of the poor and migrant workers manifold, especially when the industry is in dire straits.The High Court finally asked the government to submit a detailed report by Wednesday and scheduled the next hearing for April 15.Gujarat reported 6,021 new Covid-19 cases and 55 deaths during the last 24 hours as of 5 pm on Monday, its biggest single-day rise since the beginning of the pandemic. The state’s total caseload stands at 3,53,516 while the death toll rose to 4,855 on Monday.The Gujarat HC has been monitoring Covid preparedness in the state since last year and issued a series of directions to the state government in the past year on ramping medical facilities to deal with Covid-19 cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/people-in-gujarat-think-they-are-at-god-s-mercy-hc-tells-state-govt-amid-covid-19-surge-101618247738372.html
13-04-2021||India||In the seas, when the US and India differ on principle||Last week, the United States (US) Navy’s Seventh Fleet put out a routine announcement on its website: “On April 7, 2021 USS John Paul Jones (DDG 53) asserted navigational rights and freedoms approximately 130 nautical miles west of the Lakshadweep Islands, inside India’s exclusive economic zone, without requesting India’s prior consent, consistent with international law.”This announcement may have been one of several freedom of navigation (FON) announcements for the US Navy (USN) but led to a considerable degree of dismay and outrage in India, more so given the recent Quad summit.The external affairs ministry issued a statement asserting that India’s position “on the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) is that the Convention does not authorise other states to carry out in the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and on the continental shelf, military exercises or manoeuvres, in particular those involving the use of weapons or explosives, without the consent of the coastal state.” It further added that Delhi had “conveyed our concerns regarding this passage through our EEZ to the government of the USA through diplomatic channel”. However, the Pentagon defended its Navy, asserting that the actions of its warship were “consistent with international law”.Also Read | India, US to work closely on clean energy: US envoy John KerryWhat explains this US unilateralism and is the Pentagon targeting India alone? A review of navigational rights announcements by the USN since last November indicate that it has conducted such patrols, citing “excessive maritime claims” by many nations including Russia, Japan, China, Vietnam, the Philippines, South Korea, Sri Lanka, India and the Maldives.Traditionally, the oceans of the world have been designated as the global commons and FON is enshrined in customary practice and codified by international law. Any ship that is flying the flag of a sovereign State, and engaged in legitimate maritime activity is not to be hindered on the high seas; this is also the bedrock of global trade. Thus, when there is reference to FON and respecting international law, it usually pertains to the non-military domain.The more nettlesome activity is freedom of navigation operations (FONOP), which are carried out by naval platforms and have come into focus after the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Seas (UNCLOS), which introduced the concept of territorial waters (12 nautical miles from the coast), a contiguous zone (24 nautical miles) and an EEZ that extends to 200 nautical miles.Coastal states can exercise sovereign rights in their territorial waters while allowing for “innocent passage” of naval platforms; they have some policing and pollution/health related enforcement rights in the contiguous zone. The UNCLOS envisaged the EEZ as a region whose natural resources could be exploited but did not confer exclusive sovereignty rights.The rationale for such a classification is that if all EEZ claims of the global community were aggregated, it would amount to almost 38% of the global commons. UNCLOS concluded that restricting access and passage in more than a third of the global maritime domain was untenable.Also Watch | French ships Tonnerre & Surcouf reach Kochi ahead of drill with QUAD naviesUNCLOS was adopted in 1982 but many anomalies came to the fore. The US accepted its provisions but chose not to be a signatory. Countries such as India and China signed up but added their own caveats and interpretation. And hence there was a lack of a consensual interpretation of the EEZ and the rights it confers on the coastal State.In the current instance, the US is sticking by its interpretation of the EEZ and India is pointing to its domestic laws that mandate Delhi’s prior concurrence. Harmonising these divergent positions will be complex and contested but is necessary.It may be prudent for the Quad nations that have emphatically upheld the FON principle and adherence to international law in the Indo-Pacific to decide on “whose” version of the law is to be upheld. Apropos adherence to law, for instance, there are different standards all around — for instance, the US and United Kingdom are yet to accept the UN tribunal ruling in relation to Diego Garcia.While maritime law cannot be divorced from geopolitics and State power, neither can it be devoid of acknowledging the sanctity of principle.C Uday Bhaskar is the director of Society for Policy StudiesThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-the-seas-when-the-us-and-india-differ-on-principle-101618225957103.html
13-04-2021||NA||Highlights: Over 3.7 million Covid-19 vaccine doses administered till 8pm: Govt||A resurgent coronavirus disease (Covid-19) has hit the country hard, leading to swamped hospitals and complaints of scarcity of essential drugs like Remidesivir. The record number of new cases every day has taken the active caseload to more than 1.2 million. It is the second day of Tika Utsav', the mass Covid-19 vaccination programme. The four-day vaccine festival that began on Sunday is aimed at inoculating a maximum number of people against the deadly virus.Globally, the coronavirus disease has affected more than 135 million people and led to nearly 3 million deaths, as per the John Hopkins University Covid-19 tracker. The US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Sunday slammed China for the lack of transparency and called for a deeper investigation to discover the origins of the virus. The concerns about the AstraZeneca vaccine and export restrictions of Europe led Australia to abandon its vaccination target. China's centre for disease control and prevention is considering mixing coronavirus vaccines to improve the efficacy of its current shots, Bloomberg quoted China's top health official as saying.Follow all the updates here:Former HP chief minister Virbhadra Singh tests positive for Covid-19Former Himachal Pradesh Chief Minister Virbhadra Singh tests positive for COVID19(File pic) pic.twitter.com/Oj05UpXzg1Virbhadra Singh, former chief minister of Himachal Pradesh, tested positive for the coronavirus disease, reports ANI.200 people allowed in weddings outside containment zone, Covid appropriate behaviour mandatory: Uttarakhand govtAmid increasing #COVID19 cases, weddings outside containment zones will have a gathering of 200 people, who will have to abide by Covid appropriate behaviour: Uttarakhand GovernmentUttarakhand government said that 200 people, who will have to abide by Covid appropriate behaviour, can gather in weddings outside the containment zones, reports ANI.Pune reports 9,621 new Covid-19 cases and 86 fatalities in last 24 hoursMaharashtra: Pune district reports 9,621 new cases, 8,151 recoveries and 86 deaths in last 24 hours.Active cases: 99,806Total cases: 6,58,014Total recoveries: 5,47,581Death toll: 10,796With 9,621 new Covid-19 cases and 86 fatalities in the last 24 hours, Pune's cases tally reached 658,014 and death toll climbed to 10,796, reports ANI.Uttarakhand logs 1,334 new Covid-19 infections, tally reaches 110,146Uttarakhand reports 1,334 new COVID cases and 7 deaths today; case tally rises to 1,10,146 pic.twitter.com/L4heCE47nJUttarakhand witnessed 1,334 new Covid-19 cases and seven related deaths, taking the state's tally to 110,146 cases and 1,767 deaths, reports ANI.Covid-19 vaccination drive: Over 3.7 million vaccine doses administered till 8pm on Monday#LargestVaccineDrive #Unite2FightCoronaOn an average, 45,000 COVID Vaccination Centres (CVCs) are functional on any given day.

13-04-2021||Today's||Examining the Supreme Court’s approach to Rohingya deportation||The judiciary enjoys an uneasy relationship with international law. While on occasion, courts have made use of international law, including treaty and customary law to enlarge the scope of domestic rights (e.g. Puttaswamy), on other occasions, they have failed to consider the import of such rules. A striking illustration of the latter is the Supreme Court (SC) order rejecting a plea filed on behalf of Rohingya refugees detained in Jammu seeking to stop their deportation to Myanmar. The Rohingyas are a Muslim minority in Myanmar. Following a 1982 citizenship law, they were rendered stateless and have since been subject to persecution. However, from 2016, Myanmar’s army began clearance operations against the Rohingyas, involving mass murder and rape, triggering an exodus to neighbouring countries. In 2020, the International Court of Justice indicated provisional measures against Myanmar for alleged prima facie violations of its obligations under the Genocide Convention. The plea before SC was motivated by reports that 150-170 Rohingya refugees detained in Jammu were going to be deported to Myanmar. The petitioners sought to argue that the deportation of Rohingyas to Myanmar, where they faced threat of persecution, would be contrary to the rule of non-refoulement under international law, which has been recognised by two high courts as part of the right to life under the Constitution. The government opposed the petition on the ground that the non-refoulement principle was only applicable to signatories and that since India was not a signatory to the Refugee Convention (RC), it would not be required to adhere to it. It also argued that there were ensuing security ramifications.Under the non-refoulement rule, states are prohibited from expelling or returning refugees, asylum-seekers, or other persons within their effective jurisdiction to any country where there exist substantial grounds for believing that they would be subjected to torture or arbitrary deprivation of life. Although the rule initially evolved in the context of the RC, it has subsequently been read into other international human rights law instruments such the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and Convention against Torture. The rule has been recognised not only a rule of customary law, but has also arguably been recognised as a peremptory norm. This means that not only does the rule of non-refoulement bind non-signatory States, it also permits no exception. Notably, in the past, India has recognised the customary character of this principle at international forums.SC, in a terse order, did not engage with the issues involved. It observed that India was not a signatory to RC and noted that there were serious objections raised as to whether the treaty could be used to interpret constitutional norms. The court overlooked the contention that the non-refoulement principle was recognised in other instruments (to which India is party), and had, in any case, acquired a customary character and would bind a non-signatory State. SC thus failed to appreciate that treaty law is not the only source of international law and that a State could acquire obligations under customary law. This oversight is striking, and the UN Special Rapporteur, who could shed light on the applicable international law norms, was not allowed to make any submissions.The court also noted that the government had raised security concerns. While RC recognises national security as a limitation to the rule, the norm has evolved beyond the convention and arguably admits no exception. However, even under RC, such security threats are required to meet an objective criterion standard. In other words, the security threat has to be objectively examined on a case-by-case basis. It is difficult to appreciate how the detained Rohingyas, which include children and women, would en masse constitute a security threat. SC finally noted that the detained Rohingyas should not be deported unless the prescribed procedure is followed. The procedure prior to deportation is for Myanmar to confirm that the detained individuals are its citizens. As previous experience demonstrates, this would not pose any difficulty. Unfortunately, the consequences for the deported Rohingyas may be far graver.Jay Manoj Sanklecha is an advocate practising in Mumbai and holds an LLM in international law The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/examining-the-supreme-court-s-approach-to-rohingya-deportation-101618324727697.html
13-04-2021||Today's||RSS: An ambitious agenda for the future||The Akhil Bharatiya Pratinidhi Sabha (ABPS), the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS)’s parliament, at its annual meeting, selected a set of senior officials who will manage ambitious goals that will impact the functioning of the RSS over the next decade and beyond. The most prominent among them is the new general secretary charged with the day-to-day operations of the RSS, the 66-year-old Dattatreya Hosabale, formerly one of its six joint general secretaries. Three of the remaining five joint general secretaries are new and, like Hosabale, relatively young and likely to serve for 10-15 years to implement the RSS’s ambitious agenda. The RSS has an unwritten understanding that officers should consider retiring at about 75.Hosabale’s years at the national level have given him a close familiarity with the broad range of activities — and internal debates — within the 34 members of the RSS family of affiliated organisations that cover fields as diverse as education, labour and politics, among others, and with their senior personnel, including the prime minister, himself a former RSS full-time worker, as well as the senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leadership, the large majority of whom are RSS members.Hosabale himself replaces the 73-year-old Suresh Bhaiyyaji Joshi who moves to the Karyakari Mandal, the executive council of the RSS, as does Ram Madhav, a former spokesperson of the RSS who was seconded to the ruling BJP in 2014 as a national general secretary. Joshi, following four three-year terms as general secretary, opted to retire for health reasons. National officials of the RSS — which demands an arduous travel schedule to give them an opportunity to adopt policies that meet the wishes and demands of the grassroots — require good health and now, even more so, given the group’s future ambitious agenda.Decisions in the RSS and its affiliates are by consensus, and so the national leadership needs to have a comprehensive understanding of important issues at the local level, such as the current debate over agricultural reform, where there are significant differences of opinion within the RSS. This form of decision-making has made the RSS both cautious about change and remarkably free of internal fissures.Hosabale, like Joshi and most national RSS functionaries, is a full-time RSS pracharak, multilingual and with a college education, a Master of Arts in English Literature. He has been affiliated with several activities of the RSS — as a member and later organising secretary of its student branch, the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (while active, he was imprisoned for opposing the 1975-77 Emergency); then in 2003 as the RSS’s joint intellectual secretary (Sah Baudhik Pramukh), in charge of the daily discussions held in the thousands of its daily meeting places across the country; and then as joint national secretary of the RSS in 2009 when Mohan Bhagwat was selected to head the RSS.During Hosabale’s two-day September 2018 visit to the Washington DC area, he demonstrated a desire to hear diverse political opinions about South Asia and its place in the world. I was asked to organise briefings for him on United States (US) foreign policy at my institution, the School of Advanced International Studies of Johns Hopkins University, as well as chair a meeting on Capitol Hill at which he spoke on international relations from the perspective of the RSS. Many of the participants were pleasantly surprised by his request for briefings from a range of American foreign policy experts. One frequent comment to me from the various audiences was that he seemed open to new ideas.Mohan Bhagwat’s annual Vijayadashmi speech in October 2020, which is meant to highlight the organisation’s mission for the future, set the ground for the RSS agenda over the next decade or so. It gave primacy to overcoming the Covid-19 pandemic and supported the government’s lockdowns as necessary. India was praised for fulfilling its historic notion of “Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam (the world is one)” by dispatching serums and medical equipment to other countries. But the situation has since deteriorated with the second wave of Covid-19 hitting India.Bhagwat’s speech pointed out the adverse economic and educational consequences of the lockdown and praised the RSS family of organisations for providing food, shelter, and medicines on a massive scale. The RSS leadership was aware of the adverse consequences of the pandemic on its activities. Its daily shakhas (meeting sites) closed nationally when India locked down and only began to reopen in November 2020; the ABPS report in March 2021 claimed that some 90% were functioning, though the number of members participating is still relatively low. Its affiliated school system, the largest private school system in the country, was also shut down and is only beginning to be reopened. Its sewa (welfare) activities still require massive effort, especially with the recent surge of the pandemic. ABPS recognises that domestic and national security require reducing the threat.Running through the document is a barely disguised sense that the pandemic had its origins in China and that Chinese assertiveness in eastern Ladakh may have been timed to exploit a perceived Indian weakness.The effort to revive — and expand — the RSS presence has resulted in a plan to establish shakhas in every region and every mandal (local administrative centre) within three years. This requires a special effort in the south and in rural areas where the RSS is relatively weak. It will also need to expand officer training to prepare for the anticipated growth in demand (over 6,000 full-time workers now serve in the RSS, its affiliates and overseas).Still another effort at expansion is the campaign to raise money for the proposed Ram Temple in Ayodhya, an effort led by the affiliated Vishwa Hindu Parishad. Thousands of RSS members have been recruited to help. That effort has captured public attention, with a doubling of the initial goal of ₹1,100 crore. And another key mobilisation effort is directed at the forthcoming 100th anniversary of the founding of the RSS in 1925. The RSS also intends to involve itself in efforts to address the scarcity of water and improve soil quality with a range of pilot projects from April 13.Both the Vijayadashami speech and the reports of the proceedings of the most recent ABVP conclave focus on strengthening the family, which the RSS considers the source of stability. This range of activity plays to Hosabale’s organising capacity and is certainly a reason that the senior leadership turned to him and other activists selected to lead the RSS over the next several years.Walter Andersen is a recently retired member of faculty at the School of Advanced International Studies of Johns Hopkins University, and the co-author of The Brotherhood in Saffron: The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh and Hindu Revivalism and The RSS: A View to the Inside The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/rss-an-ambitious-agenda-for-the-future-101618049183384.html
13-04-2021||Editorials||India’s new vaccine regime||The emergency use authorisation granted by India’s drugs regulator to Sputnik V, and the government’s decision to fast-track similar approvals, conditionally, for any Covid-19 vaccines that have the same in the United States (US), United Kingdom (UK), Europe, and Japan, or which are in the World Health Organization’s emergency use listing is welcome. This is a definite step towards increasing access to, and availability of, vaccines — and it is something that the government could have considered a few months ago.There are more things the government can do to enhance access. Vaccine-making is a complex, expensive, and risky business. One of the few things the Donald Trump administration got right was its decision to plough billions of dollars of government funds into vaccine-makers. New Delhi may not want to do billions, but it should take steps to boost the capacity of vaccine-makers, streamline government orders, and arrive at a price that is fair to everyone concerned. This requires working with companies, including many in the private sector, not something that comes easily to an administrative machinery that has, over decades, largely distrusted businesses. The result is usually policies that handicap businesses, where they should be empowering them, and the ultimate price is usually paid by the citizens. Testing is a classic example. With the State regulating prices, there has been little incentive for companies to build scale or invest in technology. And so, even as a second wave threatens to drown India, the country finds itself short of Covid-19 testing capacity. This has resulted in delays, not just in identifying those infected by the virus, but, more importantly, in isolating them so that they cannot spread the disease to others. Sure, the government has to ensure that no one engages in profiteering, especially in the midst of a pandemic, but it should not come in the way of a business making honest profits. The government should follow up on its approval to Sputnik, and the decision to accelerate approvals to vaccines approved in other countries — both steps advocated by many, including this newspaper — with a clear vaccine policy. This should cover all aspects, from capacity building to purchase planning to pricing to even open-market availability. And it must have a singular objective — making sure every Indian who wants a vaccine gets one.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/indias-new-vaccine-regime-101618324068759.html
13-04-2021||Editorials||The perils of the ordinance route||The ordinance route undermines the law-making process, deprives citizens from articulating their grievances through representatives in Parliament when the bill is first conceived and tabled, and presents a fait accompli of sorts. Unless critical, the government must resist promulgating ordinances.As this newspaper reported on Tuesday, based on PRS legislative research data, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government, in its seven years in power, has promulgated 76 ordin-ances. The United Progressive Alliance government, in 10 years between 2004 and 2014, promulgated 61 ordinances. A charitable reading would suggest that the higher figure indicates the government’s desire to expedite legislation to meet challenges. A less charitable reading would suggest that this is in line with the executive’s disregard for the legislature. To be sure, an ordinance — promulgated when Parliament is not in session — has to be passed within six weeks once a session starts.This is also a route that other governments have adopted. And in many cases, ordinances are essential. But this does not take away from its weaknesses. For one, the government has promulgated ordinances on issues that perhaps did not have the kind of urgency that was claimed. Two, while ordinances are passed as laws subsequently, this too is often done in a hurry — PRS data shows that only 25% of the bills went to parliamentary committees between 2014 and 2019, compared to 71% between 2009 and 2014. So not only are more laws being brought in without legislative approval at the outset, they are also not going through adequate scrutiny. And finally, the ordinance route undermines the law-making process, deprives citizens from articulating their grievances through representatives in Parliament when the bill is first conceived and tabled, and presents a fait accompli of sorts. Unless critical, the government must resist promulgating ordinances.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/the-perils-of-the-ordinance-route-101618323581952.html
