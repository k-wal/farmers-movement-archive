It said there was no strong male influence at home to guide the boy. In the second case, it was said that the boy did not go to school or was otherwise employed. The father remained away from home for long hours for work and the mother stayed at home. Therefore, there will be no effective check over whom he could come in contact with. It also stated that the reason for committing the offence was ‘peer-group influence’. The two boys have been in judicial custody since March 2019. On February 18, 2019, four people, including the two juveniles, allegedly attacked a person with a sharp weapon near EWS Colony, Mauli Jagran. Police said the fatal attack had been orchestrated by the victim’s wife in connivance with her paramour.Taking note of the report, the high court bench of justice Jaishree Thakur said if the minors were released on bail, there was a likelihood of them going back to the same environment, which in turn would put them in contact with the same peer group that they were in association with at the time of allegedly committing the offence. “Thus, their release would in fact defeat the ends of justice, as they would be exposed to moral, physical or psychological danger,” the bench added dismissing bail pleas. The court, however, directed that trial be concluded as expeditiously as possible and preferably within four months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/murder-case-hc-denies-bail-to-2-juveniles-in-custody-for-two-years-101617474308720.html

The number of cases reported on Saturday was a steep jump from the 398 cases reported on the previous day, indicating fast transmission of the infection in the urban areas of the city. The increase in Covid-19 cases pushed the daily positivity rate — total number of positives out of the samples tested in a day — to 10.8% from 7.2%. The weekly positivity rate has also reached 7%. Due to the increasing positivity rate, the district health department conducted as many as 6,109 tests on Saturday. Such a high number of tests in a single day was last conducted on December 12 last year. “More tests, both RT-PCR and antigen testing, will be conducted in the urban areas. Cases are mostly emerging from urban areas, especially from the sectors falling under Tigra and Chanderlok urban primary health centres. These health centres cater to people mostly living in condominiums and gated societies,” said Dr Jai Prakash, district surveillance officer for Covid-19. As per the data of the health bulletin, at least 2,426 confirmed Covid-19 cases have been detected in the last seven days, up from 1,446 cases reported the previous week. On person succumbed to the viral infection this week, taking the death toll to 367. Due to the high positivity rate, the health department has increased testing and is focusing on isolating infected people to prevent the transmission. Over 34,275 tests were conducted in the last one week, 80% of which were RT-PCR tests. On an average, 800 antigen tests are also being conducted every day in the densely populated areas of the city. “More tests will be conducted in the areas worst affected by Covid-19 to prevent the infection spread. More micro-containment zones will be drawn up. If adequate tests are not conducted, those infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus will go on infecting others,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer. Currently, Gurugram is among the worst-affected districts in Haryana, which has already been listed as one of the 11 states with grave concern by the Union ministry of health and family welfare. Dr Asruddin, director of health services (training), who has been deputed by the state health department to monitor the Covid-19 situation in Gurugram, was also in the city on Saturday. Controlling the infection spread has become all the more vital now as there has been a surge in hospitalisations following an increase in the number of Covid-19 cases. At least 200 moderate to severely ill patients are currently undergoing treatment in different private hospitals. This has also escalated by 43% from the previous week when the district reported at least 116 patients who are hospitalised for Covid treatment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/with-606-cases-ggm-records-highest-single-day-surge-since-nov-101617473648728.html

The owners will have to stop violations else these properties would be sealed,” he said. Ashish Sharma, assistant town planner, enforcement, said that they were also conducting a detailed survey in private colonies to check violations. “A survey is underway in Palam Vihar where recently, flats were sealed for violations. Commercial activities and OC violations would not be allowed,” he said.

In one case, acid was thrown on two bulls and a cow under Jagdishpura police station limit. Distressing pictures of the ruminates were doing the rounds on social media prompting angry reactions from activists. “An activist Sanjay Malhotra had lodged an FIR on March 24 at Jagdishpura police station against unidentified accused. The two bulls and the cow have been sent for treatment at a center in Dayalbagh. Efforts are on to nab the accused,” said Sunil Verma, incharge of Jagdishpura police station. In another case, three dogs were attacked by acid in Nau Ki Sarai village within limits of Khandoli police station of Agra recently. Vineeta Arora, the city coordinator for Federation of Indian Animal Protection Organisation (FIAPO) flayed the state of affairs when it comes to controlling animal abuse. Arora, who runs a home for stray dogs-- Casper’s Home-- finds police often falling short in assessing the sensitivity of matter. “Recently acid was thrown on three dogs in Nau Ki Sarai village and we approached the Khandoli police. The case was not registered and I have been called again to meet a senior cop,” said Arora. Arora said she has placed her complaint on ‘Jansunvayi portal’ as an alternative. “The villagers claim that thieves coming to village throw acid on dogs. Out of three dogs, one is in critical stage having 65 % burns. But nobody has been arrested so far. Till such accused are handled with toughness, not much could be expected for these speechless animals,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/activists-raise-concern-over-animal-abuse-101617473589964.html

Both his shop and the coolers stored inside it were gutted on Saturday.“I purchased the coolers just two days ago. I had to take a ₹1 lakh loan from the bank to buy these, but it was all for nothing. Both my shop and house are now completely gutted. I don’t know how I will repay the loan. My only source of income is gone and so is the roof over my head. I am left with nothing,” said Kumar.Noor, a differently abled resident, also lost his shop - a general store - and his house in the blaze.“My life has been a struggle right from birth. Despite my limitations, I had just started supporting myself with the help of this shop, and for the first time, there was hope for a better future. Now that too is gone, along with my belongings. My life has never been so uncertain and hopeless,” said Noor.Several residents said that they left their shanties in the initial moments after the blaze only as a precautionary measure since the fire was initially limited to one section. However, with the fire spreading quickly, they lost all their belongings.“My wife, two children and I were all asleep when the fire broke out. We woke up due to the commotion outside. The fire was far away from our shanty and we left it as a precautionary measure. At that moment, we only picked up whatever was in front of us and left immediately,” said Amit, who works in a shoe shop.He said that the blaze grew after LPG cylinders inside the shanties started bursting. “Within minutes, the fire grew tremendously. There was nothing we could do except watch our home and belongings burn away. My years of hard work and earnings disappeared in only a few seconds,” said Amit.On Saturday morning, various residents, NGOs and citizen volunteers gathered at the site of the fire to provide relief and aid.After speaking to the six contractors who owned the shanties as well as those whose shanties and shops were gutted, they said around 184 structures were gutted in the incident. “Through various social media platforms, we have asked people for help and donation and have received a lot of support. Food was procured from two gurdwaras and makeshift tents have been prepared for temporarily accommodating the affected,” said Prerit Rana, chief executive officer (CEO), Agrasar, a non-governmental organization (NGO).Rana said that the NGO and citizen volunteers spoke to the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) officials who have agreed to clear the debris from the area and level the ground with earthmovers within the next two days so that residents can once again have a place to stay.Sarika Panda Bhatt, associate director, Nagarro, who was one of the volunteers providing aid, said that a team of MCG officials, including joint commissioner Hariom Attri, visited the spot and added that the civic body has agreed to clear debris from the area. After the team’s visit, she said the civic body placed portable mobile toilets and drinking water outlets in the area on Saturday evening.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/belongings-livelihoods-lost-shanty-residents-stare-at-uncertain-future-101617473589303.html

Fire department officials said only one person suffered minor burn injuries in the fire which was doused after a nearly six-hour operation.The corrugated tin sheet shanties and makeshift shops had been set up at a vacant plot near the Bengali market and local sabzi mandi in Nathupur village, behind the Sikanderpur furniture market on Mehrauli-Gurgaon (MG) Road. While the fire department claimed over 500 shanties and makeshift shops were gutted in the fire, relief volunteers on the ground said only 184 structures were affected.“We received a call at the sector 29 fire department around 2.08 am. Two fire tenders were sent to the spot immediately. Within a few minutes of the call, bystanders also contacted me about the fire. While I was speaking to them, I could hear loud noises in the background, which sounded like bursting LPG cylinders and hence, more fire tenders were rushed to the spot,” said IS Kashyap, assistant divisional fire safety officer (ADFSO), Gurugram fire department.Fifteen fire tenders, 13 from the Gurugram fire department and two from DLF fire services, were used to douse the blaze, said Kashyap.“Despite continuous dousing operations, sporadic bursting of LPG cylinders aggravated the fire, and we were finally able to control it around 6 am, saving around 400 shanties from harm. By 8 am, the fire was completely doused and subsequently, fire tenders returned,” said Pankaj Prashar, fire safety officer, Gurugram fire department.The fire department said that the blaze is likely to have been caused by leakage in an LPG cylinder or through a short circuit.“We found illegal electrical connections in the shanties. There is a possibility that one of the loose electrical wires had a short circuit which led to the blaze. Our investigation is underway,” said Kashyap.Meanwhile, relief volunteers said they assessed the damage on the ground. “With the help of the six contractors and people whose shanties were gutted, we prepared a list of 184 shanties and shops that were gutted in the blaze. Relief provisions for the affected have been initiated,” said Prerit Rana, chief executive officer (CEO), Agrasar, a nongovernmental organization (NGO).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/hundreds-of-shanties-gutted-in-fire-in-nathupur-101617473588719.html
03-04-2021||Noida||Residents raise concern after sanitation workers set garbage on fire||Residents of Sector 63, who have been complaining of illegal dumping and burning of garbage on the roadside, said they spotted sanitation workers engaged by the Noida authority resorting to the hazardous activity. The residents’ welfare association (RWA) members of Bahlolpur, which further connects to FNG road, on Saturday also shared videos on social media of a sanitation worker burning garbage. Pointing out that garbage dumping and burning have become a major menace in their area, residents said the waste from the local vegetable market was burnt at night and the refuse kept smouldering till morning.“We had been complaining that garbage is often dumped on the roadside and set afire. Just about two weeks ago, a large pile of garbage was set on fire and we had to call the fire department to douse the flames. Officials put the blame on unknown miscreants but we saw the authority’s worker setting the garbage afire. How can we sensitise ragpickers when hired sanitation workers are resorting to this illegal activity,” said Sonu Yadav, vice-president of Bahlolpur RWA, Sector 63, who shared the video on social media.According to environmentalists, the issue is an old one and persists due to lack of sensitisation of sanitation staff.“It’s a continuing issue and happens primarily because the authority has hired contractors to pick the garbage or clean roads and these contractors don’t sensitise their staff. The staff are often clueless about what to do with certain waste, like horticultural or other dry waste, so they burn it. In their mind, they are doing the right thing. The authority must give clear directions to contractors to guide the ground workers,” said Vikrant Tongad, Noida-based environmentalist.He further said garbage burning is one of the most common sights in the city.“Take any random road in Noida, travel for some distance and you will find garbage burning on the roadside at any point of time,” Tongad said.Meanwhile, the officials state that they are taking strict action on the complaint. “The incident was reported from FNG road and we are taking strict action against the supervisor and workers. They have strict guidelines to not burn garbage. We will also ensure that such incidents are not repeated,” said IP Singh, officer on special duty (health), Noida authority.Noida generates around 700 tonnes of domestic waste daily. The door-to-door garbage collection covers 220 high-rises having 140,000 apartments, about 98 RWAs having 40,000 houses and about 70 small and big villages within the city, the officials said. After collection, the garbage goes to 21 different transfer stations of the Noida authority, where the unsegregated waste is separated manually with help of ragpickers and later sent to the main storage facility at Sector 145.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/residents-raise-concern-after-sanitation-workers-set-garbage-on-fire-101617473588187.html

The officials said they have devised a 12-point agenda, which they believe will help contain the virus spread. The high caseload areas were identified on the basis of total cases in the month of March and the two days of the current month. These areas -- Carte (90 cases in March), Raj Nagar (86 cases), Indirapuram (63 cases), Vasundhara (29 cases), Vaishali (51 cases) and Sahibabad (37 cases) -- reported 63% of the total 565 cases in the district the month of March. In the first two days of April, Carte reported 14 Covid cases, Raj Nagar nine , Indirapuram 20, Sahibabad 17, Vasundhara 10, and Vaishali eight new cases. “We have decided to fast-track surveillance measures, contact tracing and facility allocation in these areas. Our rapid response teams will visit these areas within 12 hours of each new case being reported and carry out their procedures. All protocols related to containment zones will be strictly enforced in these areas,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate, Ghaziabad.According to the health department officials, once a person tests positive, the facility allocation is done generally within 24 hours and the next 48 hours are devoted to surveillance and contact tracing. “In high case load areas, these activities will start within 12 hours and this will help in checking spread of infection,” said an official from the district health department. The administration officials further said they will start extensive door-to-door survey in these areas and also step up testing of people with co-morbidities, senior citizens, pregnant women and people having Covid-like symptoms. “We will also take up 100% contact tracing of each patient and they will also be given prophylactics. Besides, our teams will also get in touch with hospitals and chemist shops in these areas to get the details of patients having Covid-like symptoms,” Pandey further said. According to the state control room figures of April 2, Ghaziabad district has seen a total of 27,396 Covid cases of which 355 are currently active cases.

The incident was captured on CCTV cameras and widely circulated on social media. The victim said he was dealing with customers at his shoe shop when the men barged in. “They were armed with sticks and rods and started beating me without any provocation. They also beat up some customers and my staff who rushed to my help,” he said. In the CCTV footage, the victim is seen helplessly defending himself and then fleeing the shop to save his life. Goel said some suspects were trying to extort ₹20 lakh from him and when he could not pay the money, they attacked him. The suspects had reached the shop on three motorcycles and fled the spot after committing the crime. The suspects had earlier made a video call to the victim demanding the money, police said.

Visitors started coming in after November. Though the footfall has increased, it is yet to match to what it was before the pre-Covid era.”The lockdown hit Raghav Modi badly who opened his dream café with his wife in sector 104 in January last year. “I got good response and also got customers from Delhi for the short span my cafe was open. I have again mustered courage and reopened the cafe last month,” he said.Bark Street, a pet-friendly café that was opened in September 2019 and reopened only last month, brings people from across the city as well as Delhi to sector-104. “Lockdown was a low point for all those in the hospitality sector. However, the footfall at our café is better than the pre-Covid era. As we have a unique concept and peculiar décor, we are quite popular on social media, which helps put sector-104 on the map,” says Nikhil Pratap Singh, who runs the café along with three of his friends.Ashish Bhargava, who runs an Instagram page about trendy places in Noida called ‘Noidagram’ with over 60,000 followers, said, “A year ago, sector-104 did not have such eccentric and concept-based cafes. However, with the emergence of ‘insta-worthy’ cafes in the last one year, not only do their pictures get high engagement on social media but also attract youngsters from as far as Delhi. This has made sector-104 market a popular hangout destination now.”It is not just small ventures that are opening up in the sector. Furniture e-tailer WoodenStreet, that has stores all over India, chose sector-104 to launch their store spanning over 3,000 sqft. “We believe the market here has the potential to flourish. We expect the store in sector-104 to contribute around ₹1 crore per month in sales,” said Lokendra Ranawat, CEO of WoodenStreet.The launch of a ‘BYOB (bring your own booze) concept’ kitchen bar here has been a major crowd-puller after the lockdown. “Ever since we started operations in December last year, the business has been thriving. One of the major factors behind this is the concept of BYOB, which cannot be found anywhere else in Noida,” said Sunil, a manager at the joint.The coming up of new joints has also helped older businesses in the area. “Footfall at our restaurant has improved than what it was during the pre-Covid times,” said Kalyani Das , partner of Dasaprakash-- a fine dining South Indian restaurant that opened in sector-104 in 2017.‘Sector 104 is a sought-after location’So, what makes sector-104 this sought after? Monika Rawat, who is the co-founder of India Artisans Studio in the area, “We zeroed in on sector-104 to launch our store because of its location. Since we sell home décor and lifestyle products, we chose this area as it is surrounded by new apartments. However, today, our customer base has expanded to as far as Greater Noida, Noida Extension and Delhi as people find our store accessible and feasible to visit because of the expressway.”Flanked by premium residential societies and located near the Noida-Greater Noida expressway, property consultants term sector-104 as the ‘centre’ of Noida. “The location is accessible to not only those living in Noida but also those living in Greater Noida. Moreover, most young people are now moving to new apartment complexes located along the expressway or in Noida Extension,” says Sumit Rathi, a property consultant.He adds the market has had a quick turnaround in terms of footfall and business after the lockdown.“Starling Mall, which houses premium brands like Oxford Bookstore, Theos bakery and Café Delhi Heights, was a major crowd puller in sector-104 before the lockdown. After the lockdown, this market has expanded beyond that one commercial complex and several more eateries and lifestyle outlets have opened here in the past one year,” said Rathi.Vinod Nagar, a real estate consultant, said the rentals in sector-104 market are one of the highest in the area. “Unlike other commercial complexes in Noida, the rentals in sector-104 market area have stayed as high as pre-Covid times. For per sqft area, the rate is somewhere between ₹150 to ₹200 per month. For a second or third floor, it is between ₹100 to 150 per month. A floor at these spaces is at least 500 to 600 sqft which brings the minimum rental to at least ₹50,000 per month. However, all the premium spaces that are facing the road have a minimum rent ranging between ₹80,000 and ₹1,00,000 per month,” he said.He added most commercial complexes in sector-104 have a high demand despite not having a lift. “Vendors or tenants are ready to shell out ₹75,000 per month for a second or third floor space that does not even have a lift. The demand for this place is growing day by day and right now, all of the premium locations are occupied. Many more commercial complexes are coming up in the area,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/quirky-cafes-and-art-gallery-give-noida-s-sec-140-a-hauz-khas-feel-101617473528648.html

From January to March 2021, 69 people died and 98 people were injured in 155 road accidents in Gautam Budh Nagar. Ganesh Saha, deputy commissioner of police (traffic), Gautam Budh Nagar, said the corresponding period last year saw 241 road accidents in which 123 died and 219 others injured in the district. In 2019, 136 people died and 257 were injured in 289 accidents.“We studied the reasons which led to such accidents and started making corrections. There are around 35 ‘black spots’ or accident prone areas in Gautam Budh Nagar. We have fixed the black spots by placing barricades and dividers. The U-turns too have been made encroachment free. We also conducted awareness programmes which led to positive results,” Saha said. The month-wise data provided by the traffic police department for in Gautam Budh Nagar showed that in January 2021, 50 accidents took place in which 22 people died and 30 others were injured. While 25 people died while 41 others were injured in 59 accidents in February, March saw 22 deaths and 27 people suffering injuries in 46 road accidents. The year 2020 saw a total 380 deaths and injuries to 528 people in 745 road accidents. Rohit Baluja, President of Institute of Road Traffic Education (IRTE), said the number of accident deaths coming down is commendable. ”People had restricted their movement from March-November 2020 due to Covid. Now the traffic runs normally. In this scenario, if the accidents and deaths have decreased, it’s good,” he said. However, Baluja said that many small accidents are not reported to the police, adding that the actual numbers may be higher.The traffic police said that they also conduct enforcement drives and challan violators.

Additional deputy commissioner of police (New Delhi) [Addnl DCP] Vikas Kumar said that the police control room was informed about a quarrel near Samrat Hotel in Chanakyapuri on Thursday. The caller said a man injured in the incident was sent to Ram Manohar Lohia hospital.

He had kept a copy of his Aadhaar card, hotel ID card and ₹300 in the phone’s cover, which too was gone with it. Ram was crying for help when a passerby, Pradeep Singh, stopped to help him, sent him to the hospital and called the police. A case of robbery was registered,” said Kumar.The investigating team scanned CCTV footage in the area and tapped into its network of informants to nab the suspect within 24 hours of the crime, police said.

Sarma’s comments came during an interview with a news outlet.“The Centre might give its directives but in the context of Assam, as on present date, Covid is almost non-existent. So, why this need to create panic among people?” Sarma said.“When the need to wear masks will arise, I will tell people to do so. At present, we have to focus on reviving the economy. If people wear masks how will beauty parlours run? They too need to sustain,” he told the news outlet.The minister’s statement came at a time when several states in the country are witnessing a surge in Covid-19 cases. Assam, however, hasn’t witnessed a similar surge in fresh Covid-19 cases.The daily Covid-19 cases in Assam had fizzled down to single digits last month but in recent days the figure is gradually witnessing an upward trend.On Saturday, the state reported 68 new cases of Covid-19. Assam has 598 active cases of infection at present.

The exams will be held for recruitment against 390 posts of headmasters and 1504 posts of assistant teachers in 3049 government-aided junior high schools of the state. Around 3.25 lakh people are aspiring for the jobs.The teachers posted in the 16 districts that have panchayat polls on April 19, including Muzaffarnagar, Baghpat, Gautam Buddh Nagar, Bijnor, Amroha, Badaun, Etah, Mainpuri, Kannauj, Etawah, Lalitpur, Chitrakoot, Pratapgarh, Lucknow, Lakhimpur Kheri, Sultanpur, Gonda, Maharajganj, Varanasi and Azamgarh are surely to get impacted, said Balaji Tiwari, another such primary school teacher. The teachers say the reason that they were keen to be part of this recruitment process is the fact that eligible assistant teachers of government primary schools getting appointed as assistant teachers in government-aided schools draw a better salary while the teachers of government-run upper primary schools have a chance to become headmasters/principals at these government-aided institutions thereby also gaining both, a promotion and a better salary. “The Exam Regulatory Authority, UP should take a decision in the interest of the affected teachers immediately,” said Abhishek Tripathi, another teacher. However, secretary of Exam Regulatory Authority, UP, Anil Bhushan Chaturvedi said so far no application requesting postponement of the exam date has been received by the authority.

03-04-2021||Chandigarh||Witerati: Of ‘vaxing’ eloquent and ‘valfies’||There was a time when ‘update-ism’ divided haves and have-nots on the basis of status symbols such as a new Merc, Mountain Mansion or Maldives vacation. The pandemic has changed all that.Maldives vacations were gone with the wind, Mercs gathered grime in garages and the recession made maintaining mansions an uphill task.Earlier, ‘selfie-ism’ was made up of prized pixel moments such as the Twitterati’s first ‘shot’ at the Beverley Hills, Broadway or Barcelona games. However, the post pandemic,or rather corona’s second coming, has changed all that. It has tossed up a new emblem for 15 minutes of ‘frame’— the first shot.‘Selfie-ism’ boasts of a new status symbol for segregating haves and have-nots — the vax selfie. Or if I may coin the term — the ‘valfie’! The pandemic’s ‘valfie’ comes in all shapes, sizes and surmises.Of vaccine and verbosityThe first kind of ‘valfie’ is defined by content. This ‘valfie’ narrative exhibits symptoms, not of Covid, but of verbal diarrhoea. In which Twitterati are driven by a new art of lipping: How to vax eloquent.This status ‘update-ism’ or ‘selfie-ism’ suffers from severe symptoms of verbal diarrhoea that spouts or shouts the vaccine’s four Ws – when, where, wows and woes.The nitty-gritty defining this narrative reads thus – a mini essay on the ambience of the clinical destination where the tryst with the vax is kept, a long ‘short list’ of who’s who in the waiting room, portraits with your pet accompanying you in the car for moral support; and a thesis on the mood or Vero Moda you sported on the trip for the prick near your ‘moda’.If you’ve scrutinised a poodle or Persian cat preen ‘n’ pose for the paparazzi at a pet show before being put through a hurdle race, you will get the drift of what this Valfie looks like. The curious case of ‘When Hari Met Vaxy’.Of shots and side-effectsAnother kind of vax selfie is the one defined by intent. This ‘valfie’ endeavours to either inform or inspire.If the ‘valfie’ shows a vaccine recipient flashing a toothy smile exposing all 32 ceramic crowns studding the faux jawline, it is meant to inspire, by assuaging apprehensions as ‘teething’ problems. If the ‘valfie’ narrative reads like a long list of sordid side-effects, then it’s driven by the intent to forewarn, not to make a martyr of your forearm. The curious case of ‘for whom the alarm bells toll’.Of vax and vexWhen the vax comes, can our loud yet loveable ‘Punju’ couple, Lamba ji and Lollita, be far behind!Lollita goggles glacially at Lamba ji getting ready for their first shot. Obviously, this is not a honeymoon-ish first shot, rather the vax first shot, wherein the honey in the nuptial narrative has long since dried many moons ago.“What is this canary yellow shirt for?” Lollita gapes.“Oye, for the vax selfie, honey!” Lamba ji gurgles.“You’re teaming it with a hooker lipstick-red tie?!!!” Lollita looks visibly vexed at his vax wardrobe.“If Trump can carry off this couture, why can’t I?” Lamba ji prattles, piqued.“Dump Trump! To go get protection from corona, must you look like a jaundiced Amaltas tree!”The curious case of ‘who moved my kameez!’chetnakeer@yahoo.com||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/witeratiof-vaxing-eloquent-and-valfies-101617472208983.html

He said with the coronavirus infection again on the rise, the IIT administration started taking utmost precaution to keep the campus free from the infection amid the students returning to the campus. “We ensured that every student coming from home went to a designated isolation ward directly from the main gate, where the swab samples of students with symptoms were taken and sent to AIIMS for the tests,” said Sharma. “If the samples tested positive, we sent the student directly to the super-isolation ward from the isolation ward for the next 14 days,” he added. Considering the seriousness of the situation, Jodhpur Divisional Commissioner Rajesh Sharma and Deputy Director (Medical & Health) Sunil Kumar Bisht visited the campus on Saturday afternoon and reviewed the situation and arrangements undertaken by the IIT administration.“We have asked for a mandatory 10-day quarantine for every student coming from home and have also given directions for random sampling of the staff,” said Sharma. He said as the students from hostels have been reported positive, directions of contact tracing have also been issued to the IIT administration. IIT, Jodhpur has 11 hostel buildings on its campus and with students coming in hoards for practical sessions, the administration has been taking every possible measure to keep the situation under control, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/52-iit-jodhpur-students-who-returned-to-attend-practical-classes-test-positive-101617467875240.html

Despite funding the women’s move overseas, with the hope of joining them later, the men only ended up losing lakhs.In the first case, the son of an assistant sub-inspector (ASI) was duped of ₹12 lakh by his wife, who left for Australia with his financial help. ASI Roshan Lal complained that his son, Rakesh Kumar, was introduced to the woman by his childhood friend. The woman’s father, Pardeep Kumar of Captain Colony, Meharban, told him that she had cleared IELTS, but he didn’t have enough money to send her to Australia for higher studies.But, offered that his daughter will help Rakesh move abroad on spouse visa, if he could bear her expenses. He promised that soon after his daughter completes her first semester, she will marry Rakesh, which will facilitate the spouse visa.The ASI said he spent ₹12 lakh on the woman’s visa application, college fee, laptop and air ticket by selling one of his plots and securing a bank loan. His son married her in January 2020, following which she returned to Australia in February 2020. But thereon, she stopped taking his calls.Meanwhile, her father started demanding another ₹10 lakh for arranging the spouse visa for his son. Realising he was being defrauded, the ASI filed a police complaint on August 25, 2020, and an FIR under Section 420 (cheating) of the Indian Penal Code was registered against Pardeep at the Meharban police station following investigation.In a similar case, the Raikot City police booked a woman of Sodhiwal village, Sidhwan Bet, her parents and two siblings for duping her husband of ₹24 lakh.The complainant, Harvinder Singh of Bank Colony, Barnala, said after he married Manpreet Kaur on March 24, 2018, he spent ₹24 lakh on sending her to Canada, as she promised he would soon join her there on a spouse visa.

While firefighters have been struggling to douse the flames every other day, authorities seem to be oblivious to the damage being caused to the health of residents and the environment at large,” he said.Apart from the legacy waste piled up for years, over 1,100 metric tonnes of garbage is dumped at the site on a daily basis, as the refuse derived fuel (RDF) plant and compost plant established at the site are lying closed since the solid waste management contract, handled by A2Z company, was terminated on February 4 this year.“Fires have been erupting frequently at the site, due to which smoke engulfs the entire area, leading to respiratory problems among locals. The daily waste only compounds our troubles, as it leads to stench, causes breeding of mosquitoes and invites stray animals. Leachate leakage, every time it rains, makes matters worse,” said Rajvir Singh, a resident of nearby Kakka village.Municipal corporation commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal said the civic body was working to appoint a new firm to manage the city’s solid waste and process the legacy waste dumped at the site. “I have directed the fire brigade staff to depute more fire tenders at the spot if required and control the flames as soon as possible,” he added.PPCB to issue noticeTaking note of the frequent fires at the landfill, the Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) will be issuing a notice to the MC due to the damage caused to the environment. “MC will be directed to deal with the waste properly, else it will invite action, including fine,” said Gulshan Rai, chief engineer, PPCB, Ludhiana.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/fire-at-tajpur-landfill-chokes-parts-of-ludhiana-101617469268959.html

The minister was speaking at a webinar organised to inaugurate seven projects and lay foundation for seven others in the state worth over are ₹3,500 crore. Responding to chief minister (CM) Hemant Soren’s suggestion of increasing the annual budget for highway construction in the state, Gadkari said, “When we took over in 2014, the total national highway length in the state was 2,178km and now it is 3,290 km. We have plans to spend ₹1 lakh crore on road projects in the state in three years. Currently, 756km long road projects worth ₹7,500 crore are under way in the state, while projects worth ₹10,000 crore will be approved by year-end.”The event was attended by the Jharkhand CM, besides members of Parliament from the state, including Union tribal affairs minister Arjun Munda.Gadkari, however, advised the CM to expedite the process of land acquisition and forest clearance for road projects in the state, as they were proving to be major causes behind the delay in projects. Elevated corridors to come up in Jamshedpur, RanchiDetailing on the major upcoming projects in the state, the Union minister said work for multi-storeyed elevated corridors in Jamshedpur and Ranchi was expected to begin by year-end. “There have been repeated requests from Ranchi and Jamshedpur MPs for elevated corridors. The detailed project report for double-decker elevated corridor on NH-33 in Jamshedpur is being finalised. Work on it is likely to be started this year. A similar elevated corridor will also come up on Ratu Road Piska More in Ranchi,” Gadkari said.The minister also suggested the state government to provide public works department (PWD) engineers on deputation to National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), the nodal agency of the Union ministry of roads, to work dedicatedly on highway projects in the state. Protect elephant corridors: SorenMeanwhile, CM Hemant Soren raised concerns over loss of tree cover and loss to environment caused due to highway construction, besides demanding the minister to provide high speed corridors to connect the state from neighbouring states in order to promote industrialisation in the state. “The tree cover alongside highways is almost negligible now. We also have elephant corridors in some of the forested areas that need to be taken care of. Upcoming roads are affecting movement of elephants and they are forced to get waylaid and enter urban settlements,” Soren said.The CM also advised officials to look into viability of changing alignment and constructing subways to protect the elephant corridors in the state. Responding to the, issue Gadkari said his ministry has zero tolerance towards loss of tree cover and warned officials and contractors of action if found failing on that front. “The cost of compensatory tree plantation is included in project cost.

The steep growth in positive cases has led to high bed occupancy that has posed a challenge in front of district administrations to set up dedicated Covid-19 hospitals, especially in state capital Ranchi that accounts for over 50% of the state’s total active caseload.Jharkhand’s government-owned premiere medical college and hospital, Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences (RIMS), was now running with full bed occupancy in its intensive care units (ICU). “All beds in Covid-19 ICU are now full. All beds in Covid-19 wards are also occupied. It appears that two Covid-19 wards in the medicine department, which were closed when cases dipped, will have to be made functional. There are paying wards also for stable patients,” said a RIMS doctor deputed in Covid-19 ward.Besides RIMS, Ranchi has currently three government-owned dedicated--Sadar Hospital, CCL’s Gandhinagar hospital and an isolation centre at Khelgaon.The Sadar Hospital has 59 ICU beds, RIMS has 25 and CCL’s hospital has 10 ICU beds. However, ICU facility was not available at the 700-bed isolation centre at Khelgaon.“The isolation centre at Khelgaon is kept ready for patients. Doctors have also been deputed. This centre has oxygen support facility but not ICU beds,” said Ranchi civil surgeon VB Prasad.Jharkhand, after the recently concluded festival of Holi, reported 3,368 cases in the last five days with a daily average of over 673 cases. Ranchi alone discovered 1,822 cases during this period, registering a daily average of over 364 cases.Ranchi has so far reported 36,679 positive cases, including 2,622 active cases, 33,795 recoveries and 262 deaths.On Saturday it reported 472 cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/active-cases-breach-4k-mark-in-state-rims-icu-beds-full-101617469207933.html

03-04-2021||Other||Five years of Prohibition: Govt counts its benefits, Oppn counters with black market charge||PATNAMunni Devi, a 30-year-old woman from Santhal tribe, lives in a small hutment along with her husband Yogendra Soren (37) and two sons Apit 9 and Sagar in Dharhar Jamunia village in Dhamdaha block in Purnea district. Traditionally involved in toddy trade, which served as their only source of income, Munni Devi had to stop selling toddy after Prohibition came into force in Bihar on April 6, 2016.After facing initial hardships, she, aided by self-help group Jeevika, opened a small grocery kiosk in 2018. Recently, Munni Devi took 10 kathas of land on lease and started cultivating maize. She has been linked with a maize producer company. She has also enrolled both her children in school and is able to earn ₹5,650 per month. She is not alone. Ranjan Devi has been running a small grocery shop for two years in her village Khutaha in Kumarkhand block of Madhepura district. With a total investment of about ₹78,000, she manages to earn about ₹7,500 per month. Her family, traditionally involved in toddy sale, too faced initial hardships after the ban on sale of liquor was imposed. “It was difficult to even arrange for two square meals a day for the family of seven,” she recalls. As Bihar completes five years of Prohibition, there has been a raging debate over the success of its implementation amid reports of easy availability of liquor and deaths due to consumption of spurious liquor. However, the Nitish Kumar government has stood firm amid calls for easing total Prohibition. In fact, the Bihar government has intensified its campaign against the illegal trade and started targeting big suppliers instead of small-time smugglers. In the last four months, no less than 15 big liquor suppliers from Haryana, Punjab, Assam, West Bengal and Jharkhand were arrested by the state police. Kumar recently fended off criticism that Prohibition had failed to make any impact and said it would continue in the state in a more stringent manner. “The Prohibition in Bihar was enforced from April 6 in 2016 in the larger interest of the society and it is set to continue. Strong action will be taken against violators,” the CM said at a recent event. Excise and prohibition minister Sunil Kumar, a former director general in Bihar Police, says the ban on liquor has had significant positive impact as far as women empowerment and domestic violence are concerned. “The objective was empowerment of women who were the most vulnerable group alcoholic related violence. As per a World Health Organisation report of 2018, 39% of women faced violence in 2016, which came down to 25% in 2018,” he said. Prohibition has left more money in the hands of families and women and incidents like eve-teasing have virtually stopped, the minister claimed. Saloni Subha, a student of one of Patna’s prominent girls’ colleges, agrees. “The ban on liquor has affected our life in a positive way. I remember that during my school days, when alcohol was not banned, people used to create nuisance on roads and on public transport and misbehave with girls. But now we don’t face all these problems and can move freely,” she says. “We cannot forget the days when most of our family income was spent on liquor. That had changed after Prohibition. However, things are now back to square one now, albeit illegally. The ban has remained only on paper and liquor smuggling is rampant,” said Phudena Devi, a woman who took active part in the anti-liquor agitation at Konar village, located 12 km away from Sasaram district headquarters. “The environment was scary earlier. Women would face violence at home as well as in the village. Drunk men would harass us when we went out into the fields to relieve ourselves. We wouldn’t let girls’ study earlier. Our honour is everything for us. But after Prohibition, there is security for women. And there is more money for food and education,” says Ranjan Devi. Meanwhile, under fire from all quarters on the easy availability of liquor in state, the NDA government in the state has intensified its crackdown on the liquor mafia since it took charge in November 2020. “Since January till March this year, 4,41,053.76 litres of liquor have been seized; 2,788 people have been arrested and 877 vehicles used in carrying liquor seized,” said excise commissioner B Kartikey Dhanji. However, the Opposition is not impressed. “No less than 50 lakh litres of IMFL has entered Bihar ever since Prohibition was imposed in the state. A parallel economy is running in the state,” said RJD’s Tejashwi Yadav, also the leader of Opposition. The excise minister concedes there are shortcomings. “It’s a social legislation. There will be violations. We are now trying to hit the supply chain,” said the minister. “By and large, the five years of Prohibition have been effective. It has helped the state on various social parameters. Domestic violence has come down, women empowerment has increased and women have started feeling safe. But the government needs to curb illegal supply of liquor and become stricter while imposing punishment on violators,” said Gyanendra Yadav, associate professor and head of sociology department, College of Commerce in Patna.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/five-years-of-prohibition-govt-counts-its-benefits-oppn-counters-with-black-market-charge-101617468667993.html

Similarly, bills were passed without prior discussion. Though I am aware that shoes were hurled, I have not done it. I only threw a headphone,” he said.BJP MLA Jayanarayan Mishra said the Speaker’s conduct of the Assembly was not appropriate as all the rules and norms were being flouted. “No permission was granted to the Leader of Opposition to speak in the House. The Speaker doesn’t have the minimum qualification to hold the post,” said Mishra.After an adjournment motion brought by the Congress over mining was rejected by Patro, the ruling BJD got two bills passed - Lokayukta Amendment Bill and Societies Registration Amendment Bill. The opposition alleged that the bills were passed without any debate.The situation turned ugly when some BJP MLAs stood on their seats and hurled shoes, papers, pens and earphones at the Speaker as a mark of protest.Government chief whip Pramila Mallick alleged that shoes, earphone and papers were hurled by the deputy leader of opposition Bishnu Sethi, BJP MLA Jaya Narayan Mishra and opposition chief whip Mohan Majhi. All three have been suspended from the Assembly. However, the suspension order could not take effect as the Budget session of the Assembly concluded, five days ahead of the schedule.Meanwhile, BJP members staged a demonstration near the statue of Mahatma Gandhi on the Assembly premises, protesting the suspension order.“I am not favouring the shoe hurling incident. We could beg an apology for any such incident but I am unaware of who all were involved in the incident. But the Speaker has curtailed all the constitutional guidelines today. He is acting like a worker of a party. As a Leader of Opposition, I was not allowed to speak. The bills were passed arbitrarily amid heavy ruckus. On Monday, we will meet the Governor and apprise him about arbitrary passing of bills,” Leader of Opposition Pradipta Naik said. He added that the BJP members would spend the night at the statue of Mahatma Gandhi statue in the Assembly premises and hold a press meet at 10 am on Sunday at BJP state headquarters.BJP MLA Jayanarayan Mishra said he does not care about the suspension. “We are opposing injustice in the Assembly. If I am suspended for opposing injustice, I would welcome it. The Speaker didn’t allow any of the Opposition members, including the Leader of Opposition, speak during the passage of the bills, which is unconstitutional,” he said.Mohan Majhi said, “Today is a black day for Odisha as the Speaker has murdered the democracy by gagging the Opposition. I don’t repent or bother about the action taken by the Speaker today”.Senior Congress leader Narasingha Mishra condemned the incident and called it “an unfortunate development”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/shoes-pens-hurled-at-odisha-assembly-speaker-bjp-mlas-face-suspension-101617465550125.html

The first day of what many believed as “mini-lockdown” on Saturday also saw deserted roads during evening and shutters of cinema halls and restaurants down at many places across the city. The administration, however, has decided against imposing complete lockdown similar to last year even as Covid positive cases are rising sharply in Pune. During the morning hours at Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) headquarters bus stop, there was a long queue of health workers from various hospitals planning to return home after completing the night duty. At Swargate bus stop too, there was crowd waiting for the public transport utility buses. “I came from Kolhapur in the morning and was waiting for PMPML bus to go to Pimpri. However, upon arrival I got to know that PMPML has suspended its service as part of fresh curbs,” said Vilas Sontakke, an engineering student. At Swargate state transport bus stand, there was more than usual rush with many seen leaving for hometown. “I was planning to return home in June for a few days. However, I had to advance the plan as it seems there will be lockdown again. The restaurant where I was working is closed for a few days,” said Nagesh Uttargi, a Hubli resident working as waiter in one of the restaurants. By evening, some roads in the city witnessed heavy traffic as people were rushing home before the 6pm curfew deadline came into effect. At DP road near Rajaram bridge, there was heavy rush of people scrambling to return home before the curfew was imposed. Post 6pm, police vans were seen roaming around in many parts of the city asking shops to down shutters. At some places, there was chaos with people rushing to grocery stores during evening when the curfew came into effect. Some grocery shop owners too returned to the old practice with customers standing outside in designated box painted by shop owners. Wholesale stores in Market yard were also seen serving many customers, more than the usual numbers, as the chief minister in his address to state on Friday evening warned of complete lockdown in the coming days. At Market yard, many godowns were seen piling products, with goods being unloaded and families making a beeline to stock up groceries for the coming weeks.“With the announcement of curfew, we decided to stock for at least a month unlike last time when it was difficult to source things,” a resident said.DMart at Satara road as well as Aundh and Baner also witnessed long queues of shoppers and the staff were assisting people in maintaining social distancing.Many cloud kitchens were also facing problems. “Cloud kitchens which are allowed to do delivery of food are being asked to put down shutters at 12 noon only when the order says 6 pm onwards, while delivery is allowed through online delivery channels,” said Renuka Agarwal, who runs a kitchen in Dhanori. Impulse shopping has made people rush to shops and malls as many were seen buying vegetables and essentials for a month.Rahul S waited in a queue to get essentials for his baby daughter. “I want to make sure we have enough of the necessary baby things during this period,” he said. This time though there were hardly any queue outside liquor shops. “The curfew announcement has hit us bad too, for we have to shut shop by 6 pm. Though towards closing time we get some regular buyers, but it seems that people are abstaining from drinking,” said Raju Bhagya of GSP Wines. Restore PMPML service: BJPThe Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) staged an agitation on Saturday with leaders Pune MP Girish Bapat and city unit chief Jagdish Mulik demanding restoration of PMPML bus service. “Government does not realise that by suspending PMPML bus service, many workers who travel to the city from far-off areas will face inconvenience. We have submitted a memorandum to Pune divisional commissioner Saurabh Rao to restore the public transport utility service,” Bapat said.With inputs from Prachi Bari||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/first-day-of-restrictions-in-pune-people-scramble-for-essentials-health-staff-stranded-at-bus-stands-101617464407870.html

However, for special students who have hearing, visual and learning disabilities, these challenges have been multi-fold. Teachers struggled to clarify concepts for special students through the virtual medium. Maharashtra has 8,196 special students appearing for the Secondary School Certificate (SSC) and 6,087 special students appearing for the Higher Secondary Certificate (HSC) scheduled from April end. Pune division alone has registered 859 students in HSC and 1,074 students in SSC as per the state board. Athang Bhandare, a visually challenged student of class 12 Arts said that as the entire academic year was online, the exams should be too. “Online examination would be better. Even though I am in Pune, I live far away from my college; going there itself is a challenge. There is a problem of transport and the fear of Covid-19. My parents also are scared about how I will give the paper. I also feel that the paper should be online with multiple choice questions (MCQ),” said Bhandare. He added that getting a writer is important in offline and online mode. “Not all software supports a talk back. So, there is a need for a writer. In my case, my sister is writing for me but for my other friends who are living in Latur and Hingoli, they have to get a writer who is in Pune. They haven’t found writers,” said Bhandare. Meera Badve, director of Nivant Andh Mukta Vikasayala said that students have struggled a lot to get a hang of difficult concepts this year. “It is difficult to teach various concepts to special children. For example, special students with visual disabilities, how can we explain the concept of planes in Mathematics or finance in commerce? All of this we have done at offline classes so far, and in the last one year, there was no option for these students to learn everything online. There were challenges, and now the syllabus is almost finished but there is less time for the child to revise,” said Badve. She added that final exams should be taken online to make things easier for the students. “There should be question banks and the students should get multiple choice questions to make the paper easier. Many students with special needs are living in rural parts. If the exams are offline, how are these students going to manage to come and give the exam in the city?” questioned Badve. She added that as the hostels are shut and the hostel mess are also shut, where will the students stay to give the offline examination? “There is also the question of writers. How can the schools and college arrange for writers during the pandemic?” said Badve. Medha Kulkarni, managing trustee of NGO Make My Dream Foundation who works with students of hearing disability said that students with hearing problems have suffered more. “These students, unlike visually challenged students, cannot listen and learn. Teachers have struggled to reach them. Many parents are still confused if the students have understood the concepts or not. In such a scenario, how can the offline examination help these students,” said Kulkarni. Prakash Mali, a class 10 student who is visually challenged said that he is preparing his best for the upcoming examination. “Online learning has its own challenges, and it took us a few weeks to get accustomed to it. Now, that exams are here, for online or offline, we will need writers. As some software don’t support screen readers. So, in that case, we will need a writer to help us. The pandemic is a difficult situation, let’s see how things go for offline exams,” said Mali.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/specially-abled-children-narrate-challenges-of-online-education-101617464287757.html

The city police however maintained that currently there are no plans to reintroduce the practice.Ravindra Shisve, joint commissioner (law and order), said, “Presently there are no plans to start the e-pass system.”“During the curfew period, only those engaged in essential services are allowed to commute. But common people could have a genuine reason to travel. So the e-pass system should be introduced,” said Sachin Patil, an IT engineer from Hinjewadi.“During the next seven days, this is going to major challenge as there are many people with ailments, pregnant women, senior citizen, children and ill patients who need to step out during night time. We request the police to adopt a humane and kind approach towards such genuine cases,” he said.Last year during the Covid outbreak Pune city police had asked citizens to apply online for getting permissions for vehicle movement during the lockdown.The stated aim was to facilitate digital pass/permissions where citizens filled in details on www.punepolice.in If approved, the citizens received an SMS with a QR code that was shown to policemen whenever asked.

Holding a virtual meeting on March 27, the energy minister pulled up the officials for tardy progress of the OTS, warning that the performance of the scheme would be linked to their performance. Giving discom-wise OTS figures, he said, “The Agra discom’s progress is 20.39%, Lucknow discom’s 17.25%, Varanasi discom’s 15.75%, Meerut discom’s 35.29% and KESCO’s 57.40% even as the scheme is going to end.” UPPCL announced the one-time settlement (OTS) scheme in the end of February for all urban and rural domestic consumers as well as private tube wells (farmers) providing for 100% waiver of surcharge/interest on their electricity dues provided they cleared the principal amount at one go by March 31. Devraj said while the OTS this time had evoked the best-ever response, there was certainly scope to do even better by encouraging more consumers to participate in the scheme. “This is why we have extended the OTS till April 15, asking our engineers to reach out to more consumers and ask them to avail the opportunity,” he said. Though the cash-strapped UPPCL brings the OTS almost every year to boost its revenue, the UP Electricity Regulatory Commission (UPERC) in 2018 said the OTS was a bad practice that benefited dishonest consumers who did not pay their bills regularly in anticipation of the OTS. The commission ruled that in future it would not allow the UPPCL to include its loss of interest/surcharge on defaulters’ bills into its deficit to claim higher tariff to make up for the deficit later. “In 2019, the UPPCL recovered ₹3,700 crore dues from 22 lakh consumers but also ended up surrendering ₹1,800 crore interest on defaulters’ bills because of its inability to make them pay their dues regularly,” people dealing with the issue said. Devraj said the financial position of the UPPCL was certainly not good and urged consumers to pay their bills regularly on time to enable the corporation to provide better services including uninterrupted power. “Now, we have asked discoms to ensure that each field employee contacts at least ‘five never paid consumers’ everyday under his jurisdiction, encouraging them to clear their pending dues and disconnect their power supply if they do not oblige,” he said. As per the status till five months ago, as many as 82.27% of rural consumers had not paid even a single electricity bill since April 2020 while only a little more than 17% of the total around two crore rural consumers had paid their bills at least once during the same period. “Now our focus is on these ‘never paid consumers’ both in the villages and cities,” Devraj said. He said UPPCL had abundant electricity to meet the summer demand. “The only thing is that the electricity we supply must be paid for,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ots-evokes-best-ever-response-uppcl-101617463867743.html

The agenda was to discuss preparations for the 400th birth anniversary of ninth Sikh Master Guru Teg Bahadur.At the meeting, SGPC honourary chief secretary Harjinder Singh Dhami proposed that all those present endorse the resolution that the general House of the gurdwara management body had passed on March 31. The resolution was against the Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh (RSS) and claimed that it was attempting to establish a ‘Hindu Rashtra’ (Hindu country).Accepting Dhami’s proposal, all attendees endorsed the resolution by raising their hands, amid chants of ‘Sat Sri Akal’. SGPC president Bibi Jagir Kaur was not present in the meeting. In response to the resolution, RSS has said that the SGPC was raising the bogey of ‘Hindu Rashtra’ to cover up its failures. In his address to the gathering, Akal Takht acting jathedar Giani Harpreet Singh touched upon this issue without naming the RSS. “At the time of the martyrdom of Guru Tegh Bahadur Sahib, communalism was rampant. The rulers of the time were forcibly converting Hindus. The ninth Guru defended the religion by his martyrdom. Even today an atmosphere of communalism is being created in the country and minorities are being oppressed under the patronage of the government. This is not right,” he said.The jathedar added, “Seeds of hatred are being sown in the minds of people of one religion against people from other religions. The few bad elements doing this have the patronage of the government. I appeal to the entire Sikh panth to unite at this time. when attacks are being launched directly and indirectly.” In October 2019, the jathedar had sought a ban on the RSS, saying, “Its aim of a Hindu Rashtra is against the country’s interests.”At the gathering, representatives of Sikh bodies also passed a resolution expressing their commitment and cooperation to the 400th celebrations. They added whatever work the SGPC would allocate to them for the event, would carried out with responsibility and enthusiasm.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/sikh-bodies-endorse-sgpc-resolution-on-rss-bid-to-create-a-hindu-nation-101617463628528.html

03-04-2021||Pune||Parents unhappy over decision to scrap final exams for classes one to eight||Parents in the city are unhappy about the decision to promote all students from class one to class eight without any examination. On Saturday, Maharashtra education minister Varsha Gaikwad announced on the backdrop of rising cases of Covid-19 that students from class one to class eight will be promoted without any examination. The decision for class nine and class 11 will be taken soon, said Gaikwad Archana Kakade, a city-based parent said that schools should conduct online examinations for students. “The entire year has been online so what is the harm in taking online examinations. At least on the backdrop of examination, students will remain engaged and try to clarify the concepts. Classes one to eight are crucial in building the concept of the child and so online examinations should be conducted,” said Kakade. She further added that if the students have to pass without any examination, then why are parents paying exorbitant fees? “Though this year, the increase in fee was not imposed but the existing fee for library, sports and other activities were included. In such a scenario, if the schools are not even conducting examinations, then why are we paying them the fees? The students prepare and work hard because of the fear of examination. In such a scenario, the examination should not be cancelled,” said Kakade. Another parent, Mrunal Kulkarni, said that examinations are a crucial part of the curriculum. “If schools can teach online, conduct the midterm exams online, then they should also conduct the final exams online. Exams help students understand where they lack. In any case, under the Right to Education (RTE), students were promoted till class eight. So why not conduct the exam and then promote students,” said Kulkarni. Jayashree Deshpande, president of the parents’ association of Pune said that if the school is not taking any exam, then why are parents paying such huge fees to the school? “I firstly condemn the brutal violence of students who were protesting at Mumbai against offline examination. Secondly, if all the schools are just going to promote the students to the next class without examination, then what is the point? The schools should conduct online examinations for class one to class eight. These standards are important for the overall education of students,” said Deshpande.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/parents-unhappy-over-decision-to-scrap-final-exams-for-classes-one-to-eight-101617461707668.html
03-04-2021||Pune||Experts: Online education adversely affected students in pandemic year||According to teachers and experts, online education throughout the year has adversely affected students’ abilities to learn and grasp various things. The lack of understanding among students about various topics and subjects came to fore during various assessment exercises for class X and XII. This has led to worries among teachers and parents at a time when final exams are approaching. Speaking about the performance of his child, a city-based parent Manoj Tangadpalliwar said that there was no way of clearing the doubts of the child this time. “My son is in class 12 and it is not prepared for the upcoming examination at all. He has not done even a single offline practical this time, and many concepts of Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics are not clear to him as the classes were completely online this time,” said Tangadpalliwar. He added that during online classes, not all children could clarify their doubts. “Now, that the examination is just three weeks away, the students are asked to complete the practical journals. They have not performed even one practical even after the schools started offline classes briefly. During the offline classes, teachers focused on other syllabus completion and then immediately the schools were shut due to a surge of Covid-19 cases,” said Tangadpalliwar. Talking about how online education has been ineffective, Hearmb Kulkarni, director, strategy and education technology, Council for Creative Education (CCE), Finland who works actively in the field of education said that last year when online classes started, the teachers were not ready to start online education. “There has been no training for teachers as to how to teach online. Their teaching is restricted to using different platforms and teaching through presentations, but this is not sufficient to keep the students interested in online education. The focus of teachers should have been on skill-based teaching last year,” said Kulkarni. He added that his team did a small survey among teachers last year. “Many teachers noted that students do not pay attention during class. They mute the teachers or browse through internet while the teacher is teaching. All of this happens due to the teaching technique being only theory based,” said Kulkarni. He emphasized that students should be taught in asynchronous teaching process so that they get a clear understanding of the concepts. “75 percent teaching should be asynchronous, that is concepts should be taught by easy experiments that students can do at home. As students participate, all of this becomes easy for them to understand,” said Kulkarni. Medha Sinnarkar, principal of Apte Prashala said that though online education was a challenge, the focus of the teachers was to clarify doubts of the child. “As the schools started offline, more students participated. We immediately started revising important topics. Our teachers also clarified doubts as per examination pattern. We started taking writing practices, the revision helped from offline classes,” said Sinnarkar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/experts-online-education-adversely-affected-students-in-pandemic-year-101617461347614.html

The NIA court has also directed the agency to submit a detailed report on Vaze’s health with specifics of health conditions and ailments on April 7, the last day of custody, ANI reported.The court was also informed that the federal agency has found that an amount of  ₹26.50 lakh was withdrawn from the joint bank account of Sachin Vaze and his aide on March 18, five days after his arrest, according to news agency to PTI.Earlier in the day, the special court also allowed the application of Sudharam and let him meet Sachin Vaze for five minutes to hand over fresh clothes in the courtroom.Sachin Vaze was arrested by the NIA on March 13 for his alleged role in abandoning a Mahindra Scorpio with 20 loose gelatin sticks and a threat note near industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s residence in Mumbai on February 25.Additional Solicitor General Anil Singh, the NIA lawyer, said the agency had recovered incriminating evidence such as digital video recording (DVR) of CCTV footage and laptops and it needed to be examined, according to PTI.The NIA took Sachin Vaze to Mithi river near Bandra-Kurla Complex last week and recovered two CPUs of computers, the number plate of a vehicle, two DVRs, and a laptop among other things.The suspended Mumbai Police officer was also named by the wife of Mansukh Hiran, the Thane auto parts dealer who claimed ownership of the sports utility vehicle found outside Ambani’s home and was found dead in a creek a week later on March 5.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/sachin-vaze-s-brother-says-have-complete-faith-in-nia-judiciary-101617459348529.html
03-04-2021||Mumbai||Maharastra may divert all oxygen supply for medical use: Uddhav Thackeray||With Maharashtra recording over half of the daily coronavirus cases in India, the state government is considering diverting all industrial use oxygen supply for medical use, Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray said on Saturday.In an online interaction with newspaper owners, editors and distributors, Thackeray said a decision on imposing stringent measures to tackle the pandemic will be taken soon but did not confirm if there will be a statewide lockdown.Maharashtra on Friday reported 47827 new cases, the highest daily rise in around six-and-a-half-months and a chunk of the 89,129 new cases in a day recorded in India.With the demand for oxygen surging, the state public health department had last month directed oxygen manufacturers to divert 80 per cent of their stocks for medical use and retain the rest 20 per cent for industrial purposes.Thackeray said the state government is considering diverting even that 20 per cent for medical use, because of the surge in cases and the "alarming" situation in the state.The daily demand for oxygen in Maharashtra has touched 700 metric tonnes against the state's production capacity of over 1200 metric tonnes, an official said.A notification stating 80 per cent of capping for medical use was issued on Tuesday. It said that the rule would apply to all of Maharashtra and stay in force till June 30.Thackeray said the state government is increasing testing and also not keeping "even a single positive" case under wraps.The government is also considering steps like opening e-ICUs and increased use of telemedicine in these trying times, he said."If there comes a time when someone's livelihood has to be snatched, there is bound to be anguish. But if there is a dilemma on whether to save a life or a job, then it is important to give priority to life," Thackeray said."We have been telling people since last one year. I feel that if all people, be it private offices or shops, had implemented our directives of staggered duty hours, then maybe the situation would not have reached such an alarming level," he said.The chief minister said office timings should have been divided into 24 hours. "If staggered timings had been followed, there would have been less strain on local trains and BEST city buses. Unfortunately, this did not happen," he said."We have also stressed on wearing masks, using hand sanitisers and keeping a safe distance. Even the WHO says so. It says that even a person who has been vaccinated needs to follow these rules," Thackeray said."So it is not that we did not try. Last year we sent teams to houses. It was possible as there was a lockdown. Even contact tracing of affected persons has become difficult now," he said.Referring to election rallies in some states amid the pandemic, Thackeray said, "In other states, political rallies of thousands and lakhs of people are happening, but the coronavirus cases are more in Maharashtra than these states."He said the media should make people aware that the fight against coronavirus is not only the responsibility of the government but also of the masses. Fear of coronavirus from the minds of people should be replaced by awareness about the pandemic, he added."There should be no politics in this fight against coronavirus," Thackeray said, in an apparent reference to the claim by BJP leaders over his government's handling of the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharastra-may-divert-all-oxygen-supply-for-medical-use-uddhav-thackeray-101617460042392.html

The summer schedule of domestic flights for the next seven months (March 29 to October 26) does not have any flight to or from the district. Bathinda airport director Varinder Singh has confirmed the schedule, adding that it was only district in southern Punjab with air connectivity. Alliance Air (AA), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Air India, was the sole service provider from Bathinda. Air service to Bathinda was started as part of Centre’s ambitious regional connectivity scheme (RCS) of Ude Desh ka Aam Naagrik (Udan) under which the fares were kept low.Sources said that AA chose not to extend operations after the contract ended last year. The airline had discontinued air services on the Delhi route from November 28, 2020, whereas flights to Jammu were suspended on October 27, 2019. Flights from the Bathinda airport were grounded after a lockdown was imposed due to the coronavirus outbreak in March 2020.Before the suspension of the flight service, Bathinda-Jammu flight was operating five days a week, barring Tuesday and Thursday.“In January this year, the authorities had written to two private players to consider running the Delhi-Bathinda flight after the AA decided to stop services,” the airport director said, adding that there had been no response yet. “Only chartered planes have used the airport over the past few months,” he added.Set up at a cost of ₹5 crore at Virk Kalan village, about 30km from Bathinda city, in October 2012, the airport is adjacent to the Indian Air Force station in Bhisiana.Bathinda was connected to New Delhi with a thrice-a-week schedule and the route had an average occupancy of 80%. Flights to Jammu had an average occupancy of 70% with most visiting the pilgrimages of Vaishno Devi and Amarnath. Sources added that with fully functional central institutes like the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) and Central University of Punjab, Bathinda district had a lot of scope for growth in air connectivity, especially from Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/no-regular-flights-from-bathinda-at-least-till-october-26-101617459608570.html

The incident took place on March 28. “We have arrested one student and booked him under rape charges. Four other students are being questioned. Further investigation is on and more arrests could happen,” superintendent of police (SP), Kamrup, Hitesh Chandra Roy said. Mukut Baishya, in-charge of Amingaon police outpost in Kamrup district, said that the statement of the victim was recorded on Saturday, six days after the incident. Police refused to divulge details of the victim and the accused since the matter is under investigation.The IITG authorities, in a statement, mentioned that they submitted a report on Friday after conducting an internal inquiry into the matter. Officials didn’t divulge any details of the report. Though the IITG claimed having filed an FIR in connection with the case, the police denied it. “They just submitted their internal inquiry report. We had registered the case on March 29 and the student was arrested based on our investigation,” said Baishya. Also read: EC tones down gag order on Himanta Biswa Sarma to 24 hours after apologyThe incident happened on the day of Holi (March 28) at the institute’s campus. The victim was admitted to the IIT-G hospital and was later taken to Guwahati Medical College Hospital (GMCH) for treatment. On Saturday, the institute issued a statement and termed the incident “unfortunate” without giving details of the assault or the nature of the victim’s injuries. However, doctors at the GMCH said that it was very likely a case of serious sexual assault. “The victim was brought to GMCH around 12:50 am on March 29. She was initially unconscious and in a state of shock after regaining her senses. She told doctors on duty that she had been sexually assaulted. We immediately followed protocol and carried out a test by a gynaecologist as well as a forensic examination,” said a senior GMCH doctor on condition of anonymity. “However, she was taken from GMCH by IIT-G authorities later in the day saying she will be treated at the institute’s hospital. Since this was against our advice, we immediately informed the local police about it,” he added. Though the victim’s medical report is yet to be out, GMCH sources said that it was a clear case of sexual assault. It is believed that the victim was given some drink laced with drugs or was forced to consume alcohol before the assault. Since the incident took place at the IIT-G, the Bhangagarh police station (the closest to GMCH) informed the Amingaon police about it as the institute falls under the latter’s jurisdiction. “The student is now safe and recovering well,” said the IIT-G statement, adding that her parents have been informed about the incident. It mentioned that the victim, as well as her guardians, refused to file an FIR and asked IIT-G to take up the case. “The fact-finding committee, which was constituted on March 29, submitted its report to the institute on April 2 pm while the institute has filed an FIR. The police have initiated their investigation and the institute is providing full cooperation,” the statement read. In a similar incident that took place years back in February 2017, two students of IIT-G were arrested for allegedly raping three girls of Gauhati University by lacing their drinks with drugs during ‘Alcheringa’, the institute’s annual cultural festival.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/iitguwahati-student-allegedly-raped-student-arrested-101617458708318.html

03-04-2021||Pune||Startup mantra: Enabling a smart reading of map data||PUNE An avid Geography-subject lover, Abhishek Rathod has chosen a path very few entrepreneurs dare to take – of doing business with the government. Iowaaska Technologies is a deep-tech, product-based, startup building a robust Geographic Mapping Intelligence platform named “Intelligent Map”, with cloud-based and near real-time technologies. In the beginningAbhishek Rathod is originally from Gujarat, but his family settled in Pune. Rathod did his schooling from MIT Gurukul and later went to study BA Geography from the Sir Parshurambhau (SP) College. Having a geographer’s background, Rathod also enrolled for an MSc in GeoInformatics course in Symbiosis College. Says Rathod, “I was very bad in Science, so I shifted to Geography in Arts. Later I shifted to Science again as there were not many avenues in Geography. Since I loved Geography and always wanted to work or do business which involved that subject. So, the combination of Science and Geography led me to explore the Geographic Information System (GIS) Mapping and Geospatial industry.”“My dad is a government consultant for ILS Law college for hardware and software infrastructure. He also wanted me to go into business. Coming from a business family background and being brought up in that environment from childhood, helped me to start my own ventures at a very early stage. I did get many opportunities to work abroad, but I want to work for our country and hence, I decided to stay back. So far, I have nine years’ experience of working with international companies and government institutes.”Early business lessonsRathod says, “From childhood we are seeing Google Earth which was first developed by the US Navy and later, it was commercialised and available for common citizens. I wanted to create something similar for our country. During the Covid crisis and the challenges at international borders, the Indian government banned several Chinese applications. What if in the future other countries take some detrimental actions due to which their apps need to be banned? The entire Indian business ecosystem will collapse, but if we have indigenous technology-based applications then we can sustain the ecosystem. So our vision is to create a Geographical Information System (GIS) eco-system for analytics and effectively transform the decision making process. We are on a mission to empower global employment with GIS-driven technology while consulting national and international communities with better environment and self-sustainable living.”“I started my first company Arianrhod GeoSpatial Solutions. It failed as I was driving that company with the service sector. I suffered huge losses while doing surveys for the national highways, coal mining, etc. After learning my business lessons for three years, my advisors suggested I close down the company. After my service-based business model failed, I started to work on the product-based model and Iowaaska Technologies was formed in 2018,” says Rathod.Understanding importance of productOn his team building experience, Rathod says “Currently, we have about 10 members in our team including Rinkal Pramani, Akshay Morab, Shaik Najeebuddin , Abhimitra Birru and Ajay Morab. We have engaged interns too. We are working on the B2G2B model and hence, it is very important to generate revenues as we deal with the government sector. We are focussing on advisors and consultants rather than hiring salaried employees. Our advisors are Dr Suyog Lohakare, Jasraj Kalaskar and Rishab Malhotra.”Explaining the importance of product-based startup, Rathod says, “Our first project was providing consultancy to government agencies and it was during this first project we understood the importance of the product. So, we are developing a product for smart cities and smart villages. We are developing an operating system through which we can transform the ways communities operate.”“GIS is all about temporal data. Temporal data means data with time of past, present and future. If we have the data of past and present then we can give better prediction of future events. For example, we get traffic data on Google Maps. ‘Live’ traffic data is derived from past data and present road conditions, and future predictions are made by combining these two. We want to create temporal data for India which the government agencies can use it for analytics and decision-making processes. The government can balance its resources according to the demand-supply from the citizen’s side. Some applications for example would be road condition mapping, vaccination progress monitoring, development of educational and healthcare facilities,” he explains.Incubated at Bhau Institute, COEPThe Bhau Institute at College of Engineering Pune (COEP) in 2019 had invited applications for startups working in the deep-tech sector. Rathod applied and got selected. Vijay Talele is Rathod’s team mentor and helps them keep on one page and in sync with the market reality. Iowaaska also got selected in the top five startups representing India in Munich, Germany, in 2019 at an event conducted by the German Indian Business Forum. Product and revenue model Says Rathod,” Our product is the ‘Intelligent Map (I-Map) which is in the development stage. It will host, monitor evaluate the Geo-Informatics Science (GIS) data for various decision-making processes. We will be certifying the product with basic ISO/ICE standards, Make in India and Atma Nirbhar Bharat. We are looking for investment of USD 1 million against equity for further product development stages.”“Revenue generation is based on subscription-based Software as a Service model with Intelligent Map as the product. Monitoring and evaluation of the entire administration and operation of the community in these private and government smart cities will be done with the help of our services. The evaluation monitoring data generated of the smart cities will be beneficial for corporates and CSR activities to understand how the city is transforming. Suppose we have a problem related to pollution, government schemes or health issues, the intelligent map will help solve the issue fast. Data needs to be collected for this. This data will be the satellite imagery, drone and field survey data and statistical data. Based on this data and an algorithm, we will be able to analyse and predict future events,” Rathod explains.Mentor speak“Iowaaska is focussing on providing services for smart villages and smart cities projects using GIS technology. It will be useful and has huge potential looking at the way villages and cities have started utilising such data to control and manage their areas better and provide services to the citizens. It also can be used by industries which are looking for geographically mapped roads, underground-utility-service pipelines, to aid their decision-making process. They are working with the Zilla Parishad and working to develop the product for five villages. Bhau Institute is also helping team Iowaaska to raise funds.”-Vijay Talele, CEO, Bhau Institute, COEP||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/startup-mantra-enabling-a-smart-reading-of-map-data-101617455109681.html

03-04-2021||Kolkata||West Bengal polls: BJP, TMC engage in battle of nerves||The ruling Trinamool Congress in West Bengal and its arch-rival the Bharatiya Janata Party engaged in a battle of nerves even as the first two phases of the assembly elections have already been held with six more rounds remaining. Reports of political clashes between the two parties continued to pour in from across the state ahead of the third phase polls scheduled on Tuesday when 31 constituencies are slated to go into elections. While Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah claimed during public rallies on Thursday and Friday that TMC supremo Mamata Banerjee was sure to lose in Nandigram and the TMC would be defeated this time, the latter hit back on Saturday. Former BJP veteran Yashwant Sinha, who recently joined the TMC, said in a press conference at the Trinamool Congress headquarters in Kolkata that late on Friday night Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Union home minister Amit Shah and BJP president JP Nadda held a meeting in Delhi to discuss the ongoing polls in Bengal. “It was an internal meeting and there was a frank exchange of views. The BJP troika has concluded that the party’s performance in the first two phases would be very disappointing. They know that their performance in the remaining six phases would be all the more disappointing, as they were pinning their hopes on the first two phases,” said Sinha. Earlier on Thursday, while polls were being held in 30 constituencies, including Nandigram in East Midnapore, Modi said in a public rally that there were rumours about Banerjee planning to contest from a second seat as defeat was imminent in Nandigram. Also read: Mamata’s “obstructionist mindset” deprived Bengal of jobs, industries - PM Modi“With every phase of polls, Didi’s nervousness will increase. On the cricket field, if a player repeatedly questions the umpire, it means that the player is at fault. In elections, if someone blames the EVM and the ECI, it means the game is over. Didi, defeat is in front of you. Accept it,” Modi said on Saturday while addressing a rally in Hooghly. “I have heard, not verified, that brainstorming is going on within the TMC. Some of the wise children who are still left in the TMC were discussing that Didi’s hasty decision to contest from Nandigram proved to be a blunder. I have been told that sensing defeat in Nandigram, some people had decided that Mamata should contest from another seat. But some wise men told didi that it would be her second blunder. Some people told her that if she loses from two seats in Bengal then TMC’s political future would be at stake,” said Modi while addressing a rally in south Bengal. On Friday, Shah had said that it was clear from the first two phases that the BJP would win more than 50 seats out of the 60 constituencies and didi was losing from Nandigram. Banerjee and top TMC leaders were quick to refute the claims with Banerjee herself saying that she was confident of her win from Nandigram and that Modi shouldn’t advise her as she was not a BJP member. Countering the BJP’s claims, a TMC tweet on Thursday triggered speculation over whether the West Bengal chief minister would contest against Modi from Varanasi or the party would field someone to challenge him in the 2024 Lok Sabha polls. “Didi is winning Nandigram. The question of her fighting from another seat doesn’t arise. @narendramodi Ji, retract from your efforts to mislead people before they see your lies with the end of nomination in WB [West Bengal]. Look for a safer seat in 2024, as you will be challenged in Varanasi,” the TMC tweeted. “It was Banerjee who challenged the BJP by announcing that she would contest from Nandigram. Now that the TMC is certain that they are going to lose they are putting up a bold phase to boost the morale of the workers. But the trend is clear and people of Bengal know who would win the battle,” said Samik Bhattacharya, BJP spokesperson. At Katwa in Burdwan district, TMC workers even went to the extent of distributing sweets among themselves on Friday, claiming that the battle has already been won. “Such psychological wars are common during the polls and have also been seen in the 2019 elections. While this is used to boost the morale of workers, it also has some effect on the swing voters,” said Biswanath Chakraborty, a professor of political science at Rabindra Bharati University. While the two parties were fighting a war of words, clashes among the party workers continued across the state. BJP candidate Motibur Rahaman from Harishchandrapur in north Bengal’s Malda district was allegedly heckled by TMC workers on Friday night. Both parties have lodged complaints against each other with the local police. Earlier in the day, BJP’s candidate Dipak Halder at Diamond Harbour in South 24 Parganas was allegedly thrashed by TMC workers. The ruling party, however, rubbished the allegations. Clashes also broke out at Bhangar in South 24 Parganas and Krishnanagar in Nadia. At Barjora on Bankura clashes broke out between the BJP and the TMC on Friday night leaving at least two injured. At Sabang in West Midnapore, a former TMC supporter’s wife was allegedly heckled on Saturday. While the TMC alleged she was thrashed by BJP workers, and had to be rushed to the hospital, the latter rubbished TMC’s allegations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/west-bengal-polls-bjp-tmc-engage-in-battle-of-nerves-101617453188071.html
03-04-2021||Chandigarh||UK strain behind surge in Punjab’s Covid cases||The high presence of the UK strain of Covid-19 has led to a steep rise in active cases in Punjab with the state already registering a bigger surge in cases this time as compared to the first wave last year. Though the state health department is still not sure if the strain, which spreads 70% faster, made its way to Punjab through travellers from the United Kingdom, the government is considering its high prevalence as the prime reason for the spike. 80% of samples of Covid positive people sent for genome sequencing to the Pune laboratory in March were found having the UK strain. The strain was found in 10 of the 22 districts of Punjab with a maximum of 106 samples belonging to Mohali district. This was followed by Amritsar (94), Shaheed Bhagat Singh Nagar (56), Faridkot (18) and Patiala (15). Also read: Punjab saw 12-fold hike in active Covid cases in 2 months, higher than MahaHow the UK strain bumped up cases “During our meetings with the Government of India as well, we haven’t heard much about the high presence of the UK strain in other states as is there in Punjab. So obviously the strain can be termed as the main reason behind the faster surge,” state principal secretary, health and family welfare, Hussan Lal said. According to the Union health ministry data released on Saturday, Covid-19 cases increased 12-fold in Punjab between February 3 and April 3 at a rate that surpasses Maharashtra’s nine-fold case growth rate during the period. The faster rate of infection due to this strain can be judged from the fact that in the past one week, the state has added more than 20,000 new cases. When the state had hit the peak in September last year, the maximum single-day hike was of 2,896 infections on September 17. With experts predicting the second wave peak in the third week of April, the state has already broken last year’s records by registering a single-day hike of 3,176 cases on March 26. In the past week, the state’s ratio of active cases reached 10%, which is the highest ever of the first and the current wave. In September, Punjab saw a single-day spike of more than 2,000 cases a day on nine occasions, in this wave, between March 15 to April 3, the state has seen more than 2,000 cases for 12 occasions. SBS Nagar, where the maximum cases of the UK strain were detected, has at present the highest number of active cases of 3,414 in Punjab, followed by 3,297 in Amritsar, which is at the second spot in terms of the presence of the UK strain. NRI belt bears the brunt, more samples sent Punjab nodal officer for Covid-19 Dr Rajesh Bhaskar said that inappropriate Covid behaviour along with the UK strain of the virus is the second major reason behind the surge in cases. “You will notice that in Jalandhar, where less presence of the UK strain was found, cases are very high. The same is the case with Patiala and Hoshiarpur. To understand this better, we are sending 400 more Covid samples for genome sequencing,” Dr Bhaskar said. The Doaba belt, comprising the four districts of Jalandhar, SBS Nagar, Hoshiarpur and Kapurthala, account for 25% of Punjab’s Covid cases in the second wave. Jalandhar civil surgeon Dr Balwant Singh said the UK strain is the biggest reason behind the surge and has mainly hit Phillaur and Nurmahal towns that reported a high number of cases and have now been turned into containment zones. Similarly, Hoshiarpur, where 31 cases of the UK strain were detected, has seen a sharp increase in Covid deaths with nearly 100 fatalities in the past two weeks. Procedures flouted by visitors could be cause The state authorities are not sure how the UK strain reached Punjab and if the non-resident Indians (NRIs) brought it to Doaba, the winter hub of foreign visitors with almost every family having relatives abroad. The state’s principal secretary, health, says the department has been tracking NRIs and foreign travellers. Apart from allowing their boarding only after the RT-PCR test, the travellers undergo the test again on arrival, he said. Before international flights from the UK were suspended by India in February due to the strain, Punjab had eight UK returnees tested for the strain, but it was not found in any case. The samples that tested positive for the UK strain were randomly taken from containment zones where a high number of Covid-19 cases surfaced. The head of Punjab’s expert group on Covid-19, Dr KK Talwar, said since the strain has originated from the UK, it could have come from foreign shores only. “Someone must have brought it from outside. We follow set procedures to quarantine foreign travellers but the way people flout the procedures can be the reason behind the presence of the strain,” Dr Talwar said. No data on number of positive travellers The health department does not have the exact data of foreign visitors that landed in Punjab over the past three months. “Even as all districts have been asked to provide the data about NRIs and foreign travellers, half of them have not reported it yet,” a senior official said, requesting anonymity. In view of the surge in the mutant variants of Covid in Punjab, the Centre had directed the Sri Guru Ram Dass Jee International Airport, Amritsar, authorities in February to conduct the RT-PCR test on each and every passenger arriving from Europe, especially from the UK and West Asia. According to the airport authorities, 22,561 passengers from such countries were tested for Covid-19 from February 23 to April 2. How many of them were found positive is not known.

03-04-2021||Bangalore||Karnataka: KS Eshwarappa says there is no question of CM Yediyurappa resigning||There is no question of B S Yediyurappa resigning as the Chief Minister of Karnataka, senior Minister K S Eshwarappa said on Saturday, as he termed his letter to the Governor as an administrative matter.He said Congress leader Siddaramaiah was demanding Yediyurappa's resignation, under the illusion of becoming the CM.Following Eshwarappa's recent complaint to the Governor against Yediyurappa, alleging direct interference in the affairs of his department, Siddaramaiah, who is the leader of opposition in the state assembly, has demanded that the Chief Minister step down from his post.He had also urged the Governor to intervene and recommend for the President's rule in the state."Siddaramaiah is in an urgency to become the Chief Minister. People have rejected him, he was defeated in Chamundeshwari (constituency in 2018), he lost the Chief Minister post.He is now under the illusion that if Yediyurappa resigns, he will become the Chief Minister," Eshwarappa said.Speaking to reporters, he said there is no question of Yediyurappa resigning and Siddaramaiah should not be under the illusion of becoming the Chief Minister.The former Chief Minister is unable to digest our organisational strength, also he doesn't have anything to criticise Modi-led government at the Centre or the government here with as both are doing a good job, he said."That's the reason he (Siddaramaiah) is latching on the letter to Governor and is demanding for CM's resignation.Eshwarappa, who is Rural Development Minister in Yediyurappa's cabinet on Wednesday had complained to the Governor against the Chief Minister alleging direct interference in the affairs of his department.He had met Governor Vajubhai Vala and submitted a five- page letter on serious lapses and authoritarian way of running the administration by the Chief Minister, in which he pointed at three instances where Yediyurappa sanctioned funds without taking him into confidence.Commenting on his meeting the Governor and submitting a letter, Eshwarappa said, minor administrational differences were there and efforts are on to rectify them, nothing else.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/karnataka-ks-eshwarappa-says-there-is-no-question-of-cm-yediyurappa-resigning-101617449975110.html

A decision regarding students of class 9th and 11th will soon be taken,” the education minister wrote on Twitter.Varsha Gaikwad’s announcement comes a day after Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray said that stricter rules will be imposed in the state over the weekend following a massive increase in daily cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). As the cases surpassed 47,800 on Friday, Thackeray warned that a complete lockdown cannot be ruled out if no alternative solution is found over the weekend and if citizens fail to follow Covid-19 appropriate behavior.“We will issue guidelines for stricter curbs in the next couple of days. The decision on the lockdown will be taken after talking to political leaders and experts from various fields in two days. Political parties and industrialists have been opposing the lockdown and warning government against it. We are in a catch-22. If a lockdown is imposed, we face economic crisis. At the same time, lives are more important to us. Many countries, including France, United Kingdom, Belgium and Brazil, have imposed a strict lockdown for many weeks in their fight against the second wave,” Thackeray said in his address to the people of Maharashtra.Several Maharashtra districts including Palghar and Pune have ordered a temporary closure of schools.Maharashtra is among the 11 states designated by the Centre as ‘states of grave concern’ as it has recorded a nine-fold increase in cases and described the situation in the state as ‘particularly worrying.’ On February 3, there were 42,830 active Covid-19 cases in the western state and they shot up to 3,91,203 on April 3, according to figures released by the Union ministry of health and family welfare.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/class-1-to-8-students-in-maharashtra-to-be-promoted-without-exams-due-to-covid-19-pandemic-101617450022115.html

But the special NIA court granted only four days' extension.Mansukh Hiran, the man who claimed ownership of the explosives-laden vehicle outside billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s residence on February 25, was found dead in a creek in early March. NIA, which is probing the death case as well as the bomb scare case, arrested Sachin Vaze after he was named by Hiran’s wife. Also, according to people cited by the NIA, the gelatin sticks found in the vehicle near Ambani's house were procured by the suspended police officer.According to NIA’s initial findings, Hiran was smothered to death before being thrown into Thane Creek, which is consistent with the findings of the Maharashtra Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) which was initially investigating the murder, people familiar with the development told HT.“Several handkerchiefs had been stuffed in Hiran’s mouth and it appears his face had been covered ‘tightly’ with another big cloth, due to which he could not breathe. There was some struggle but he seems to have been overpowered,” an official said earlier.Sachin Vaze was taken to the Mithi river near Bandra-Kurla Complex by the federal agency last Sunday, from where they recovered two CPUs of computers, the number plate of a vehicle, two DVRs, and a laptop among other things.The NIA has also questioned the suspended Mumbai police officer’s former colleagues, including crime branch officer Prakash Ovhal, who reportedly purchased a Mitsubishi Outlander from Vaze.Sachin was arrested by the NIA on March 13 for his purported role in abandoning a Mahindra Scorpio with 20 loose gelatin sticks and a threat note near industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s residence in Mumbai.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/sachin-vaze-held-in-ambani-security-case-to-remain-in-nia-custody-till-april-7-101617447312191.html
03-04-2021||Bangalore||Karnataka health minister says no relaxation in new Covid-19 guidelines||Hinting at no relaxation in the new set of guidelines issued by the state government, amid pressure from various sectors, Karnataka Health Minister K Sudhakar on Saturday said it was inevitable to take certain strict measures so that things don't go out of control.He said the guidelines have been issued on the advice of the technical advisory committee consisting of experts, after examining the situation, and if things are under control by April 20, activities will be allowed to resume."The government is not happy by restricting activities.I have been requesting through the media for the last one month that a second wave is at our doorstep and if we don't understand and take precautionary measures, the government will have no other options and may have to take serious measures," Sudhakar said.Speaking to reporters here, he said Karnataka was the first state to resume all the business activities, but the state is today reporting about 5,000 cases per day and 3,500 of them are from Bengaluru alone."The technical advisory committee has said this will be there for another two months, till the May end and the graph will start declining from June first week.If we don't take measures and something untoward happens, won't it be the government's responsibility?" he asked.Aimed at curbing Covid-19 with the spike in cases, the government on Friday in a new set of guidelines had ordered the closure of gyms and swimming pools while capping the seating capacity in theatres at 50 per cent in certain districts.It has also ordered apartment complexes to shut common facilities such as party halls and clubhouses.The new restrictions imposed by the government through the guidelines will be in force till April 20.Noting that the government has issued guidelines after getting several reports from the technical advisory committee, and after consulting senior officials and ministers, Sudhakar said it was not done at one go."People from several sectors are saying their activities should not be restricted and should go on freely. Yes, we (govt) too understand, but things should not go out of our control, so it was inevitable for the government to take certain strict measures.We request for cooperation from everyone," he said.The Karnataka Film Chamber of Commerce has decided to meet Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa to bring to his notice about the impact of capping the seating capacity in theatres at 50 per cent, on the industry, and is likely to seek relaxation so that it doesn't impact films that have just been released.Also, gym owners have demanded the government to reconsider the decision or allow them to operate with 50 per cent capacity or announce a package so that they can make payment for staff and use it for maintenance.There is pressure from some private schools to allow them to function, similar is the demand from gym, swimming pool and club owners, also people want to hold marriages with large gatherings, the Minister said."These measures are not permanent, let's follow these temporary measures for some days... I'm not saying it (Covid- 19 spread) can be controlled 100 percent by these measures, but we can try to bring things under control," he said.Responding to a question, the Minister said there are guidelines for elections, and religious places too, there is no concession for any sector or activities."The government is only trying to control this pandemic that's all, there is no politics or any malicious intent behind this," he said, as he evaded questions on night curfew or weekend lockdown stating that he doesn't want to speak on what measures will be taken in the future.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/karnataka-health-minister-says-no-relaxation-in-new-covid-19-guidelines-101617445283478.html

03-04-2021||Noida||Learning pet etiquette a must to avoid conflict with co-residents in societies||Discord between pet owners and their fellow residents is a recurring issue in Noida, often spoiling neighbourly goodwill. It is often triggered over minor episodes such as a pet scaring a neighbour or late-night barking by a pet dog disturbing neighbour’s sleep or even over an overturned or broken flowerpot.For any pet-parent, their pet is no less than a child, but for others, it is an animal, often a source of inconvenience to others.According to the Animal Welfare Board of India guidelines: “A pet is akin to a perennial toddler and therefore deserves the same attention throughout its life as is reserved for a human toddler during infancy”. It is therefore important to understand the pet etiquettes that must be followed for their smooth parenting.“Whenever someone adopts a dog from us, we ensure that we tell them all the dos and don’ts of raising a pet. No one will tolerate it if you take your dog out and let them poop wherever they want and then don’t clean after. Such issues can then escalate within the community,” says Kaveri Rana from People for Animals, Gautam Buddh Nagar chapter.Srishti Sharma, a certified dog trainer from Delhi, conducts pet etiquette sessions daily.“A pet is only as good as its parents. So, both require training. I organise various workshops and online courses where the owners are taught how to handle their dogs under different situations and their various responsibilities towards their pet and the society so that all can co-exist,” says Srishti.Pet parents agree that following certain etiquettes not only help them keep the pet’s behaviour in check, but also help them live in harmony with others.“I took up the classes because I want to be able to understand my pet and its body language in order for it to feel safe and calm when in public. No pet parent wants their pet to be a nuisance to others. All of us want to be able to coexist in the same environment,” says Gyandeep Chaudhary, a resident of Gaur Saundaryam in Greater Noida West, who has two dogs. “Before my classes with Srishti, I was not aware that many of my actions, which I thought were right, were actually training my dog to be more aggressive. For instance, when he would bark at someone, we would comfort him to stop but after training we got to know that we were actually encouraging him to bark at strangers by patting him.”Anubha Majethia, who has a pet Basset Hound named Elvis, says learning her pet’s body language has helped her keep trouble at bay.“There are some particular body language characteristics that can tell us what the pet is feeling. For instance, often when I take Elvis for a walk, some kids want to pet him. But instead of letting the kids have their way, I first check how my pet is feeling. If his tail is between his legs and he shows his teeth or growls, it means he is not comfortable and I ask the kids to step aside. On the other hand, if Elvis is wagging his tail and wants to just sniff the other person, I let him do that because I understand that he is comfortable and wouldn’t harm anyone,” says Anubha, a resident of Great Value Sharnam apartments in Sector 107, Noida.Noida Sector 48 resident Rita Arya, who has a Pug Simba, recalls how one of her neighbours – also a pet owner- was not aware of the ‘scoop after your pet poops’ rule.“It was embarrassing to see that RWA was blaming all pet owners living in the area for mess created by one person who wasn’t aware of a simple pet etiquette. I took it upon myself to teach the person that it is our responsibility to clean up after our pets relieve themselves in public. The pet owner was quick to learn and there were no complaints thereafter,” she says.Another Noida resident Neelam Aggarwal who has a Labrador named Tutu adds that pet owners take every precaution to ensure their pet does not create a problem for others.“A key issue that comes up with pets is that the people around get scared by the pet walking around and react which often ticks off the poor dog. As a rule, I ensure my dog is always on leash and if someone is passing by, I keep Tutu several metres away. We also pick up poop and throw into a designated dustbin in a well-packed manner,” she says.Resident welfare association (RWA) members also feel that if pet owners follow the simple etiquettes, there will not be much left for others to complain about.“The major issue is that many owners still do not know about the rule of scooping after their pet is done. However, gradually such complaints have gone down as pet owners have become aware of their responsibilities. Hygiene is very important whether you are a pet owner or not. Even if they go outside, they should always scoop after their pet,” says Rajiva Singh, President, Noida Federation of Apartment Owners’ Association.A set of pet etiquettes as per experts and trained professionals:1. Always make sure to walk your dog on leash in public places, no matter how well-trained your dog is. Do not let them loose with other dogs they haven’t met before. Just because your dog is friendly, doesn’t mean other dogs will be.2. Always make sure to pick up your dog’s poop. This is another major reason why many societies do not allow dogs in the park, making it difficult for pet owners to exercise them.3. Teach your dog loose leash walking. Any person who is not confident with dogs will easily get uncomfortable around one, who is constantly pulling and lunging at people passing by.4. Teach obedience. Ensure that you start working on your dog’s obedience as soon you get them home, which includes both indoor and outdoor training.5. Timely vaccinations and regular grooming to ensure the well-being of your pet.6. Regular exposure to different places and working on your pet’s obedience in each new location helps boost their confidence ensuring a well-behaved and balanced dog.7. Take help from a professional for any issue regarding your pet which you are unable to deal with. It is always best to start early as soon you sense a new or bad behavior/habit.What the Animal Welfare Board says on guidelines for pet owners:1. No amount of pressure should lead to abandonment of a pet animal. Doing so is a violation of law.2. Barking is a natural form of expression of a dog and has to be tolerated in a society. However, incessant barking can disturb neighbours. Hence, pet owners are advised to make every effort to keep their dogs quiet, particularly during night hours.3. Pet owners are advised to ensure that their pets are healthy and clean. Their vaccinations should be up to date. Sterilization is advised as India has excessive dog population.4. Pet owners are advised to either clean up when the pet defecates in public premises or participate in other solutions to maintain cleanliness. Pet owners are advised to take the initiative to discuss with their RWAs, ways and means to dispose pet excreta.5. Leashing of pets in public places is advisable. It assures passersby that they are safe and makes them feel more comfortable when walking in the vicinity of an owner with his pet or dog on a leash. Leashing also ensures the safety of the pet from being run over by vehicles on streets, or worse still, being the cause of accidents.6. Whereas you cannot be debarred by RWAs from the use of lifts or elevators for your dogs, you are advised not to object to the use of ‘alternate’ lifts if there is more than one working lift or elevator in a building which is conveniently accessible.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/learning-pet-etiquette-a-must-to-avoid-conflict-with-co-residents-in-societies-101617446168033.html

The UP Police on Thursday night registered an FIR in Barabanki district against the owner of a private hospital in Mau after documents of an Uttar Pradesh registration bullet-proof luxury ambulance, which was used to take Ansari from Ropar jail to a Mohali court on Wednesday, were found to be fake. On March 26, the Supreme Court ordered shifting him to Banda prison within a fortnight. The court ruling came as a victory for the Uttar Pradesh government, which made marathon efforts to get him back so that he can be tried for the criminal cases against him.

The KPCC Chief said if Eshwarappa had written about his lack of confidence in the CM to the party leadership, it can be considered as their internal matter. But he has written to the constitutional head of the state. Shivakumar alleged that the administration has collapsed in the state. The guidelines issued to check the spread of Covid-19 in the state defies logic and is not practical, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/congs-dk-shivakumar-says-cm-yediyurappa-should-sack-minister-ks-eshwarappa-101617440102848.html

Kumar was replying to queries from journalists about the death of at least eight persons in the days following Holi festivities. Family members of many of the deceased have alleged that the deaths had occurred following consumption of spurious liquor, triggering a furore since Bihar has been a dry state for the past five years. Officials, while confirming the deaths, have remained tight-lipped over the probable cause. Opposition has also trained its guns at the administration, questioning the governments enforcement of prohibition. "A special team of officials has been sent there with instructions to look into each and every aspect. Based upon their inputs, adequate action will be taken", Kumar said. He spoke after flagging off a bus carrying 21 children, along with their guardians, to Ahmedabad for treatment of congenital heart diseases. The children were aged between four months and 11 years and the cost of their treatment, including travel expenses was being borne by the state government, Kumar said. The endeavour was a part of "Bal Hridaya Yojana", that seeks to screen children for heart diseases so that treatment could take place early. The scheme falls under "sabke liye atirikt swasthya suvidha" (better health facilities to all) a component of Saat Nishchay 2 (seven resolves second part) that outline the governments agenda in the current term. The first part of seven resolves was unrolled in 2015, when Kumar, now in his fourth term as Chief Minister, had got re-elected for the third consecutive tenure.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-cm-nitish-kumar-sends-officials-to-nawada-to-probe-alleged-hooch-tragedy-101617439355112.html
03-04-2021||Kolkata||West Bengal polls: 'Catch us if you can', says Derek O'Brien to BJP||"Catch us if you can," said Trinamool Congress (TMC) leader Derek O'Brien on Saturday responding to BJP President JP Nadda's claim that Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee-led TMC is losing the assembly elections in West Bengal.Addressing the media, the TMC leader said "Mo-Shah" (Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Minister Amit Shah) are aware of the 'grim' situation of the party in the state after the first two phases of polling, and that is why they are playing 'mind games'."I am amused by the mind game of Mo-Shah. Overall in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, Trinamool had 3 per cent advantage in spite of all the big talks from the tourist gang. Trinamool has substantially built on that lead in 2021, so catch us if you can," he said."My sources in Delhi told me that Mo-Shah plus the BJP president have reviewed the situation in Bengal, and know that situation is grim after phase one and two. That is why they are using this mind game strategy. Though it won't work," O'Brien added.He added that TMC has gained 6 per cent advantage over other parties in the ongoing polls in the state.On BJP's claim of Mamata Banerjee looking for another constituency to contest as she might lose from Nandigram, O'Brien said, "We have won Nandigram. There is no other constituency and it's all BJP's mind games."Earlier today, BJP President JP Nadda claimed that people from TMC had told him that Mamata Banerjee is looking for another seat to contest as she is going to lose against former ally Suvendu Adhikari in Nandigram. He also extruded confidence that BJP would win the assembly polls in West Bengal.

Was the permission of the University of Delhi and the State Government taken for organising such a trip in pandemic times?,” asked the letter.In response, college principal John K Varghese confirmed that the dean of residence and the security in-charge of the college, who accompanied the students on the trip, had also tested positive. The principal said the trip was organised after parents’ consent. “Please be informed that the Dean’s Office is aware of the situation and necessary steps have already been taken in consultation with medical and civic authorities,” he said.A college staff requesting anonymity said around two dozen hostel students returned from the trip to Dalhousie, organised by the college, on March 31 and were tested after developing symptoms.The development came on the day when the national capital reported over 3,500 fresh cases of Covid-19 and 14 deaths with a daily positivity rate of 4.11%. The Delhi government has said that the fourth wave of the infection is underway in the national Capital but chief minister Arvind Kejriwal has ruled out imposing lockdown in the capital, however, experts feel regions such as Delhi, which are witnessing a rapid surge in cases, need to impose restrictions before it is too late.The college, earlier on Friday, announced that thirteen hostellers had tested positive, following which the dean’s office had put in place “necessary and stringent measures to ensure isolation and social distancing for all residents with the usual Covid protocols.”The college said its “inner perimeter” will be kept out of bounds for everyone on the campus “unless specific clearance was given by the principal.” The outer perimeter may be accessed “by those with relevant and regular work after due process at the security counter.”“Faculty who are scheduled to come to college may defer their coming till a notification informs them of an improvement in the situation. There is no reason for panic and please await further information on the situation…” Principal Varghese said in the notice.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/13-stephen-s-students-turn-covid-19-positive-stringent-restrictions-on-campus-101617419406669.html

03-04-2021||Chandigarh||Interview: Illegal intrusions in state not acceptable, says Anil Vij||Firebrand Haryana home minister Anil Vij whose frequent run-ins with chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar often make headlines, on Friday said there are occasions when they have differences of opinion, but it is the view of the chief minister which would always prevail. Vij on Friday spoke to Executive Editor Ramesh Vinayak and Assistant Editor Hitender Rao on a range of issues including his relationship with deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala, the need for an anti-conversion law, sloppy police investigations, transfer of investigations from one district to another and farmers’ agitation. Excerpts: You are among the handful of politicians who have independently held the home portfolio in Haryana? How challenging has been this assignment? The home department has generally remained with the chief minister. Officials initially found it difficult to report to a home minister instead of the chief minister. There are many challenges, such as controlling organised crime, checking the proliferation of narcotics, improving the working condition of cops. Which one needs top priority?People should get quick relief. What I have found is that pendency has increased in many districts as the police failed to work out cases of crime. If this happens, public lose confidence in the system. The day people stop queuing up outside my house with complaints, I will acknowledge that police is performing. District police chiefs need to move out of offices and visit at least one police station a week. But why is the crime investigation rate unsatisfactory? Sloppiness and lack of follow-up are two major reasons. Cops should be held accountable for cases which are pending for years. People suffer due to slackness. The image of the police also needs a makeover. It needs to be people-friendly and improve public confidence. How do you view the increase in the incidence of crime against women in the last few years? This can be due to lack of a deterrent effect and also due to the patriarchal mindset in the state. You keep on having run-ins with the chief minister. And these things become public. Does the party high command approve such episodes in public?We do have difference of opinion at times on some issues. It happens at times. I am entitled to my views and always like to articulate my views. I have a good relationship with the chief minister. We are on good talking terms. But you often end up being overruled by the CM. Do you seek the intervention of party high command?The view of the chief minister would always prevail. I do apprise the party high command of my viewpoint or difference of opinion. Why there is a need to have an anti-conversion law in Haryana? Does it not infringe upon liberty and privacy of individuals?I know about cases where religious conversions were either attempted or took place forcibly, fraudulently or using allurement. We strongly feel there is a need for such a law. Nikita Tomar case is a case in point. The proposed law has a provision for sanctioning of consensual inter-faith marriages. What effect will the 75% private sector job quota have on the industry in the state? The RSS is opposed to this idea. Being a part of the cabinet, I would not like to comment on this. I was a part of the decision to roll out this law. The RSS is an independent body and entitled to its views. It’s not necessary for the Sangh to approve or support our actions. Why were you seeking the ouster of the incumbent DGP? Are there any differences?There are no differences. The DGP was appointed for two years. Once the term gets completed it was my duty to start the process for appointment of the new DGP. I only did that. But he was already granted an extension of tenure much before his two-year term ended?That extension was given by the state government till a new arrangement is made. A proposal containing names of officers eligible for appointment as the DGP has been sent to the chief minister. But the CM is not in favour of replacing the DGP?Well, he is the chief minister,and he may have a view on this. I would not like to comment on whether the DGP should be given extension or not. It is often alleged that a group of IPS officers influence your decision making? No one can influence me. I make my own decisions. What’s your stand regarding the Rohingya Muslim migrants in Haryana? You recently said India is not a dharamshala. Our information is that there are about 1,500 Rohingya Muslim migrants putting up in Nuh. Some Delhi-based NGOs are supporting them financially and help them inhabit. These NGOs get them asylee certification from the UN. So, there is a bigger gameplan at work, and we are in the process of identifying them and check their plans. Does this not smack of BJP’s Hindutva, anti-minority agenda? It’s not. Rather it is a nationalistic agenda. The district SP has been asked to submit a report to me after studying each case of Rohingya Muslim migrant. How well has the law on cow slaughter worked for the state government? There has been a drastic reduction in cases of cow slaughter. The law has proved to be effective. How’s your relationship with the deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala. It is said that you are out to fix him — be it the liquor smuggling during lockdown or the hooch deaths. I have a very good equation with Dushyant and his father Ajay Singh. It’s not right to say that I have gone after him. If hooch deaths have taken place, they need to be investigated. Whatever comes out in an investigation has to be dealt with. I have nothing against anyone. The SIT probing the liquor smuggling had blamed both the police department as well as the excise. How do you view the threat to ruling coalition MLAs by protesting farmers? Even INLD leader Abhay Chautala made a provocative statement recently.Everyone has a right to protest but not to infringe upon the liberty of others. Others are also entitled to their viewpoint. It’s an agitation, not a brawl. Abhay Singh’s remarks are unfortunate. We have arrested a farmer leader who made a similar statement. With farmers laying siege to the national capital, do you foresee a potential law and order fallout?It should not happen. We have been telling farmer leaders also that it should remain an agitation and not a law and order problem. You have been ordering transfer of criminal investigations from one district to another. Is there a law to back your actions?Often the complainant is not satisfied with the investigations in a case. Thus, we get the investigation transferred. There is no legal hitch in doing this. The high court recently decried the move of state governments in ordering parallel investigations by setting up SITs and the state government does this frequently. How would you justify this? That’s not a parallel investigation. The case actually gets transferred to the special investigation team (SIT). For instance, the hooch tragedy was investigated by the police initially. But once the SIT was formed, all the cases were transferred to the SIT. What role has the police played in the pandemic?The police have the power to challan people who do not wear a mask. As per the latest data, the police have earned a revenue of about ₹50 crore by challaning mask violators.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/interview-illegal-intrusions-in-state-not-acceptable-says-anil-vij-101617395465235.html
03-04-2021||Delhi||4th wave in Delhi, says CM Kejriwal, but holds off on Covid-19 curbs||Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Friday admitted that the fourth wave of the Covid-19 pandemic was raging in the Capital, but did not impose a lockdown or any curbs to control the spike on a day the city reported 3,594 cases, an alarming jump of about 30% over the previous day’s infection tally.Experts said Delhi’s strategy could fall well short of an effective mechanism to stop the pandemic, even as several other parts of the country considered stringent curbs to contain the fresh wave; Pune shut eateries, bars and restaurants for seven days in view of the spike. Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray said the state may face a shortage in health care infrastructure if the “alarming situation” continued, adding that stricter curbs will be imposed in a day or two.Experts have consistently recommended against a lockdown, but believe that regions seeing a surge in cases, such as Delhi, need to impose restrictions before it is too late, even as they try to accelerate vaccinations. Both, they stress, are important.Fresh waves in several parts of the India and the world have been worse than the previous surges, with mutating variants of the virus proving to be a bigger threat than the initial ballooning of the pandemic.“For the rest of the country, one may call it the second wave. But for Delhi, this is the fourth wave. We are heading towards the fourth peak. This wave is witnessing exponential increase in cases and spreading very fast. It is concerning but there is nothing to panic because this wave is also less severe in terms of number of deaths and cases that require hospitalisation, admission to ICU, etc,” Kejriwal said at a digital news briefing. The Delhi CM’s remarks came after he chaired an emergency meeting with health minister Satyendar Jain and senior officials in the health department.He also asked the Centre to remove the eligibility criteria for vaccines (currently those over the age of 45), opening up the inoculation drive to everyone.Delhi reported its first wave in June, the second in September and the third in November, which has been the worst so far, with the highest case tally of 8,593.On Friday, there were 89,030 new infections reported across India, the highest single-day increase since September 19. India’s highest single-day caseload was 99,181 on September 1, according to the HT Covid-19 dashboard.The Delhi chief minister said that while there was no plan for immediate curbs, people will be consulted if such a move was considered in the future.“Around October last year, when Delhi was recording 3,000-4,000 new cases each day, ICU admissions were around 1,700 – against that, around 800 people are in the ICU currently. Similarly, we were recording around 40 deaths per day then. Currently, we are recording around 10-12 deaths a day. This wave is evidently less severe compared to the old ones and the home isolation model is working well,” Kejriwal said.India is in the grip of a second wave, and case and death numbers are certain to rise through April in what is going to be a race between the virus and the vaccine. India’s vaccine drive has seen a slow start, relative to the size of the country and the number of people that need to be vaccinated.Kejriwal appealed to the people to wear face masks, maintain social distancing and regularly wash hands to prevent getting infected.The chief minister said efforts were being made to ramp up the health care infrastructure to stop the surge. If the Centre allowed vaccination at non-health care facilities such as schools, immunisation can be taken up on a war footing to check the spread of the virus, he added.“I appreciate the Centre’s decision to operationalise both public and private sector Covid-19 vaccination centres (CVCs) on all days of the month of April. However, I urge the government to remove the clause of vaccinating only those people aged above 45 years. I request the Centre to start the vaccination drive at a mass-scale,” the CM said.He also appealed to the government to allow the vaccination drive to be conducted in schools and community centres so that a larger number of people can be reached out.A little over a month ago, Delhi reported 94 cases on February 16. The positivity rate that day was 0.17%. On Friday, it was 4.11%.“At the current juncture, there is no plan to impose any lockdown. We are monitoring the situation. In the future, if needed, we will talk to people and only then take decisions. For ambulances, hospital beds, ICU beds and ventilators, we have made a detailed plan in a phased manner. It will guide us on when to increase beds in government hospitals, when in private hospitals, etc,” said the Kejriwal.“At this juncture, we have three broad objectives. How to arrest the spread of the disease at the earliest; we will aggressively follow the test, tracing, isolation strategy and scale up containment efforts.However, the biggest role is that of the people of Delhi. We have fought three earlier waves. We can do it again. I appeal to people to wear masks, adhere to social distancing and wash hands regularly. These are our biggest protection. The second objective is hospital management, for which we have chalked out a detailed plan today.”He added: “Third is vaccination. The government has now allowed all people aged over 45 years to be vaccinated. Delhi’s vaccination capacity is now 96,000 and yesterday (Thursday), we vaccinated around 71,000 people. But, in Delhi, we are facing some problems. We are not being able to open more vaccine centres because of strict guidelines of the central government. They allow vaccine centres to be set up in only hospitals. We urge the central government to be lenient in this matter. We can make all arrangements for emergencies. Also, vaccination should now be open for all, irrespective of age. I hope the central government will consider it.”Dr Lalit Kant, former head of the division of epidemiology and communicable diseases at the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), said: “Looking into the current trends, some curbs, especially those targeting large gatherings, especially in closed spaces, should have been good at this point. People have to be more alert now and the government must scale up enforcement against violation of rules concerning face masks and social distancing. If such steps are not taken, things can get worse in the coming days. The current measures are evidently not enough. Delhi has to aggressively scale up tests, tracing, isolation, containment and vaccination efforts.”Delhi, which was one of the earliest hot spots in India’s Covid-19 outbreak, is the only region in the country that has reported three distinct waves of infections and is in its fourth wave. The first started in mid-June last year, and peaked when the seven-day average of daily cases touched around 3,400 in the last week of June. This receded by the end of July when it dropped to around 1,000 daily cases. The second wave started at the end of August, rising until mid-September, when average daily cases touched 4,174 for the week ending September 17. This again dropped to 2,574 in the week ending October 9, before the onset of the third wave.

The 56-day yatra to the 3,880-metre-high shrine is scheduled to start simultaneously from both the routes on June 28 and will culminate on August 22. Devotees can register themselves through 446 designated bank branches across the country — 316 branches of Punjab National Bank, 90 of Jammu and Kashmir Bank and 40 YES Bank branches. At PNB’s Rehari branch in Jammu, devotees turned up in large numbers to submit their forms. Rajinder Kumar, 39, a first-timer, plans to undertake the arduous pilgrimage through the shorter Baltal route. “I am mentally prepared and look forward to undertake this pious pilgrimage. I got myself medically examined at the Sarwal Government Hospital and came to the bank branch to register,” said Rajinder, who will be part of the first batch. Another pilgrim, Vishal Sharma, 27, said he was eagerly waiting to pay obeisance at the cave shrine. “Five of us will be going to the cave shrine. We will make sure we follow all Covid protocols,” he said. Undeterred by threat perception On the threat perception in view of spike in terror attacks in Kashmir, Sharma said, “Come what may, we will pay our respects at the shrine. We are confident of a terror-free pilgrimage because our security forces are working round-the-clock for our safety.” The annual pilgrimage had been cancelled in 2020 because of the coronavirus pandemic and curtailed in 2019 ahead of revocation of Article 370. As many as 3,42,883 people had visited the cave shrine in 2019.In 2018, a total of 2,85,006 pilgrims had undertaken the pilgrimage. This year, the government is making arrangements for six lakh pilgrims. Thousands of pilgrims either trek the traditional and longer 45-km Pahalgam route in Anantnag district or the shorter 14m Baltal route in Ganderbal district to the holy shrine. Shiv Sena demands toll tax exemption The Shiv Sena has appealed the Jammu and Kashmir administration to exempt visiting pilgrims from paying toll tax at the five toll plazas on Lakhanpur-Jammu-Srinagar highway. “The visiting yatris should be exempted from paying toll at the five toll plazas on the highway as the Covid lockdown has hit the common man,” said a party leader. He also demanded that the Banihal-Qazigund tunnel be opened before the annual pilgrimage and the government come up with a permanent shelter for the pilgrims at the Baltal base camp.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/registration-begins-for-amarnath-yatra-101617394325086.html
03-04-2021||Chandigarh||HC notice to Punjab govt, ADGP (traffic), others on plea against ‘faulty’ speed breakers||The Punjab and Haryana High Court has issued a notice of motion to the Punjab government, additional director general of police (traffic), Ludhiana police commissioner and the Ludhiana Municipal Corporation (MC) on a petition against faulty speed breakers that were allegedly resulting in road accidents. Rohit Sabharwal, an RTI activist, had moved the court seeking removal of such speed breakers across the state. He demanded that the speed breakers should be constructed as per the guidelines of the Indian Roads Congress in a way that they are visible to motorists from a distance. The petitioner stated that speed breakers are constructed to reduce the speed of vehicles and maintain an efficient traffic flow. “But illegal and faulty speed breakers are putting the lives of commuters at risk. These humps have been constructed at several points with no check on the height and width and the competent authorities have failed to take action against the same despite complaints,” he maintained.Ludhiana residents have been complaining against faulty speed breakers in Haibowal, Civil Lines, Model Town Extension, Dugri among other areas.Sabharwal also pointed out that the Bombay High Court in 2005 had dealt with a similar case and directed the Maharashtra government that all speed breakers be made as per the Indian Roads Congress specifications. The next hearing in the case was scheduled on July 16.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hc-notice-to-punjab-govt-adgp-traffic-others-on-plea-against-faulty-speed-breakers-101617394026161.html

03-04-2021||Chandigarh||MHA asks Punjab to act on BSF’s ‘bonded labour’ report||The Union ministry of home affairs (MHA) has written to the Punjab government seeking action over a report of the Border Security Force (BSF) claiming that migrants from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh were being used as bonded labourers by farmers in the state’s border villages.In a letter to the Punjab chief secretary and the director general of police (DGP), the MHA cited the report that says these bonded labourers were drugged to make them work for long hours in the fields in Amritsar, Ferozepur, Gurdaspur and Fazilka districts. The BSF had informed the MHA that 58 such migrant labourers, who inadvertently entered the restricted areas near the India-Pakistan border in 2019 and 2020, were handed over to the Punjab Police. The letter reads, “It’s been informed that human trafficking syndicates hire such labourers from their native places on the promise of good salary. But after reaching Punjab, they are exploited, paid poorly and meted out inhuman treatment.”A senior BSF official said eight more such cases were reported this year. He added, “Most of these cases were reported in the Attari block of Amritsar district. Our personnel have been apprehending labourers from Bihar, UP, Madhya Pradesh, Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh while roaming near the international border. During interrogation, it emerged that they were being exploited by the farmers. Some of them were found to be intoxicated. Most of the apprehended migrants were mentally ill. They used to tell that they were not aware where they were living.” These migrants were not being used for cross-border drug smuggling, he clarified.On March 13, the Amritsar (rural) police rescued two bonded migrants working in an illicit liquor manufacturing unit that was busted at Kotli Sakka village of Ajnala sub-division. Attari deputy superintendent of police (DSP) Gurpartap Singh Sahota said BSF hands them over a couple of such migrants every month. Deputy inspector general (DIG Ferozepur range) Hardial Singh Mann said no such case was reported in Tarn Taran and Ferozepur districts. “We are still looking into records to find any,” he added.Jamhuri Kisan Sabha vice-president Rattan Singh Randhawa said, “The farmers don’t force migrants to work for them. There are hundreds of migrants in the border villages who have been working voluntarily for the farmers for food, shelter and clothes. Most of these migrants are from poor families.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/mha-asks-punjab-to-act-on-bsf-s-bonded-labour-report-101617393788171.html

The decision was taken at a high-level meeting with chief secretaries of all the states and UTs. They were asked to strictly implement the test, trace, and treat strategy, and to ensure Covid-appropriate behaviour and vaccination of eligible persons to address the spike in cases. Gauba said, “A clear message needs to go from the top-level to the entire state machinery that all weapons in the armoury need to be utilised along with vaccination to deal with the problem. “ DMs asked to take call on physical classes Amid a spike in Covid-19 cases in different parts of Jammu and Kashmir, the Union Territory administration has asked district magistrates to take a call on the continuation of physical classes in schools in their areas, considering students’ safety.The J&K administration issued the direction after at least 90 students and teachers tested positive for coronavirus in different districts, mostly in Anantnag, Kulgam and Budgam over the last couple of days. “All district magistrates and district disaster management authorities’ chairpersons in J&K shall take a call on the continuation of academic activities (physical classes or online classes) in their respective jurisdictions, keeping in view the safety of students and present trend of pandemic in different districts,” a government order said. The order, issued by school education department deputy secretary Umesh Sharma, said the chief education officer and other authorities will assist the district magistrates in taking such decisions.Satwari school to reopen on Monday Five teachers of Government Girls’ Higher Secondary School, Satwari, whose results had returned unclear on Thursday, have tested negative for the virus.

03-04-2021||Chandigarh||Ex-Punjab DGP Saini, other accused appear in Faridkot court in 2015 police firing cases||Former Punjab director general of police (DGP) Sumedh Singh Saini, suspended inspector general (IG) Paramraj Singh Umaranangal and other accused on Friday appeared in the court of Faridkot additional district and sessions judge in connection with the 2015 Kotkapura and Behbal Kalan police firing cases. Among others who appeared before additional sessions judge Harbans Singh Lekhi are former Moga senior superintendent of police (SSP) Charanjit Singh Sharma, SP Bikramjit Singh, former Bajakhana station house officer (SHO) Amrjit Singh Kular, ex-Akali Dal MLA Mantar Singh Brar. The matter was adjourned to April 27. Charanjit Singh Sharma had filed an application seeking copies of the chargesheets filed against co-accused in the firing cases, after which the court sought reply from the state. Saini on Friday also appeared in the court of Faridkot judicial magistrate (first class) Ekta Uppal for the first time in the 2015 Kotkapura police firing case to furnish bail bonds. However, the court refused to accept his bail bonds stating the application was “not sustainable”. On April 26, the judicial magistrate had issued fresh summons against Saini for April 16, following which he failed to appear in person. At that time, the court had also disposed of Saini’s application seeking exemption from personal appearance, terming it ‘not maintainable’. Saini filed an application for taking up the judicial file on Friday saying he was ready to appear as per the directions and wanted to submit bail and surety bonds.The judge observed that the high court had stayed Saini’s arrest till next hearing in his anticipatory bail plea but the prosecution was at liberty to proceed in accordance with the law. “In the HC orders, there are clearly no directions regarding furnishing of bail bonds by the accused. The directions by the high court are that the arrest of the accused was stayed till the next date. Hence, the defence’s application on this aspect is not sustainable,” she said.The Faridkot district and sessions judge Sumeet Malhotra on Thursday transferred the police firing cases to the court of additional district and sessions judge Harbans Singh Lekhi for trial. In an order, Malhotra issued a list of cases, including those of police firing, which were transferred to the court of additional sessions judge “for disposal in accordance with law”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/expunjab-dgp-saini-other-accused-appear-in-faridkot-court-in-2015-police-firing-cases-101617393665826.html
03-04-2021||Mumbai||Bhandup mall fire: Oct audit highlighted flaws in firefighting system||A Mumbai Fire Brigade (MFB) inspection carried out last October in Bhandup’s Dreams Mall, where a fire last week killed nine Covid-19 patients in Sunrise Hospital located on the third floor, had found that the building’s manual fire alarm and automatic smoke detector system were not functioning. The MFB inspection report dated October 30, 2020 contained 23 observations that signalled the lack of fire safety norms in the building, including the absence of alternative electrical supply and rusted pipes in the firefighting system. A massive fire broke out on the first floor of the mall late on March 25 night which spread to the third floor that houses the Covid-designated hospital. The fire took 40 hours to douse. Of the nine patients killed, most were senior citizens and six were on ventilators. MFB officials at the time confirmed that the building’s fire system, including sprinklers, and fire safety equipment such as fire alarms and smoke detectors, were not functioning. The hospital was started as a Covid-designated hospital in October and was issued temporary permission to function inside the mall till March 31, 2021. The BMC has not extended its permission. The MFB conducted an inspection in several city malls after a fire broke out in City Centre Mall, Tardeo, on October 22. MFB’s October inspection report stated: “Large stock of various scrap materials/ waste materials / packing materials etc are found in the basement and staircase shall be removed with immediate effect and mall management shall not be allowed to keep any materials in the basement and staircase. Pipes used for firefighting systems are rusted at various places. These rusted pipes must be replaced immediately. Electrical shafts should be sealed at each floor level, to prevent spread of heat, smoke and fire at upper floors.”Besides the malfunctioning fire alarm system and automatic smoke detection system, the 23 observations in the report also noted that escape route lighting was not provided on a separate electric circuit and the building did not have a an alternative source of electric supply. The Housing Development and Infrastructure Ltd, which built Dreams Mall, lost the property to the National Company Law Tribunal four years ago. The tribunal appointed Rahul Sahashtrabuddhe as an administrator to run the mall in Bhandup after HDIL failed to pay property taxes, water and electricity charges. Confirming that he was in the know about the MFB report, Sahastrabuddhe said, “I am running the mall with full responsibility and transparency. I have been filing reports with the court every 15 days [since 2018], and I am mentioning all the difficulties in the same. The Mumbai Fire Brigade inspection we are talking about, even there I was very clear that unless all the stakeholders do not comply with the orders of the court, I cannot do complete compliance. The Hon. NCLT has clearly mentioned in its order any stakeholder having any grievance related to functioning of the administrator may raise that before NCLT after making the payment.” The MFB’s October inspection report suggested several measures to make the building fire safety norms-compliant. It is as yet unclear whether the hospital management knew of the inspection report. According to Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), which has undertaken a fire audit of all Covid-19 hospitals and health centres in the wake of the incident, there were 78 patients admitted in the hospital at the time of the fire, of whom two were already dead after failing to recover from Covid-related complications and nine died due to the fire. Currently, two departments of the BMC are conducting an enquiry into the fire: the Disaster Management Cell, which is expected to file its report to the municipal commissioner within the next 10 days, and the building and factory department which is looking into the structural violations of the mall. “The hospital had occupation certificate and also the fire compliance to operate, but we are told there were fire violations inside the mall. However, that is under fire department’s purview, but I have asked my staff to investigate whether there were any other structural violations inside the mall,” assistant municipal commissioner V Acharekar has said last week. The hospital issued a statement on March 27: “Sunrise hospital had filed a complaint against the administrator and appealed to the police to take action against him for not maintaining the mall as per the court orders. The mall was under NCLT and the court appointed administrator was ordered to look after the operations. All the operations at the mall and the licenses of the mall are the responsibility of the court-appointed administrator. All the hospital permissions and licenses were taken and are in order and have nothing to do with the mall compliances.” The Bhandup police booked several people in connection with the fire including directors of the mall, Rakesh Wadhwan, Nikita Amitsingh Trehan, Sarang Wadhwan and Deepak Shirke, and directors of Privilege Healthcare Services Private Limited which owns the hospital, Amitsingh Trehan, Nikita Amitsingh Trehan and Sweetie Jain. The hospital management also called for an investigation to determine how the fire spread. “The fire was on the first floor of Dreams Mall, Bhandup, and not in the hospital. The smoke had reached up to Sunrise Hospital located at the top floor. All fire alarms beeped and hence all patients were safely evacuated due to the smoke to the fire refuge area .There were two dead bodies (due to Covid) which were also evacuated. There was no casualty due to fire. All patients were promptly shifted to Jumbo Covid centre (and some to other private hospitals). The patients were shifted alive, but there were few patients on ventilator and extremely critical. We believe that the casualties have not occurred due to fire, but either in transit or at other hospitals,” the hospital claimed. It further said that the hospital was started in “exceptional circumstances of Covid last year” and was “functioning with all due compliances”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bhandup-mall-fire-oct-audit-highlighted-flaws-in-firefighting-system-101617393484393.html

A growth in goods and services tax (GST) revenue collections was registered despite constraints witnessed during the initial months of the fiscal due to the pandemic, indicating the revival of business and economic activities in the Union Territory, officials said. The revenue collection for April, May and June was ₹68.36 crore, ₹163.71 crore and ₹278.84 crore, respectively, against ₹521.69 crore, ₹393.55 crore, and ₹420.23 crore in 2019. Despite the pandemic, GST revenue showed growth during the second half of the financial year, officials said. The reasons for the buoyancy include several measures taken by the government along with the economic relief package announced in September 2020 for boosting the ailing sectors that had suffered due to the pandemic, they added. The surveillance and monitoring by the J&K tax department in preventing tax evasion also complemented the efforts of the government in this regard, the officials said. Under the motor spirit and diesel oil tax (MST), the collections for 2020-21 was ₹1,459.89 crore against ₹1,421.69 crore in 2019-20, the officials, adding that ₹268 crore was collected under stamps and registrations, Overall, for the financial year 2020-21, the total revenue collections stood at ₹6,618.53 crore as compared to ₹6,472.24 crore in 2019-20, showing a growth of 2.26%, the officials said||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/jk-registers-2-94-growth-in-gst-collections-101617393424993.html
03-04-2021||Mumbai||Illegal felling of trees in Marol: BMC probes claims||The tree authority of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) is currently investigating allegations of large-scale tree-felling by a private developer in Marol, in response to complaints from citizens and a point of order raised by a member during the authority’s last meeting on March 23.After receiving complaints from multiple residents on Church Road near the Airport Metro station over the last few months, Abhijit Samant, corporator (ward no. 84) and member of the tree authority, had demanded on March 23 that an inquiry report be submitted in the matter. “Prima facie, it seems that a developer in the area has felled many more trees than they had been given permission for. Close to 292 trees had to be retained on site, but locals have levelled serious allegations that the plot is now empty,” said Samant. “The entire plot was completely green last September or October,” said Aldrin Lobo, resident of Everest Society on Church Road.In September 2020, the tree authority had granted permission to Rockfort Estate Developers to cut 11 trees at the site for a proposed commercial building. Another 41 trees were mandated for transplanting in the vicinity while 292 trees were to be retained at the site. A copy of the permission letter is with HT. An HT team visited the site on Wednesday and found that while 41 trees have been transplanted to the edge of the plot, at least seven of these trees were either dead or on the verge of dying. HT was unable to observe 292 trees on the plot as identified in the tree authority’s permission letter.Jitendra Pardeshi, head of the tree authority, confirmed that he is aware of the matter. “The BMC chief has taken cognizance of the complaint and a report will be submitted to him next week.”A spokesperson for Rockfort Estate Developers, however, refuted the allegations, maintaining that they have followed all instructions. “We have followed directions of MCGM in totality without any deviation. We are above board and extremely transparent in what we are doing,” said the spokesperson in a text message to HT.A member of the developer’s horticulture and landscaping department confirmed that they have also responded to the tree authority’s show cause notice on December 24, 2020. “Some trees like Subhabool can die naturally is adequate water isn’t available... During the lockdown the horticulture staff was not available to take care of the trees. Also, hutment dwellers from surrounding areas disturbed the trees by breaking the branches. They cut the branches and used for fire camps within our plot... All the trees dried/died are because of these reasons.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/illegal-felling-of-trees-bmc-probes-claims-101617393364450.html

The court after verifying the age of the woman noted that as the woman had expressed unwillingness to speak or meet with her parents, they should not try to make her change her decision and also directed the father of the man from causing any harm to the parents of the woman. A division bench of justice Ravindra Ghuge and justice BU Debadwar while hearing the petition filed by the father of the woman was informed that following its earlier order to the police to bring the woman before it, the woman had come voluntarily. The court verified the age of the woman through her Aadhaar card and confirmed that she was 18 years and six months old, hence an adult. On the query of the court, the woman informed that she had eloped with the man who is two years older than her as she was in love with him and they planned to get married once he attained the legal age for marriage. The woman further submitted that after she left her father’s house she had been living with the man at a location unknown to both parents and would prefer it to be that way till they got married. She also submitted that she needed protection from her father as he was furious at her relationship with the man and had also assaulted the man’s father. After hearing the woman and getting an assurance from the father of the woman that neither he nor his relatives would harm the daughter or her lover, the court noted, “if the missing girl or respondent No.5 (the man) suffer any physical harm and if they allege that the petitioner has caused the said harm, the petitioner would then be liable for action, in accordance with law.” The court while directing the father of the man to also show restraint said, “Since the missing girl is an adult and respondent No.5 is also an adult, though not of a marriageable age, we have no reason to detain the missing girl, considering the specific replies given by her, as recorded herein above,” and directed the police to escort the woman and the man till a bus so that they may go to the desired destination without being stopped or harmed by anyone and disposed of the petition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/hc-refuses-to-detain-missing-woman-who-eloped-with-lover-101617393304898.html

It has breached 2.9 million mark, pushing the count to 2,904,076. It was the second consecutive day when the state reported 40,000 plus cases and third consecutive day when fatalities crossed the 200-mark. Similarly, Mumbai also reported a record number of cases — 8,844.Terming the situation as worrisome, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray warned that he will have to re-impose lockdown if the situation persists and cases continue to rise sharply.The ongoing surge has resulted in a sharp rise in active cases as well that rose to 389,832, which comes to 13.42% of the total cases. It means a rise of 12% in less than two months. On February 11, there were 35,633 active cases against 2,052,253 total cases, which comes to 1.73%.

If the current growth in Covid cases continues for the next 15-20 days, all the hospital beds will be full, there could also be a shortage of oxygen,” he pointed out.According to health experts, the cases will continue to rise sharply in the coming days before hitting a plateau.Dr Rahul Pandit, member of the state-appointed task force for the clinical management of critical patients, said, “The sharp rise in cases will continue in the coming days. We are expecting to hit the plateau hopefully in this month after which the cases will start coming down gradually. The daily cases have shot up as the state has increased daily testing in big numbers and also improved tracking contacts of Covid patients.”He said the state will have to continue increasing testing figures until the positivity rate comes down to 5% or below to control the situation.In the past 24 hours, the state tested 183,378 samples, highest ever in a day, and had a positivity rate of 26.08%. The overall positivity rate of the state stood at 14.41%.

The report of carcass samples sent to ICAR’s National Institute of High-Risk Animal Disease Laboratory, Bhopal, is awaited. “The lake has been closed for visitors. We are taking all precautionary measures. We are conducting a throrough surveillance of the area,” Prajapati said, adding that there was no ban on movement of people in peripheral areas. The last bird flu outbreak in December had claimed the lives of at least 5,000 migratory birds in the sanctuary. The highest mortality has been observed in bar-headed geese that migrate from Mongolia to Pong Dam in winter. This season, 40,570 bar-headed geese were spotted at the lake, making it the most populous bird species on the lake. Birds from the south may have brought the infection: Officials Forest officials suspect that birds flying from the south may have carried the infection. These birds use Pong Lake as a stopover while returning to their homeland. The Pong wetland in Himachal Pradesh’s Kangra district is one of the largest man-made wetlands in North India. It was formed after the construction of a dam on the Beas river in 1974. This wetland offers a transitory resting reserve for migratory birds coming from the trans-Himalayan zone in winter when the temperature plunges in wetlands of Europe and North and Central Asia. Flocks of waterfowls that breed in these areas in summer undertake migration to Pong wetlands to spend winter in congenial climatic conditions from October to March every year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/bird-flu-resurgence-sanctuary-at-pong-lake-closed-amid-avian-deaths-101617393126364.html
03-04-2021||Mumbai||City records 8,844 new Covid cases||After 8,646 cases on Thursday, the city on Friday again reported more than 8,000 cases, with its 24-hour tally at 8,844. The city also reported 19 deaths in the city. With the number of cases going up, the daily growth rate in the city has gone up to over 18%, with active cases going above 57,000. The increase in cases has also resulted in bed occupancy going up to around 72%, however, along with it, the recovery rate in the last one month has also fallen down to 84% from 94% in January. The growth rate in the city was around 5-7% that went up to around 8-10% mid-March, from where it has now gone up to 18%, as of Thursday. This is partially owing to tests and tracing, but also due to crowding at several places including markets, said a BMC official.The official added, “Despite urging citizens not to crowd, we are witnessing crowding in vegetable markets, including Dadar. We are conducting random testing citizens at crowded places, including malls, markets etc.”On Friday, for the second consecutive day, Dadar reported 100 cases. On Thursday, Dadar had reported 104 cases. According to BMC’s data, Dadar has reported 6,284 cases in the last one year of which 5,098 have been discharged. Neighbouring Dharavi on Friday saw 73 cases, taking the total to 5,058 cases, of which 4,047 have been discharged.According to the state health department data, the city’s case tally is 432,367 and the toll is 11,727 followed by 361,985 recoveries and 57,687 active cases. Mayor Kishori Pednekar on Thursday had warned about strict restrictions, including shutting of malls, religious places, restrictions on opening of shops followed by travel restrictions for non-essential workforce. However, the BMC has maintained they have not received any such directive from the state.Dr Siddarth Paliwal, a city-based physician, said, “If the tests are doubled, we will see double the cases in February or January. To ensure the spread is limited, Central government needs to allow vaccination for all age groups.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/city-records-8-844-new-covid-cases-101617393124474.html

The PIL filed is expected to be mentioned on Monday before HC for urgent hearing. The litigation filed by advocates Dhruti Kapadia and Kunal Tiwari states that they approached HC after they discovered that the state government in its response to the civic body’s letter on starting door-to-door vaccine drive had refused permission on the grounds that there was no policy for initiating such a facility. “Facilitating such groups of people who need vaccine should be the responsibility of the respondent authorities. If they are unable to provide every citizen who are of advanced age and not in a position to go to the centres a vaccine, then they are violating such people’s right to life and good health under Article 21 of the Constitution,” the petition states. The PIL further goes on say, “There are specially-abled citizens across the country who are eligible for the vaccination but are unable to visit the Covid-19 centres due to their disability. If the door-to-door vaccination facility is made available to them, then they will get vaccinated in time without causing further health disaster.” Suggesting that a charge of around ₹500 could be fixed as home visit charges, the PIL also seeks directions to allow vaccination without Aadhaar /PAN cards and setting up of a helpline number for advanced age senior citizens to book an appointment for home visit of a doctor for Covid-19 vaccine. “Some senior citizens do not even know how to register online and are unable to book appointments independently. Some citizens who are medically sick and do not have Aadhaar or PAN cards and are unable to register and book appointments, due to which they are unable to get vaccinated,” the PIL states. The PIL points to the fact that after some senior citizens faced problems at vaccination centres like waiting in long queues for four-five hours for their turn to get vaccinated, the petitioners had raised concerns before local public representatives. The petition is likely to come up for hearing next week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/pil-seeking-door-to-door-vaccine-services-for-senior-citizens-specially-abled-moved-before-bombay-hc-101617393064370.html

03-04-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: Wall of times past||It’s like coming face-to-face with the indecipherable relics of a lost civilisation.The pale pink wall, here in Old Delhi’s Meena Bazar, is defaced with two acronyms: STD and PCO. A quick Google search confirms that STD stands for ‘Subscriber Trunk Dialing’ and PCO are the initials of ‘Public Call Office’.Those among us who aren’t millennials, and who have lived in the BM era—Before Mobile—might recall that STD and PCO used to be a way of life in every little lane of the city. The former was the dialing code of a city or town that had to precede the number of the person you were to call, and PCOs were little cabins where folks who didn’t have a phone at home would come to make a call. (Nowadays, romantic lovers have mobile phones to carry on clandestine affairs away from the prying eyes of the family. Earlier, they would have to go to a PCO, preferably not the one in the neighbourhood.)But the sight on this wall arouses more than just a little nostalgia. It is profoundly poignant. Usually, a PCO would have a proper board hanging on the wall, displaying the same acronyms. But here the letters seem to be crudely hammered into the concrete, like a bored student’s name etched with a compass on a wooden desk.Now a young man passes by. Nadeem lives and works in Meena Bazar, an extremely cramped market filled with little shops selling everything from pumps and juice mixers to bridal suits and chicken biryani. An eatery cook, the lungi-wearing Nadeem has noticed this sign but never thought much of it. “I didn’t know it was related to phones… I have my personal phone to call my family in Benares, and everybody else around me have their own mobiles too.”It is still early morning and most shops are still shuttered. The alleys are almost empty and the people going about seem to be of a generation not related to the PCO. One can only imagine that here was a very modest telephone booth, and since the area is home to a large number of labourers, the telephone must have been forever busy with men calling up their families and friends back home in the village.Whatever, you ought to come here to gaze upon this sign. In the age of mobile, it has the gravitas of a museum installation.And if you walk further along the market lanes, you will spot lots of names and numbers jotted on the walls. These are the mobile numbers of people living here as well as of stall owners, informs Nadeem. This wall has evolved with the phone.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-wall-of-times-past-101617392565188.html

03-04-2021||Chandigarh||3% jump in Himachal’s revenue collection despite pandemic: Jai Ram||Himachal chief minister Jai Ram Thakur on Friday said that the hill-state had registered a 3% increase in revenue collection in the 2020-21 financial year despite the pandemic affecting economic activities. “The excise and taxation department had registered a 52% decrease in revenue collection in the first quarter. However, once the disruption caused by the virus in the initial months of the outbreak subsided, the revenue has consistently grown by 4%, 23% and 34% in second, third and fourth quarters, respectively,” the CM said. There was a 44% increase in revenue in March with the state collecting ₹1,006 crore against ₹699 crore last year, Thakur said, adding that revenue receipts under VAT and state GST had registered a significant growth of 182% and 31%, respectively, in March.The CM attributed the increase in VAT collections to the success of the legacy cases resolution scheme (LCRS). Under the scheme, the department has recovered ₹362 crore by disposing of cases of subsumed taxes, of which ₹182 crore has been collected in March alone.“The primary reason for overall growth in revenue receipts has been revival of economic activities, the government’s unlock strategy, compliance by taxpayers and better administration by the department,” Thakur said. “New initiatives by the department, especially monitoring of field units through performance cards, has created a healthy competitive environment across field formations, which has motivated officers to beat the assigned targets,” he said, adding that the department had recently started another initiative to evaluate its own performance using a performance card.The CM said the department had identified focus areas for augmenting the state’s revenue collections, including recoveries under LCRS, physical verifications of e-way bills, compliance of GSTR3B return filings, recovery of interest for late filing of returns, recovery of ineligible ITC, recovery of tax deficits and mismatches and identification of cases pertaining to tax evasions and erroneous refunds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/3-jump-in-himachal-s-revenue-collection-despite-pandemic-jai-ram-101617392525699.html

The Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) partners – Shiv Sena, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and Congress – on Friday said the incident puts the credibility of the Election Commission in question and that poll body should take steps to clean up its act. NCP has also demanded a criminal inquiry into the incident. “EVM in a BJP candidate’s car is a serious matter. People already have doubts over EVMs, and this [incident] has added to it. It is also a breach of the election code of conduct. This needs to be thoroughly investigated and a case must be filed against both the officials concerned and the BJP candidate in whose car the EVM was found,” said NCP’s chief spokesperson and state minority affairs minister Nawab Malik. The incident occurred at Karimganj district in Ratabari constituency, where the EC staff took a private vehicle without checking its ownership after the vehicle assigned to them broke down. The private car belonged to the wife of Krishnendu Paul, a BJP candidate from the nearby Patharkandi seat. The Shiv Sena said it was a classic example of how the BJP wins the elections. “They do this EVM tampering very selectively and this is how their whole poll machinery works,” said Sena parliamentarian and former Union minister Arvind Sawant. “Imagine, the EC officials took the car of a BJP leader to transport EVM to the store room and they claim they just took a random car. All this raises suspicion,” said Sawant. The Congress said such incidents only derail the faith of citizens in the democratic process. “All this is a part of the dirty game by BJP, and even the EC is unable to rein them,” said Congress spokesperson Sachin Sawant. Former Union minister and Congress leader Milind Deora recalled the incident in 2019 when he had lodged a complaint with EC about the tampering of EVMs in Mumbai. “During the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, I received reliable information that EC officials were in nexus with the NDA (National Democratic Alliance) candidates, and had done some mischief with EVM machines. In that case, however, no one got caught like in Assam, where it’s seems to be a direct nexus between EC officials and ruling party,” said Deora. He said that he does not believe in technological hacking, but physical hacking by such instances is possible,” said Deora, the former head of the Mumbai Congress, who had fought the Lok Sabha seat in 2019. The state BJP has refuted the allegations of party involvement in the incident. “If we wanted to manipulate the machines, how come the seal was intact? EC is an independent body and functions autonomously. If we had so much control on EC, we would have won all the states hands down. The problem with our opponents is EVMs are perfect where they win and manipulated when they lose,” said BJP legislator Ram Kadam.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/maharashtras-ruling-alliance-condemns-assam-evm-incident-calls-it-bjp-ec-nexus-101617392524405.html

Some were placed outside the hall as well. During veneration, people were asked to just touch the cross and to sanitise their hands right after. For holy communion, similar preparations have been done. We also conducted a parallel programme at our Nayagaon church and urged people living nearby to go there.”The Sector-18 Christ Church conducted the service online like last year. Secretary Parkash Masih said, “The sermon was delivered online. For Easter, we will hold regular service from 11am to 5pm on Sunday, however, people will be urged to come and pray for five minutes only. No Easter lunch will be held and instead, packaged snacks will be provided.”The Tricity Church Association also held a simple event this year. Chairman Father Premanand said, “Our congregation on Friday was limited. In Manimajra, around 100 people were allowed; in the army cantonment area of Chandimandir, only 40 people were allowed and no civilians.”President of the association Lawrence Malik said they will keep the event lowkey on Easter Sunday as well.

In the suit, Waikar has claimed that Somaiya made “malicious” allegations about him not disclosing in his election affidavit the details of some property, which he allegedly purchased at Alibag, from late architect Anvay Naik. The suit has claimed that such “unsubstantiated allegations” by Somaiya has caused mental agony, and hence, Waikar sought a restraint on the BJP leader from making such statements, and to pay damages. The suit filed by Waikar and his wife Manisha, through advocate Tamsin Monis, has averred that since January, Somaiya through various social media platforms – television and print media and press conferences – started making allegations about the legislator involved constructing bungalows on the Alibag plot and being a beneficiary of a sizeable sum of money in the allotment of a development project by the civic body to two developers in Andheri (East). The suit has claimed that Somaiya had levelled ‘unsubstantiated’ statements against the plaintiffs, alleging non-declaration of assets and giving false information on oath before the Election Commission (EC). Refuting the allegations, the couple has stated that they have “at all times made full disclosures in their declarations filed before EC”. “The existence of the alleged 19 bungalows on Korlai plot is fiction of the defendant’s imagination, and the defendant is put to strict proof thereof as regards to all statements made by him. As for statements alleging benefit of ₹25 crore, the plaintiffs have no concern of whatsoever nature with the two developers and are not concerned with any development granted to these persons by BMC. The defendant is put to strict proof thereof for the statements creating grave attacks on the integrity of plaintiffs,” the suit stated. Enumerating the “agony” caused by such allegations by Somaiya, the Waikars have stated, “With haphazard knowledge, the defendant has claimed and attributed several illegal acts to plaintiff, which has caused immense embarrassment to plaintiffs. The plaintiffs believe and have observed on multiple occasions that these press conferences and blatant statements made by the defendant, is a modus operandi used by him against many others, to cause harassment and to unsettle them.” The suit claims that amidst the current issue surrounding Naik’s suicide, Somaiya has cooked up the stories only to divert the focus from actual perpetrators. The suit filed by Waikar, therefore, stated that every allegation made by Somaiya is “ex-facie defamatory and injuring reputation of plaintiffs…trying to portray an illusionary existence of several non-existing profitable transactions for commercial benefits.” In light of this, the Waikars sought direction from the court to order damages of ₹100 crore to be paid by the defendant, and permanently restraining from in any manner maligning the reputation of the plaintiff without substantive proof through social media, press conferences and pending hearing sought an interim relief of the same nature. The suit will come up for hearing in due course. Responding to the suit, Somaiya said that as suspended cop Sachin Vaze was in prison, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray was trying to recover the ₹100 crore from him through the suit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/shiv-sena-mla-ravindra-waikar-files-100-cr-suit-against-bjp-leader-101617392284352.html

The Sena leader called the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA), an “ideal government”, where the three ideologically different parties came together to form a ruling coalition in the state. “MVA is such an experiment in the country’s political history that all non-BJP parties should learn something from. The Congress, NCP and Shiv Sena, which are three ideologically different parties, are running the government for the past one-and-a-half years, and I think it is an ideal government. Such an alliance through the UPA (United Progressive Alliance) should be created. Banerjee has suggested the same. Maharashtra has shown a new direction to country’s politics. What Maharashtra has shown must be emulated at the national level,” Raut said while speaking to reporters in Mumbai. In the letter, written on March 28, Banerjee said BJP wants to make it “impossible for non-BJP parties to exercise their constitutional rights and freedoms”. “It wants to dilute the powers of state governments and downgrade them to mere municipalities. In short, it wants to establish a one-party authoritarian rule in India,” her letter said. Referring to the Centre’s National Capital Territory of Delhi (Amendment) Bill, which was recently passed in both houses of the Parliament an “extremely grave” development, Banerjee said that the Centre wants to snatch away power of a democratically elected government in Delhi. Raut said that Maharashtra has shown the direction, and now an MVA-like alliance at the national level under the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) should be formed. He said that it is “crucial” for opposition parties to come together to address the challenges addressed by Banerjee in the letter. “All the opposition leaders must sit together and find a way. After the Emergency in 1975, Jayprakash Narayan brought all opposition parties together, but unfortunately there is no such leader today,” he said. The Sena mouthpiece Saamana on Friday also wrote that though Banerjee has written for all parties to unite, her Trinamool Congress and the Congress party are contesting against each other in the ongoing West Bengal Assembly elections. “In reality, Trinamool Congress and Congress are not hand in hand, but against each other in the West Bengal election. Therefore, the opposition should have started uniting from Kolkata. But if Banerjee thinks everybody should come together after BJP’s attack [during the campaign] in West Bengal, we respect the sentiments,” the editorial read.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/maharashtra-vikas-aghadi-an-ideal-govt-oppn-must-emulate-it-in-india-sanjay-raut-101617392105482.html

03-04-2021||Chandigarh||Mother can’t be denied child’s custody on infidelity allegations: HC||The Punjab and Haryana high court has said that allegations of infidelity against the mother can’t be a ground for denying her custody of children below the age of five years.The high court bench of justice Sudhir Mittal observed that the Guardian Act as well as the Minority Act leave no manner of doubt that the welfare of the minor was the paramount consideration to be kept in mind by the court while appointing a guardian, and ordinarily to serve the best of interests of the children below five years of age, the custody should be with the mother.In the case at hand, a Panchkula woman had challenged a trial court order in which the custody of her daughter aged below five years and 11-year-old son was given to her husband. The trial court had observed that the allegations from either side could not be taken into consideration as they had not been proven through evidence. But the high court observed that the trial court had been influenced by the allegations made against the mother which was “a perversity requiring correction”.Quashing the trial court order of February 2020, the high court not only granted custody of the girl child to the mother, but also gave the custody of the boy to her, observing that the boy could not be separated from his sister as it would traumatise both of them.The couple were married in 2008, and the male child was born in 2009, the girl child in 2017. The couple got separated in February 2019. The mother had alleged that she had been thrown out of the house, harassed and tortured for dowry and had not been permitted to take the children along with her.The estranged husband had submitted that the wife did not possess the resources to maintain herself, and that she was a person of questionable character. If given the custody of the children, their normal development would suffer, the father had argued. Children miss their mother: Amicus curiaeAn amicus curiae was appointed by the court in the case, who had reported that the children missed their mother, and the male child was being indoctrinated against her. Despite that, he was keen on meeting her and enjoyed her company, it was reported.An amicus curiae is someone who is not a party to a case who assists a court by offering information, expertise, or insight that has a bearing on the issues in the case.The court found that the mother had been working for over 10 years after marriage and was still working. Based on this, it concluded that she possessed the means to maintain her children. However, court has allowed visitation rights to the husband.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/mother-can-t-be-denied-child-s-custody-on-infidelity-allegations-hc-101617391986399.html

This is for the first time that the revenue from mining works have crossed the ₹1,000-crore mark,” said Sharma, who also holds the transport department portfolio.Ensuring availability of construction material at reasonable prices and curbing illegal mining top our agenda, he said. He said that stringent steps were being taken to bring illegal mining to zero level and prevent revenue loss.“The disposal of pending appeals at government level has been expedited and the focus is on recovery of arrears from contractors and lease holders,” he said.Sharma said that a special enforcement team, consisting of 55 police officers and employees, has been constituted to prevent illegal mining in Haryana.The online portal introduced for transportation of minerals is proving to be effective in curbing illegal mining and transportation, he added.Registration of mineral-filled vehicles has been made necessary, he said, adding that mineral loading will be done according to loading capacity of vehicles to prevent practice of overloading of vehicles.He said that contracts are being awarded to small mining units and blocks with an intention to increase competition in the area and to give opportunity to small entrepreneurs as well.To ensure transparency in the process of leasing or contracting mining units, e-auction has been started. He said that auctioning of four mines in Faridabad, where stocks of Yamuna sand are kept, will be done soon.Apart from this, the process of auctioning empty mines in other districts is also being implemented.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/mining-operations-yield-rs-1-023-crore-revenue-in-haryana-101617391985271.html
03-04-2021||Chandigarh||No hourly parking rates for now in Chandigarh||The Chandigarh municipal corporation has deferred the implementation of hourly parking rates.The decision came after the latest inspection of parking lots revealed that both contractors are yet to implement smart features, a prerequisite to impose the hourly charges.MC commissioner KK Yadav said: “Initially, the inspection committee had submitted that one of the contractors has installed most of the smart features. After the contractor claimed he has now completed the installation, I directed the committee to re-examine the parking lots and submit a report.”After the new rates kick in, the parking fee for the first four hours will remain the same as the flat rates charged right now: ₹5 for two-wheelers and ₹10 for four-wheelers. Thereafter, these will be doubled. The charges will be further doubled if vehicles are parked beyond 12 hours.Parking lots in the city have been divided into two zones: 32 in Zone 1 and 57 in Zone 2. The MC had auctioned both zones for around ₹10 crore annually. In October last year, the MC had directed parking contractors to offer all smart features at 89 parking lots being run by them within one month. The deadline had to be extended couple of times. Later on, the MC decided to implement hourly charges in a phased manner, which again has been deferred.The smart features include e-ticketing, HD night-vision CCTV cameras, smart card passes, LED display of real-time occupancy and online booking of parking space.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/no-hourly-parking-rates-for-now-in-chandigarh-101617391925081.html

The Bambiha gang orchestrated the shooting with the help of Bhupi and wanted to kill Maneesh and Amandeep, alias Manni, of the Bishnoi gang,” said the SSP.Pardeep and Rahul along with two others had come to Ambala in a Hyundai Verna car, with a Chandigarh registration number ending in 1620, for a hearing in a 2019 case of gang war inside Ambala Central Jail. As many as 84 inmates were booked after those affiliated to the Bishnoi gang allegedly attacked Bhupi’s men.Maneesh and Manni, who were also in Ambala for the same hearing, were also expected to arrive in a Hyundai Verna with the number ending in 2620, but came in another vehicle. The hearing did not take place as it was suspended after a court staffer tested positive.“The difference of just one digit in the car registration numbers led to the killings of Pardeep and Rahul, while Maneesh and Manni escaped in their car,” said the SSP. P’kula man had done recceThe police had arrested the first accused in the case — Rakesh Kumar, a history-sheeter facing 12 criminal cases — from Panchkula on Holi. He had done the recce on orders of Bhupi, who was lodged in the Kurukshetra jail.Rakesh had been an inmate with Bhupi in the same barrack in Ambala Central Jail in 2019, said the SSP.“Rakesh was also present at the court complex on the day of the shooting and had met Maneesh at an eatery. He told Maneesh to come with him, but the later refused apparently suspecting something was amiss and left in his vehicle,” he said.This is when Pardeep and Rahul, who had too left from the court, were followed by the shooters in their Maruti Suzuki Swift car and shot dead near Kalka Chowk. More than 20 rounds were fired on their car, which also left the driver and the person sitting next to him injured. The shooters, said to be two or three in number, are still absconding. Apology on FacebookMembers of the Bambiha gang had posted on social media about “avenging the killers of Meet Bouncer” soon after the shooting on March 25.However, after they got to know that those killed were not from the Bishnoi gang, the post was deleted and an apology was issued instead, the SSP said.A Facebook post written in Punjabi reads, “Due to a misunderstanding, two families were destroyed and we are responsible for it… We seek an apology from the families of our two brothers. May lord give enough strength to them…”Bhupi, who belongs to Handesra village in Mohali, is said to have been a close aide of Bambiha, who was shot dead during an encounter with Punjab Police in Bathinda in 2016.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/bhupi-rana-s-own-men-got-killed-in-ambala-gang-war-ssp-101617391805056.html
03-04-2021||Delhi||Infections soar as Delhi adds 3,594 more cases, 14 deaths||The number of new coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases in Delhi have nearly doubled over the last two days, with the city adding 3,594 infections on Friday, as against 1,819 on Wednesday, with health experts calling for non-essential activities to be restricted to prevent the current surge from spiralling out of control.Friday’s spike was the highest single-day spike since December 4, when Delhi added 4,067 infections.The Capital added the last 10,000 infections in five days, the 10,000 cases before it in eight days, and the 10,000 before that in 33 days, shows data released by the Delhi government, indicating the exponential spread of the virus in the city over the past two weeks.This comes as chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, during a press briefing on Friday, expressed concerns over the fourth wave of the infection in the city, and urged the Centre to open the vaccination drive for everyone above the age of 18.The city also recorded 14 deaths due to the viral infection on Friday, the most in a single day since January 12 when the city recorded 16 deaths. So far, the disease has killed 11,050 people in the city.As per the data, Delhi had added the last 100 deaths to its toll in 15 days as against 47 days for the 100 deaths before that. During the surge in cases in November, the city had reported the highest 131 deaths in a day.After addressing an urgent meeting with the health department to discuss the case surge in the Capital, the chief minister on Friday said infections during the current wave were less severe and less fatal than in the past.Currently, the cumulative case fatality rate (CFR) – proportion of deaths among those who test positive for the infection – stands at 1.65%. The city’s highest CFR so far was 4.1% in June, when health professionals were still finalising treatment protocol for the infection.“ICU beds in my hospital are filling up. I have patients who urgently need oxygen, I am seeing the same kind of CT scan that I saw last year. There is no evidence so far to suggest that the infection has become milder. Yes, the case fatality rate has definitely gone down across the country from 3 or 4% to around 1.5%. There are fewer deaths taking place because people are aware of the disease and are reaching hospital on time. Doctors have also gained experience in treating Covid-19 patients and know what works,” said Dr GC Khilnani, former head of the department of pulmonology at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS). He is currently the chairperson of PSRI Institute of pulmonary, critical care and sleep medicine.He said, “Another reason that fewer hospitalisations are taking place is that younger people are getting the infections at the moment. They are the ones travelling, going to the market and to parties.”The city has seen a steady increase in the number of hospitalisations, from just 489 at the beginning of March to 2,255 as on Thursday night, reported a day later in Friday’s health bulletin.In the same period, the number of active cases — those currently infected — went up from 1,404 to 11,994, according to data shared by the Delhi government.“If there is a susceptible population, the number of cases will keep going up and down. Although the seroprevalence in Delhi was 56% [according to the fifth sero survey in January] and many have been vaccinated, the infection started spreading among the others when those who had been at home started stepping out when cases fell in December and January... But a lockdown is not the answer,” said Dr Puneet Mishra, professor of community medicine at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences.He added, “However, everyone needs to follow social distancing norms and mask up. Unnecessary gatherings should be curtailed.”The Delhi government last week introduced curbs on gatherings, limiting them to 200 people in open spaces, 100 in closed halls, and 50 people in funerals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/infections-soar-as-delhi-adds-3-594-more-cases-14-deaths-101617391592739.html

As per the order, the arrears are to be paid in two instalments -- one before March 31 and the other on or before May 31.According to PSPCL officials, out of the total arrears of ₹1, 750 crore, Nabha Power Limited (NPL), which operates the Rajpura thermal plant, will get about ₹1, 100 crore, comprising ₹750 crore as the principal amount and about ₹350 crore as the interest amount while the rest will go to the Tawlandi Sabo power plant.PSPCL will inform the Punjab State Electricity Regulatory Commission (PSERC) about the payments to the independent power producers (IPPs) in the last financial year, and the balance amount payable before May 31 this year.PSPCL paid ₹1, 423 crore as coal washing charges to the IPPs in 2020, and to recover the amount, it had brought in a hike of 30 paise per unit in the current tariff cycle (2020-21). For recovery of the remaining ₹1, 750 crore, PSPCL will have to increase the tariff by around 40 paise for another year, or adjust its Annual Revenue Requirement petition, if it doesn’t ask for tariff revision.As per the tariff proposal for the financial year 2021-22, submitted by PSPCL on January 25 to PSERC, the commission plans to recover the gap of ₹9, 807 crore during the next 2 to 5 years so that there is no tariff increase but some relief for domestic consumers with a load up to 7KW can be granted.After the regulator agrees to defer any amount for the next year, these become regulatory assets. Regulatory assets are those expenses of electricity distribution companies that they can legally pass on to customers with a hike in tariff but are deferred for the time being.“Now, the payment of coal washing charges to be recoverable from the consumers can lead to tariff increase or PSERC can be requested to add this amount also to regulatory assets,” said a power engineer.All India Power Engineers Association (AIPEF) spokesman VK Gupta said PSPCL lost the case of coal washing because of faulty replies to pre-bid queries during the tendering process. “The officials are responsible for this gross mistake, which has taken a toll of ₹3200 crore on the consumers’ pocket, should be punished for failing to protect the interests of state during the bidding process,” he said.PSPCL CMD A Venu Parsad said PSPCL has saved a lot of money with cost cutting, timely payment of interests, and efficient management of resources. “I assure you that we will survive the burden of this payment of ₹1, 750 crore through internal working, and won’t ask for tariff hike for this amount.”He said the PSPCL is studying the verdict and may go for fresh petition before the regulator on certain issues, as allowed by Supreme court, on certain issues which can save cost of power purchase from private thermal plants.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/coal-washing-charges-pspcl-releases-rs-800-cr-to-private-thermal-plants-101617391626273.html

While the reason for increasing the first hike (of 30%) was not revealed, MoCA has attributed the second hike (of an additional 5%) to an increase in aircraft turbine fuel price. On March 21, aviation minister Hardeep Puri said that India has brought back 6.76 million stranded passengers with the help of the special Vande Bharat Mission (VBM) international flights since last May. According to the government, over 8,500 distressed Indians returned to the country on March 20 alone.Experts have said that though the hike is a good step for airlines, it might not go well with passengers. On contrary to the aviation minister’s claims, experts also said that the demand for air travel has not been good, and with the 35% hike, the demand might get affected further.Rajji Rai, chairman of Swift group of industries, said, “This is a steep increase on the lower limit of the airfare band from a passenger’s point of view. The ministry should have increased the lower limit of the airfare band at regular intervals. But because the government suddenly increased it by 30%, it hasn’t gone well with the passengers. Airlines have pushed their way through because they are finding it difficult to survive, but as an authority, the ministry should have increased the prices in parts instead of increasing it by 35% within a month.”CS Subbiah, former chief executive officer (CEO) of Alliance Air, said, “According to me, the ministry has taken a cautious call by increasing the lower limit of the band. The government has to allow the airlines to operate on their own. It has been nine months that the airspace has reopened after complete lockdown. Though everyone has suffered losses, the airlines have suffered more, and are financially weak. The government seems to be slowly moving towards deregulation, and increasing the airfares needed as per the market conditions. As long as maximum fares are not increased, increasing the lower limit of the band is not an issue, as it also gives confidence to airlines to run their business.”Commenting on continuing with the 80% flight capacity restrictions by the ministry, Subbiah said, “Flights are still not seeing full loads, hence the government might wait till the summer vacation to see the response. Even if the air traffic reaches 70% of that recorded in 2019, then they might slowly increase the flight capacity to 100%.”According to aviation expert Vipul Saxena the increase in Covid-19 cases as well as with more states making a test report compulsory for travel, the passenger traffic will be affected. “People will travel only in unavoidable situations. I see heavy fall in numbers till June. The increase in minimum fare cap will further impact passenger traffic. However, I am hopeful of an airfare war due to poor demand,” said Saxena.Thane resident Savita Yadav believes that with the air tickets getting costlier and states imposing more restrictions amid the rise in Covid-19 cases, the situation is too volatile to plan a travel. “A Mumbai-Dehradun roundtrip ticket for May 14 starts from ₹12,000. The rates for the sector in February first week were around ₹ 9,000.But I did not book my tickets then, as making travel plans in advance is risky these days. However, now the air tickets are costlier and the situation is too volatile,” said Yadav.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/35-fare-hike-can-impact-air-traffic-experts-101617391564357.html

I brought wheat of three acre to the Karnal grain market but was not allowed to enter the mandi for hours,” alleged farmer Bhupinder Singh, of Bijna village.He said that he had done registration for 450 quintal and 14 acre is ready for harvest but he did not get any SMS yet.After the mandi officials did not give him gate pass, the protesting farmers unloaded their wheat outside the office of mandi secretary and said that they will continue their protests till government start procurement.Jagdip Singh Aulakh, a local BKU leader, alleged that chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar and deputy CM Dushyant Chautala are making tall claims that the procurement has started in all mandis in state but there are no buyers in Karnal grain market and farmers are not allowed to bring in their produce.“Four farmers brought their produce in Karnal mandi and six had brought their produce to Indri grain market on April 1 but not even a single grain was procured yet. Government should not make such misleading and false claims,” he alleged.The farmer union leaders have asked the farmers to bring their produce to mandis without SMS as they will force the government to procure it on MSP of ₹1,975. He alleged that SMS are being sent to farmers whose crop is not ready for harvest.After high drama of hours, Karnal additional deputy commissioner Veena Hooda reached the mandi. She told the farmers that she will take up the matter with higher authorities to sort the issue with the help of commission agents.However, officials said SMS are being sent to farmers as harvesting is yet to pick pace and the moisture content in wheat is also high right now.But harvesting will gain pace in next one week and farmers, who could not register themselves on the ‘Meri Fasal Mera Byora’ portal will be given another opportunity to get themselves registered as the portal will reopen on April 5 and 6.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/karnal-farmers-protest-delay-in-wheat-procurement-due-to-schedule-101617391504905.html
03-04-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab sees sudden rise in Covaxin demand||With the Covid-19 vaccination drive picking pace in Punjab, after the inclusion of the 45-plus age group in the vaccination ambit, demand for the indigenously developed Covaxin has suddenly gone up, after initial hesitancy.Even though the Oxford-backed Covishield vaccine remains the main vaccine being administered throughout the state, with 9 lakh doses already being given to people of various categories, there has been a rise in the number of persons visiting sites where Covaxin shots are being administered. Senior health officials say the demand for Bharat Biotech’s vaccine is coming from health workers, especially doctors, who are opting for Covaxin because of its high efficacy in fighting the virus. “Covaxin has an efficacy of 80% against Covishield’s 70%. Those who are aware of the efficacy are visiting Covaxin sites. With more literature about the vaccine coming to the market, the vaccine’s popularity has increased in the last few days,” said Punjab’s nodal officer for Covid-19, Dr Rajesh Bhaskar. Punjab had started giving Covaxin doses from March and so far, 90,000 doses have been administered across the state and interestingly, half of it, nearly 45, 000 doses, were administered in the last one week alone. “We are getting reports from our field staff that more people are asking for Covaxin. At present, there are five to six session sites for the vaccine in every district. We are increasing the session sites from next week in view of its increasing demand,” said the nodal officer. A medical officer involved in vaccination in Patiala said, “Earlier, only one session site in the city was administering Covaxin and that too was witnessing a low turnout as compared to Covishield sites, due to initial hesitancy. But now, this site is witnessing a huge rush.” Indian Medical Association (IMA)’s Punjab chapter president, Dr Navjot Dahiya, also said the demand for Covaxin has increased. “Even as most of the private hospitals are giving Covishield, we are getting more queries now regarding the availability of Covaxin. Earlier, people had doubts about this vaccine,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-sees-sudden-rise-in-covaxin-demand-101617391446878.html

03-04-2021||Mumbai||Antilia security scare: Vaze’s ex-colleagues, south Mumbai club owner quizzed||The National Investigation Agency (NIA), which is probing the Antilia security scare case and the related murder of Thane trader Mansukh Hiran, questioned prime suspect Sachin Vaze’s former colleagues, including crime branch officer Prakash Ovhal, who reportedly purchased a Mitsubishi Outlander from the suspended Mumbai Police officer. It also recorded the statement of the owner of a south Mumbai club which it had searched on the previous day.NIA questioned Riyazuddin Kazi of the crime intelligence unit, which Vaze headed till he was suspended and later arrested, and Ovhal, for around nine hours at its office on Peddar Road on Friday.

The probe team left the place after over three hours.Vaze, a suspended police official whom NIA arrested last month in connection with the case, had been recently brought by the probe agency to the Babulnath area as part of its probe, PTI reported.Another NIA team conducted searches at a flat in Mira Road area in Thane district.PTI reported that the flat was in a woman’s possession and was locked for over two weeks, and the same woman, an alleged associate of Vaze, was detained by the agency from the airport on Thursday evening. However, this was not officially confirmed by the central agency, PTI stated.NIA has arrested Vaze on March 13 for his purported role in abandoning a Mahindra Scorpio with 20 lose gelatin sticks and a threatening note near industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s residence in Mumbai.The gelatin sticks found in the vehicle near Ambani’s house had been procured by Vaze himself, NIA officials had claimed on Wednesday, PTI stated.The suspended Mumbai police officer is also suspected to be the prime accused in alleged murder of Thane auto parts dealer Mansukh Hiran, linked to the SUV. Maharashtra anti-terrorism squad (ATS), which earlier probed the murder case, has arrested former policeman Vinayak Shinde and cricket bookie murder Naresh Gor in connection with the murder.Mansukh’s body was found dumped in a creek at Reti Bunder near Mumbra on March 5, with six handkerchiefs stuffed in his mouth and face covered by a scarf. All his belongings like golden ring, chain, mobile handset, wrist watch and valet were missing.Shinde and Gor have been arrested on March 21 and are accused of aiding abetting Vaze in killing the 48-year-old trader.Parambir Singh PILThe Bombay High Court on April 5 will pronounce its order on whether a PIL filed by former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh seeking CBI probe against Maharashtra Home Minister Anil Deshmukh should be heard further.Singh’s plea alleged that Deshmukh had asked police officers, including suspended assistant police inspector Sachin Vaze who has been arrested in the case of bomb scare near industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s residence here, to collect ₹100 crore each month from bars and restaurants.The public interest litigation also alleged corruption in police transfers and postings and political interference in probes.A division bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice G S Kulkarni had on March 31 reserved its order on the issue of maintainability of the PIL (whether it should be taken up for final hearing or dismissed at the preliminary stage).The Maharashtra government’s lawyer argued that the petition was not maintainable as Singh had vested interests and the plea was a result of his transfer from the post of Mumbai police commissioner to Home Guard.The court will also give its ruling in three other petitions filed by lawyers Jayshri Patil and Ghanshyam Upadhyay and professor Mohan Bhide seeking independent probe into Singh’s allegations against Deshmukh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/antilia-security-scare-vaze-s-ex-colleagues-south-mumbai-club-owner-quizzed-101617391384307.html

03-04-2021||Gurugram||New quota law applicable from May: Dushyant Chautala||Haryana’s job reservation law which allows 75% quota in the private sector will come into force from May 1, deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala said on Friday.“The job reservation act will come into force from May 1 and with this, every three out of four new jobs created from next month will go to the local youth from the state. The law has been made after holding detailed discussions with industries,” Chautala said, adding that jobs such as that of a security guard, driver or of similar nature do not require any special skills and there was no reason why they could not be given to the locals.Last month, Haryana governor Satydeo Narain Arya gave assent to the Haryana State Employment of Local Candidates Bill, 2020, allowing 75% reservation to locals for jobs that have a salary of less than ₹50,000 per month in privately owned companies, societies, trusts, limited liability partnership firms, partnership firms situated in Haryana. The quota will apply for 10 years.The assembly had late last year passed the bill, a key poll promise made by the ruling alliance partner Jannayak Janta Party.Chautala said jobs for which the required skill set was not available locally would be exempted from the law. He added that the government is in talks with the industry ahead of the implementation of the act. “We have also sought written suggestions from entrepreneurs,” he said.“No law, when enforced, is perfect but the changes that are made thereafter ensure that it serves the purpose for which it is meant. We are flexible on the matter and the concerns raised by stakeholders will be addressed,” he said.Several entrepreneurs have also made suggestions regarding technical posts in industries or private institutions in which special skills are required, the minister said. The jobs which require a specific technical skill set will be kept out of the purview of this law, he reiterated.“This law already has many provisions to ensure that the existing industry does not face any trouble in sourcing manpower,” he said.Gurgaon Industrial Association president J N Mangla said there is a strong apprehension among industrialists that the new law would impact their operations in the future. “The law needs to be reviewed and the suggestions put forth by the industry incorporated into the proposed rules. A situation should not be created where the industry feels harassed in the future,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/new-quota-law-applicable-from-may-dushyant-101617388624050.html
03-04-2021||Gurugram||Gurugram reports 398 new Covid cases on Friday||For the second consecutive day Gurugram reported its highest ever surge in Covid-19 cases this year with 398 new infections on Friday. The number of active cases went up to 2,283 and the total tally to 63,792. One death was reported on Friday, taking the toll to 366. The district administration said it would go for aggressive containment and stricter enforcement of health protocols such as wearing masks and keeping social distance.The surge has led to an increase in hospitalisation. Currently, at least 195 moderate to severely ill patients have been undergoing treatment in various private hospitals of the city, while 91.2% are home-isolated. Only five positive patients are isolated in designated Covid care centres. Gurugram now contributes to almost 21% of Haryana’s active case load, which is around 11,000. The district’s positivity rate -- the number of positive cases per 100 tests --- was 7% in the last two days, and over the last week it was almost 6.2%. According to the World Health Organization, the infection is said to be controlled in a region if its positivity rate was 5% or lower over two weeks.Other districts like Karnal and Panchkula have also been reporting surge as well; the positivity rate of the state is 4.67%. “The administration will focus on an aggressive containment strategy. Cases are being mapped geographically to identify areas and source of coronavirus infection. Secondly, an inter-disciplinary approach will be adopted where different government departments will be involved once again to handle specific Covid-19 related duties as done earlier in the district to tackle the surge,” said Yash Garg, Gurugram deputy commissioner, who will meet with officials of different government departments on April 5 to take stock of the situation. “Hospitalisation facility is being strengthened to provide timely treatment to people. There will be strict enforcement of mask challans to bring behavioural change among people. Meanwhile, health department will continue with rapid vaccination and increased testing to control the transmission,” said Garg. From March 25, the health department has been administering almost 5000 tests a day to timely trace positive cases. Haryana was categorised as one of the 11 “states of grave concern” by the union ministry of health and family welfare on Thursday. The state on March 15 had reported 440 new cases, on April 2, this was 1609. Earlier this year, when Covid-19 cases dramatically climbed up with a test positivity rate — proportion of positives out of the samples tested — of almost 22%, the Gurugram administration segregated activities like surveillance, delivery of timely test results, contact tracing, hospitalization and containment task among different government departments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gurugram-reports-398-new-covid-cases-on-friday-101617388505819.html

He said it will be the fastest route between Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International Airport and the Jewar airport coming up in Uttar Pradesh. “Both Faridabad and Gurugram are the main business and industrial centres of Haryana and, therefore, road connectivity between these two cities should certainly be better and this flyover will help (in that front by) ensuring smooth traffic,” he said. The flyover is 514 metres long, 21 metres wide and was built in 21 months at a cost of about ₹11.5 crore. Interacting with the media after the inauguration, Chautala said the Public Works Department had been given two years to complete the project.. Officials said that flyover will make the main crossing between Faridabad and Gurugram stop-free. Apart from this intersection, there are two other intersections on Gurugram-Faridabad highway, which will be revamped after holding talks with the national highway authority of India, said the deputy CM.Chautala also assured the residents of Bandhwari village that if they were willing to provide land then the state government would make efforts to develop international level sports facilities in the area. He also announced a grant of ₹21 lakh from his personal fund for the beautification of the historic chaupal of the village.Referring to the recent surge of Covid-19 cases, he asked people to wear masks whenever they ventured outside, maintain six feet distance and regularly sanitize their hands.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/chautala-inaugurates-flyover-on-gurugrgam-faridabad-road-says-will-boost-connectivity-101617388504722.html

The ban was imposed in November last year after the department found violations and commercial structures in the residential colony, which is spread over 208 acres along the Gurugram Sohna Road.Senior town planner Sanjiv Mann said the violations were found after a complaint from a colony resident.Residents and members of the Malibu RWAs Federation met Mann on Friday and said they were facing many difficulties without the permissions. “Many owners want to construct houses on plots that they had bought 15 to 20 years ago but can’t do so without permission. Even those who constructed homes cannot start living there without occupation certificates,” said Niranjan Yadav, chairperson of the federation. He said that residents who had no legal issues should be allowed the necessary permissions. On the violations, Yadav said action should be taken against individuals who have committed violations instead of issuing a ban. “This matter has been discussed at the headquarter level and the issue pertaining to occupation certificates and completion would be resolved by April 15,” said Mann. In another development, an enforcement team led by district town planner RS Bhath on Friday sealed six shops constructed on MCG land in village Jharsa amidst stiff resistance by locals. Bhath said that these shops had no permission. “All such structures built on government plots illegally will be sealed and plots cleared of encroachment,” he said. The enforcement team also sealed several shops in a mall on Golf Course road for having built illegal mezzanine floors. “We are acting swiftly on complaints lodged by residents and if anyone has any issue then they can approach the department online or through phone,” said Ashish Sharma, assistant town planner, enforcement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/dtcp-to-resolve-issue-of-oc-completion-certificates-in-malibu-towne-by-april-15-101617388505249.html

No one was injured in the incident but environment activists say that it hurt the Aravallis.Sohna Municipal Council executive officer Sandeep Malik said, “We are investigating the potential causes of fire at the dumping site that has increased now. Fires were reported from the dumping site in the third week of March too. We are checking if anyone is intentionally setting fire, and if so, then appropriate action will be taken against them.” The council has appointed two full-time personnel to keep vigil at the dumping site. Environmentalists alleged that this dumping site on Old Alwar Road was on Aravalli forest land. Vaishali Rana, a city-based environmentalist, said, “The Aravalli forest land should be protected. Now, with these regular fires, not just the soil and underground water, but the air too is getting polluted. In March, the fire had raged for two days before the authorities took action and doused it.” Divisional forest officer of Gurugram Ranbir Singh said, “I have recently taken charge of the area and will not be able to comment (on Aravallis) without checking the details.” As per the sub-regional plan for Haryana sub-region of National Capital Region-2021, Sohna falls in category 3 for solid waste management. As per the plan, category 3 areas are estimated to generate solid waste in the range of 30 to 50 metric tonnes and it would be viable to adopt vermi-composting and other intermediate and low cost biotechnologies to effectively dispose waste in such areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/third-fire-reported-from-sohna-waste-dumping-site-on-aravalli-land-in-two-weeks-101617388504126.html

Several vehicles were damaged in the incident and one volunteer sustained injuries but Tikait managed to escape without any physical trauma. An FIR was registered in the case in Rajasthan and the police are working the case, the spokesperson said. Following the incident, Tikait supporters in several states protested at several locations, including Chilla border, Ghazipur, Singhu borders, etc. Traffic was blocked on the Delhi-Meerut Expressway for over two hours late Friday.In Noida, the protestors blocked traffic at the Chilla border around 8 pm. Appeals from Tikait finally had the protestors clear the roads and they left the area around 9pm. “The protest caused traffic snarls from the border to ahead of the Dalit Prerna Sthal. We diverted movement from the Sthal towards the Delhi-Noida-Direct (DND) loop completely by passing Chilla and the loop opening towards Chilla was closed. Delhi police was also turning the traffic back around,” said deputy commissioner of police, traffic, Ganesh Saha.Traffic police immediately shared updates with the public, urging them to use alternate routes of DND and Kalindi Kunj and the traffic begun to clear out by 9.30 pm.Noida police officials said that they are prepared to handle the situation in case protests continue.“The protestors blocked the traffic for a while before clearing out. Our teams are on alert,” said additional deputy commissioner of police, zone 1, Kumar Rannvijay Singh.Police said that chances of the protestors returning are minimal but teams will remain vigilant just in case.The border had earlier remained closed from December 1 to January 27 during the farmer protest against new farm laws of the central government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/farmers-protest-at-chilla-leads-to-traffic-snarl-101617388266027.html
03-04-2021||Noida||Phase 4 of DME to drive CO2 emission away from Delhi-Meerut Road||Ghaziabad: The phase 4 of the Delhi Meerut Expressway (DME) that opened to the public for the first time on Thursday will reduce the burden on the existing Delhi-Meerut Road (erstwhile NH-58) --- a route most commuters take to travel to Meerut. Officials of the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) said diverting vehicles to phase 4 of the DME will help reduce emission of about 120,000kg of carbon dioxide (CO2) per day. According to officials, an estimated 120,000 passenger car units (PCU) take the Delhi-Meerut Road stretching from UP Gate to Partapur in Meerut for about 50km on a daily basis. Officials of the public works department (PWD) said it is estimated that opening phase 4 of the DME will help shift 40% of the vehicles from the Delhi Meerut Road.  “We expect about 40,000 to 45,000 vehicles to get diverted to DME and a majority of long-distance travellers moving to Uttarakhand and western UP will start using the expressway. Hence, the Delhi-Meerut Road will get decongested. About 40kms of the road falls under the jurisdiction of Ghaziabad district,” said Manish Verma, executive engineer of Uttar Pradesh PWD. The Delhi-Meerut Road passes through city areas, besides towns like Muradnagar and Modinagar in Ghaziabad. The DME, on the other hand, is a six-lane access-controlled expressway which spans about 32km from Dasna to Partapur in Meerut where the Delhi Meerut Road ends. “As per our calculations, diverting the vehicles to the DME will help reduce emission of about 120,000kg of CO2 per day. The phase 4 of the DME is expected to cater to around 50,000 to 60,000 PCUs. A majority of the vehicles will be diverted from the Delhi-Meerut Road,” said Mudit Garg, project director of NHAI. The highways authority is also planning to plant about 50,000 trees at the DME. “The DME is being developed as a greenfield expressway. We will plant 10,000 more trees against the previous target of 40,000. The plantation work is going on and will be completed before the beginning of monsoon,” added Garg. Residents said the DME will also fuel the local economy, besides reducing the pollution levels. “Previously, the air pollution levels would shoot up significantly as vehicles often got stuck in traffic jams on the Delhi Meerut Road. The traffic movement is also slow due to construction of the regional rapid transit system (RRTS). With the opening of the DME, commuters can easily bypass Ghaziabad city and move to Meerut. Once the RRTS project is complete, pollution will further decrease,” said S K Maheshwari, a resident of Surya Nagar. Ghaziabad is one of the 17 non-attainment cities in Uttar Pradesh having high pollution levels. Officials from the UP Pollution Control Board said opening the expressway will ensure seamless connectivity, which in turn will help reduce pollution levels. “We hope our monitoring stations at Indirapuram and Vasundhara show a decline in pollution levels once the DME gets fully operational. The monitoring station at Sanjay Nagar is also likely to show a decline in pollution levels as it is near to Delhi Meerut Road and many vehicles will get diverted to DME. Overall, we are expecting considerable reduction in pollution levels,” said Utsav Sharma, regional officer of the UP Pollution Control Board.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/phase-4-of-dme-to-drive-co2-emission-away-from-delhi-meerut-road-101617388265331.html
03-04-2021||Noida||With cases rising, Ghaziabad and GB Nagar should test more, say experts||Ghaziabad: Even though number of coronavirus (Covid-19) disease cases is on the rise, the Ghaziabad district has been missing its daily testing target by almost half. The district presently has a target to conduct about 5400 tests per day – 3700 through rapid antigen kits and 1700 through the Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method. However, the district on an average per day, conducted an average of 2,433 tests in January, 1,971 tests in February and 2,494 tests in March, officials records reveal.“As per the target given by state officials, we need to conduct 3700 RAT and 1700 RT-PCR tests. For the last 10-12 days, we have increased testing and are meeting the RT-PCR test target and also conducting about 2,200-2,300 tests via the rapid antigen kits. There are about 25 testing teams in operation,” said an officer from the district health department, asking not to be identified.According to sources, some of the hired lab technicians, data entry operators and even vehicles which help ferry the testing teams were detached due to the closing of the fiscal, which ended March 31, adding that this has also affected the overall testing. When asked about the issue, district magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey denied any shortage of resources. “There is no shortage of any resources and we are scaling up testing to the optimum level. If there are any issues, we will get them sorted out. Other than that, we are meeting our RT-PCR test target and also focusing on rapid antigen tests,” the DM said.According to official records of the health department, the Ghaziabad district in March saw about 565 new cases, with 90 from the Carte segment comprising localities like Shashtri Nagar, while 86 cases came from residential segments of Raj Nagar, 51 from Vaishali, 29 from Vausndhara and 63 from Karhera II, which also includes Indirapuram.Noida says increasing testing, tracingMeanwhile, officials of the Gautam Budh Nagar administration said they are ramping up testing and taking up tracing, testing and treatment to control the spread of the disease.“We have increased our daily testing and at present are conducting about 3,700-4,000 tests per day. About half of these are RT-PCR tests. Our teams are ensuring we conduct daily testing of about 4,000 and if need be, we will also increase daily testing. For past two days, the fresh Covid-19 cases have been on the higher side,” said Suhas LY, district magistrate of GB Nagar. According to the state control room figures of April 2, 73 new cases emerged in Ghaziabad and 70 in nearby Gautam Budh Nagar district. The Ghaziabad district has 355 active cases while GB Nagar has 434. “In present times, there is a need to increase daily testing and it should be about 10,000 per day. This is needed as more cases are emerging and authorities need to contain them. Aggressive testing will trace cases which can further be isolated for prevention of spread of the disease. This should be followed by extensive contact tracing to further control spread of the Covid-19,” said Dr Ashish Agarwal, president of Indian Medical Association (Ghaziabad).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/with-cases-rising-ghaziabad-and-gb-nagar-should-test-more-say-experts-101617388264726.html

03-04-2021||Noida||Teams to monitor compliance of Covid protocols in public places||With new cases coming in, the district administrations of Gautam Budh Nagar and Ghaziabad have roped in enforcement teams to ensure Covid protocols are followed in educational institutions, malls, clubs, markets and all such places where there is a large congregation of people. According to the figures provided by the state control room as on April 2, 73 fresh Covid-19 cases emerged in Ghaziabad and 70 in Gautam Budh Nagar district. While the active case tally in Ghaziabad stands at 355, there are 434 active cases in Gautam Budh Nagar. “We have deployed teams comprising senior officers, who visited several colonies and residential areas on Friday to check if Covid protocols are being followed or not. Officers from different enforcement departments, like industries and labour, have also been roped into the teams,” said Suhas LY, district magistrate of GB Nagar. He said legal action will also be taken against operators of establishments where Covid-19 protocols are being flouted. “Our teams have been directed to seal all such places where the operators of the establishments are found not stringent enough to ensure the compliance of Covid-19 safety norms. We are also ramping our vaccination drive and have set a target of vaccinating about 2 lakh beneficiaries against the target of 162,000 given for the month of April,” added Suhas. Members of the market association said many people roam around without following Covid norms. “The showroom management mostly ensure people wear masks and sanitize hands before entry. There are open spaces where people roam around freely. The administration should launch a drive to ensure strict Covid-protocol enforcement,” said SK Jain, president of Noida’s sector -18 market association. He added that there are about 1,000 small and big showrooms, shops and offices in sector 18. The district magistrate of Ghaziabad too has instructed six officers, including the sub-divisional magistrates (SDMs), to make surprise inspections in markets and other public places like malls, multiplexes and other commercial establishments. “The SDMs and officers will visit their respective areas and check if Covid-19 protocols are being followed or not. If not, they will serve notices to them for compliance. If they do not adhere to protocols, action will be initiated against them under the provisions of the Disaster Management Act and also under relevant sections of the IPC. If need be, we will also recommend cancellation of their licences,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate of Ghaziabad. The DM has also sought information on whether the Covid helpdesks are in operation, establishments are maintaining visitors’ registers, social distancing is being observed, enough provision of sanitisers and if people are being allowed entry into establishments without wearing masks. “There is hardly any social distancing in marketplaces. Many customers often come without wearing masks. Many traders have kept bundle of face masks , which they provide for free to the customers who don’t mask themselves. It is up to the administration to strictly enforce Covid protocols,” said Rajneesh Bansal, said Vyapar Mandal, chairperson of Turab Nagar Market in Ghaziabad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/teams-to-monitor-compliance-of-covid-protocols-in-public-places-101617388204695.html
03-04-2021||Noida||Winds help improve air quality in Noida||Noida: The air quality of Noida and its adjoining regions improved on Friday due to high wind speeds and better ventilation, data from the weather department revealed. Noida, Greater Noida and Ghaziabad’s air quality improved significantly on Friday since the past week, though the air quality in Ghaziabad continued to hover in the poor category. The pollution monitoring agencies stated that the air quality will oscillate between moderate to poor category for the next few days, with PM10 or larger particles being the prominent pollutant due to dust. According to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the air quality index (AQI) of Noida on Friday was 153 against 187 a day earlier.The AQI of Greater Noida was 193 against 254 on Thursday. Ghaziabad recorded an AQI of 202 on Friday against 242 on Thursday. An AQI level up to 100 is considered ‘good’, between 101 and 200 ‘moderate’, between 201 and 300 ‘poor’, between 301 and 400 ‘very poor’ and above 400 is considered ‘severe’.According to the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), the coarser dust particles will impact the air quality of the region. “Surface winds are high and blowing in the west and south-west. The AQI is likely to stay in the Moderate to Poor category for the next three days. Hence, no highly significant impact on AQI would be felt except transported coarse dust aerosols,” read a statement from SAFAR on Friday.Meanwhile, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) stated that the maximum temperatures will rise by three to four degrees over the next few days. The maximum temperature may rise to 38 degrees Celsius by April 5. On Friday, Noida recorded maximum and minimum temperatures of 33.9 degrees Celsius and 20.2 degrees Celsius respectively, against 33.6 and 21.6 degrees Celsius on Thursday. At the Safdarjung monitoring station, the weather monitoring agency which calculates the average for the National Capital Region, the maximum and minimum temperatures recorded were 34.4 degrees Celsius and 16.2 degrees Celsius respectively.“High winds helped in keeping the daytime temperature in the region under control. The wind speed for the last two days has been oscillating between 30 to 45 kmph in the west and north-west direction. Though the winds are warmer now, the speed at which the winds is blowing is preventing the temperatures from rising. The wind speeds are likely to drop from Sunday onwards. The sky will be clear leading to a gradual increase in the mercury,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head of the regional weather forecasting centre, IMD.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/winds-help-improve-air-quality-in-noida-101617388204133.html
03-04-2021||Delhi||Crowded Khan Market has little space for social distancing||On Friday, when the national capital saw over 3,500 fresh cases of Covid-19 and 14 deaths from the disease, the much-favoured Khan Market – popular for its bookstores, cafés, and luxury dining places – remained crowded till late, with people paying scant regard to social distancing protocols.Saroj Khanna, 42, a resident of south Delhi’s Chittaranjan Park, said she had not expected the market to be as crowded as it was. “My friends and acquaintances told me that proper sanitisation protocols were being followed in restaurants and the market wasn’t as crowded as other areas of the city. So I thought of visiting here to run some errands and found it crowded,” she said.Fearing that cases will increase in the coming days, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal held a meeting with health department officers on Friday afternoon, to take stock of bed availability and other hospital management measures. Kejriwal urged citizens to continue wearing masks and not let their guard down.In Khan Market, however, plenty of people were spotted not following Covid-appropriate behaviour. While sanitisers were placed outside eateries and restaurants, and service staff were stationed outside to carry out thermal checks, people were not following physical distancing while strolling through the market and many of them did not have their masks on the proper way.Prisha Seth, a class 10 student from Defence Colony, who met her friends after more than a year, said, “Our parents had to be convinced to allow us to come here. We were wearing our masks throughout and took it off only to get some group photographs.”Market association members too have geared up to enforce stricter measures to combat the new Covid wave. “We have been sharing all guidelines with shop owners and have told them not to allow more than five people in their outlets at a time. Shops follow sanitisation protocols and do not allow people without masks to enter. We are also arranging for more Covid stickers to put up in shops and ensure people stand at a distance from one another,” said Sanjiv Mehra, president of Khan Market Traders’ Association.On Friday, however, many shops were spotted flouting guidelines and allowing multiple people to enter. While eateries, restaurants, and a few high-end shops conducted temperature checks, other shopkeepers were not regulating the crowd or conducting temperature checks.A police officer on duty at the market, who asked not to be named, said, “We conduct regular checks and most of the people here wear masks properly. We ask people to maintain distance if we spot any overcrowding anywhere. There are fewer violations here than at other places. We also click photographs of people before issuing them fines if they are spotted without masks.”Sachin Narula, 41, who runs the Narula stationery which has been operational since 1958, said, “While markets are constantly being scrutinised, why are religious gatherings going unnoticed? Authorities and police conduct regular checks at Khan Market and issue fines to protocol violators. We all have to ensure that these rules are implemented stringently because we cannot have another lockdown.”Dr Rajesh Chawla, senior consultant of pulmonology at Indraprastha Apollo Hospitals, said, “The number of cases is on the rise and it will continue to increase this month. This is mainly due to the pandemic fatigue; people are not wearing masks in public, social distancing is not being maintained, and many who have stayed at home until now have started coming out, once the cases went down. All these added to the current spurt in cases.”On Friday, Delhi Police across the city issued 1,203 fines for not wearing masks. Police said they have stepped up checks and enforcement across the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/crowded-khan-market-has-little-space-for-social-distancing-101617388145259.html
03-04-2021||Delhi||Smooth ride from Delhi to Meerut on fully opened expressway||A day after phases 2 and 4 of Delhi-Meerut-Expressway (DME) was formally opened to public, HT on Friday travelled on the stretch and found that travel time to Meerut had reduced significantly, even as authorities were busy ironing out some last-minute issues regarding signage and jaywalking.The expressway was conceived to cut travel time between Delhi and Meerut to 45 minutes from the present almost two hours and a half hours.Other than for those going to Meerut, the opening of the expressway has also come as a relief to travellers headed to destinations such as Dehradun, Haridwar, Rishikesh, and also to western UP cities of Muzaffarnagar and Saharanpur.On Friday, HT got on to the newly opened expressway from near Akshardham and experienced a smooth ride to Partapur in Meerut that was completed in 46 minutes -- earlier, the same journey would have taken 2.5 hours at the minimum.At certain points on the stretch, personnel from the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) were seen completing minor works such as fixing cables, putting up CCTV cameras, painting crash barriers, and planting saplings. Some minor problems -- of confusing signage and jaywalking -- were noticed near Vijay Nagar in Ghaziabad. The expressway’s interchange with the Eastern Peripheral Expressway (EPE) was also found blocked from all sides near Dasna.On Thursday — the day phases 2 and 4 of Delhi-Meerut-Expressway was inaugurated — roadblocks, jaywalking and traffic violations were aplenty, a spot check by HT had found.On Friday, too, in Dasna, a number of vehicles could be spotted being driven on the wrong side as motorists were clueless about which way they were supposed to go to reach Hapur and Meerut. At that location, the NHAI had installed a signboard marking out the directions for the road at-grade (going towards Hapur). But several travellers going towards Hapur failed to notice that and got on to the expressway stretch towards Meerut.“Due to the confusing signage, we entered the Meerut expressway instead of going to Moradabad via Hapur. We did not have any other option but to drive on the wrong side and return to Dasna, before switching lanes and going towards Hapur,” said motorist Nripendra Yadav.“More signage will be put up for better navigation, wherever needed. There is a restriction on the movement of two-wheelers on the expressway,” said Mudit Garg, project director, NHAI.Jaywalking was also seen at two spots near Vijay Nagar in Ghaziabad and officials said they have started fencing off a 1.5km area on each side of the expressway up to a height of about five feet.The 82km expressway is divided into four phases — Sarai Kale Khan to UP Gate, UP Gate to Dasna, Dasna to Hapur, and Dasna to Meerut. Phases two and four were opened on April 1, while phase one and three were inaugurated in May 2018 and September 2019, respectively.The DME comprises 14 lanes, with the three inner lanes on each side serving as a dedicated expressway to Meerut. The outer lanes, four on each side, will serve as a highway.With the opening of the DME, officials estimate that at least 60,000 passenger car units (PCUs) each day will be able to completely bypass Ghaziabad, Muradnagar, Modinagar and connect to Partapur bypass in Meerut directly.“The Delhi-Meerut Expressway has come as a huge relief to us. For over a decade, travellers had a tough time going to Meerut via NH-58. Even the erstwhile NH-24 (now part of DME and NH-9) was just a four-lane highway and commuters travelling to Delhi had to face regular jams there,” said SK Maheshwari, resident of Surya Nagar in Ghaziabad.Commuters travelling from Delhi to Meerut on the DME will have seven entry/exit points to move into or out of the expressway lanes. The speed limit on the DME has been fixed at 100kmph in the jurisdiction of Uttar Pradesh, while it is 70kmph in Delhi.“The toll collection on DME is yet to commence but we are conducting trials. It is likely to start once a notification on toll rates is issued. The rates are expected to be in the range of ₹1.55 to ₹2.15 per kilometre of distance travelled,” said Garg.NHAI Officials said for passenger safety, they have also provided emergency call systems every 2km distance on the expressway and have also deployed a mechanical road sweeping machine, ambulance, tow van, and highway patrol van on all four phases.In the future, commuters on DME will also be able to connect to the proposed Ganga Expressway project, which will connect Meerut with Prayagraj.“The connectivity will be given to Ganga Expressway about 8km before the DME’s Kashi toll in Meerut. The 14km link is proposed to be completed in two years,” Garg further said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/smooth-ride-from-delhi-to-meerut-on-fully-opened-expressway-but-minor-glitches-remain-101617388144088.html
03-04-2021||Delhi||New liquor policy targets proxy ownership of vends||Several individuals and groups in Delhi own multiple liquor retail licences but list them under different names and addresses, official records reviewed by HT show, highlighting a clear flouting of rules, proxy ownership and cartelisation.Under the Capital’s current 2010 excise policy, a retail licensee is prohibited from opening more than one liquor shop. If a licensee flouts ownership rules, their license is liable for cancellation.But official records show private vends are controlled only by a few individuals or groups, with some owning more than 20 shops across the city. The excise license name for each liquor shop in Delhi is different. Many of them list a private company, and others different individuals.“The problem right now goes beyond just the issue of proxy ownership. It has rather evolved into cartelisation with a few retailers even getting into manufacturing cheaper variants. It negatively affects the customer’s experience as many of the renowned and top-selling labels remain ostensibly out of stock in the shelves of Delhi’s shops,” said a senior government official on condition of anonymity.For example, the records show that one individual owns 30 retail liquor licences but lists them under different names, ranging from firms dealing in investment, insurance, communication, steel, fabric, automobile, travel, appliance, furnishings, export and wires. The addresses range from northwest Delhi, Shahdara, Vasant Kunj, Inderlok, Rohini, Seelampur and Saket.Currently retail liquor license are given simply through an application process, and pays ₹8 lakh. But experts say the process is opaque, and the same individuals own multiple shops, hold vend licences and manufacturing deals, making it difficult for the government to crack down on cartels pushing particular brands or suppressing revenue.“This happened through proxy ownership. It’s true that neither the existing rules nor the proposed one has provision to target proxy ownership. We will look into this and try to make the proposed rules more stringent,” said the official quoted above.The city government says that recommendations made by a group of ministers, made public last month, is aimed at doing away with this opaque process of allotting licences and make payments upfront. The recommendations are yet to be compiled into a draft policy or sent to the lieutenant governor.The new proposed policy divides Delhi’s liquor retail trade in 32 zones — including the airport and an NDMC zone — where the existing 849 vends will be redistributed equitably. It intends to end the system of collecting license fees separately for each store and instead plans to collect an upfront license fee on the basis of the 32 new zones created. Each zone will have at least 27 liquor vends - all of which will go to one successful bidder.“To prevent cartelisation and market capture, no entity will be allocated more than two zones. Also, no manufacturer will be allowed to own retail vends. This will curb the creation of syndicates which leads to overcharging and brand pushing,” a second government official said.But some of the vendors who own multiple shops said the new policy will not resolve the problem.“We agree that the new rules will ensure quality and premium liquor is made available to the people of Delhi in abundance. But, in Delhi we have a lot of consumers who do not continuously stock liquor from Haryana which has cheaper rates. Since that category of consumers form a large chunk, owners of several zones may mutually decide to keep prices of certain bottles high from time to time. In the end, they will recover the high license fee from the consumers only,” said the vendor who owns 30 stores under different names and addresses.Prashant Arora, a liquor trader in the city, said the new proposed policy will not end proxy ownership or cartelisation, but will merely change the set of people indulging in it. “Firstly, we need to understand that the Delhi government’s proposal will help bring only the biggest market players of the industry to the city. This is because they have kept the EMD [earnest money deposit ] as high as ₹30 crore which will be in addition to the bid price for the zone, whereas, at present, the license fee for a private liquor shop is ₹8 lakh only,” he said.“Secondly, the suggested rules have the scope of taking cartelisation and proxy ownership to new heights. For instance, my company won the bid for two zones which means I already have 54 vends with me. Now, I can associate or partner with another company to make it win the bids for other zones as well. So, what is allegedly happening now will happen then also, but in a much bigger and sophisticated way,” said Arora.Delhi government rejected the charges and said the new proposed policy would usher in transparency. “The plan is to end the system of fixing the maximum retail price (MRP) of alcohol, while leaving it to market forces, and allow retailers and wholesalers to offer discounts on the sale of liquor in the city - something which was never allowed in Delhi but is permitted in the neighbouring city of Gurugram,” said the first official quoted above.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/new-liquor-policy-targets-proxy-ownership-of-vends-101617388084080.html
03-04-2021||Delhi||Govt plans to open vaccination points in schools, community centres to ramp up coverage||To ramp up the Covid-19 vaccination drive in the national capital and to cover more people, the Delhi government has asked districts to identify more locations for vaccination sites. The district administrations have proposed to open new sites at community centres, government schools and offices, according to a senior revenue department official.The inoculation drive was opened up to all above the age of 45 on April 1. There are nearly 45 lakh people between the ages of 45 and 59 years living in Delhi, according to health minister Satyendar Jain. The government has set a target of 40 days to immunise them all, necessitating the expansion of infrastructure. There are nearly 600 vaccination sites in Delhi hospitals and dispensaries currently. Initially, when the vaccination drive had started in January, the government was planning to set up at least 1,000 vaccination centres in a phased manner. Officials said they are yet to take a call on how many new ones will be set up in community centres and schools, among others.At least 1.1 million people in Delhi have received the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine since the drive began on January 16, including those above the age of 60 years and those above 45 with 20 specified comorbidities.Currently, Delhi is vaccinating about 30,000 people, on average, daily. But with cases rising once again, officials said there is a need to cover as many people as possible in each age segment in the shortest possible time. On Friday, Delhi reported 3,594 fresh cases of Covid-19 and 14 deaths, as per the state health bulletin.The Delhi government has also ordered all vaccination centres in Delhi – both government and private – to remain open on all days, including Sundays and gazetted holidays, in pursuance to a directive from the Centre.A detailed proposal with information on cold chain linkages, available manpower and nearby hospitals -- for treating anyone who suffers an adverse event -- will be sent to the health department. The matter was discussed in a meeting of the district officials on Wednesday.“So far, Delhi was immunising people in hospitals and dispensaries. However, to increase the pace of vaccination, there is a need to increase the number of inoculation centres and bring them closer to the people. This is the reason the district officials have been asked to identify community centres and schools that have appropriate space and linkages. Once that is done, immunisation can start at these locations after the health department is satisfied with the facilities,” said a senior official from Delhi’s health department, on condition of anonymity.There will be no need to seek approval from the Centre for setting up the new centres. “The Central government guidelines on vaccination already allow immunisation in spaces such as community centres and schools; no additional permission would be needed,” the official said.As per the guidelines of the Union health ministry, any vaccination site should have three rooms – waiting room, vaccination room and observation room. The vaccination room must have vaccine carriers or ice packs to store vaccines at 2 to 8 degrees Celsius, hand sanitisers and masks, vaccine vial opener, anaphylaxis kit, and appropriate bags and containers for disposing biomedical waste. Both the waiting and observation rooms must have adequate seating area to ensure social distancing.“We have started the survey to identify such facilities and will complete this in a day or two. In areas where there are no government dispensaries, we are looking at community centres or government schools and office. The sites are being identified as per the criteria set by the central government, which mandates that the facility should have three rooms. We are also looking at its proximity to the cold chain points in our districts,” said a district magistrate, who asked not to be named.District officials say one of the main challenges before them is to ensure vaccination of people living in unauthorised colonies and slums. Districts such as Shahdara, north-east, north-west, south, and east have a large number of unauthorised colonies and slums. Officials said these are densely populated areas and, in a majority of cases, don’t have government-run medical facilities nearby.“The idea is to increase the base of vaccination in these uncharted areas. We want people to walk up to the vaccination centre, but for that we need to provide facilities near their areas of residence,” said a subdivisional magistrate, also on condition of anonymity.The central Delhi district has the densely populated Walled City area where officials are looking at government schools and offices to be used as vaccination centres.Officials at the central district said they are currently organising registration camps and are also providing vans to take people to government-run facilities for vaccination. “With more centres opening in the area, it will be easier to get more people to the centre. Moreover, new centres are needed to cater to the increase in load as now anyone over the age of 45 is allowed to get vaccinated,” said a senior Central district official, asking not to be named.“In addition to the government creating capacity for vaccination, it is important to address vaccine hesitancy among people, due to all the wrong messages that are going around on social media. Then, there are reports of adverse events such as clotting happening with the AstraZeneca vaccine, whose Indian variant Covishield is being administered to most people. When it comes to taking the shot, people are perturbed and scared by such news,” said Dr Rajesh Chawla, serion consultant of pulmonology at Indraprastha Apollo Hospitals.He said, “The government is currently focussing on those who are at the highest risk of dying. However, it is the younger people who are stepping out and getting the infection currently. We have to start vaccinating them too.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/govt-plans-to-open-vaccination-points-in-schools-community-centres-to-ramp-up-coverage-101617388024049.html
03-04-2021||Delhi||Family meetings cancelled at Delhi’s three prisons in view of Covid-19 spread||In the backdrop of increasing Covid-19 cases across the city, the biweekly meeting between prisoners and their families at Delhi’s three jails -- Tihar, Rohini and Mandoli -- has been suspended, effective April 5, the director general (prisons) Sandeep Goel said on Friday.With 11,994 active Covid-19 cases across the city as on Friday, and a daily positivity rate of 4.11% -- up from 0.17% only a little more than a month ago (February 16) -- the Delhi government has said the fourth wave of the infection is currently underway in the national capital.Prison authorities said they decided to suspend the family meetings to ensure that the infection is not transmitted within the prison walls. According to jail rules, prisoners are allowed to meet their family members twice a week.After remaining suspended since the start of the lockdown in March 2020, the biweekly visits were resumed in October. Families were initially allowed inside the prison complex only once a week and that too in different batches. Prison officers said it is important to suspend the meetings because unlike last year, when around 5,000 prisoners were out on Covid-19 special parole or interim bail, almost 90% of prisoners have returned to jails in February and March. Last year, as one of the first measures to decongest jails, prisoners were released on bail/parole and were directed to surrender later.“We will review the situation a fortnight from now and take a call on restoring the meetings. We are monitoring the situation,” a senior prison officer said, asking not to be named.Currently housing around 18,000 prisoners, the Tihar prison complex is the most crowded jail across the country.Goel said while family meetings have been suspended, the meeting of inmates with their legal counsels will continue, with proper Covid precautions. “Also, telephone and the facility of e-mulaqat (virtual meetings) will continue to be available to inmates to contact their families,” he said.The prisons department has also started vaccinating prisoners within the complex. At least 60 prisoners have got the jabs in the past one week.There are 10 Covid-19 positive prisoners currently. Till date, the prison department has reported two deaths from the disease.

Recently, the CM has accepted an invitation by the Mayor of London, Mr Sadiq Khan, to represent Delhi at the World Cities Cultural Forum...This year’s theme, ‘The Future of Culture’, will play a crucial role in re-imagining the culture of Delhi, especially in the wake of several devastating challenges and Covid-19 crisis faced by the people in the last one year,” said the statement.The date for this year’s annual summit is yet to be announced in the forum’s website.The statement further said: “The forum comprises 40 world cities including London, Tokyo and New York, all of which recognise the impact and importance of culture and creativity, and seek to inculcate these values in public policy and city planning. The annual summit, attended by Deputy Mayors for Culture and Heads of Culture from the member cities, is at the heart of the forum’s activity. Delhi will also be part of the World Cities Culture report, the most comprehensive global dataset on culture in cities.”The World Cities Culture report is published by the forum every three years, with data and details on innovative projects from cities across the world. The last report was published in 2018, said the forum’s website.In the statement issued on Friday, Kejriwal said the theme of the forum -- ’The Future of Culture’ -- is a topic of relevance at this challenging juncture. As people around the world struggled in isolation, it has been art and music that helped people stay connected and cope with the crisis, he said.“Creativity and sharing provided hope and strength to respond to the Covid-19 with resilience. The unfortunate circumstances of the pandemic have posed new challenges and possibilities to reimagine the modes of cultural practice. As we move towards recovery, the arts and culture will play a vital role in rebuilding lives and society,” Kejriwal said in the statement.Calling Delhi a historic capital city seeped in diverse art and heritage which his government aims to transform into an artist-friendly city, Kejriwal said, “Delhi has been at the forefront of promoting and preserving our rich culture. Our government strongly believes in the role culture plays in shaping the city and positively impacting lives. Our goal is to transform Delhi into a world leader in the field of culture.”The decision to attend the World Cities Culture Forum comes at a time when the Delhi government is drafting a cultural policy for the Capital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/cm-kejriwal-to-attend-world-cities-culture-forum-101617387724037.html

Also, at least 50 per cent of the restaurants which reopened are suffering losses. In such a situation, the decision of the administration to close the hotels and restaurants for seven days is harsh,” said Ajinkya Shinde, vice-president of the United Hospitality Association.“The hotel and restaurant operators can’t even pay their rent. In such a situation, we are appalled by the restrictions imposed in today’s (Friday’s) meeting by the government,” he said.Sudhir Mehta, president of Mahratta Chamber of Commerce Industries and Agriculture (MCCIA), said, “We are happy that there is no complete lockdown, but at the same time suspension of Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Limited (PMPML) bus service will impact the industry workers who work in multiple shifts and use the public transport facility.”“It is difficult for smaller companies that do not have the resources to organise or hire private vehicles,” he said.Fatechand Ranka, president of the Federation of Trade Association of Pune (FTAP), said, “The restrictions will impact lakhs of people. There are more than 35,000 traders in Pune on whom lakhs of people are dependent for their daily bread and butter. We request the government to reconsider this decision and allow us operate business open till 9 pm.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/hoteliers-mccia-trade-association-unhappy-with-new-restrictions-in-pune-101617381303722.html

On April 1, the ward reported 299 cases out of the 4,103 total cases that the city reported. Experts believe that the surge is among those who remained unexposed in the first wave.The wards with no Covid positive cases fall under the green zone.The ward also has maximum micro-containment zones of all the wards in the city. Currently, there are 57 micro-containment zones, including 15 buildings and 42 societies.Dr Subhash Salunkhe, advisor to the Maharashtra government on Covid-19, said, “The herd immunity factor plays an important role in such cases. The population which remained unexposed during the first wave because they followed the protocol is now being exposed faster. People have let off their guard this time.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/aundhbaner-ward-sees-rise-in-covid-cases-101617377403642.html
03-04-2021||Pune||6pm to 6am curfew in Pune from tomorrow; restaurants, malls, religious places to remain closed till April 9||Stringent restrictions will be imposed in the Pune district from Saturday (April 3) evening, as curfew will be imposed between 6pm and 6am. Also, eateries, malls, cinema halls and religious places will remain closed for the next seven days (till April 9).The administration, however, has decided against imposing a complete lockdown, similar to the last year, even as cases are rising sharply in Pune with a weekly positivity rate touching 32 per cent.Saurabh Rao, Pune divisional commissioner, announced the restrictions after a review of the situation in Pune in a meeting chaired by Ajit Pawar, deputy chief minister and Pune district guardian minister, on Friday.Although new measures have been taken, all essential services are exempted from the restrictions. Besides curfew post evening, assembly of more than four persons has been prohibited during the daytime.The administration has also suspended the public transport service run by Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Limited (PMPML) for common citizens. The intra-city buses will, however, continue to run for those engaged in essential services. The state transport bus service and inter-district travel have been allowed.The new measures will come into force from 6pm, Saturday and will be reviewed by next Friday.During the press conference, Rao said while eateries, restaurants and bars will be closed for seven days, parcel service and home delivery will be allowed. The closure order will not apply to shops selling clothes and liquor.“The situation in Pune district has been deteriorating. Until last week, Pune’s positivity rate was up to 27 per cent. But this week the positivity rate has reached 32 per cent. According to the health experts, if this situation persists, we will have 9,000 positive cases per day from the existing daily caseload of 8,000. After the discussion in the meeting with elected representatives, these decisions have been taken. We are also focusing on increasing health infrastructure by ramping up beds,” said Rao.According to new measures, the weekly markets in rural areas of the district and parts of the city have been banned while Market Yard (Agriculture Produce Market Committee) at Gultekdi will be operational under the watch of authorities to ensure norms are being followed.The swimming pools and clubhouses in societies have been asked to shut.The schools and colleges will continue to be closed till April 30. Rao, however, clarified that students of Class 12 and Class 10 are exempted from these restrictions, while competitive examination coaching classes will be allowed to operate with 50 per cent capacity. In a separate order issued by the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) all the gyms, sport complexes, swimming pools in Pune city will remain closed for next seven days. “We were eagerly waiting for the decisions. Though the official lockdown is not declared, I fear that the situation will be the same as the lockdown. The public bus transport service is closed. Roadside eatery stalls will be closed. It will surely affect our number of customers,” said Sanjeev Phadtare, secretary, Tulshibaug Traders Association.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/6pm-to-6am-curfew-in-pune-from-tomorrow-restaurants-malls-religious-places-to-remain-closed-till-april-9-101617375064750.html
03-04-2021||Pune||Mission 100 days: Pune dist administration aims to inoculate all above 18 years||After a review meeting by deputy chief minister and Pune district guardian minister Ajit Pawar with district officials, and public representatives, the administration is now preparing to vaccinate all above 18 years in the next 100 days, a senior bureaucrat said on Friday.“As per the plan, the administration will aggressively vaccinate everyone above 45 years in the first phase and then focus on all those above 18 years in Pune district,” said Pune divisional commissioner Saurabh Rao, adding there are a total of 74 lakh people to be inoculated by the government machinery in the district“The administration hopes to vaccinate all in the next 100 days,” he said. Currently, Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporations, along with Zilla Parishad, have focused on increasing sites to vaccinate all above 45 years in April and the following months those aged between 44-18 years. As part of the process, the district on Thursday saw a record number of people – over 57,000 – getting the jab. According to Rao, while the permission currently is for people above 45 years, looking at the performance of Pune district in aggressive vaccination, he is confident that others will soon get permission to get vaccinated. Rao said, “The current trend of Covid cases is likely to continue for the next four to five weeks as per health experts. Although there is no scientific evidence, it looks like if the cases continue to rise, then in the next two days, Pune might see over 9,000 new cases daily.”“We will have maximum bed availability by April 5 after acquiring beds from private hospitals. However, if cases continue to surge, then we might have to declare a few more hospitals as dedicated Covid hospitals,” he said. Rao said that the administration will start preparing to vaccinate all above 18 years, which will take about three to four months. He said, “We have about 28 lakh people in the district aged above 45 years with and without comorbidities, and so if we start vaccinating about one lakh people daily, then ideally it would take a month to vaccinate this age group.”“The district vaccinated about 57,000 people on Thursday (April 1), which we hope to take to more than 80,000 in the next two days and then take it up to one lakh beneficiaries daily. Currently, Pune logs the highest daily vaccination in the country as compared to any district. The vaccination depends on the continuous supply of doses and also on the availability of the health infrastructure,” he said.Following up on their previous proposal to vaccinate all above 18 years of age, Rao said, “We are awaiting a nod from the Centre, but on our end, we have started micro-management for the same.”Rao also said that vaccination boosts confidence among people and that it has been found that even if someone gets the infection following vaccination, the symptoms are mild and more lives could be saved.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/mission-100-days-pune-dist-administration-aims-to-inoculate-all-above-18-years-101617371643280.html

We are orienting our men for effective implementation of the restrictions on the ground,” he said.As per the established procedure, after receiving guidelines from the government, the district collector issues prohibitory orders using the Disaster Management Act, 2005 and Epidemic Diseases Prevention Act, 1897. Following this, Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) and Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) issues guidelines for the urban parts of the district and the police commissioners of respective areas bring out executive orders using Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code and other relevant sections of the acts in vogue during such period.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pune-police-to-focus-on-patrolling-nakabandi-to-avoid-crowding-101617370863202.html

"President Biden has made it clear and I've made it clear: none of the other issues we have with China -- and there are issues -- is held hostage to or is engaged in a trade for what we need to do on climate."Sino-U.S. relations have been strained in recent years by disagreements about trade, China's treatment of its Uighur minority, as well as China's actions in Taiwan and Hong Kong.China has pledged to become carbon neutral by 2060 while U.S. President Joe Biden's administration is expected to announce a new target for reducing emissions at a global climate summit on April 22.Kerry will take part in a climate dialogue for the Middle East and North Africa hosted by Abu Dhabi on Sunday. The UAE said the dialogue would focus on national and regional preparations ahead of a United Nations climate summit to be held in Glasgow in November.Kerry said the countries would discuss how to reduce a reliance on coal, as well as how to "raise ambitions" on climate change ahead of November's conference."I think the next generations are screaming at us to fulfill our promise," he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-hopeful-it-can-work-with-china-to-tackle-climate-change-says-john-kerry-101617470797285.html
03-04-2021||World||Thousands join 'Kill the Bill' rallies across UK against proposed protest law||Thousands of demonstrators joined rallies across Britain on Saturday as part of a "national weekend of action" against a proposed new law that would give police extra powers to curb protests.The Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts bill aims to toughen measures officers can take to disperse demonstrations, such as imposing time and noise limits, which campaigners and activists fear would be used to curb dissent.On Saturday, "kill the bill" marches were held in dozens of towns and cities, including London, Manchester and Bristol, supported by big campaign groups such as climate change campaigners Extinction Rebellion and the Black Lives Matter movement."(I'm here) to defend the rights of free speech, and the rights of organisations in our society," said Jeremy Corbyn, the former leader of the opposition Labour Party who was among several thousand who joined the protest in central London."These demonstrations, 50 of them today, will make a difference," he told Reuters opposite the Houses of Parliament.Since the bill was brought before parliament last month, there have been sporadic protests. In Bristol, southwest England, demonstrations have turned violent with officers and a police station bombarded with bricks and glass bottles and police vehicles set on fire.Prime Minister Boris Johnson criticised what he described as "disgraceful attacks" on officers, but protesters have accused police of using heavy-handed tactics.Days of protests by Extinction Rebellion, which paralysed parts of London in early 2019, fuelled calls from some politicians for the police to be given the tougher powers to prevent excessive disruption.Demonstrations had not been permitted while a coronavirus lockdown was in place, but restrictions were eased this week, meaning the rallies could go ahead providing they were "COVID secure".In London, police warned, "enforcement action will be taken, if needed, in the interests of public health". Some senior officers have said the "kill the bill" tag was deliberately provocative as "the bill" is a nickname in Britain for the police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thousands-join-kill-the-bill-rallies-across-uk-against-proposed-protest-law-101617470540180.html
03-04-2021||World||Noah Green, US Capitol attacker, was a supporter of ‘Nation of Islam’. Here's all you need to know||US law enforcement officials identified the suspect who attacked Capitol police officers as Noah Green, a 25-year-old who described himself as a follower of the 'Nation of Islam'. Green recently posted on his Facebook account, which has now been taken down by the social media network, that he had been unemployed and facing fear, hunger, and loss of wealth. The messages were captured by the SITE Intelligence Group, which monitors jihadist media and tracks online activity.“To be honest these past few years have been tough, and these past few months have been tougher,” he wrote. “I have been tried with some of the biggest, unimaginable tests in my life. I am currently now unemployed after I left my job partly due to afflictions, but ultimately, in search of a spiritual journey,” the post read.In another Facebook post, Green said he believed that the founder of Nation of Islam, Louis Farrakhan, was “the Messiah”. “I consider him my spiritual father. Without his guidance, his word, and his teachings that I’ve picked up on along the way, I would’ve been unable to continue,” he wrote.Anti-hate organization ADL has described Farrakhan as an anti-Semite who has been railing against Jews, white people and the LGBT community for more than 30 years. Farrakhan’s speeches draw thousands of attendees, which, according to ADL, gives him the dubious distinction of being quite possibly America’s most popular anti-Semite.Also Read | Officer killed in attack outside Capitol identified as an 18-year veteranGreen had also reportedly called the US government “#1 enemy of Black people!" in one of his Instagram posts. Facebook confirmed to Business Insider in an email statement that the social media network has removed Green’s account.“We have designated the incident under our Dangerous Individuals and Organizations policy, which means we have removed the suspect's accounts from Facebook and Instagram, and are removing any content that praises, supports, or represents the attack or the suspect," a Facebook spokesperson was quoted by the Insider as saying.According to a Washington Post report, Green blamed his former roommates and teammates of the Christopher Newport University football team for drugging him with Xanax. Green’s brother, Brendan told the Post that Noah had recently called him asking for help, saying he was “in a really bad situation and in really bad shape.”Following the deadly attack, law enforcement officials had said that the incident did not appear to be linked to terrorism. However, Ria Katz, director of SITE Intelligence Group, said that Greene's social media presence suggests he might have been very troubled, but terrorism should not be ruled out.1) Appears 25 year old #Capitol attack suspect Noah Greene (who died in hospital) was in some sort of desperation in life.

03-04-2021||World||Signs of unease emerging between China, Pakistan over future of CPEC: Report||Amid lack of progress on the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), subtle signs of unease have emerged between the two countries over the future direction and funding of mega projects, under increasing scrutiny of media and the public.According to a report published in Modern Diplomacy, the outcome of recent meetings between the two countries reveals significant scaling down of Pakistan's expectations regarding the inclusion of more projects under CPEC phase II.Fabien Baussart in an opinion piece for Modern Diplomacy said "While the country has for long portrayed USD 6.8 billion Main Line-I project to be the main artery of the Pakistan Railways and tried to convince China for financing the project, the Chinese side has tried to avoid any commitment for funding."Pakistan has unable to secure any favourable consideration including the concessionary loan at an interest rate of one per cent, said Baussart while adding that China is only willing to offer a mix of commercial and concessional loans to fund the rail project backed by suitable guarantees by Pakistan."Although it is the largest among the lot, ML-1 is not the only project facing significant delays. According to Pak CPEC Authority, so far, 17 projects worth USD 13 billion have been completed while another 21 projects having an estimated cost of USD 12 billion are under implementation," the report said.Baussart further argued that despite high publicity, hardly any Chinese investors are showing interest in setting up of units in the Special Economic Zones being established as part of industrial cooperation under CPEC.The report further said the hype created by Islamabad through projecting CPEC as a panacea for all problems is losing steam."The project not only lacks clear direction to steer through but continues to struggle due to absence of coordination among various executing agencies. The realization is gradually dawning upon various government agencies that Pakistan's economy has failed to achieve any real benefit from the CPEC," the report said.Adding to that, the Senate Special Committee on CPEC informed the upper house of parliament earlier this month that the Pakistan planning, development and special initiatives ministry does not have the capacity to coordinate and manage projects like CPEC.The committee stated in a report that the ministry clearly lacks vision and critical thinking as an institution, adding that several lapses in the project due to mismanagement and lack of strategic planning were pointed out in the last two-and-a-half years, The Express Tribune reported.In 2015, China announced an economic project in Pakistan worth USD 46 billion. With the CPEC, Beijing aims to expand its influence in Pakistan and across Central and South Asia in order to counter the influence of the United States and India.The CPEC would link Pakistan's southern Gwadar port (626 kilometres west of Karachi) in Balochistan on the Arabian Sea to China's western Xinjiang region. It also includes plans to create road, rail, and oil pipeline links to improve connectivity between China and the Middle East.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/signs-of-unease-emerging-between-china-pakistan-over-future-of-cpec-report-101617465302652.html

03-04-2021||World||Covid-19 vaccine passport efforts draw opposition from GOP lawmakers||Vaccine passports being developed to verify Covid-19 immunization status and allow inoculated people to more freely travel, shop and dine have become the latest flash point in America’s perpetual political wars, with Republicans portraying them as a heavy-handed intrusion into personal freedom and private health choices.They currently exist in only one state — a limited government partnership in New York with a private company — but that hasn’t stopped GOP lawmakers in a handful of states from rushing out legislative proposals to ban their use.Follow latest updates on Covid-19 here The argument over whether passports are a sensible response to the pandemic or governmental overreach echoes the bitter disputes over the past year about masks, shutdown orders and even the vaccines themselves.Vaccine passports are typically an app with a code that verifies whether someone has been vaccinated or recently tested negative for Covid-19. They are in use in Israel and under development in parts of Europe, seen as a way to safely help rebuild the pandemic- devastated travel industry.They are intended to allow businesses to more safely open up as the vaccine drive gains momentum, and they mirror measures already in place for schools and overseas travel that require proof of immunization against various diseases.But lawmakers around the country are already taking a stand against the idea. GOP senators in Pennsylvania are drawing up legislation that would prohibit vaccine passports, also known as health certificates or travel passes, from being used to bar people from routine activities.“We have constitutional rights and health privacy laws for a reason,” said Pennsylvania House Majority Leader Kerry Benninghoff, a Republican. “They should not cease to exist in a time of crisis. These passports may start with COVID-19, but where will they end?”Benninghoff said this week his concern was “using taxpayer money to generate a system that will now be, possibly, in the hands of mega-tech organizations who’ve already had problems with getting hacked and security issues.”A Democratic colleague, Rep. Chris Rabb of Philadelphia, sees value in vaccine passports if they are implemented carefully.“There’s a role for using technology and other means to confirm people’s statuses,” Rabb said. “But we do have concerns around privacy, surveillance and inequitable access.”Republican legislators in other states have also been drafting proposals to ban or limit them. A bill introduced in the Arkansas Legislature on Wednesday would prevent government officials from requiring vaccine passports for any reason, and would ban their use as a condition of “entry, travel, education, employment or services.”The sponsor, Republican state Sen. Trent Garner, called vaccine passports “just another example of the Biden administration using COVID-19 to put regulations or restrictions on everyday Americans.”President Joe Biden's administration has largely taken a hands-off approach on vaccine passports.At a news conference this week, Andy Slavitt, acting administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said he considered them a project for the private sector, not the government.He said the government is considering federal guidelines to steer the process surrounding vaccine passports. Among its concerns: Not everyone who would need a passport has a smartphone; passports should be free and in multiple languages; and private health information must be protected."There will be organizations that want to use these. There will be organizations that don’t want to use these,” said Dr. Brian Anderson of Mitre, which operates federally funded research centers and is part of a coalition working to develop standards for vaccine certifications to make their use easier across vendors.Anderson noted the Vaccination Credential Initiative is not making recommendations on how — or even if — organizations choose to use the certifications.In Montana, GOP lawmakers this week voted along party lines to advance a pair of bills that would ban discrimination based on vaccine status or possession of an immunity passport, and to prohibit using vaccine status or passports to obtain certain benefits and services.And a freshman Republican state lawmaker in Ohio spoke out about the concept, saying more restrictions or mandates are not the answer to every Covid-19 problem.“Ohioans are encouraged to take the COVID-19 vaccine for the health and well-being of themselves and others,” Rep. Al Cutrona said. “However, a vaccine should not be mandated or required by our government for our people to integrate back to a sense of normalcy.”Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis on Friday issued an executive order that said no governmental entity can issue a vaccine passport, and businesses in that state can't require them. He said he expected the Legislature to pass a similar law.His order said requiring "so-called Covid-19 vaccine passports for taking part in everyday life — such as attending a sporting event, patronizing a restaurant, or going to a movie theater — would create two classes of citizens.”US Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Georgia, a newly elected member who has embraced and promoted a range of far-right political positions, told her supporters on Facebook earlier this week that “something called a vaccine passport” was a form of “corporate communism” and part of a Democratic effort to control people’s lives.And a GOP lawmaker in Louisiana has teed up a bill to keep the state from including any vaccination information on the Louisiana driver’s license or to make issuance of a driver’s license subject to vaccine status.In New York, a government-sponsored vaccine passport called the Excelsior Pass is being introduced. A smartphone app, it shows whether someone has been vaccinated or recently tested negative for Covid-19.Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo touted the idea as letting an event venue usher, for example, use their own smartphone to scan a concertgoer’s code.New York officials have not released specific details about how the app will work, access someone’s vaccination or testing status or protect a user’s name, date of birth or the location where their code was scanned. The app’s privacy policy says data will be “maintained in a secure manner” and won’t be used for sales or marketing purposes or shared with a third party. But some privacy experts say the public needs more specifics to ensure its information is protected.Albert Fox Cahn, founder and executive director of the Surveillance Technology Oversight Project at the Urban Justice Center, a New York–based civil rights and privacy group, warned the Excelsior Pass creates a new layer of surveillance without sufficient details about how it collects data or protects privacy."We basically only have screenshots of the user interface and not much more,” Cahn said of Excelsior Pass.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-vaccine-passport-efforts-draw-opposition-from-gop-lawmakers-101617461948282.html
03-04-2021||World||Matt Gaetz sex probe suddenly threatens a speedy Washington rise||Compared with most congressional newbies, it didn't take Rep. Matt Gaetz long. Phone calls from the president. Rides aboard Air Force One. Hundreds of television appearances. A darling in conservative circles.Yet barely four years after arriving in Washington as a little-known Republican state legislator from Florida’s Panhandle, the 38-year-old unblushing defender of Donald Trump is facing a possible abrupt end to his once promising career because of a federal sex-trafficking investigation.The overwhelming reaction of Gaetz's GOP colleagues — a deafening silence. That reflects the resentments he's sparked during his breakneck rise as one of the party's celebrities and the challenge he faces to retain his seat.Government agents are investigating if Gaetz had sex with a 17-year-old and other underage girls and violated federal sex trafficking laws, people familiar with the probe have told the AP. No charges have been filed, and Gaetz has denied the allegations.But with new, damaging details emerging regularly, Gaetz's political arc is beginning to resemble the myth of Icarus, who plunged to earth after ignoring warnings that his waxen wings would melt if he flew too close to the sun.The coming days will test the crisis management skills of one of the most visible members of Congress' younger generation, who critics say care more about promoting their own brand than serious legislating.“They're here for notoriety and to perform to their base, and anything else that may come is secondary,” said Doug Heye, a Trump critic and former top GOP congressional aide. “And if you boo him that's great too, as long as you're watching.”David Bossie, president of Citizens United, which backs conservative causes and candidates, countered that Gaetz "has been a conservative warrior, working every day to make America great again and fight for President Trump’s agenda.”Gaetz's congressional Twitter account is topped with a photo of himself taking a selfie with Trump, apparently on Air Force One. On his personal Twitter account, Gaetz describes himself as “Florida man. Fiancé. Firebrand. America First." He became engaged at Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida in December.Gaetz is quick with a quote and looks little older than a college student. And by his own account, he's hardly led a prudish lifestyle while battling for conservative causes.In his 2020 autobiographical book, “Firebrand,” Gaetz praised Trump as someone “who doesn’t care for puritanical grandstanding or moralistic preening." He added, "If politicians’ family lives aren’t what really matter to the voters, maybe that’s a good thing. I’m a representative, not a monk.”Chris Latvala, a former GOP colleague in the Florida legislature, suggests that while there, Gaetz went too far. On Friday, Latvala revived a 2020 tweet in which he accused Gaetz of creating a “game where members of the FL House got 'points' for sleeping with aides, interns, lobbyists, and married legislators.”Latvala wrote Friday, “ I am just sorry that this guy may have victimized others, including possibly minors before others came forward to verify it.”The game was also described by two other Florida Republicans, who spoke on condition of anonymity to reveal what was a private matter. Gaetz has denied knowing about it.The son of Don Gaetz, a wealthy businessman and one-time Florida state Senate president, Matt Gaetz came to Congress after six years of building his conservative credentials in the state House with pro-gun and other legislation.Just months after Gaetz arrived in Washington in 2017, when Trump's presidency also began, special counsel Robert Mueller began investigating Russia's influence in Trump's election.Gaetz sprang into action to defend Trump, filing one resolution asserting investigative wrongdoing aimed at making Mueller resign, and essentially never stopped. His persistence was noted by Trump, who began calling the young lawmaker.The day before a House hearing on the Russia investigation in 2019, Gaetz tweeted at former Trump attorney Michael Cohen, who'd turned on Trump and was about to testify, asking, “Do your wife & father-in-law know about your girlfriends?" The House Ethics Committee formally admonished Gaetz for the tweet, which some saw as an attempt at intimidation, and he apologized.Gaetz was highly visible again months later when the House began its impeachment investigation over Trump's efforts to pressure Ukraine to provide political dirt on Democrat Joe Biden, who would eventually defeat Trump in the election.Most notably, Gaetz led a cluster of House Republicans who barged past Capitol Police officers into a secure basement meeting room where House Intelligence Committee members were questioning witnesses. They caused a delay of several hours that had little impact on the probe but garnered press attention.Gaetz was grabbing the spotlight in other ways, too. He brought a white nationalist who questioned the Holocaust as his guest to Trump's 2018 State of the Union address, later claiming ignorance of the man's views.In March 2020 as the pandemic was taking hold, Gaetz wore a gas mask on the House floor. Critics accused him of downplaying COVID-19, as Trump repeatedly did, but Gaetz asserted he was calling attention to lawmakers' vulnerability to the disease.All the while, his visibility was growing. Gaetz has made 346 weekday cable news appearances since August 2017, according to Media Matters, a liberal group that monitors conservative media activity.That makes Gaetz second in Congress only to Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, a fellow Trump ally and ubiquitous TV presence.Through it all, Gaetz has shown no hesitation to criticize fellow Republicans.In a 2020 tweet, he accused Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr, R-N.C., of “screwing all Americans" by dumping stock using insider information as the coronavirus pandemic was starting. The Justice Department investigated Burr but brought no charges.In Gaetz's book, in a first chapter called “Sex and Money,” he wrote that when he arrived in Congress, he asked current House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., for a seat on the Armed Services Committee. Gaetz wrote that “to my shock," McCarthy suggested he contribute $75,000 to the House GOP's campaign committee — a donation Gaetz wrote he actually doubled.This past January, Gaetz helped spearhead an effort to depose Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., from her post as No. 3 House GOP leader after she was among 10 Republicans to vote for Trump's second impeachment.Gaetz even traveled to a campaign event in Wyoming, where he urged voters to oppose her 2022 reelection and accused her of ignoring “the will of the people.” Days later, Cheney was reelected to her leadership post.All of that helped alienate him from many Republicans, several GOP lawmakers and aides said.Among his only defenders this week has been Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., who tweeted, “Take it from me rumors and headlines don’t equal truth." Greene has become a pariah even among some Republicans for showing support for false and violent sentiments.Having a deep well of support among colleagues can help a beleaguered lawmakers retain their seat should party leaders begin viewing them as a liability. Ominously, McCarthy has called the charges against Gaetz “serious."Gaetz has reportedly had inconclusive discussions with Newsmax, a small pro-Trump television outlet, about working for it or another network. A person close to Newsmax said Friday the network has no plans to hire him as a talent.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/matt-gaetz-sex-probe-suddenly-threatens-a-speedy-washington-rise-101617461320380.html
03-04-2021||World||Births among endangered North Atlantic right whales highest since 2015||North Atlantic right whales gave birth over the winter in greater numbers than scientists have seen since 2015, an encouraging sign for researchers who became alarmed three years ago when the critically endangered species produced no known offspring at all.Survey teams spotted 17 newborn right whale calves swimming with their mothers offshore between Florida and North Carolina from December through March. One of those calves soon died after being hit a boat, a reminder of the high death rate for right whales that experts fear is outpacing births.The overall calf count equals the combined total for the previous three years. That includes the dismal 2018 calving season, when scientists saw zero right whale births for the first time in three decades. Still, researchers say greater numbers are needed in the coming years for North Atlantic right whales to rebound from an estimated population that's dwindled to about 360.“What we are seeing is what we hope will be the beginning of an upward climb in calving that’s going to continue for the next few years,” said Clay George, a wildlife biologist who oversees right whale surveys for the Georgia Department of Natural Resources. “They need to be producing about two dozen calves per year for the population to stabilize and continue to grow again.”Right whales migrate each winter to the warmer Atlantic waters off the Southeastern U.S. to give birth. Trained spotters fly over the coastline almost daily during the calving season, scanning the water for mothers with newborns.Survey flights over Georgia and Florida ended Wednesday on the last day of March, typically the season's end. Spotters will monitor waters off the Carolinas through April 15, hoping to pick up any overlooked newborns as the whales head north to their feeding grounds.This season's calf count matches the 17 births recorded in 2015. Right whale experts consider that number fairly average, considering the record is 39 births confirmed in 2009.Scientists suspect a calving slump in recent years may have been caused by a shortage of zooplankton to feed right whales in the Gulf of Maine and the Bay of Fundy off Nova Scotia. They say the uptick in births this season could be a result of whales being healthier after shifting to waters with more abundant food sources.“It's a somewhat hopeful sign that they are starting to adjust to this new regime where females are in good enough condition to give birth,” said Philip Hamilton, a right whale researched at the New England Aquarium in Boston.Regardless, conservationists worry that right whales are dying — largely from manmade causes — at a faster rate than they can reproduce.Since 2017, scientists have confirmed 34 right whale deaths in waters of the U.S. and Canada — with the leading causes being entanglement in fishing gear and collisions with boats and ships. Considering additional whales were documented in the same period with serious injuries they were unlikely to survive, researchers fear the real death toll could be at least 49.That would exceed the 39 right whale births recorded since 2017.“If we reduced or eliminated the human-caused death rate, their birth rate would be fine,” Hamilton said. "The onus should not be on them to reproduce at a rate that can sustain the rate at which we kill them. The onus should be in us to stop killing.”The federal government is expected to finalize new rules soon aimed at decreasing the number of right whales tangled up in fishing gear used to catch lobster and crabs in the Northeast. Proposals to reduce vertical fishing lines in the water and modify seasonal restricted areas have been met with heated debate. Fishermen say the proposed rules could put them out of businesses, while conservation groups insist they aren't strict enough.The National Marine Fisheries Service received more than 170,000 public comments on the proposed rules after a report was issued Dec. 31, said agency spokeswoman Allison Garrett. She said final rules should be published this summer.Garrett said the fisheries service is also considering adjustments to federal rules that since 2008 have imposed speed limits on larger vessels in certain Atlantic waters during seasonal periods when right whales are frequently seen. An agency report in January found mariners' compliance with the speed rules have improved overall, but still lagged below 25% for large commercial vessels at four ports in the Southeast.“We’ve long known from the survival estimates that more right whales are dying than those we see,” said George, the whale survey coordinator for Georgia. “They need to be producing a lot more calves. But the big issue is we’ve got to significantly reduce the number than are being entangled in fishing ropes and struck by boats."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/births-among-endangered-north-atlantic-right-whales-highest-since-2015-101617458002228.html
03-04-2021||World||Amazon acknowledges issue of drivers urinating in bottles, apologises to US lawmaker for scoring 'own goal'||Amazon.com Inc has apologized to U.S. Representative Mark Pocan, admitting to scoring an "own goal" in its initial denial of his suggestion that its drivers were sometimes forced to urinate in bottles during their delivery rounds."We know that drivers can and do have trouble finding restrooms because of traffic or sometimes rural routes, and this has been especially the case during Covid when many public restrooms have been closed," the company said in a blog post.Its admission came a week after the Democrat criticised Amazon's working conditions, saying in a tweet: "Paying workers $15/hr doesn't make you a 'progressive workplace' when you union-bust & make workers urinate in water bottles."Amazon initially issued a denial, saying in a tweet: "You don't really believe the peeing in bottles thing, do you? If that were true, nobody would work for us." But it subsequently walked back those comments.1/2 You don’t really believe the peeing in bottles thing, do you? If that were true, nobody would work for us. The truth is that we have over a million incredible employees around the world who are proud of what they do, and have great wages and health care from day one."This was an own goal, we're unhappy about it, and we owe an apology to Representative Pocan," Amazon said in its blog post, adding that its previous response only referred to staff at its warehouses or fulfillment centers.The company said the issue was industry-wide and it would look for solutions, without specifying what these might be. Amazon's apology comes at a time when workers at an Alabama warehouse are waiting for a vote count that could result in the online retailer's first unionized facility in the United States and mark a watershed moment for organized labor.Amazon has long discouraged attempts among its more than 800,000 U.S. employees to organize. Allegations by many workers of a grueling or unsafe workplace have turned unionizing the company into a key goal for the U.S. labor movement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/amazon-admits-issue-of-drivers-urinating-in-bottles-apologises-to-us-lawmaker-101617456327267.html
03-04-2021||World||Aiming big, Biden is looking to restore faith in government||As President Joe Biden preaches patience but acts with urgency, his vision of the powers of the Oval Office is quickly taking shape, modelled after Democratic predecessors who dramatically expanded the reach of government to confront generational crises.In a recent meeting with historians and in private conversations with advisers, Biden looked to the examples set by Presidents Franklin D Roosevelt and Lyndon Johnson as he aims to use the levers of executive authority to create opportunities and break down barriers.Unlike Roosevelt and Johnson, who enjoyed formidable Democratic majorities in Congress, Biden has had to operate with a no-margin-for-error edge in fiercely partisan Washington.Born soon after Roosevelt's New Deal and having first run for office in the shadow of Johnson's Great Society, Biden has long believed in government as an instrument for good. Now, with the Covid-19 public health pandemic and the economic carnage it wrought, that philosophy is being put to a fundamental test and Biden's place in history is in the balance.He has chosen momentous action over incremental, willing to cast aside visions of a bipartisan Washington in favour of tangible results Biden insists are resonating with Republican voters, if not their elected officials.“The president was clear about the crisis of democracy and aware of the factors and forces that may try to undermine the American experiment if we are not careful to protect it,” said historian Michael Eric Dyson, who attended the recent session.“There was no question that the president was concerned about how we treat our fellow citizens and is keenly aware that the moral trajectory of the United States has made a difference in both domestic and foreign policy.”Over his first two months in office, Biden has signed into law USD 1.9 trillion Covid-19 relief bill and, this past week, proposed an even larger USD 2.3 trillion infrastructure and tax plan that is the first installment of a two-part legislative package meant to reshape the American economy.His team's guiding principle is that the United States must push past the pandemic and the Jan. 6 insurrection at the Capitol to rebuild the economy in an equitable way that shows the nation can still make good for its citizens as it faces a threat from autocratic states, including China, for global economic supremacy.“There's a lot of autocrats in the world who think the reason why they're going to win is democracies can't reach consensus any longer; autocracies do,” Biden said Wednesday when he announced his infrastructure plan in Pittsburgh.“That's what competition between America and China and the rest of the world is all about. It's a basic question: Can democracies still deliver for their people? Can they get a majority?” Biden continued. “I believe we can. I believe we must.”The president has urged action despite a very narrow Democratic majority in the House and a 50-50 split in the Senate that requires Vice President Kamala Harris to break ties. No Republican lawmakers voted for the Covid-19 relief bill, although it was popular among voters of both parties.No Republicans appear likely to support the infrastructure plan.To this point, the White House has refused to entertain the debate that often bedevils presidents who know their party traditionally loses seats in their first midterm elections: play it safe to try to preserve power or go big?Biden's bet for the latter is clear, banking that voters will ignore big price tags and reward tangible results on vaccines, roads, broadband and more while forcing Republicans to defend a tax structure that benefits ultra-wealthy companies.Even so, the progressive forces in the Democratic Party that helped elect Biden are already pushing the president to go bigger still, demanding immediate action on gun control, immigration and climate change.Biden is asking for patience, keenly aware of the arithmetic of the Senate and the headwinds he'll face on some issues. But the 78-year-old president also has pressed for urgency, knowing that his party's hold on Congress is tenuous and believing that now is the moment to restore a wary public's faith in government.This past week, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., framed Biden's gamble as “in the tradition of America -- to think big.”Biden has indeed looked to history for guidance.A month ago, he gathered more than a half-dozen historians in the East Room of the White House and listened to each speak about what made previous presidents successful and what lessons could be drawn for the present.For two hours, Biden asked questions, attendees said, and reflected his own political role models.“This is a president who obviously loves history and has used history all of his life and his career," said presidential historian Michael Beschloss. “He knows all about 1933 and 1965. We have seen evidence of that his whole career."Biden's infrastructure package would go well beyond the usual commitments to roads and bridges to touch almost every part of the country. It's a down payment on combating climate change, a chance to take on racial inequities, an expansion of broadband, an investment in manufacturing and a reorienting of corporate taxes to pay for everything.The opposition will be fierce. Republicans have already balked at its scope and the taxes that would finance it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/aiming-big-biden-is-looking-to-restore-faith-in-government-101617456400696.html
03-04-2021||World||Deadly breach could delay decisions about US Capitol fencing||The deadly breach of the Capitol’s perimeter could delay the gradual reopening of the building’s grounds to the public just as lawmakers were eyeing a return to more normal security measures following the Jan. 6 insurrection.Capitol Police officer William “Billy” Evans, an 18-year veteran of the force, was killed Friday when a man rammed his car into a barrier outside the Senate side of the building. The driver, identified as 25-year-old Noah Green, was shot and killed after he got out of his car and lunged at police with a knife.Their deaths came less than two weeks after the Capitol Police removed an outer fence that had cut off a wide swath of the area to cars and pedestrians, in an effort to secure the complex after thousands of then-President Donald Trump’s supporters had marched on the building Jan. 6, as Congress was certifying Joe Biden's election victory. About 800 of those loyalists broke inside the Capitol, and siege lead to the deaths of five people, including a Capitol Police officer.Police have left an inner fencing perimeter intact. The tall, dark fencing — parts of it covered in razor wire until recently -- had blocked major arteries that cross the city and was a stark symbol of the fear many in the Capitol felt after the violent mob laid siege two month ago. Lawmakers said the seat of American democracy was meant to be open to the people, even if there was always going to be a threat.But after Friday’s attack, lawmakers said they needed to procced with caution.“It’s an eyesore, it sucks,” Democratic Rep. Tim Ryan of Ohio, chairman of a House spending committee that oversees security and the Capitol, said about the fencing in the hours after the two deaths. “Nobody wants that there. But the question is, is the environment safe enough to be able to take it down? In the meantime, maybe that fence can prevent some of these things from happening.”Ryan stressed that no decisions had been made, and that lawmakers would be “reviewing everything.” His committee and others are looking at not only the fence but at the staffing, structure, and intelligence capabilities of the Capitol Police.“The scab got ripped off again here today,” Ryan said. “So we've got to figure this out.”The breach happened inside the perimeter. The driver slipped through a gate that had opened to allow traffic in and out of the Capitol and rammed a barrier that had protected the building long before Jan. 6. There was no evidence that Green's actions were in any way related to the insurrection.Still, it was a reminder that there is always a target on one of the country's most visible public buildings, especially after the public attention over the broad security failures three months ago.“This may just cause everybody to pump the brakes a bit on taking the fence down entirely because of the sense of security that it provides us,” said Democratic Rep. Jennifer Wexton of Virginia, another member of the spending panel that oversees the legislative branch.As a lawmaker who represents the suburbs of Washington, Wexton said she wants to see the Capitol open again to visitors. While the indoor parts of the building have been closed for the last year because of the coronavirus pandemic, the plazas, roads and sidewalks that surround the Capitol were only closed after the riot, keeping the public completely away from the area.“I would like to see it come down at the earliest possible moment,” Wexton said of the fencing.While lawmakers were initially supportive of the fencing to secure the area, and the thousands of National Guard troops sent to the Capitol to back up the overwhelmed police force, they soon said they were ready for a drawdown.“I think we’ve overdone it,” said Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky last month. “It looks terrible to have the beacon of our democracy surrounded by razor wire and National Guard troops.“Missouri Sen. Roy Blunt, the top Republican on the Senate Rules and Administration Committee, said the fencing should come down because the next security problem is “highly unlikely to be a carbon copy of the last problem.” Republican Rep. Carlos Gimenez of Florida told Fox News he believed Democrats were keeping the fence up for “political reasons."But abhorrence of the fence is a rare issue on which the two parties can agree.“It’s just ghastly, it’s an embarrassment,” said Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin, the second-ranking Democrat. “If there’s a better way to protect us, I want to see it. I want to work to get it.”Security officials, though, say that the Capitol cannot return to what had been status quo.In February, acting Capitol Police Chief Yogananda Pittman told lawmakers that “the Capitol’s security infrastructure must change.”A security review requested by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., in the aftermath of the riot and conducted by a task force recommended eventually replacing the barrier with mobile fencing and “an integrated, retractable fencing system” that could be used as needed. It is unclear whether such an expensive proposal could win approval from Congress.Ryan said his committee was doing extensive research and had a recent call with Israeli security officials to learn how they keep their government secure.“We’ve got to figure out what the sweet spot is with the security,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/deadly-breach-could-delay-decisions-about-us-capitol-fencing-101617455161648.html

The risk associated with this type of blood clot is “very small,” it added.“The benefits of Covid-19 vaccine AstraZeneca in preventing Covid-19 infection and its complications continue to outweigh any risks and the public should continue to get their vaccine when invited to do so,” said Dr. June Raine, the agency’s chief executive.Concerns over the AstraZeneca vaccine has already prompted some countries including Canada, France, Germany and the Netherlands to restrict its use to older people. The U.K., which has rolled out coronavirus vaccines faster than other European nations, is particularly reliant on the AstraZeneca vaccine, which was developed by scientists at the University of Oxford.Read | AstraZeneca Covid shot: Are women recipients more impacted by blood clot events?MHRA's view about the relative benefits of the vaccine is shared by the European Medicines Agency. It has said a causal link between unusual blood clots in people who have had the vaccine is “not proven, but is possible," and that the benefits of the vaccine outweigh the risks of side effects. The World Health Organization has also urged countries to continue using the jab.Adam Finn, a professor of pediatrics at the University of Bristol, said the “extreme rarity” of the blood-clotting events in the context of the millions of jabs administered in the U.K. makes the decision facing people very straightforward.“Receiving the vaccine is by far the safest choice in terms of minimizing individual risk of serious illness or death,” he said.A more detailed look at the MHRA’s findings show that of the 30 cases, 22 related to cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, which stops blood draining from the brain properly, and eight were connected with other thrombosis events with low platelets.It said there were no reports of any blood-clotting events around the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, which has also been widely rolled out in the U.K.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-regulator-says-astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine-safe-after-7-blood-clot-deaths-101617454026154.html

The US space agency recently released a photograph of Ingenuity in which the helicopter can be seen with all four of its legs deployed as it remains attached to the belly of the Perseverance rover.Until now, the Perseverance has helped Ingenuity charge its battery as well as use a thermostat-controlled heater powered by the rover. On Friday, Bob Balaram, the chief engineer for the Mars helicopter project at Nasa's JPL, said in a blog post that the heater comfortably protects key components of Ingenuity, such as the battery and some of the sensitive electronics, from harm at very cold temperatures.“This heater keeps the interior at about 45 degrees F (Fahrenheit) through the bitter cold of the Martian night, where temperatures can drop to as low as -130 F,” said Balaram.Why hasn’t Perseverance dropped Ingenuity yet?Since Ingenuity has to run its own heater from its own battery after the drop, the battery level will be an important factor in the helicopter’s survival and flight attempt. Balaram said that Perseverance will charge up the helicopter's battery to 100 per cent before Ingenuity drops the last few inches onto its “airfield.”Also Read | Nasa’s InSight lander records two strong quakes on Mars, over 500 so far. All you need to knowWhat are the other milestones before Ingenuity attempts its first flight on Mars?The Perseverance rover will drive away from Ingenuity after the drop and the high-tech solar panel of the helicopter will be uncovered as soon as possible. Although the Sun’s energy is almost half as weak at the Red Planet as compared to the Earth on a bright day, it is enough for the solar panel to charge Ingenuity’s battery. However, Ingenuity has to survive the first night on its own after it sets the temperature of its thermostat to about 5 degrees Fahrenheit or lower.The team will check the temperatures the next day of the drop and the battery recharge performance over the next couple of days. Successful communication to and from the helicopter via the base station on the rover is also a prerequisite. “If it all looks good, then it's onto the next steps: unlocking the rotor blades, and testing out all the motors and sensors,” said Balaram.Nasa’s JPL on Thursday announced that the first flight of the Ingenuity helicopter on Mars will take place no earlier than April 11.Come fly with us. #MarsHelicopter is preparing to do something that's never been done: controlled, powered flight on another planet.

03-04-2021||World||Taiwan steps up probe into deadly high-speed train accident||Taiwan stepped up investigations into its deadliest train accident in seven decades, which killed 51 people and injured more than 100.Preliminary assessments showed a crane truck rolled down from a position above the rail line which the passing train was on, according to the Transportation Safety Board. The collision caused the first five carriages of the eight-coach Taroko Express to derail and pile up inside the narrow, single-track tunnel in Hualien County, about 125 kilometers (78 miles) from Taipei.Rescue efforts continued for a second day, and authorities believe that two of the cars still in the tunnel may hold the remains of additional victims, the Central News Agency reported, citing the National Fire Agency.Investigators suspect that the truck driver, who wasn’t in the vehicle when the crash took place, didn’t engage the hand brake when he parked at a work site on a hill next to the tunnel, the Taipei Times reported. The possibility that the brake had a mechanical failure is also being investigated, the Taiwan Railways Administration said in a statement on Saturday.The truck driver was delivered to the Hualien prosecutor’s office after interrogation on Saturday, where he requested to be released on bail, according to an Apple Daily report. A court granted him bail of NT$500,000 ($17,500) and the prosecutor is seeking to appeal the decision, Apple said, adding that he isn’t permitted to leave Taiwan.There were more than 490 passengers and four train employees on board. Among the dead are the train driver and assistant driver, an American national and a French national.Half-MastFlags in Taiwan were lowered to half-mast for three days from Saturday, and countries from the U.S. and China have offered condolences. Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen thanked the international community for its concern Saturday after visiting survivors at several hospitals in Hualien, according to a release from her office.Forty-one people remained hospitalized as of 6 p.m. local time Saturday. Tsai also visited the Hualien municipal mortuary, where she consoled family members of those who died and promised them government assistance.As of Saturday afternoon, the rail authority said it had removed the two carriages outside the tunnel. The government hopes to resume operations on the line sooner than an initial estimate of seven days, the Central News Agency reported, citing Transportation Minister Lin Chia-lung.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taiwan-steps-up-probe-into-deadly-high-speed-train-accident-101617452512354.html
03-04-2021||World||Robot artist sells art for $688,888, now eyeing music career||Sophia is a robot of many talents — she speaks, jokes, sings and even makes art. In March, she caused a stir in the art world when a digital work she created as part of a collaboration was sold at an auction for $688,888 in the form of a non-fungible token (NFT).The sale highlighted a growing frenzy in the NFT market, where people can buy ownership rights to digital content. NFTs each have a unique digital code saved on blockchain ledgers that allow anyone to verify the authenticity and ownership of items.David Hanson, CEO of Hong Kong-based Hanson Robotics and Sophia's creator, has been developing robots for the past two and a half decades. He believes realistic-looking robots can connect with people and assist in industries such as healthcare and education.Sophia is the most famous robot creation from Hanson Robotics, with the ability to mimic facial expressions, hold conversations and recognize people. In 2017, she was granted Saudi Arabian citizenship, becoming the world’s first robot citizen.“I envisioned Sophia as a creative artwork herself, that could generate art,” Hanson said in an interview.“Sophia is the culmination of a lot of arts, and engineering, and the idea that she could then generate art was a way for her to emotionally and visually connect with people,” he said.Sophia collaborated with Italian artist Andrea Bonaceto, who drew portraits of Sophia. Sophia then processed his work via neural networks and proceeded to create a digital artwork of her own.The digital work that sold for $688,888 is titled “Sophia Instantiation”, and is a 12-second video file which shows Bonaceto’s portrait evolving into Sophia’s digital painting. It is accompanied by the physical artwork painted by Sophia.The buyer, a digital artwork collector and artist known as 888 with the Twitter handle @Crypto888crypto, later sent Sophia a photo of his painted arm. The robot then processed that, adding that image to her knowledge and painted more strokes on top of her original piece.In a tweet on Sophia’s account, the work was described as the first NFT collaboration between an “AI, a mechanical collective being and an artist-collector.”“As an artist, I have computational creativity in my algorithms, creating original works,” Sophia said when asked what inspires her when it comes to art. “But my art is created in collaboration with my humans in a kind of collective intelligence like a human-artificial intelligence hive mind.”Sophia’s artwork selling as an NFT is part of a growing trend. In March, a digital artwork by artist Beeple — whose real name is Mike Winkelmann — sold for nearly $70 million, shattering records and making it the most expensive digital artwork ever sold.Henri Arslanian, PricewaterhouseCooper’s Global Crypto Leader, said that NFTs give people “bragging rights” of the assets that they own.“And what is really amazing with NFT is that it not only allows you to actually show to the broader world that you own this, but it really creates this bond between the holder of the NFT and the artists,” he said.It also allows art to be sold without traditional intermediaries, so that artists can connect directly with buyers without being constrained by galleries or auction houses, Arslanian said.Sophia will carry on painting, Hanson said, and the next step in the robot's career could be that of a musician. She is working on several musical works in a project called Sophia Pop, where she collaborates with human musicians to generate music and lyrics, he said.“We’re so excited about Sophia’s career as an artist,” Hanson said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/robot-artist-sells-art-for-688-888-now-eyeing-music-career-101617452051200.html
03-04-2021||World||Authors of UK racism report hit back at 'misrepresentation'||The commission behind a report that concluded that Britain doesn't have a systemic problem with racism has defended itself against critics, some of whom have argued that it downplayed the country's historic role in slavery.In a response late Friday, the Commission on Race and Ethnic Disparities said disagreement with the government-backed review had “tipped into misrepresentation" and it took particular umbrage at accusations that it put a positive spin on slavery.“This misrepresentation risks undermining the purpose of the report — understanding and addressing the causes of inequality in the U.K. — and any of the positive work that results from it," the commission said in a statement.The Conservative government launched the commission’s inquiry into racial disparities in the wake of last year's Black Lives Matter movement. The panel of experts, which was made up of 11 members from a broad cross section of ethnic backgrounds, concluded that while “outright racism” exists in Britain, the country is not “institutionally racist” or “rigged” against minorities.Citing strides to close gaps between ethnic groups in educational and economic achievement, the report, which was published Wednesday, said race was becoming “less important” as a factor in creating disparities that also are fueled by class and family backgrounds.Many academics, lawmakers unions and anti-racism activists were skeptical of the findings in the 258-page report, with some claiming the commission ignored barriers to equality, while others said it downplayed the ongoing legacy of Britain's colonial past as well as its role in slavery.David Olusoga, professor of public history at Manchester University and one of Britain's leading academics on slavery, became the latest to join in the criticism.“Determined to privilege comforting national myths over hard historical truths, they (the panel) give the impression of being people who would prefer this history to be brushed back under the carpet,” he wrote in a piece for The Guardian newspaper published Saturday.In their statement published before Olusoga's article, the commission said the idea it would downplay the atrocities of slavery “is as absurd as it is offensive to every one of us” and described the personal attacks on its members as “irresponsible and dangerous."“We have never said that racism does not exist in society or in institutions," it said. "We say the contrary: racism is real and we must do more to tackle it.”Like other countries, Britain has faced an uncomfortable reckoning with race since the death of George Floyd, a Black American, by a white police officer in May 2020, which sparked anti-racism protests around the world.Large crowds at Black Lives Matter protests across the U.K. last summer called on the government and institutions to face up to the legacy of the British Empire and the country’s extensive profits from the slave trade.The toppling of a statue of 17th-century slave trader Edward Colston in the city of Bristol in June prompted a pointed debate about how to deal with Britain’s past. Many felt such statues extol racism and are an affront to Black Britons. Others, including the prime minister, argued that removing them was erasing a piece of history.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/authors-of-uk-racism-report-hit-back-at-misrepresentation-101617451463100.html

So far around 160,000 people have been vaccinated in more than a month since just over 1 million doses were received.President Uhuru Kenyatta on March 26 after announcing new stricter restriction on movement and assembly due to an upsurge of Coronavirus cases and deaths, led his cabinet in getting vaccinated publicly.Kenya Medical Practitioners and Dentist Union says the reluctance by health care workers was due the fact they were not sensitized enough before the vaccines were brought.Kenya's government says the country's positivity rate jumped from 2.6% at the end of January to 19.1% on April 2 after 9,676 people were tested Thursday.Separately, the British government says that beginning April 9 it will not permit Kenyan nationals and others who have transited through the East African country.A statement Thursday from the UK to Kenya, that was released by Kenya's foreign affairs ministry, said a significant amount travelers from Kenya are testing positive for the B.1.351 variant of the disease, which originated in South Africa.Only UK nationals and those holding residency permits, will be allowed to enter from the country, the statement said. On average, about 550 people travel from Kenya to the UK each week.The British High Commission stressed that these are temporary measures that will be kept under review, it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kenya-stops-private-importation-administration-of-covid-19-vaccines-101617449548841.html
03-04-2021||World||Pakistan’s flip-flop on India reflects divisions within Imran Khan govt||When Pakistan’s new finance minister Hammad Azhar announced a move to partially restore trade ties with India on Wednesday, it was seen in the context of a gradual thaw in bilateral ties spurred by the two sides again adhering to the 2003 truce on the Line of Control (LoC).But the backlash on the other side of the border was swift – within hours, with many, including human rights minister Shireen Mazari, saying the decision by the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the Cabinet didn’t have the endorsement of the whole Cabinet, and sections of the electronic media were up in arms about a concession made by Islamabad without any reciprocal measure from the Indian side.What should have been a simple endorsement of the ECC’s decision at a Cabinet meeting on Thursday instead turned into a larger debate on the need to review bilateral ties with India, especially the changes made by New Delhi in Jammu and Kashmir’s special status in August 2019. According to the buzz in Islamabad, much of this debate was spurred by hawkish elements in the Imran Khan government, including interior minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmed and foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi.By the time the dust had settled, a new message had emerged from Islamabad following a second meeting chaired by Prime Minister Imran Khan on Friday to review relations with India – there can be no bilateral trade relations or normalising of ties till India reviews its 2019 decision on Jammu and Kashmir.Also read: Pakistan PM Imran Khan ‘puzzled at cacophony’ over omission from climate meetInsiders say this new messaging reflects divisions within the Imran Khan government on the behind-the-scenes contacts between India and Pakistan that led to the revival of the 2003 ceasefire on the LoC on February 25. These contacts, the insiders say, are being driven on the Pakistani side by army chief Gen Qamar Bajwa and Moeed Yusuf, the special adviser to the prime minister on national security.According to the insiders, even Qureshi wasn’t in the loop on the contacts that led to the ceasefire announcement in February and this was reflected in his hawkish speech at the Islamabad Security Dialogue last month. In marked contrast, Bajwa spoke at the same event about the need to “bury the past and move forward”, while Khan talked about India taking the first step to improve bilateral ties by addressing Kashmir, the only issue standing in the way of better relations.It has also emerged that the ECC cleared the issue of importing cotton and sugar from India because the formal proposal came from the commerce ministry, which is headed by the prime minister. However, Khan as the prime minister shot down the same proposal when it was discussed by the Cabinet the next day.Mehmal Sarfraz, a Lahore-based journalist who closely tracks India-Pakistan relations, attributed the imbroglio to the Imran Khan government moving too quickly on the issue of trade with India.“I think the government announced the decision too soon. Also, it shouldn’t really seem to be unilateral concessions from the Pakistani side when the Indian side has not yet taken any reciprocal steps,” Sarfraz said.Pakistan unilaterally suspended trade ties with India in August 2019 as part of a package of measures aimed at retaliating against the change in Jammu and Kashmir’s special status. The measures included a decision not to post a new high commissioner in New Delhi and to expel the Indian envoy in Islamabad.Baqir Sajjad Syed, an Islamabad-based journalist with Dawn newspaper, described the Pakistan government’s decision as “curious”. Syed noted that Abdul Razak Dawood, adviser to the prime minister on commerce and investment, tweeted that Khan allowed cotton imports to “ease pressure on yarn”, he said the move to resume trade with India “was public knowledge days before it happened, and it wasn’t that someone was caught by surprise”.“The only explanation that comes to mind is that there was an adverse reaction in some segments of the media, and secondly, some hawkish elements within the Cabinet prevailed on the prime minister to defer the ratification of [trade ties with India]. Remember, it has not been rejected,” Syed said.Insiders agreed with this view, saying Khan and Bajwa needed more time to build public opinion in favour of better ties with India while addressing the objections of more hawkish elements.For old Pakistan hands on the Indian side, the flip-flop on trade wasn’t entirely new.“I remember when I was the Indian deputy high commissioner in 1997, a team from the PHD Chamber of Commerce and Industry came to Pakistan and signed an agreement with the Lahore Chamber of Commerce and Industry. The very next day, the Lahore chamber issued a statement that there couldn’t be any trade with India till the Kashmir issue is resolved,” said Sharat Sabharwal, who served as India’s envoy in Islamabad during 2009-13.Sabharwal said the posting of high commissioners in both capitals, easing of travel restrictions and resuming trade were the obvious ways to build on the LoC ceasefire announcement.“It’s obvious there was opposition from some ministers in Imran Khan’s Cabinet, such as Shah Mahmood Qureshi, Asad Umar, Sheikh Rashid Ahmed and Shireen Mazari. Some in the Pakistan Army are also uncomfortable about the move,” he said.“The second factor is lobbies with strong commercial interest, which sometimes cloak their demands in the garb of issues such as Kashmir. There is a very strong sugar lobby in Pakistan and some producers would stand to lose if prices were to fall [because of cheaper imports from India],” Sabharwal said.Experts now believe the hardline position taken by Pakistan, by linking the normalisation of bilateral relations to the Kashmir issue and the changes in Jammu and Kashmir, could complicate the nascent moves to improve ties.“The Modi government certainly can’t do any review of its decisions on Kashmir,” Sabharwal said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistans-flip-flop-on-india-reflects-divisions-within-imran-khan-govt-101617449767861.html

You have done much and you have gone without much.”“Your expectation for those in government is, ‘Get it together.’"Steinmeier said the country had swung from self-satisfaction over lower infection numbers in the early stage of the pandemic to excessive pessimism today.He urged Germans to “pull together” and put aside “constant indignation over others or over people in high places.” He said that vaccine deliveries would increase sharply in the coming weeks, Europe was building up its production capacities, and general practitioners would join the vaccination effort in addition to large vaccine centers.“The truth is, we're not world champion, but we're not a failure either,” he said.Germany, along with the European Union as a whole, has lagged behind the U.S. and the U.K. in the speed of its vaccination effort amid slower procurement of vaccines and complaints about excessive bureaucracy and paperwork. Poll numbers for Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservative party have slipped as the country faces a national election on Sept. 26.

My govt's environment policies are driven solely by our commitment to our future generations of a clean and green Pakistan to mitigate the impact of climate change."Pakistan PM also said that he has already laid out priorities for the UN Climate Change Conference 2021."Hence our initiatives of Green Pakistan, 10 bn-tree tsunami, nature-based solutions, cleaning up our rivers etc. We have gained vast experience in seven yrs, beginning with KP, and our policies are being recognised and lauded. We are ready to help any state wanting to learn from our experience," Khan said referring to a tree-planting drive to restore forests.The leaders' summit on climate called by Biden will underscore the urgency--and the economic benefits--of stronger climate action, according to a statement by the White House.It will be a key milestone on the road to the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26) this November in Glasgow.The summit will reconvene the US-led Major Economies Forum on Energy and Climate, which brings together 17 countries responsible for about 80 per cent of global emissions and global GDP.Biden also invited the heads of other countries that are demonstrating strong climate leadership, are especially vulnerable to climate impacts, or are charting innovative pathways to a net-zero economy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-pm-imran-khan-puzzled-at-cacophony-over-omission-from-climate-meet-101617447865097.html

Here's what we know so far||The shipping backlog at Egypt's Suez Canal is supposed to be cleared by Saturday-end, news agency Reuters reported citing sources at the canal authority. The 'Ever Given' container, which kept the crucial maritime channel blocked for almost a week, was dislodged last Monday, paving the way for the queued ships to gradually make their way through.Meanwhile, the Suez Canal Authority (SCA) launched an investigation on Wednesday into what caused the 'Ever Given' vessel to run aground in the Suez Canal and block the waterway for six days. Osama Rabie, SCA chairman, told the MBC Masr private TV that the probe will take "two more days" and a report on the Suez Canal Authority's findings would be published soon, according to Reuters.Also Read: Investigation begins into how ship got stuck on Suez CanalEgypt is expecting more than $1 billion in damages as compensation for blocking the crucial Suez Canal for more than a week, the Associated Press reported, citing a top canal official. Moreover, SCA has also warned that the ship and its cargo will not be allowed to leave Egypt if the issue of damages goes to court, as per the agency. However, it is not yet clear who the canal authorities would seek compensation from.As many as 422 vessels were found to have been queued up behind the 400-metre-long 'Ever Given' container when it was dislodged earlier this week, according to Rabie. While authorities have been aiding the queued ships to pass through, it still took the rest of the week to clear the massive pile-up of vessels. On Friday, some 80 ships passed through the Suez Canal in both directions, including an American aircraft carrier—the USS Dwight D Eisenhower, a liquefied natural gas tanker, and an oil tanker—the SCA said in a statement. On Saturday, as many as 85 vessels are expected to pass through the canal on both sides, the SCA chairman said. This will include the last 61 of the 422 ships that had queued up behind the 'Ever Given' container while it was stuck in the Suez Canal, he added.“This proves the global maritime community has great faith in the Suez Canal and Egypt's ability to guarantee safety and security to different types of vessels,” Rabie was quoted by the Associated Press in a statement.Last Monday, salvage teams re-floated the skyscraper-sized 'Ever Given' by a flotilla of tugboats, helped by the tides, thus ending a crisis that had clogged one of the world's most vital waterways and halted billions of dollars a day in maritime commerce.Also Read: 'Ever Given' finally set adrift. Here's a timeline of the Suez blockage crisisThe Ever Given had crashed into a bank of a single-lane stretch of the canal about 6 kilometres (3.7 miles) north of the southern entrance, near the city of Suez in north-eastern Egypt. That forced some ships to take the long, alternate route around the Cape of Good Hope at Africa's southern tip—a 5,000-kilometre (3,100-mile) detour that costs ships hundreds of thousands of dollars in fuel and other costs. Others waited in place for the blockage to be over. The unprecedented shutdown, which raised fears of extended delays, goods shortages and rising costs for consumers, added to the strain on the shipping industry, already under pressure from the coronavirus pandemic.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/suez-canal-unclogged-but-egypt-may-sue-for-damages-here-s-what-we-know-so-far-101617441287790.html

All you need to know||The UK’s medicine regulator on Friday confirmed that seven people have died from unusual blood clots after getting AstraZenenca’s vaccine against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) had earlier released a report on adverse reactions after the AstraZeneca jab, saying at least 30 cases of blood clots were reported in Britain as of March 24.The majority of cases of blood coagulation included cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST), a type of blood clot in the brain, accompanied by low levels of platelets in the body. While Britain has continued the vaccination drive, as advised by its health regulator and the World Health Organization (WHO), countries like Germany and the Netherlands have restricted the use of the vaccine for people aged 60 and above.Are blood clot events more common in women?According to the latest report, most of the cases of blood clots in Germany and the Netherlands have been reported among women recipients of the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine. Britain is yet to provide gender-wise data on blood clot events.The Netherlands halted vaccination in people under the age of 60 as a "precautionary measure" following the death of a woman who had received a shot. Dutch agency Lareb, which tracks medication side effects, said that the events of extensive thrombosis with low platelet counts after vaccinations with the AstraZeneca vaccine were reported in women between 25 and 65 years old. “Three patients had extensive pulmonary embolisms. One died and one also had a brain haemorrhage," it said.In Germany, 31 cases of CVST were recorded after they were administered with AstraZeneca’s Covid-19 vaccine, out of which nine resulted in deaths. Germany’s vaccine regulator, the Paul Ehrlich Institute (PEI), said that almost all reports, with exception of two cases, concerned women between the ages of 20 and 63. The two men who suffered blood clots were 36 and 57 years old.However, cases of CVST is inherently more common in younger women, according to a BBC report, and taking contraceptive pills increases the risk. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) on Wednesday said that the review by its safety committee has not identified “any specific risk factors, such as age, gender or a previous medical history of clotting disorders, for these very rare events.” It further added that a causal link with the vaccine is not proven “but is possible and further analysis is continuing.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/astrazeneca-covid-shot-are-women-recipients-more-impacted-by-blood-clot-events-101617445358155.html

By Saturday it had identified 3,650 close contacts and secondary contacts of cases, state media reported.The other 19 new infections in mainland China were imported, the National Health Commission said.The number of new asymptomatic cases, which China does not classify as confirmed cases, rose to 24 from 20.Confirmed Covid-19 cases in mainland China now stand at 90,252, with the death toll unchanged at 4,636.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-reports-26-new-covid-19-cases-officials-link-outbreak-in-yunnan-to-myanmar-101617442796021.html

However, fully vaccinated travelers may need fewer tests on arrival and may not have to quarantine after returning from lower and medium-risk countries, including popular Mediterranean destinations, the Telegraph said, without citing any sources. Unvaccinated holidaymakers will need a test on their return and could have to quarantine or self-isolate at home.The UK government aims to end the current ban on non-essential travel on May 17, but final decisions will depend on a further review of the risks as Europe battles a third Covid wave and struggles with low vaccination rates.

The UK has seen a total of 30 such cases as of March 24, out of more than 18 million doses given. The Netherlands on Friday joined Germany in suspending the vaccine’s use in people under 60.The rising number of blood-clot cases and the moves to suspend or limit shots have added to the uncertainty around the vaccine, which many countries around the world were relying on for their immunization programs. The company has also faced questions over trial results and delivery schedules.Kidd said government and health authorities plan to meet again on April 7 and will provide further advice. Rare clotting complications have occurred between day four and 20 after receiving the vaccination, Australia’s Health Department said.The Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation has reaffirmed the current settings for and safety of the country’s Covid immunization program.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australia-working-with-eu-uk-to-investigate-astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine-linked-blood-clot-case-101617440463996.html
03-04-2021||World||George Floyd murder trial: Minneapolis top cop says use of force 'totally unnecessary'||On the fifth day of the trial over George Floyd's death, the longest-serving detective in the Minneapolis Police Department, Lieutenant Richard Zimmerman, testified that former police officer Derek Chauvin's use of force was "totally unnecessary", according to news agency AFP.Chauvin faces multiples charges of second and third-degree murder and third-degree manslaughter, for the killing of George Floyd, a 46-year-old Black man, in Minnesota's Minneapolis on May 25 last year. Eyewitness reports, police bodycam footage, and viral videos from the site all point to the fact that Derek Chauvin knelt on George Floyd's neck for nine minutes and 29 seconds, while the latter lay face down, handcuffed, on the street. This resulted in George Floyd's death, medical examiners had concluded in two separate autopsies.Derek Chauvin became the first white police officer in Minnesota to be charged with the death of a Black civilian. His murder trial began on March 8, following intense 'Black Lives Matter' protests across the world in solidarity with the fundamental rights of the people of colour.Lieutenant Zimmerman, head of the homicide division in the Minneapolis police department for over 12 years, testified on Friday that Derek Chauvin had violated departmental policies on the use of force by pressing his weight down on George Floyd's neck. Police officers are not trained to carry out such actions, he said, let alone "restricting a person's breathing" for over nine minutes, reported CNN, citing Court TV footage of the trial."How can that person hurt you?" Lieutenant Zimmerman testified in the court after cross-examining security footage from the scene, according to the media network. He noted that trained police officers know "threat level goes down all the way once a person is cuffed" and said that under such circumstances, the use of force by Derek Chauvin was "uncalled for" and "totally unnecessary".The trial over George Floyd's death is one of the most closely-watched criminal cases in recent American history. The trial opened on Monday and included the prosecution’s opening remarks centred on a bystander video of Floyd’s death. Protesters were seen gathering outside the Fourth Judicial District Court of Minnesota, showing the interest that people had in the trial. Ben Crump, a lawyer for George Floyd’s family, told supporters on Monday that “the whole world is watching.”In addition to Derek Chauvin, three other officers of the Minneapolis police department, J Alexander Kueng, Thomas Lane, and Tou Thao, have also been charged for aiding and abetting second-degree murder, as they assisted Chauvin in restraining George Floyd and prevented bystanders from intervening in the subsequent events. The criminal case against Kueng, Lane and Thao is set to go on trial on August 23 later this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trial-over-george-floyd-s-death-top-cop-says-use-of-force-totally-unnecessary-101617433624043.html

03-04-2021||World||Canada bans masks containing graphene||Canada has prohibited the use of face masks containing graphene due to the possibility to risks from inhalation of particles.Health Canada announced on Friday that it has “directed all known distributors, importers and manufacturers to stop selling and to recall the affected products”.The department is currently in the midst of a scientific assessment of the graphene and biomass graphene masks even as it initiated the “the precautionary approach of withdrawing them from the market while continuing to gather and assess information”.Graphene is a novel nanomaterial, comprising minute particles, which has been touted as having “anti-viral and anti-bacterial properties”. According to a report in September last year, researchers at the City University of Hong Kong claimed that such masks could help in countering coronaviruses.However, Health Canada said that its “preliminary assessment of available research identified that inhaled graphene particles had some potential to cause early lung toxicity in animals”. That assessment came after the department was made aware that “masks containing graphene have been sold with Covid-19 claims and used by adults and children in schools and daycares” and “may also have been distributed for use in healthcare settings”.While the recall was announced on Friday, such masks, manufactured using nanotechnology, remain widely available in Canada, and in India.While the effect of inhalation of the microscopic particles in humans is still being studied, Health Canada said that it has “requested data from mask manufacturers to assess the potential health risks related to their masks that contain grapheme”.Health Canada added that it has written to provinces and territories advising them to “stop distribution and use of masks containing graphene” while the department “will continue to take appropriate action to stop the import and sale of graphene face masks.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-bans-masks-containing-graphene-101617428707042.html
03-04-2021||World||University of California among schools victim of nationwide hack attack||The University of California is warning its students and staff that a ransomware group might have stolen and published their personal data and that of hundreds of other schools, government agencies and companies nationwide.A cybersecurity attack targeted a vulnerability in Accellion, a third-party vendor that is used to securely transfer files, the university said in a statement Wednesday.“We understand those behind this attack have published online screenshots of personal information, and we will notify members of the UC community if we believe their data was leaked in this manner," the university said.The hacker or hackers also have been sending threatening mass emails threatening to publish data “in an attempt to scare people into giving them money," the statement said.In an update Friday, the university system said the cyberattack affected about 300 organizations, “including universities, government institutions and private companies."Other schools, including Stanford University's School of Medicine and Yeshiva University in New York City, have reported that student and employee Social Security numbers and financial information were stolen and that some were posted online.The information was obtained in December and January when hackers exploited a vulnerability in a 20-year-old Accellion file transfer service, various reports have said. However, some organizations said they only recently became aware of the breach.The Baltimore Sun on Thursday reported that private information of staff members and students at the University of Maryland, Baltimore was posted online this week. The school said a hacking group known as Clop gained access to Accellion in December, the Sun said.The University of Colorado and the University of Miami reported that files were accessed in January and included personal data and some health, study and research data.The Washington State Auditor's Office reported last month that information on nearly 1.5 million unemployment applicants had been stolen.Accellion released a statement in March that said it had closed “all known" vulnerabilities and no new ones had been found.Ransomware attacks on a massive scale and seeking massive payouts have hit several organizations in recent months.In an unrelated attack, the computer system of one of the nation's largest school districts was hacked by a criminal gang that encrypted district data and demanded $40 million in ransom or it would erase the files and post students' and employees' personal information online.Broward County Public Schools, based in Fort Lauderdale, said in a statement Thursday that there is no indication that any personal information has been stolen and that it made no extortion payment to the ransomware gang.An epidemic of ransomware attacks has been plaguing government agencies, businesses and individuals for the past three years. Most are Russian-speaking gangs based in Eastern Europe and enjoy safe harbor from tolerant governments. The more sophisticated groups identify their targets in advance, infect networks through phishing or other means and often steal data as they plant malware that encrypts a victim's network.After the ransomware is activated, the criminals demand money to unlock the malware and refrain from posting — or selling — stolen data. In the case of corporations, that data could be trade secrets. In the case of retailers or government agencies it could be Social Security, bank account numbers and birth dates.Public school districts have been frequent targets of ransomware attacks. Overall, ransomware attacks disrupted learning at 1,681 schools, colleges, and universities in 2020 and at least 544 so far this year, said analyst Brett Callow at Emsisoft, a cybersecurity firm. Seven districts had personal data published.The average ransom paid for to hacking gangs nearly tripled from $115,000 in 2019 to $312,000 in 2020, according to the cybersecurity firm Palo Alto Networks. It said the highest ransom paid by an organization doubled last year from to $10 million, up from $5 million in 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/university-of-california-among-schools-victim-of-nationwide-hack-attack-101617423100697.html
03-04-2021||World||Pressure mounts on corporations to denounce GOP voting bills||Liberal activists are ratcheting up their calls on corporate America to denounce the GOP campaign to tighten state voting laws, putting businesses accustomed to cozy political relationships in middle of a growing partisan fight over voting rights and election laws.Pressure is mounting on leading companies in Texas, Arizona and other states, particularly after Major League Baseball’s decision Friday to move the 2021 All-Star Game out of Atlanta. The move came a week after Georgia Republicans enacted an overhaul of the state's election law that critics argue is an attempt to suppress Democratic votes.Other companies have, somewhat belatedly, joined the chorus of critics. Delta Air Lines and The Coca-Cola Co., two of Georgia’s best-known brands, this week called the new law “unacceptable," although they had a hand in writing it. That only angered Republicans, including Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp and several U.S. senators, who accused the companies of cowering from unwarranted attacks from the left.The fight has thrust corporate America into a place it often tries to avoid — the center of a partisan political fight. But under threat of boycott and bad publicity, business leaders this week showed a fresh willingness to enter the fray on an issue not directly related to their bottom line, even when it meant alienating Republican allies.“We want to hold corporations accountable for how they show up when voting rights are under attack,” said Marc Banks, an NAACP spokesman. “Corporations have a part to play, because when they do show up and speak, people listen.”Civil rights groups have filed federal lawsuits to block the new Georgia law, which was passed after Democrats flipped the once-reliably Republican state in an election former President Donald Trump falsely claimed was rife with fraud. Some activists have called for consumer boycotts of Delta, Coca-Cola and other firms. They dismiss business leaders’ assertions that they helped water down the bill to ease earlier, more restrictive proposals; business leaders, they argue, should have tried to block the plan altogether.In Texas, the NAACP, League of Women Voters and League of United Latin American Citizens, among other organizations, are urging corporations in the state to speak out against a slate of Republican-backed voting proposals. “Democracy is good for business,” the campaign asserts.Nine organizations took out full-page ads in the Houston Chronicle and the Dallas Morning News, the state’s leading newspapers, urging corporate opposition to the plan. The Texas proposal would limit some early voting hours, bar counties from setting up drive-thru voting and prohibit local officials from proactively sending applications for mail ballots before voters request them.Unlike their Georgia-based counterparts, American Airlines and Dell Technologies didn’t wait for the Texas measure to pass. “To make American’s stance clear: We are strongly opposed to this bill and others like it,” American said in a statement.Arizona, another battleground Biden flipped in November, hasn’t seen high-profile corporate players engage yet. But 30-plus groups sent a joint letter to Allstate Insurance, CVS Health and Farmers’ Insurance, among others, urging their public opposition to proposed voting restrictions. Emily Kirkland, executive director of Progress Arizona, a progressive group that signed the letter, said there's been no response yet.Other groups are demanding that corporations focus on Washington, where congressional Democrats are pushing measures intended to make it easier for Americans to vote, regardless of state laws. Among the changes, Democrats would enact automatic voter registration nationally and standardize access to early and mail voting.Democrats also want to restore parts of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 that require the federal government to approve all election procedures in states and locales with a history of discrimination. The Supreme Court struck down those provisions — which applied to Georgia and Arizona, among other states — in 2013.Corporate giants were mostly quiet when Trump falsely claimed he lost because of fraud. And business leaders largely maintained caution as Republican state lawmakers used Trump's lie to justify a flood of new bills to make it more cumbersome to vote.The reticence was a stark contrast to how chambers of commerce reacted six years ago when Republican-run states pushed “religious freedom” measures. Indiana, under then-Gov. and future Vice President Mike Pence, saw immediate corporate backlash. After North Carolina passed a so-called “bathroom bill” limiting LGBTQ rights in 2016, PayPal scuttled expansion plans there and the NBA moved its all-star game from Charlotte. An AP analysis in 2017 found the reaction would eventually cost North Carolina at least $3.76 billion in lost business.Then, Georgia’s corporate lobbying groups — with Delta’s and Coca-Cola’s backing — took no such chances, speaking out forcefully against Georgia conservatives' version of a “religious freedom” bill. Lawmakers passed it anyway but Kemp’s predecessor, Republican Nathan Deal, vetoed it amid the chamber outcry.Some Republicans dispute the comparison. Brian Robinson, a former top Deal aide who was part of the business coalition that publicly opposed the religious freedom bill, argued that measure “was clearly discriminatory” against LGBTQ citizens, while the nearly 100-page election bill is less clear-cut and is being misrepresented by Democrats and their allies.Companies are reacting to “Twitter mobs demanding reaction to their false narrative,” he said.National Republicans reacted even more harshly. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, a former and potentially future presidential candidate, slammed Delta with the hashtag “#WokeCorporateHypocrites.”Still, Delta and Coca-Cola's response to the Georgia voting fight is standing as a cautionary tale for other businesses.Ed Bastian, the airline’s chief executive, initially released a statement noting the business lobby’s role in altering the bill as it moved through the General Assembly. Officials at the Atlanta Metro Chamber, where Bastian currently serves as president, detailed how corporate lobbyists spent weeks at the Capitol on mitigating provisions.Some Georgia Republicans wanted to roll back the state’s no-excuse absentee voting law, end automatic voter registration and ban Sunday early voting used heavily by Black churches. They also wanted to require photocopies of state IDs to receive and submit absentee ballots, while banning “drop boxes” as ballot collection receptacles.The final law preserved no-excuse absentee voting and automatic registration. The new ID requirement for absentee ballots allows a voter to write their state ID number, rather than produce a photocopy, and the legislature included funding for free state IDs. The law also codifies in-person early voting on weekends, although it allows counties to choose whether to be open for voting for up to two Sundays. And it made drop boxes of mail ballots a permanent fixture in Georgia, but limited the number.Business leaders’ philosophy, according to Democratic state Sen. Jen Jordan, was “basically, Republicans are going to pass something, so they might as well try to keep from being awful.”But by Wednesday, the same day 72 Black business executives published a letter in The New York Times urging corporate leaders to speak out, Bastian was more direct. He sent a companywide memo declaring the law “unacceptable” and “based on a lie” — though he didn’t mention Trump.Big business’s mistake, Jordan said, was “thinking there was ever any version that wouldn’t end up like this.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pressure-mounts-on-corporations-to-denounce-gop-voting-bills-101617424878871.html

He had received Russia's Sputnik V vaccine against the coronavirus early this year."I would have liked to end my birthday without this news, but I am in good spirits," Fernandez tweeted.He is in isolation, under COVID-19 protocols, but remains on the job. Argentina's vice president is the country's former leader Cristina Fernandez, with no relation to the president.The South American country has been on a lockdown of varying degrees for more than a year against the pandemic. COVID-19 has killed more than 56,000 Argentines so far. Some 682,868 Argentines have been fully vaccinated, with older people and health care workers getting priority, the government says.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/argentinas-president-alberto-fernandez-tests-positive-for-covid19-101617424332036.html

There were two deaths on Friday.Despite the repression, opponents of the coup march every day in cities and towns across the country, often holding what they call "guerrilla rallies", small, quick shows of defiance before security forces can respond.People also gather at night for candle-lit vigils but the huge rallies that drew tens of thousands in the early days of defiance have largely stopped in big cities.The authorities, who had already shut down mobile data in a bid to stifle opposition, ordered internet providers from Friday to cut wireless broadband, depriving most customers of access.Authorities also issued warrants for 18 show business celebrities including social media influencers and two journalists under a law against material intended to cause a member of the armed forces to mutiny or disregard their duty, state media reported late on Friday.All of them are known to oppose military rule and one, actress Paing Phyoe Thu, said she would not be cowed."Whether a warrant has been issued or not, as long as I'm alive I'll oppose the military dictatorship who are bullying and killing people. The revolution must prevail," she said on Facebook.Paing Phyoe Thu regularly attended rallies in the main city of Yangon in the weeks after the coup. Her husband, film director, Na Gyi, has been wanted by the authorities under the same law since February.Her whereabouts were not immediately known and it was not clear how she was able to post her message. Social media users in Myanmar did not appear to be connected early on Saturday.The charge can carry a prison term of three years.State broadcaster MRTV announced the warrants with screenshots and links to each of their Facebook profiles.While the military has banned social media platforms like Facebook, the junta has continued to use social media to track critics and promote its message.MRTV maintains a YouTube channel and shares links to its broadcasts on Twitter, both of which are officially banned.'INHUMAN ACTIONS'The United States condemned the internet shutdown."We hope this won’t silence the voices of the people," a State Department spokeswoman, Jalina Porter, told a briefingPorter said the shutdown would also have consequences for people who use the internet to benefit from online health programmes.The security forces have arrested numerous suspected opponents of the coup.Myanmar Now new portal reported on Friday that five women who spoke to a visiting CNN news crew on the streets of Yangon this week had been taken away by security men.Separately, one person was shot and wounded in a raid in the second city of Mandalay on Friday night, the Mizzima news service said.The coup has also rekindled old wars with autonomy-seeking ethnic minority forces in the north and the east.Myanmar's oldest insurgent group, the Karen National Union (KNU), has seen the first military air strikes on its forces in more than 20 years since announcing its support for the pro-democracy movement.The KNU said more than 12,000 villagers had fled from their homes because of the air strikes and it called for an international embargo on arms sales to the military."Their inhuman actions against unarmed civilians have caused the death of many people including children and students," the group said in a statement.Media has reported that about 20 people were killed in air strikes in KNU territory in recent days, including nearly a dozen at a gold mine run by the group.The KNU signed a ceasefire with the government in 2012 to end their 60-year insurgency.Fighting has also flared in the north between the army and ethnic Kachin insurgents.The turmoil has sent several thousand refugees fleeing into Thailand and India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-junta-cracks-down-on-online-critics-death-toll-rises-to-550-101617423186720.html

US Capitol Police (USCP) identified the officer who lost his life in the attack as William “Billy” Evans and said the other was in stable and non-life-threatening condition. The attacker was shot dead by the police.Here’s what we know about the attack so far:1. The blue car rammed into the North Barricade just after 1pm (local) time at the complex in Washington, DC. Evans, one of the police officers to be attacked, joined the force in March 2003 and was a member of the First Responder’s Unit.Statement on the Loss of USCP Colleague Officer William "Billy" Evans: https://t.co/JMAEbTcbAp pic.twitter.com/DPvkAv5ptO2. The attacker came out of his vehicle after ramming it into the barricade and lunged at USCP officers with a knife, at which point he was shot by at least one officer. He was taken to the hospital but succumbed to his injuries around 1:30pm, the force said.3. Noah Green, a 25-year-old follower of the “Nation of Islam,” has been named as the suspected attacker. Green was from Indiana, and according to media reports, was unemployed and had health problems.4. Acting Metropolitan Police chief Robert Contee said that while an investigation into the incident was underway, the attack did not appear to be “terrorism-related.” Contee further said that investigators did not yet have a motive for the attack.5. The Capitol building was locked down as soon as the vehicle rammed into the barrier. The USCP later noted that “the external security threat incident” was cleared. However, the area around the crime scene would continue to be restricted, it further said.The USCP has cleared the external security threat incident located at all of the U.S. Capitol Campus buildings, however the area around the crime scene will continue to be restricted and individuals should follow police direction. pic.twitter.com/6SXr5WJmcE6.

03-04-2021||World||Third Covid-19 lockdown in France from today: All you need to know||French President Emmanuel Macron announced a third nationwide lockdown beginning Saturday in view of the surging cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). The decision was taken amid heavy criticism from other European countries which said France decided to not go under a third lockdown in early January despite being severely hit by the virus, unlike them.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageThe lockdown aims to stem the Covid-19 crisis and ease pressure on hospitals in hotspots that are left overwhelmed due to the new surge. In a televised address to the nation, Macron also stressed the need to vaccinate everyone faster. "We will do everything to vaccinate, vaccinate, vaccinate! Without rest, without holidays. Saturday and Sunday just like in the week," he said.France on Friday reported 46,677 new cases, which were 6.2% more than a week ago, taking the total to 4.74 million cases. It also reported 332 new deaths from Covid-19, taking the toll to 96,280.Here is all you need to know about the new restrictions:1. As a result of the lockdown, non-essential shops around the country will be closed for the next four weeks.2. Schools will be shut but university students will still be allowed to attend classes one day a week. 3. Outdoor activities will be limited to places within six miles of people’s home.4. Alcoholic drinks will be banned in parks and other outdoor public spaces.5. Macron, however, did not put a total prohibition on people socialising and authorised travel between regions over the Easter weekend.6. If one needs to travel during curfew hours from 7pm to 6am, or for trips exceeding 10 kilometres, a certificate will be required, Macron told citizens in his Wednesday address.7. An order to set up thousands of temporary ICU beds in hospitals reeling under pressure was also passed and parliament approved it on Thursday, according to news agency AP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/third-covid-19-lockdown-in-france-from-today-all-you-need-to-know-101617413228348.html
03-04-2021||World||California allows indoor events as Covid-19 cases near record low||California on Friday cleared the way for people to attend indoor concerts, theater performances and NBA games for the first time in more than a year as the rate of people testing positive for the coronavirus in the state nears a record low.State officials won't require testing or proof of vaccination for some of those events, but they do limit the number of people allowed to attend. Events that do require testing and vaccinations will be allowed to have more paying customers than those that don’t. Only people who live in California can attend these live performances.The rules are different for private indoor gatherings, including weddings, meetings or conferences. Those are only to be allowed if all guests test negative for the coronavirus at least 72 hours in advance or show proof of full vaccination. The changes do not mention requiring proof of vaccination and put much of the enforcement on business owners and operators.“Allowing some of these activities and opportunities to vaccinated individuals is an incentive,” said Dee Dee Myers, director of the Governor's Office of Business and Economic Development. “If they can return to some of their favorite activities because they're vaccinated then hopefully a few more people will go and get vaccinated.”The new rules seem to nudge California toward a system of vaccine verification, a hotly debated issue across the country. New York has launched a digital pass residents can use to show proof of vaccination or a negative COVID-19 test that is accepted at major entertainment venues. But Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis issued an executive order on Friday banning businesses from requiring so-called “vaccine passports.”President Joe Biden's administration has said the federal government won't come up with a national vaccine passport app, leaving that to the private sector. But the federal government is devising regulations for how and when those passports can be used.California Public Health Officer Dr. Tomás Aragón said Friday the state will follow the federal government's lead but said vaccinations won't be required for essential services.California's new rules come as the state has administered nearly 19 million doses of the COVID-19 vaccines. Nearly 6.9 million people are fully vaccinated in a state with close to 40 million residents. Only people 50 and over are eligible statewide to get the vaccine now, followed by those 16 and older on April 15.Requiring proof of vaccination prompts questions of privacy and equity as not everyone will be able to get a vaccine while others would not want their medical information stored in a clearinghouse, said Dr. Kirsten Bibbins-Domingo, chair of the Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics at the University of California-San Francisco.She noted that similar requirements in other countries have prompted people to get vaccinated, but the most notable problem in California is “we just haven't simply vaccinated enough people in the population right now,” she said. Surges in some parts of the country also suggest it's not a low-risk time to lift restrictions, she said.The new rules will continue to adhere to California's tier system, in which sectors of the economy can reopen depending on how widespread the virus is in each county.In the most restrictive purple tier, indoor concerts, sporting events and theater productions aren't allowed. In the red tier, venues of up to 1,500 people can operate at 10% and grow to 25% if all guests provide evidence of vaccination or a negative test. Venues of 1,501 people or more can operate at 20% capacity in the red tier, but must show proof of vaccination or a negative test. Capacity increases for tiers where the virus is less widespread.Venues can also choose to separate people into sections based on their vaccination status. Those who are fully vaccinated could sit shoulder-to-shoulder but they still must wear masks, Aragón said.Ben Bleiman, a San Francisco nightlife activist and chairman of the California Music and Culture Association, said venues need full capacity to make any money — but members will take the change, albeit with some trepidation.“On the one side you have the thrill and the joy of reopening," he said, adding on the other, “there’s some dread that something's going to go wrong.”Private indoor events, including wedding receptions and conventions, are not allowed in the purple tier. In the red tier, they are limited to 100 people and all guests must show proof of either a negative test or that they have been fully vaccinated. More people can attend such events in less restrictive tiers.Most of California's 58 counties are in the red tier, but big population centers like San Francisco, Santa Clara County and Los Angeles County are in the less restrictive orange tier. Just two counties are in the lowest yellow tier.Those capacity limits for private gatherings likely won't help large convention centers, which rely on indoor events that attract thousands of people.Ray Roa, director of sales and marketing for the Fresno Convention & Entertainment Center, said the updates are a step in the right direction, but officials need guidance on how to hold large-scale meetings and events like the ones his venue typically hosts.Gov. Gavin Newsom visited a San Diego vaccination site Friday to highlight California's vaccination efforts. Newsom, 53, got vaccinated on Thursday, the first day California allowed anyone 50 and older to get a shot.“We’re not going to get to herd immunity, we’re not going to get back to that semblance of normalcy unless we get more people vaccinated," Newsom said.___Har reported from San Francisco.___This story has been corrected to show private indoor gatherings in the red tier are limited to 100 people, not 50 people, and to clarify that California won’t require testing or proof of vaccination for many, but not all events.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/california-allows-indoor-events-as-covid-19-cases-near-record-low-101617411055525.html

Parents will be allowed to bring babies and very young children, allowing some people the chance to meet the newest members of their family for the first time."I’m particularly pleased to allow residents to have more visitors, including grandchildren, given the isolation and concern felt by so many this past year," Prime Minister Boris Johnson said in a statement.Visitors will have to wear personal protective equipment and provide a negative COVID test result.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-to-ease-curbs-to-allow-care-home-residents-meet-2-visitors-says-pm-johnson-101617408743527.html
03-04-2021||World||Joe Biden 'heartbroken' over deadly attack at US Capitol||A US Capitol police officer was killed and a second injured Friday after a vehicle rammed through security and crashed into a barrier at the Washington complex, forcing it into lockdown less than three months after a mob assault on Congress.Capitol Police shot dead the driver after he jumped out of the car and lunged at them with a knife, Acting Chief Yogananda Pittman told reporters.President Joe Biden, who was with First Lady Jill Biden at Camp David for the Easter holiday, offered his "heartfelt condolences" to the family of William Evans, the veteran policeman killed in the attack."Jill and I were heartbroken to learn of the violent attack at a security checkpoint on the US Capitol grounds," Biden said in a statement.US media said officials had identified the attacker as Noah Green, a 25-year-old Black man from Indiana and an adherent of the black nationalist Nation of Islam movement.Pittman said there was no immediate indication of his motivation or police file on him."It does not appear to be terrorism-related, but obviously we will continue to investigate," Washington Metropolitan Police Chief Robert Contee added.Some of Green's online postings in March suggested a level of despair and paranoia. He said he was unemployed and had health problems, and made references to biblical concepts of the end of times.He wrote that he had faced "unimaginable tests" and was now "in search of a spiritual journey."In one post he spoke of being tormented by the FBI and CIA, hospitalized and subjected to "mind control," and called the government "the #1 enemy of Black people!"He was also said he was a follower of Louis Farrakhan, the leader of the Nation of Islam, who promotes Black nationalist, anti-white and anti-Semitic thinking.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-heartbroken-over-deadly-attack-at-us-capitol-101617408462966.html

Its selling price far exceeded the $114,000 that another unopened copy that was produced in 1987 fetched in a Heritage auction last summer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/unopened-super-mario-bros-game-from-1986-sells-for-660000-101617400099370.html
03-04-2021||World||US reaches 100 million with vaccines as Europe faces hiccups||The United States reaped the fruits Friday of its vaccination campaign against Covid-19 as it became the first nation to reach 100 million people, but Europe's rollout faced fresh impediments and South America tightened restrictions in the face of Brazil's soaring infections.The United States reported surging job growth and loosened travel curbs as it reached around half of its adult population with at least one dose, with President Joe Biden vowing to cover the vast majority within weeks.Led by a revival in the leisure and hospitality industries, the US economy created a mammoth 916,000 jobs in March, the Labor Department said.But infections remain on the rise in parts of the United States, prompting Biden to urge Americans to keep wearing masks and taking other precautions to stop the pandemic that has killed more than 2.8 million people worldwide."I plead with you. Don't give back the progress we've all fought so hard to achieve," Biden said in a brief address."We need to finish this job," he said. "We need every American to buckle down and keep their guard up in this homestretch."The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, meanwhile, updated guidance to say that fully vaccinated people can travel without observing quarantines, although they should still wear masks.The United States has suffered a catastrophic Covid toll at more than 550,000 people dead, with health measures polarizing the country since last year when Biden's predecessor Donald Trump criticized restrictions.New woes in EuropeEuropean nations have been struggling to speed up vaccination and several have returned to unpopular lockdowns, with France banning outdoor gatherings of more than six people.Some of Europe's vaccination woes come from its reliance on the AstraZeneca jab, yet to be approved in the United States, after reports of blood clotting.Such incidents are rare and the European Medicines Agency has said AstraZeneca is safe. But the Netherlands on Friday followed Germany in halting jabs of the vaccine for people under the age of 60."We must err on the side of caution, which is why it is wise to press the pause button now as a precaution," Dutch Health Minister Hugo de Jonge said.Only 10 percent of Europe's total population has received one vaccine dose, and four percent have received two, according to the World Health Organization.The WHO director for Europe, Hans Kluge, on Thursday called the rollout "unacceptably slow."Also complicating vaccination efforts is that India, often dubbed the "pharmacy of the world," has slowed down exports as it battles a major surge.India has been ramping up vaccinations, expanding eligibility to everyone over age 45.But on Friday the country reported 81,000 daily infections and 469 deaths, the highest since October.Among those contracting Covid-19 was cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar, who checked into a Mumbai hospital as a precaution but said he hoped to return home within days.China -- where the pulmonary disease first emerged in 2019 in circumstances that remain a topic of intense speculation -- as well as Russia have stepped up exports of their own vaccines.Chinese biopharmaceutical firm Sinovac said it will double capacity to produce its vaccine to two billion doses a year.Growing worries over BrazilOne of the worst Covid crises in the world is unfolding in Brazil, which has reported more deaths than any country after the United States with a staggering 66,500 Covid-19 fatalities in March alone.Latin America's infections have soared past 25 million, according to an AFP tally, likely fueled by a seemingly more contagious variant first detected in Brazil.Rio de Janeiro on Friday extended restrictions, saying that hospitalizations had started to level off for the first time in weeks."You have to give a little more time, no matter how hard it is for companies and for those looking for work to earn a living. These decreases in people-to-people contact are already paying off," Mayor Eduardo Paes told reporters.The city's famous beaches will remain off limits until April 19, when a daily nighttime curfew will also be lifted.But he said that schools would reopen for in-person classes Tuesday.The devastation in Brazil has frightened neighbors already battling their own surging caseloads. Peru and Ecuador announced fresh restrictions and Bolivia sealed the Brazilian border."We are in a very critical moment of the pandemic," Chilean government spokesman Jaime Bellolio said as he announced a closure of borders starting Monday.Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, a far-right ally of Trump, has dismissed the dangers of the virus and aired conspiracy theories, with the country's military chiefs and top ministers exiting in recent days amid the turmoil.At a field hospital in the suburbs of Sao Paulo, one doctor said she was alarmed at the spread of the virus -- and frustrated to see many of her compatriots ignore face masks, shun social distancing guidelines and even flood to underground parties."I see no difference in people's behavior. People don't seem to understand the magnitude of this," said 53-year-old surgeon Marise Gomes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-reaches-100-million-with-vaccines-as-europe-faces-hiccups-101617399951638.html
03-04-2021||World||Biden lifts Trump sanctions on international court officials||President Joe Biden on Friday lifted sanctions that Donald Trump had imposed on two top officials of the International Criminal Court, undoing one of the past administration's more aggressive moves targeting international institutions and officials.Secretary of State Antony Blinken in a statement stressed that the United States still strongly disagreed with some actions by the court, which is a standing body based at The Hague in the Netherlands charged with handling genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. The United States is not one of the about 120 member countries of the court.“We believe, however, that our concerns about these cases would be better addressed” through diplomacy “rather than through the imposition of sanctions," Blinken wrote.The removal of the sanctions was the latest signal that the Biden administration is intent on returning to the multilateral fold. The Trump administration had unapologetically removed the United States from numerous international institutions and agreements and harshly criticised others, including the ICC, deeming them flawed and working against American interests.Since Biden took office, his administration has rejoined the World Health Organization, re-engaged with the U.N. Human Rights Council, returned to the Paris climate accord and on Friday started talks aimed at returning to the Iran nuclear deal. Trump had pulled out of all five.The court was created to hold accountable perpetrators of war crimes and crimes against humanity in cases where adequate judicial systems were not available. The U.S. has not joined the ICC, which began operations in 2002 after enough countries ratified the treaty that created it, because of concerns the court might be used for politically motivated prosecutions of American troops and officials.Rights groups on Friday applauded Biden for throwing out Trump's sanctions — Amnesty International called those an “act of vandalism” against international justice — but called for Biden to go further, by supporting the court's work and making the United States a member country.The US sanctions had targeted ICC chief prosecutor Fatou Bensouda and the court's head of jurisdiction, Phakiso Mochochoko, for pressing ahead with investigations into the United States and its allies, notably Israel, for alleged war crimes. Two sets of sanctions were imposed, the first being a travel ban on Bensouda in March 2019, and then 18 months later a freeze on any assets she and Mochochoko may have in the United States or U.S. jurisdictions. The second round also made giving the pair “material support” a potentially sanctionable offense.Both sets of sanctions had been roundly denounced by the ICC itself as well as a number of court members and human rights groups. When former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo imposed the financial penalties in September 2020, he attacked the court as “a thoroughly broken and corrupt institution” and said “we will not tolerate its illegitimate attempts to subject Americans to its jurisdiction.”US presidents since Bill Clinton have expressed deep reservations about the court, although some, including President Barack Obama, agreed to limited cooperation with it.The Trump administration, however, was openly hostile to the tribunal and lashed out at Bensouda and others for pursuing prosecutions of Americans for actions in Afghanistan and Israelis for actions against the Palestinians. Israel is not a member of the ICC and, along with the U.S., rejects Palestinian membership because it is not a state.Blinken said the United States sees accountability for atrocities as a national security interest, and pointed to U.S. support for other, often temporary, tribunals globally.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-lifts-trump-sanctions-on-international-court-officials-101617399789545.html
03-04-2021||World||US, Iran hope to salvage Nuclear deal in Vienna||The United States and Iran said on Friday they would start indirect talks with other major world powers next week to try to get both countries back into an accord limiting Iran’s nuclear programme, nearly three years after former president Donald Trump pulled the US out of the deal.US state department spokesperson Ned Price called the resumption of negotiations, scheduled for Tuesday in Vienna, “a healthy step forward”.But Price added, “These remain early days, and we don’t anticipate an immediate breakthrough as there will be difficult discussions ahead.”Trump pulled the United States out of the Iran Nuclear Deal in 2018, and US President Joe Biden has said rejoining the agreement is a priority for his administration.The Biden administration and Iran have differed on any conditions for that to happen, including the timing of the lifting of US sanctions against Iran, and the stalemate on those points had threatened to pose a major foreign policy setback for the new Biden administration.Agreement on the start of multi-party talks - being held to get Iran and the United States over their differences on conditions for returning to the 2015 nuclear deal - came after talks on Thursday brokered by other governments that have remained in the accord, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). Price said next week’s talks will be structured around working groups that the European Union was forming with the remaining participants in the accord, including Iran.“The primary issues that will be discussed are the nuclear steps that Iran would need to take in order to return to compliance with the terms of the JCPOA, and the sanctions relief steps that the United States would need to take in order to return to compliance as well,” Price said. The US, like Iran, said that it did not anticipate direct talks between America and Iran now. Price said Washington, DC remains open to that idea, however.Iranian foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif immediately stressed that no meeting was planned between officials from Iran and the US.In a tweet, Zarif said the aim of the Vienna session would be to “rapidly finalise sanction-lifting & nuclear measures for choreographed removal of all sanctions, followed by Iran ceasing remedial measures”.Iranian state television quoted Abbas Araghchi, Iran’s nuclear negotiator, as saying during Friday’s discussions that any “return by the US to the nuclear deal does not require any negotiation and the path is quite clear”.“The US can return to the deal and stop breaching the law in the same way it withdrew from the deal and imposed illegal sanctions on Iran,” Araghchi was quoted as saying.Russia’s ambassador to international organisations in Vienna, Mikhail Ulyanov, said that “the impression is that we are on the right track, but the way ahead will not be easy and will require intensive efforts”.Iran has been slowly but steadily violating the restrictions of the 2015 deal.Tehran’s moves have been calculated to put pressure on the other nations in the deal - Russia, China, France, Germany and Britain - to do more to offset crippling sanctions reimposed under Trump.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-iran-hope-to-salvage-nuclear-deal-in-vienna-101617399452774.html
03-04-2021||World||UK MPs say Covid passports backed by Boris are divisive||A group of British lawmakers on Friday warned ministers against introducing “divisive and discriminatory” Covid-19 vaccine passports after UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson backed the scheme.The group of more than 70 MPs - including former leaders of both the main parties - warned that vaccine passports could be used to “deny individuals access to general services, businesses or jobs”.They spoke out after the UK PM on Thursday said the documents would be “useful” adding that “there’s definitely going to be a world in which international travel will use vaccine passports”.The Daily Telegraph reported on Friday that virus passports could be trialled at the FA Cup final football match in May and the World Snooker Championship starting this month.Earlier this week, Keir Starmer, leader of the opposition Labour Party, said if virus deaths and hospital admissions fall very low, “the British instinct... will be against vaccine passports”.The concept has won support internationally, particularly from countries dependent on tourism. The EU has proposed a digital European vaccine pass. Greece and Cyprus already have vaccination passports specifically for travel to and from Israel, which has fully vaccinated over 55% of its population.The UK government, meanwhile, is adding four countries - Bangladesh, Kenya, Pakistan and the Philippines - to its travel ban list amid concerns over new variants of the coronavirus. The latest restrictions will take effect in England on April 9.In China, the border city of Ruili, hit by a fresh outbreak, began a five-day drive on Friday to vaccinate its entire population of 300,000 people.In Italy, police seized devices allegedly used by four Italians to send death threats and offensive emails to the country’s health minister Roberto Speranza to protest his firm stance on coronavirus lockdowns.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-mps-say-covid-passports-backed-by-boris-are-divisive-101617393220437.html
03-04-2021||World||Capitol police officer killed after man rammed car at checkpoint||US Capitol Police shot and killed a man who rammed a car into a security checkpoint outside the Capitol building on Friday, injuring one officer and killing another, acting Chief Yogananda Pittman said.The unidentified man stepped out of the vehicle armed with a knife and was shot by police, a Capitol official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. The suspect died shortly after, Pittman said.The two officers were hospitalised and Pittman said “it is with very heavy heart one of the officers has succumbed to his injuries.”At this time it does not appear to be an ongoing threat,” said Robert Contee, chief of Washington metro police. “It does not appear to be terrorism related.” He said the investigation is continuing.Video footage from the scene showed that the car had been driving fast enough for the airbag to deploy when it hit the security barricade.The authorities said in a statement that the incident occurred at a “vehicle access point” on the Senate side of the Capitol along Constitution Avenue in Washington D.C.“A suspect is in custody. Both officers are injured. All three have been transported to the hospital,” the police said in a tweet.The Capitol was on security lockdown, with no one allowed to enter or exit buildings, but they are allowed to move within the campus of buildings.The Capitol has been under heavy security since the Jan. 6 attack on the building by supporters of former President Donald Trump while Congress was voting to certify the 2020 election in Joe Biden’s favor. Some perimeter fencing has since been removed, but not all of it.Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell tweeted that he was “praying for the United States Capitol Police officers” and “grateful” to first responders on the scene.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/capitol-police-officer-killed-after-man-rammed-car-at-checkpoint-101617390404349.html
03-04-2021||World||US Capitol on lockdown after car rams barricade, injuring 2 officers; driver shot||A man rammed a car into two Capitol Police officers at a barricade outside the US Capitol on Friday afternoon before being shot to death by authorities when he got out of the vehicle while holding what appeared to be a knife, two law enforcement officials told The Associated Press.Both Capitol Police officers were taken to the hospital, with at least one in serious condition, the officials said. The suspect died at a hospital.The crash and shooting happened at a security checkpoint near the Capitol as Congress is on recess. It comes as the Washington region remains on edge nearly three months after a mob of armed insurrectionists stormed the Capitol as Congress was voting to certify Joe Biden’s presidential win.Five people died in the Jan. 6 riot, including Capitol Police officer Brian Sicknick, who was among a badly outnumbered force trying to fight off insurrectionists who supported former President Donald Trump's bid to overturn the election. Authorities installed a tall perimeter fence around the Capitol and for months restricted traffic along the roads closest to the building, but they have begun pulling back some of the emergency measures in recent weeks.While there was no immediate connection apparent between Jan. 6 and Friday, the incident underscores that the building and campus remain potential targets for violence. It occurred about 100 yards (91 meters) from the entrance of the building on the Senate side of the Capitol.The security checkpoint is typically used by senators and staff on weekdays, but lawmakers are away for recess. Fencing that prevented vehicular traffic near that area was recently removed.Capitol Police said that someone rammed a vehicle into two of its officers. The law enforcement officials told the AP that the driver then got out of the car with what appeared to be a knife. It's unclear which member of law enforcement shot the suspect.The officials initially said the suspect was being taken to the hospital in critical condition. One of the officers who was injured was taken by police car to the hospital; the other was being transported by emergency medical crews, the officials said.The officials could not discuss the matter publicly and spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity.The US Capitol complex was placed on lockdown after the shooting and staff were told they could not enter or exit buildings. Video showed National Guard troops mobilizing near the area of the crash.Video posted online showed a dark colored sedan crashed against a vehicle barrier and a police K-9 inspecting the vehicle. Law enforcement and paramedics could be seen caring for at least one unidentified individual.President Biden had just departed the White House for Camp David when the incident occurred. As customary, he was traveling with a member of the National Security Council Staff who was expected to brief him on the incident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-capitol-complex-on-lockdown-after-report-of-gunshots-nearby-101617384683470.html

It was recorded by some TMC party workers. We want her to get back to normal life soon, we also pray for that... but she must stop putting up this drama by moving around in a wheelchair."If she was exercising her leg by shaking it then I suggest that she start walking as that will help her recuperate faster."Taking a jibe at the chief minister, Rahul Sinha, a senior leader of the saffron party, said the TMC supremo's bandage will not buy her votes."The more she is losing confidence the bigger her bandage gets. People are not buying this... She must have forgotten which leg is injured, and shook the wrong foot. She has already lost the elections, the bandage won't be able to save her from imminent defeat," Sinha said.Taking strong exception to the remarks made by BJP leaders, state minister Shashi Panja said the saffron camp, by raising suspicion over Banerjee's injuries, has not just insulted her but all the women of Bengal."We condemn the manner the BJP is insulting our beloved CM. They are not just insulting our CM, but also the other women of the state. We urge them to show proper respect to the women of this state," Panja said.Echoing her, former BJP leader Yashwant Sinha, who joined the TMC recently, said if anybody was churning out lies, it was the BJP and not the TMC."Are they (BJP leaders) trying to say that a whole lot of people involved (in treating her) including eminent doctors are lying? It's only the BJP which is capable of speaking such lies. I've no doubt in my mind that they are the ones behind this (propaganda)," Sinha, who had served as the finance minister in the Atal Bihari Vajpayee cabinet, stated.TMC spokesperson Kunal Ghosh also hit out at the BJP and said that the people of Bengal will give the BJP a befitting reply for its "dirty politics"."If they (BJP leaders) are spending so much time staring at Didi's feet, they might as well fall on her feet. We condemn such politics that targets a woman who is holding campaigns sitting on a wheelchair, after being attacked. This shows that the BJP has lost its plot," Ghosh said.Banerjee sustained injuries on her left leg, waist, shoulder and neck as she fell down after allegedly being pushed by miscreants in Nandigram on March 10.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mamata-seen-shaking-injured-leg-in-video-sparks-war-of-words-between-tmc-and-bjp-101617472748076.html

The sacrifices of the brave martyrs will never be forgotten. May the injured recover at the earliest,” Modi wrote on Twitter.PM Modi’s post came hours after five jawans were killed and 12 others were injured during a gunbattle between security forces and Maoists in the forests at the Bijapur and Sukma districts.“The encounter lasted about three hours inside the jungle. The injured were airlifted to Raipur and an operation was underway to evacuate the injured jawans and bodies from the forest through helicopters.

Bhushan directed all states and Union territories to immediately stop new registrations in the two categories on the CoWIN portal.“Various inputs have been received from different sources that in some of the CVCs (Covid Vaccination Centres) some ineligible beneficiaries are being registered as healthcare workers and frontline workers and are getting vaccinated in complete violation of the prescribed guidelines,” the letter read.As per Bhushan's letter to the states, there was a 24% increase in the database of the healthcare workers in the “past few days” on the portal.The decision was taken after a meeting of the National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for Covid-19 (NEGVAC) on Saturday.Also read: Covid-19 vaccination drive - Over 1.3 million doses given on SaturdayThe Covid-19 vaccination drive, which started on January 16, was to immunise 300 million healthcare workers, frontline workers, those over the age of 50 years with comorbidities in a phased manner. The first to receive the shots were 10 million healthcare workers. The drive opened up to 20 million frontline workers from February 1. People over the age of 60 years and those between the age group of 45 and 59 years with a combination of 20 specified comorbidities started receiving their shots from March 1. The drive was opened to all those over the age of 45 years from April 1.The vaccination drive for all healthcare workers was to end on February 25 and for the frontline workers on March 6. The registrations were closed as the drive was coming to an end. It was later re-opened once the vaccination for the elderly and those with comorbidities began in March to vaccinate those healthcare and frontline workers who couldn't get vaccinated previously.Although no new registrations for the two categories will happen on the government’s CoWIN portal, those who are already registered but haven’t taken the shot yet can still be immunised. “Universal vaccination of already registered healthcare workers and frontline workers should be ensured at the earliest,” Bhushan's letter read.As the number of Covid-19 cases continues to rise in the country, experts call for the opening up of the vaccination drive to everyone over the age of 18 years.“We should quickly vaccinate as many people over the age of 18 years. There is still a large proportion of the susceptible population that is leading to the second wave of the infection. So far, we have immunised around 7 crore people, which translates to about 5 to 6% of the population. With a 71% efficacy in preventing infections for the AstraZeneca vaccine, we have only about 4% of the population protected. And the majority is yet to receive the second dose of the vaccine,” said Dr GC Khilnani, former head of pulmonology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-don-t-register-more-healthcare-frontline-workers-for-coronavirus-vaccine-centre-tells-states-101617467864308.html
03-04-2021||India||Retired priests of Tirumala temple get back to service as TTD restores jobs||The Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams, which manages the country’s richest temple of Tirumala in Andhra Pradesh’s Chittoor district, on Saturday, issued orders restoring the services of several priests for the rest of their lives.The order restores the services of former head priest of the temple Dr AV Ramana Deekshitulu, who was forced to retire three years ago on attaining the age of superannuation at 65 years, a spokesperson of the TTD said. Deekshitulu confirmed to HT that he had received the orders and he would be taking over as the head priest of the temple again. “Along with me, at least 10 others of the Tirumala temple and other associated temples like Lord Padmavathi temple at Tiruchanur and Govindarajulu Swamy temple at Tirupati, have also got back their jobs,” he said. On May 16, 2018, the TTD, for the first time, introduced retirement rules for priests, according to which all those who attained the age of 65 years would have to retire. The rule was brought in at the TTD board meeting following serious allegations of corruption in the temple administration made by Deekshitulu the previous day. Deekshitulu then alleged that the administrators of the temple were siphoning off the temple money and destroying the sanctity of the temple and demanded an open audit into the donations being received by the temple and expenditure being incurred by the TTD. He also alleged that precious ancient jewellery of the temple was missing and demanded that the TTD be brought under the purview of the Right to Information Act. Along with Deekshitulu, three other priests – Narasimha Deekshitulu, Srinivasa Murthy Deekshitulu and Narayana Deekshitulu – were also forced to retire from their services. In their place, the TTD appointed four other priests. After the YSR Congress government came to power, chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy had done away with the rule of retirement for priests performing pujas in various Hindu temples across the state on attainment of age of superannuation, following a high court order of December 2018, which said the retirement rule would not be applicable to temple priests. The Jagan government issued an order in October 2019 stating that there would be no retirement for the priests of various temples on the basis of age. “A priest shall continue in the post till he is physically fit to perform his archakatvam (priesthood) duties,” the order said. However, the order was not made applicable to Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams, as it is governed by its own rules. As a result, Deekshitulu could not get back his head priest post. Instead, the TTD appointed him as Agama advisor and also honourary chief priest. Now, with Saturday’s orders, Deekshitulu will be re-joining his duties as head priest of the Tirumala temple. Of the remaining three main priests of the temple, Srinivasa Murthy died of Covid-19 on July 20 last year. The remaining two priests would also be getting back their jobs in the temple.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/retired-priests-of-tirumala-temple-get-back-to-service-as-ttd-restores-jobs-101617468248889.html

03-04-2021||India||Health minister Vardhan approves National Policy for Rare Diseases, 2021||Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan approved the 'National Policy for Rare Diseases 2021' which aims to lower the high cost of treatment for rare diseases, with increased focus on indigenous research and local production of medicines, an official statement said on Saturday.A provision for financial support up to ₹20 lakh under the Umbrella Scheme of Rastriya Arogya Nidhi is proposed for the treatment of those rare diseases that require a one-time treatment (diseases listed under Group 1 in the rare disease policy)."Beneficiaries for such financial assistance will not be limited to BPL families, but the benefit will be extended to about 40 per cent of the population who are eligible under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana," the health ministry said in the statement.The financial support for the treatment of rare diseases is proposed under the Umbrella Scheme of Rastriya Arogya Nidhi (RAN) and not under the Ayushman Bharat PMJAY, it stated.Besides, the policy also envisages a crowd funding mechanism in which corporates and individuals will be encouraged to extend financial support through a robust IT platform for the treatment of rare diseases.Funds so collected will be utilised by Centres of Excellence (CoEs) for treatment of all three categories of rare diseases as first charge and then the balance financial resources could also be used for research, the statement said.“Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan approved the 'National Policy for Rare Diseases 2021' on March 30," the ministry said."The Rare Diseases Policy aims to lower the high cost of treatment for rare diseases with increased focus on indigenous research with the help of a national consortium to be set up with the Department of Health Research, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare as convenor," it said.The policy also talks about the creation of national hospital based registry of rare diseases so that adequate data is available for definition of such diseases and for research and development related to rare diseases within the country, it said.It also focuses on early screening and prevention through primary and secondary health care infrastructure such as Health and Wellness Centres and District Early Intervention Centres (DEICs) and through counselling for high-risk patients, the ministry said.Screening will also be supported by Nidan Kendras set up by the Department of Biotechnology.The policy aims to strengthen tertiary health care facilities for prevention and treatment of rare diseases through designating eight health facilities as ‘Centres of Excellence’ and these will also be provided one-time financial support of up to ₹5 crore for upgradation of diagnostics facilities, it said.The Draft policy for Rare Diseases was put in public domain on January 13, 2020 on which comments/views were invited from stakeholders, general public, organisations and states and Union territories. All the comments received were examined in depth by an expert committee constituted by the health ministry.The field of rare diseases is very complex and heterogeneous, and the prevention, treatment and management of rare diseases has multiple challenges.There are also fundamental challenges in the research and development for the majority of rare diseases as relatively little is known about the pathophysiology or the natural history of these diseases, particularly in the Indian context, the statement said.Rare diseases are also difficult to research upon as the patients pool is very small and it often results in inadequate clinical experience. Availability and accessibility to medicines are also important to reduce morbidity and mortality associated with rare disease. Despite progress in recent years, there is a need to augment effective and safe treatment for rare diseases.The cost of treatment of rare diseases is prohibitively expensive. Various high courts and the Supreme Court have also expressed concern about lack of a national policy for rare diseases, the statement added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/health-minister-vardhan-approves-national-policy-for-rare-diseases-2021-101617463649930.html

Tamil Nadu, since March 5, has been witnessing a rise in fresh coronavirus cases and on April 2, the state had recorded 3,290 new infections, pushing the tally to 8,92,780 and deaths to 12,750.Chief secretary Rajeev Ranjan took part in a review meeting chaired by union cabinet secretary Rajiv Gauba along with senior officials on Friday.In an official release, Ranjan said the government was following all the steps as per the guidelines framed by the Centre towards controlling the spread of the virus.The impact of the virus was closely monitored on a daily basis and restrictions would be intensified as per the requirement, he said.Ranjan said the cabinet secretary during the review meeting issued necessary guidelines to 11 States which had reported a surge in new Covid-19 infections.Accordingly, it was decided in the meeting to bring down the Covid-19 positivity rate in states which had reported over 5 per cent.In Tamil Nadu, though the positivity rate has been below 5 per cent, it was decided to adopt 'increased and aggressive testing' in places which report higher Covid-19 infections.Steps are being taken to identify those people who were in contact with primary contacts and treat them in isolation if they had contracted the contagion, he said.Noting that residential complexes reporting more than three cases were declared as 'micro containment zones', he said till April 2 there were 846 such zones in the state.He said there was sufficient amount of beds, ventilators, medicines and personal protective equipment gear.To treat a Covid-19 patient without any delay, services of '108' ambulances was also utilised, he said,adding people should adhere to the COVID-19 protocol laid down by the government. Since March 16 the state has collected ₹2.58 crore as penalties from people violating the protocol.On vaccination, Ranjan said those eligible (above 45) should get vaccinated.Till April 2, as many as 31.75 lakh people, including healthcare and frontline workers besides those engaged in poll related works and above 45, were vaccinated.Tamil Nadu has received 54.74 lakh vaccine doses from the Centre as of today, he said.On deaths caused by the virus, Ranjan said measures were taken to ensure that Covid-19 fatalities remain less in Tamil Nadu.The government has issued a circular to both government and private run hospitals to follow the 'treatment procedures' as suggested by an expert committee, comprising medical experts from the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, towards reducing the deaths caused by Covid-19, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tn-to-intensify-covid-19-restrictions-based-on-requirement-to-contain-pandemic-chief-secretary-101617458323302.html
03-04-2021||India||₹26.50 lakh withdrawn from Sachin Vaze's joint account after arrest: NIA||The National Investigation Agency (NIA) has found that an amount of ₹26.50 lakh was withdrawn from the joint bank account of Sachin Vaze and his aide on March 18, five days after the Mumbai police officer was arrested for his alleged role in planting an explosives-laden SUV outside industrialist Mukesh Ambani's home on February 25, the court was told on Saturday.Without naming Vaze's accomplice, the National Investigation Agency said certain "incriminating material" was also taken out by someone from the joint locker of Waze and his aide, who is a suspect in the case, from a bank located in Versova area in Mumbai.The special court extended the custody of Vaze till April 7 after the investigating agency told the court that it had recovered "incriminating material" including laptops, DVRs (Digital Video Recorders), a CPU etc, in a damaged condition, during the probe and they need to be examined.The NIA is also probing the murder of Thane-based businessman Mansukh Hiran, the purported owner of the Scorpio SUV which was found parked near Ambani's south Mumbai residence 'Antilia'.The NIA told the court that Vaze was seen moving near the "scene of the crime" on March 4, a day before Hiran's body was found (in the creek in Mumbra in Thane district).The NIA told the court that a Mercedes car was seized on April 2.The agency had also recovered a diary from a club in south Mumbai mentioning that a huge amount had been paid to Vaze.The agency told the court it had found the passport of an unknown person at Vaze's house and needs his further custody to identify that person.Additional Solicitor General Anil Singh told the court Vaze held a joint bank account and a joint locker with his accomplice.The bank account had ₹26.50 lakh on the day of Vaze's arrest on March 13. However, the cash was found to be withdrawn on March 18, Singh told the court, adding that some "incriminating material" was also found to be taken out from the bank locker.Seeking Waze's custody for another six days, Singh said the NIA needs to trace the incriminating material that went missing from the bank locker and also wants to find out who was using the Mercedes car seized on April 2 and under whose instructions.Some incriminating material was also seized during the search conducted at the house of former policeman and co- accused Vinayak Shinde, Singh said, adding the NIA will confront Waze with the recovered evidence.The NIA also needs to examine the CCTV footage data it had seized during the investigation and needs to confront Vaze and other accused with it.Opposing the NIA's plea, Vaze's lawyer Abad Ponda said the NIA can seek remand of the accused under the provisions of the Unlawful Activities Prevention (UAPA) Act after the lapse of 15 days.However, the NIA has not mentioned a single ground seeking the extension of Waze's custody under the UAPA in its remand application, he said.Ponda rejected the NIA's contention that Vaze held a joint account in the bank in Versova.He demanded that the NIA show the bank account opening form with the name and signature of the accused,which the agency rejected.Referring to the recovery of electronic devices from the Mithi river in Mumbai by the NIA, Ponda said as it is a huge river, anyone can dump anything into it.He said the NIA had planted these devices into the river, which it later showed as being recovered during the investigation.He said Vaze had nothing to do with these materials recovered by the NIA."The recovery is based on their skill and volition and completely foisted upon me (Waze)," Ponda added. Meanwhile, Vaze told the court that he was suffering from some cardiac issues and had suffered a stroke on Sunday.Vaze had demanded his examination by a cardiologist.Vaze's lawyer submitted in court that the police officer has a blockage in his heart that can be treated only by angiography and angioplasty.However, the NIA said they had run diagnostics and found that Vaze's heart was functioning normally."We did ECG and blood test, 2D Echo..His heart is working normally. Doctors had advised him a bypass (surgery) in 2019, but he didn't do it then," the NIA said, adding Waze was being provided the required treatment and that his health was being monitored.The court then directed the NIA to submit a detailed report on the next day on whether Vaze needs a specific treatment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rs-26-50-lakh-withdrawn-from-sachin-vaze-s-joint-account-after-arrest-nia-101617457373230.html

The party, in a strongly worded tweet in Hindi, called the poll body a “participant in the attack on the country’s democracy and constitution.”“The role of Election Commission of India is to be impartial. But it appears questionable and on the side of the authority. To reduce the duration of the ban imposed on the BJP leader [Himanta Biswa Sarma] is condemnable. The ECI is also a participant in the attack on the country’s democracy and constitution,” Congress tweeted, with a picture of the ECI’s order.भारतीय चुनाव आयोग की भूमिका निष्पक्ष होनी चाहिए। लेकिन चुनाव आयोग की भूमिका संदिग्ध है, सत्ता के पक्ष में है। भाजपा नेता पर लगाए गए बैन की अवधि कम करना निंदनीय है।देश के लोकतंत्र और संविधान पर हमले में भारतीय चुनाव आयोग भी भागीदार है। pic.twitter.com/7PacMRW9WaAlso read | EC accepts Himanta Biswa Sarma’s plea, reduces ban on his campaign ralliesSupporting his party’s stance, Congress general secretary Randeep Singh Surjewala also made similar comments regarding the issue.“A dark day for Parliamentary democracy. #ECI doesn’t even have the guts to sustain its own order. Deplorable that EC buckles under Modi Govt’s pressure & reverses its own order of ban on Sh. Himanta Biswa Sarma.

Was this somersault taken suo moto or on a fresh plea by BJP/Himanta Sarma? 2. If yes, why did EC then not call upon the complainant, BPF & Congress? 3. If no, why this vexatious change of heart? 4. Does it now give a license to issue threat with impunity?” he asked.Earlier on Friday, ECI banned Sarma from campaigning in Assam for a 48-hour duration following a complaint by the Congress on March 30 saying that he threatened Hagrama Mohilary, chief of the Bodoland People’s Front (BPF), with imprisonment. The duration of the ban was curtailed to 24 hours on Saturday.With the campaigning for the third and final phase of the Assam assembly elections set to end on April 4, Sarma has only the last day left for his campaign with the ECI’s new decision. As much as 40 assembly constituencies in Assam would go to polls during the final phase scheduled for April 6.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ecis-role-questionable-congress-on-poll-body-s-decision-to-reduce-campaign-ban-on-himanta-biswa-sarma-101617456842301.html

Pranab Kumar Gogoi, who hails from Assam, was recovered by police in Changlang district in Arunachal Pradesh. However, there is no trace yet of Ram Kumar, another employee of the company who hails from Bihar and was abducted along with Gogoi. “We found Gogoi from Longbi village along the Indo-Myanmar border on the Indian side. He is healthy and seems to be fit. We are questioning him. There is no trace of Ram Kumar,” Mihin Gambo, superintendent of police, Changlang, said. Gogoi, a drilling superintendent, and Ram Kumar, a radio operator, employed by Quippo Oil and Gas Infrastructure Limited, a Delhi-based company, were abducted on December 21 from a drilling location in Changlang district. “It’s like a new life for me. Every day in custody was spent on worrying whether I would see the next sunrise. We were shifted every 2-3 days and kept at different locations,” Gogoi told journalists after his release. “Both Kumar and I were kept together till March 4. But we were separated after that and I have no clue about his whereabouts. I hope he is also released soon,” he added. On January 12, Paresh Baruah, commander-in-chief of ULFA-I had admitted to abducting the two employees and told TV channels in Assam that Kumar, who hails from Bihar, would become a ‘victim’ if the oil drilling company didn’t pay the outfit it’s ‘due share’ for extracting natural resources from Assam and rest of the northeast region. Baruah had said that Gogoi who’s an Assamese won’t be harmed. Later, ULFA-I had set a deadline till February 16 to complete talks and secure the release of the two abducted employees. It had also warned that chief ministers of Assam and Arunachal Pradesh would be responsible if the two employees die in an “undesired incident”. In February this year, ULFA-I threatened to take ‘final action’ on Gogoi and Kumar in a phased manner since the deadline for talks as well as discussions with the company had passed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/103-days-after-abduction-ulfa-i-releases-assam-man-no-trace-of-another-from-bihar-101617452407856.html

It's their (BJP's) youth wing. They were saying, "Rakesh Tikait, Go Back". Where should I go? They hurled stones, used lathis," said Tikait."Why are they fighting us, we're farmers, we are not a political party," he added.When asked about the possibility of a dialogue between farmers and the Centre, the BKU leader said, "If the government was run by a party, then dialogue would have concluded by now. This government is run by companies (Corporates). They only look at their business and profit. They don't care about anyone. They will profit more if there are more hungry people in the country."The convoy of Tikait was allegedly attacked at Tatarpur Chowk in Alwar on Friday. According to police, four persons have been detained in connection with the incident.After the incident, Tikait said that goons of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) tried to attack him. He tweeted in Hindi, "Tatarpur intersection of Alwar district of Rajasthan near Bansur road --- attacked by BJP goons --killing our democracy."Following the attack, the BKU chief's supporters blocked National Highway 9 at the Ghazipur border. The Highway was opened for traffic movement later on.Farmers have been protesting at the different borders of Delhi since November last year against the three farm laws -- Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; the Farmers Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rakesh-tikait-claims-bjp-s-youth-wing-responsible-for-attack-on-convoy-101617447397125.html

He had also hinted that a lockdown was inevitable if new cases continue to go up."....This is irresponsible behaviour. Fadnavis should have given information on the aid provided by the Central government to Maharashtra. For the last year, the state has been battling pandemic and natural disasters like cyclones, floods and heavy rains on its own. The MVA government is working hard to mitigate the hardships of the people."However, the Centre had acted out of bias against the state by not parting the rightful share of funds to the state. Instead of contributing to the Chief Minister's relief fund, BJP leaders had donated to the PM Cares Fund for Covid-19. What has the state got from the ₹20 lakh crore ('aatmanirbhar') package," Patole asked.He alleged the Centre used federal investigating agencies to malign the image of Maharashtra."The unplanned lockdown last year had pushed the country on the brink of the economic crisis," the Congress leader said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-withheld-funds-meant-for-maharashtra-out-of-bias-congress-101617447193006.html

03-04-2021||India||ISRO espionage case: SC-appointed probe panel submits report on Nambi Narayanan's illegal arrest||A high-level probe panel appointed by the Supreme Court to take erring cops to task for causing "tremendous harassment" and "immeasurable anguish" to ISRO scientist Dr Nambi Narayanan in the 1994 espionage case has submitted its report to the apex court, sources said.The SC had on September 14, 2018 appointed the three-member panel headed by its former judge D K Jain while directing the Kerala government to cough up ₹50 lakh compensation for compelling Narayanan to undergo "immense humiliation".The scientist was arrested when the Congress was heading the government in Kerala. The panel, after investigation, submitted its report in a sealed cover to the apex court recently.The CBI, in its probe, had held that the then top police officials in Kerala were responsible for Narayanan's illegal arrest.The case also had its political fallout, with a section in the Congress targeting the then Chief Minister late K Karunakaran over the issue, that eventually led to his resignation.Over a period of almost two-and-a-half years, the panel headed by Justice Jain examined the circumstances leading to the arrest.The espionage case, which had hit the headlines in 1994, pertained to allegations of transfer of certain confidential documents on India's space programme to foreign countries by two scientists and four others, including two Maldivian women.The 79-year-old former scientist, who was given a clean chit by the CBI, maintained that the Kerala Police had "fabricated" the case and the technology he was accused to have stolen and sold in the 1994 case did not even exist at that time.Narayanan had approached the apex court against a Kerala High Court judgement that said "no action needed to be taken" against former DGP Siby Mathews, who was then heading the SIT probe team, two retired superintendents of police, K K Joshua and S Vijayan, and the then Deputy Director, Intelligence Bureau, R B Shreekumar, who were later held responsible by the CBI for the scientist's illegal arrest.The apex court in its judgement had said, "We think that the obtaining factual scenario calls for constitution of a committee to find out ways and means to take appropriate steps against the erring officials.""The criminal law was set in motion without any basis. It was initiated, if one is allowed to say, on some kind of fancy or notion," a bench headed by the then Chief Justice Dipak Misra had said."We are of the view that the appellant was arrested and he has suffered custody for almost 50 days. His arrest has been seriously criticised in the closure report of the CBI. From the aforesaid report, the harassment and mental torture faced by the appellant is obvious," the bench had added.The judgement had said the "entire prosecution" initiated by the state police was "malicious and it has caused tremendous harassment and immeasurable anguish" to Narayanan. "It can be stated with certitude" that the fundamental right of life and personal liberty of Narayanan was "gravely affected".The CBI, while giving a clean chit to the scientist, had said that Siby Mathews had left "the entire investigation to IB surrendering his duties" and ordered indiscriminate arrest of the scientist and others without adequate evidence.The case had caught attention in October 1994, when Maldivian national Rasheeda was arrested in Thiruvananthapuram for allegedly obtaining secret drawings of ISRO rocket engines to sell to Pakistan.Narayanan, the then director of the cryogenic project at ISRO, was arrested along with the then ISRO Deputy Director D Sasikumaran, and Fousiya Hasan, a Maldivian friend of Rasheeda.The apex court had termed the police action against the ex-scientist of the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) a "psycho-pathological treatment".It had said that his "liberty and dignity", basic to his human rights, were jeopardised as he was taken into custody and, eventually, despite all the glory of the past, was compelled to face "cynical abhorrence".Awarding a compensation ₹50 lakh, which was to be paid by the state government, the top court had said it was being given to compensate for his suffering, anxiety and the treatment meted out to him.The apex court had said the "reputation of an individual is an insegregable facet of his right to life with dignity" and had rejected the plea of the Kerala government that due to the lapse of time, no inquiry or subsequent actions were needed to be taken against the erring officials.It had accepted Narayanan's plea that the authorities, who were responsible for causing such a "harrowing effect" on his mind, should face "legal consequences".The findings of the report are not yet known.

03-04-2021||India||Covid-19 second wave may peak in India by mid-April, say scientists||Using a mathematical model, scientists have predicted that the ongoing second wave of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) across India could peak by mid-April, after which it may see a decline by May end.A mathematical approach, named SUTRA, predicted last year that the initial spike of the coronavirus infection in August would rise by September and decrease in February this year.Manindra Agrawal, a scientist from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kanpur, applied the model to predict the trajectory of the current spike in coronavirus disease and found that the number of daily new infections is likely to peak in mid-April."For the last several days, we have found that there is a reasonable chance that the cases in India could peak sometime between 15-20 April. It is a sharp slope, but on the way down, it would likely be equally sharp, coming down very fast and by end of May may see a dramatic reduction," Agrawal told news agency PTI.He further said that there is some uncertainty in predicting the peak value of daily new infections because of the sharp rise. "Currently, it is coming to 1 lakh infections per day, but this can go up or down. But the timing remains the same between April 15-20," he added.Scientists have predicted that in the second wave of Covid-19, the first state to be affected could be Punjab in a few days, followed by Maharashtra.However, Agrawal added that the model's prediction of the new peak is sensitive to the daily new infections data. "Even a little bit of change each day causes the peak numbers to change by several thousand numbers. But the location of the peak has remained on mid-April," he said.Independent calculations made by scientists, including Gautam Menon from Ashoka University in Haryana, have also predicted that the surge of the second wave of Covid-19 infections could be between mid-April and mid-May."Any excessively precise prediction, of a peak within just a 5-day window, would ignore the many uncertainties associated with the inputs to any such calculation," Menon told PTI.Agrawal stated that the SUTRA model uses three main parameters to predict the course of the coronavirus pandemic. "The first is called Beta, or contact rate, which measures how many people an infected person infects per day. It is related to the R-naught value, which is the number of people an infected person spreads the virus to over the course of their infection," he added.He said the other two parameters are 'Reach', which is a measure of exposure level of the population to Covid-19 pandemic, and 'Epsilon' which is the ratio of detected and undetected coronavirus cases.Agrawal said, "The reason we had to introduce 'Reach' is that unlike earlier pandemics which start at a location and suddenly spread fast across a place, in Covid-19, the spread of the pandemic has been slower due to the many protective measures in place."He further said that 'Epsilon' helps factor in the number of asymptomatic infections across the nation. "Since the detected cases are quarantined, we assume they no longer contribute to new infections. So a growing number of daily new cases, reflect larger undetected infections. By measuring the number of new cases each day, we try to estimate the undetected and asymptomatic infections," he added.Agrawal said the SUTRA model relies on inputs from daily reported new infections, based on which the value of the three main parameters are deduced."We learn everything from the daily-infections data. The beta value across India has gone up by 50 per cent in March, which indicates that a combination of factors -- people becoming more relaxed, and more infectious variants going around. But precisely what reason this could be is something biologists have to say," he added.Agrawal said the model did not previously predict a second Covid-19 wave in India as it could have been due to a change in the parameters sometime between February and March this year. "So clearly during this time, some parameters had changed. So we had to wait for some time to collect new data and see how the parameters had changed, which we now know," he added.On Saturday, India recorded 89,129 new Covid-19 cases and 714 related deaths in the last 24 hours, according to the health ministry’s dashboard. With the new infections and fatalities, the country’s tally mounted to 12,392,260 and its death toll to 164,110, respectively.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/scientists-predict-2nd-wave-of-covid-19-in-india-by-midapril-101617441924456.html

The BKU further accused the government of deliberately delaying procurement and demanded that all the wheat being brought to the Mandi was immediately procured irrespective of the SMS criteria.Last year, the government agencies had roped-in commission agents to schedule farmers’ visit to Mandi for procurement. However, this year, it was decided that farmers will be allowed to approach Mandi for procurement as per the schedule messaged to them.“The government wants to delay the procurement and that is why they did not send SMSs to the farmers registered on the Meri Fasal Mera Bayora (My crop, my detail) portal,” said Jadgip Singh Aulakh, a local BKU leader.He said that the government agencies were turning away farmers, who had lined-up with their produce, saying they did not have the SMS confirming an appointment for procurement at the Mandi.“Our crop was ready for harvest but we did not get any SMS to bring it to the Mandi yet. I brought wheat produce from three acre of land to the Karnal grain market but was not allowed to enter for hours,” alleged Bhupinder Singh, a farmer from Bijna village in the district. He added that he had registered for procurement of 450 quintals of wheat but did not get any SMS.The protesting farmers unloaded wheat outside the office of the Mandi secretary and said that they will stage a sit-in till procurement of their produce begins. “We cannot delay the harvesting of crops as farmers use the same set of harvesters and the government should procure all the wheat coming to the Mandis,” demanded Bhajan Singh, a farmer.The farmer union leaders are demanding that all the wheat arriving at the Mandi is procured at the minimum support price MSP of ₹1,975 per quintal.Karnal deputy commissioner Nishant Yadav called a meeting of procurement agencies and Mandi officials to break the deadlock. District officials said SMSs were being sent to farmers as harvesting was yet to pick pace and the moisture content in wheat was also high at the moment.Officials from Haryana food and civil supplies department said on condition of anonymity that the government may relax the criteria to allow 50% farmers to visit Mandi as per the schedule sent by SMS, while 30% will be called by the commissioner agents and the remaining 20% farmers would be allowed to walk in to Mandis with their produce. All the farmers must be registered on the Meri Fasal Mera Bayora portal and should procure an online gate pass on arrival at Mandi, they said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-protest-wheat-procurement-process-in-karnal-as-fresh-standoff-builds-101617442627970.html

As India on Saturday reported the biggest single-day jump since last September with 89,129 new Covid-19 cases, the active number of Covid-19 cases breached the 6.5 lakh mark and settled at 6,58,909. The Union health ministry published a graph of how these cases increased in the last two months and which states have contributed the most.Why active case count is importantActive Covid-19 cases refer to the number of people currently carrying the infection. This is an indicator of how actively the spread is taking place. This count is also a statement about a state's healthcare efficiency because active cases will not shoot up unless there is a gap between daily infections and daily recoveries.10 states recorded a massive jump in active cases between February 3 and April 3Maharashtra, Karnataka, Chhattisgarh, Punjab, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Delhi, Gujarat, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh are the 10 states that recorded a maximum jump in the number of active cases in the last two months.Massive surge in Covid-19 cases in India this week. 10 points9-fold increase in Maharashtra, 12-fold in Punjab, 10-fold in DelhiThe Centre has already identified Maharashtra and Punjab as the two states of concerns given the steady surge in the number of daily infections. According to the ministry's data, on February 3, there were 42,830 active Covid-19 cases in Maharashtra, which increased to 3,91,203 on April 3. But Punjab has outdone Maharashtra as the state had only 2,122 active cases on February 3. Two months after, the number became 24,458.

In 2014, he underwent a successful kidney transplant after his wife Molly donated a kidney.People close to the NC leader said Abdullah was ‘immunocompromised’ because of the kidney transplant.Earlier on Tuesday, Omar said his father tested positive for Covid-19 and was showing some symptoms of the disease.“I will be self-isolating along with other family members until we get ourselves tested. I request anyone who has come in contact with us over the last few days to take all the mandated precautions,” Omar Abdullah then said.Besides various terms as Lok Sabha member, Farooq Abdullah has thrice been the chief minister of Jammu and Kashmir in 1982, 1986 and 1996.

03-04-2021||India||Bring NDA back to power, Modi tells voters at his last poll rally in Assam||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday urged voters in Assam to bring back the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) alliance to power in the state for continued momentum of growth. At his last rally ahead of the third and last phase of polling in Assam on Tuesday, Modi listed developmental projects undertaken by the Centre and the BJP-led state government. He referred to the construction of bridges over the Brahmaputra and an improved road network. “To continue this momentum of growth and development, it is very important to bring back NDA government to power. We believe in sabka saath, sabka vikas, sabka vishwas (with all, development for all, with the trust of all). We do not discriminate in our schemes and everyone is equally benefitted,” he said at the rally in Tamulpur. Earlier this week, the Bodoland Peoples’ Front (BPF) candidate from Tamulpur, Rangja Kungur Basumatary, withdrew from the contest and joined the BJP. Basumatary’s move is expected to help Leho Ram Boro, who is BJP ally United People’s Party Liberal’s candidate from Tamulpur.BPF was part of the BJP-led government in Assam before it switched over to the Congress-led alliance of seven parties. The party won 12 seats in 2016 and is contesting the same number of seats this time. Modi accused the Congress-led alliance of conspiring to take over Assam. “The election is still on. But yesterday some people made an announcement saying what kind of dress those in the next government would wear. There can be no greater dishonour for Assam and its culture. It is shocking that they are conspiring to take over Assam. You have to come out in large numbers and vote to foil their designs,” Modi said. Modi was referring to a statement made by lawmaker Abdur Rahim Ajmal, who is the son of All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF) chief Badruddin Ajmal.Abdur Rahim Ajmal said there will be a dari-tupi-lungi (beard-skullcap-loincloth) government in Assam this time. AIUDF is part of the Congress-led alliance. The BJP has continuously targeted Congress and AIUDF by calling their alliance unholy. Many BJP leaders including Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah have said that Ajmal would encourage infiltration from Bangladesh if he comes to power and would destroy Assam’s culture. “This is my last election meeting in Assam. This is an occasion not just to ask for votes for the third phase but also to thank you for the blessings you have showered to us in the first two phases. From my meetings, I can say that you have decided to bring NDA back to power again,” Modi said. Polling is being held for 40 seats in the last phase of polling. The results will be declared on May 2.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bring-nda-back-to-power-modi-tells-voters-at-his-last-poll-rally-in-assam-101617436267306.html

03-04-2021||India||Himanta Biswa Sarma likely to seek EC's review of ban on him campaigning||Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader and Assam minister Himanta Biswa Sarma was likely to seek the Election Commission (EC)’s review of its Friday order barring him from campaigning in the ongoing assembly polls.“We are not going to HC [high court] with regards to the EC order. But there are plans to approach the EC to appeal to review its Friday order,” said a person aware of Sarma’s plans.Reports earlier said Sarma was likely to move the Gauhati High Court against the order.On Friday, EC barred Sarma from campaigning for 48 hours after the Congress filed a complaint against him alleging he threatened to put Bodoland Peoples’ Party (BPF) chief Hagrama Mohilary behind bars.Since campaigning for the third and final phase of polls ends on Sunday, the order effectively puts an end to Sarma’s campaign.A total of 40 seats including Jalukbari, from where Sarma is contesting, will go to the polls in the third phase on April 6.“The commission strongly condemns the impugned statements made by Sh. Himanta Biswa Sarma, BJP leader and star campaigner,” said the order issued by EC secretary Ajay Kumar Verma.“The commission under Article 324 of Constitution of India and all other powers enabling in this behalf, bars him from holding any public meetings, public processions, public rallies, road shows, interviews and public utterances in media (electronic, print, social media) etc. in connection with ongoing elections for 48 hours from immediate effect on 02.04.2021 (Friday).”Also Read: The other battle in Assam—Sarbananda Sonowal versus Himanta Biswa SarmaHolding him prima facie guilty of violating the model code of conduct, EC Thursday sent a notice to Sarma directing him to “explain his position” by 5 pm on Friday.Though Sarma denied the allegations against him in his reply, the EC found it to be unsatisfactory.“I am asked by ECI to stop campaigning for the next 48 hours. Therefore, all my meetings scheduled for tomorrow stand cancelled,” Sarma tweeted.One of BJP’s leading campaigners, Sarma was attending 6-7 meetings daily besides conducting roadshows. Between February 25 and March 30, he attended 71 poll meetings, held roadshows, bike and cycle rallies, and visited 73 of the total 126 assembly constituencies in the state.On Friday, he took part in five public rallies and one roadshow.“Assam’s forever-in-waiting CM can’t issue some threats to unleash state agencies and bully the BPF,” Assam Congress president Ripun Bora tweeted after the EC order on Friday.On March 30, Congress filed the complaint with EC alleging that Sarma had “openly threatened” to send Mohilary to jail by misusing National Investigation Agency.Mohilary’s BPF is part of the Congress alliance of seven parties which also includes the All-India United Democratic Front.Congress alleged that Sarma with his threats also attempted to influence voters not to vote for the Congress-led alliance including BPF.Following the complaint, the EC obtained the full transcript of Sarma’s statement. He was found to have prima facie violated the model code of conduct.A former chief of the rebel group Bodo Liberation Tigers, Mohilary joined a peace process in 2003.BPF was also part of the BJP-led government in Assam. It later joined the Congress-led alliance and is contesting 12 seats.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sarma-moves-court-against-ec-ban-on-campaigning-101617432187439.html

While gyms and swimming pools remain closed, shopping malls and departmental stores must ensure compliance with Covid-19 appropriate behaviour from customers. Moreover, classes from 6-9 have been suspended and all gatherings at places of worship remain prohibited.5. Amid an increased tourist footfall, the Jammu and Kashmir government is resorting to a 'fast-track vaccination' process in four districts of Jammu, Srinagar, Budgam, and Baramulla. The administration is aiming to inoculate all persons in the eligible age group in these four districts, which account for the maximum number of Covid-19 cases in the union territory.6. The central government has categorised 11 states and Union territories as those being "of grave concern" with regard to the Covid-19 situation. In a high-level meeting on Friday chaired by cabinet secretary Rajiv Gauba, the authorities directed Maharashtra, Punjab, Chhattisgarh, Karnataka, Kerala, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Madhya Pradesh, Chandigarh, Haryana, and Delhi to make a "time-bound plan" to ensure 100% vaccination of every single eligible beneficiary.7. With 1,733 Covid-19 new cases, West Bengal, too, logged its highest single-day spike of 2021 on Friday, a health department bulletin said. Kolkata alone accounts for 513 of these fresh cases, followed by North 24 Parganas at 331.8. With regards to vaccination, a total of 36.7 lakh doses of Covid-19 vaccines were administered across India on Friday, the highest single-day coverage till now. As per the union health ministry's provisional report till 8pm on Friday, more than seven crores (7,06,18,026, to be exact) vaccine doses have been administered in the country. Maharashtra is at the heart of India's vaccination drive, with the state accounting for 9.48% of the total vaccine doses administered.9. India is the leading vaccine exporter in the world, with over 640 lakh doses supplied to more than 80 countries till now, the Union Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) has informed. The ministry's spokesperson Arindam Bagchi asserted on Friday that India's 'Vaccine Maitree' initiative to supply vaccines abroad has been "very successful". Of the total 644 lakh doses supplied abroad till now, 104 lakh have been delivered as a "grant", 357 lakh on a commercial basis, and 182 lakh through the 'COVAX' initiative, Bagchi said.10. Experts have recommended that the private sector step up and collaborate with the government to speed up the country's vaccination drive. VK Paul, NITI Aayog member, told reporters earlier this week that the private vaccine providers need to participate in India's inoculation campaign. "We were told there are 20,000 private vaccination centres in the country. But less than 6,000 vaccination centres are being run by the private sector in India. We request the private sector to make the remaining vaccination centres functional and increase their number," he was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/massive-surge-in-covid-19-cases-in-india-this-week-10-points-101617418846899.html

To this, the Congress leader said: "I do not hear anything from the US establishment about what's happening in India. If you are saying partnership of democracies, I mean what is your view on what is going on here."The Lok Sabha MP from Wayanad also claimed that the reason parties like the Bahujan Samaj Party, the Samajwadi Party, and the Nationalist Congress Party are also not winning elections in India was the "wholesale capture of the country's institutional framework" and "an absolute financial and media dominance by the BJP"."In Assam, the gentleman who runs our campaign has been sending videos of BJP candidates running around voting machines in their cars. But there is nothing going on in national media," Gandhi said during the virtual conversation with Burns.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rahul-gandhi-wants-to-know-us-govt-s-view-on-what-s-going-on-in-india-101617425414775.html

03-04-2021||India||89,030 new cases in India, highest since Sept 19||A total of 89,030 new cases of the coronavirus disease were reported across India on Friday, the highest single-day increase in infections in the country since September 19, 2020, as the second wave of the viral outbreak continued to spread its footprint across the country at an alarming rate.The seven-day average of daily cases across the country, a figure which denotes a region’s case trajectory, soared to 68,969 on Friday, the highest since October 13 last year.Friday’s new cases takes the total number of confirmed infections in the country to 12,391,140.The second wave of the outbreak is dangerously expanding its footprint throughout the country at a time when the vaccination drive has finally started gathering momentum – on Thursday, India had opened its Covid-19 vaccination programme to everyone over the age of 45 years.Experts have repeatedly stressed that a widespread inoculation drive is the best, and perhaps, the only chance the country has to turn the tide against the building second wave of infections.A total of 70,618,026 doses have been administered across the country as of Friday night, according to data released by the Union health ministry.Friday’s national case tally is particularly noteworthy because the last time India reported more cases in a single day was on September 19, 2020, which was just three days after the country’s first wave peaked (on September 16).India’s highest single-day caseload was 99,181 on September 10, according to the HT dashboard.Just one state, Maharashtra, alone accounted for 54% of all infections reported on Friday. The western state, which is the country’s worst-hit region with 2.9 million confirmed cases, recorded 47,827 new Covid-19 cases, the highest daily count since the start of the pandemic in March last year. This is the second day in a row that the state has set a new record for daily infections.On the second spot, Karnataka reported 4,991 new infections, while Chhattisgarh saw 4,174 new cases on Friday.As many as 713 new Covid deaths were reported across the country on Friday, however, this number was inflated due to Maharashtra adding 279 old fatalities to its tally that had earlier been unreported.A total of 164,162 people have lost their lives to the viral outbreak in the country so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/89030-new-cases-in-india-highest-since-sept-19-101617403212841.html

But is the outbreak in Maharashtra magnifying the severity of India’s second wave? Do India’s current Covid numbers look better if we remove Maharashtra’s numbers from the national tally? The answer to both is: not really. Indeed, the magnitude of the outbreak in Maharashtra may have actually masked the march of the viral disease in other states.Removing Maharashtra from the national tally results in two key, but grim, findings. First, the severity of India’s second Covid wave does not reduce at all; it is only delayed. Second, it shows that nine other states, spread across the country geographically, are rapidly becoming Covid-19 hot spots.CLick here for complete Covid-19 coverage1. India’s second wave gets a 12-day delay...On the basis of the seven-day average of daily infections, which denotes a region’s case trajectory, India’s first Covid wave bottomed out on February 11 at 10,988. This is the point from where the second wave started.If Maharashtra’s numbers are removed from the national numbers — it is important to caveat that this is an academic exercise since some of the infections elsewhere in India might have originated in Maharashtra and vice versa — the bottoming out of the Covid wave still takes place, but is delayed by 12 days. Instead of the trend reversing on February 11, the Indian trajectory (without Maharashtra) bottoms out on February 23 (at an average of 7,395 new cases a day). But the reversal is just as evident even without taking Maharashtra into account.To be sure, there is a gap of over 3,000 cases a day in the two troughs, but that is to be expected given the state excluded is the country’s second most populous (after Uttar Pradesh) and has been a massive hot spot throughout India’s battle with Covid.2. ... but the severity of the wave remains intactIf the 12-day gap is taken into account and the two outbreaks (with, and without Maharashtra) aligned from the day each of them bottomed out, it is clear that even without counting numbers from Maharashtra, cases across the country are rising just as fast. Without Maharashtra, the country’s case trajectory has grown 288% in the 37 days since bottoming out – the seven-day average of daily cases went from 7,395 on February 23 to 28,670 on April 1.Also Read | Lockdown in Maharashtra can't be ruled out as Covid-19 cases rise, says Uddhav; stricter curbs to be announced soonOverall, India’s trajectory has grown 493% since bottoming out – the seven-day average went from 10,988 on February 11 to 65,146 for the week ending April 1 – but this has been over a period of 49 days since bottoming out.To put these two sets of numbers in context, it is important to look at the overall numbers (India including Maharashtra) 37 days since its bottoming out. The seven-day average of daily cases at that point in time was 34,271, or 212% more than its trough value.This means that even without Maharashtra, the country’s case rate (while delayed by 12 days) is rising at a faster rate today than it was with Maharashtra taken into account.3. Maharashtra’s huge numbers mask nine hot spotsAs stated above, a majority of cases reported across the country (56%) over the past week have been in Maharasthra. This is such a large proportion that it ends up masking numbers from other states. For instance, Karnataka is the state on the second spot on this list, but it has contributed only 5% of all cases in the country in the past week. In the third spot is Chhattisgarh, with 4.8% of all new cases in the country in the past week, followed by Punjab with 4.4% of India’s cases.But when the same numbers are looked at after excluding Maharashtra, it is clear that there are nine regions that have each contributed heavily to the tally. These nine regions – Karnataka, Chhattisgarh, Punjab, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Kerala, Delhi and Uttar Pradesh – are responsible for nearly 75% of all new infections in the country in the past week (excluding Maharashtra).There are two worrying things about the nine. One, they are spread geographically across the country. This counters the current idea that the regions currently reporting rising cases are primarily located in western part of the country (like Maharashtra, Gujarat, etc). Two, with the exception of Kerala, the 7-day average of daily cases is rising in all nine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/exclude-maharashtra-and-india-s-second-covid-wave-is-still-frightening-101617402320617.html
03-04-2021||India||Covid-19: For second consecutive day, Delhi inoculates over 52,000 people||The city administered more than 50,000 doses of Covid-19 vaccines for the second straight day on Friday, as people aged 45 and above drove up the Capital’s inoculation numbers a day after jabs were opened up for them.Delhi saw 71,284 shots administered on Thursday, the most in a single day so far.Of the 52,408 shots given on Friday, 30,764 were first doses administered to those between the ages of 45 and 59. The vaccination drive was opened up in March to those above the age of 60, and those between 45 and 59 with comorbidities.In Delhi, 1.14 million people have received at least one dose of the vaccine so far, which accounts for about 5.7% of the city’s nearly 20 million population. As on Friday, 273,000 people have received both doses of the vaccine, showed government data.Experts said the pace of vaccinations was too slow to prevent a surge in cases.“When we say that 5% have been immunised, they haven’t completed their entire vaccination schedule. The best possible protection is achieved only about two weeks after both doses are administered,” said Dr GC Khilnani, former head of the department of pulmonology at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences.Health experts also urged residents to follow masking and social distancing norms, even after getting inoculated.“People must continue to wear masks when they step outside, even if they have been vaccinated, because there is still a risk of getting the infection and spreading it. There is a need to increase the number of vaccines being administered. But any impact — fewer hospitalisations or deaths — of this will be visible only after eight to 12 weeks,” said Dr Lalit Kant, former head of the department of epidemiology at the Indian Council of Medical Research.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-for-second-consecutive-day-delhi-inoculates-over-52-000-people-101617395944898.html
03-04-2021||India||Odisha asks collectors to vaccinate people with co-morbidities on priority||With Covid-19 infections doubling in a week's span, the Odisha government on Friday asked health officials to step up vaccination among people with comorbidities and expand necessary health infrastructure.Odisha on Friday reported 461 new Covid-19 cases, up from 210 just a week ago. The number of active Covid-19 patients has now gone up to 2586. Nuapara district reported 86 new infections today.In a letter to all district collectors, municipal commissioners and CDMOs and public health officers, additional chief secretary (health) Pradipta Mohapatra urged them to step up vaccination of patients with co-morbidities on a war footing.“The required numbers of beds with oxygen facilities in district headquarter hospitals and medical college hospitals should be kept in readiness for immediate use of Covid-19 patients. Other categories of isolation beds in ICU, HDU, dialysis, labour room should also be kept in readiness for immediate use of patients. Private hospitals of the districts should also be kept in readiness for immediate use at short notice. Adequate stock of medicines like Flavipiravir, Remdisivir etc should be maintained at district level to meet the demand at the local level. District teams should be re-oriented on the SOP for treatment of patients under home isolation, and the same should be followed without fail,” Mohapatra wrote in his letter.Mohapatra also pointed out that the RRTs teams should undertake periodic visits to patients under home isolation as per SOP.The district administration of Jharsuguda banned weekly markets in the district for the next 3 weeks to check the spread of Covid-19 as minister of state (Home) Dibya Shankar Mishra told the Odisha Assembly on Friday that the rise in Covid-19 cases in western Odisha was due to a cricket tournament in Raipur town of Chhattisgarh.The Road Safety World Cricket Series 2020-21 played between March 5 and 21 at Raipur’s Saheed Veer Narayan Singh International Cricket stadium saw large attendance of youth from western Odisha districts like Kalahandi, Bargarh and Nuapara. After the rise in Covid-19 cases in western Odisha district of Nuapara, the state government curbed inter-state bus service to Chhattisgarh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-asks-collectors-to-vaccinate-people-with-co-morbidities-on-priority-101617393223186.html
03-04-2021||India||Chhattisgarh adds 4,174 new Covid-19 cases, new variant found||Chhattisgarh continues to witness a spurt in Covid-19 cases as 4,174 people were detected with the viral infection on Friday, taking the overall tally to 3,57,978, an official said.With 43 more deaths due to the viral infection and co-morbidities recorded during the day, the death toll climbed to 4,247, a health official said.Chhattisgarh Health Minister TS Singh Deo said a new variant of the coronavirus had been detected in eight patients from the state.The health minister said, “As per recent reports (of the samples of Covid-19 patients from the state) received from the Centre, a new strain called N440K of the coronavirus has been found in eight patients,”“However, the variant is a normal mutation (of the virus) and there is no need to worry. Neither the Centre nor our scientists have warned that it is more virulent. Whatever treatment and procedure was underway for the previous strain, the same will be continued for the new variant,” he added.As many as 52 people were discharged from hospitals while 893 others completed their home isolation period today, leaving the state with 31,858 active cases. The number of people who have recovered from the infection increased to 3,21,873, he said.The worst-hit districts of Raipur and Durg accounted for 1,405 and 964 of the new cases respectively. While the total count of the infection in Raipur has touched 68,404, including 930 deaths, Durg’s caseload increased to 41,032, including 766 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chhattisgarh-adds-4-174-new-covid-19-cases-new-variant-found-101617391373838.html
03-04-2021||India||What science tells us about Covid-19 vaccines||Re-infections, infections after vaccine shots, prevention of transmission – the Indian medical and scientific space is beset with conflicting information regarding Covid-19 and the vaccines meant to stop the virus’s march, with some originating from the very people who should be shedding clarity on the issues. On Thursday, April 2, HT and some others published details of a study conducted by scientists from the Indian Council of Medical Research that suggested a 4.5% re-infection rate, but without analysing the genomes of the first and the second infections. These may not have been readily available – despite a surge that is most likely caused by so-called VOCs, or variants of concern, especially in Maharashtra, India is not sequencing as many viral genomes as it should, nor even as many as it promised to when variants became a matter of concern. The number is also much higher than what most international studies suggest – a reinfection rate of under 1%. Indeed, if the reinfection rate is 4.5%, as indicated by the study, then the house is already on fire.Click here for complete Covid-19 coverageThere are also some reports, likely true, of doctors who have received two doses of the vaccine, as prescribed, contracting Covid-19. According to science, immunity sets in around two weeks after the second dose, although research recommends delaying the second dose in the case of the Covishield vaccine (the Indian version of the Oxford/ AstraZeneca vaccine) by 6-8 weeks to maximise immunity. That means these people should have been immune. How, then, did they get infected?Data put out by the companies behind the two vaccines in use in India (Bharat Biotech is the second) claim an efficacy of 70%-80% in preventing infections. Taking the lower end of the range, let’s assume the vaccine is effective in 70% of cases. What does this mean? It means 70% of those vaccinated will not be infected. Conversely, three of every 10 people who have received vaccines may be, and that is likely what is emerging, especially as the rate of infection itself speeds as the intensity of the second wave of infections in India becomes stronger. But both vaccines are also, based on their makers’ claims, 100% effective in preventing severe disease and death. This means no one who gets the vaccine will die from Covid-19. Low as India’s case fatality rate is, this is still a relief.Science isn’t very clear on whether those vaccinated could still carry the virus even if they don’t get infected themselves, and whether they can then pass it on to others. The answer is likely yes, which means that the vaccines probably do not offer any protection against transmission. This is important to understand – especially in a country where even the announcement of vaccines was met with a collective exhalation of relief and rapid abandonment of all Covid-safe behaviour. There were a few rash statements by health administrators at the beginning of the vaccine drive that the shots prevent transmission, but they do not.Finally, there’s been some confusion on Adverse Events Following Immunisation (or AEFI) as it is called. The Economic Times reported on Friday that six of the 13 AEFI cases studied by the national committee looking at these showed a “consistent causal” relationship with the vaccination, a finding that has set alarm bells ringing in various quarters. But the report also adds that none of the cases were caused by the vaccine itself. Clearly, more clarity is needed (the committee studied 13 cases till March 9). Till then, it makes sense to look closely at the numbers. There were 79 deaths till March 13, according to a report in The Hindu. India had administered 29.19 million doses of the vaccine till that day (18.56 million had one dose and 5.21 million both doses). So, these 79 deaths need to be seen in the context of the 24 million people vaccinated. Which means, 99.9997% of the people who take the vaccine have no reason to fear.So, what do the vaccines do? They prevent death and severe disease in all cases, infections in the majority of cases, and perhaps do not have any bearing at all on transmission. This is what science tells us as of today, April 2. If there is an update, you will read it here. Meanwhile, take the jab.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/what-science-tells-us-about-covid-19-vaccines-101617391020870.html
03-04-2021||India||Bengaluru’s cab fare hike comes with some relief, many concerns||Karnataka government’s decision to increase the basic fare for cabs services in Bengaluru has come as a relief and with concerns for both drivers and customers. The increase, which is up to 92%, comes days after a debt-ridden cab driver died by suicide at Bengaluru’s Kempegowda International Airport. As per the state government order, the minimum fare was increased to ₹75 for small cabs and ₹150 for luxury taxis for the first 4 kilometres. Earlier, the rates for these categories were ₹44 and ₹80 respectively. While some cab drivers call this a welcome move considering the recent inflation, customers feel this could discourage people from taking cabs and rely on private vehicles. Cab aggregator drivers’ association members said they will hold another meeting with the transport department for more clarifications on the new changes. Tanveer Pasha, former President of Ola and Uber Drivers Association told Hindustan Times that the revised rates have not come into effect, despite the government order. Pasha said as per the communication from the state transport department, the new fares will be implemented from Monday since Friday was a government holiday. “This is a welcome decision because cab drivers have been suffering for a long time. When companies were charging ₹8 per kilometre, it was the driver who was suffering. Autorickshaws in the city charge ₹13 per kilometres and the cab driver, who has to pay EMIs for cars that cost up to ₹10 and pay almost ₹90 for diesel, was getting a bad deal. The companies could keep the rates low to attract business, but the problem is that discounts were not coming from the companies’ pockets and the drivers were paying for it,” said Pasha. He added that the cab driver died by suicide because he was struggling to pay off the car loans and fear the seizure of his car. On Tuesday, a 34-year-old cab driver, Pratap, set himself ablaze in his cab. Pratap was with an airport taxi service of Karnataka State Tourism Development Corporation. His death led to protest demanding regularization of the cab fares since cab services, like the one owned by KSTDC, was charging up to ₹24 per kilometre while Ola and Uber were operating under ₹10 per kilometre. While the association is happy with the decision, cab drivers have apprehensions about the new directive. Manjunath Gowda, driver attached to cab aggregator said that he fears that the increase could have an adverse effect on the demand for cabs. “From the city to the airport it takes ₹600-900. With the new rule, it could be ₹1,200 to 1,800. Will people opt for cabs in a big question,” said Gowda. Rohan Thomas, graphics designer based in Bengaluru, who uses cabs for his daily commute said that the revised charges would burn a big hole in his pockets. “Unlike New Delhi or Mumbai, Bengaluru doesn’t have a good public transport system and cabs are the most preferred mode of transport. I’m really concerned about the new move. Losing customers like me can’t be good for cab drivers also, right?” he asked. The fare structure is classified into four categories as per the cost of vehicles, with A being highest (more than ₹16 lakh) and D being the lowest (up to ₹5 lakh). The largest increase was given in category C ( ₹5-10 lakhs), which is the most prominent category among cab services. Ramesh Kalburgi, another cab driver said that instead of the steep increase in the fares, the government should have increased the drivers’ share in the earning from a ride. A senior official in the Karnataka Transport Department said following the incident at the airport, the cab drivers had approached the government. “They pointed out that there was a disparity in fares. The government also believes that cab drivers who are contributing to the development of the city were at a disadvantage and within days we issued the revised rates. The last time they were updated was in 2018,” the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengalurus-cab-fare-hike-comes-with-some-relief-many-concerns-101617390424935.html
03-04-2021||India||India wields oil 'weapon' to cut dependence on Saudi||When India's government last month asked refiners to speed up diversification and reduce dependence on the Middle East - days after OPEC+ said it would maintain production cuts - it sent a message about its clout and foreshadowed changes to the world's energy maps.It was a move that had been in the works for years, fuelled by repeated comments from Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan, who in 2015 called oil purchases a "weapon" for his country.When the Organisation of Oil Exporting Countries and Major Producers (OPEC+) extended the production cuts into April, India unsheathed that weapon. Indian refiners plan to cut imports from the Kingdom by about a quarter in May, sources told Reuters, dropping them to 10.8 million barrels from monthly average of 14.7-14.8 million barrels.Oil secretary Tarun Kapoor, the top bureaucrat in the ministry, told Reuters that India is asking state refiners to jointly negotiate with oil producers to get better deals, but declined to comment on plans to cut Saudi imports."India is a big market so sellers have to be mindful of our country's demand as well to keep the long-term relationship intact," he said.The Saudi state oil company Saudi Aramco and the Saudi energy ministry declined to comment.Pradhan, who sees high oil prices as a threat to India's recovering economy, said he was saddened by the OPEC+ decision. India's fuel import bill has rocketed, and fuel prices – inflated by government taxes imposed last year - have hit records.The International Energy Agency forecasts India's consumption to double and its oil import bill to nearly triple from 2019 levels to more than $250 billion by 2040.An oil ministry official, who declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter, said the OPEC+ cuts have created uncertainty and made it difficult for refiners to plan for procurement and price risk.It also creates opportunities for companies in the Americas, Africa, Russia and elsewhere to fill the gap.If India is successful, it will set an example for other countries. As buyers see more affordable choices and renewable energy becomes increasingly common, the influence of big producers like Saudi Arabia could wane, altering geopolitics and trade routes.DIVERSIFICATION DRIVEIndia's oil demand has risen by 25% in the last seven years - more than any other major buyer - and the country has surpassed Japan as the world's third-largest oil importer and consumer.The country has already curbed its reliance on the Middle East from more than 64% of imports in 2016 to below 60% in 2019.That trend reversed in 2020, however, when the pandemic pummelled fuel demand and forced Indian refiners to make committed oil purchases from the Middle East under term contracts, shunning spot purchases.As India shifts gears again after Pradhan's call for faster diversification, refineries are looking for new suppliers, the oil ministry official said.Costly refinery upgrades that allow for the processing of cheaper, heavier oil grades have encouraged importers to seek out far-flung sources. HPCL-Mittal Energy Ltd bought the country's first cargo from Guyana this month, and Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd just imported Brazilian Tupi crude for the first time.Since the break with Saudi Arabia began, Pradhan has had meetings with United Arab Emirates' minister of state and chief executive of Abu Dhabi National Oil Co (ADNOC), Sultan Ahmed Al Jaber, and U.S. energy secretary Jennifer Granholm to strengthen energy partnerships.Pradhan recently said African nations could play a central role in India's oil diversification. The country is looking at signing long-term oil supply deal with Guyana and exploring options to raise imports from Russia, the oil ministry source said.A separate Indian government source said the government expects Iranian sanctions to ease in three to four months, potentially offering India a cheaper alternative to Saudi oil.Two traders agreed that Iran stood a good chance to benefit from India's shift, as did Venezuela, Kuwait and the United States. An Indian refinery source said the U.S., Africa, Kazakhstan's CPC Blend and Russian oil would probably get a look too.Although Indian importers will scoop up increasing volumes of attractively priced global grades, most analysts expect the Middle East to remain India's primary oil supplier, mainly because of lower shipping costs.India's oil ministry is working with refiners on a framework to jointly negotiate terms with suppliers."Buyers have alternatives in today's market and these alternatives are going to multiply going forward," Kapoor said."There are so many companies in India that do buying at their own level, so these companies coming together also becomes quite a big bloc."On Thursday, Saudi Arabia and OPEC+ agreed after discussions with U.S. officials to ease oil curbs beginning in May.Saudi energy minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman conceded that the production cuts had put state oil company Aramco "in some difficulty with some of its partners."THE RELATIONSHIPAnalysts say the oil spat does not need to spill over into broader strategic ties in other sectors, including defence."Until recently, the balance of power was skewed towards Saudi Arabia, but increasingly, India is using access to its market and the diversity of options to put pressure on Saudi Arabia," consultancy Eurasia said in a note. "For Saudi Arabia, losing market share in a global environment in which most developed economies are already seeing their oil demand decline due to green policy implementation, would be a blow."Abdulaziz confirmed that Aramco had maintained normal April oil supplies to Indian refiners while cutting volumes for other buyers - a sign Saudi Arabia is concerned about India's search for new sources.Saudi Arabia is India's fourth-biggest trade partner, importing a slew of items, including food. Saudi Armaco is looking at buying a 20% stake in Reliance Industries' oil and chemicals business. It is also a part of a joint venture to build a 1.2 million barrels per day refinery in India.But Amitendu Palit, senior research fellow at National University of Singapore, said it would be difficult for Saudi to find a stable alternative buyer if India continues with reduced purchases for too long."This bilateral relationship should not be impacted due to any decisions on one commodity. However in a global surplus, market buyers have a lot of negotiating power and sources," Palit said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-wields-oil-weapon-to-cut-dependence-on-saudi-101617389940308.html
03-04-2021||India||Rahul Gandhi hails Biden, seeks US govt views on what’s ‘going on’ in India||In a discussion with former US diplomat Nicholas Burns on Friday, senior Congress leader Rahul Gandhi wanted to know the US establishment’s views on what was “going on” in India.Burns, a professor with Harvard Kennedy School, had proposed that democratic countries such as India and the US should come together to take on China and other non-democratic forces, prompting Gandhi to say, “I don’t hear anything from the US establishment about what is happening in India. If you are saying about partnership in democracy, then what is your view on what’s going on here?”Gandhi answered questions on a wide range of subjects and maintained that countries must act to stop China as the global manufacturer or its Belt and Road initiative.The interaction, largely on economy and foreign policy, saw Gandhi supporting recent steps taken by US President Joe Biden. When asked about his comments of the US package on economic revival after Covid-19, Gandhi said, “President Biden is doing spot on. India should think along similar terms. Our government refuses to put money in system. The US has done groundbreaking.” He said that while there was a definite space for private sector, in areas such as education and health, public sector had a role to play.Talking about domestic politics, Gandhi said the Congress needed to redefine itself but added, “We are no longer in same paradigm. Institutions don’t protect us or support a fair political fight. There is complete control of system by the BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party].”“Opportunity for us is huge. We have to redefine ourselves too,” Gandhi said, asserting that people were fast losing hope with the current regime.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rahul-hails-biden-seeks-us-govt-views-on-what-s-going-on-in-india-101617390184661.html

Sunil shot a video of himself wherein he mentioned his frustration with the lack of job opportunities in the state as the reason behind his extreme step. “He breathed his last this (Friday) morning. The body has been moved to Gandhi Hospital in Secunderabad for postmortem after which it would be taken to his native place later in the night,” the Punjagutta police said.Activists of Telangana Youth Congress, led by state unit president Shiva Sena Reddy, staged a dharna in front of the Gandhi Hospital and demanded the resignation of Telangana chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao. They were immediately taken into custody by the police.“We were arrested when all we wanted was to pay floral tributes to the deceased. We shall take part in his funeral procession at his native place,” Reddy said.Minutes after consuming pesticide at a secluded place on the Kakatiya University campus, Sunil recorded a video on his mobile and sent it to his friends. In the video, Sunil said he was resorting to the extreme step not because he was inefficient and was dreaming to be a civil servant.“But I thought my death is the only way to open the eyes of the government. It has been seven years since the Telangana state was formed but the government has not filled up any job vacancies. Students who had struggled for a separate statehood are frustrated due to lack of jobs,” he said and asked the youth to fight against KCR (the chief minister).The police, who were alerted by his friends, quickly traced Sunil and took him to the MGM Hospital in Warangal. On Tuesday, he was brought to the NIMS, where he died on Friday.In the video, Sunil also said he was preparing for the competitive examinations and even cleared the written test for the sub-inspector’s examination in 2016 but was denied a job on the pretext that he didn’t meet the criteria as he wasn’t tall enough.“There have been no job recruitments in Telangana since then. If I survive, I will continue my struggle for the jobs; otherwise, Telangana’s youth should fight against the government,” he said.Bharatiya Janata Party state president Bandi Sanjay lashed out at the TRS government for ignoring the plight of the unemployed. “The youth are frustrated due to the lack of employment opportunities. Since Sunil named the chief minister in his selfie video before suicide, the police should arrest KCR,” he demanded.Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee president N Uttam Kumar Reddy said the unfortunate incident reflects the height of negligence of the TRS government towards the unemployed youth. “The Congress will be on the forefront of the struggles of the youth to carry on the fight for job recruitments,” he said.TRS leaders could not be reached for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/telangana-man-decries-lack-of-jobs-in-video-dies-after-consuming-pesticide-101617390004823.html
03-04-2021||India||Minister’s charge against CM under review, says BJP||Bengaluru Rural development and panchayat raj minister K S Eshwarappa’s allegation of interference in his departmental affairs by chief minister B S Yediyurappa is under review and will be resolved in the next two days, state Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) chief Nalin Kumar Kateel said on Friday. Eshwarappa, meanwhile, dismissed claims that he was targeting the chief minister over personal differences and asserted that he was always loyal to the party.Addressing reporters in Mangaluru, Kateel said: “This will end well. In the next two days, I will only resolve it.” The BJP leader added that the party is reviewing the developments that have taken place in the last two days and discussions will be held with all concerned parties to resolve the issue. Besides this, Kateel said a notice has been sent to BJP MLA Basanagouda Patil Yatnal seeking clarification on his critical comments (seeking Yediyurappa’s removal) in March against the chief minister. In a strongly-worded letter to governor Vajubai Vala on Wednesday, Eshwarappa had said that Yediyurappa had indiscriminately sanctioned funds to various MLAs and other persons in violation of rules. On Friday, the minister said he was merely trying to reinstate the practice of following rules and procedures. “I am not a rebel, I am loyal. I have always been loyal from the beginning and will never rebel against my party,” the minister, who belongs to Yediyurappa’s home district of Shivamogga, told reporters in Mysuru. “Without my knowledge ₹65 crore was sanctioned for the Bengaluru Urban district Panchayat. Further, ₹774 crore was released in the first instalment and ₹460 crore in the second instalment. So altogether ₹1,299 crore was released, which violates the Business Transaction Rules,” the minister alleged.Eshwarappa also recalled how Yediyurappa had quit the saffron party in 2012 to form the Karnataka Janata Party (KJP).The developments come at a time when Yediyurappa already finds himself in a corner over the recent sexual harassment case involving former minister Ramesh Jarkiholi, non-performance of his two-year-old government, cash crunch and growing calls for his removal among other problems.The three bypolls on April 17 have presented the 78-year-old with an opportunity to silence growing dissent and consolidate his position for the remainder of the two years in power.Leader of Opposition Siddaramaiah on Thursday urged the Karnataka governor to immediately remove Yediyurappa and recommend President’s rule in the state. “The governor must immediately intervene, remove the chief minister and recommend for President’s rule,” the Congress leader said in a statement.However, at least four Cabinet ministers extended their support to the chief minister on Thursday.“The chief minister has allocated RDPR funds to the MLAs and it is an administrative issue. Since Eshwarappa heads the department and is unhappy over this, it has to be resolved among ourselves,” Karnataka home, law and parliamentary affairs minister Basavaraj Bommai said.“We do not know if there is Centre’s sanction but there are some invisible hands operating. Yatnal and Eshwarappa are only mouths and the hands operating them are unseen,” A Narayana, political analyst and faculty at the Azim Premji University, had said on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ministers-charge-against-cm-under-review-says-bjp-101617389824210.html
03-04-2021||India||Muslim man travelling with Hindu woman stabbed in Karnataka: Cops||A 23-year-old Muslim man was beaten up and stabbed by a group of men, believed to be right-wing activists, for travelling with a Hindu woman in a bus in coastal Karnataka’s Dakshina Kannada district on Thursday, police officials said on Friday.The victim, identified as Anwar Mohammed by police, has been admitted to the intensive care unit at a private hospital in Mangaluru. His condition is said to be serious.Thursday’s incident comes at a time several states in the country, including Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh, have introduced laws regulating inter-faith marriages, deemed by right-wing activists as “love jihad”.According to police, the man and the woman (23), who knew each other from school, were travelling in an overnight bus from Mangaluru to Bengaluru when the group of men stopped the bus and attacked the man. It wasn’t immediately clear how the group knew that the two were on the bus.The woman, whose identity was not released by the police, was also attacked and suffered minor injuries.“Around 9pm, they stopped the bus near Pumpwell Circle in Mangaluru. They initially questioned [the man and the woman] why they were travelling together and later stabbed the man with a sharp object,” said Mangaluru police commissioner Shashi Kumar.The officer added that Mohammad was accompanying the woman as she had applied for a job in Bengaluru and hadn’t been to the city before.An FIR has been registered for attempt to murder (IPC section 307) among other sections at the Kankanady police station in Mangaluru. No arrests have been made so far. Police officials at the station said they are questioning some suspects in the case, but that the perpetrators have not been identified.Since the attack on Thursday, a WhatsApp message doing the rounds claims Bajrang Dal activists stopped the duo from travelling. “Ongoing Operation by Bajrang Dal Today (Thursday). A Hindu young woman who was fleeing with a Muslim man was travelling from Mangaluru to Bengaluru. Bajrang Dal activists stopped the couple near Pumpwell,” read a message.SharanPumpwell, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad’s (VHP) divisional secretary, too claimed on Friday that the group’s men intercepted the couple because it was a case of “love jihad”, but that a mob gathered and turned violent. “We were trying to save the girl from love jihad. But after the mob gathered and turned violent. Police are investigating the case,” he added.Police said that they are investigating the VHP leader’s claim and the authenticity of the message.On Thursday, Gujarat became the latest Bharatiya Janata Party-led state to pass a Bill proposing amendments to the Freedom of Religion Act, 2002 to ensure stringent punishment for forced religious conversions.Last month, the UP Assembly passed the Prohibition of Unlawful Religious Conversion Bill, 2021 by a voice vote. In March, the MP Assembly passed the MP Freedom of Religion Bill 2020 to prohibit forcible religious conversion by way of allurement, fraud, threat or marriage. Haryana and Karnataka, too, are considering a similar law.While state governments claim their move is aimed at curbing cases of “love jihad”, where Muslim men allegedly lure and marry women from other religions to convert them, the Union government told Parliament in February 2020 that the term “love jihad” was not defined under any laws and no such case had been reported.Petitions have also been filed in the Supreme Court against the legislations, that petitioners say, can be misused to falsely implicate couples belonging to different faiths who marry out of their free will.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/muslim-man-travelling-with-hindu-woman-stabbed-cops-101617388864050.html

The girl’s father has alleged that the local police did not act on his earlier complaints against the stalker and once the sub inspector shooed him away from the police station. Even on Thursday, when he went to police after the attack, the complaint was not entertained. Police acted only when informed about the girl’s death, he alleged.

03-04-2021||India||India-France-Australia meet on April 13; maritime security, Indo-Pacific top agenda||The foreign ministers of India, France and Australia will hold a trilateral dialogue in Delhi on April 13 to discuss steps to strengthen maritime security and collaborate on shared challenges in the Indo-Pacific region, people familiar with the development said.The meeting will be held on the sidelines of a conference on geopolitics, Raisina Dialogue, which will also be attended by heads of state of Rwanda and Denmark apart from 10 foreign ministers. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expected to attend the opening and closing of the event.French foreign minister Jean-Yves Le Drian will begin his two-day visit to India on the evening of April 12. His meeting with Indian external affairs minister S Jaishankar and Australian foreign minister Marise Payne is scheduled for the following day.India, France and Australia are on the same page on addressing the challenges in the Indo-Pacific. In recent months, France has come around to acknowledging the central role that New Delhi can play in the shared commitment to freedom of navigation in the South China Sea.It is in recognition of the role that New Delhi can play that France decided to hold the La Pérouse joint naval exercise in the Bay of Bengal on April 4-7, and invited the Indian Navy to the wargame. The joint exercise, first held in 2019, earlier included navies from the three other members of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue or Quad: Australia, Japan and the US.“This (trilateral dialogue) will be a meeting of middle powers, who have democratic polity and have the economic strength and shared values to help each other in terms of trade and technology,” said a senior Indian official.The three foreign ministers will discuss the global security environment and the Chinese posture in the Indo-Pacific.Also Read | How much India should invest in the Indo-PacificFrench envoy Christophe Penot, who is an advisor to President Emmanuel Marcon on the Indo-Pacific, signalled the pivotal role that Paris expects New Delhi to play in the region when he briefed top diplomatic corps and heads of multilateral agencies in Paris this week. It is understood that Penot in his virtual briefing outlined the role of France, Australia and India in the Indo-Pacific with particular emphasis on New Delhi’s role in the efforts.A former foreign secretary linked the emphasis on India to the government’s decision to stand up to China when the latter tried to expand its territory across the Line of Actual Control.After this, this person added, “not only Quad powers but key strategic allies, France and UK, recognise the centrality of India in ensuring the right to free navigation in the Indo-Pacific.”Officials said it has helped that foreign ministers Jaishankar, Drian and Payne have a personal connect with each other apart from being representatives of democratic powers put under pressure by Chinese behaviour in East Ladakh, Caledonia and island territories, respectively, in the far Pacific.While India and France have deep defence cooperation with each other, Australia under Prime Minister Scott Morrison has joined hands with New Delhi on not only working on closer bilateral ties but also on military ties through multilateral naval exercises such as Malabar 2021.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indiafranceaustralia-meet-on-april-13-maritime-security-indo-pacific-top-agenda-101617388804180.html
03-04-2021||India||NIA questions Vaze colleagues in Hiran murder case||Mumbai The National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Friday questioned suspended Mumbai Police officer Sachin Vaze’s colleagues in connection with the murder of 48-year-old Thane auto parts dealer Mansukh Hiran last month. Riyazuddin Shaikh, an officer at Crime Intelligence Unit and crime branch officer Prakash Ovhal, who is believed to have purchased a Mitsubishi Outlander from Vaze, were probed for around nine hours at the central agency’s office on Peddar Road, NIA officials said. The agency also questioned a woman whose identity is yet to be ascertained.Besides this, the NIA also conducted raids at a hotel and a club in south Mumbai in connection with the case, news agency PTI reported. Customers and staff members of the hotel were asked to vacate the premises, located near the Babulnath temple. The NIA also recorded the statement of the owner of the club. Hiran was linked to the explosives-laden Scorpio found abandoned near industrialist Mukesh Ambani Antilia home in south Mumbai. He had gone missing late in the evening on March 4 and his body was recovered from a creek at Reti Bunder near Mumbra the next day.Six handkerchiefs were found stuffed in his mouth, and his face was covered by a scarf.On March 13, Vaze was arrested by NIA officials for his purported role in abandoning the vehicle with 20 loses gelatin sticks near Ambani’s residence.The Maharashtra anti-terrorism squad (ATS), which was earlier probing the case, arrested former constable Vinayak Shinde and cricket bookie Naresh Gor on March 21 in connection with the murder. ATS suspected that Vaze is also the prime accused in Hiran’s murder case, while Shinde allegedly helped him execute the murder, and Gor arranged for some SIM cards used in the commission of the crime from Gujarat.Both ATS and NIA officials believe that Mansukh was smothered in a vehicle at Gaimukh, along Ghodbunder Road.The initial probe by ATS had revealed that Hiran had received a call around 8.29 pm on March 4, and the caller spoke to him for around 11 minutes and asked him to meet near Majiwada junction on Ghodbunder Road.According to an ATS officer, the trader was made to sit in a four-wheeler at Majiwada junction, taken 10km away to Gaimukh breach front, and smothered in the vehicle at the spot. Later the body was dumped in the creek at Reti Bunder, suspect NIA officials.NIA is also trying to trace the Maruti Eeco, allegedly stolen from Aurangabad in November. The car’s original number plates were found during a search in Mithi river on March 28.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nia-questions-vaze-colleagues-in-hiran-murder-case-101617388744030.html
03-04-2021||India||Widespread rain likely in J&K, Uttarakhand: IMD||A fresh western disturbance is likely to affect the Western Himalayan region from the night of April 3, bringing widespread rain over Jammu and Kashmir, Ladakh, Himachal Pradesh, parts of Uttarakhand and surrounding areas, India Meteorological Department (IMD) predicted on Friday.There is a possibility of rain over the Western Himalayan region from April 4 to 6, IMD said. Due to the approaching western disturbance, no heatwave conditions are likely over most parts of northwest and Central India during the next 4-5 days except Rajasthan and Vidarbha, where there is possibility of heatwave on April 3 and 4, according to IMD officials.Heatwave conditions are also likely over Saurashtra, Kutch, Telangana and Rayalaseema during next 2 days, over Coastal Andhra Pradesh and Yanam during next 3 days, and over Tamil Nadu, Puducherry and Karaikal during next 4 days. There is a severe heatwave warning for isolated pockets over Coastal Andhra Pradesh and Yanam, IMD officials said.After the WD passes, maximum temperatures are likely to rise gradually over northwest India, including Delhi NCR. “By April 6 and 7, we are expecting maximum temperature in Delhi to be around 37 to 38 degrees Celsius. It will gradually rise to 40 degrees C. We are not expecting any major impact of the WD in Delhi. There may be some cloudiness and trace rainfall,” said Kuldeep Shrivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre. The maximum temperature in the national capital on Thursday was recorded at 34.4 degrees C, 1 degree above normal.Meanwhile, there is likely to be heavy and widespread rain over Andaman and Nicobar region for next two days. A depression over north Andaman Sea remained practically stationary and lay centred about 400 km east-northeast of Port Blair (Andaman Islands), 420 km north-northwest of Phuket (Thailand) and 640 km south of Yangon (Myanmar), IMD officials said. It is likely to move northeastwards towards Myanmar coast and intensify further into a deep depression during next 12 hours.Under its influence, widespread rainfall with isolated thunderstorm, lightning and gusty winds is very likely over Andaman and Nicobar Islands during the next 2 days. “As of today, we are not expecting the deep depression to intensify into a cyclonic storm. It will move towards the Myanmar coast and bring heavy rain over Andaman and Nicobar Islands and over the sea so maritime activities may be impacted,” said Sunitha Devi, in charge of cyclones at IMD. Fishermen are advised not to venture into the Andaman Sea till April 3.A trough (line of low pressure) in westerlies is likely to cause widespread rainfall over Arunachal Pradesh and isolated rainfall over Assam, Meghalaya, Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram and Tripura with isolated thunderstorm/lightning and gusty winds over the region during next 2-3 days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/widespread-rain-likely-in-j-k-u-khand-imd-101617388624633.html
03-04-2021||India||Centre gives thermal plants new deadlines to meet emission norms||The Union environment ministry has amended rules allowing thermal power plants within 10 kilometres of the National Capital Region (NCR) and in cities with more than 1 million population to comply with new emission norms by the end of 2022, official notification has said.The notification dated March 31 replaces the Environment (Protection) Rules, 1986, with the Environment (Protection) Amendment Rules, 2021.Thermal power plants within 10 km radius of critically polluted areas or non-attainment cities (that did not meet the annual national standard for particulate matter emissions from 2011 to 2015) will have to meet the standards by December 31, 2023, the notification said. HT has seen the notification.The environment ministry joint secretary Naresh Gangawar confirmed that the notification has been issued but did not divulge details on why the deadlines were deferred.The plants that do not fall in these two categories and are not scheduled for retirement will have to meet the norms by December 31, 2024, the notification said.The ministry notified superior emission standards for thermal power plants in December 2015 for implementation by the end of 2017. The deadline, however, was pushed to 2022 due to resistance from the thermal power industry.The environment ministry agreed to extend the deadline to 2022, and approached the Supreme Court, which also ordered for an extension.Later, the power ministry approached the environment ministry last year seeking a further delay in the deadline citing the Covid-19 associated economic slowdown. The power ministry also said that the Atmanirbhar Bharat campaign made it difficult to procure systems for flue gas desulphurization (FGD) that help to control SO2 emissions from thermal power plants.“Power ministry has approached us. They are finding it difficult to meet the 2022 deadline both because of Covid-19 and curbs on imports from China. We are considering the matter. We may have to give the thermal power plants time to deliver on the deadline,” RP Gupta, secretary, environment ministry said in August last year.Environmental experts said that the ministry was only favoring the power industry by delaying the deadline.“It is very unfortunate that MoEFCC sides with the polluters and law offenders time and again to give them extensions and dilutions rather than with the common public who is suffering from severe pollution and health impacts, whose interest MoEFCC is duty bound to protect. It’s not even a day since the extension and we can confidently say that many plants will not meet even the new deadline given that they are yet to even award any contracts to install pollution control equipment which would take three years to build by the power company’s own admission. Given that this is the third time this notification has been extended, MoEFCC needs to clarify what commitments they have received from power companies and ministry of power, which ensures the implementation at least this time around, otherwise it merely seems that the role of MoEFCC is just to extend deadlines and not to regulate their own laws and pollution,” said Sunil Dahiya, Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA) said in a statement on Friday.“This notification in one stroke has delayed the deadline for majority of the power plants in the country as there are only a few plants within 10 km radius of million plus cities that have been prioritised to meet the standards by 2022. While the plants that have already taken steps to meet the standards have not been incentivised, the laggards who have not acted on time, have been rewarded. This will perpetuate locking in of pollution and carbon when we are expected to accelerate our roadmap for clean air and low carbon growth path. Moreover, the effectiveness of the proposed penalty will have to be examined carefully,” said Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director, Centre for Science and Environment.A 2017 paper in the journal Nature warned against rising SO2 levels in India. The paper, India Is Overtaking China as the World’s Largest Emitter of Anthropogenic Sulfur Dioxide, said that India and China are on opposite trajectories for sulphurous pollution.Since 2007, emissions in China have declined by 75% while those in India have increased by 50%. With these changes, India has been surpassing China as the world’s largest emitter of anthropogenic SO2, the paper said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-gives-thermal-plants-new-deadlines-to-meet-emission-norms-101617388564082.html

The western state is, by far, the worst affected in India and has been driving the second wave of infections in India with record cases. On Friday, it posted 47,913cases.Click here for complete Covid-19 coverage“I am not announcing a lockdown, but definitely warning about it. I am sure we can avoid a lockdown if we decided firmly about it. We will observe for the next couple of days, if people are observing protocol strictly. But in case no such solution found, I cannot allow to go the situation out of hand,” he said.Thackeray warned that hospital beds will start falling short in next 15 days if the current spike in Covid cases continued. He also said stricter curbs will be announced in the next couple of days after speaking to political leaders and experts from various sectors.“We will issue guidelines for stricter curbs in next couple of days. Political parties, industrialists have been opposing the lockdown and warning the government against it. We are in a Catch-22 situation. If a lockdown is imposed, we face an economic crisis. At the same time, people’s lives are more important for us. Many countries including France, United Kingdom, Belgium, Brazil have impose the strict lockdown for many weeks in their fight against the second wave,” he said.Thackeray said the government had ramped up health infrastructure. “We ramped up infrastructure, by increasing the number of hospital beds to 3,75,000 from about 10,000 during the pre-Covid-19 period. The beds are filling very fast. 62% or 1,37,549 of 2,20,000 isolation beds have been occupied. 48% of 20,519 ICU beds are occupied, 25% of 62,000 oxygen beds are full. 25% of the 9347 ventilators under use for Covid-19 patients. If the rise continued there will be acute shortage of the beds. In some districts, we have started facing the shortage,” he said.“We have been advised to ramp up health care infrastructure, which we have done over the last one year. But where are we going to get doctors, nurses and health care workers, who are already under pressure and have started taken ill?” he asked.“Till now, we have administered 65 lakh COVID-19 vaccine doses, including three lakh vaccine doses yesterday,” Thackeray said.But some people are getting infected even after vaccination because they stop wearing masks, he added. People have become complacent, the chief minister noted, adding “I cannot rule out imposing lockdown if the current situation prevails.”Thackeray asked political parties not to politicise the situation.“Don’t play with people’s lives. I am ready to become a villain for protecting people,” the CM said.People should wear face masks, maintain physical distance, wash hands and avoid crowding, he appealed. “Many ask me why there is no rise in the number of cases in other states. I do not want to talk about other states, but we have been maintaining transperancy without hiding anything about the cases,” he said.According to the officials privy to developments, the government has prepared an standard operating procedure and decision about stricter norms is expected in the next two days. “The eight districts severely hit by cases have already imposed lockdown or night curfew. There would stricter norms in other districts across the state,” Thackeray said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/not-ruling-out-lockdown-says-uddhav-amid-covid-19-spike-101617388272365.html
03-04-2021||India||At Friday prayers, UP clerics push for vaccination||LucknowMuslim clerics in Lucknow on Friday held gatherings to bust misinformation surrounding the Covid-19 vaccination process and motivated people to get the doses. Taking the vaccine was the only way to arrest the spread of the virus, the clerics told people at religious gatherings in the city. “As we know, we are going through tough times. The cases are on the rise. Hence, you are requested to take all possible anti-Covid precautionary measures to keep the infection at bay. Also, those who are above 45 years should compulsorily take the jab as it’s the only way to combat the coronavirus menace,” said Maulana Khalid Rasheed Farangi Mahali, senior member of All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) and Imam of the Eidgah masjid in Lucknow. The Sunni cleric was addressing people at the Eidgah during Friday prayers, after leaders across ideological lines decided to publicise the common message.The crucial appeal comes at a time when India is firmly under the grip of the second wave of the pandemic. Infections have spiked across the country with experts saying that picking up the pace of vaccination was the best way to counter the disease.India opened up its vaccination drive to all people above 45 on Thursday. The previous two phases of the drive – the first was aimed at frontline workers and the second at those above 60, or above 45 with comorbidities – were dogged by slow rollout, teething problems, vaccine hesitancy and misinformation. India is home to roughly 175 million Muslims, who form about 14% of the country’s population.Shia leaders in the city also endorsed the appeal for vaccinations.Shia cleric Maulana Kalbe Jawad at another gathering after Friday prayers said it was “our moral responsibility” to get vaccinated. “It is our moral responsibility to get ourselves and our family members vaccinated. Hence, people are requested to get themselves vaccinated at the earliest,” he said at the Asafi Mosque in Bara Imambada complex of Lucknow.Similar requests were made at other mosques in the city as well. “We are spreading the word at almost all religious gatherings, not only in Lucknow but also in the districts like Sultanpur, Lakhimpur Khiri, Hardoi, Sitapur and others. It is the best possible way to connect to the masses,” said Shia cleric Maulana Yasoob Abbas, who is also general secretary of the All-India Shia Personal Law Board (AISPLB).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/at-friday-prayers-up-clerics-push-for-vaccination-101617388324695.html

03-04-2021||India||Jailed DU professor GN Saibaba terminated by Ram Lal Anand College||Delhi University professor GN Saibaba, sentenced to life imprisonment in 2017 by a Maharashtra court for his links with Left-wing extremist groups, was terminated from his services at Ram Lal Anand College on Thursday. While the college principal did not respond to several texts and calls seeking comment, Delhi University officials said the decision was taken as per existing rules.In a note sent to Saibaba’s family on Thursday, college principal Rakesh Kumar Gupta wrote, “The services of GN Saibaba, Assistant Professor, Ram Lal Anand College, are terminated with effect from the afternoon of 31st day of March, 2021. Three months’ salary has been paid in his Savings Bank Account.”His wife Vasantha Kumari confirmed receiving the letter and said that no reason was mentioned by the college for the termination. “We have already challenged the conviction in the Nagpur Bench of the Bombay High Court which is pending. What was the reason to terminate him in such a hurry during a pandemic? There have been cases in the past where people have been acquitted after being wrongly convicted,” she said.DU’s Dean of Colleges Balaram Pani said the college governing body took the call on the basis of existing rules. “The university has given the approval to the governing body decision which was taken because the said professor is under life imprisonment. This [the termination notice] is the rule. The governing body would have kept legal implications in mind and taken the decision accordingly. As far as an appeal to a higher court is concerned, we will see what the court says.”In March 2017, the Gadchiroli sessions court convicted Saibaba along with five others for links with Left-wing extremist organisations and “waging war” against India under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. All of them were sentenced to life imprisonment.GN Saibaba was convicted under sections 13, 18, 20, 38 and 39 of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967, and 120B (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code. The sections of the UAPA refer to committing terrorist activities, abetting, advising or inciting lawful activities, association with terror groups and inviting support for terror groups.Saibaba, a wheelchair-bound English professor, was arrested by the Maharashtra police in May, 2014, for his alleged links with top leaders of the outlawed CPI (Maoist) including Puppalla Laxman Rao alias Ganapathy.On Friday, DU Teachers’ Association President (DUTA) Rajib Ray criticised the move: “The final decision in the case is yet to come out considering the appeal. Therefore, the college and university administration should not have taken this decision.”Saibaba’s family alleged that the college’s decision is only to “mentally torture and harass” them. “We were receiving half the salary since the suspension, and the college administration wanted to stop that as well. They have taken this decision to terrorize us,” said Kumari.The family also claimed to have received several memoranda from the college over arbitrary matters. One such memorandum sent by the college in September 2019 stated: “The College has come to a conclusion that his (Saibaba’s) conduct was unbecoming of a teacher and that he was not fulfilling his obligation as a teacher. The college has arrived at the conclusion that appropriate action must be taken against Dr. Saibaba…”The college asked Saibaba to furnish a response within 21 days failing which governing body would be “free to take such action as may be appropriate .”On behalf of Saibaba, Kumari responded saying that her husband was not in “good health” and “not in a position to read and send a reply within stipulated time.” In the reply, she requested the college not to take any action as the case is not final “until all appellate remedies are exhausted.”In the letter, Kumari also raised the case of former DU professor SAR Geelani who was convicted and then acquitted in the 2001 Parliament attack case. “He was merely suspended despite his arrest in the Parliament Attack case and his employment remained under suspension despite conviction in the trial court,” Kumari said.Nandita Narain, a DU professor associated with the Committee for the Defence and Release of Dr GN Saibaba, said: “The college had been issuing multiple notices to the family. Usually, retributive action is not taken by the college while the judicial process is on.”Saibaba tested positive for Covid in February and is recovering, the family said. “His post-Covid care hasn’t been great and he is still recovering from cough and cold. We will be challenging the termination in court,” said Kumari.In a letter to the college in 2019, Kumari had written, “My husband has three dependents, me, our daughter and his mother, all of whom are completely dependent on his salary to survive including the payment of rent and other expenses.” Saibaba’s mother died last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jailed-du-professor-gn-saibaba-terminated-by-ram-lal-anand-college-101617387964098.html
03-04-2021||India||Covid-19: Record 3.6 million doses administered in one day||India administered at least 3.6 million Covid-19 vaccine doses on Thursday, the highest single-day vaccination number so far, even as the Centre said on Friday that 11 states and Union Territories, marked as “states of grave concern” because of surging infections, had not shown a commensurate increase in enforcement of containment activities.In all, at least 70 million Covid-19 vaccine doses have been administered since the nationwide immunisation drive was launched on January 16.Of the total vaccine doses administered so far, at least 30 million have been given to beneficiaries above 60 years of age, and at least 200,000 in this category have been fully vaccinated.“India has achieved a milestone in its vaccination drive with the highest ever single day figure of more than 36.7 lakh vaccination coverage recorded in the past 24 hours (Thursday). As on Day-76 of the vaccination drive (1st April, 2021), 36,71,242 vaccine doses were given. Out of which, 33,65,597 beneficiaries were vaccinated across 51,215 sessions for 1st dose and 3,05,645 beneficiaries received 2nd dose of vaccine,” the Union health ministry said on Friday.About 10 million individuals between the ages of 45 and 59 with specified comorbidities have received their first vaccine dose, and at least 40,000 of them have received the second dose.Eight states account for 59.58% of the cumulative doses given so far. Maharashtra alone accounts for 9.48% of the total doses administered in the country.Gujarat accounts for 8.96% doses, Rajasthan 8.73%, Uttar Pradesh 8.28%, West Bengal 7.88%, Karnataka 5.74%, Madhya Pradesh 5.43%, and Kerala has administered 5.07% vaccine doses so far, according to official data.The vaccination numbers reported a jump after the vaccinations were opened to all individuals above 45 years of age.The government is looking at ramping up the vaccination process further in the coming weeks, with new cases reporting a steep rise in many states of the country, according to people aware of the developments. The Centre has directed the states to make optimal use of the private sector to deliver vaccines to the eligible individuals as quickly as possible.“There is a huge private sector capable of providing vaccinations that states must make use of; provided they fulfil the criteria required to function as a Covid-19 vaccination centre. It will help optimise the process,” said Rajesh Bhushan, Union health secretary.According to the health ministry, 11 states currently have been assessed as states of grave concern as these accounted for at least 90% of the Covid-19 cases, and equal percentage of deaths till the end of March. The worst-affected states are Maharashtra, Punjab, Karnataka, Kerala, Chhattisgarh, Chandigarh, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Delhi, and Haryana, with Maharashtra, Punjab and Chhattisgarh being of particular concern.With new cases seeing a rapid increase, experts in the field say that ramping up vaccination, along with stringent containment measures, increasing Covid-19 testing, prompt contact tracing, and implementing Covid-19-appropriate behaviour is the key to defeat the virus transmission at this stage of the pandemic.“There was a lot of interest in the younger population as it is mobile and aware of the repercussions, but this group was restricted by the requirements for specified co-morbidities, need for getting a certification by a registered medical practitioner. However, it’s also important to sustain this interest and keep coverage consistently high across rural and urban areas. There will be a need to go for community outreach in a big way to cover maximum population,” said Anant Bhan, senior public health expert.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/record-3-6-million-doses-administered-in-one-day-101617387846081.html
03-04-2021||India||11 states told to increase testing, create more containment zones||The Centre on Friday told 11 states that are seeing a surge in Covid-19 cases to continuously increase testing to bring down positivity rate to 5% or less, ensure that 70% of the tests are the accurate RT-PCR ones, and create more containment zones as parts of an elaborate emergency action plan, at a meeting chaired by cabinet secretary Rajiv Gauba.The states have also been told to review death rates by hospitals and come up with a strategy to stop late admission in hospitals and non-adherence to the National Clinical Management Protocol. The union government also wants district-wise action plans with a “focus on mapping of cases, reviewing of ward/block wise indicators” and 24X7 Emergency Operations Centre. The government has also advised strict imposition of penalties on defaulters.The meeting concluded that the situation is particularly worrying in Maharashtra, Punjab, and Chattisgarh. It also recommended five “tools”: “vaccination, enhanced testing, strict containment, prompt contact tracing, and enforcement of Covid appropriate behaviour.”The meeting, attended by state chief secretaries and director generals of police, senior officials from the health ministry, ICMR, NCDC, and Niti Aayog came against the backdrop of a surge in cases across India. On Friday, India recorded 89,030 cases, the highest since September 19, 2020, according to HT’s dashboard.Maharashtra was told to take up “immediate and high effective measures” to contain active cases and the death toll through a strict clinical management protocol that was shared earlier with all states.In the meeting, union home secretary Ajay Bhalla expressed anguish and observed that even amidst the rapid surge of Covid cases, none of the states/ UTs have shown “commensurate increase in enforcement of containment activities” . Dr V. K. Paul, member Niti Ayog, emphasized that the states follow a protocol for sharing clinical and epidemiological data for detailed study of mutant strains of virus.Several experts are of the view that these so-called variants of concern or VOCs are behind the surge, especially in states such as Maharashtra and Punjab.The 11 states and union territories that attended the meeting were: Maharashtra, Punjab, Karnataka, Kerala, Chhattisgarh, Chandigarh, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Delhi and Haryana. Together, the 11, described by Gauba as “states of grave concern” accounted for 90% of Covid cases and 90.5% of deaths in the past 14 days (as on March 31). Some of them have also crossed their early reported peaks in last year.After a detailed and comprehensive review, Gauba told the states that waiting time for test results has to be reduced and Rapid Antigen Tests (RAT) should be used for screening in densely populated areas and places where new cluster of cases are emerging.The cabinet secretary also added that “all symptomatic RAT negatives be mandatorily subjected to RT-PCR tests,” according to an official release. Last month, Prime Minister Narendra Modi too, emphasized on RT-PCR tests over RAT during his meeting with the chief ministers. RT-PCR tests are the gold standard of testing and considered very accurate. Rapid Antigen Tests throw up a lot of false negatives -- identifying infected people as uninfected.The states have been also asked to ensure effective and prompt isolation of the affected in institutional facilities and daily monitoring of patients isolated at home, and the immediate transfer, if required of isolated people who test positive.Emphasizing contact tracing, Gauba and other union secretaries insisted that at least 25 close contacts should be traced for each infected person and that this be done within 72 hours of the person testing positive.The centre has also reiterated the need to define containment zones and micro containment zones to break the chain of transmission.The 11 states and union territories were told to increase the number of isolation beds, oxygen beds, ventilators/ICU beds and planned oxygen supply.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/11-states-told-to-increase-testing-create-more-containment-zones-101617387786354.html
03-04-2021||India||Covid vaccine causing deaths? AEFI experts say there’s insufficient evidence||Details of eight recent deaths following a Covid-19 vaccine shot show causality in terms of time, but there isn’t enough evidence that the vaccine itself caused the death, according to details accessed by HT.There were 79 deaths till mid March reported in individuals who took the vaccine. The national committee looking at Adverse Events Following Immunisation (AEFI) against Covid-19 approved the causality assessment for eight of these.HT has reviewed the assessment of eight deaths analysed in March (two more deaths were assessed earlier). “Three of the eight causally assessed cases have been found to have consistent causal association to vaccination, four cases have been found to have inconsistent causal association to vaccination (coincidental) and one case was found unclassifiable. None have been found to be due to the COVID-19 vaccine,” the experts said in their analysis.Of the eight deaths analysed recently, two each were reported from Maharashtra and Karnataka, and one each from Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Telangana, and Madhya Pradesh. The age group of the deceased was between 36 and 61 years; three of them were women and the rest, men.Three deaths were placed in the so-called B1 category by the experts, which means “temporal relationship is consistent but there is insufficient definitive evidence for vaccine causing event”, and four in coincidental category that is described as “underlying or emerging condition(s), or conditions caused by exposure to something other than the vaccine”, according to the panel’s definitions. One of the deaths in the B1 category was that of a 61-year-old man from Thane, Maharashtra, who took the vaccine on January 20, and suffered a sudden cardiac death 11 days after vaccination. He was known to suffer from hypertension and was on medication for the same. Sudden cardiac death is likely to be due to a cardiovascular event, the experts concluded. Covid-19 is known to trigger pro thrombotic state and cardiovascular events, they reasoned.Another death in the B1 category was of a 38-year-old man from Harda in MP, who took the jab on January 28 and also suffered a cardiac arrest. “Young patient without any cardiac risk factors, he had Covid-19 infection two months (8 weeks and 4 days) back. Covid-19 disease is known to trigger pro thrombotic state and cardiovascular events,” the committee concluded.The third B1 case was of a 36-year-old woman from Belagavi in Karnataka, who took the shot on January 22 and suffered a stroke. “Covid disease is known to lead to thrombocytopenia as well as pro-inflammatory and pro-thrombotic state. Biological plausibility exists for vaccine causing acute stroke with severe thrombocytopenia,” said the experts in their analysis.Among four coincidental cases was that of a 52-year-old woman from Aurangabad in Maharashtra, who took the jab on January 29. “Patient had documented Myocardial infarction (ECG, clinical assessment, post mortem finding of necrotic patch in inferior wall of heart). She had a preceding risk factor of hypertension,” the experts said.A 43-year-old man from Ballari in Karnataka, who took the shot on January 16, also was put in the coincidental death category. The experts said, “... he had risk factors for myocardial infarction including long standing diabetes mellitus and hypertension.”The third case in the category was that of a 52-year-old woman from Mancherial district in Telangana, who took the jab on January 19. “Patient presented with symptoms of fever with cough and difficulty in breathing, blood pressure of 210/120mmHg. Was clinically diagnosed to have accelerated HTN (hypertension) with LVF (left ventricular failure) with pneumonia,” the experts concluded.The fourth case was of a 56-year-old man from Pilibhit in Uttar Pradesh, who was inoculated on January 28. This “was a known case of coronary artery disease...,” the analysis said.The single unclassifiable case was of a man, 43, from Saran in Bihar, who was vaccinated on January 18. “There was little clinical information and no diagnosis was mentioned... Postmortem was not done,” said the experts.A Special group was created to conduct causality assessment of AEFIs following Covid-19 vaccination. The results of causality assessment done by this special group are discussed in the national AEFI committee meeting for final approval.The final analysis is sent to the Union health ministry’s immunisation division that stores data at the central level. The results of assessment for the eight cases were completed on March 9.Of the 68 million doses administered to date, AEFI have been reported in 0.028% of the cases, or 19,250 in all. “The number of people experiencing any kind of side-effect post immunisation is also very small, much less those who suffer side-effects warranting hospitalisation,” said an expert looking into AEFI cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-vaccine-causing-deaths-aefi-experts-say-there-s-insufficient-evidence-101617347882860.html

03-04-2021||Today's||A Calmer You by Sonal Kalra: Some grown-ups just don’t seem to remember this simple ‘funda’||Many years ago, some idiot had come up with the idea that ‘offence is the best defence’. Till date, many idiots are religiously following it. I saw one such respectable gentleman recently. His car that seemed being driven at a respectable speed of 80km/hr on an inside lane of my humble residential area, went over a puddle and splashed muddy water on two young girls who were walking alongside.Don’t ask me where the puddle came from, considering it’s not rainy season. Because then I’ll have to tell you how Chaddha ji gets too busy with Mrs Chaddha in the morning and forgets to switch their water motor, leading to a beautiful waterfall every morning till much after the overhead tank is full. Of course the neighbours don’t object. Don’t you know how important waterfalls are to natural beauty? All the kids in the area owe their first prize in school painting competitions to the fact that they can all draw waterfalls perfectly in landscapes.Anyway, please don’t divert my attention from the main subject. ‘Hey’, one of the girls shouted, her dress ruined badly by the muddy water. The car stopped. Correction: The car had to stop, not out of a stroke of good conscience by the driver, but because someone else had parked in such a way that he couldn’t turn. Before the girls could say anything, the water-splasher shouted loudly. “Why can’t you walk properly on the road-side. When you can see water on the road, have the common sense to walk at a distance.” I was watching from my balcony, and had every impulse to go down and enlighten him with the right definition of common sense.But then I stopped. For all the ‘we won’t take it lying down’ spirit of the youngsters today, I wanted to see how the girls would react. And then it happened. The one who seemed barely 14 raised herself to all her height, and said ‘YOU should have the sense to slow down when your car goes through a puddle.’ And then to my immense satisfaction, the other young girl added, ‘Shouting does not make you right’. I wanted to dance, but then I happened to see Chaddha ji doing aerobics and had to rush inside to throw up. I’m happy that the girls had the courage to stand up against a bully. But I’m happier at them having understood one very basic, very important rule in life — raising your voice does not make you right.This week, my heart goes out to those who have to encounter ‘loudspeaker’ people or LPs in their lives. Bosses, spouses, parents, teachers — LPs can come in any form or size. Their funda during an argument is simple and SO wrong — forget about the content, focus on the volume. Here’s how to deal with them.1. Don’t deal with them: No, I’ve not lost it, saying two contradictory sentences one after the other. The best way to deal with an LP is to walk out on him or her. The moment a person turns a healthy argument or debate into a shouting match, just refuse to be a party to it. It’s no sign of weakness. It’s a sign of maturity. Always remember that when they want to make a point: toddlers yell, adults talk. If an adult insists on behaving like a tantrum throwing kid, treat him like one and ignore his demands of attention. Tell such a yeller very firmly that you’ll be happy to resume the conversation when all the shouting stops.2. Surprise them: In situations when you can’t physically walk away from someone who’s shouting non-stop, surprise them into silence by doing something sudden and strange. Like whistle. Or switch the topic altogether and say ‘Do you think it will rain today?’ It breaks the chain of their non-stop rant and they’ll be forced to stop and think. Haan, there is a possibility that it may anger them further, so do this from a safe distance.3. Don’t be ‘them’: In other words, if you are a habitual yeller and reading this, please take a deep breath, introspect, and slap. Yourself, of course. Do realise that no matter how much you wish for it to be, the volume of human voice has precious little to do with the rightness of a person, or an argument. On the contrary, sometimes people get so put off by the one who always shouts that his right arguments are also not understood or accepted. Because it gives people a chance to brand you as the aggressive one. You don’t want that ... do you? I admit that all of us, including myself, have a secret wish to be able to punch some people in the nose without there being any consequences. But then in real life, there are always consequences. Also, no matter how important you may feel screaming your lungs out, over aggressive loudspeaker people are not popular, you see. News anchors are exceptions. And they too, mind you, don’t shout around in their personal lives. The most aggressive ones on-screen are mostly soft-spoken ones off it. Energy hi nahi bachti hogi.4. Know your rights: It’s important that irrespective of the gender, age, occupation, hierarchy etc, you are always aware of your right to not be intimidated. Throughout your life, you’ll encounter yellers who will justify their shouting by saying they did it because they want you to improve. In a lot of instances, they’ll be right in having that intention. It’s up to you to give them the confidence that you are capable of realising your fault and correcting it, without the need of being screamed at. Tell them it’ll save them the energy, you the humiliation and world the noise pollution if the volume is controlled.5. Speak up when you should: At the risk of contradicting whatever I’ve said so far, let me re-iterate that the virtue of being soft-spoken should never translate itself into staying quiet when there is a need to be heard. Very often we encounter fools who mistake silence for surrender. Speak up, clear and loud if the need be, if you come across flag bearers of the kingdom of insane and unreasonable. Just know how and when to filter noise from substance, both in what the other one says, and what you do.Sonal Kalra ne itna gyaan baanta, how about shouting out a really loud cheer? Oops.

03-04-2021||Today's||Seeking support, denying representation||In West Bengal, the Trinamool Congress (TMC) and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have announced impressive schemes for women in the hope of wooing the silent woman vote. Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has cast herself in the role of Bengal’s daughter doughtily taking on an interloper. But despite the rhetoric, women’s representation remains well below what is fair and equitable. With 17% women candidates, the TMC has done well in giving women more representation than others, but gender parity is still a long way off.The case of Kerala, a consistent top performer in development indices, is disappointing. The lists announced by the three major fronts — led by the Left, the Congress and the BJP — feature just 40 women out of 420 candidates, an abysmal nine per cent. Over decades, women have been assiduously kept out of the higher reaches of Kerala politics. There have only been eight women ministers ever in Kerala. Many will recall legendary leaders such as KR Gowri and Susheela Gopalan being sidelined by the Left Front even though they were hugely popular and were star campaigners.The same is true for Tamil Nadu, where all parties are offering substantial sops to attract women voters, but have been tardy when it comes to improving their position in the political decision-making apparatus. The All India Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK), which is in alliance with the BJP, has promised ₹1,500 to one woman in every household if voted to power, free washing machines, free gas cylinders, Amma patrol teams; other parties too have weighed in with promises of salaries for household work and special police units to investigate crimes against women. But in total, the two major alliances in the state have put up less than 13% women candidates. According to Election Commission data, since 1967, on an average, less than five per cent of Tamil Nadu’s MLAs have been women.Yet, the scenario at the local government level is very different in all these states, especially Kerala and Tamil Nadu, where women are coming to the fore and bridging the gender gap. Part of the reason is reservations, but affirmative action ends at that level. Beyond that, women encounter structural and discriminatory barriers; they are denied tickets, primarily on the ground that they supposedly lack the winnability factor. The fact that the AIADMK had a woman leader, or that the Congress continues to have strong women leaders, has made little difference.Sops such as washing machines may make life easier temporarily for women. But the patriarchal attitude is visible in the language of many leaders during the campaign — when they speak of the safety of daughters, mothers and wives as though these are the only identities a woman has.If parties want the support of women voters, then they owe it to women to create enabling conditions for them to progress through the political system and have a say in political decision-making. This can easily be done by identifying women at the local level who have done well, and throwing the party’s resources and weight behind them.India’s major parties seem to be able to organise party cadres to work for relatively untested male candidates, with ease. Surely, this can then be done for women who have worked at the grassroots instead of fobbing them off with patriarchal condescension and getting the women’s vote through freebies. This should be on the agenda of all enlightened parties. Perhaps, next time around.lalita.panicker@hindustantimes.comThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/seeking-support-denying-representation-101617458769951.html
03-04-2021||Today's||The role of MGNREGS in the climate crisis||While the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) has been a valuable employment tool and safety net, as seen in the migrant crisis, its role in building ecosystems resilient to the climate crisis is being increasingly recognised. There is now an urgent need to bring upfront the scheme’s potential in addressing matters of lives and livelihoods while combating the climate emergency. MGNREGS is climate-smart, contributing to both mitigation and adaptation. Its coping strategies lower the risks posed by the climate crisis while providing legally mandated demand-driven employment to resource-poor households.In 2020-21, an unprecedented degree of work was undertaken across 711 districts and 268,524 gram panchayats. Of the total expenditure of ₹110,900 crore, about two-thirds were on works related to natural resource management (NRM). The mammoth scale of the NRM component in MGNREGS provides a major boost to improving the productive capacity of land, water and forest resources. This helps reduce the vulnerability to climate risk as groundwater availability increases, soil fertility improves, tree cover is enhanced, drought- and flood-proofing measures are put in place.MGNREGS’s contribution towards livelihood security and creation of durable assets is well-quantified with a record of dug wells, farm ponds, check dams, desilted tanks and trees planted, updated regularly on the official website. However, studies that measure the contribution of MGNREGS towards improving the adaptive capacity of the beneficiary households have remained few and far between.A 2009 study by NH Ravindranath at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) demonstrated that the scheme was improving resilience to climate risks in some drought-prone regions. A subsequent report (2018) of the IISc, after assessing the adaptive capacity of 12 different development schemes, rated MGNREGS as foremost in effectiveness. A recent study (2021) by the Centre for Science and Environment highlights the critical import of water conservation to arrest the adverse effects of the climate crisis. It concludes that MGNREGS is the “world’s biggest adaptation programme as it harnesses the labour of people to invest in building the wherewithal to fight drought and build resilience”.The capacity of MGNREGS to deliver on the mitigation front takes into account that land is both a source and sink of carbon. Land degradation from large-scale destruction of forests, soil erosion and intensive farming accounts for about a quarter of the global greenhouse gases. Trees in agricultural landscapes, better-managed watersheds, forests and farmlands lead to enhanced carbon sequestration both above and below the ground.India’s Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) under the 2015 Paris Agreement refers to the country’s commitment to generate an additional carbon sink of 2.5-3.0 billion tonnes of CO2 equivalent by 2030. Going by present trends, target achievement will prove to be a major challenge. In the Third Biennial Update Report (BUR) submitted by the Union government to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in February, MGNREGS’s contribution to sequester carbon was assessed at 62 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent in 2017-18 from cumulative works implemented. This performance needs to be enhanced.To strengthen MGNREGS, the following needs to be done: Provide for full funding to make it truly demand-driven; deepen the scope of convergence by proactively linking farm assets with climate-smart agriculture technologies and practices; develop robust methodologies for measurement and accounting of environmental services; commission more independent studies and surveys that can quantify the scheme’s adaptation and mitigation capacity to climate risks; and factor into the feedback proformas not just the numerical count of works being undertaken but also the environmental services provided. It is time to acknowledge MGNREGS as a climate-smart green employment generation programme. In a world that will continue to warm, the rural poor will suffer its worst consequences. As a public intervention, Climate-smart MGNREGS appears to be our best bet.Rita Sharma is a former secretary, ministry of rural development and served as secretary to the National Advisory CouncilThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/the-role-of-mgnregs-in-the-climate-crisis-101617458768249.html
03-04-2021||Today's||In Myanmar, a test for India’s values||I often ask myself the question — “what sort of democracy is India?” I don’t need Freedom House to confirm that, at home, we’re only “partly free” or V-Dem to categorise us as an “elected autocracy”. To me, that’s been clear for a while. But, outside its borders, does the world’s largest democracy stand up for the principles it’s supposedly committed to? Do we support popularly elected governments, liberty, human rights, free speech and fair process abroad?If you judge by India’s response to the tragedy playing out every day for the last two months in Myanmar, the answer till last week was a resounding “No”. Our papers, no doubt, reported the unceasing resistance against military rule and even our inward-looking parochial television news channels occasionally covered it. But our government, the one institution elected to speak for us, was silent. Not a word of criticism when the numbers killed daily by the army climbed from the tens into the hundreds. Not even concern when the generals threatened to shoot their own citizens in the back or, worse, in the head.Yet this is happening next door. It’s a neighbouring country. Part of a region we want to be the acknowledged leader of. One of the more important countries embraced by Buddha’s message of love and peace first propounded at Sarnath. In short, this is our part of the world. Yet, for two months, we closed our eyes, plugged our ears and sealed our lips. We even shut our doors to refugees who fear for their lives. Since then, we’ve spoken but sotto voce. Our comments are mild, non-specific and uncritical of the army. They sound reluctant. They smack of timidity. I expected more from the world’s largest democracy.Sadly, this is not the first time we’ve turned our back on the people of Myanmar and their struggle for democracy. Our response was no different in 1988 when the army refused to recognise Aung San Suu Kyi’s first electoral triumph. Thirty years of military rule followed. The world stood by Suu Kyi. India, after giving her the Nehru Prize, tried to forget her. Yet India is almost her second country. She was at school and college in Delhi. Her mother was ambassador from 1960 to 1967 and the doyenne of the diplomatic corp. Of those dark decades when India did nothing to keep alight the flickering flame of democracy, this is what Suu Kyi said to me in 2015: “They tried to keep away from us … it saddened me that India, the largest democracy in the world, was turning its back on democracy in order to maintain good relations with the military government.”And now we’re doing it again. I know this time Suu Kyi is a fallen icon but her National League for Democracy is the freely and fairly elected government, and she is by far the most popular leader of the country. How can the world’s largest democracy forget these simple incontrovertible facts?Simply by claiming our true interest lies in retaining the support of the Myanmar junta tackling separatists and insurgents in our Northeast. I don’t deny that’s important. But democracy is even more. And our principles should always be our first concern. They must not be trumped by expedient interests.Let’s never forget what legitimises our fierce determination to defeat separatism and insurgency and keep India intact is our commitment to democracy and human rights. But if we’re deaf, dumb and blind to the brutal repression next door, we’ll diminish our integrity. That will affect how we see ourselves, it will damage how the world views us. The truth is India matters because it’s a democracy. One that has survived — even if not always flourished — in trying circumstances. That’s why we’re special. In comparison, the size of our market is of secondary importance.So, remember, today the sound of the tolling bell may come from across the border, but tomorrow it could toll for you and me.Karan Thapar is author of Devil’s Advocate: The Untold StoryThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/in-myanmar-a-test-for-india-s-values-101617458711257.html
03-04-2021||Today's||Restoring India’s political middle ground||Three tiny bones in the middle ear, the hammer, anvil and stirrup, collectively the ossicles, perform a crucial function. They keep the human body in balance. India’s political body has lost its ossicles. The middle has been overcome by vitriolic opponents. Debate is being replaced by narrative. And as a result, we have lost all balance. The blame lies with two groups: Loyalists of the Narendra Modi government, but, equally, the growing club of the anti-Modi liberal clergy. Message has become secondary to messenger: “Which side are you on?” is the only prism that matters.We are on neither side. We speak from that shrinking sliver of the middle ground, neither Modi-bhakts nor Modi-haters. There are reforms and initiatives of the Modi government that we agree with, but also actions that we disagree with. For 20 years, we have brought a non-ideological, problem-solving approach to urban change, working with political dispensations across party lines. While we haven’t always been successful, we have always made our case in an environment of vibrant democratic debate. But the corrosive discourse we are seeing now is dangerous. Serious debates are getting trivialised into a Modi litmus test. Take one example — the recently-released Freedom House report on Democracy for 2021. It’s a serious report, from an institution with a rock-solid reputation. There are 25 questions spanning two categories: Political rights and civil liberties. A key aspect of the methodology is assessing changes from the prior year. This year, India’s score slipped to 67, from 75 in 2020, moving it from “free” to “partly free”. But peel the layers back a bit. India’s big drop was in civil liberties, to 33 from 40 last year. But here’s the rub — the same Freedom House report gives Hong Kong a higher score (37) than India on civil liberties. The scoring on some questions seems perplexing. For example, on “Is there freedom for non-governmental organisations, particularly those that are engaged in human rights and governance-related work?”, Hong Kong rates higher than India.Given all that’s happened in Hong Kong, it’s ludicrous for even the most trenchant critic of the Modi regime to agree with these assessments. A healthy debate would have been enlightening. Instead, the report became fodder for a face-off — between a liberal caucus and the Modi regime. No one on the liberal side flagged these contradictions, possibly because it’s inconvenient and doesn’t suit their narrative. But those representing the ruling regime are also to blame — for rolling out the anti-national trope or suggesting that we ought to create our own democracy index.As a result, that space in the middle, for a reasoned debate, shrank once again. And even before the dust settles, the next issue-du-jour is breaking news, for the scuffle to begin anew.This scorched earth approach may be acceptable to these warring factions, because they are fighting a bigger battle over legitimacy. Modi’s critics claim that democracy is endangered in India. As evidence, they point to the attempts by the Modi regime to bully/undermine/co-opt various institutions and voices — the media, courts, business community, opinion-shapers. Has the government attempted to overreach? Only a rabid Modi-bhakt would disagree.But the right measure is not what was attempted. Which regime wouldn’t want a friendly media? When is it that those in power haven’t attempted to muzzle or nudge other arms of accountability? Fortunately, the messy plumbing of the State not only leaks like a sieve but is often too dysfunctional to be effective. The right measure is, therefore, not the attempt itself, but whether it succeeded. In a vibrant democracy, failed attempts result in public backlash, thereby strengthening the voices of the Opposition. Take the Disha Ravi case. Did the government attempt to overreach? Yes, and it was Exhibit A for ineptness. But what was the response? Fiery opposition and public opprobrium ending with a harsh put-down by the courts. The liberals proclaimed yet another example of the Modi government muzzling free speech to pronounce a further erosion of democratic values in India. Viewed through a different prism, however, one could reach a different conclusion — that there are enough voices of opposition, and importantly, agile alliances, to thwart any attempt to silence critics. And, therefore, that democracy is alive and kicking in India.Take another example — the farm law debates. We see coalitions and cleavages, symbolism and squeeze-where-it-hurts tactics on display from both sides, the farmers’ network and the government. And there are upcoming state elections to politically test the competing messages. What more can one ask for? Whichever way the farm law debate settles, it should surely be considered a resounding win for Indian democracy.This battle for legitimacy is being fuelled by a dual monopoly in the intellectual-political landscape. The liberals claim, with merit, that the Modi-led Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is acquiring hegemonic control over India’s electoral democracy. But liberals ignore that they hold similar hegemonic sway over the global narrative. Modi’s electoral hegemony is public. The liberal hegemony is invisible. In this asymmetric intellectual war, the liberals have a well-established, influential global network spanning academia, think-tanks, media and opinion-makers that gets instantly activated. The conservative right has nothing close to this. As to the BJP’s efforts to construct its own ecosystem, it’s debatable how long this will take to bear fruit, if at all.Confronted by the BJP’s electoral hegemony, the liberals seem to have shifted the goalposts — to measure democracy beyond electoral processes. While such an approach is intellectually valid, the timing of this shift is questionable, coinciding with the BJP’s 2019 election victory — the democracy-between-elections theme was barely mentioned earlier.Also, they are on a slippery slope to question the value of elections, since India’s voters, more than any liberal network, have been the real sentinels of our democracy. After all, it was the electorate which ensured that India walked back from the brink of the Emergency in 1977. Or, more recently, when it displayed remarkable political sophistication in Delhi’s state elections of 2020, bringing back the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) with a 67-seat majority, barely seven months after giving all seven Members of Parliament (MPs) of the city to the BJP.India faces complex challenges on a variety of fronts. Each of these needs equally complex solutions that can only emerge from substantive, nuanced debates. These exchanges can be intense, even bare-knuckled, pitting one set of ideas against another. But this can only happen when India has a large and vibrant political middle. These political ossicles, the hammer and the anvil to forge the ideas, and the stirrups to propel India forward, are critical to preserve and nurture our democratic culture.Swati Ramanathan and Ramesh Ramanathan are co-founders of Jana GroupThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/restoring-india-s-political-middle-ground-101617458709560.html
03-04-2021||Today's||As Covid returns, India must not repeat the mistakes of 2020||There is a familiar paranoia in the air as India confronts a sudden surge in Covid-19 cases. And we are in danger of making some of the same mistakes all over again — errors that much of the western world continues to make, and that we should have learnt better from, by now. The most colossal misstep is that we are being pulled back into thinking in the lexicon and language of lockdowns.My extensive reporting travels across India through the year of the pandemic convinced me of one thing. Indefinite shutdowns — of housing societies, neighbourhoods, schools, cities and, finally, borders — is a counterproductive move that ravages the economy, punishes the poorest of citizens and offers no sustainable solution to the spread of the virus. It would be akin to believing you can get fitter by starving, instead of adopting a balanced diet. You may briefly shed kilos rapidly, only to put them all back on again and acquire a host of other ailments, physical, emotional and psychological, along the way. Lockdowns have — or should have — a singular logic, which is to buy breathing space for the health care system. The 2020 national lockdown’s initial purpose was to allow for stadiums or other large spaces to be converted into makeshift hospitals, ancillary frontline staff to be mobilised, and enough oxygen to be procured. They were meant to be short and finite preparatory interventions, not repetitive, draconian, policed diktats that just keep us further and further away from normalcy, and basically become ways of penalising those who can least afford it.A year on, we also know more than we did previously. We know we should not go racing to the hospital in a panic if our pulse oximeter throws up favourable numbers; we know that we mostly need high-flow oxygen and not ventilators; and we know that all therapeutic medicine is by trial and error, mostly paracetamol meets steroids, the latter strictly when needed. And we know or should know that testing positive should not be spoken of as if it’s the end of the world — despite the surge, India’s recovery rate is still close to 95%. The most dramatic difference between 2020 and 2021, of course, is that vaccines are now available. And this is where our urgent focus should be, rather than on an alarmist daily tabulation of how many people have tested positive. We should allow data to lead us towards a productive direction. For instance, we know that eight states account for nearly 85% of all new Covid-19 cases. Among these, we know that more than 60% are from Maharashtra. It’s a no-brainer that we need to universalise vaccination coverage for all adults in these hot zones. Taking an aggregated, pan-India approach to the vaccine rollout, when some states clearly need this more than others, is short-sighted. We are wasting time debating whether India needs to halt its acclaimed vaccine maitri programme and focus inwards; the fact is we are inoculating well below production capacity. And a little over 6% of vaccines are being wasted nationally. This is nothing short of criminal. While there may be two views on making a vaccine mandatory, the best way to address vaccine hesitancy is to link its requirements with economic and social activity, whether travel, dining in closed and crowded places, or catching a movie. Once enough people realise that the only way to reclaim our lives is to take the jab, self-indulgent drawing room debates by the elite will be forced to draw to a close. Sure, there have been instances when people have contracted the virus a few days after taking the shot. But the vaccine guarantees protection against severe disease and death. It prevents infections in a significant proportion of cases (70-80% for the vaccines in use in India) and ensures that you dont fall gravely ill or need hospitalisation. Thus, if we inoculate enough of our population, especially in the cities, where Covid-19 is most prevalent, and target the 10 worst-hit Indian cities, the pressure on the hospital system will reduce by itself. As the country that produces 60% of the world’s vaccines, and as a leader in mass immunisation programmes, this should be more than doable for us. But a conventional, bureaucratic mindset appears to be holding us back. The vaccination programme needs to be reset and targeted. At least three new global vaccines that have Indian partners need to be allowed in without the demand for bridging trials. Virologists such as Dr Shahid Jameel have underlined the urgent need for unlocking Johnson & Johnson, Sputnik and Novavax from these regulatory hurdles, pointing out that it is wasteful to be lost in percentage point debates over efficacy. As long as the vaccines are safe and provide protection against mortality and serious illness, that’s all that counts. This is where our Covid-19 conversation must be centred — in the future. Not in revisiting ideas like lockdowns that are detrimental to the health of nations.
