But they will have to share the information immediately with the command centre and display the availability of beds publicly, the state government announced.In an order issued here, additional chief secretary (medical health and family welfare) Amit Mohan Prasad said, “The amendment in admission process shall continue till June 30. The private hospitals will keep 10% of the total Covid beds for admission via Covid command centres.” In other words, 90% of the beds in private hospitals have been reserved for direct admission.Private hospitals will share the information immediately after admission with the command centre and update the same at 8am and 4pm, apart from displaying the same outside the hospital for common people to know. Patients can reach private hospitals by their own arrangement but, if needed, the command centre shall make an ambulance available. Private hospitals will charge only the prescribed fee from the patients.At the government hospitals, medical colleges and private medical colleges, 70% of admission in Covid wards will be done via the command centre and 30% of the admission can be done on the basis of an emergency situation by the institutions. These hospitals and medical colleges will also display the status of admission outside the campus/building.All patients requesting free treatment will be admitted via the command centre, said the order. Inspections will be carried out to check if the Covid-19 treatment protocol is being followed.With a surge in Covid-19 cases, the patients were facing hardship in getting beds in hospitals due to the bed allotment order under which the patient had to get registered at ICCC and obtain the referral letter from the chief medical officer (CMO) for admission in the government and private hospitals. The Opposition parties had slammed the state government over the issue. Even BJP MPs and MLAs had demanded revision of the bed allotment order. On Wednesday, the UP Human Rights Commission had directed the state government to revise the bed allotment order as people were being harassed. Lucknow district magistrate Roshan Jacob had also sent a letter to ACS (medical health and family welfare) Amit Mohan Prasad, demanding revision of the order.The district administration will set up counters to receive application for free admission in the government hospitals and medical colleges, he said. The details of the beds in various categories of the private hospitals and rates will be published in the dailies.Hospitals asked to furnish oxygen consumption detailsHospitals in the state have been asked to furnish details of oxygen consumed by them. According to an order by the director general (medical health), hospitals need to give details of oxygen they receive and use per day. This is being done to make an assessment of oxygen consumption and ensure the supply remains in accordance with the demand or need.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/admission-rules-amended-for-covid-19-patients-in-up-101619115830964.html

22-04-2021||Mumbai||Fresh Covid-19 restrictions come into force in Maharashtra||Fresh restrictions on travel, attendance in offices and wedding functions announced by the Maharashtra government to check the Covid-19 spread came into force on Thursday night.Maharashtra, facing an unprecedented surge in coronavirus cases, is already under severe restrictions since April 14 and the fresh "lockdown-like" curbs were announced on Wednesday to break the chain of viral transmission in the state.Prohibitory orders, banning assembly of five or more people at once place, are in force till 7 am on May 1, while non-essential activities are not being allowed.Essential services, including grocery stores, are permitted to operate only between between 7 and 11 am.The new restrictions under the government's `Break- the-Chain' programme came into force at 8 pm on Thursday and will remain effective till 7 am on May 1.In the cabinet meeting this week, several ministers demanded a total lockdown for 15 days to curb the rising Covid-19 cases in Maharashtra, the state worst hit by the pandemic in the country.But Chief MinisterUddhav Thackeray decided against imposing a total shutdown, apparently after Prime Minister Narendra Modi's address to the nation where he said a lockdown should be the "last resort".Now, with the new curbs the government has decided to reduce presence of people on the streets and in public transport.According to an order issued by Chief Secretary Sitaram Kunte, government offices - central, state and local authorities - will work with 15 per cent attendance except those in emergency services directly connected to management of the pandemic.Other offices, allowed to operate as per the existing rules, will function with 15 per cent strength or five people, whichever is more, stated the order.Only government personnel and those in emergency services would be allowed to use suburban trains, metro and mono services in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region, it said.All those engaged in medical services - doctors, nurses, paramedics, lab technicians and clinical staff - will be issued travel passes on basis of identity cards.However, patients needing medical treatment and specially-abled persons can travel in trains, the order said.Municipal and state transport buses will operate at 50 per cent capacity with no standing passengers.Marriage ceremonies have to be conducted as a single event in a single hall not extending beyond two hours with maximum of 25 person in attendance, the order said, adding violation will attract a fine of ₹50,000.For inter-city and inter-district travel bylong- distance trains and buses, the local Railways/state transport authorities will ensure screening of passengers, the order said.Passengers of private buses (who are allowed to travel) will have to quarantine themselves at home for 14 days after they reach their destination. Bus operators will have to stamp the passengers' hands to indicate they are supposed to stay at home for 14 days.On Thursday, police vans made rounds of the main streets in Mumbai asking people on the loudspeaker to stay home and avoid crowding.Police have put up barricades at the entry and exit gates of suburban railway stations to prevent unauthorised people from travelling in local trains.Police personnel manned the streets to check motorists and cars for the yellow, green and red stickers which are to be used for specific purpose while moving around during the period of restrictions.On Thursday, Maharashtra reported 67,013 fresh coronavirus cases, taking the tally to 40,94,840, while 568 more patients succumbed to the infection, said a health department official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/fresh-covid-19-restrictions-come-into-force-in-maharashtra-101619115481093.html
22-04-2021||Noida||Noida, Ghaziabad’s home chefs, Good Samaritans come to the rescue of Covid patients in home isolation||Noida/Ghaziabad: With Covid-19 cases being reported from almost every locality, home cooks and Good Samaritans are stepping up and delivering meals to patients in home isolation. Sector 50 resident Parul Sachdeva, 50, has been getting over 30 to 40 calls ever since she started delivering food for Covid patients two weeks ago.“I get calls from Covid patients who want customised meals. Some want to have something light, while others just want soups. I serve them for ₹100 per meal. For senior citizens, the service is free,” said Sachdeva. She is listed on online delivery platforms to make deliveries across Noida and Greater Noida.Sector 29 resident Ashutosh Bhardwaj also started delivering home cooked food to Covid patients in home isolation last week on Friday. Bhardwaj was working in the hospitality sector in Rajasthan but due to coronavirus-induced curbs last year, he returned to Noida.“Since two weeks, there has been an explosion of Covid cases in the country. Being a hotel management professional, I thought doing something for the patients as I was just idle at home. I circulated a message on our local WhatsApp groups that I can deliver home cooked meals at residences of Covid patients in Noida. Soon, I was bombarded with calls,” said Bhardwaj. The 39-year-old has been making around 10 food deliveries per day since last week. “After a lockdown was imposed in Delhi, two of my helpers left for their home town and I was left with just one. Moreover, due to the night curfew in the district, I am only able to deliver lunch,” he said.Vishal Srivastava, a resident of Sector 137, was delivering home cooked food to his office colleague and his wife who got infected in the first week of April. “Now I am making around five deliveries around my apartment per day for ₹100 per thali which includes lentils, rice, roti and a mix vegetable with curd,” he said.Srivastava is one of the volunteers who signed up for an initiative started by Anupriya Singh, a home cook from Panchsheel Enclave, Delhi. “I decided to compile a list of all home cooks across Delhi-NCR who could volunteer to deliver meals for Covid patients. The list was circulated on social media last Friday and people across Noida, Ghaziabad, Gurgaon and Delhi got connected,” said Singh who runs a platform for home cook called House of Kitchen.Indirapuram resident Farha Khadija also got connected through the initiative. “After my contact was circulated, I have been delivering 20 thalis per day to home isolation patients in Indirapuram, Vaishali and Vasundhara area. I have had to refuse to about 30 other queries as I do not have food in such a large quantity,” she said.Then there are those who do not cook thalis or light food but deliver snacks and supplements.Rajeev Malik, a resident of Sector 29, delivers snacks and Vitamin C supplements for free on Sundays.“I do not have resources to cook food but I wanted to do my bit for those affected by coronavirus. Hence, I decided to put together a small snacks packet with biscuits, some namkeen, glucose packet and vitamin C supplement tablets. However, soon after my number was circulated through WhatsApp groups, I started getting 75-80 calls a day,” said the 42-year-old who delivers the packets personally across Noida.Meanwhile, Kavi Nagar resident Mayank Chaudhary who runs a volunteer organisation Youth Network, delivers free food in Ghaziabad.“We spread the word about the initiative through social media on Sunday and since then we have been getting over 200 calls a day. We always ask callers to share their medical reports as we had some cases where people call just for the free food,” he said. The deliveries are contactless as the food packets are placed outside the house of the patients. He has been making deliveries in Kavi Nagar, Nehru Nagar, Raj Nagar, Raj Nagar extension and Crossing Republik. Their volunteers also try to deliver medicines and other essentials to home isolation patients, which are chargeable. “We have tied up with a wholesale pharmaceutical manufacturer and try to deliver medicines prescribed to Covid patients in home isolation that are available. If the Covid patient also needs essentials, we deliver that as well. However, only the deliveries are free for this service and the cost of medicines and essentials has to be borne by the patients,” said Mayank.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-ghaziabad-s-home-chefs-good-samaritans-come-to-the-rescue-of-covid-patients-in-home-isolation-101619115651507.html
22-04-2021||Noida||Pregnant Covid positive women left with limited options in Noida||It took two days for Noida Sector 31 resident Utsav Kumar to find a bed for his pregnant and Covid positive wife Aditi Mittal and that too in Delhi.“She had a fever and her oxygen level was down to 93. She was earlier admitted at Sharda Hospital in Greater Noida but we had to remove her from there as the staff was overworked and there was no one to look after her. We also tried to get admission at Government Institute of Medical Science (GIMS) hospital but no beds were available there as well,” said Kumar.In Gautam Budh Nagar, currently three hospitals -- GIMS, Sharda hospital and Fortis hospital -- are admitting Covid-19 pregnant women.Due to changes in their bodies and immune systems, pregnant women can be badly affected by some respiratory infections, according to the World Health Organization. Dr Nimmi Chutani, head of gynaecology department in Sharda Hospital admitted that the staff were under pressure. “We are getting at least four to five pregnant Covid patients at the hospital everyday and have conducted deliveries of three such women this month as well,” she said.At GIMS, officials say that there is a shortage of beds for all Covid patients. “The hospital currently has only 215 beds but there are 280 patients that we have to attend to. This includes four pregnant women,” said Prof. (Brig) Rakesh Gupta. He added that last year, pregnant women who tested positive for Covid were mostly asymptomatic. “This time, most pregnant women who test positive are showing symptoms. The situation is severe this time around,” he said.Dr Neha Mishra, associate professor at the department of obstetrics and gynaecology, GIMS, said that the hospital helped deliver three babies to Covid patients in the past three weeks who were also found to be Covid positive. She, however, could not confirm whether the virus was passed on from the mother. “We are getting four to five pregnant Covid positive patients per day but not all of them need to be admitted. Since the surge in Covid cases, we have helped eight such patients deliver,” said Dr Mishra.Officials at Fortis Hospital Noida also said that they are getting at least four to five Covid positive pregnant patients every day. “Since the hospital staff is overworked, we advise most of the mild and asymptomatic patients to take phone/video call consultations from our doctors so that they stay safe and can prevent spread of the virus further,” said Dr Aradhna Singh, senior consultant at department of gynaecology, Fortis Hospital Noida. The hospital has 100 beds in its Covid ward and there are two isolation beds in the labour room for Covid positive pregnant women.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/pregnant-covid-positive-women-left-with-limited-options-in-noida-101619115650949.html
22-04-2021||Delhi||Oxygen supply exhausted in 6 hospitals, 7 others have under 5 hrs left: Manish Sisodia tells Harsh Vardhan||Six hospitals in the national capital have exhausted their oxygen supply while seven others have less than five hours of oxygen left, Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia told Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan on Thursday.In a letter to the Union health minister, Sisodia pointed out that six hospitals — Saroj Super Speciality Hospital, Shanti Mukund, Tirath Ram Shah Hospital, UK Nursing Home, Rathi Hospital and Santom Hospital, have exhausted their oxygen supply.The hospitals that have less than five hours of oxygen supply include — Baba Saheb Ambedkar Hospital, BLK Hospital, Holy Family Hospital, Okhla, Indraprastha Apollo Hospital, Max Superspeciality Hospital, Patparganj, Venketeshwara Hospital and Sri Balaji Action Medical Institute, Sisodia pointed out."Police and senior officials of the administration in Uttar Pradesh and Haryana are stalling the tankers carrying oxygen, delaying the tankers from reaching Delhi hospitals on time," Sisodia said in the letter."I urge you to ensure that the oxygen allocated for Delhi by the Centre reaches there without any delay to save lives of the patients," he added.Several small hospitals in the city struggled to replenish oxygen supply for coronavirus patients on Thursday morning, even as some big healthcare facilities received fresh stock overnight.The Centre on Thursday directed states to ensure uninterrupted production and supply of medical oxygen and its transport along inter-state borders and said the district magistrate and superintendent of police of the district concerned will be held responsible if there is any violation of its order.The directive under the stringent Disaster Management Act 2005 was issued by Union Home Secretary Ajay Bhalla in the wake of reports that some states blocked supply of medical oxygen to other states amid the sudden spike in coronavirus cases and demand for it.With several private and government hospitals in Delhi running low on medical oxygen for Covid-19 patients, the Centre raised the national capital's oxygen quota from 378 metric tonnes to 480 metric tonnes on Wednesday.Sisodia, however, said the increased quota has either not reached Delhi or there have been considerable delay.Meanwhile, the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) appointed two senior bureaucrats as nodal officers to ensure smooth movement of tankers and facilitate oxygen supply to city hospitals, and directed the Delhi Police to provide security logistics from manufacturers' sites to various health facilities here.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/oxygen-supply-exhausted-in-6-hospitals-7-others-have-under-5-hrs-left-delhi-deputy-chief-minister-manish-sisodia-tells-union-health-minister-harsh-vardhan-101619115184083.html
22-04-2021||Delhi||3 IAS officers to ensure oxygen supply to Delhi hospitals, police to provide security to tankers||As Delhi hospitals faced a severe oxygen crisis for the third consecutive day, the DDMA roped in three senior bureaucrats on Thursday to ensure a smooth movement of tankers and facilitate oxygen supply to the needy establishments, and directed the police to provide the security logistics from the manufacturers' sites to various health facilities in the city.The move came hours after Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia alleged that the police in Uttar Pradesh and Haryana were blocking oxygen transportation to Delhi and urged the Centre to ensure normal supply even if that meant taking the help of paramilitary forces.The Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) also set up a round-the-clock control room to redress grievances and complaints from the city hospitals within 30 minutes.All the hospitals will have to appoint an audit committee for supervising and rationalising the use of medical oxygen.Several small hospitals in the city struggled to replenish their oxygen supplies for coronavirus patients throughout the day.Sisodia wrote to Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan in the evening, saying six hospitals in the national capital have exhausted their oxygen supply while seven have less than five hours of oxygen remaining.In his order, Chief Secretary Vijay Dev, who is also the chairman of the DDMA executive committee, said the Delhi Police would keep a record of the entry and exit of all oxygen tankers through various checkposts to monitor their movement.The police will immediately share the record of entry and exit of the tankers at the checkposts with the control room, the order said.The liquid medical oxygen will be distributed among all hospitals run by the Centre, the Delhi government as well as private players under the overall supervision and control of Officer on Special Duty (Delhi health department) Ashish Verma.He will be assisted by two other senior IAS officers -- Vijay Bidhuri and Udit Prakash Rai. Rai will be responsible for ensuring a smooth and seamless movement of the tankers till the borders of Delhi and sorting out all the issues pertaining to the suppliers, the states and the Centre, Dev said in the order.Bidhuri will be responsible for controlling, coordinating and facilitating the supply of oxygen to the hospitals.According to the DDMA order, Delhi Police's Special Commissioner (operations) Muktesh Chander will function as the nodal officer, supervising the green corridor provided to the tankers.He will provide all help, support and security logistics as regards the movement of the tankers from the manufacturers' sites to the hospitals.The DDMA said there will be a help desk at the control room, which will be manned by an SDM-level officer and eight other officials for redressing the grievances and complaints from the hospitals."If the grievances are not redressed within half an hour, Bidhuri will look into it," it added.The hospitals will also appoint nodal officers, who will be available round the clock to redress grievances related to oxygen supply, the order said.Amid a shortage of medical oxygen being faced by the hospitals, the Centre increased Delhi's quota from 378 MT to 480 MT per day on Wednesday.Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has said all the suppliers of medical oxygen, who provide Delhi its quota, are based in other states. The government is also trying to airlift medical oxygen from Odisha.A sudden spurt in Covid-19 cases and a high positivity rate have led to a large number of hospital admissions.Many of the patients are on supplemental oxygen and under ICU care and this has led to a quantum jump in the medical oxygen requirement of the hospitals, the DDMA said.In many cases, the existing contractual arrangements have either been disturbed or a hospital's oxygen requirement has exceeded the contractual quantity, causing a "widespread disruption" in the supply chain that has led to a "precarious situation", the DDMA order said."Local supply side disruptions in the neighbouring states is leading to wide variation in day-to-day delivery of oxygen to Deihi," it added.Allocation and supply of oxygen to all health establishments will be strictly regulated in accordance with the allocation orders issued by the government from time to time, the DDMA said.The order will specify the daily allocation in respect of all health establishments as well as the inter-se distribution amongst different suppliers, it added.Delhi logged 24,638 fresh Covid-19 cases and 249 deaths due to the viral disease on Wednesday, while the positivity rate stood at 31.28 per cent, meaning almost every third sample tested positive, amid a growing clamour for oxygen and hospital beds in the city.On Tuesday, the city had recorded 28,395 cases and 277 fatalities, both highest since the outbreak of the pandemic. The positivity rate was 32.82 per cent, also the highest so far.The city has reported over 1,350 deaths due to the deadly virus in the last seven days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/3-ias-officers-to-ensure-oxygen-supply-to-delhi-hospitals-police-to-provide-security-to-tankers-101619114917281.html

22-04-2021||Gurugram||25MLD sewage plant in the works for Manesar||To increase sewage treatment capacity in Manesar, the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) will start constructing a sewage treatment plant (STP) having a capacity of 25 million litres per day (MLD) from July, said officials. “This new STP will focus on sewage treatment of all villages falling on the stretch from Manesar till Naharpur Kasan village. This will be in addition to the 50 MLD STP already functional for Industrial Model Township area of Manesar,” said a senior GMDA official, requesting anonymity. The authority has invited tenders for the project and given time till May 11 for companies to submit proposals. However, due to the prevailing Covid-19 situation and lack of labour force, the official cited above said that on-ground work is likely to get delayed, and start by July, with a target to finish the project by December 2022. The official cited above said that they have decided to undertake the work on behalf of the health department, following a request in this regard. “The public health department is supposed to provide sewerage facilities in villages of Manesar region under Mahagram Yojana, but they did not have land available with them. So, GMDA is providing the land while the public health department will bear the cost, which is estimated to be around ₹31.76 crore,” the official said. Meanwhile, the authority is also working on a project for using treated water from the Common Effluent Treatment Plant in Manesar IMT for horticulture work in green belts and industrial purposes. A proposal in this regard was prepared by the Haryana State Industrial and Infrastructure Development Corporation (HSIIDC) and tabled during the 8th authority meeting that was held on April 9. Around 45-48 MLD of treated wastewater will be made available by GMDA for this region, said officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/25mld-sewage-plant-in-the-works-for-manesar-101619113013231.html
22-04-2021||Gurugram||Civil Hospital suspends OPD, non-emergency surgeries||To divert the maximum resources towards managing Covid-19 cases, all non-emergency surgeries and out-patient department (OPD) services for non-emergency cases at the Civil Hospital will be suspended from Friday, doctors familiar with the developments said on Thursday.“Due to increasing Covid-19 cases, we have been asked by our higher authorities to temporarily stop OPD services for dermatology, dental, general surgery. Routine surgeries will not take place in the hospital as we are completely focusing on managing Covid-19 cases,” said Dr Manish Rathi, deputy medical superintendent, Civil Hospital, which is the only major government hospital in the city.Senior doctors said that the move will allow them to increase bed capacity for treating Covid-19 positive and suspected patients. According to health department data, Gurugram’s active caseload stands at over 18,000 cases. The rate of recovery in Gurugram is at 79.96%, while the fatality rate is at 0.43%.“This week, we were able to augment the beds in the hospital for treating Covid-19 patients. We now have separate wards for positive patients and suspected patients. Earlier, we were only treating suspected patients. We have 21 beds for positive patients, which will be increased to 30 by next week, while 20 more beds will be added for suspected cases. By stopping the non-emergency surgeries, we are able to divert those resources also for the treatment of Covid-19 patients,” said a senior doctor, requesting anonymity.Doctors said that on average, 20 surgeries take place every week, but these will now be delayed.Dr Sanjay Narula, consultant, general surgery, Civil Hospital, said, “All routine surgeries have been cancelled but emergency cases like caesarean deliveries will be conducted. The surgeries for issues such as hernia, which were scheduled, have been put on a wait list for now. With both general and orthopaedic surgeries, around 20 surgeries per week (estimated) will get affected and patients put on a wait list.”He said that patients have also stopped visiting the OPD due to fear of rising cases. “Inflow of patients in OPD has reduced to almost one-third of the usual. I would usually see around 100-125 patients daily in OPD, but now, it has reduced to around 40. People are scared to visit hospitals,” said Narula.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/civil-hospital-suspends-opd-non-emergency-surgeries-101619113012665.html

Stating that more than half of the cases in the state were reported from Gurugram, Faridabad and Sonepat, Vij said that 800 Covid-19 beds will be added to facilities in Gurugram and a nodal officer would be appointed to ensure there is no shortage of oxygen and other equipment. The health minister also refuted allegations that Haryana was denying oxygen supply to any state. “We are following the allocation made by the Central government, by which 140 metric tonnes (MT) of oxygen will be supplied to Delhi, 80 MT to Haryana and 50 MT to Punjab,” said Vij.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/markets-shops-selling-non-essentials-to-shut-from-6pm-101619113011855.html
22-04-2021||Gurugram||Crematorium staff raise health concerns over violations by hospitals||Staff at the Sector 32 and Madanpuri crematoriums alleged that a few private hospitals were sending bodies of Covid-19 victims wrapped in bedsheets, instead of body bags, as mandated to prevent the spread of the virus. They said that rules were violated in at least three instances over the last two days.Sharing footage of one such incident on Thursday, staff at the Mokshdham cremation ground in Sector 32 raised health concerns, to themselves as well as the public, due to the violations. They said that ambulance drivers were also not wearing personal protective equipment (PPE) and taking the help of family members to carry the bodies.In the footage, a copy of which is with Hindustan Times, the driver of an ambulance is seen entering the crematorium in an ambulance and placing a body on one of the platforms without following any precautions.Sandeep Sharma, the in-charge of Mokshdham cremation ground in Sector 32, said, “In one instance, family members (of a Covid-19 victim) who had come in private cabs did not take any precautionary measures despite a Covid death in the family. They are at risk of getting infected as they were standing close to the body before handing it over to us.”As per the protocols, a body is kept in a crematorium near the platform for 30 minutes for people to pay their respects from a distance.Ashish Singla, chief medical officer (CMO), MCG, said they will issue a notice to the hospitals concerned to ensure such violations are not repeated. “We have already passed directions to not send any corpse without body bags. A body cover with a transparent face area should be used. The driver is instructed to wear PPE kits and no family members are allowed to touch the body. Strict action will be taken against people violating the protocols,” he said.Singla said the hospitals have procured these body bags but small nursing homes are still not fully equipped to handle the bodies of Covid-19 patients. There is no shortage across the market and each hospital should keep at least five bags in case of emergency, he said.Vinod Kumar, a staffer at the Madanpuri cremation ground, said that every day, there is at least one such violation. “All day, we are handling and cremating bodies, but we do not want to risk our lives. The hospitals should be held responsible for such negligent and careless approach,” he said.Sharma said that in one instance, the body of a Covid-19 victim was placed in a public area in the vicinity of the crematorium, following which they complained to the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) and the hospital that sent the ambulance.Family members of Covid-19 victims said they were unaware of the protocol, but admitted that they were not allowed to travel to the crematorium along with the bodies. “We learned after coming here that there is such a protocol and we are not supposed to handle the body or touch it. We performed the last rites standing at a distance,” said a resident of New Palam Vihar, who was performing the last rites of his elder brother at the Sector 32 facility.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/crematorium-staff-raise-health-concerns-over-violations-by-hospitals-101619113011237.html
22-04-2021||Gurugram||Hospitals fall short of oxygen, supply from Bhiwadi resumes||Hospitals in the city reported a shortage of oxygen on Thursday and sought help from the state, due to an increase in consumption owing to the sharp spike in serious Covid-19 cases over the last two weeks and the supplier in Bhiwadi of Rajasthan halting shipments due to a ban by the state government.“1 hour oxygen left in Fortis Gurugram. Tanker from Bhiwadi not allowed to come to Haryana. We cater to Pt from all India they cannot pay price for a political war,” Dr Rahul Bhargava, director, bone marrow transplant programme, Fortis Memorial Research Institute, Gurugram, tweeted at 4.11pm on Thursday.Officials of the administration said that the supplier in Bhiwadi resumed operations on Thursday after discussions with the Rajasthan government. “There was a delay on the part of the hospital to inform us about the situation. The hospital had a tie-up with the Bhiwadi plant. To tackle the situation, the deputy commissioner coordinated with the supplier and arranged the oxygen required by the hospital,” said Rajeev Arora, additional chief secretary, health department.The management of the Fortis Memorial Research Institute later confirmed that they received the supply. “Tanker from Bhiwadi has reached averting a serious crisis,” a statement from the hospital read.However, other hospitals in the city said that a crisis is looming.An official from Artemis Hospitals said, “Yes, there is an acute shortage. We are living one day at a time with 24-hour oxygen (supply) at any given time. Refilling with liquid oxygen is a challenge for continuous supply; even oxygen cylinders are not available. It is leading to huge stress on the medical staff. They are getting demoralised as patient care is adversely affected.”Anil khatana, head of operations, W Pratiksha Hospital in Sector 56, said that the administration has asked them to increase the number of beds, but they are unable to fulfil the demand of patients already undergoing treatment. “There has been increase in the demand and if we add more beds, we will not be able to meet fill the requirement. Upgrading infrastructure with the current situation is not possible. We used to get 90 cylinders refilled twice a week but now, we need the same twice a day due to the number of patients,” he said. Dr Vikram Singh, director of Aarvy hospital in Civil Lines and Sector 90, said that they are reeling under an acute shortage of oxygen cylinders. “We need at least 90 oxygen cylinders for our Covid-19 patients but are getting a supply of hardly 10 a day. Two suppliers have stopped supply due to the increased demand. If the situation remains the same for the next few days, the number of causalities will increase. We are somehow making do at present, as we have an oxygen generation plant,” he said.The short supply comes at a time when neighbouring Delhi is dealing with an unprecedented crisis, with hospitals approaching courts and pleading for replenishment of their oxygen stocks. A few Delhi hospitals on Thursday had to discharge their patients, as their oxygen stock ran out.At present, the district has 18,120 active cases of Covid-19, of whom 1,055 are currently hospitalised.Arora said that currently, the oxygen demand of Gurugram is almost 28-30 metric tonnes a day, which the state is trying to fulfil from oxygen plants in Panipat, Bhiwadi and Himachal Pradesh.“Panipat-based plant has a capacity to produce 240MT oxygen. As discussed in a meeting with the Central government on Thursday, over 140 MT has been allocated to Delhi, 80 MT to Haryana and 20MT to Punjab to ensure there is an uninterrupted supply of oxygen to hospitals. Haryana has also been getting 20MT of oxygen from Bhiwadi, Rajasthan and 20 MT from Himachal Pradesh. Overall, the Central government has allocated over 162 MT oxygen supply for Haryana,” he said.The oxygen plant in Bhiwadi was the main source of medical oxygen for Gurugram hospitals, as over 20 metric tonnes were supplied every day. The supply resumed on Thursday after the state government and district administration spoke with the Rajasthan government, said officials.Deputy commissioner Yash Garg said that the situation improved on Thursday as supply has been resumed from Bhiwadi and the situation should normalise by Thursday night. “If we get regular supply from Panipat and Bhiwadi, we will have enough for all of our hospitals,” he said.“We sent Fortis an oxygen tanker and 100 oxygen cylinders to ensure there is enough supply for the patients,” he added.Meanwhile, staff of smaller hospitals in the district are dependent on oxygen cylinders from a Manesar facility and said they have to queue up for hours to get their quota.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/hospitals-fall-short-of-oxygen-supply-from-bhiwadi-resumes-101619113010666.html
22-04-2021||Gurugram||Hospital beds for Covid-19 patients increased as cases shoot past 3,500||The district on Thursday reported 3,553 new Covid-19 cases, the first time the single-day spike has crossed 3,000, and 10 deaths, following which the district administration issued a slew of directions to increase the bed capacity for Covid-19 patients.“It has been decided to reserve more oxygen and ICU beds for Covid-19 patients in both private and government hospitals. Of the total, 60% of general beds and 75% of ICU beds will be reserved for Covid-19 patients,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, Gurugram.The district administration also appointed officials to ensure that seriously ill patients are given priority for hospitalisation, and directed private hospitals to record the number of patients admitted on the administration’s recommendation. Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar also conducted a review meeting to assess the emerging situation caused by the surge in cases of Covid-19 across the state.Increasing bed capacity is expected to alleviate the stress of home isolation for moderate to serious patients, many of whom took to the social media platforms to complain about the difficulty in getting hospital admissions and medicines for treatment.As per details shared by the health department, the highest single-day spike of cases on Thursday took the total to 92,419 cases and the active cases to 18,120, with 17,968 in home isolation. On Thursday, 1,450 patients recovered from Covid-19.Officials said that the number of daily cases hit a record high on consecutive days, with the district recording 2,988 cases on Wednesday. The fatality rate is currently at 0.4%.Yadav said that the health department will expand testing, vaccination and also focus more on isolating the micro-containment zones in the city. “We have also recommended that micro-containment zones should be increased in the city and directions in this regard have been issued by the authorities,” he said.“People should wear masks, avoid gatherings and those in isolation should monitor their vitals regularly to avoid complications,” said Yadav.On the testing front, the health department collected 12,067 samples and reported that the results of 7,679 patients were awaited.Meanwhile, in the review meeting held by the chief minister, Yash Garg, deputy commissioner, Gurugram stated that 40-50% of beds in general wards were reserved for Covid-19 patients. He also said that there was no shortage of oxygen in the district and an HCS (Haryana Civil Services) official has been deputed for allocation of oxygen for hospitals.Garg also said that the positivity rate of Covid-19 patients in the district stood at 22-23% and that 200 to 300 patients of the 2,500 to 3,000 cases every day require hospitalisation.The nodal officer will ensure proper allotment of beds to patients and hospitals have been asked to inform how many patients were admitted on the recommendations of district administration, an order issued by the deputy commissioner stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/hospital-beds-for-covid-19-patients-increased-as-cases-shoot-past-3500-101619112950658.html
22-04-2021||Other||Oxygen Express to reach Lucknow on Saturday||The Oxygen Express – the oxygen-loaded train— is expected to reach the state capital on Saturday, carrying around 60,000 litres of liquid medical oxygen (LMO). Officials with Northern Railways (NR) said, they are expecting more such trains in the near future that will mitigate the ‘oxygen crisis’ that has emerged following the sudden spike in demand of LMO. The initiative is part of the UP government’s move under which it had approached the Railways to help them out in bringing LMO from Jharkhand, Bengal and Odisha in order to meet the increased demand of LMO in state, especially in Lucknow, Varanasi and Faizabad. Sanjay Tripathi, divisional railway manager (DRM), NR Lucknow, who is tracking the train’s movement, said that the train is expected to leave Bokaro, Jharkhand, tomorrow. “Since it’s around 805km run from Bokaro to Lucknow, the train with an average speed of 63km per hour—that is double the speed of a truck—will take around 16 hours to cover. Hence, the train loaded with LMO is expected to reach Lucknow by Saturday,” said Tripathi. The Oxygen Express left Lucknow on Wednesday night and will reach Bokaro and get the oxygen chambers filled, on Thursday night. As soon as this process is completed, the train will commence its return journey, the DRM added. Initially, there were plans to send around seven empty oxygen chambers to Bokaro. However, despite several trials and following technical glitches, only three oxygen chambers could be sent. Officials said that roughly one chamber has a capacity of around 20,000 litres. “Currently, only three oxygen chambers could be sent. However, in later phases more such trains could be run to Bokaro and other plants to fetch oxygen,” he added. The entire exercise is being carried out under strict supervision of additional chief secretary (ACS) home, transport department and the food safety and drug administration.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/oxygen-express-to-reach-lucknow-on-saturday-101619111450672.html
22-04-2021||Other||As acute Oxygen shortage hits Lucknow, citizens travel to other cities in search||Due to the rising number of deaths of Covid-19 patients caused by oxygen shortage in the state capital, people have started arranging for cylinders from other places.People from Lucknow are travelling to Barabanki, Sitapur, Rae Bareli, Lakhimpur, Hardoi, Shahajahnpur, Bareilly, Moradabad and as far as Uttarakhand to get oxygen cylinders. The places continue to become farther everyday as authorities in Lucknow fail to make arrangements for oxygen.On Wednesday, Sukhdev Singh a resident of Alambagh drove over 300 kilometres to Moradabad to buy an oxygen cylinder for his elder brother suffering from complications caused by Covid-19. “I decided to go to Moradabad when I failed to arrange an oxygen cylinder in Lucknow. It is also very hard to get him admitted to a hospital and his oxygen level was going down,” Singh said.Like Singh, 22 other people from Lucknow bought oxygen cylinders from the same firm: Basant Gas Company in Moradabad in the last two days. Dileep Singh, owner of Basant Gases Company, said, “In the last three-four days, more than 20 people from Lucknow have purchased oxygen cylinders from us. We have received more than a 100 inquiries from Lucknow for the availability of oxygen cylinders. We have kept some stock for our local customers and have started to decline requests from other cities.”Similarly, in Bareilly, some 240 kilometres from the state capital, traders of oxygen cylinders are receiving desperate inquiries from people in Lucknow. “More than 80% of our sales in the last week have been made to people from Lucknow. Now, even our stocks have ended and we are declining orders of people from Lucknow,” said Mahendra Pal of Ashoka Gas Company in Bareilly.Gas traders in Bareilly have exhausted their stocks and have written to the district administration to make arrangements for the liquid with which they make oxygen, so that they can continue the supply of oxygen. “Earlier, we use to get the supply of the liquid twice every week. But now this liquid is being diverted to other cities. We have asked the authorities to restart our supply so that we can meet the demands of our customers,” said Rajendra Gupta, owner of Medical Gas Company in Bareilly.The stocks of gas traders in Barabanki, Lakhimpur, Sitapur, Hardoi, Rai Bareli have also been exhausted in the last few days due to the rise in demand from Lucknow.Not just oxygen, people from Lucknow are also travelling long distances to get Remdesivir. In Lucknow, the drug has vanished even from the black market where it was being sold at exorbitant rates. “I managed to get four vials of Remdesivir from Lalitpur district near Madhya Pradesh for my mother. The drug is not available anywhere in Lucknow,” said Somesh Kumar Rai, a resident of Telibagh area here.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/as-acute-oxygen-shortage-hits-lucknow-citizens-travel-to-other-cities-in-search-101619111330597.html

I understand some people might be facing problems due to the lockdown, but it has become necessary to break the chain of Covid-19. I will request people to not come out of their houses unless absolutely necessary and cooperate in the initiative, that I believe will help reduce the cases.”The spread of the virus can be assumed from the fact that the state recorded 53,065 cases in past three weeks (April 1 to 21), while 496 people lost their lives due the disease during the period. The state registered its highest 5,041 cases and 62 deaths on Wednesday this week.The situation was worse in capital city Ranchi which recorded 18,732 cases in just 21 days of the current month, while 137 people died due to the disease during the same period. Police were deployed at every strategic point in Ranchi on Thursday, while they tried to explain people about the importance of the week amid rising cases of coronavirus disease. Despite that, huge gathering of people was witnessed at the city’s Daily Market for purchase of vegetable and fruits. The police personnel deployed there urged people to stand at a distance in a bid to maintain Covid-19 protocol.Grocery, vegetable, fruit and liquor shops are exempted from the lockdown restrictions.Officer in-charge of Daily Market Police Station, Rajesh Kumar, said, “We tried to convince people on the very first day. If they do not follow Covid-19 protocol, we will take legal action.”Meanwhile, movement of vehicles was light on Thursday compared to normal days in Ranchi, even though transportation has not been restricted under the week-long lockdown.

In a letter to principal secretary (health) Pratay Amrit on Wednesday, BHSA said it had received information from members that “no government official is taking any cognisance of doctors having contracted the virus on duty or of medical professionals whose families had also got affected”. Altogether, 384 employees of AIIMS Patna, including doctors and nurses, have been infected during the second wave so far, its medical superintendent C M Singh told PTI. Patna Medical College and Hospital (PMCH) superintendent Dr Indu Sekhar Thakur said more than 125 of its employees had tested positive so far. He said the list includes 70 doctors and over 55 nurses and other health workers. BHSA has demanded that the state government immediately constitute a cell to extend all support to medical and health workers affected by Covid, set up dedicated Covid care facilities by converting hotels as hospitals exclusively for treatment and isolation of families of medical professionals and also provide a group insurance of ₹1 crore to all medical professionals. “This a pitiable state of affairs. We are front line workers helping patients to fight Covid. But when we and our families are contracting the virus and falling ill, there is nobody to look after us. A large number of doctors in the state have contracted the infection and subsequently transmitted it to their families.But they are fending for themselves,” said Dr Dipak Kumar Singh, senior vice-president of BHSA and its spokesperson. He said government should use funds to provide group insurance instead of giving one month extra salary to medical professionals as announced. “I and my teenaged son are Covid positive. My wife is also not well.There is nobody to even buy medicines or other home essentials for us as we are all in home isolation. My gardener is now my only help as my driver is also positive. Nobody from the hospital or civil surgeon’s office has even bothered to call us to extend help,” said a senior doctor and member of BHSA, posted at a government hospital in Patna. He did not want his name to be disclosed. Another government hospital doctor in Patna , preferring anonymity, narrated how he had been running fever for the last 10 days, besides suffering from throat irritation, anxiety and loss of taste due to the infection. “Nobody is caring for us. I am isolated in my room and now only concerned about my family,” he said.Some of the doctors shared how they had to get their RT-PCR tests done at private labs after developing symptoms as the queue in getting tests at government facilities was long. “RT-PCR test results are coming after four to five days and till that time, doctors are getting more exposed. That is a risky affair and raising complications,” said another doctor, demanding that testing for medical professionals be scaled up. Principal secretary (health) Prataya Amrit, reacting to the letter from BHSA, said all government hospitals had been instructed to keep dedicated beds for doctors and health care staff affected by Covid. On the demand for group insurance for medical professionals, he said the Bihar was the only state that had made provision to give additional one month’s salary to all medical professionals. “Besides, there is provision that family of those doctors dying due to Covid on duty would be entitled for full salary till retirement, apart from other benefits,” he said. Amrit said 95% of the doctors and medical care staff had received first dose of Covid vaccine while 74 doctors/ medical professionals had got the second dose.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/500-medicos-at-two-patna-hospitals-test-ve-association-write-to-govt-101619110130493.html

The NMCH chief also directed his doctors not to prescribe Remdesivir.There has been rampant black-marketing of the drug in several parts of the state, including capital Patna, as the ground report suggests. An official familiar with the matter, who didn’t wish to be identified, said pharma companies supply the prescription drug to distributor/stockists, who sell it to medical stores, which, in turn, sell it to middlemen or medical representatives who finally offer it to patients at exorbitant prices. A medical practitioner said the maximum retail price (MRP) per vial (100 mg) for various brands of Remdesivir manufactured by pharma companies are ₹5,400 for Hetero, ₹4,700 for Mylan, ₹4,700 for Jubliant, ₹5,400 for Dr Reddy’s, ₹4,000 for Cipla, ₹2,450 for Syngene’s and ₹899 for Zydus and Cadila. But touts are offering Remdesivir, purportedly manufactured by Zydus, for ₹25,000 a vial, almost 25 times its MRP. “My father is critically ill. Almost all medical stores in Patna are out of Remdesivir. I had no choice but to pay ₹1.06 lakh to a middleman for four bottles of Remdesivir,” a patient’s son said, requesting anonymity. “We needed the injection for my uncle who was being treated for Covid-19. If you do not have money to pay for Remdesivir being sold in the black market, you have no option but to give up on the life of your loved one,” said Rajkumar, a native of Maner. “The pandemic has affected people financially. The government should provide this drug free or cap the price at ₹500 to ₹1,000 per vial.

The hospital administration denied that the deaths happened due to lack of oxygen, but admitted they were unable to provide the required level of the medical gas.“No death happened due to lack of oxygen. Both the patients were being given oxygen from the concentrators we have for the patients and were under treatment for the past few days. Yes, we needed more oxygen for increasing the flow of the medical gas and, for that, our 12 jumbo cylinders are awaiting refill at the oxygen plant since yesterday, but the agency is not giving us the gas,” said Richa Mishra of the hospital.Lucknow reported a total 19 deaths and 5,239 fresh Covid-19 cases during the day.The situation in other Covid and non-Covid hospitals wasn’t comfortable either as attendants were regularly called to shift their patients elsewhere while new admissions were stopped at many hospitals for lack of adequate oxygen.“Oxygen crisis has restricted admissions as admitting more patients will require more oxygen. Hence, primarily we are trying to manage patients who are already admitted and getting oxygen from all the sources from where we can,” said Dr Salman Khalid of the Fehmina Hospital, Trauma Centre and Blood Bank.“Arrange beds in another hospital or arrange oxygen for your patient yourself” — such messages from hospitals troubled attendants for the second day on Thursday as private Covid and non-Covid hospitals hardly admitted any patients for want of oxygen.“The hospital called up, saying there is only oxygen back-up for two hours and if it is not refilled, the patient will have to be shifted. You may please arrange bed at other hospital. As soon as I got the call, I rang every friend and all my contacts to get the oxygen cylinders filled so that I could give it to the hospital but nowhere could I find the medical gas,” said an attendant who had a relative admitted to a hospital in Gomti Nagar.Two private Covid hospitals have already put up a notice for attendants, informing them about poor oxygen supply while serious patients in hospitals across the state capital continue to get oxygen at the threshold of the stock.“I have 12 beds for Covid-19 patients but at present I have admitted only four. This is because I am able to manage oxygen only for these many patients. An ambulance with empty oxygen cylinders is standing at filling station since morning,” said Nishant Singh of Make Well Hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/hospitals-continue-to-grapple-with-oxygen-crisis-in-lucknow-101619109350558.html
22-04-2021||Pune||After Nashik tragedy, hospitals begin audit of oxygen tanks in Pune||PUNE: A day after 24 Covid patients died as oxygen supply was disrupted due to leakage, the Pune Municipal Corporation started audit of medical oxygen supply systems installed at various hospitals in the city. HT in its Thursday edition has reported PMC instructing civic-run and private hospitals to inspect oxygen tanks and supply network and fix if there are any leakages. Additional Municipal Commissioner, PMC, Rubal Agrawal also issued the written circular on Thursday to all hospitals. The circular mentioned, “All the private hospitals need to carry out safety audits of the storage tanks and pipelines with the help of third parties. After doing the audit, the hospital authorities need to submit the written reply to the Municipal Corporation.” Following the order, Pune Mayor Murlidhar Mohol, Standing Committee chairman Hemant Rasne and Municipal Commissioner Vikram Kumar held a review meeting for oxygen supply and the safety of storage tanks. A team of PMC health department officials also visited Dr Naidu hospital to conduct audit of oxygen storage tank and supply system. Twenty-four Covid patients died of oxygen deprivation in Nashik as a fault in the tank’s valves caused the prescribed oxygen pressure to reduce, leading to oxygen deprivation. The hospital, a civic-run entity, was treating 157 Covid patients, of which 131 were on oxygen support and 15 were on ventilators. With sudden increase in the demand of oxygen, many hospitals in Pune have installed jumbo oxygen storage tanks and pipelines to connect it to ICU and from there to oxygen beds in the hospital. The city’s oxygen demand, according to PMC authorities, has went up to 300 metric tonnes per day. The Pune Municipal Corporation run hospitals require 42 metric tonne oxygen per day and rest is to other private hospitals. Pune city has around 190 small and big hospitals treating Covid patients with allocated bed capacity of 10,991. The entire district has 475 Covid hospitals with 27,542 allocated beds. After the Covid-19 surge, the local bodies like PMC and district administration have started erecting new Covid hospitals and the oxygen facilities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/after-nashik-tragedy-hospitals-begin-audit-of-oxygen-tanks-in-pune-101619108930371.html

The poll body put a ban on all rallies in the state due to a surge in number of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases."In the wake of upsurge in #COVID19 cases across the country and the ECI Order dated 22nd April, 2021, I am cancelling all my prescheduled meetings and we will reach out to the people virtually.

"...the Commission has noted with anguish that many political parties/candidates are still not adhering to the prescribed safety norms during the public gatherings and this is making it difficult for the State/District election machineries to enforce the aforesaid directions fully;...," the ECI noted in its order.Almost a week ago, on April 16, the ECI had issued new orders increasing the silence period for campaigning in the state to 72 hours from the 48 hours existing then. The commission also prohibited any campaigning between 7pm and 10am on all campaign days due to increasing Covid-19 cases."In view of unprecedented public health situation and the imperative of ongoing elections, the commission today (Friday) extended the silence period up to 72 hours (instead of 48 hours) and restricted the period of campaign up to 7pm (instead of 10pm). These orders have come into effect immediately," the commission's April 16 order said.Further, it also directed the organisers of rallies and campaigns to provide facemasks and hand sanitisers to the attendees of such rallies and also asked them to ensure the proper usage of these measures.Watch | Vaccine pricing row: Mamata Banerjee & Sonia Gandhi lash out at PM ModiAmidst the rising number of Covid-19 cases in the country, campaigning for the assembly elections became a key point of contention between the political parties in the fray.Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, who is currently under isolation after testing positive on April 20, announced on April 18 that he is suspending all his political rallies in the state following the rise in number of cases.

22-04-2021||Pune||O2 production restriction, migrant workers returning homes impact small industries in Pune||Pune: The restrictions on industrial use of oxygen and lockdown norms seeing a rise in migrant workers returning home have badly hit the industries in Pune district. Though fewer migrants are leaving the district as compared to last year, small industries admit that their businesses have suffered after the implementation of fresh restrictions. “There are 5,000-6,000 small and big industries in the Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation area employing over two lakh migrant workers. Around 25-30% labourers have returned to their hometowns anticipating a full-lockdown like last year. Small scale industries are facing shortage of skilled labour. Operators and staff in many industries have been infected by Covid-19. So, production units are facing losses,” said Abhay Bhor, president, Forum of Small Scale Industries Association, Maharashtra. The government’s directive to reserve 100% oxygen production for medical use because of the deteriorating Covid situation has impacted the ancillary units in auto sector that depend on industrial oxygen. According to Dilip Batwal, secretary of Federation of Chakan industry, in the automobile sector, maximum parts are made through welding where oxygen is necessary. “So, there is an impact on these industries in the absence of oxygen supply,” said Batwal. On migrants returning to hometowns, Batwal said that 20-25% workers have returned and even workload has reduced. “There is no acute scarcity of labour, but it may arise in future. We are trying to convince them to stay,” said Batwal. The labour commissionerate, however, countered the claim saying that reverse migration of workers during this time of the year is a routine process. He said that the daily work of automobile industry is affected by lack of oxygen supply. “Since the past six days, we have started a ‘Help Centre’ at Pune railway station and review workers who are returning to homes. We have observed that in some cases the return journey was pre-planned due to personal works such as family functions. It is a routine development that the workers from UP and Bihar go back in this season and resume work after Dussehra,” an official said. While the state government has imposed restrictions in Maharashtra, industrial units have been exempted from these curbs. Mahratta Chamber of Commerce Industries and Agriculture (MCCIA) director-general Prashant Girbane said on the possible economic impact, “There could be a reduction up to 1.5% in Maharashtra GSDP (FY 21-22) as against what was presented in Budget 2021. While the aggregate numbers help a great deal, they also conceal - for example the disproportionate impact on informal workforce and those in contact based services.” Not only industrialists but those in related services are concerned about the reverse migration of workers. “In the current situation, there is extreme fear of unemployment and health risk among the workers. They have started migrating to their towns and it’s impacting the production process. If the scenario remains the same, it will lead to a massive shortage of manpower in industry,” said Shankar Salunkhe, founder-president, Vibrant HR Professionals Association, Pune.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/o2-production-restriction-migrant-workers-returning-homes-impact-small-industries-in-pune-101619104970146.html

This year, till April 20, 22 persons died on the tracks, even amid Covid restrictions. On April 18, a 57-year-old Army officer of the rank of Brigadier, posted at the Armed Forces Medical College (AFMC) in Pune, succumbed to injuries from being crushed under a moving train at the Pune railway station. The police during a preliminary probe suspect it to be death by suicide. As per the statistics shared by the railway police, “A total of 207 people died in 2018; 194 in 2019; 124 in 2020; and 22 in 2021 (till April 20). Before lockdown, 250 trains used to ply in the Pune railway division daily. However, from March 25, 2020, till May 2020, railway traffic was closed. Since June 1, 2020, trains started plying again and now about 100 trains are running daily.” Mishaps have occurred on railway tracks between Pune and Lonavala; Hadapsar and Baramati; and in Pune. According to senior police inspector Suresh Singh Gaud, the jurisdiction of Pune railway police extends from Lonavla station to Daund station Section 144 of the Railways act states that trespassing on the railway tracks is a punishable offence with imprisonment upto six months, and, or fine upto ₹1000. Last year while Railways was busy trying to prevent migrant labourers from walking on the tracks in the wake of the Aurangabad incident, 124 died on tracks under Pune railway police jurisdiction.

These include restrictions on inter-city and inter-district travel, office attendance and marriages.Issuing an order, the government said inter-city and inter-district travel is only permitted for essential services, medical emergencies and funerals. Only 25 people are allowed to attend marriages and the function cannot extend beyond two hours.Offices run by central, states and local governments can function with 15 per cent attendance but those providing emergency services for Covid-19 management are exempted. All other government and private offices have to function with 15 per cent attendance or five people- whichever is more, the order said.As Maharashtra is suffering from an acute shortage of oxygen supplies, hospital beds and essential drugs such as Remdesivir, the Bombay High Court on Thursday directed the Centre and the state government to file their replies by May 4 on the management of all these resources to fight the pandemic.A bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice GS Kulkarni told the Maharashtra government that not a single person should be denied a Covid-19 test on account of the lack of a valid doctor’s prescription for the same, according to news agency PTI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maha-sees-67-013-new-covid-cases-mumbai-s-daily-tally-continues-downward-trend-101619102871448.html

The FIR was registered at Bhadrakali police station under Section 304 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder) of the Indian Penal Code over allegations of gross negligence following oxygen supply disruption that led to the deaths at the civic-run Zakir Hussain hospital, said police commissioner Deepak Pandey. “We have lodged an FIR for negligence against unidentified persons and probe is on,” said Pandey. The leak in Nashik incident was on account of a fault in the tank’s valves that caused the prescribed oxygen pressure to reduce, leading to oxygen deprivation. The hospital was treating 157 Covid patients, of which 131 were on oxygen support and 15 on ventilators. “We have been able to restore the oxygen supply at the hospital,” said Nashik district collector Suraj Mandhare. He met a delegation of private doctors and members affiliated to Indian Medical Association, Nashik, to discuss the acute shortage of supply of oxygen to private hospitals. Earlier on Wednesday evening, Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope after visiting the hospital in Nashik, said, a seven-member high-powered committee will probe the incident. “Nashik divisional commissioner Radhakrishna Game will chair the committee which will have deputy director from state health department Dr PN Gandal, city-based intensivist Pramod Gunjal, professor Dyandev Nathe, Nashik municipal corporation additional engineer Sandeep Nalawade, FDA joint director Madhuri Pawar and Harshal Patil, an expert involved in installing oxygen plants,” said Tope.

Now, it is stated that only two hours will be given for rituals. It is not possible to conduct an entire wedding in two hours. The government should rethink this decision,” said Kshirsagar. As per the latest Covid norms declared on Wednesday by the state government, the wedding must end in two hours.Manmeet Kaur’s daughter’s wedding is scheduled for next week. “We have invited only 20 persons from both the families and the wedding is going to happen in a private hall near our house in Kondhwa. It was to be a day-long event where all the safety precautions were to be taken. Limiting the time to two hours is not correct, as weddings cannot happen in a couple of hours.”Meanwhile, a new trend of inviting guests online is emerging. Families send a YouTube link on social media to their friends and relatives, and on the day of the wedding the link is activated and people can attend the wedding ceremony virtually.

22-04-2021||Lucknow||'Governance failure in UP': Congress' Priyanka Gandhi slams state government's response to Covid-19 second wave||Alleging a governance failure in Uttar Pradesh in the face of the Covid-19 second wave, Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra has said the Yogi Adityanath dispensation long ceased to act as a protector and support system for the people in the state and has increasingly assumed the role of an "aggressor".In an interview with PTI, the Congress general secretary in-charge for Uttar Pradesh also said the handling of the Covid-19 pandemic was simply another reflection of the UP government's "arrogant, autocratic and inhuman attitude" towards the people of the state.Her remarks came amid a steep rise in coronavirus cases in the state. The Uttar Pradesh government on Thursday reported a record single-day spike of 34,379 Covid-19 cases and 195 fatalities. This has pushed Uttar Pradesh's infection tally to 9,76,765 and the death toll to 10,541.Asked about the grim Covid-19 situation in the state, the Congress leader said the fundamental issue is that the government in UP has long ceased to act as a protector, facilitator and support system for the public."It (the state government) has increasingly assumed the role of an aggressor. The handling of the Covid pandemic is simply another reflection of its arrogant, autocratic and inhuman attitude towards the people of UP," she said.The biggest failure has been in governance as there has been no planning, no preparation and no foresight whatsoever, the Congress leader alleged."Countries all over the world faced a second wave -- what did we learn from them? How did we use the gap between the first and second wave to prepare UP for what was inevitably going to come?" she asked.The UP government's own serosurvey results showed 5 crore people were exposed to the virus which was indicative of a second wave coming, she said."The government was advised to exponentially ramp-up testing. What happened? They reduced overall testing, switched to up to 70 per cent antigen testing and ignored their own serosurvey reports," she said, hitting out at the state government.Rather than putting every single resource into saving lives and combatting the pandemic, the UP government is still wasting time and resources on "covering up" the truth, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra alleged."The government has let people down. Their incompetence and lack of clarity is exacting an unprecedented human cost that no one should ever have had to pay," she said.On the alleged lack of preparation to deal with the second wave, she said, "How else can the Chief Minister and his government explain that despite having months of time between one wave and the other, no effort was made to increase UP's capacity for hospital beds, for oxygen or for the availability of Covid medication.""How else can they justify the number of hurdles they have placed before the public as it suffers through the horrors of the pandemic?" she asked.She also asked where else in the world does one need approval from the district medical officer or the district magistrate to get admission to a hospital in the middle of a devastating pandemic."It is unheard of. How can the government justify that only 30 per cent of the testing being done in UP is RT-PCR and 70 per cent is antigen testing? Reports from across the state are coming in that private labs are being verbally instructed not to test. What kind of governance is this?" she said.The UP government has been rejecting criticism by opposition parties on its handling of the Covid-19 situation.The Congress leader had earlier accused the Uttar Pradesh government of hiding coronavirus figures and said had they been cautious from day one, people would not have witnessed such times.Earlier this week, she had slammed the "red-tapism" in Uttar Pradesh, alleging that lives were lost because Covid-19 patients needed permission from the district chief medical officers to get admission in hospitals.In a letter to the Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister, the Congress general secretary had urged the creation of a database of available hospitals and beds so that people can seek admission directly.She had also flagged the issue of oxygen availability, saying she had been told that people need permission from the district magistrate for the hospital admission. She had called for the removal of all such rules causing difficulties for families of patients.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/governance-failure-in-up-congress-priyanka-gandhi-slams-state-government-s-response-to-covid-19-second-wave-101619098584106.html

Visitors are not allowed and donations have dropped.“Not only donations, but weekend visitors - relatives or school/college students – are not allowed to visit. Senior citizens used to enjoy the presence of students as they used to celebrate birthdays - playing games and sharing fruits and cakes. All activities have stopped now,” says Ramesh Devkule, manager of the Matoshree home in Karve nagar.Even though most of the homes are run by trusts, donations play a big role in the upkeep.“Earlier, people used to come forward and donate. Now due to a financial crunch, they have stopped. And we cannot ask because of the Covid crisis,” said Devkule.Fewer visitors have left the senior citizens restless.“But for a few months, this year we have not played any games with students. With colleges and schools shut, many are not visiting the homes,” says an inmate at Matoshree, requesting anonymity.“We have a capacity of 100 people, but now we only have 74 inmates. Management has restricted new entries currently. We make sure all 74 live a healthy and safe life,” said Devkule.Video chat for relativesManagement does organise video chat sessions for relatives.“We have strictly moved to video meetings. Earlier, it was hard for senior citizens, but now they are getting used to technology. Still, most enjoy physical meetings and we will resume once the situation becomes normal,” said Ravindra Marathe, trustee of Niwara home in Sadashiv peth.Vaccination drivesThe homes have made sure that all the seniors get their vaccinations, since most are above the age of 60.“Currently, we have only 15 senior citizens and all have got their vaccination done. We had informed their relatives and completed the procedure. None of the seniors have faced any health problem due to Covid-19 as of now,” said Arvind Maklur, manager of Anand Dham on Apte road.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/seniors-at-retirement-homes-have-lonely-new-routine-due-to-covid-crisis-101619098489818.html

22-04-2021||Mumbai||Bombay HC raps authorities for apathy in tackling shortage of oxygen, medicines||The Bombay high court’s Nagpur bench pulled up the authorities for reducing the oxygen supply to Nagpur to 60 metric tonnes and directed restoration of 110 metric tonnes immediately as it held a rare hearing across three sessions that lasted till around 11.00pm on Wednesday. It pulled up the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and pharmaceutical companies for failing to rise to the occasion to help Covid-19 patients as it directed raids against hoarders, black-marketers and supply of at least 100 antiviral remdesivir vials to the government-run Medical College and Hospital in Nagpur.The court hit out at the “callous and negligent conduct” of the authorities in complying with its directions to supply remdesivir to Nagpur. It refused to adjourn the hearing unless its April 19 order directing the supply of 10,000 vials of remdesivir injection was complied with.A division bench of justices Sunil Shukre and S M Modak expressed displeasure over affidavits of FDA and district administration “virtually washing their hands” and “passing the buck” to pharmaceutical companies. It found the affidavits to be contradictory. “You are violating fundamental rights of the people,” the bench said and asked whose business was it to procure remdesivir.Also Read | Support Maharashtra instead of doing politics: Congress to Devendra FadnavisThe court blamed the authorities for shirking responsibilities and lamented the plight of Covid-19 patients in the state. “If you do not feel ashamed of yourself, then we feel ashamed of being a part of this nasty and evil society. We cannot do anything for the unfortunate patients of Maharashtra. This is how we are shirking our responsibilities. You are neglecting and ignoring our patients. We give you [a] solution, you don’t follow it. You do not give us [a] solution. What absolute nonsense is going on here?” Lawyer MG Bhangde, who appeared for the state, told the court about the difficulties in compiling information and collating the facts.The court directed the Drug Controller of India to remain present virtually or personally on Friday in the court at 2.30 pm and directed him to explain steps taken to ensure equitable and fair distribution of remdesivir in Maharashtra and other states. The court pointed out that the drug controller had powers under Drug Control Act and several other statutes to direct pharmaceutical companies to increase production, ensure proper supply, and also take stringent action in case of non-supply or deliberate undersupply. The court noted that Maharashtra accounted for 40% of Covid-19 patients and added that the Union health ministry instead of increasing its oxygen quota reduced it. It held the second hearing in the matter in the high court auditorium and directed an immediate meeting of Nagpur’s Covid-19 Task Committee and also distributors, and stockists of life-saving drugs. The court also sought action against black marketers. Within two hours, divisional commissioner Sanjeev Kumar, district collector Ravindra Thakare and the municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B obtained assurances from the seven drug manufacturing companies about the supply of 6,752 additional vials of remdesivir by Thursday evening.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-raps-authorities-for-apathy-in-tackling-shortage-of-oxygen-medicines-101619092430104.html

The initial investigations show that the black marketing chain unearthed in Jaipur could extend to Gurugram in Haryana, said police.Police claim the accused were caught selling the drug at 15 times higher the original price. The drug has been in short supply in several states amid an alarming rise in Covid-19 cases. Its supply is currently regulated and the Rajasthan government barred chemists from selling it directly earlier this week. Several people have been booked in the past few days across the country for either hoarding or selling the medicine in the black.“The second wave of Covid is at (its) peak and so is the demand for Remdesivir injection.

Its medical superintendent Rajendra Mokta confirmed adequate stock of medicines. The rush is more at IGMC because it is a tertiary hospital where Covid cases from districts such as Kullu, Bilaspur and Kinnaur are being referred besides the influx from Shimla district.

Most patients prefer home isolation Himachal Pradesh has total capacity of 2,302 beds and so far, 35% of the beds are occupied across the state. A total of 802 beds are occupied. A majority of the patients suffering from Covid-19 prefer home isolation. Takes 48 hours to get test reports Due to the rush, people in Shimla have to wait for nearly 48 hours to get their Covid test reports. Shimla has only one laboratory at IGMC to check for Covid, while the other nearby facility is the Central Research Institute in Kasauli, which caters to samples collected in Solan and Sirmour districts. Kangra, Solan and Shimla face the brunt As on April 21, there were 10,793 active cases in the state. Kangra had the maximum of 2,382 active cases followed by 2,103 in Solan and 1,179 in Shimla.

"Such bias is not good," Patole said."Fadnavis should become the voice of Marathi people in Delhi. If Fadnavis and other BJP leaders can show haste in getting a Remdesivir black-marketeer released from police station, they should show similar urgencyin saving people's lives," the Congress leader said.Remdesivir is listed for use in serious Covid-19 patients. In view of a sudden spike in demand of the drug due to the surge in Covid-19 cases, the Centre last week banned its export till the situation improves.The Mumbai police on Saturday questioned an executive of a pharmaceutical company following information that a large number of Remdesivir vials were going to be flown abroad by air cargo, despite a ban on the export of the drug.On learning that the pharma firm official was being quizzed, Fadnavis and another state BJP leader Pravin Darekar had rushed to the police station on Saturday night."Amid the pandemic, the Centre was exporting Remdesivir and oxygen to other countries. Instead of paying attention to constructive suggestions of Congress leaders, the BJP mocked them," Patole alleged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/support-maharashtra-instead-of-doing-politics-congress-to-devendra-fadnavis-101619086719885.html
22-04-2021||Chandigarh||Sukhbir threatens protest over delayed payment to farmers||Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Singh Badal on Thursday threatened to launch an agitation if the Punjab government does not streamline the wheat procurement system by the weekend. Badal, who visited grain markets at Goniana and Maulka, said farmers are being harassed due to delayed purchase. Lamenting the Punjab government’s failure to contain the Covid-19 pandemic, he demanded an investigation into the claim that the state has spent ₹1,000 crore to strengthen health infrastructure to fight the spread of the infection. In view of the pandemic, the state government has banned all social and political gatherings. Gatherings of more than 20 people, including weddings and cremations, have also been banned across the state. However, Sukhbir visited the two purchase centres with a large group of his party workers and public relations team. As he was blaming the state for the rising number of Covid-19 cases, several of his team members at Goniana and Maluka were seen violating Covid-appropriate behaviour. On Wednesday, the district police arrested eight people after registering an FIR for hosting a celebratory function in which more than 20 people were present at the Civil Lines Club. Sukhbir himself did not adhere to social distancing and several among his team were without masks. No appeal was made to farmers, mediapersons or his SAD activists to follow the guidelines. He said farmers have been waiting at the mandi for over 12 days and the agencies have not bought grains. “More than 40% of farmers await payment and chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh has not intervened. In the interest of farmers, the SAD will wait for the government’s action to redress farmers’ problems in the next three days,” he said. Deputy commissioner B Srinivasan said he would seek a detailed report from the district mandi officer. “Social distancing should be followed as this is a crucial time of medical emergency,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sukhbir-threatens-protest-over-delayed-payment-to-farmers-101619086130065.html

The fresh one to approach the high court is Saroj Super Specialty in Rohini.The bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Rekha Palli heard a fresh matter by Saroj after a plea from Max Healthcare on Wednesday. It once again asked the Centre what steps have been taken to ensure proper oxygen supply to hospitals.Also Watch: ‘Not a comfortable situation’, Delhi minister Satyendar Jain on oxygen crisisThe Delhi govt told the court that oxygen plants in Durgapur, Rourkela and Kalinganagar (in Odisha) have been asked to deliver oxygen to hospitals in Delhi. "The intention is there, but the plants are at far off places making it difficult for them to bring oxygen. It will take two days," said senior advocate Rahul Mehra, appearing for the Delhi government.The judges then suggested getting the oxygen from nearby plants, saying the some states are not letting the supply of the allocated amount of oxygen. "That is something you have to handle," said the court."What is the use of allocation if it is not going and reaching from where it is required?" said the judges.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, who represented the Centre, assured that the requirement for oxygen will be met, and said this is not the time for A government versus B government.The high court directed the Centre to ensure strict compliance of the allocation order issued by the Union home ministry on Thursday, and its own order on April 21."We also direct all the authorities to ensure the strict compliance of the order. We want to make it clear that this order is implemented immediately and action would be taken against the non-compliance," said the bench."We direct that all the oxygen as per the allocating order, to ensure that adequate security is provided to the lorries transporting oxygen and there is no obstruction is created. Special corridor may be created," it further said.The high court's direction came after a home ministry official joined the hearing. The official informed the court that the MHA is continuously in touch with nodal officer of Delhi for smooth supply of oxygen to hospitals.The home ministry on Thursday sent an order to all the states saying that there shall be no restriction on the movement of medical oxygen and stressed that the supply cannot be limited to any particular state.Meanwhile, the Saroj Hospital received oxygen supply after running on backup cylinders for 4.5 hours. The hospital had to discharge patients and stop new admissions.In its petition, the hospital sought direction to the Centre, Delhi government and Inox, which supplies oxygen to hospitals in Delhi, to immediately supply 3000 cubic metres of oxygen and continue the same on a daily basis during the current Covid-19 wave.While haring Max's plea on Wednesday, the high court directed the Centre to beg, borrow or steal or do whatever to supply medical oxygen to hospitals for treatment of Covid-19 patients.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/not-a-time-for-a-vs-b-centre-says-in-hc-on-oxygen-supply-101619085131599.html

22-04-2021||Delhi||'Will be tough to save lives after some time': Delhi deputy CM Manish Sisodia's SOS over oxygen supply||The issue of oxygen shortage is serious in Delhi and it will be tough to save lives after some time, Delhi’s deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia said on Thursday. He also said that some hospitals in Delhi have run out of oxygen completely.“We’ve been making internal arrangements for now, but it will become tough to save lives after some time,” Sisodia said at a press conference and added he has been receiving emails and messages regarding the shortage.“Some Delhi hospitals have run out of oxygen completely. They have no options left,” he added.The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader also accused the neighbouring states of Haryana and Uttar Pradesh of blocking Delhi’s oxygen supply.“Major reason behind Delhi’s oxygen crisis is ‘jungle raj’ for oxygen by Haryana-UP. Their governments, officers and police aren’t letting supply from their oxygen plants come to Delhi. Our officers spoke to them, I tried to speak to GoI but things aren’t changing on ground,” Sisodia said.Speaking about the Centre’s decision on Wednesday to increase the supply of oxygen in Delhi and some other states, Sisodia questioned why neighbouring Haryana and Uttar Pradesh were behaving as if they had some dispute with Delhi and added all have to be united against the pandemic.He also urged the Centre to take the assistance of paramilitary forces if required and ensure the supply of oxygen - critical for serious Covid-19 patients - to Delhi.Delhi and Haryana have been engaged in squabble over the oxygen crisis. The Delhi government has accused the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government in Haryana of stopping supplies into the national capital.However, the Haryana government termed this allegation as baseless and said the supply was interrupted due to technical reasons. “No supply has been stopped to Delhi. This is not true,” state health minister Anil Vij told news agency PTI on Wednesday and claimed that one of the oxygen tankers going to Delhi from Faridabad was looted by the Delhi government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/will-be-tough-to-save-lives-after-some-time-sisodia-s-sos-over-oxygen-supply-101619083412378.html

22-04-2021||Patna||Bihar relying on MGNREGS to employ migrants returning from big cities||Bihar government has directed that all migrant workers returning to the state amid the second wave of Covid-19 infections are given job passes and work under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) among other central schemes, said officials.C P Khanduja, director and commissioner, MGNREGA, said the rural development department has already received approval for creating 20 crore man-days of work under the scheme for the new fiscal year and plan to raise it to 30 crore man-days anticipating higher work demand due to the influx of migrants. Respective district magistrates (DMs) have been given the responsibility to gainfully employ the returnees, said the official.MGNREGA guarantees a minimum 100 days of unskilled work to rural households at wages fixed by the Centre. The central scheme was extensively used last year to provide temporary jobs to many of the roughly 2.5 million migrants who returned home during the Covid-induced lockdown last year. Bihar, home to one of the largest migrant workforce, is again relying on the scheme to engage migrants returning from industrialised states such as Delhi, Maharashtra and Haryana during the ongoing second wave of the virus.Khanduja said funds were not a problem now since the Central government was expected to release ₹1,000 crore as wage instalment for 5 crore man-days in the first quarter. A MGNREGA man-day refers to a day of work provided to a beneficiary under the scheme.In generating man-days, Bihar was much behind fellow states like Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal and Rajasthan with huge migrant populations.In the last fiscal Bihar created 22 crore man-days; whereas UP created 39 crore, Bengal 41 crore and Rajasthan 45 crore.“We performed as per our target,” Khanduja said, adding there were issues regarding delayed fund flows from the Centre in January and February this year. “The state’s government initially targeted 18 crore man-days in the last fiscal, which was revised to 20 crore man-days. In February, it was revised to 22 crore,” he said.Khanduja said Bihar created 7 crore man-days in May and June last year, which was a record of sorts. “It shows there was high job creation when migrants were returning home after the Covid-19 lockdown was imposed,” he said.The opposition however pointed out that a very few migrant workers got 100 man-days of work under the scheme even last year. State Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) president and former minister Jagdanand Singh said the scheme failed to meet the job demand of the migrants due to “flawed implementation” and alleged “discrepancies” at the block and panchayat levels.“...The government is not able to provide 100 days of work to even 10% of job card holders as against the number of those registered because there are a lot of gaps in the system of work demand by labourers. There is no transparency,” he said.The MGNREGA commissioner said low wages under the scheme in comparison to the wages offered by the state government was a big reason for lesser job demand. As against ₹198 per man-day under the scheme, unskilled labourers were paid ₹304/day by the state, as per the revision effective from April 1, 2021.Singh doesn’t agree fully, he says a lot needs to be fixed in the implementation of the scheme before raising the wage question.“Government should first tell whether the panchayat bhawans maintain registers detailing how many people sought jobs? ... Besides, why does the government not publicise the projects to be undertaken at the local level to attract workers? Has the state taken up the issue of low wage rate under MGNREGS with the Central government despite Bihar’s rate being much lower than many other states?,” Singh questioned.Education minister Vijay Kumar Chaudhary, when asked about the state’s lower rating in terms of man-days, said, “There has been a quantum jump in job card holders and work has been given as per demand.”Professor Nawal Kishore Choudhary, noted economist and former principal of Patna College, said the man-days generated by Bihar last fiscal shows the government has lagged behind in giving jobs under the MGNREGS.“Bihar is largely a migrant state and creating only 22 crore man-days of work was a poor show in the face of huge inflow of migrants,” he said. He also pointed out that dependence on MGNREGS is flawed since the job guarantee scheme was meant for unskilled workers, whereas many returning migrants were skilled and semi-skilled workers.‘Government had carried a skill mapping but no white paper was issued on how many jobs have been created and employment provided to semi-skilled and skilled workers in the last one year. The migrant problem is persisting because semi-skilled and skilled workers are not getting matching jobs and the MGNREGS is unable to fully absorb the unskilled workers,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-relying-on-mgnregs-to-employ-migrants-returning-from-big-cities-101619080189775.html

Every Indian needs free vaccine, regardless of age, caste, creed, location. GoI must fix ONE price for Covid vaccine irrespective of who pays— Centre or the States,” Banerjee tweeted on Thursday.Serum Institute of India (SII) on Wednesday announced it will sell its anti-Coronavirus disease (Covid-19) vaccine, Covishield, for ₹400 to state governments, and ₹600 to private hospitals in the country.Also watch | Vaccine pricing row: Mamata Banerjee & Sonia Gandhi lash out at PM Modi﻿﻿The firm made the announcement after the Centre on Monday allowed Covid-19 vaccine makers to sell their vaccine in the open market in India at a pre-decided rate.Also Read | ‘Not a different price’: What Adar Poonawalla says on Covishield price rowWhile addressing mediapersons on Wednesday, Banerjee had said that she would write to the Prime Minister over the differentiation in pricing of vaccines and urged the Centre to intervene.“Vaccines, which were sold to the Centre for ₹150, will now be sold to states for ₹400 and to private hospitals for ₹600.

Kejriwal appealed to the Centre for more oxygen, pointing out that Delhi does not produce oxygen on its own and hence has to depend on other states for supply.Also Read: Delhi may transport oxygen via air to save time: CM KejriwalWith several private and government hospitals in Delhi running low on medical oxygen for Covid-19 patients, the Centre on Wednesday had raised the national capital's oxygen quota from 378 metric tonnes to 480 metric tonnes.

We need more but we're thankful to them for this," news agency ANI quoted Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal as saying.The Delhi chief minister further said that in addition to fixing the oxygen quota for several states, the central government also allots companies that will supply oxygen to a particular state. "Delhi doesn't produce oxygen, supply here is done by other states. Some of the governments, in whose states these companies are, had stopped the supply that was to come to Delhi from these companies," he said.Kejriwal's statements come a day after Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia alleged that an official of the Haryana government had stopped oxygen supply to Delhi from a plant in Faridabad. A similar incident took place in Uttar Pradesh on Tuesday. This led to a crisis in some hospitals, Sisodia had said, adding the oxygen supply was later restored.Also Read: Covid-19: Urge Centre to increase quota of oxygen in Delhi, says Manish Sisodia as Capital continues to see shortageSpeaking in a similar vein, Delhi CM Kejriwal on this day said, "Governments said that they'll use the oxygen in their states first, use Delhi's quota too and that they'll not let trucks come to Delhi. But I would like to thank the Centre and the Delhi high court for their help. Due to this, oxygen has once again started reaching Delhi." He said that under the increased quota, oxygen is scheduled to come to Delhi from Odisha as well, albeit with some delay.

When asked by reporters about the situation of oxygen in hospitals, Jain said, "The situation is different in different hospitals. It's six hours in some, eight in others, and 10 in some others. We cannot call this a comfortable situation."Situation is different in different hospitals; 6 hours in some, 8 in others 10 in some others. We can't call this a comfortable situation: Delhi Health Minister Satyendar Jain when asked about situation of Oxygen in Delhi hospitals & how long will Oxygen last in each of them pic.twitter.com/T85WWL8gDIAmid a shortage of medical oxygen in the national capital, the Delhi health minister pointed out that there is a crisis in ICU beds as well. "There is a crisis of ICU beds. We have made a request to the Centre; I think they will give us 700-800 more ICU beds soon. We have demanded 7,000 beds in the central government-run hospitals, they have given us around 2,000," said Jain.He said that Delhi's oxygen quota was "less than requirement", following which the Centre increased it on Wednesday. If the crisis is resolved in a day or two, the number of beds will be increased, the minister said.The Delhi high court had on Wednesday night ordered the Centre to "forthwith" provide oxygen by whatever means to hospitals here facing a shortage of the gas in treating serious Covid-19 patients, observing it “seems human life is not important for the state”.Several small hospitals in the city were seen on Thursday morning struggling to replenish oxygen supply, even as some big healthcare facilities received fresh stock overnight amid spiralling Covid-19 cases. However, several private hospitals complained that no help has reached them.Delhi logged 24,638 coronavirus cases and 249 deaths on Wednesday, as the positivity rate stood at 31.28% -- meaning almost every third sample turned out to be positive -- amid a growing clamour for oxygen and hospital beds in the city. Only 18 ICU beds for Covid-19 patients were available in hospitals across Delhi at 11 pm, according to a government data.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/situation-with-medical-oxygen-in-delhi-not-comfortable-satyendar-jain-warns-101619071928023.html

22-04-2021||Ranchi||Ranchi hospitals get a lion’s share of Remdesivir stock||While people and hospitals across the state have been demanding Remdesivir injections for Covid-19 patients, the bulk of it was reportedly being alloted to private hospitals and nursing homes in Ranchi alone, according to the state government’s allotment lists, raising the question as to how other patients would get the much-needed drug from.As per the allotment lists of Tuesday and Monday this week, about 90% Remdesivir injection vials were sent to private hospitals and nursing homes based in Ranchi out of the total 330 vials of Cipla and 528 vials of Mylan on Monday, and 790 vials of Mylan on Tuesday.Ranchi-based private hospitals and nursing homes were alloted almost 698 vials out of the total 790 vials available on Tuesday.Understandably, big Ranchi-based hospitals such as Medica was alloted 80 vials and 65 vials of Remdesivir injection vials on Monday and Tuesday, respectively. Similarly, Samford Hospital got a total of 110 vials on Monday and Tuesday, Guru Nanak Hospital got 60 vials and Raj Hospital got 80 vials.Similarly, Medanta Abdur Razzak Ansari Hospital got 30, Pulse Super Speciality Hospital got 75, Maa Ram Pyari SS Hospital got 32 and Health Point got 20 vials of Mylan brand Remdesivir on Tuesday among the highest allottees from Ranchi. According to available information, the consignment was expected to be delivered on Wednesday.Meanwhile, Adventist got 24 vials, Lake View got 26 and Jaslok got 30 vials on Monday.Interestingly, Tata Main Hospital (TMH) - the biggest Covid-19 hospital in the state with 565 beds treating as many patients - was allotted only 75 vials of Mylan on Tuesday. TMH has 36 CCU beds and 22 ventilator beds.It has witnessed 64 deaths during past six days.“There is serious shortage of Remdesivir injections at TMH but we are managing somehow with Peramivir injections. We have, however, put in our requisition for Remdesivir injections with the state government authorities but has not received those yet,” Dr Rajan Chowdhury, Tata Steel medical advisor, said on Wednesday.Dr Nirmal Drolia from Patliputra Nursing Home in Dhanbad said they only got two Remdesivir vials against requisition of 150 and was allotted 12 vials against requisition of 300 injections on Tuesday.“We have not received the consignment yet. May be high demand and short of supply is the reason. But, we need to administer six vials per patient to complete the course of treatment, that is being defeated by such paltry allotment,” said Dr Drolia, adding that 39 Covid-19 patients were under treatment at the hospital presently.Dr Rakshit Kumar from 111 Save Life Hospital in Adityapur said they have been allotted four vials against requisition of at least 12.Asian Jalan Super Speciality Hospital with 27 Covid-19 patients in Dhanbad was allotted four vials against requisition of 40-50. Tata Motors Hospital was allotted 10 vials on Tuesday.Hazaribagh Arogyam Hospital was allotted 28 vials, Hazaribagh Life Care 14 and Ajay Sudha Clinic in Deogarh was allotted 12 vials of Cipla on Monday. Uma Super Speciality Hospital on NH-33 in Jamshedpur was alotted four vials on Tuesday.Remdesivir injection is not allowed to be sold by wholesalers or retailers in the open market. The Government of India has stipulated that Remdesivir injection will be routed to government hospitals through state missions under National Health Mission (NHM) while it will have to be routed through state drug controllers to private hospitals and nursing homes.Once companies get allotment orders from drug controllers, they deliver injections to the hospitals concerned and collect payment.‘Supply-demand is the root problem’State drug controller Dr Ritu Sahay on Wednesday said the root of the problem was huge the gap between supply and demand.She said most of the requisitions were hitherto from hospitals and nursing homes from Jharkhand, but they were now sending Remdesivir injections to other towns and cities.“Tata Motors Hospital was allotted Remdesivir injection Tuesday for the first time,” she said.“We fix the allotment order on the basis of the number of Covid-19 patients, number of Covid-19 patients on Remdesivir, and availability of vials. We are trying our best to rationalize the allotment as per the requisitions received. After we fix the allotment orders, it is sent to manufacturing companies concerned only after approval by a high-level committee. We are hoping against hope for things to improve from next week,” said Dr Sahay.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/ranchi-hospitals-get-a-lion-s-share-of-remdesivir-stock-101619063153073.html

22-04-2021||Pune||Pune recoveries go up but vaccination issues, post-Covid complications remain||Pune, which is one of the worst covid-affected regions in the country, recorded more than 10,000 cases on Wednesday. The city currently has more than 120,000 active cases and the death toll went up to 8,945 with 35 fresh fatalities. Pune city reported 5,538 new Covid-19 cases while Pune rural reported 2,998 new Covid-19 cases on Wednesday.Most deaths in Pune were reported among the 61-70 years age group and only 6% of this age group have received both doses of the Covid-19 vaccine. Pune has a population of more than 1 million people in this age group and only 64,000 have received both doses of the vaccine while at least 640,000 have received the first dose, as per the data from the district information office. Pune vaccinated 58,900 people on Wednesday, out of which most beneficiaries belonged to Pune rural. Pune recorded more than 620,000 recoveries with more than 11,000 recoveries.The hospital infrastructure in Pune remained stressed as small hospitals stopped taking new patients and advised relatives of patients to look for admission in multi-speciality hospitals as they struggled to accommodate Covid-19 patients.Smaller hospitals were vital in the fight against Covid-19 in the district but due to lack of oxygen, they are forced to refer patients to large multispeciality hospitals. “In initial days, smaller hospitals managed to provide support to bigger hospitals with oxygen, but now it is not possible. In multi-speciality hospitals they have two options - either they have their own oxygen plant or have cylinders. This is not the case with small hospitals,” Dr Sanjay Patil, chairman, Pune Hospital Board of India told HT.Several recovered patients in Pune reported getting infected by Mucormycosis which is a rare and serious fungal infection coupled with a high mortality rate. Every hospital in Pune is reporting 10 cases every month, according to a report by HT. “There is a high mortality rate while treating Mucormycosis, but surgery is the only option. If surgery is not performed then the infection is likely to spread to the brain,” Dr Sudhir Halikar, head of department, ENT, at Noble Hospital told HT.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pune-recoveries-go-up-but-vaccination-issues-post-covid-complications-remain-101619061305668.html

22-04-2021||Delhi||Covid-19 surge: Capital on the brink||In the last two days, several hospitals in Delhi have raised alarm over depleting oxygen supplies as the number of dependent patients has skyrocketed. Some got the stock only minutes from a disaster.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/covid19-surge-capital-on-the-brink-101619042452618.html
22-04-2021||Delhi||SOS in Capital, O2 politics at borders||At least 12 hospitals with more than 1,000 critically ill Covid-19 patients sent out distress calls to the government and over social media on Wednesday, warning that they were hours away from running out of oxygen, with some blaming neighbouring states for blocking supplies.The crisis pitted the Delhi government against the administrations in Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, where officials purportedly restricted trucks from leaving oxygen refilling units, and drew the intervention of the Union government.Later in the evening, one of the hospitals approached the Delhi high court, which pulled up the Union government for the second day in a row, following which the Centre gave the assurance that it will facilitate unobstructed supply. Hours earlier, the central government increased Delhi’s daily oxygen quote from 378 metric tonne (MT) to 480MT.The national capital at present has over 85,000 active cases of Covid-19, and 4,632 out of the 4,650 ICU beds for these patients were occupied as of 11pm on Wednesday. The surge in demand for oxygen for medical use is estimated to be around three times what is usual for the city.“We have been expressing concerns about it. There are two problems here. First, the central government has set a quota for oxygen but, in Delhi, the demand has increased significantly in light of the severe spread in Covid-19 cases...” said Manish Sisodia, Delhi’s deputy chief minister.The second, he added, was of logistics. “Even the oxygen as per the quota allocated to Delhi is not smoothly reaching Delhi,” he said, citing two instances where officials in Haryana’s Faridabad and Uttar Pradesh’s Modinagar purportedly stopped trucks from taking the supplies. The problems were resolved with the help of the Union government’s intervention, he added.“If we have to chase every single truck and ask Centre to intervene, then it’s not a good situation,” the deputy CM said, adding that the pandemic should not turn into “a fight between states”.Late on Tuesday night and on Wednesday, some of the replenishments reached the hospitals with minutes to spare; in two cases, hospitals switched to temporary cylinders as the tankers arrived too late to refill their systems.“If the oxygen gets over, patients on the ventilators will die within minutes and the others within a couple of hours. This is a matter of life and death,” said Sumit Ray, medical superintendent of Holy Family Hospital where 375 Covid-19 patients were admitted as on Wednesday evening. Of these, 325 were either on ventilator or oxygen, and oxygen was expected to last till Thursday, 11am.The Union government acknowledged the problem. “When you deal with such a huge challenge, then at times there is panic and confusions. But the onus and responsibility is on the Union government and state governments to work together and respond quickly,” said Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan, while adding that the deadlock over supply trucks not being allowed to leave from Faridabad was resolved minutes before he stepped into the weekly press conference on Covid-19 on Wednesday.The Centre said of the total 7,500 metric tonne of oxygen being produced in India per day, 6,600 MT, as on date, is being allocated to states for medical use and assured that efforts are being made to increase supplies in the coming days, and Bhushan said a 24x7 control room has been set up where state governments can raise problems of supplies and logistics.The crisis prompted a war of words between Delhi and Haryana. “We are being forced to give our oxygen to Delhi. First, we’ll complete our needs, then give to others. Yesterday, one of our oxygen tankers which was going to Faridabad, was looted by Delhi government. From now, I have ordered police protection for all tankers,” Haryana health minister Anil Vij said in the afternoon.Later, Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar spoke to Union health minister Harsh Vardhan and asked for its quota of oxygen supply too to be raised. Haryana’s chief secretary denied allegations by Delhi’s hospitals that it was not allowing vendors to send oxygen to them. ‘’No supply has been stopped to Delhi, this is not true,’’ chief secretary Vijai Vardhan said.Faridabad deputy commissioner Garima Mittal, who was named by some hospitals for stopping supplies from the oxygen refilling plants, denied the allegations.Officials in UP did not respond to requests for a comment but a person in the Modinagar administration, who asked not to be named, said there were no orders to stop the trucks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/sos-in-capital-o2-politics-at-borders-101619041065370.html
22-04-2021||Chandigarh||Bride fined ₹1,000 in Chandigarh for not wearing mask||All decked up for her wedding, a bride from Khanna fell short on one account – a face mask to shield her from coronavirus.The bride was headed to the Sector-8 gurdwara for her wedding, when the police spotted her car at the Sector 8-9 traffic lights. Everyone in the vehicle, including her brother and two children, had masks on, but her. All his efforts to convince the cops that his sister was not wearing a mask to protect her make-up failed to persuade the police, who let the siblings continue the journey only after the bride paid up a fine of ₹1,000. That’s one wedding anecdote that the bride is unlikely to ever forget!||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/bride-fined-1-000-in-chandigarh-for-not-wearing-mask-101619039565898.html
22-04-2021||Chandigarh||47% of Covid cases in Mohali in 26-45 age bracket||Patients aged between 26 and 45 accounted for 47% of the total Covid-19 cases reported in Mohali so far in April.The district’s figures, provided by the health department, are in line with the second wave trends in the country, where more young patients are getting infected.As many as 5,123 of the 10,917 patients between April 1 and 20 were in the 26-45 age group. Those in the 46-60 age bracket formed the second largest proportion of cases – 21%, followed by those aged over 60 at 14%. Youngsters aged between 16 and 25 constituted 13% cases, while those aged 15 and below made up 5% of the tally.61% deceased aged over 60 Among the 75 fatalities in the same period, 61% (46) were senior citizens, and 31% (23) were aged between 46 and 60. Patients in the 26-45 age group formed 7% of all deaths, and the district saw only one death among the population aged 16 to 25. More men infectedOf the total cases, 6,262 were men, 4,647 women and eight transgenders, while the deaths comprised 48 men and 27 women.Also, 47% cases (5,117) were reported from Mohali’s urban areas, followed by Dera Bassi sub-division with 29%, which comprises Dera Bassi, Dhakoli and Lalru that had 3,189 cases in these 20 days. Deputy commissioner Girish Dayalan said the younger population was moving about freely and socialising without any precautions, leading to more cases among them, while senior citizens were more cautious in dealing with the pandemic. Civil surgeon Dr Adarshpal Kaur said in the second surge, the UK variant of Covid-19 was spreading quickly across Punjab, as it had a higher transmission rate, and the youth not exercising safety measures was only making matters worse. “The urban areas are more affected with regards to daily cases, while the fatalities are higher in rural areas. Mohali is among the worst-affected districts in Punjab. Residents must wear masks and maintain social distancing while venturing out,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/47-of-covid-cases-in-mohali-in-26-45-age-bracket-101619039386533.html
22-04-2021||Delhi||With lives on the line, Delhi scrambles for oxygen lifeline||Over 1,000 critically ill Covid-19 patients in Delhi were in imminent danger in the last 24 hours after the hospitals they were in issued distress calls on Wednesday about their oxygen supplies running perilously low, with a bigger tragedy being averted with minutes to spare as frantic interventions by government officials helped secure replenishments.HT is aware of at least 11 facilities, whose executives either sent SOS letters to the government or spoke directly to report low stocks. At least six of them said the crisis was because officials in Uttar Pradesh and Haryana had stopped trucks from leaving the facilities, a problem that deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia too reported.The crisis came into focus late on Tuesday when officials announced GTB Hospital, with 500 patients, was to run out of oxygen by 2am, triggering a scramble that was closely watched on social media where thousands of people counted down the anxious hours. It was around 1.30am when the first images confirmed the arrival of a cryogenic truck from UP.Hours later, officials of Indraprastha hospital, Manipal hospital and Max hospital wrote to the government, flagging the crisis. Max hospital also moved the Delhi high court, which pulled up the Union government, a day after it had criticised it in another hearing over the same issue.“Over the past few days, we have been under extreme duress due to the interruptions and delays in supply of Liquid Medical Oxygen. On the intervening night of April 20 and 21... Their (supplier’s) officials informed us that due to local administration’s intervention in Greater Noida, the supply to Delhi has been stopped. While we used to have three days of oxygen supply in our inventory, this has not reduced to around 10-12 hours of supply,” said a letter from the Indraprastha Apollo hospital to the Delhi health minister, seen by HT.On Wednesday afternoon, Dr John Punnoose, associate medical director of St Stephen’s hospital, made a panicked call to HT. “We have oxygen stock left for just two hours and our supplier has been stopped at Haryana border. There are nearly 300 Covid-19 patients, most of who are on oxygen. In addition, we are running the casualty department and the operation theatres where oxygen is needed. There will a big problem if we do not get the oxygen in time,” he said, expecting to run out of supply by 6pm. The facility used some back-up cylinders, before its supply truck arrived at 6.45 pm.Delhi’s oxygen requirement has soared to nearly three times what is normal as a tsunami of Covid-19 infections has filled up city hospitals with serious and critical cases. The situation has prompted Delhi government officials to send out multiple requests to the central government, which manages oxygen stock distribution, to raise its quota, even the state and its neighbours exchanged allegations of impeding supplies.Big hospitals use liquid medical oxygen pumped through a gas pipeline in their wards. Oxygen cylinders can be attached to the supply line in cases of emergency, but need to be closely monitored and changed frequently.The smaller 34-bed nursing home Irene hospital in Kalkaji, which needs 150 cylinders, received only 30 on Wednesday morning. “We receive around 50 cylinders in three deliveries from our supplier. Today, we were given 30 cylinders in the morning with no assurance for further supply,” said Dr Mohd Shariq, the Covid-19 unit head at the hospital.The hospital sent its staff out to look for cylinders in the afternoon. “The staff has managed to get some cylinders and are on their way back now,” the hospital said at 7.30pm.Similar distress messages were sent by two other nursing homes. Rathi hospital in Najafgarh-Nangloi took to Twitter to announce they were running out of oxygen. The hospital uses up 360 cylinders a day for 78 Covid-19 patients it has. “We have an oxygen station nearby that fills our cylinder every two or three hours. They refused us in the afternoon today; saying they have no oxygen,” said Kaushtub Tiwari, head, marketing and operations at the hospital.After a frantic search, the hospital managed to get 31 cylinders from other nursing homes.At six in the evening, one of the city’s largest private hospitals in Northwest Delhi, Max hospital-Shalimar Bagh, issued a distress message. The hospital just had two hours of oxygen supply with no assurance of replenishment. The facility had run out of oxygen late on Tuesday and had to rely on cylinders sourced from other hospitals in the Max network.“Yesterday night, the oxygen supply to the hospital was disrupted as an oxygen tanker on its way to refill the oxygen tanks at Max hospital, Shalimar Bagh was diverted. This led to a situation where the hospital’s oxygen tanks ran dry,” said a letter from the hospital to the Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain.The crisis prompted a war of words between Delhi and Haryana. “We are being forced to give our oxygen to Delhi. First, we’ll complete our needs, then give to others. Yesterday, one of our oxygen tankers which was going to Faridabad, was looted by Delhi government. From now, I have ordered police protection for all tankers,” Haryana health minister Anil Vij said.Later, Delhi’s deputy CM said hospitals had reported that a supplier in Faridabad – which was meant to send the replenishments to Stephens and some of the others — stopped sending trucks since a Haryana official was restricting their departure.“If the oxygen gets over, patients on the ventilators will die within minutes and the others within a couple of hours. This is a matter of life and death,” said Sumit Ray, medical superintendent of Holy Family hospital where 375 Covid-19 patients were admitted as on Wednesday evening. Of these, 325 were either on ventilator or oxygen, and oxygen was expected to last till Thursday, 11am.Later, on Wednesday evening, doctors from Indraprastha Apollo hospital said they were waiting anxiously for their replenishments. “Yesterday, the hospital received its oxygen supply at 3am just an hour before the stock would get over. Today, we have supply till 1am. Now, we have to just wait for the supplier,” said a doctor from the hospital, asking not to be named.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/with-lives-on-the-line-delhi-scrambles-for-oxygen-lifeline-101619038664855.html
22-04-2021||Delhi||Row over Gautam Gambhir’s offer of free FabiFlu from his office||A tweet by BJP East Delhi MP Gautam Gambhir on Wednesday offering free antiviral drug Fabiflu from his local office triggered a row with the opposition accusing him of hoarding the drug and questioning him if he could distribute it legally.Fabiflu is widely used in managing symptoms of Covid-19 patients and is currently available in short supply in the city with the cases of the viral disease rising at an unprecedented pace.“People of East Delhi can get ‘Fabiflu’ from MP office (2, Jagriti Enclave) for FREE between 10-5. Kindly get Aadhar & prescription,” Gambhir tweeted on Wednesday afternoon. However, the former cricketer-turned-politician didn’t specify how he managed to the get supply of the medicine which can only be bought on a doctor’s prescription.AAP accused the BJP MP of hoarding the medicine. AAP leader Durgesh Pathak tweeted, “Gujarat — BJP president hoarding life saving injections. Maharastra — BJP EX CM fadnavis hoarding remdesivir. Delhi’s part-time BJP MP and full-time cricket commentator hoarding life saving medicines. Public representatives or criminals? You decide,” AAP leader Durgesh Pathak tweeted.Senior Congress leader Pawan Khera raised questions on how Gambhir procured the medicine. Khera tweeted, “1) How much Fabiflu do you have in your possession? 2) How did you procure so much of Fabiflu? @GautamGambhir. CC @ArvindKejriwal: 1) Is this legal? 2) Is the shortage of Fabiflu at chemists’ shops due to such unauthorised procurement/distribution?”Gambhir didn’t comment on the matter. However, he posted another tweet in the evening. “Delhi is my home & I will keep serving the people till my last breath. With many requests for beds, oxygen & medicines, we are helping as many as we can!,” he tweeted.Responding to allegations of hoarding he tweeted, “Those who allowed Remdesivir to be black marketed at more than 30 thousand a vial & hospital beds to be sold for 5-10 Lakh in Delhi are concerned that a few hundred Fabiflu strips are being given for FREE to the poor. That’s their understanding of “Hoarding” #HumanLivesMatter”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/row-over-gautam-gambhir-s-offer-of-free-fabiflu-from-his-office-101619037923762.html
22-04-2021||Delhi||HC tells Centre to ensure supply on hospital’s appeal||“We cannot see people dying for the lack of oxygen,” said the Delhi high court on Wednesday as it nudged the Centre into ensuring sufficient quantity of medical oxygen for patients in Delhi along with an unobstructed passage of the cylinders to the national capital from different states.“The citizen can only fall back on the State and it is your duty to provide. Beg, borrow or steal but you must provide. And it is our bounden duty to make sure people’s fundamental right to life is not curtailed,” said a bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Rekha Palli said in an urgent late evening hearing that started around 8 pm and ended at 10.40 pm.The hearing saw both the judges exhorting the Central government to make certain that no death happens in Delhi due to shortage of supply of oxygen after Max Hospitals complained that they were running short on oxygen and were down to only a few hours of supply in some facilities.“Today it is Max before us but there could be several other hospitals which have the same problem. The shortage is there and it is there for everyone to see. We cannot shut our eyes to this. You can’t say we can’t provide only this much and no more and let people die. That can’t be an answer from a sovereign government and we are not ready to accept such an answer. We can’t see people dying because they don’t have oxygen,” the bench told solicitor general Tushar Mehta, who appeared for the Union government in the matter.It added: “We are in dire straits. Hundreds and thousands of lives are lost because of lack of oxygen. As a sovereign state, it is your responsibility to make sure sufficient oxygen is there. You can’t turn around and say you don’t have more oxygen. You cannot say that we can only provide this and if people are dying, let them die. That cannot be an answer by a responsible and sovereign state. You just draw on oxygen from captive industries and do everything else. And if some of the plants are to be shut, so be it. But people can’t lose lives because of oxygen.”The court also cited the tragedy in a Nashik hospital, where 24 lives were lost due to a leak in an oxygen tank.On his part, the S-G submitted that the Centre was committed to procuring maximum quantity of oxygen from all possible sources and its duty was confined to allocate it equitably to all the states. About Delhi, Mehta informed that the allocation to the capital was increased from 378 MT to 480 MT and it was now for the Delhi government to get its transported from the points of procurement.Delhi government’s standing counsel Rahul Mehra agreed with the S-G about the hike in the oxygen allocation and expressed his gratitude but sought police protection during the transit.Mehta assured the court that the Centre will ascertain safe passage for the oxygen cylinders to Delhi.The bench then recorded the statement by the S-G about the increase in allocation and the safe passage while deferring the matter for a hearing on Thursday when the issue of diversion of oxygen from captive plants will be taken up.During the hearing, the bench observed that supply of medical oxygen should be stopped for industrial use and even the amendment—that the plants having captive oxygen can continue their production—does not help as it is an “emergent situation”.“Every citizen is entitled to that protection. In such a situation, you are saying that the industry would not be stopped. How are your officers not looking at the situation?” the bench asked Mehta.Mehta said that the order of stopping oxygen to the industries was sought to be earlier implemented from April 22 in wake of the time required for the technical shut down, which was given to implement the order.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/hc-tells-centre-to-ensure-supply-on-hospital-s-appeal-101619037612695.html

22-04-2021||Delhi||Delhi Police create green corridors for movement of oxygen containers||Police on Tuesday evening again stepped in to create a green corridor and resolve the oxygen shortage at a north Delhi Covid-19 hospital, after being alerted about an agitation by anxious relatives of 80 Covid patients admitted there.Police said it took them exactly 98 minutes to arrange the cylinders for NKS Super Speciality Hospital in Gulabi Bagh.Ever since Covid hospitals started running low on oxygen, the police have been receiving requests from individuals and hospitals to help arrange oxygen.On Sunday, the outer Delhi district police arranged 20 cylinders for a hospital in Nangloi where 35 patients were admitted. The south-east police arranged 15 cylinders for the Holy Family Hospital and Jeevan Hospital.On Wednesday, the police arranged oxygen for several hospitals and individuals across the city. According to the NKS Super Speciality Hospital CEO, DS Chatwal, nearly 80 of the 102 Covid patients there were dependent on oxygen and the supply was depleting by late Tuesday.“We had movable small cylinders as a last resort. Lives of 80 patients were at risk,” said Chatwal.Relatives of these 80 patients grew restless when they got to know of the shortage. “They began agitating and the situation was taking an untoward turn when the hospital made a distress call to the police,” said Anto Alphonse, deputy commissioner of police (north).The DCP and other officers reached the hospital soon after. “We pacified the relatives and then began arranging the oxygen,” said Alphonse.Police got 53 empty cylinders refilled on priority from a unit in Mayapuri Industrial Area, after speaking to its owner. The team set off for the hospital the moment the first set of 15 cylinders were filled. “We set up a green corridor and covered a distance of 13km in less than 20 minutes,” said a police officer. The 15 cylinders reached by 6.08pm and the remaining 38 an hour later, police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-police-create-green-corridors-for-movement-of-oxygen-containers-101619037345426.html
22-04-2021||Gurugram||Officially, only 8 died of Covid in Gurugram in 2 days, but crematoriums handle over 100 such bodies||The health department in Gurugram reported four Covid-19 deaths on Tuesday and four more on Wednesday, but cremation ground staff say they have performed the last rites of at least 106 bodies, as per Covid-19 protocols, over the past two days(till 10pm Wednesday). While a few of these bodies were sent from Ghaziabad and Delhi, a majority of them are from Gurugram, the staffers said.The crematorium records, accessed by Hindustan Times, show that the Sector 32 crematorium alone recorded 17 and 40 Covid-19 deaths of city residents on Tuesday and Wednesday, respectively, while the Madanpuri crematorium recorded 23 and 26 Covid-19 deaths, respectively, over the past two days. According to the health department data, however, 13 deaths were reported in the past three days from Gurugram, including five on Monday. Sandeep Sharma, the in-charge of Mokshdham cremation ground in Sector 32, said, “Over 45 bodies arrived within the past 12 hours (from Wednesday noon). Of these, 40 were of Covid-19 deaths from Gurugram. The others were from Ghaziabad and New Delhi. In the past four days, the count of bodies has increased and we have been cremating bodies till 11 in the night.” Also Read | Bengal reports highest daily spike of 10,784 Covid-19 cases, 58 new fatalities“We fill all details of the deceased and follow protocols set by the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG). All bodies of Covid-19 deaths cremated here are recorded,” he said. Sharma said they receive at least eight to 10 calls daily from people informing them of Covid-19 deaths at home and enquiring about funeral proceedings. In some cases, the Covid-19 test reports are awaited, but cremation is done as per Covid-19 protocols. Such cases are not recorded as Covid deaths, he said.Officials of the health department attributed the discrepancy in numbers to differences in protocols followed by the MCG. The health department data shows that 31 deaths were recorded in the district from April 1 to 21.Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, Gurugram, said, “Only those deaths confirmed by hospitals as Covid-19 are shown as official in the health department bulletin. The crematorium data comes under the MCG.” However, officials of the MCG said their data is based on hospital reports.Also Read | Jharkhand reports 4,969 new Covid-19 cases, 45 deathsAshish Singla, chief medical officer (CMO), MCG, said, “We collect death summary and Covid-19 positive reports. We are not aware why the data of the health department is not matching with crematoria data. We are collecting our data on a daily basis.”The city has three Covid-19 cremation grounds at Sector 32, Sukhrali village near Atul Kataria Chowk, and Madan Puri near Pataudi Chowk, while three burial grounds have been earmarked in Sector 58 near the Power House, Sector 58 near Ghata village, and Badshahpur village. Singla said they presently have two dedicated ambulances for transporting Covid-19 bodies to crematoriums from hospitals and that two more vehicles will be addedto handle the surge. “The two ambulances are transporting over 30 Covid-19 bodies daily. Before handing over the bodies to the ambulance drivers, the hospital staff issue death summary and Covid-19 positive reports and these are duly handed over to the crematorium staff,” he said. Amit Kumar (33), a private ambulance driver for the past 10 years, said on average, he is transporting two Covid-19 bodies to cremation grounds daily. “I have never seen this kind of rush. There is no space to even park vehicles and bodies are lined up on platforms,” he said. A spot check by an HT team at the Madanpuri cremation ground found that bodies were lined up on all 26 cremation platforms, of which two are electric. Grieving kin in PPE overalls stood at a distance and watched as MCG workers placed the bodies on pyres. A team of four workers prepared one pyre after another, as ambulances kept arriving without a break. “The rush has been ongoing for days. Families are not allowed to come near the body. The family member who has to perform the last rites lights the torch. But it is the MCG worker who puts the torch to the pyre,” said Vinod Kumar, who has been working 12-hour shifts at the electric crematorium since the pandemic started. “Every day, over 30 bodies of Covid-19 patients arrive here for last rites,” he said. Also Watch | How HC slammed Centre on Delhi hospitals’ Oxygen SOS, The 5 Key ObservationsIt is in the last week that hospitalisation has increased dramatically from at least 171 on April 1 to 806 on Wednesday, stretching the existing health infrastructure to saturation point. The situation is constantly deteriorating due to a record surge in daily new infections. Gurugam on Wednesday reported 2,988 new infections, the highest single-day spike since the outbreak of the pandemic. The total number of cases now stands at 88,866, of which 16,027 are active. Families of Covid-19 victims continued to opt for last rites instead of electric cremations, even as protocols state that electric cremations should be preferred to avoid the spread of infection. “There are only two electric furnaces, but most of the people refuse an electric cremation. Since rituals take time, there is a waiting time of at least an hour for a cremation on platforms,” said Kumar. The teams performing last rites have undergone basic training on sanitising the body, covering it in a transparent, protective sheet even as families watch from a distance. MCG officials said the ashes are handed over to the family later. Singla said the ambulances are thoroughly disinfected with isopropyl alcohol hydrochloride upon returning to the MCG’s health branch office in Sector 39, where the vehicles are stationed. “To ensure there is no contact with the driver, each ambulance has two compartments, separating the space where the body is kept from the driver,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gurugram-8-covid-19-deaths-in-2-days-but-106-cremations-performed-101619029119845.html

When onlookers raised alarm, the accused fled from the spot. We rushed him to Amritsar civil hospital, where he succumbed to injuries.”The accused have been identified as Narinder Singh, Bhupinder Singh, Jaspal Singh, Harjinder Singh, Mukhtiyar Singh, Sewa Singh and Ranjit Singh, all residents of the same village.Investigating officer Himanshu Bhagat said, “Baljinder had an old enmity with Harjinder Singh. The duo was involved in a cross-case lodged in 2020 under sections 326 and 307 of the Indian Penal Code. Due to this enmity, the accused, along with his six aides, killed Baljinder.”He added, “Harjinder has been arrested, while raids are on to nab the other absconding accused.

22-04-2021||Chandigarh||Model Moga village devises its own health, pension plans||From giving pension to widows, elderly and disabled persons to providing health insurance to the underprivileged and needy, Ransih Kalan village in Moga district’s Nihal Singh Wala subdivision has shown the way in building a welfare model for its residents. The panchayat is providing these facilities by pooling a part of income of residents through ‘daswandh’ (giving 1/10th of earnings) system and with the help of the NRI fraternity. It started the pension and health insurance schemes five months ago. The village had received two awards — Nanaji Deshmukh Rashtriya Gaurav Gram Sabha Puraskar and Deen Dayal Upadhyay Panchayat Sashaktikaran Puraskar — last year from the central government for the development works it undertook. Former sarpanch Preet Inder Pal Singh, 31, who is also son of present village head Kuldeep Kaur, says, “Our panchayat has no affiliation to any political party. I had won as an independent candidate and now, my mother is leading the village. There is no interference of any party and we are taking decisions independently.” The village currently has 70 pension beneficiaries and is offering health insurance to 25 residents. Widows, elderly and disabled persons whose applications for pension were rejected by the government, despite being eligible for the same, are getting ₹750 per month as pension. “We found that our people were making rounds of government offices to avail the pension and were being harassed. We called a panchayat meeting and started a pension scheme on the pattern of the state government. Also, we are providing health cover up to ₹1 lakh per person at any hospital. Nine people have already availed the benefit,” says Kuldeep Kaur. The village is also encouraging the locals not to burn paddy stubble by giving ₹500 per acre as compensation to marginal farmers. Nearly 100 farmers had availed the benefit last year, it was claimed. Kuldeep says, “All these things were done in the past six years by spending ₹5 crore. Whenever we require money for health insurance or other development works, we inform the local residents and the NRIs, who help us immediately. It is just a beginning.” Treating sewage for irrigation purpose Harjeet Kaur, 35, a panchayat member, says, “The villagers built a sewerage system themselves. We had also set up a sewage treatment plant and have been using treated wastewater for irrigation on 100 acres since 2016. A pond was also constructed to accumulate rainwater for irrigation and other purposes.” “Besides, we have made arrangements to reuse wastewater from water purifier systems and air-conditioners in the households,” she adds. Parkash Singh, 70, another panchayat member, says, “We organise a camp every two months to make our village plastic-free. At the camp, we sell ration and other goods and accept payment via plastic only. Now, people have started stocking polythene bags and other plastic items. We send the plastic to a factory in Ludhiana for recycling.” Jagjit Singh Bal, district development and panchayat officer, says, “We have already started work at other villages on the lines of Ransih Kalan. Some villages of Kot Ise Khan block have adopted this model as well.” “Though there are several examples of infrastructure developments in villages, I did not see such initiatives of welfare schemes anywhere else. I have worked in many districts but nowhere pension and health cover were being provided to residents by the panchayat, except Ransih Kalan village,” he adds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/model-moga-village-devises-its-own-health-pension-plans-101619037045443.html

22-04-2021||Chandigarh||Tarn Taran zila parishad chief’s son slights SDM over land mutation row||A bitter war of words has erupted between the family of Congress party’s Tarn Taran Zila Parishad chairperson Harcharanjit Kaur and sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) Rajneesh Arora over the mutation of land at Chaudhari Wala village. Kaur’s son used derogatory remarks against the magistrate on his Facebook page, while the latter accused the family of trying to bribe him to get illegal work done.Arora said Kaur’s family has been pressuring him to do “illegal” work of transferring a land in her family’s name despite a court’s stay order. He also alleged that local MLA Dr Dharambir Agnihotri has also been coaxing him to favour Kaur’s family. Kaur son, Vishal Sharma alias Sonu, who stays abroad, on his Facebook page asked the SDM not to create “obstacles deliberately” in the case. “We don’t want to be offensive,” he said, adding that, “Don’t teach a wrong lesson to your senior officers. Work impartially.”While replying to a comment in the post, he wrote: “…He is a sincere man….He has also put his stomach ahead (he is a corrupt man)….We respect him, but he doesn’t want to.” Sonu’s father Charanjit Sharma, a former Market Committee chairman, said he was aware of the post by his son. “I had asked him to do so,” he said.The SDM said he will send the screenshots of the remarks to deputy commissioner (DC) Kulwant Singh, seeking action against him. “The family wanted to involve me in the illegal work. Even the local MLA asked me to favour the family. They also offered me bribe, but I declined. A patwari is hand in glove with the family. Lately, I have transferred my reader Gursharan Singh who used to pass secret official information to the family,” Arora said.He said, “The family claims to have one kanal land in the village. The land of the village was consolidated in 1976. The family says they were given 5.6-kanal land from the consolidated land instead of their one kanal. A court had stayed the transfer of land in 2004. After this, the family filed a petition in Punjab and Haryana High court in 2008. The petition was accepted, but the family never approached the court again. The matter is still pending in the court.”He said there were many more technicalities in the case and he has already explained the entire matter to his superiors.Charanjit Sharma said, “I will approach the Punjab chief minister if the SDM continues to work against us. If we can’t get our work done when our party is in power, where will we go?” He said the SDM was deliberately creating obstacles in their case.MLA Agnihotri said he never interfered in the case. “The law should take its course. The matter was in my knowledge as a few months ago, the opposite party had assured in writing that they will not raise any objection if the mutation is done in the name of the chairperson’s family.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/tarn-taran-zila-parishad-chief-s-son-slights-sdm-over-land-mutation-row-101619036929315.html

On Tuesday alone, 242 men and women from the force tested positive for the virus, the Delhi Police said.A statement released by the police on Wednesday said Covid care centres have been opened in Shahdara and Rohini, while the one is Dwarka is yet to become operational.The Shahdara Covid care centre is the biggest of the three with 78 beds, of which 20 are equipped with oxygen supply. The Rohini facility has 20 beds, half of which are equipped with oxygen.Chinmoy Biswal, spokesperson, Delhi Police, said more facilities are being set up for police personnel and their families. “These facilities, which will work as Covid care centres for Delhi Police personnel and their families, were set up for the immediate relief of patients till the time they get an admission at a regular Covid hospital,” he said.The facility and medicines at these centres will be provided from the police resources.

22-04-2021||Chandigarh||Senate elections: PU yet to get permission from Haryana to set up polling booths||Panjab University is yet to get permission from the Haryana government to set up polling booths in the state for the conduct of senate elections, varsity officials said on Wednesday.The polls are scheduled to begin from April 26. The polling booths of different constituencies of the PU senate are to be set up in Punjab, Haryana, Uttarakhand, Delhi, Himachal Pradesh and Rajasthan.Besides Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, Delhi, Uttarakhand and Rajasthan have already given permission to PU to set up polling booths there. However, permission from Haryana, where 29 booths are to be set up for the senate polls, is still pending.PU has already sent a reminder to Haryana earlier this month for the permission after the high court told the university to conduct the senate polls within two months.A senior official of Haryana government, who didn’t wish to be named, said, “We are in the process of allowing PU to set up the polling booth.” However, chief secretary Vijai Vardhan could not be contacted.The polls were earlier scheduled for August last year but were postponed twice by vice-chancellor Raj Kumar due to the pandemic. The last senate elections were held in 2016. The senate is a 91-member apex governing body of the university. While 36 senators are nominated by the chancellor, two are from the Punjab legislative assembly, six are ex-officio members and the remaining 47 are elected from different constituencies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/senate-elections-pu-yet-to-get-permission-from-haryana-to-set-up-polling-booths-101619036639264.html
22-04-2021||Delhi||RWAs struggle to run community centres due to shortage of staff||Two days after district administrations identified at least 31 locations to set up community Covid-19 care centres with an aim to add 541 beds with oxygen supply to the city’s health infrastructure, several residents’ welfare associations (RWAs) on Wednesday said they were not being able to start the facilities despite all arrangements being in place due to unavailability of doctors, nurses, and other medical staff.Several RWAs and NGOs on Wednesday said though the district administration was providing them oxygen cylinders or concentrators, they were not able to find staff that could use them. They demanded that the government and district administrations help with human resources to run the facilities.Hardeep Singh Bhalla, president of the Sainik Farms RWA, said a 60-bed Covid isolation centre located in a municipal school in Pushp Vihar, which only caters to asymptomatic patients, has been identified for conversion into a community Covid-19 care centre.“We have only medical support staff working with us 24x7 since all our patients are asymptomatic, and doctors only visit in case of an emergency. But, if we will have to set up beds with oxygen support and admit patients with mild symptoms, we will need professionals. We need a doctor there at least for two hours every day and some full-time nurses,” he said.Arun Kumar, a member of Seva Bharti, an NGO that has agreed to start a community Covid care centre in Paharganj with 30 beds, said: “Some doctors living in the locality have agreed to provide part-time services since they already have prior commitments. We need some permanent doctors.”Some RWAs said that most of the doctors residing in their locality do not have training in handling Covid-19 patients. Dr. Ruby Makhija, secretary of Navjeevan Vihar RWA, said, “I am an ophthalmologist and someone else here is a dermatologist... we cannot look after Covid-19 patients. We are more than willing to help. We can arrange for funds, foods, and other things, but without a medical team we cannot run a facility with Covid patients having mild symptoms.”Some groups who have managed to arrange for doctors said it wasn’t easy to find them. Arvind Mehta, president of an RWA in New Rajendra Nagar, who has set up a centre in a school in coordination with the team of area MLA Raghav Chadha, said they have managed to get three doctors for now.Officials in several districts acknowledged that the unavailability of doctors and nursing staff has become a major obstacle in starting community Covid care centers. “Doctors, nurses, and medical staff are already overburdened with work in their hospitals and clinics. We can’t let RWAs or NGOs start facilities without proper doctors,” said an official in the central Delhi district administration.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/rwas-struggle-to-run-community-centres-due-to-shortage-of-staff-101619036529171.html
22-04-2021||Chandigarh||Panjab University clears 13 cases for counting of past service||Panjab University has cleared the cases of 13 teachers who had sought that their past service be counted into their total service period.The cases were approved by vice- chancellor Raj Kumar based on the recommendation made last year by an eight-member panel headed by the dean university instructions (DUI). The panel was constituted to look into any pending cases in which past service has not been counted towards total service period for promotion and retirement benefit.The counting of past service has remained one of the important issues at PU in recent years. It was one of the main agendas during the last election of the Panjab University Teachers Association (PUTA).In its last meeting, the PU panel cleared 11 cases, observing that they are similar to the case of Namita Gupta from PU’s centre for human rights, which was approved by the senate in 2017. The other two cases have been cleared stating that they are covered as per the policy (for counting of past service) framed by PU and approved by the syndicate in 2019.52 cases in pipelineHowever, 52 teachers whose cases are in the pipeline have been asked to submit requisite documents to the varsity, as recommended by the panel last year. PUTA president Mritunjay Kumar said, “We welcome the initiative taken by the university. PUTA has been demanding this for the last few years. We are hopeful that the pending cases are also cleared.”In February last year, PU had decided to provide benefits of past services to teachers with pending cases, who claimed that their past experience was not counted.Issue arose in 2017The issue of counting of past services of teachers arose in 2017, when over 100 PU professors submitted their papers, claiming that their past services were not counted while considering the promotion of teachers under the Career Advancement Scheme (CAS).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/panjab-university-clears-13-cases-for-counting-of-past-service-101619036575149.html
22-04-2021||Chandigarh||One-day lockdown on Ram Navami largely successful in Chandigarh||The one-day lockdown imposed by the Chandigarh administration on Wednesday was largely successful as markets within sectors remained closed and popular spots like Sukhna Lake, Sector 17 and Rock Garden wore a deserted look.It was imposed on the occasion of Ram Navami to control the Covid spread amid a sharp spike in cases the last month.There was thin traffic on roads, though at certain points like Zirkapur-Chandigarh border, there were traffic snarls as police stopped vehicles for checking.UT adviser Manoj Parida said, “Yes, it was effectively enforced by the police. Even by stopping ten gatherings, we will have prevented 100 infections, on average. Since it was a holiday, inconvenience was minimal. Infection from large temple gatherings have been prevented.”Shops rendering essential services like grocery and vegetable stores and medicine shops were allowed to stay open. Even though only home delivery was allowed by the administration during the lockdown, in some areas, people were seen walking to shops to buy goods.Police had to intervene in some areas like Burail to get shops closed which were opened in the morning.The UT transport department operated 50% of CTU buses, even as most of these went vacant, with very few commuters on the road. Meanwhile, Aam Aadmi Party Chandigarh demanded that an all-party meeting be called by the UT administrator immediately, to frame a substantive policy to deal with the Covid situation. Earlier, Congress had also demanded the same.AAP has opposed the weekend and one-day lockdowns in Chandigarh. Meanwhile, while a section of Congress leadership has opposed the lockdown, another led by Congress councillor Devinder Singh Babla has favoured a 15-day lockdown.A senior UT official said, “The administration will discuss the imposition of weekend lockdown and the lockdown for longer duration in its Friday’s Covid review meeting.”Four FIRs lodged As many as 30 challans were issued for not wearing masks in public, 255 for not maintain social distancing and 80 for spitting in public. As many as four FIRs were lodged for violating lockdown and four were arrested. Fine was collected amounting to ₹2.35 lakh.Seven FIRs in Mohali for lockdown violationsDespite complete lockdown imposed in Mohali district on Wednesday, seven FIRs were registered by police against people for moving around and opening of shops. A case has also been registered against popular eatery Nik Baker’s for opening their shop in Phase 7. All shops had been asked to remain closed expect those rendering essential services.Also, two owners of an immigration firm in Phase 1 were held flouting for flouting lockdown norms. The accused have been identified as Karmjit Singh Sandhu, a resident of Phase 1 and Pradeep Singh, a resident of Daun village in Mohali, owners of “Brilliant Consultants”.Satinder Singh, senior superintendent of police (SSP), said, around 32 nakas were set up in Mohali city and the seven cases were registered under Section 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) of Indian Penal Code.Also, 446 people were challaned for not wearing masks and not maintaining social distancing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/oneday-lockdown-on-ram-navami-largely-successful-in-chandigarh-101619036569959.html
22-04-2021||Other||Cremation count casts doubt over Covid death data in Chandigarh and Panchkula||Even as official numbers indicate there have been 42 Covid deaths in Chandigarh so far in April, the cremation grounds in the city say the number is as high as 70, pointing to discrepancy between the health department data and the situation on the ground. Even in Panchkula, according to the administration, 18 people died due to coronavirus in the same period, while the number reported by the city’s only cremation ground in Sector 20 is 30.Similarly, in March, officially there were 26 Covid deaths in Chandigarh, but 33 cremations were carried out.In Panchkula, the bulletin showed five deaths, while there were 15 cremations in March.Apart from the traditional and LPG crematorium in Sector 25, Chandigarh, the cremation ground in Industrial Area also takes care of last rites of Covid patients from the city. Another such facility in Manimajra does not cremate Covid patients.At the Sector 25 crematorium, 49 Covid patients from Chandigarh have been cremated in April so far, while the number is 21 at the Industrial Area ground.No test report sought at UT’s crematoriumsCovid cremations in Chandigarh are mostly taken care of by members of the Red Cross. Families of the deceased also bring bodies directly after informing the crematoriums. But, there is no protocol to seek a Covid report or conduct a test before the last rites. According to the caretakers, the daily details of cremations, including those of Covid patients and those brought by families, are forwarded to the municipal corporation (MC). But, it remains unclear, if the data is calibrated thereon.Dr Amandeep Kang, director, health services, said if a patient dies at home, the family must get a Covid test conducted for consistency in the figures.“If there is a Covid death in any city hospital, our surveillance cell gets the information. All hospital deaths are tested for Covid. Perhaps, people are going to the cremation ground and writing the cause of death as Covid in absence of a facility to verify it,” she said.Stating that there was no question of hiding fatalities, UT adviser Manoj Parida said there was a protocol in place at the hospitals, and every death was counted for and timely information was provided to all stakeholders.Families may be providing Panchkula address: DCOn the discrepancy in the numbers in Panchkula, deputy commissioner Mukul Kumar said at times, attendants from other cities and states gave a Panchkula address at the cremation ground, despite not being from here. “To avoid any mismatch in figures, their addresses are cross-checked by health department teams and the data is updated accordingly,” he added.However, a worker at the Sector-20 crematorium, said, “We always ask for a copy of the deceased’s Aadhaar card and another of a family member, which is used to record the address. Besides, why would anyone give a wrong address of the deceased?”Overall cremations risingWith the surging Covid-19 cases, the number of overall cremations in both cities has also risen between March and April. According to the three crematoriums in Chandigarh, they have carried out 393 cremations in April so far, while the number in the corresponding period in March was 284. In Panchkula, against 36 cremations through March, the city’s sole crematorium recorded another 47 within 20 days of April.However, the facilities aren’t under stress, as they have the capacity to conduct a lot more cremations should the need arise. The Industrial Area crematorium for instance, has the capacity to perform 24 cremations a day, but so far, the maximum has only been six.“It’s true that Covid-19 deaths are being underreported in the country, as many deaths at home could also have been due to Covid. At the same time, there is a possibility that people with other ailments aren’t getting proper medical care, as hospitals are burdened with Covid-19 patients, leading to more casualties,” said Dr Rajesh Kumar, former head, community medicine, and dean, PGIMER.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/cremation-count-casts-doubt-over-covid-death-data-in-chandigarh-and-panchkula-101619036445838.html
22-04-2021||Delhi||Call for help: Residents dial 112 as infections rise||As Covid-19 infections continue to surge across the Capital, residents are calling the police helpline number 112 requesting all sorts of help -- from arranging ambulances and oxygen cylinders for patients to getting tested for Covid-19.According to police control room (PCR) data, seen by Hindustan Times, the 112 number is getting over 500 calls every day for the past few days, and the police expect this to rise over the rest of the week.The calls to 112 are different from those received by the Covid-19 helpline -- 011-23469900 -- launched by police last week. That helpline receives around 900 calls daily, and a majority of them are regarding movement passes during the six-day curfew that kicked in on Monday night, as well as queries about the coronavirus disease itself.The police data is indicative of the scale of the crisis the city is facing. To be sure, there are dedicated helplines for hospitals beds, medicines and medical aid that have been flooded with calls.PCR call data for April shows that the most number of calls were related to unavailability of ambulances. On Tuesday, the control room received 210 calls from citizens who complained that they were unable to get a government or private ambulance. A day before that, the 112 number received 152 calls for ambulance services. Police, without revealing the exact numbers, said crime-related calls have dropped over the past few days, and attributed this to the night curfew and the ongoing curfew.Police said these calls had increased all of a sudden. Data shows that on April 1, there were only three such calls, followed by two on April 2, and three on April 3. The data shows that calls for ambulance services increased after April 5, when the national capital started recording at least 5,000 cases daily -- the 5,000-mark was breached on April 6 with 5,100 cases and cases have been rising steadily since then -- putting a strain on the health facilities.The positivity rate of the disease has also increased to over 30% in the last few days -- it was 32.82% on Tuesday. This means that one in every three persons tested was turning out positive for the disease. Apart from calls for ambulances, police are receiving an average of 10 calls requesting oxygen cylinders. On Tuesday, 15 such calls were received. Police officers manning the telephone lines said these calls were mostly from hospitals short on supply.A senior police officer, who did not wish to be named, said: “On Tuesday, as reports poured in from the control room and police stations about medical professionals requesting oxygen cylinders, a meeting was held by the police brass at the headquarters. A message was sent to everyone on the field that such calls were to be given priority. Personnel posted in PCR vans were told to wear PPE kits and use the vans as ambulances when needed. Every police station was told to gather information about oxygen cylinders and ensure that it reached hospitals. The traffic police was told to coordinate with other units and open a ‘green corridor’ for vehicles carrying oxygen to hospitals. As soon as the meeting was over, around 3.15pm, a 71-year-old lady who lives alone in Bharat Nagar suffered a critical reduction in oxygen levels -- it dropped below 50, from an optimum of 95% or higher. Our officers went to her house and got her admitted to the Deep Chand Bandu hospital. Such interventions are too many to detail.”On Wednesday, for example, a call was received from doctors of Amarleela Hospital in west Delhi’s Janakpuri. The caller informed the police that the lives of 32 Covid patients were at risk as their oxygen stock was “nearly finished”. Delhi Police spokesperson Chinmoy Biswal said,” Our police team immediately contacted oxygen cylinder suppliers in and around the area. They found one in Kirti Nagar. An emergency response vehicle, which is normally used for security reasons, was rushed to the storage point to collect cylinders. They then went to Gole Market and Mayapuri to arrange for more cylinders. They finally managed to find 11 cylinders.”Until Wednesday afternoon, police received four such calls on the day.The PCR vans were also doubling as hearse vans to transport bodies to the crematoriums and cemeteries, officials said.On Sunday, the control room received information about a 93-year-old woman dying of Covid-19 in Dwarka, and her family members searching for a hearse. A PCR van transported her body to the hospital, and later to the cremation ground. Unlike last year, the control room was flooded with calls about lack of food and supplies during the lockdown, this month, police have received only 11 such calls. In the first week of April last year (first two weeks of the nationwide lockdown), the 112 number received at least 100 such calls.“There were no calls related to food or starvation in the past two days. On April 17 and 18, there were three and six calls respectively, but that was more about delivery of food because of the weekend lockdown,” a second officer said, asking not to be named.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/call-for-help-residents-dial-112-as-infections-rise-101619036292824.html
22-04-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: Coming of age, in the pandemic||He is 13, old enough to realise that “eating my favourite veg pizza is not wise these days”.A typical pizza is expensive, Om Kumar explains, and his craze for it would be a drag on his “Papa’s” diminished resources. His father runs a tea stall in Gurugram’s Sector 14. Chatting this afternoon on WhatsApp video, Mr Kumar, an 8th standard student, gives a bleak picture of his days in the family’s one-room apartment, as the current wave of the coronavirus pandemic is raging on with full blast in the world outside.“My PC (desktop computer) stopped working five months ago. I had a tablet but the battery started having problems a month back. So now I’m attending online school classes on Papa’s mobile.”The family only has one smartphone and it has to be shared between the tea stall owner and his two sons. Mr Kumar’s mother, Bheeba Devi, lives in their native village in Madhubani, Bihar.If there had not been a pandemic, and if his father’s business had remained as stable and reasonably profitable as it was early last year, Mr Kumar might have purchased a new laptop. That would have been useful not only for his immediate studies but also for his long-term goal — his ambition is to become a cyber security expert.But the world is in a dreadful shape, and we can’t take anything for granted any longer, says young Mr Kumar. He talks with the gravitas of a person mature beyond his years. Sometimes, when he would hang out at his father’s stall, “I would survey the ongoing situation by talking to customers, and through them I discovered that things are very bad, and that there is not much hope for better days.”One month ago, exasperated by his younger brother Abhishek’s fondness for chhole kulche and momos, his father was obliged to tell them that he was facing a severe financial crunch, and that it would be “wiser not to spend money on fast food and just eat the meals cooked at home for cheap”.The last time Mr Kumar had his beloved pizza was two years ago, he recalls, in a Pizza Hut outlet. The young man notes that his family has survived the precious year’s pandemic-ridden lockdown by digging into the father’s savings. This time there are no savings, he says.Even so, Mr Kumar remains hopeful for his near and distant future. “Next year I will get a new laptop... and I’m sure I’ll become a cyber security expert, with a good job in my own Gurgaon.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-coming-of-age-in-the-pandemic-101619036046536.html

When frisked, 1.10kg heroin was recovered from the car,” he said.On questioning, Manjit told the police that they had bought the drugs from Jaswinder Kaur, following which her house was raided from where the police recovered 10 gram heroin and ₹70,000 in cash.A case under sections 21, 25, 27A, 29 of NDPS Act was registered against the accused at STF police station in Phase 4, SAS Nagar.The inspector said during questioning, it came to the fore that both Manjit and his son Jagvir had earlier been booked in a drug case. “Jaswinder is the prime accused. She had been booked in cases of attempt to murder, drug smuggling, fake currency, arms act, etc. She also runs three shops of clothing, bakery and grocery store from her house,” he said.He said the accused were working together for around five years. “The accused will be questioned to know more about their network,” said the inspector.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/4-of-family-among-5-held-for-drug-smuggling-1-2kg-heroin-seized-101619036028326.html
22-04-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra tightens curbs as Covid-19 cases continue to soar||The Maharashtra government on Wednesday imposed several new restrictions including a ban on inter-city and inter-district travel and curbs on office attendance as Covid-19 cases continue to rise rapidly in the state.Attendance in government and exempted-category offices has been reduced to 15%, local train travel has been restricted to the essential sector and stricter curbs have been imposed on inter-district and city travel. The order comes into effect from 8pm from Thursday.A day after the state cabinet’s decision of imposing a full lockdown in the state, the state government issued the orders late on Wednesday. To reduce the mobility between cities and districts, travelling in public buses has been reduced to 50% of the seating capacity, while travelling in local trains has been restricted only to the people working in government offices, medical sector and those who travel for health purposes.Passengers of private buses (who are allowed to travel) will have to quarantine themselves at home for 14 days after they reach their destination. Bus operators will have to stamp the passengers’ hands to indicate they are supposed to stay at home.Weddings can take place with 25 persons in attendance in a single hall. The ceremony shall not extend beyond two hours and violation of the rule will attract a fine of ₹50,000, the order said. Medical professionals and those requiring immediate medical attention and disabled people can use public transport services during the period. Disabled persons can be accompanied by another person.The local disaster management authority can obtain information of passengers of long distance travel and stamp them with “home quarantine” tag.The decision of lockdown was taken by the state cabinet on Tuesday, amid the projection by the health department of active cases rising over 1.1 million by May 2. The department expressed concerned that the health machinery will not be able to bear the burden as over 80% of it is already under use. The shortage of oxygen and anti-viral drugs such as remdesivir was another concern, after which the ministers insisted for a complete lockdown.State health minister Rajesh Tope said earlier in the day that except public transport and essential commodities, everything else will be shut down. “Though we are not calling it lockdown, it is a ‘break-the-chain’ initiative amid the rising Covid-19 cases in the state.

22-04-2021||Chandigarh||Illinois recognises April as ‘Sikh awareness month’||Indian-American Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi has entered a statement into the Congressional record to recognise April as ‘Sikh appreciation and awareness month’ in his home state of Illinois. “Madam speaker, today I rise to recognise the month of April as ‘Sikh appreciation and awareness month’ in my home state of Illinois,” Krishnamoorthi said in a statement submitted into Congressional record. This recognition, he said, is timely, given the disturbing rise in hate crimes and violent acts perpetrated against Sikh-Americans, most recently on April 15 at a Federal Express facility located in Indianapolis in which four Sikhs, including three women were killed. The first followers of the Sikh religion emigrated to the United States over 125 years ago, where they found work on farms located in California and in the lumber mills of Washington state, he said. Despite suffering persecution and discrimination, these patriotic Sikh-Americans persevered and found ways to participate in civic life, including service in the United States Army, he added.“In 1918, Sergeant Bhagat Singh Thind was the first serviceman in the history of the United States Army allowed to wear a turban as part of his military uniform. Sikh-Americans continued to proudly serve with distinction in the Second World War, Korean War, Vietnam War and in our conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq,” Krishnamoorthi said. In addition to military service, Sikh-Americans have made countless contributions to our common good, he said. “They include scientists like Dr. Narinder Singh Kapany, who is widely known as the ‘father of fibre optic technology’ and Dr Gurtej Singh Sandhu, one of the world’s most prolific inventors. They include artists and musicians like Grammy nominee Snatam Kaur Khalsa, and activist and award-winning filmmaker Valarie Kaur,” Krishnamoorthi said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/illinois-recognises-april-as-sikh-awareness-month-101619035185120.html

22-04-2021||Chandigarh||Tourist influx dries up in Kashmir as second Covid wave wreaks havoc||Tourism in Kashmir started of to a promising note at the start of the New Year. However, with the second wave wrecking havoc across the country, the tourist influx has begun to dry up. In the last two weeks, most advance bookings in hotels and houseboats across Kashmir have been cancelled, stakeholders said.Mukhtar Shah, president, Hoteliers’ Club, Gulmarg, said there had been a slew of cancellations in the wake of the second wave of the pandemic. “In the last week, a lot more people have decided to either cancel or postpone their travel. At present, we hardly have 15-20% occupancy,” Shah said, adding that the only people visiting were those who could either not cancel their tickets or were already here. Mostly tourists would make a beeline for Gulmarg, the meadow of flowers, ensconced in the Pir Panjal mountain range in the western Himalayas around 50km from Srinagar. “We received a very good response in winter. The tourism department’s promotion as well as the Khelo India games invigorated tourism,” he said.At the start of April, tourists from Gujrat and Maharashtra would start visiting the Valley. “These places are now severely affected by Covid,” he said.Tourism has nosedived in Kashmir since August 5, 2019 when the special status of the erstwhile state was revoked and restrictions imposed on movement of people and communication shut for months. The situation was further aggravated by the Covid-19 lockdown after mid-March.Farooq Kuthoo, president, Travel Agents Association of Kashmir (TAAK), said they were expecting record breaking tourist influx this year but the second wave had dampened their prospects. “This year we were expecting a bumper tourist season, which would break all records. Since December, around 1.5 lakh tourists have visited the Valley. Unfortunately, the second wave has hit the region and affected the tourist season,” he said.“Around 90-95% bookings have been cancelled. Only those people are here who are stuck in transit or who had made payments. No new queries have been made,” he said.Houseboat Owners Association general secretary Abdul Rashid said hardly any tourists can be spotted on Dal Lake anymore. “Our houseboats are empty. You will not find a single shikara with tourist,” he said. “The cancellation of bookings have affected all those associated with the tourism industry, be it shikarawalas, houseboat owners, hotelier, dhaba owners or art dealers,” he said.Despite the surging Covid numbers in Kashmir, the government had opened the Tulip Garden on the banks of Dal Lake to tourists on March 25. “The response was great but the second wave and lockdown in many states has affected the flow now. For the past week, very few tourists can be seen,” said Sofi Inam-ur-Rehman, assistant floriculture officer and in-charge of the Tulip Garden. Calls to director tourism GN Itoo yielded no response.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/tourist-influx-dries-up-in-kashmir-as-second-covid-wave-wreaks-havoc-101619034944960.html
22-04-2021||Chandigarh||Sidhu shares old posts, says one man responsible for 2015 sacrilege incidents||Former minister and Amritsar MLA Navjot Singh Sidhu on Wednesday blamed “one person” for having colluded with the culprits of 2015 sacrilege cases. In a Twitter and Facebook post, he shared his old clips of harangues on the sacrilege incidents. He, however, neither disclosed the name of the person, nor he clarified about the culprits he was talking about.The shared clips include a portion of a speech in which he had alleged “friendly match” between the Congress and the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD). “Carefully crafted collusive abetment leading to…..Hum to doobegen sanam, tumko bhi le dubenge (We will drown, but will take you along). It is not a failure of the Govt or the party, but one person who is hand in glove with the culprits,” Sidhu tweeted.In 2019, Sidhu, while addressing an election rally in Bathinda, talked of ‘friendly match” with regard to “inaction” by the state government against culprits of sacrilege incidents. His tweet is being seen ostensibly as another salvo on the Amarinder-led government in Punjab.Last week, during a press conference in Patiala, the Congress leader had attacked his own government by saying it had cheated the people of Punjab by “failing to meet the two prime demands of strict action against drug kingpins and punishment for those involved in the sacrilege of Guru Granth Sahib”.On the sacrilege issue, Sidhu had said that the investigation was botched up since 2015. “Why has the government failed to name and nail the guilty? On whose directions did the policemen open fire on protesters? Why are their names not mentioned in the FIR? It’s evident from the Justice Ranjit Singh Commission report that the then chief minister had spoken to the then police chief at midnight, hours before the firing on protesting Sikhs was undertaken. The report was tabled in the House, debated and a resolution was passed to punish the guilty, but no concrete action has been taken. Who is responsible?” he had said, asking the government to make the report of the sacrilege probe public.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sidhu-shares-old-posts-says-one-man-responsible-for-2015-sacrilege-incidents-101619034885499.html
22-04-2021||Chandigarh||2nd wave of Covid deals blow to wedding business, tourism in Himachal||A day after the government imposed fresh restrictions on social gatherings, around 45% to 80% weddings have been postponed or cancelled, which has dealt a blow to the wedding industry. The government has now reduced the capacity for both indoor and outdoor guests at weddings and funerals to 50. Hotel Holiday Home manager Nand Lal Sharma says, “Banquets halls at the hotel had been booked solid until mid-May. However, we were asked to cancel 20 such events yesterday alone. People have deferred the dates.”Ravinder Sandhu, manager, Hotel Pinewood, which is 61km from Chandigarh on the Kalka-Shimla highway, agrees, “Many people from the tricity — Chandigarh, Mohali, and Panchkula — had booked our hotel after the Punjab government limited the number of guests at weddings. Now, they have cancelled or postponed their bookings.” “We had booked nine weddings after April 23. However, now that the government has capped the numbers we have lost avenues to earn,” said Sanjay Madan, proprietor, East Bourne Hotel. Shimla Hoteliers and Restaurateurs Association president Sanjay Sood said, “At a time when the pandemic-hit tourism industry was showing signs of revival, the restrictions have again dealt a blow to the hotel industry. Many hotels have lost bookings.” In Dharamshala, too, catering companies and hotels fear that they may lose business. Vijay Inder Karan, a Dharamshala-based hotelier ,said, “We have two or three wedding bookings. We have asked them to strictly adhere to the guest limit of 50 people.” Surge in cases and the slew of restrictions being announced one after the other have brought the tourism industry to a grinding halt in Himachal. The government had issued an advisory for tourists from heavy caseloads states asking them to bring negative Covid reports not older than 72 hours with them. “The financial health of the tourism industry and its stakeholders is already in a bad shape due to complete closure of tourism units for seven to eight months last year. The industry was slowly heading towards revival due to free-flow of tourists,” said MK Seth, president, Himachal Pradesh Tourism Stake holder Association . “The stakeholders were at least generating some revenue to meet their expenses.However, the second wave has broken the back bone of tourism industry in Himachal,” he said adding that the state receives most tourists between March and mid-July, and that too from Gujrat and Maharashtra, and West Bengal. The weekend crowd also mostly comprises visitors from Punjab, Haryana, Delhi, Chandigarh and Uttarakhand, most of which feature in the list of high caseload states. “It has become difficult for the stakeholders to keep their units running,” says Seth. Similarly, taxi operators are also finding it difficult to make ends meet. “I purchased a new car after raising a loan from the bank two years ago, but lockdown was imposed last year and prospects of earning seem bleak this year too. I have no option but to sell the car,” says Ravinder Kumar , 25, a taxi operator .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/2nd-wave-of-covid-deals-blow-to-wedding-business-tourism-in-himachal-101619034766297.html

The victim, Ranjit Singh, 35, was found dead on April 14. Police claimed the accused, Gagandeep Kaur, 30, and Raghvir Singh, 27, a cousin of the victim, confessed to the crime after their arrest on Wednesday.Sharing details, Jodhan station house officer (SHO) Amritpal Singh, who is the investigating officer, said the case was registered on complaint of the victim’s father Sukhdev Singh.He told the police that his son had got married to Gagandeep around 10 years ago and the couple has three daughters, aged 9, 7 and 4. However, due to strained relations, the couple had started living separately. The complainant said that he came to know that his nephew Raghvir had visited the house a day before his son was found dead. It also came to the fore that Raghvir and Gagandeep Kaur were in an illicit relationship. “When I questioned Gagandeep about the matter, she was not able to give a proper response and on the intervening night of April 16 and 17, she fled, leaving her daughters home,” said the victim’s father. “Following their arrest, the accused revealed that they had served dinner laced with poison to the victim and strangulated him after he lost consciousness,” the investigating officer said. A case under Section 302 (murder), 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of the Indian Penal Code has been registered against the two accused.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/week-after-ludhiana-man-s-mysterious-death-wife-her-aide-held-for-murder-101619034765029.html
22-04-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra imposes full lockdown from today||The Maharashtra government imposed a full lockdown, almost one on the lines of the one that was in place last year, amid the rapid rise in Covid-19 cases.From reducing attendance in government and exempted-category offices to 15%, local train travel has been restricted to essential sector and stricter curbs have been imposed on interdistrict/city travel. The order comes into effect from 8pm on Thursday. This would mean, people can’t step out unless for medical reasons or to buy essential commodities (between 7am and 11am) or if they are working in essential sector. Majority of restrictions have already been announced on Tuesday. A day after the state cabinet’s decision of imposing a full lockdown in the state, the state government issued an SOP late on Thursday. To reduce the mobility between cities and districts, travelling in public buses has been reduced to 50% of their sitting capacity, while the travelling in local trains has been restricted only to the people working in government offices, medical sector and ones who are travelling for health purposes. The inter-district/city travel has been made strict by making 14 days quarantine and stamping their hands mandatory. The public transport buses, including BEST in Mumbai, will ply for all, but at 50% of the sitting capacity. The passengers travelling inter-city/district in public transport buses will have to mandatorily undergo the quarantine period of 14 days, while a rapid antigen test on them at alighting point can be considered by local authorities, the order has said. The decision of lockdown was taken by the state cabinet on Tuesday, amid the projection by the health department of active cases rising over 1.1 million cases by May 2. The department had expressed concerned that the health machinery will not be able to bear the burden as over 80% of it has already under use. The shortage of oxygen and anti-viral drug such as Remdesivir was another concern expressed, after which all the state cabinet ministers insisted for the complete lockdown. The wedding ceremony, which is proved to be the super-spreader event in the past, has been allowed in the presence of only 25 attendees. The ceremony has to be completed in two hours, while the flouting of the condition may attract the fine of Rs50,000 to the family and action against the operator by shutting down the facility till the end of the pandemic. “The offices from exempted category, including banks, mediclaim, insurance sector, too, will have to reduce the attendance to 15% from existing permission of 50%. However the offices dealing in essential services including hospitals, clinics, pharmaceutical companies, posts, ports, petrol pumps, petroleum companies, e-commerce companies etc can operate at 50% capacity,” the order issued by chief secretary Sitaram Kunte said. The private offices have already been directed to switch to work-from-home (WFH) mode. The private passenger vehicles, except buses, have been allowed only for essential and emergency services or for valid reasons at 50% of their sitting capacity. The inter-district travel of such vehicles, too, has been restricted only for essential and emergency services. The private buses are allowed to ply intra and inter-city/district at 50% of their sitting capacity. “The passengers travelling in such buses will have to go through a 14-day quarantine. A rapid antigen test at the alighting point can be considered by local authorities. The passengers will be stamped for ascertaining the quarantine period. Flouting of rules will attract a fine of Rs10,000,” the order has stated. State health minister Rajesh Tope said earlier in the day, which except public transport and essential commodities, everything else will be shut down. “Railways and bus services will not be shut down, under the new curbs expected to be announced soon. Though we are not calling it lockdown, it is a ‘break-the-chain’ initiative amid the rising Covid-19 cases in the state. We have been utilising 80-90% of our facilities in the health infrastructure, including beds, oxygen, manpower and it cannot bear more load. Against the backdrop of it, all the cabinet ministers insisted on complete lockdown. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray will announce it soon,” he said. The minister said that although prime minister Narendra Modi has said that the lockdown should be the last resort, the state government has no other option, but to go for it amid pressure on the infrastructure. Tope said that there would not be complete ban on inter-district travel.“The inter-district travel will be allowed only for essential and emergency services. Police administration will ensure at the borders that outsiders are not entering the district without a valid reason. The entry will be given with valid prior permission. We, however, do not want to impose complete ban on an inter-district travel,” said the minister.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-imposes-full-lockdown-from-today-101619034644371.html
22-04-2021||Chandigarh||Why Punjab’s wheat procurement process is in doldrums this time||The ongoing wheat procurement in Punjab has been chaotic, exposing Capt Amarinder government to an unprecedented situation at a time when assembly polls are less than a year away. The government is on the back foot, finding it tough to defend its position. All this gives room to the opposition parties —SAD and AAP — to win political brownie points over the Congress. HT takes a 360-degree look to find out why wheat procurement is tardy this time. Farmers not adhering to token system As against expectations of the mandi board for 40 lakh tonne wheat arrival in the mandis by April 20, in proportion to 9.87 lakh passes issued to the farmers, the arrivals actually touched 59 lakh tonne, leading to a glut. “The farmers are not going by the turn system, they are trying to push their way as if they have pressed a panic button and are unloading their produce in mandis,” said a senior officer of state food and civil supplies department. Last two procurements were smooth because mandi board was able to successfully execute the token system, which flopped this time. 130 lakh tonne wheat is expected to be procured this season. Shortage of gunny bags State’s food and civil supplies is facing acute shortage of gunny bags. Roughly 5.42 lakh bales (each bale has 500 bags) are required this time and there is a shortage of 68,000 bales (3.4 crore bags). The shortage is delaying lifting, hence contributing to the glut. After nod from the Centre, the state department has allowed use of one-time used bags at a cost of ₹41.9 per bag. The arhtiyas and owners of rice shelling mills are offering one-time used bags for procurement. “The entire operation of collecting these bags and distributing them in the mandis takes time for which everyone needs to have patience,” said a food department officer. Arhtiyas not cooperating For the first time in 65 years since assured procurement began, the role of arhtiyas was restricted for the first time in the current procurement season. The Centre mandated direct benefit transfer (DBT) of minimum support price directly in farmers’ bank accounts bypassing the arhtiyas. Though state government made some changes in the PFMS system used in making payments to farmers, but they have no control over the payment part. “Previously they used to perform some functions on their own, such as arrangements of gunny bags in case of shortage and making payment to the farmers in case of delay from the Centre. But they are not coming forward this time,” said a mandi board officer. “We are down morally, but we are cooperating,” said VK Kalra, president of arhtiyas’ association. Labour shortage Due to pandemic, there is shortage of labour. The entire logistics in the procurement process such as cleaning of grain, weighing, filing, stitching and transportation is done by labour and the shortage has slowed down the entire process. “The harvest is highly mechanised as 17,500 harvest machines are put to use in 12,500 villages across state and it takes only a week to 10 days. But procurement and lifting can’t be done at the same pace, leading to pile-up in mandis,” said director food and civil supplies Ravi Bhagat. Arrivals peaked in a week March being comparatively warmer this year, wheat grain matured early leading to fast-paced harvesting even as procurement was delayed by 10 days this time. “We touched peak arrivals within nine days with 10 lakh tone of produce reaching the mandis. Now, it has come down as weather conditions have changed,” Bhagat added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/why-punjab-s-wheat-procurement-process-is-in-doldrums-this-time-101619034526194.html
22-04-2021||Chandigarh||IMA opposes disparity in prices of Covid vaccine||The Indian Medical Association (IMA) has have opposed the disparity in the rates of Covid vaccines being offered to private hospitals.Dr Navjot Dhayia, national vice-president of the Indian Medical Association (IMA) said the Serum Institute of India (SII) has fixed the price of Covishield vaccine at ₹600 per dose for private hospitals and ₹400 per jab for government hospitals, whereas the centre will get the same for ₹150.Dahyia termed it as discrimination with private doctors. He said that at a time when the government was promoting slogans such as “one nation, one tax”, why private hospitals are being discriminated against. The prices should be the same for government and private hospitals, said Dahyia.Dr GS Grewal, former president of Punjab Medical Council (PMC) and Dr Arun Mitra, former chairman, Ethical Committee of PMC, said the Prime Minister had some time back stated that all the countrymen will be given vaccines free of cost. “But now, the government is running away from its responsibility. Right from the day one, the government is not serious about controlling the pandemic. The disparity in prices has exposed the slogan of ‘one India one Mandi and one India one ration card,” said Dr Grewal.Dr Gaurav Sachdeva, former vice-president of IMA (Ludhiana chapter) said that the prices of vaccines will show the private doctors in a bad light.“Already, there is a perception that private hospitals charge a premium on health services. Generally, people are not aware about the price difference of the vaccine. And when the private hospital will charge more, the public will accuse them of fleecing which sends a wrong message,” said Dr Sachdeva.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ima-opposes-disparity-in-prices-of-covid-vaccine-101619034285031.html

22-04-2021||Chandigarh||Bathinda sees seven-fold jump in Covid cases in a month||As another 271 Covid-19 cases were reported in Bathinda on Wednesday, the district has seen more than a seven-fold rise in the infections in a month.District officials said that number of active cases is likely to be much higher as a large number of people, particularly from the rural belt, are frequently participating in farmer protests in Punjab and Delhi borders. They also see a possible link of huge gathering at the annual Baisakhi mela in Talwandi Sabo town of the district as 2,119 Covid cases have reported in the last one week since April 15. According to the official data, on March 21, the number of active cases in Bathinda was 359 and total of 261 deaths were reported by then. There were 11,912 Covid positive cases till March 21. However, after one month, the number of active Covid patients has now reached 2,746. Almost two deaths were reported every day in the last one-month period in Bathinda.The district has the highest number of positive cases and Covid deaths among the districts of south Malwa.District Covid nodal officer Dr Ramandeep Singla said besides farmer protests and rallies, the Baisakhi mela that was held between April 11 and 14 at Talwandi Sabo was an example of a grave violation of pandemic guidelines.“Thousands of people visited the annual mela at Talwandi. There was absolutely no social distancing and hardly anyone was using face mask. Such unregulated events may lead to a chaotic medical situation. Though five-day home quarantine for those visiting religious or other large gatherings is in place, it is impossible to implement in the absence of community participation,” said Singla.Senior superintendent of police (SSP) BS Virk admitted gross violations of Covid norms during the four-day Baisakhi mela and rally organised by Bhartiya Kisan Union (Ekta Ugrhana) at Talwandi on April 13 but no FIR was lodged against violators.“We registered a daily diary report (DDR) about the violations,” said SSP said. “Population in the urban areas is more responsive to testing and vaccination but the same spirit lacks in the villages. Community leaders should play an important role here as the Covid situation is very alarming and the health department could give results only if people extend proactive support,” said civil surgeon Dr TS Dhillon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/bathinda-sees-seven-fold-jump-in-covid-cases-in-a-month-101619034044882.html
22-04-2021||Mumbai||Home Covid vaccine not an option: UoI affidavit to Bombay HC||The ministry of health and family welfare (MoHFW) told the Bombay high court (HC) that door-to-door vaccination is not feasible, as it would be difficult to ensure that the vaccine is maintained at the optimal temperature required and further, help a patient in case of in Adverse Event Following Immunization (AEFI). The detailed affidavit filed by under secretary Satyendra Singh on Tuesday cited five reasons for why such a vaccination policy does not exist.“In case of any AEFI, case management may not be proper and there will be delay in reaching health facility; Challenges in maintaining protocol of observation of beneficiary for 30 minutes after vaccination; The vaccine will be place in and out of Vaccine Carrier for each vaccination thereby increasing chances of contamination and exposure beyond recommended temperature which could affect vaccine efficacy and cause AEFI which will be detrimental to vaccine confidence and programme performance; High vaccine wastage due to increased time going from door to door taking more time for reaching out to each beneficiary; Following protocols for physical distancing and infection prevention and control may not be possible during door to door campaign,” it stated.Two advocates, Dhruti Kapadia and Kunal Tiwari, had filed a Public Interest Litigation on April 7 seeking that the vaccination of senior citizens above 75 years, differently abled and those who are bed-ridden should be carried out in their homes. The PIL stated that since the vaccination drive, which began on January 16, many politicians had got the vaccine at home. However, on April 9, the state of Maharashtra opposed the plea on the grounds that as per vaccination protocols issued by the National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration, which guides on all aspects of the vaccination drive, did not have any mention regarding door-to-door vaccination. Purnima Kantharia, representing the state, submitted that supervision is a must after vaccination and the doctors have to observe how the body reacts to the jab. The lawyer representing the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation submitted that as per guidelines, three rooms including waiting room, vaccination room and observation room are required in any vaccination centre. The lawyer submitted that as a result of this vaccination had to be carried out close to an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) facility in case of any emergency. A bench comprising chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni of the Bombay HC sought a response from the MoHFW, and also asked whether a policy for door-to-door vaccination could be put in place by the Centre. In an exhaustive affidavit filed on Tuesday, the Centre said that it was not mandatory to have an ICU facility for administering the Covid-19 vaccines. The affidavit stated that as the vaccine would be constantly removed from the carrier for each shot to be administered, it would be difficult to maintain the correct temperature needed for their storage, and the chance of contamination and exposure to temperatures that are beyond what is recommended would affect vaccine efficacy and may cause Adverse event Following Immunization (AEFI). Singh also stated that in case of an AEFI in door-to-door vaccination, it may not always be possible to take a patient to a health facility on time, and that the mandatory observation for at least 30 minutes after vaccination, would not be possible at home. The affidavit also states that after receiving requests from several state governments, more vaccination centres had been approved for special consideration of senior citizens. The case is scheduled to be heard on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/home-covid-vaccine-not-an-option-uoi-affidavit-to-bombay-hc-101619033924285.html
22-04-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Indrani Mukerjea, 38 inmates of Byculla jail test positive for Covid-19||Indrani Mukerjea, prime accused in Sheena Bora murder case, and 38 other inmates of the Byculla women’s jail tested positive for Covid-19 and were moved to a Covid care centre in Byculla for treatment, senior prison officials said on Wednesday.This comes in the wake of an outbreak in the state’s 44 prisons, which have seen the number of active Covid jump from 284 to 385 (of which 285 are prisoners) in the week between April 14 and 21. The number of active patients in the state prisons was 42 on March 3. The jail official quoted above said that a random anti-gen test of the prisoners revealed 39 positive cases on Tuesday night, including Mukerjea, the former chief executive officer of INX Media, who was arrested in August 2015. Mukerjea was arrested after her driver, arrested under the Arms Act, accused his employer of killing Sheena Bora, Mukerjea’s daughter, three years earlier. Peter Mukerjea was also arrested later in this case. The Central Bureau of Investigation told the court that he was the “silent killer” in this case. According to the prosecution, Indrani had been against the relationship between Sheena, Indrani’s daughter from a previous marriage, and Rahul, Peter’ son from a previous marriage. Last June saw a major outbreak in Arthur Road Central prison when over 180 prisoners tested positive for Covid-19. The Byculla district prison has a capacity of 462 prisoners (262 women and 200 men) but houses 306 women and 203 men. Some women prisoners also have children living with them.The authorities have conducted 59,036 Covid tests so far. “Since April 2020 a total of 3,262 prisoners have tested positive for Covid and nine have succumbed to the infectious disease. Yerwada, Kolahapur and Thane prisons have maximum active Covid positive prisoners,” the jail official said.In view of the surge in cases of Covid infection among prisoners and jail staffs across Maharashtra prisons, the jail authorities have started setting up 36 temporary prisons (Covid Centres for prisoners) across the state. “These temporary prisons (mostly educational institutes which are shut due to lockdown) were discontinued last year as the Covid cases had gone down drastically; 14 temporary prions (Covid Centres) have already started while requests have been made to local authorities for 22 others,” Sunil Ramanand, additional director general (prisons), said. Prison officials also said that the principal reason for spread of the virus in jails is overcrowding as lower courts have not released prisoners on bail across the state. The prison authority also wants the quarterly (three-monthly) meeting of district-wise Under-Trial Review Committees, which are headed by a Sessions Judge, to be conducted weekly to enable the regular review of de-congestion exercise at the prisons.Since March 25, 2020, 10,788 prisoners have been released to reduce overcrowding in the prisons in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. However, state prisons continue to remain highly overcrowded. At present, they have 34,943 prisoners against the capacity of 24,000 prisoners.The prison authority also taking efforts to prevent the spread of virus among its jail staffs. So far 3982 tests have been conducted on staffs following which 759 detected positive for Covid-19. Among these, eight jail staffers died. At present state prisons have 102 active Covid cases among staff members.The first case of Covid-19 was reported in Byculla jail on May 31, 2020.Another prison official requesting anonymity said that all the precautionary measures which came into effect during the peak of the pandemic last year have been put in place again. This also includes ensuring no mulaqats (visits of prisoner’s relatives to jail to meet prisoners).The prison authorities have also been conducting random testing not only of prisoners but also of the staff members working in various prisons throughout the state. No new inmate is being admitted without a Covid tests since last May. Taking cognizance of the April 16 report of Hindustan Times the Bombay High Court initiated a suo motu public interest litigation and directed authorities to compulsorily subject prisoners to RT-PCR tests and a vaccination shot 24-hours prior to being admitted to the prison. The High Court is likely to pass more orders in this regard on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-indrani-mukerjea-38-inmates-of-byculla-jail-test-positive-for-covid19-101619033684259.html
22-04-2021||Mumbai||At 568, Maharashtra sees highest single-day deaths||Maharashtra on Wednesday reported its highest single-day toll of 568 since the Covid-19 pandemic, taking the toll to 61,911. It also added 67,468 fresh Covid-19 cases to push its tally over four million-mark to 4,027,827. The active case load in Maharashtra is now at a touching distance of 700,000 at 695,747.Mumbai, meanwhile, added 7,654 fresh infections to go over the 600,000-mark on Wednesday. The city, so far, has 601,713 confirmed cases, while the active case count in Mumbai climbed to 83,450. Mumbai added 62 deaths, taking its toll to 12,508.Maharashtra, which is slated to go under a strict lockdown from Thursday evening, is projected to add another 400,000 active cases in the next 11 days. According to presentation on the Covid-19 situation given to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Tuesday, the state’s active case count will touch 1,094,996 by May 2. The state aims to arrest the rise in cases by introducing a complete lockdown. Of the nearly 1.1 million active cases, 300,000 cases are expected to be from Mumbai and its surrounding districts of Thane, Palghar and Raigad.A health department official said the state is expected to face a shortage of hospital beds, unless the chain of transmission is broken through a lockdown. “Our projections had showed us that we would have an active caseload of 1.1 million by the end of this month. Even more worrying was the shortage of all types of beds across the state, including major cities like Mumbai, Pune, Nagpur,” the official said. As per the presentation, barring Amravati, Jalgaon and Kolhapur districts, Maharashtra is projected to face a severe shortage of hospital beds. Mumbai, which is projected to have an active caseload of 146,065 people, will be short of 6,433 oxygenated beds, 1,477 ICU beds and 121 ventilator beds. Similarly, Pune’s active caseload is projected to touch 185,162. It is projected to have a shortfall of 34,528 isolation beds, 13,118 oxygenated beds, 2,240 ICU beds, and 518 ventilator beds.Fourteen of the 35 districts in Maharashtra have a high positivity rate on a week-on-week basis, as per the presentation of the state health department. The positivity rate in these 14 districts is higher than the state’s overall positivity rate of 16.36%. Osmanabad topped the districts with a high positivity rate at 39.25%, followed by Parbhani and Hingoli at 36.78% and 36.7%, respectively. Pune district had a positivity rate of 30.43%, while Thane district had a positivity rate of 30.67%.Since April 14, Maharashtra has added 3,107 deaths and the senior health department officials attributed the jump in fatalities to late admission to hospital. They, however, dismissed shortage of oxygen and remdesivir as contributors to deaths. “Late arrivals continue to be the main factors. Besides, the sheer number of infections, we are bound to get high number of deaths. We do not think oxygen shortage or drug shortage is a factor,” said a health department official, who did not wish to be named.Dr Subhash Salunkhe, former director general of health services in the state and advisor to the state on Covid-19, said, “With more and more people getting infected, we will see a high number of patients land up in hospital. Roughly 10% of the cases are clinical. Late arrivals make it difficult for doctors to save the person. There could be some stray cases of deaths due to oxygen shortage but it is not the main factor.”He added that the case fatality rate in the state is under control. The CFR stood at 1.54% on Wednesday. “Had the CFR shown an upward graph we would have been in a really bad position.”Of the 568 deaths reported on Wednesday, 303 occurred in the past 48 hours and 160 in the past week. The remaining 105 deaths are from the period before past week. Area in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region cumulatively reported 88 fatalities in the past 24 hours. Pune district saw 36 deaths, while Nashik and Ahmednagar reported 29 deaths each. Nagpur district added 41 deaths, Bhandara 23 and Nandurbad 24. Osmanabad and Beed districts added 17 and 12 deaths, respectively.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/at-568-maharashtra-sees-highest-single-day-deaths-101619033624326.html
22-04-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab hits new peak with 4,970 fresh cases||Punjab on Wednesday reported another record spike of 4970 Covid cases, breaking the previous high of 4957 infections witnessed on April 18.With 69 more fatalities, the death toll in the state climbed to 8,114, according to a bulletin released by the state government. A total of 3,14,269 people have been infected by the virus in the state so far.Maximum 10 deaths were reported from Amritsar, seven each from Ludhiana and Ferozepur, six in Patiala and five in Hoshiarpur. According to the bulletin, maximum 879 cases were registered in Ludhiana, followed by 692 in Mohali Nagar, 462 in Patiala, 422 in Jalandhar, 290 in Amritsar, 267 in Bathinda, 221 in Hoshiarpur, 182 in Sangrur, 166 in Faridkot, 164 in Gurdaspur, 162 in Kapurthala, 148 in Ferozepur, 135 in Rupnagar, 124 in Pathankot, 126 in Muktsar, 105 in Moga, 110 in Fazilka, 51 in Fatehgarh Sahib, 32 in Barnala, 50 in SBS Nagar and 41 in Tarn Taran.SAD demands white paper on Covid spendsThe Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) on Monday asked the Congress government to present a white paper to disclose how it used ₹1,000 crore to upgrade hospital infrastructure in the state to fight the Covid-19 pandemic “when nothing had been done on the ground”. Terming the ₹1,000 crore spend on fighting Covid as a colossal scam, former minister Sikander Singh Maluka demanded a central probe into the claim by an impartial agency, saying even as thousands were dying due to the sheer apathy of the Congress government, the latter was making bogus claims. In a statement, he said an urgent probe was needed to detect and punish those responsible for the multi-hundred crore scam as well as to put a lid on further corruption so that State money could be spent on patient welfare. Asking how the government could even make these claims, Maluka said: “There is no visible change in the hospital infrastructure. Districts like Mohali and Rupnagar do not even have dedicated Covid hospitals. New ICU facilities have been created only in two district hospitals. There is a shortage of life saving injections like toclizumab and Itolizumab, besides remedisvir. Patients are not getting access to ventilators. Even ventilators provided by the central government were left unpacked for months because of lack of staff to operate them.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-hits-new-peak-with-4-970-fresh-cases-101619033565640.html
22-04-2021||Mumbai||SSC exams cancelled: Real test for Maharashtra board now||In the absence of a standardised mechanism to assess the year-round performance of state board students, the Maharashtra government’s decision to cancel the senior secondary certificate (SSC) Class 10 exams has thrown up challenges for the state education department. The cancellations On April 15, CBSE cancelled Class 10 exams and postponed Class 12 exams across the country. Students of Class 10 will be marked on the basis of objective criteria to be developed by the board. The criteria for marking students are yet to be declared. On April 12, the state had postponed HSC exams to the end of May and SSC exams to June, following which the state had written to CBSE and ICSE officials requesting postponement of board exams. However, following CBSE’s decision and a similar decision from ICSE, IGCSE and IB, there was growing pressure from students and parents to cancel exams to ensure equivalence across boards, key at the time of admissions to colleges. On Tuesday, Class 10 exams were cancelled by the state government. The challenges While state education minister Varsha Gaikwad announced that students of Class 10 will be marked on the basis of internal assessments, it seems like a herculean task for a board with over 17 lakh students across different geographical and social backgrounds appearing for the exams every year. Schools said while they were awaiting guidelines, they were unsure about the efficacy of internal assessments as they were conducted at the school level and their format and frequency varied in each school. Jagdish Indalkar, principal, KVK School, Ghatkopar, said while the school has conducted prelim exams, some students did not write them. “Some students have not submitted any of the assignments we had asked them to and did not even appear for the exams. Now, if internal assessments have to be considered, we will have to give another chance to such students. Besides, students wrote their prelims only for practice and did not know that these marks are likely to be considered in the future. Hence, we cannot say that these marks indicate the real potential of a child,” he added. Schools said in the absence of government guidelines on internal assessments throughout the year, they continued conducting short tests, prelims etc. as per their understanding and requirement. “Some conducted a single prelim, while others took three to four exams. Those who could afford conducted exams using high-end proctoring software, while those who could not, used Google forms, email and other such means. Where is the consistency? How can two students from two different schools who are evaluated on completely different criteria compete for a college seat with their marks? This will be unfair,” said a teacher from a school in the city’s eastern suburbs. How others do it The heads of CBSE and ICSE boards said both the boards have a process for internal assessments and have data for it. “We have a meeting with the board in a few days and will wait for instructions to send data. We have conducted year-round assessments,” said an ICSE board principal. CBSE, too, has four-five assessments throughout the year and schools have sent the data to the board on Tuesday. Vasant Kalpande, former chairperson of the state board, said we need to understand the differences between students of the state board and those from other boards. “These schools have a majority of students from middle- and high-income groups and many schools are in towns and cities with basic online infrastructure already in place. For the state board, there are many challenges because there is the rural-urban gap and then a large number of students are also first-generation learners. Thus, the decision-making process here is likely to be more complex,” he added. While a majority of schools in the state did not conduct any internal assessments for Class 10, some schools in parts of the state where schools had reopened for a few months before the second wave, physical exams were conducted for Class 9 and 10. This has raised concerns over equivalence of marks as some students wrote physical exams while others did not. “We held our practice exams for students and almost all attended. We prepared them for 2-3 months and then took exams. Hence it was a very well-planned exercise here,” said Balu Bhoyar, principal, Karamveer Vidyalaya in Chandrapur. The state education department allowed schools in the state to reopen for Classes 9 to 12 from November 23, 2020 and for Classes 5 to 8 from January 27, 2021. Many schools closed in March and April owing to the rising Covid-19 cases. On Tuesday, state education minister Varsha Gaikwad held a meeting with experts and officials of the education department. “Several ideas and possibilities were discussed and explored. We are trying to get feedback on them from various stakeholders and experts,” said a senior educationist who was present at the meeting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/ssc-exams-cancelled-real-test-for-maharashtra-board-now-101619033564285.html
22-04-2021||Mumbai||Thane: Police enforces lockdown, shuts shops after 11am||With curbs on timings for shops selling essential goods, the Thane Police forcefully closed shops in Thane markets on Wednesday afternoon. Markets across the city wore a deserted look since afternoon as all shops remained closed. Police officers from each police station closed the shops in their jurisdiction after 11am. Action was taken in popular markets of Jambli Naka, Naupada and Ghodbunder along with those in Kalyan and Dombivli. As per state guidelines, grocery shops, dairy shops, fruits and vegetable shops and vendors, meat shops, bakery shops and all other essential shops can function only between 7am and 11am every day. A senior police officer from Thane said, “We will ensure that these curbs are strictly followed. Our teams will be patrolling through the day to take action against shops found flouting these directives.” A grocery shop owner from Jambli Naka, Jitesh Gala, said, “We used to start our shop around 9am. But as per new rules, we have to start it at 7am and close at 11am. During this time, very few people shop for groceries. Most of them come to shop around 10am. The situation was same today, but we asked them to form a line. The timing is too short and not suitable for business.” Jagannath Gupta, a dairy shop owner from Naupada, said, “Our milk business is not affected, but the business of milk products such as cheese and paneer is hit as we cannot produce it in large quantities like earlier. It will not be sold in the four hours allotted to us.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/thane-police-enforces-lockdown-shuts-shops-after-11am-101619033445541.html
22-04-2021||Mumbai||FYJC admissions: Maharashtra government discusses entrance exams, increasing seats||After the state government cancelled Class 10 - SSC exams on Tuesday, it is now mulling various options for conducting first-year junior college (FYJC) admissions in a free and fair manner. State education minister Varsha Gaikwad on Wednesday held a meeting with education experts and officials of the education department, in which, several possible ways of conducting FYJC admission were discussed. Some options discussed included holding entrance exams for junior college admissions, increasing the number of seats at prominent junior colleges and calculating the performance of students for Class 10 based on their marks for two-three years. “Several options were discussed. There was an opinion that since there will be no exams, a fair mechanism for admissions to colleges is needed. One of the ideas was conducting entrance exams in junior colleges where there is competition and more takers than seats. Sought after colleges are numerically smaller. In other colleges, admissions can be given to students easily as there is no fight for seats,” said an expert present at the meeting. Every year, admissions to FYJC begin after the results of board exams are declared. While SSC students join junior colleges in the state, many from CBSE, ICSE, IB and other boards apply for seats too. In the state, admissions are conducted online in six regions- Mumbai, Pune, Pimpri Chinchwad, Nashik, Nagpur, Aurangabad and Amravati. In other parts of the state, offline admissions are held at the college level. Experts are now worried that not having SSC exams might have long term repercussions on future careers of students. “We are worried that this batch should not be termed as Covid batch because they did not have any exams. Similarly, students need to be realistically assessed and not having exams will make the task difficult for the state board. These students have studied all year and subjecting them to another uncertain format for admissions will be unfair,” said Basanti Roy, former secretary of the Mumbai divisional board. “We already have a surge in the cut-offs every year. Now with internal assessments, we are worried that there might be too many high scorers and very few seats in comparison,” said the principal of a city-based junior college. Possible scenarios for admission-Calculation of average marks of students from their scores of the last 2-3 years. Students will then be given cumulative scores which will be considered for admissions-Pre-admission entrance tests to be conducted by junior colleges or centrally by the education department.

22-04-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Dharavi reports fewer cases than Dadar, Mahim||Since the beginning of 2021 including the second wave of Covid-19 outbreak in Maharshtra that began mid-February, Dharavi has contributed 24.3% of Covid cases in its administrative ward area, which is considerably less than neighbouring areas of Dadar (36.5%) and Mahim (39.1%). This year, Dharavi has reported a total of 2,220 cases till April 20, Dadar reported 3,341 cases, and Mahim 3,574 cases. Dharavi has contributed to 0.7% of Mumbai’s total cases reported during this time.In the beginning of the pandemic last year, Dharavi was a major hot spot of Covid-19 cases, with the highest single-day spike reported at 94 on April 8. G-North ward, with jurisdiction over these areas, has reported a total of 22,238 Covid-19 cases so far since the beginning of the pandemic, with a doubling rate of 59 days and growth rate of 1.22%. Dharavi has contributed 5,740 of these cases till April 20, with a doubling rate of 90 days and average growth rate of 0.89%. On the other hand, so far Dadar has reported a total of 8,016 cases, and Mahim 8,019.The trend of Dadar and Mahim, characterised by residential buildings, reporting more cases than Dharavi is in line with the general trend seen during the second wave, where more number of cases are being reported from residential buildings than from slums and chawls. As of Wednesday, there are 114 containment zones in slums and chawls, and 1,198 sealed buildings across the city.Kiran Dighavkar, assistant commissioner of G-North ward, said, “The overall trend of the second wave is seen in Dharavi as well. But in January and February, when we noticed cases in Dharavi were increasing even slightly, we immediately took stringent preventive measures to ensure a second outbreak is mitigated. We started mobile testing vans, fever clinics, tracing high-risk contacts. We were able to control the cases in Dharavi to an extent.”On Wednesday, Dharavi reported 30 new Covid-19 cases. Presently, there are 930 active cases in Dharavi, 2,168 in Dadar, and 2,353 in Mahim. In G-North ward, beneficiaries have received a total of 8,715 vaccine doses, which includes first and second dose for some beneficiaries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-dharavi-reports-fewer-cases-than-dadar-mahim-101619033444273.html
22-04-2021||Chandigarh||Contact tracing remains poor in Punjab amid second Covid wave||At a time when Punjab is battling the second wave of the pandemic, the state health department is struggling to break the Covid-19 transmission chain by tracing all the contacts of the positive patients.Contact tracing—the practice of identifying all those who had come in contact with a positive patient—is one of the major Covid-19 control methods. However, besides treatment and testing, Punjab is also lacking in maintaining the contact tracing of every Covid-19 patient.According to the Union government norms, at least 30 persons should be tested after every Covid-19 patient but the state health department is managing to trace only 17 people per patient. In many districts, the contact tracing numbers are as low as 5-8 contacts per positive patient.“When the health teams try to ask the patients about their contacts, they start misbehaving. People are reluctant to reveal the names of their family members and friends as they think the health department will forcibly take them to hospital and will get them tested. Despite the hurdles, we are tracing 10-15 people per patient,” said Patiala civil surgeon Dr Satinder Singh. According to the health department data, only 4-5 people were being traced in Punjab against every positive patient, against the target of 10, during the infection spike in September last year.An Amritsar-based health official, on the condition of anonymity, said: “The district is recording over 300 fresh cases daily, but the health department teams are only testing family members who are living in the same house. The patients are not being asked about their visits and the gathering they had attended before catching the virus.”“As people do not reveal their contacts, special teams have been constituted with the officials of district administration and police to improve the situation. The teams will ask positive patients to give names of all those persons who came in his or her contact in the last few days. We are tracing 15 people after every positive patient,” said Amritsar civil surgeon Dr Charanjit Singh.Focus on treatment, testingState nodal officer for Covid-19 Dr Rajesh Bhaskar said: “At present, we are tracing 17 people after every positive patient but we are trying to achieve our target of at least 20 people per patient. Many times, housewives and elderly people get infected with the virus and their contacts remain low as they meet very a few people. Till last month, we could only trace 14 people per patient but we are improving on this control measure.”“Among other districts, Mohali is leading as 20 people per patient are being traced, followed by Ludhiana with 18 people per patient, Barnala with 17 and Jalandhar with 16. Other districts are trying to improve. At present, our focus is to provide best treatment to the Covid patient. We are increasing our daily testing, which also plays a major role in breaking the virus chain. At present, we are testing over 40,000 people per day. After treatment and testing, we keep our focus on contact tracing,” Dr Bhaskar further added.“The state health department has given full authority to district administrations to make containment and micro-containment zones, which is also helping Punjab to control the spread. It acts like a local lockdown and is being implemented effectively. More than 100 micro-containment zones have been made in the state,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/contact-tracing-remains-poor-in-punjab-amid-second-covid-wave-101619033385552.html
22-04-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Conduct second-year medical offline exams as per schedule, says NMC||Days after the state health education minister and the Maharashtra University of Health Sciences (MUHS) postponed second and third-year MBBS examinations to June, the National Medical Commission (NMC) has released an advisory for medical institutions directing them to conduct second-year exams as well as supplementary exams for first and second semesters only in the offline mode.“The universities are advised to adhere to the existing norms for conducting theory exams. However, considering the risk stratification of the areas where medical colleges are located, all necessary precautions including staggering of small batches must be adhered to,” states the recent circular released by the Undergraduate Medical Education Board of NMC. Last week, after discussions with various stakeholders including state chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, Amit Deshmukh, the state minister for medical education tweeted the decision to postpone all undergraduate medical exams to June first week. Rising Covid-19 cases across the state was one of the main reason for this move. Along with MBBS, this decision also affects students from Ayurveda, homoeopathy and similar courses affiliated with the university.Over the past few days, second-and third-year medical students from the government and private medical colleges in Maharashtra had been requesting authorities to postpone exams especially at a time when the state is recording 50,000-60,000 cases daily. The exams in question were originally scheduled to take place in February, but were deferred first to March and then to April by the MUHS due to increasing Covid-19 cases and complaints of several medical students.NMC however said delaying exams further will have a larger impact on the next academic year, and therefore a decision has been taken to conduct pending exams in smaller batches, starting with second-year MBBS and supplementary exams.“If external examiners are not available due to the current pandemic situation, such examiners can overlook the theory exams online but internal examiners have to be physically present in the examination hall. Practical/clinical examinations may be conducted in laboratories with due precautions,” states the NMC circular. It further states that students who are unable to appear for these physical exams due to whatever reasons Will be allowed to take the examination with supplementary batches. “This will not be counted as an additional attempt for them,” said the circular.The circular has invited mixed reactions from students at present. “Medical examination will be impossible to conduct in the online mode and with correct precautions, medical institutions can conduct the said exams. The NMC has also clarified that students who are unable to appear for exams can participate in supplementary exams so students need not worry,” said Brijesh Sutaria, parent of an MBBS student.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-conduct-second-year-medical-offline-exams-as-per-schedule-says-nmc-101619033384259.html
22-04-2021||Mumbai||Restricted timings in Mumbai: Shopkeepers unhappy; citizens blame state||Amit Maru, who runs a small bakery shop in Kurla, was in for a shock as the police arrived sharp at dot 11am on Wednesday asking him to close his shop. When Maru argued that he came under essential services which are allowed to operate, the police personnel sternly told him he is allowed to operate for only four hours—7am to 11am only. Maru closed his shop to adhere to the new rules.This was the scene repeated across Mumbai a day after the state government ordered that all essential shops except medical stores could operate just for four hours. Their contention was that citizens were roaming around citing they were going to buy groceries and eatables and hampering their efforts to contain the Covid-19 virus.“There is no way I can sustain by keeping my shop open for four hours,” said Maru asking, “How can I call my workers to work for just four hours?”Urban Greens, a mini supermarket specialising in groceries which operates in Lalbaug and Byculla, opened early at 8am instead of its usual 9.30am in view of the new timings. “We are concentrating on home deliveries, but that is not a big source of income for us. Our business has fallen by 50% due to these new rules,” said Anil Parekh, owner, Urban Greens.The state government on Tuesday issued a new order, restricting timings of essential shops such as grocery, vegetable and fruit vendors, dairies, bakeries and all types of food shops among others to four hours from 7am to 11am across the state till May 1. However, the government has allowed home delivery from these shops between 7am to 8pm.The scene at Dadar vegetable market early morning was as chaotic as always as consumers crowded disregarding all social distancing norms. “This is a very narrow stretch of road and it is not possible to keep distance. I request my clients to keep distance but they don’t listen,” said Anna Padwal, who comes from Palghar to sell vegetables outside Dadar station.Mitesh Mody, secretary of Chamber of Association of Maharashtra Industry and Trade (CAMIT) which represents traders, said there was confusion over this new order. “On one hand they ask us to shut shop at 11am, and then tell us to continue with home deliveries. How can we send deliveries when our shops are shut?” questioned Mody.Citizens have criticised there rules saying restricted timings will in fact encourage crowding. “7am is a very unrealistic timing, and in the coming days we will see people crowding to get their essentials; thus defeating the very purpose of containing the virus,” said social activist Vidyut Shah.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/restricted-timings-in-mumbai-shopkeepers-unhappy-citizens-blame-state-101619033324199.html
22-04-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra begins Covid management orientation programme for MBBS graduates||On Wednesday, final year medical (MBBS) students sat through day one of the Covid-19 pandemic management orientation programme, following a recent circular from the Maharashtra University of Health Sciences (MUHS) directing mandatory attendance for the online course. The purpose of the programme, said MUHS, is to train final year medical students for the ongoing pandemic and immediately put to use their knowledge and skills for Covid-19 patient management during their internship training programme. To be conducted in the virtual mode and relayed on YouTube till April 24, students will also be allowed to put forth their questions on the chat window that will be answered by experts.“Our country is currently suffering from an infectious disease and the state of Maharashtra, in particular, is facing a shortage of trained medical manpower to manage the present situation,” read the circular released by MUHS this week. Last year, after much deliberation, the board of governors (BoG) of the Medical Council of India (MCI now National Medical Commission) had released a pandemic management module to be implemented across all medical institutions starting August 2020.Put together by a team of experts and the academic cell of MCI, the module has been designed to ensure MBBS students acquire competencies in handling not only the illness but also the social, legal and other issues arising from disease outbreaks. “The emergence of Covid-19 and its rapid spread across the globe has further underlined the need to develop these skills in our graduates. One of the desirable outcomes of the competency derived education program is to enable a medical graduate to be able to understand, investigate, treat and prevent new and emerging diseases,” stated the BoG released last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-begins-covid-management-orientation-programme-for-mbbs-graduates-101619033264240.html
22-04-2021||Mumbai||Covid vaccination drive disrupted in Thane, Navi Mumbai, Panvel||The vaccination drive in Thane, Panvel and Navi Mumbai was affected owing to shortage of vaccines on Wednesday. While the drive in Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) was completely suspended apart from one centre administrating second dose of Covaxin, the Panvel City Municipal Corporation (PCMC) too had to shut 22 vaccination centres following a shortage of vials. TMC received 3,000 doses of Covishield on Wednesday evening after the drive was suspended for an entire day. With the new stock, around eight vaccination centres with Covishield vaccine will be functional on Thursday. Majiwada vaccination centre, which administered only Covaxin booster dose, saw some chaos with several citizens claiming that despite waiting in long queue, they did not get the jab. “They should have asked us to wait according to the available dosages of vaccine; I waited for almost an hour with my aged mother for her booster dose. This is my fourth visit and attempt to get her the second dose but did not help. There is no clarity and proper announcements made on behalf of the civic body,” said Ashwini Salatry, 44, resident of Vrindavan society.Thane mayor Naresh Mhaske said, “We did not have any stock of Covishield vaccine till Wednesday evening. Only 300 dosages of Covaxin were available only for booster dose. The post-Covid care centre in Majiwada administered only second doses of Covaxin.” Last month, opposition leaders had made allegations that TMC was permitting many, including politicians, civic officials and their family and friends, to take vaccine out of turn. They cited similar instances of mismanagement to be the reason for the shortage of vaccine in the city. “Depending on the number of doses that we have received and based on the requirement, we are providing vaccines to the respective municipal corporations. On Wednesday evening, we provided few vials to all civic bodies,” said a senior official from Thane District. The Kalyan Dombivli Municipal Corporation (KDMC) on Wednesday claimed that it would run out of vaccine on Thursday and will have to suspend the drive on Friday if no fresh stock is distributed to them. “We have stock till Thursday. Later on we will have to suspend the vaccination as there will not be any enough vaccine left to continue. We have appealed for more stock, but have no clue when it will arrive,” said a KDMC official, who did not wish to be named. As of Wednesday, the civic body has a stock of 7,718 vials of Covishield and 8,022 of Covaxin. In a day, the civic body carries out around 4,500 inoculations. Several residents, however, complained that private hospitals are not administering the second dose of Covishield citing lack of stock. “I have been trying to get my second dose of Covishield since the past three days, but none of the hospitals in Dombivli MIDC have it. My second dose is due and with the increasing number of cases I wanted to get it without delay,” said Raju Nalawade, a resident of Dombivli MIDC. PCMC, too, suspended vaccination drive on Wednesday. Around 2,000 Covishield vials are expected to reach PCMC on Thursday, following which the centres will start operations for the second dose of Covishield. Meanwhile, the Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC) received 3,000 vials of Covishield on Wednesday. “Some of the urban primary health centres had to be shut by 12pm and some by 5pm due to lack of stock. If we do not get new stock on Thursday, we will only have NMMC-run hospitals and jumbo facilities to administer vaccination till the stocks last,” said NMMC commissioner Abhijit Bangar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/covid-vaccination-drive-disrupted-in-thane-navi-mumbai-panvel-101619033204223.html

Along with this, 350 beds will receive oxygen supply by Thursday morning within the Parking Plaza facility. This move has come into effect 11 days after 30 patients were shifted from the parking plaza facility to Global Covid Hospital due to a shortage of oxygen supply. Due to lack of regular oxygen supply, at least 1,500 oxygen beds in two of Thane’s civic-run hospitals have gone unused for the past 11 days. This had led to the deterioration of the health of Covid-19 patients currently admitted, as well as a backlog in the admission of severe patients. Sandeep Malvi, deputy municipal commissioner, TMC, said, “A private vendor has been finalised on Wednesday evening; they will initially provide 13 ton of oxygen supply to Parking Plaza by Thursday morning. This will restore supply to 350 oxygen and ICU beds and gradually will focus on providing oxygen for the others beds. Parking Plaza has 800 oxygen beds and 200 ICU beds. Currently, there are 375 general beds which are occupied with Covid positive patients.” The work to set up a 47-ton oxygen plant, that can refill 175 oxygen cylinders, has now begun at the parking plaza. The work is slated to be completed within a week. TMC officials also informed that by Friday all the 800 oxygen beds in the facility will be available for patients. Currently, Thane city has only 124 beds with an oxygen facility and 61 beds with intensive care unit (ICU) available in civic-run Covid hospitals. Two oxygen plants will be operational by April 30.Two of the three dedicated Covid hospitals (DCH) run by the TMC – Parking Plaza and Voltas Company hospitals – have not used the oxygen beds (in the former case, since April 10), as the amount of oxygen supplied to the civic body by the state has reduced drastically. The city receives 34 tonnes of oxygen, from both a private vendor and the state. However, this was insufficient to meet the demands of the oxygen beds run by the TMC. While Global Covid Hospital has 929 oxygen beds, the Parking Plaza has 800 oxygen beds, the civic body has now finalised another vendor who will provide around 13 ton of oxygen to the Parking Plaza by Thursday morning. The civic body will gradually focus on providing oxygen for the other beds, including ICU.TMC’s Covid hospital at Vartak Nagar (Voltas Company Hospital) is not operational yet. The city till Wednesday evening was receiving only 23 tons of oxygen. Since Global Covid Hospital was the only facility that has the capacity for patients requiring oxygen, all such patients are currently shifted there. State cabinet minister and Thane’s guardian minister Eknath Shinde on Wednesday surveyed Parking Plaza and the commencement of work to set up an oxygen plant. “We are coming up with one jumbo tank that will have the capacity of 47 tons that can refill 175 oxygen cylinders. The work for the same will be completed within a week and the oxygen will suffice for the beds within Parking Plaza. Once this plant is built, Parking Plaza Hospital will function full-fledged,” said Shinde. “In all three new plants for oxygen are being built; two of these will have a capacity of 175 metric tonnes. We shall also increase the number of oxygen beds to accommodate the 300 cylinders, such that the Parking Plaza will have [a total increased capacity of] 800 oxygen beds. Moreover, another plant will be set up, the cost of which will be borne by MMRDA. Once the oxygen supply is restored and functions properly, we shall focus on increasing the beds as well,” said Dr Vipin Sharma, commissioner, TMC at the general body held on Tuesday. “When the plant is operational, the city will get 50 tonnes of oxygen daily. We can use 47 tonnes for our patients while three tonnes can be provided to private hospitals,” added a senior officer from TMC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/private-vendor-to-provide-13-tonnes-of-oxygen-to-thane-supply-to-350-beds-to-be-restored-101619033144304.html
22-04-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Family court refuses relief to IT graduate against wife based in Australia||A woman cannot be restrained from pursuing her case in a foreign country when she and her estranged husband are already before a foreign court for partial settlement of the issues between them, a family court at Bandra held recently and dismissed a petition filed by an information technology (IT) graduate.The IT graduate had last year approached the family court for divorce on the ground of cruelty and adultery. Along with the divorce petition, he had also moved an application seeking to restrain his wife from filing a divorce petition before the court in Australia and also to restrain her from pursuing other cases filed before an Australian court.The couple has been residing out of the country for the past 10 years and now are permanent residents of Australia. Both are presently residing in Australia. However, the husband has filed a divorce petition before the family court in Mumbai.Meanwhile, the wife has approached the court in Australia for disclosure of properties of the parties for distribution of assets among them. However, before the filing of the respective litigations, the couple had already signed consent terms with regards to the custody of their child before the Family Relationship Centre, a government institution in Australia.The wife’s lawyer Shraddha Dalvi had opposed the plea contending that the husband had already submitted himself to the jurisdiction of the Australian court, therefore it was not open for him to seek restraint against the wife at Mumbai.The family court after perusal of the case record observed, “On perusal of documents, it is very apparent that not only respondent (wife) but the petitioner (husband) had subjected himself to the jurisdiction of the court at Australia, but they have agreed for parenting plan before the institution or agency of Australian Government.”“So, in this background, it is not proper for the petitioner to question the jurisdiction of the court at Australia, when he has subjected to the order of Australian court and he has obtained consent order from the said court even before presentation of this petition or even before presentation of the petition filed by wife in an Australian court,” said the family court at Bandra.The court further held, “Both the parties reside in Australia when the child is in Australia when most of the properties are in Australia, a petitioner cannot say that without there been a divorce, Australian court would divide assets and liabilities of the parties. He can initiate a similar proceeding for divorce on the ground similar to Hindu Marriage Act and the decree would be valid if it fulfils requirements of the Civil Procedure Code.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-family-court-refuses-relief-to-it-graduate-against-wife-based-in-australia-101619033085567.html
22-04-2021||Chandigarh||BSF seeks FIR against intruder Pak pigeon spotted in Amritsar||The Border Security Force (BSF) has sought registration of an FIR against an intruder from Pakistan that happens to be a pigeon. Punjab Police are seeking legal opinion on this.The pigeon perched itself on the shoulder of a BSF jawan at the Rorawala post last Saturday, apparently after flying across the border, an official said.A small piece of paper with a “contact number” was wrapped around its leg, the official said.The BSF handed over the bird to the police with a demand in writing for taking legal action. Senior superintendent of police Dhruv Dahiya said the BSF demanded registration of an FIR against the pigeon.“As the pigeon is a bird, I don’t think an FIR can be registered against it. But we have referred the matter to our legal experts for their opinion,” he said on Wednesday. The number tagged on the pigeon’s leg is being analysed, he said.Pigeons have been “captured” earlier as well in border areas with security forces suspecting espionage attempts. Homing pigeons can be used to courier information and the tags can carry coded messages. Or the birds can be innocent, tagged with identification numbers by their keepers. For now, the pigeon is being kept at the Khangarh police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/bsf-seeks-fir-against-intruder-pak-pigeon-spotted-in-amritsar-101619033085080.html
22-04-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Shiv Sena corporator threatens doctors, apologises later||A video went viral on Wednesday over an argument between Shiv Sena corporator and education committee chairman Sandhya Doshi with healthcare staff of civic-run Bhagwati Hospital. Doshi in the video is seen claiming a staff member from the hospital misbehaved with a Covid-19 patient from her electoral ward.Doshi, who is a corporator from Gorai and second-time chairman of Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s (BMC) education committee is said is heard saying in the video, “There was misbehaviour by the doctor with the patient, and hence I have come here. I can make 10 doctors like you stand here at the hospital.”The incident took place on Tuesday. In response to this, the healthcare staff at Bhagwati Hospital released a separate video threatening to resign, protesting Doshi’s behaviour. A doctor in the video is heard saying, “We are working under constant stress and are daily seeing our colleagues falling ill to Covid-19. In all this, if someone expects us to pay attention to a particular patient, it will not be possible. We request whoever claims that they can get 10 doctors like us to get them. We will resign post this.”However, both the staff at Bhagwati Hospital and Doshi later said that they have sorted the issue. Dr P Jadhav, head at Bhagwati Hospital, said, “The issue has been sorted out between the doctors and the corporator. All doctors are on duty and there is no question of any strike or resignation.”Doshi told HT, “I had gone to Bhagwati Hospital due to inappropriate behaviour with a Covid-19 patient from my ward. My ward has the highest number of cases, and it is my duty to handle them. However, whatever is seen in the video has taken place in the heat of the moment. Post that, the patient was hospitalised, I have apologised to the staff. We both exchanged something that was out of panic, and hence I apologised to the staff.”Meanwhile, BJP on the other hand has demanded action against Doshi. Pratik Karpe, BJP Corporator and education committee member of the BMC said, “Such language with doctors in this critical time when doctors are giving their best to save lives is unwanted, and also the person accompanying Doshi was not wearing a mask inside a Covid-19 Hospital. I have written to the BMC chief to taken action in the matter.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-shiv-sena-corporator-threatens-doctors-apologises-later-101619033024850.html
22-04-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai crosses 5-million Covid tests, 2 million conducted in 2 months||The city crossed the five-million mark of testing Covid-19 samples, one year after testing took off on February 3, 2020. Of the five million samples tested as of Tuesday, around 1.9 million samples were tested in the past two months as the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) ramped up its testing.According to the figures, Mumbai was testing around 20,000 samples daily till February. However, Mumbai’s testing capacity has gone up to around 50,000 daily on weekdays since March 23. As of Tuesday, Mumbai had tested 5,075,152 samples and the overall positivity rate is 11.70%.The 100,000- mark was crossed in May, 200,000 in June, 500,000 in July, followed by one-million mark in September last year. In February this year, the number further crosses the three-million mark, and the four-million mark in March. In terms of Maharashtra, a total of 24 million tests have been conducted in the past one year.Mumbai was the first city in the country to liberalise testing starting July 2020. Under this, any citizen wanting to get tested for Covid-19 was allowed to get tested. Before this, only symptomatic patients or those having prescription from a doctor were allowed to get tested.Since July 2020, BMC also started usage of rapid antigen kits that give results in 30 minutes but are less reliable. BMC initially maintained the ratio of 30% of the tests being conducted daily via rapid antigen kits and remaining via RT-PCR kits. Later, it went up to 50% in December 2020. Currently, 60% of the tests are conducted using RT-PCR method and 40% using rapid antigen kits.On Wednesday alone, 47,270 samples were tested of which 7,654 were found to be positive with a positivity rate of 16.19%. The city also reported 62 deaths on Wednesday. This took the city’s case tally to 601,713 and toll to 12,508. The city’s recovery rate is 83% with 504,466 recoveries and fatality rate is 2.07%. There are 83,450 active cases in the city.Further, owing to the surge in cases, the daily positivity rate in the city had gone up to 25% in the first week of April, which has since come down to around 15%. However, though the number of testing in Mumbai has increased drastically in the past one month, there is a huge difference in the number of tests conducted in Mumbai and Delhi. Mumbai conducted around 45,000 tests on Tuesday whereas Delhi conducted tests on around 86,000 samples.Experts maintain that though the city’s testing has been scaled up drastically, Mumbai requires more. Dr Madhav Sathe, former microbiology professor at BYL Nair Hospital, said, “If tests are not increased beyond 50,000 per day, we must ensure that the results are given to the patient at least within 24 hours after sample collection. Also, more tests should be done in those parts of Mumbai where very few RT-PCR tests are done daily. An attempt should be made to increase the test number up to 60,000 to 70,000 tests per day, and the motto should be to trace early, test fast and treat immediately.”Meanwhile, Mumbai mayor Kishori Pednekar on Wednesday, while talking to reporters, said, “I request citizens in Mumbai to not lower their guard. We are witnessing that daily cases have stabilised in the city, but we need to ensure that our cases remain under control by following Covid-appropriate behaviour.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-crosses-5-million-covid-tests-2-million-conducted-in-2-months-101619033024266.html
22-04-2021||Mumbai||No green corridor given to Oxygen Express, alleges Shiv Sena; CR denies allegations||The Shiv Sena on Wednesday alleged that the Railways did not provide green corridor to the Oxygen Express dispatched to bring oxygen from Visakhapatnam as Maharashtra is facing shortage of oxygen for Covid-19 patients. Sena chief spokesperson and former Union minister Arvind Sawant slammed the Centre for its “cruel politics” over supply of oxygen, alleging that the train that left Kalamboli on April 19 night was at Akola in Maharashtra 24 hours after its departure. He also demanded resignation of railway minister Piyush Goyal.A passenger train journey between Mumbai’s Lokmanya Tilak Terminus and Visakhapatnam takes a little over 28 hours to complete. With a green corridor, the journey was expected to be faster. Sawant said there is “no guarantee when oxygen will reach us”. Speaking to reporters in Mumbai, Sawant said the Centre has set a precedent to indulge in politics at such a difficult time for the country. “Tankers left from Kalamboli on April 19; last night (Tuesday) at around 8.30 the train was at Akola — 24 hours after it left. Around 2-2.30am [on Wednesday] it reached around Nagpur. Later [on Wednesday evening] it was near Raipur, when it has to go to Visakhapatnam. You (Goyal) are saying green corridor is being made, but so far it has not reached there. The train has to come back as well. We do not expect it to arrive in next three days. This kind of politics is cruel... The railway minister should resign for this negligence,” Sawant said. He further added that the government was playing with the lives of thousands of people. Sawant is expected to write to Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeking Goyal’s resignation and an inquiry into the delay to transport oxygen to Maharashtra.While Goyal was not available for reaction, the Central Railway (CR) denied the allegations. “The train is running as per the pre-determined route and there is no delay or change of route. The train is now running in the East Coast Railway Zone and will soon reach Visakhapatnam Steel Plant Siding. Oxygen Express is being run with priority,” said Shivaji Sutar, chief public relations officer, CR.Senior railway officials also stated that the Oxygen Express, which has tankers, cannot be moved from the railway ghat (mountain pass) sections and have to be moved by railways goods section.“The express is being given priority, but we cannot operate the train from the ghat areas like other passenger trains are operated. The train went through Vasai and will be reaching Visakhapatnam in some time. The routes were already defined. There are also particular speeds at which goods or roll-on roll-off is operated,” said a senior railway official who did not wanted to be named.The train is likely to reach Visakapatnam at Wednesday night, after which the tankers will be moved towards the steel plant.Sawant also alleged that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led Centre had “stooped down” to show Maharashtra in bad light. He said, “Maharashtra chief minister put in restrictions to control the cases. For the past few days, cases in Mumbai have come down. If these restrictions are increased, cases will further decrease. But to not allow Maharashtra government to be seen as progressive and doing good work, they have stooped down to low level of politics, which is seen in the past few days in the matter of Remdesivir and vaccination. All these things are condemnable.” Responding to the allegations, Maharashtra BJP spokesperson Keshav Upadhye said there are attempts to hide state government’s failure to tackle the Covid-19 situation. “The Union government has provided all assistance the states require. This is nothing but a weak attempt to shift the blame of their failure on the Centre,” Upadhye said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/no-green-corridor-given-to-oxygen-express-alleges-shiv-sena-cr-denies-allegations-101619032964236.html

The court, while rejecting the grandmother’s petition, held that the best interest of the children was to be with their mother and due to the situation in war-torn Afghanistan, the daughter-in-law had a right to stay back in India. The court, however, granted visitation rights to the grandmother and paternal aunt while dismissing the petition. The daughter-in-law who was originally an Indian had married an Afghani man who had come to Mumbai for education in 2010 and had moved to Afghanistan and had borne four sons. However, she was widowed in 2018 after which she returned to India with her four sons and started living with her parents and brother in Kalyan. A division bench of justice SS Shinde and justice Manish Pitale, while hearing the petition of the 79-year-old grandmother was informed by advocate Mohammad Adenwala, that his client was not seeking to separate the children from their mother, hence the petition sought that the mother and four children accompany them to Kabul where they could live a life of comfort and ease as opposed to the life she and her children were living in Kalyan. The grandmother further claimed that the four brothers and a sister of the deceased had agreed to take care of the financial needs of the widow and her children if she returned to Kabul. After marriage in India, the couple had shifted to Kabul. However, in 2018 the husband was killed in a bombardment by government forces, while the fourth child was still in the womb. All four children had an Afghani passport even though two were born in India. After her return to India in 2018, the woman started residing with her brother and parents at Kalyan allegedly in a single room tenement. This was the reason why the grandmother and paternal aunt of the children approached the HC seeking directions to the woman to return to Kabul with the children. However, advocate Uzair Kazi for the woman, her parents and brother informed the court that the woman was financially secure, hence the assumptions by the grandmother were misplaced. Kazi further submitted that due to the warlike situation in Afghanistan, the woman feared for the lives of her children and hence believed that staying in India would be more beneficial for the safety and prospective future. He also submitted that as per Muslim Law, the mother had a paramount right to have custody of the children and hence the prayers of the grandmother and aunt be rejected. After hearing the submissions, the court observed, “We believe that on the test of best interest and welfare of the children, it would be appropriate that they continue in the custody of their mother i.e. respondent No.2. In any case, the custody of the children with their mother is neither illegal nor improper and therefore, we are not inclined to issue a writ of habeas corpus as prayed by the petitioners.” While dismissing the petition the court directed visitation rights to the grandmother and aunt when they come to India and weekly interaction with the children through video calling on weekends.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-rejects-afghan-woman-s-plea-for-custody-of-four-grandsons-101619032904333.html

Shatabdi Hospital phase 1 and 2 at the King George’s Medical University will also be made Covid facilities, as per two separate orders. Doctors at the KGMU stated that the Shatabdi phase 2 building runs a blood bank, clinical haematology, surgical oncology department and a linear accelerator for patients. They said this needs planning so that facilities can be run properly.As oncology services and blood bank have to run along with Covid facility, making the Shatabdi phase 2 building a Covid facility will adversely affect these facilities, they said. “We are going to hold a discussion over this issue and find a solution to increase the number of Covid beds and also run these facilities,” said Dr Sandip Tiwari, in-charge of the Covid facility on the campus. The KGMU is running a 500-bed Covid facility at the DPMR building and the number of beds is going to be increased beyond 800. For this, Gandhi ward surgical ward one and two and Shatabdi phase one and two were acquired by the district administration. “Many patients need treatment for diseases, which cannot be delayed. Hence apart from Covid facilities in the city designated non-Covid hospitals also need to run simultaneously,” said Dr Sandip Kapoor, director of Healthcity hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/lucknow-admn-to-acquire-3-pvt-hosps-for-treatment-of-covid-patients-101619032845393.html

Earlier, the workers used to get paid ₹1,700 per month. The last hike given to the workers was in 2017 and at that time they used to earn ₹1,200 per month. The mid-day meal workers in the district said that it was a relief for them as they had been working hard to prepare packets of food grains along with the teachers and then delivering the same to the doorsteps of the children amid the lockdown imposed by the Central government last year. Forty-year-old Usha Rani, a mid-day meal worker at Government Primary School, Chanan Devi, said, “I have been working in this school for the last 10 years. We reach school early as we have to serve meals to the children by 11.30 am. We have been preparing meals for over 600 students every day and put in a lot of effort to serve delicious and healthy food to the children studying in Class 1 to 5. This enhancement in salary will further motivate existing workers to continue with their jobs.” Last year on September 23, the state government had announced paid maternity leave for 180 days for mid-day meal workers under the Maternity Benefit Act. Another MDM cook in a Government Model Senior Secondary School, Cemetery Road, Vandana, said, “This is the biggest respite for the workers as we are paid a very meagre salary per month. I was expecting a hike of ₹1,300 per month. I have been preparing meals in our school with other workers for more than 700 students but due to the surge in Covid -19 cases, now we are not serving meals to students as schools are closed till April 30. The state government even paid us salary for June last year, while usually, during the summer break in June, the authorities do not give us a salary.” While as per the officials of the state MDM Cell, they do not have details as to when the salary will be hiked. When contacted, Prabcharan Singh, general manager of the state MDM cell, SAS Nagar, said, “I will not be able to comment as we haven’t received any information regarding when the salary of the MDM workers will be increased from ₹1,700 to ₹2,200.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/punjab-announces-rs-500-salary-hike-for-mid-day-meal-workers-101619032844841.html

His condition is stable and he is recuperating at the hospital. He may be discharged after a day, party leaders said on Wednesday.“Our party president Sharad Pawar saheb was admitted at Breach Candy Hospital in Mumbai last evening for a follow up procedure post his gallbladder surgery. The procedure has been conducted and he is now recuperating in the hospital,” said Nawab Malik, NCP chief spokesperson and state minority affairs minister.On April 12, Pawar had undergone a surgery after being diagnosed with multiple stones in the gallbladder. The 80-year-old veteran leader underwent laparoscopic surgery, also known as keyhole surgery, which requires minimal invasive surgical procedure.Since Pawar’s was not in a condition to go for gallbladder surgery immediately as there was swelling in his pancreas, a strain was put up by the doctors then to prevent more stones from slipping into the bile duct.“Doctors have removed a strain that was put up to stop gallstones from slipping into the pancreas. It was done after one of the gallstones slipped into his bile duct that caused jaundice and pancreatitis,” said a NCP functionary, privy to the development.Prior to the gallbladder surgery, doctors had to conduct an emergency endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) procedure on the NCP chief on March 30 to remove the gallstone that had slipped into his bile duct, causing blockage to the flow leading to immense pain, mild jaundice and pancreatitis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/sharad-pawar-undergoes-postoperative-procedure-after-gallbladder-surgery-101619032784166.html
22-04-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: IIT-B’s design for solar-powered housing wins big in international competition||A team from the Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay (IIT-B), won the first runner up position at the Solar Decathlon, a competition by the United States department of energy for designing affordable, high-performance and low-carbon buildings that mitigate climate change. Team Shunya, a group at IIT-B started in 2012, is the only one to represent India in the competition. The team of around 46 students has conceived a cluster-level design of a community of houses that can be powered by solar energy. The Artist Village at Belapur in Navi Mumbai was considered as the base for the design. The team has designed a community-dwelling of 10 housing units—four single bedroom houses, four double bedroom and two triple bedroom houses—over an area of around 16,000 square feet (sqft), all powered by solar energy. “The design incorporates a self-designed automation system and application, cluster-level heating, ventilation and air conditioning system with radiant panels, creating a net positive energy cluster efficient by all standards,” said Bhavya Kasagni, student team head, Shunya. The cluster can be constructed for ₹2,718 per sqft. What’s unique about the design is that it is that of a cluster of 10 houses that generate their own energy needs through solar panels. The design also comes with a do it yourself (DIY) concept that allows occupants to select different styles of windows, doors, railings from a catalogue to make their house unique from others. While Shunya has always participated in the Decathlon for the design and build category, this year, for the first time the team went for the design category alone. “Because of the Covid-19 pandemic, we were all working remotely. We couldn’t actually build the houses and therefore we decided to go for the design category,” said Kasagni, who is a research assistant in the department of electrical engineering. This meant assigning tasks to members in each of its six subgroups of architecture, civil, mechanical, electrical, communication and sponsorship and market analysis. Several rounds of simulations were done to achieve an optimum design. “The Covid-19 pandemic and lockdown posed a challenge, unlike previous years when we were on campus and could work together. This year, we attended classes virtually all day, complete our assigned tasks and then meet virtually every night to take stock of the work,” said Kasagni. The team plans to file a patent for their design.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-iit-b-s-design-for-solar-powered-housing-wins-big-in-international-competition-101619032604277.html

Tirupur health authorities have informed the state officials to alert their counterparts in Jharkhand so that co-passengers of the same train could be tracked. Samples taken from the workers came back as positive on April 7. Their 14-day isolation period would have ended Wednesday. The workers were being treated at the government hospital and medical college in Tirupur for a week. “After being discharged they were asked to quarantine for another week but they escaped on the 5th day,” said Dr Jagadish Kumar, deputy director of health services of Tirupur. “They are unlikely to pose a risk as they’re all asymptomatic and have remained in quarantine except for two days but it is still a violation of protocol so we have registered a police complaint and informed the medical team in Jharkhand.”The district police are likely to register a complaint under sections of the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897. “We have received the complaint today and we will be registering an FIR for Covid-19 violations,” said sub-inspector Sivaganesh. The workers were employed with a cotton mill at Vellakoil in Tirupur and were undergoing quarantine at the staff quarters at the mill. “Even the mill management was not aware that they had left,” he said. As cases rise in Tamil Nadu and several restrictions have been imposed including a night curfew, migrant workers from different parts of the state are queuing up at railway stations to go home. The belt of Tirupur, Coimbatore and Erode in the western region of Tamil Nadu are dotted with industries and manufacturing factories and a major part of the workforce is formed by migrant workers, predominantly from Jharkhand, Odisha and Bihar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/tamil-nadu-16-migrant-workers-jump-quarantine-to-return-home-101619032424710.html

A L Somayaji appearing for the state as special senior counsel made this submission to the first bench of chief justice Sanjib Banerjee and justice Senthil Ramamoorthy. The court was hearing a plea by a former additional SP of special branch CID, R Kuppusamy who sought the case to be transferred to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). During the hearing, advocate Abdul Saleem, representing the suspended DGP informed that the accused had appeared before the ICC and CB-CID so there was no necessity for a CBI probe. The court disposed off the writ petition stating that it didn’t require a central agency probe since the CB-CID is also investigating the case which is being monitored by a single judge bench of justice N Anand Venkatesh.The chief justice however directed the state counsel to ensure that the investigation is free and fair. The Tamil Nadu government had set up a six-member ICC on February 25 after the woman officer had complained to the state DGP, J K Tripathy. A day later, the state directed the CB-CID to also take over investigations. On March 23, the CB-CID had informed the court that it would submit its final report within eight- weeks. Justice Venkatesh who had taken suo motu cognisance of the case to monitor its probe expressed that he was satisfied with the progress made based on the case diaries and submissions of the investigating officer. Statements of two accused policemen and 87 witnesses had been recorded in the case while CCTV footage was under analysis. The CB-CID had registered an FIR against two accused- the special DGP and SP of Chengalpattu district under sections 354-A(2) (sexual harassment) and 341, 506(1) under the IPC and section 4 of the Tamil Nadu prohibition of harassment of women Act 1998. The complainant had said that the special DGP sexually harassed her while they were on duty for chief minister Edappadi Palanswami’s tour. The investigating agency is also probing the role of the SP in preventing her from filing a complaint by stopping her vehicle and bringing in a posse of policemen and a special strike force at the Chengalpattu toll gate on February 22.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/panel-submitted-report-in-ips-officer-s-case-tn-govt-tells-hc-101619032424102.html
22-04-2021||Bangalore||Bengaluru: Crematoriums run overtime while kin wait||Bengaluru: Despite a relative’s relentless attempts, 24-year-old Sunitha refused to move away from the ambulance, where she has been for more than an hour looking at her mother Valliyamma’s body. While she refused to move using hand gestures, she took a moment to ask a question to her relative: “What number it now?” “Ten,” replied the relative, adding it could take another five hours before their turn and that she should take rest.On Wednesday, Sunitha was among the many relatives waiting outside the government crematorium in Summanahalli in Bengaluru, one of the seven locations allocated to cremate Covid-19 causalities. “We have been waiting here since morning and they are telling us they will be able to cremate her only after five hours. Her body kept in an ambulance for all this while, there is not even ice box,” said Sunitha.More than 19 ambulances were waiting outside this crematorium on Wednesday with dead bodies in them. As no one is allowed near the furnaces, family members were seen performing last rites around the ambulances.Inside the crematorium, the staff had their own troubles. Earlier on Wednesday, the door of one of two furnaces malfunctioned, which took a couple of hours to fix. “Our maximum capacity is to cremate 16 bodies a day that, too, if we push ourselves and machine. For the past few days, we have been cremating more at least 25 bodies a day. Today (Wednesday), we have already got 23 bodies (at 2.30 pm), we are told more bodies are coming,” said Vinod R, a supervisor of the crematorium.The crematorium has four staffers to operate the furnaces. “Their shift starts at 7 am and because of the number of bodies, they have to work till 2 am. We are not turning any bodies back, because we know what the families are going through, but we are finding it physically difficult to keep up with the workload,” he added.In the first wave of Covid-19, the highest number of deaths reported was 75 on July 17, 2020, but in the second wave, the number of deaths reported has been much higher. On Monday, 97 deaths were reported in Bengaluru. The pressure of this increase is being felt at crematoriums across the city. The numbers didn’t show any considerable reduction, with the city reporting 92 and 70 deaths on Tuesday and Wednesday, respectively.Around 7km away from Summanhalli, at Peenya crematorium, the situation was no different. The centre received 23 dead bodies by Wednesday afternoon and the six furnace operators were preparing for another long night.Renuskesh, the supervisor of the centre, has bloodshot eyes from sleeping for just three hours the previous night. “We were told to close the gates once we get around 15 bodies, which is our capacity, but when people plead in front of us, we can’t be inhumane. The workers have been sleeping in the crematorium itself. They haven’t met their families for days,” he said.The furnace operators are contract labourers, who until recently were not even paid their salaries. “We get only ₹13,000 and after cuts, it comes down to ₹10,000. But for close to a year, we were not paid our salaries. It was only recently because the authorities needed us that our salaries were paid. Despite this, we didn’t strike or stop working, that is because we see the pain of these families,” said Ramanajaiah, one of the contract workers at Peenya.While the employees are ready to work the long hours, there are many aspects that are beyond them. “Firstly, the local residents have been objecting to the furnaces running late into the night. But the biggest problem is the furnace itself. We can’t keep it running like this. It needs to cool down for at least 7-8 hours. Otherwise, it will break down soon. Also, as the number of bodies is increasing and cleaning the remains from under the furnace needs time too. We are not getting any time for this,” added Renuskesh.He added that just seven cremation centres for Covid-19 casualties in the entire city was not enough. As the number of deaths is increasing, pushing the furnaces beyond their capacity will lead to a collapse and more chaos, Renuskesh said.At the Banashankari crematorium, two men in threw their personal protective equipment (PPE) kits on the road after a heated argument with the crematorium staff. The staff did not allow the ambulance, which arrived at the centre, to enter as furnaces had reached the capacity. “We already have 24 bodies, and we won’t be able to finish it by even 3 am. But people are not understanding, they are making influential people call us, but when there is no space, what do we do?” asked a crematorium staff on the condition of anonymity.Acknowledging the shortage of cremation slots, Karnataka deputy chief minister Dr CN Ashwatha Narayana on Wednesday said that instead of just seven crematoria, all available cremation centres will be used for Covid-19 cases.“From today onwards, the final rites of those who succumb to Covid-19 will be performed in all the 13 crematoriums of the city. I have discussed the problem related to the cremation with Gaurav Gupta, Chief Commissioner of BBMP and steps have been taken to make arrangements for the dignified burial of those who lose lives due to the pandemic,” Narayana told HT on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bengaluru-crematoriums-run-overtime-while-kin-wait-101619032064127.html

During a virtual review of the situation in these four high Covid-19 incidence districts, he also laid stress on maintaining smooth supply of oxygen, Remdisivir and other life-saving drugs. “Improve Covid management at all levels continuously. The principal secretary (medical education) and the principal secretary to the chief minister should review the progress in establishment of oxygen plants at medical colleges and private hospitals in the districts,” the chief minister said, according to a government statement. The ministers in charge of the four districts, divisional commissioners, district magistrates, police chiefs, chief medical officers and the heads of medical institutions also participated in the meeting. “The officers concerned in each district, in coordination with their minister in charge, must further improve the efforts for Covid control in their respective districts. All Covid-19 hospitals — government or private — must have a nodal officer each,” he said. Calling for tough action against hoarders, he spoke about doing raids. Yogi asked about better handling of ambulance services for Covid-19 patients, effective implementation of containment zones and making people aware of Covid safety and prevention. He laid stress on wearing of masks and social distancing through public address systems, the role of nigrani samitis (monitoring committees) and contact tracing in preventing the spread of the Covid-19 infection. The chief minister asked for effective management of quarantine centres for migrants reaching these districts, screening, testing, if required, and proper lodging and food arrangements for them. He also asked for effective implementation of corona curfew and night curfew in the four districts. “There should not be any such action on the part of the administration of hospitals regarding oxygen or lifesaving drugs that would harm people’s confidence,” he said. Deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya, medical education minister Suresh Khanna, health minister Jai Pratap Singh, and Jal Shakti minister Mahendra Singh too attended the meeting virtually.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/up-cm-asks-for-continuous-enhancement-of-covid-19-beds-in-four-districts-101619031584072.html
22-04-2021||Chandigarh||Himachal forest dept seeks choppers to douse fires||With the prolonged dry spell sparking off forest fires across all 12 districts of Himachal Pradesh, the forest department has sought choppers to douse the raging blaze as most affected patches are inaccessible by road. The fires have so far devoured at least 8,415 hectares of forest land. Forest minister Rakesh Pathania said he will raise the issue in the Cabinet. “We have asked the government to provide us choppers as not all affected forests can be accessed through roads,” he said. Deficient rainfall, little moisture in soil and man-made blazes are responsible for the fire incidents. Himachal Pradesh frequently witnesses forest fires during dry weather as pines shed resinous needles that are inflammable. February recorded a rain deficit of 82% and March 62%. This year, at least 845 cases of the forest fire have been reported and 620 cases registered. With 132 fire incidents reported so far, Mandi is the worst affected district. As many as 101 incidents were logged in Bilaspur district’s cirh forests as the pine is highly combustible, 90 in Dharamshala and 72 in Nahan.  “Around two dozen incidents have been reported around Shimla this year. A fire in the woods surrounding the famous Tara Devi Temple could only be brought under control after three days. Shimla was engulfed in a blanket of smoke blanket in the morning. The government needs to make vigorous efforts to control the situation,” said former Shimla mayor Sanjay Chauhan. The fires, which have wrecked significant damage to fauna and flora, is keeping the forest department on its toes. Forest department officials estimate that so far 2,000 plants have been destroyed in fire and a loss of around ₹136 crore has been incurred. Apart from tying up with the fire department, the forest department is seeking villagers’ assistance and has deployed several tankers to douse the flames. A forest official, who did not wish to be named, said, “Most fire incidents are caused due to human negligence as they mostly start in and around habitations.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/himachal-forest-dept-seeks-choppers-to-douse-fires-101619031044688.html

The Sector 62 resident, who works at a private firm located in the same sector, lives with his elderly parents and wife at Nirvana Apartments. “We started going to the office since January. In the second week of April, a colleague tested positive for coronavirus. Following this, all those who came in his contact were asked to isolate. I also got myself tested. On Sunday, my report came back positive and I also developed a fever. Doctors asked me to isolate myself,” he said.But Singh was finding it difficult to isolate in his 2BHK flat and decided to go to a private home isolation facility. “I found a private home isolation facility in Sector 58 where a room with an attached washroom, along with lunch and dinner, was available for ₹2,500 per day. Thinking about the safety of my wife and parents, I opted for it and moved there for a week,” he said.The private home isolation facility has been started in Noida by Your Space, a PG accommodation provider. With PG accommodations rendered empty, the rooms have been converted into a home isolation facility.“The home isolation facility is for asymptomatic to mild patients of coronavirus. We currently have a facility in Sector 58 which has 90 rooms and another one is coming up in Sector 62. Currently, 25 Covid-19 patients are using the facility in Noida,” said Venayak Gupta, head of growth, Your Space.Your Space is also running a home isolation facility with 35 rooms at Malviya Nagar in South Delhi, Gupta said. Meanwhile, at-home services like antibody tests are also gaining popularity among senior citizens in Noida. A private firm, Antara Assisted Care Services, is providing antibody tests and even X-rays at home for seniors in Delhi-NCR. With the recent wave of coronavirus, chest X-rays are done in order to be informed about any changes in lungs that may remain hidden from the patient in case of a false Covid test result.“The X-ray facility at home is available at a price of ₹2,500. Seniors no longer need to stand in long queues or change clothes before the test which allows for a hassle-free experience along with a minimized risk of infection,” said Vaibhav Poddar, CEO, Antara Assisted Care Services.Antibody tests are also being done at home for the senior citizens. “Antara provides this service to seniors at the comfort of their homes at a cost of ₹625. Antibody tests are a way to identify whether one’s body will be able to fight the virus. This helps seniors plan their future check-ups and medicine intake better. It acts as a warning for taking the necessary next steps,” said Poddar.Apart from this, the firm also provides pathology and rehabilitation services, and Covid nursing and attendant services for senior citizens.As Covid-19 cases increase rapidly, Antara officials said that the firms’ call centres are getting 800 queries a day from seniors, as against 100-150 calls a day earlier.“With the increase in cases, we are also witnessing an increase in demand for products such as oximeters, nebulizers, etc,” a statement from the firm said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/private-home-isolation-facility-at-home-services-help-covid-patients-in-noida-101619030984029.html

According to police, he used to run a box manufacturing business in Delhi till last year, which went under during the lockdown.“He first sold the injections at a smaller profit margin to people he had come in contact through social media,” said Abhishek Singh, deputy commissioner of police, crime.Ghai later allegedly sold the injections for between ₹15,000 to ₹40,000. The market price for the drug is between ₹899 to ₹4,000 depending on the manufacturer. Police said he sourced the injections from Chandigarh.“We are working on identifying who was providing him with the medicine and to how many people he had already sold the injections to. His accomplices, if any, are also being looked at,” said the DCP.In a joint operation of the sector 20 police with crime branch, Ghai was nabbed from near a private school in sector 29 on Tuesday night and police allegedly recovered 105 Remdesivir injections (100 made in India and five from Bangladesh) from his possession along with ₹1.54 lakh and a Santro car.He was booked at the sector 20 police station under sections 420 (cheating) of the Indian Penal Code and relevant sections of the Drugs and cosmetics Act and the Epidemic Act.AIIMS director Randeep Guleria on Monday asked doctors to exercise caution while prescribing Remdesivir to patients and said that the drug being used to treat Covid-19 was not a ‘magic bullet’. He advised doctors that the drug does not reduce mortality and is of no use if given to people with mild symptoms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/man-hoarding-remdesivir-injections-nabbed-in-noida-101619030744093.html

Till late evening on Wednesday, 75 dead bodies, including 50 bodies of Covid patients, arrived at the crematorium, officials said. The facility is struggling to maintain order during the last rites of bodies, said officials of Noida Lok Manch (NLM), an NGO which takes care of maintenance of the cremation ground. On Tuesday, at least 50 cremations took place and on Monday 45 bodies were cremated here, said the officials. They also said that on an average 120 to 180 bodies are usually cremated in a month on normal days. Though Gautam Budh Nagar district has recorded only 13 deaths due to Covid-19 in the past three days, the officials said that some bodies were brought to the crematorium from neighbouring districts. The facility has 24 manual platforms and two CNG chambers, the officials said, adding that 12 new are being built to handle the pressure.On Wednesday, NLM sought help from the police to enforce social distancing guidelines at the facility. “We appeal to people to not visit the cremation ground in large numbers because it is creating pressure on our staff. More than 50 people are turning up with each dead body, thereby causing disorder and infection risk to staff members. We had to call in police to enforce order,” said Mahesh Saxena, general secretary of NLM. NLM said it has increased its staff members from 10 to 20 three days ago to handle the rush.Meanwhile, the Noida authority has deployed at least 20 additional staff at the facility that include three junior engineers and as many supervisors to maintain the order. “We have directed the staff to work day and night to make sure all bodies that reach the facility are cremated. Currently, two CNG chambers, along with manual platforms that require wood, are operational. We have procured one more CNG machine that will start operations on Friday. Two more CNG chambers will start functioning by end of April,” said Ritu Maheshwari, chief executive officer, Noida authority.The NLM officials said that pressure is mounting on the facility because bodies from nearby districts such as Faridabad and Bulandshahr are also coming here. As a result, the cremation ground spread over 13 acres and located near Kalindi Kunj Barrage on Yamuna along the embankment road is witnessing dead bodies even during night time, they said.“We have suggested the administration for a new cremation ground either in Noida or Greater Noida, because one is not adequate in view of the current situation,” said Maheshwari.During the period from June to November last year, the maximum cremations that had taken place were between 30 and 40, the officials said. Meanwhile, the NLM has sought wood from the Noida authority for the manual cremation of bodies. “We have an adequate arrangement of wood for the cremation from Modi Nagar,” said Maheshwari.“We request the visitors to stay outside the cremation ground and cooperate for general good,” said Ranvijay Singh, additional deputy commissioner of police, who was present at the facility on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/noida-cremation-facility-struggles-to-maintain-order-amid-surge-in-dead-bodies-101619030684890.html
22-04-2021||Noida||Noida traffic police make green corridor for oxygen tanker||Noida: The Gautam Budh Nagar traffic police on Wednesday afternoon created a green corridor for an oxygen tanker from Greater Noida to the DND Flyway, from where the Delhi Police escorted it to a private hospital in the national capital. The 30km green corridor was made from the factory of Inox Air Products Pvt Ltd, a leading oxygen supplier in Delhi-NCR, at Surajpur in Greater Noida to DND Flyway, officials said, adding that the tanker was carrying 14,000 litres of oxygen. Ganesh Saha, deputy commissioner of police (traffic), GB Nagar, said that the oxygen manufacturer had requested the police to escort the tanker for safety. “A police team reached the firm’s plant in Greater Noida in the afternoon. The team made a green corridor and escorted the tanker to DND Flyway in 30 minutes. From there, a Delhi Police team escorted it to a hospital in the national capital,” he said. The DCP said that the traffic police will create green corridors for all oxygen tankers passing through Noida. The traffic police have also issued a helpline number – 9971009001 – for the oxygen cylinder providers if they need green corridor. “If people face difficulty in getting life saving medicines in their neighbourhood, they can also contact us. We will try to arrange the medicines and deliver to them,” Saha said. A senior official of the Delhi Police said that a green corridor is being made wherever there is a movement of oxygen cylinders in the capital.Despite repeated attempts, Abhishek Yadav, manager (sales) at Inox Air Products, could not be contacted for a comment. Meanwhile, according to news agency PTI, the Uttar Pradesh government has issued an order and stationed officers at the oxygen manufacturing plant in Greater Noida to check movement of oxygen cylinders. Gautam Budh Nagar district magistrate Suhas LY on Tuesday issued orders posting two senior officers round-the-clock at the Greater Noida factory of Inox Air Products. According to PTI, the officers will “be present at the company site during the allotted hours and ensure adequate supply of oxygen to Covid-19 hospitals” in the GB Nagar district, the order by Suhas said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-traffic-police-make-green-corridor-for-oxygen-tanker-101619030684199.html
22-04-2021||Noida||Gautam Budh Nagar allows industries to function during curfew||Gautam Budh Nagar on Wednesday registered four Covid-19 related deaths in the last 24 hours, taking the death toll to 118, according to the Uttar Pradesh health department bulletin on Wednesday. The district also recorded 536 cases taking the tally of positive cases to 32,133 and 4009 active cases. Government and private hospitals in the district faced shortage of oxygen. While the district required 60 metric tonnes (MT) of oxygen a day, the supply was less than 10 MT. Suhas LY, district magistrate, GB Nagar, said that due to rise in the number of Covid patients, the oxygen demand had increased sharply. “There is acute shortage of oxygen in the hospitals but the supply has not stopped. We are trying to manage things with limited resources,” he said. Meanwhile, the GB Nagar district administration has allowed all the industrial units to function during the weekend curfew in the district. “The employees should produce their IDs when asked by the officials,” he said. The same will be implemented in Ghaziabad as well. The move comes after the Awnish Kumar Awasthi, addl chief secretary to UP government, issued a letter to the district administration and police on Wednesday. On April 16, the government had issued directions for shutdown from 8 pm on Saturday to 7am on Monday. On Tuesday, the government again issued the directions to extend the weekend curfew from Friday 8 pm till Monday 7am.Sudhir Shrivastava, Noida Entrepreneurship Association (NEA) vice president and spokesperson, welcomed the move. “The industries have already been closed for months and suffered losses. Now they function with limited workforce,” he said. NEA has around 3000 members who deal in various fields, like mobile phone accessories, ITs, garments, packaging, cable, etc. Shrivastava also said that the UP and Delhi government should make a coordination for enforcement. “We source some of our raw materials from Delhi, where the government has enforced a weeklong lockdown. We can’t buy any products from there now. If the enforcement continues, Noida industry will suffer. There should be a similar enforcement order for industries in both Noida and Delhi,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/gautam-budh-nagar-allows-industries-to-function-during-curfew-101619030624053.html
22-04-2021||Noida||Private hospitals grapple with limited oxygen supply||Ghaziabad: The situation at St Joseph Hospital in Nandgram went out of hand for a brief moment when the hospital ran out of oxygen supply early Wednesday morning and officials were found running pillar to post to procure four cylinders and administer the life-saving gas to 25 patients on Covid beds. Lalit Goel, manager (operations) of St Joseph Hospital, said, “We ran out of oxygen around 4am. At least 25 patients were in need of oxygen at that moment. We somehow managed to arrange four cylinders from private sources and then reached out to the district administration for help. The oxygen supply was regularised later.” Goel added, “Nowadays, we require around 60-70 oxygen cylinders per day against the previous requirement of 30-35 cylinders. We are planning to install an oxygen generator that will be put in place in three to four days.” The shortage of oxygen supply has hit several hospitals in Ghaziabad. Officials familiar with the issue said the district needs about 46,000 cubic metre of oxygen supply per day but was getting only about 30,000 cubic metre of oxygen per day. An official familiar with the developments said that the city, on April 18, received about 12,700 cubic metre of oxygen supply, of which about 5,500 cubic metre was supplied to a single health care facility. Another private hospital, whose officials requested not to be named, said they were left with only five oxygen cylinders on Monday when at least 55 patients required the life-saving gas. “We repeatedly requested the authorities to regularise the supply and also arranged cylinders on our own from clinics and nursing homes known to us. On Tuesday, 70 more cylinders came and 50 were in operation,” said the officer from the second private hospital. In an official statement issued on April 20, Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath directed that every hospital should have minimum 24 to 36 hours of oxygen backup with them. “We require about 400 cylinders of oxygen per day and the administration has assured that supply will be regularised. We are trying to add 20 more Covid beds. If we get the supply, we will be able to operate those beds at the earliest. Now, the oxygen supply to industries has stopped so we are expecting the supply to improve further. Our backup supply is being maintained as per cycle,” said Dr Sharad Agarwal, CEO of LeCrest Hospital in Vasundhara. Officials of the Indian Medical Association, Ghaziabad, also held a a detailed meeting with the district magistrate and other officers on Wednesday afternoon and raised the issue of oxygen supply. “The hospitals are getting oxygen just-in-time and many hospitals have no backup of 24-36 hours. It is so as the demand has suddenly increased four times due to a surge in Covid-19 infections. There was sudden shortage at some hospitals in the last couple of days and we requested the administration officials to ensure such incidents don’t get repeated in future,” said Dr Ashish Agarwal, president of IMA, Ghaziabad. During the meeting with IMA office-bearers, the administration said that they have formed a co-ordination committee comprising several officers, including IMA officials, to strengthen co-ordination. “The oxygen suppliers have been asked not to spread rumours that oxygen supplies are hampered. All the private hospitals are provided with oxygen supply as per their demand. It is also directed those private hospitals having minimum of 50 beds should reserve 10 beds for Covid,” read the statement from the administration. District magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey did not respond to calls and queries about the official figures of daily demand and supply, besides the issues being raised by the hospitals.  Shailendra Kumar Singh, additional district magistrate (city) and nodal officer looking after oxygen supplies in the district, said the co-ordination committee will look after the demand and supply of oxygen to private hospitals. “There is gap but we are trying to manage during the times when demand suddenly increases. We have also made arrangements so that in case oxygen stock goes down in one hospital, nearby hospitals will be able to arrange oxygen for immediate help. We are trying to maintain demand and supply in the district,” he said admitting that the demand and supply figures were not readily available.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/private-hospitals-grapple-with-limited-oxygen-supply-101619030325800.html
22-04-2021||Noida||Noida falls short on plasma, rarely any donors||Plasma banks in the city are running dry as very few donors have come forward, even as demand for the treatment is increasing.Plasma therapy involves removing antibody-containing plasma from the blood of a recently recovered Covid-19 patient and pumping it into a sick patient. Dr Satyam Arora, associate professor (research and transfusion medicine) at SSPHPGTI has been actively circulating messages and videos on social media to help encourage people to come forward to donate plasma. “In the past two weeks, the demand for plasma has surged heavily. However, there are barely any voluntary plasma donations. We receive over 10 requests from people looking for plasma but are able to fulfil the request of only 3 or 4 such people in a day. This is only after the attendant brings a donor of another blood group and then we exchange the plasma for the required blood group. Amidst this, there is nothing left for the bank as there are no voluntary plasma donations,” he said.Gautam Budh Nagar police commissionerate launched a plasma bank on April 18 and tied up with Child PGI hospital to act as a bridge between plasma donors and those who require it. However, since it launched, only five civilians have come forward to donate plasma while over 400 requests have been registered at its helpline.“While five civilians came forward to donate, we could only take plasma from four of them as one of them was ineligible. From the police force, five personnel have donated plasma. The numbers are low because the eligibility criteria is that they should be recovered between March-April and the number is low. However, we are still under process to screen more personnel who will be eligible to donate,” said Meenakshi Katyayan, DCP, Gautam Budh Nagar Police.She added that those who have recovered between January to end of March this year are eligible to donate plasma. Between January 15, 2021 (24952 total recoveries) and April 15, 2021 (25703 total recoveries), 751 patients from Gautam Buddh Nagar district have recovered from coronavirus.She added that currently 85 police personnel are infected with Covid-19 and the officials hope that once they recover, they will donate to the plasma bank.The situation is similar at Sharda Hospital in Greater Noida as well. As per officials, the plasma bank here has not had any voluntary plasma donations since January. “In the last two weeks, many of hospital doctors who had recovered from Covid ended up donating plasma to save lives of Covid patients,” said Dr Ajit Kumar, spokesperson from Sharda Hospital, Greater Noida.He added that the plasma banks are rendered empty as to treat Covid patients today, plasma is required from a patient who has recovered anywhere between January to April 1. “Since Covid cases were very less at that time, hence not many people are even eligible to donate. However we hope Covid patients that leave after recovering shall come back to donate after 15 days in order to help others recover,” he said.Manish Kumar, a resident of Greater Noida west who has been helping friends and family arrange plasma for Covid patients, said that many are not coming forward to donate because of a scare of Covid. “To donate plasma, a person has to spend over 2 hours at a hospital. These days with Covid cases rising and happening to those too who had it earlier, voluntary donations are becoming lesser and lesser,” he said.The medical community, however, is divided over the efficacy of the treatment.“A patient benefits from plasma therapy if the he/she requires oxygen and his/her duration of illness is less than 10 days. The idea of Plasma donation is that we are transferring readymade antibodies in a sick person who’s own body will take time to make its own,” said Dr Mrinal Sircar, Director - Pulmonology & Critical Care, Fortis Hospital, Noida.“Studies have shown that plasma therapy has a limited role and is not of much use,” Dr Randeep Guleria, director of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, had said earlier.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-falls-short-on-plasma-rarely-any-donors-101619030325145.html
22-04-2021||Patna||‘No beds,’ say packed Patna hospitals amid Covid-19 spike||Amid the surging Covid-19 cases, finding a bed in a hospital with oxygen facility is turning out to be an impossibility in Patna, which has four medical college hospitals, something few cities in the country can match, besides the private nursing homes, registered or unregistered.HT visited at least 15 hospitals and almost everywhere it found notices announcing “no beds” put up prominently.“I had to first buy an oxygen cylinder for ₹18,000 and then admit my husband to a private nursing home, as no nursing home was ready to admit him due to uncertainty of oxygen supply. One of them agreed on the condition that oxygen supply would be my concern. In the government hospitals, seats are only available for VVIPs,” said Kavita Srivastava, a resident of Friends Colony.Oxygen supply is a big concern for private hospitals. Kin of several patients are already weighing options of shifting them to Delhi. “You ask the government, and they say everything is fine, while the situation is so bad that even for a thermometer or a steam inhaler, one has to keep running from one medical shop to another, let alone oxygen,” said Ravish Kumar, a resident of Patna City area.Ravish Narayan (48), a Covid-19 patient and a resident of Danapur, had to face an even more harrowing ordeal. After his health deteriorated on Tuesday evening, his family rushed him to a leading hospital near their residence in Rajabazar area. Despite their pleas, they were advised to take him home. “There is no vacant bed, and he will be managed better at home,” they were told.As the night progressed, his condition worsened, with oxygen levels dipping to dangerous levels, leaving him gasping for every breath that he took. Their efforts to find “a bed with oxygen cylinder” also failed in hospitals. After hundreds of frantic phone calls to friends and beyond, Narayan was finally accommodated at a private hospital. Currently, he is struggling for life.The attendant of another patient said he had to cough up ₹54,000 for a Remdesivir injection. “I paid as I needed it. My doctor had asked for it. I was left with no choice but to pay. Remdesivir has become like liquor in dry Bihar. It is officially not available, but the black market provides the facility of home delivery. What I am saying is no hearsay. I have myself paid for it and I am thankful that the black market at least makes it available,” he says, not wishing to be identified.With the number of fresh Covid-19 cases creating a record each day, the situation is likely to aggravate further. AIIMS is the first choice for patients in Patna, but it has limited number of beds and VVIPs hardly leave enough space for common people.Rajabazar’s private hospital was packed to capacity on Wednesday when HT visited the facility. “There’s no bed at all,” a hospital employee on duty said. At AIIMS, patients and attendants were seen waiting for admission, without success.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/no-beds-say-packed-patna-hospitals-amid-covid-19-spike-101619030324593.html
22-04-2021||Noida||Denied test at Ghaziabad hospital, 65-year-old Delhi woman dies in ambulance||A 65-year-old woman from Delhi died in an ambulance at the MMG District Hospital on Wednesday afternoon after health care workers at the Sanjay Nagar combined district hospital told to go there for her Covid-19 test, her family alleged. The dead woman was identified as Sunita Kakkar, resident of Krishna Nagar. Sandeep Chaddha, her son-in-law who took her to Ghaziabad on Wednesday, said, “After not getting beds in Delhi on Tuesday, we turned to Ghaziabad and visited several hospitals but could not find a bed. We then reached the testing booth at Sanjay Nagar and the staff there asked us to go to MMG Hospital.” At MMG hospital, her sample was taken up around 12.15pm and she died around 12.30pm, he said. “Her oxygen supply in the ambulance had exhausted by then,” said Chaddha. “If the test would have been conducted at Sanjay Nagar booth, she would have been saved. Instead, we had to suffer traffic to reach MMG Hospital, which is about 5kms away. When her rapid antigen test report arrived, she tested positive for Covid.”Dr Sanjay Teotia, chief medical superintendent of Sanjay Nagar district hospital said that the testing booth staff, is attached to the office of the chief medical officer (CMO). CMO Dr NK Gupta said he will inquire into the incident. “We will get it inquired,” he added. The UP government recently issued directions on April 17 about “presumptive patients” and said that those having Covid-like symptoms but testing negative in reports, should be treated like Covid patients. When contacted, district magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey did not respond to calls and did not respond to detailed query sent to him about the issue. In another incident, a 62-year-old man from Vinod Nagar (East) in Delhi collapsed on a road in Vaishali on Monday evening after his son took him on a bike to hospitals in Ghaziabad in order to get him admitted. The state control room records indicated that the Ghaziabad district recorded a single day high of a total of eight deaths on Wednesday. With this, the overall tally of Covid-related deaths has gone up to 117. Overall 15 deaths have taken place so far in the month of April.“Of the eight deaths, two took place at Santosh Hospital while five took place at Rama Hospital. The patients were in critical condition. At our end, we are trying best to give treatment to patients,” CMO Dr NK Gupta, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/denied-test-at-ghaziabad-hospital-65-year-old-delhi-woman-dies-in-ambulance-101619030264179.html
22-04-2021||Pune||The challenge of managing a pet in a Covid-positive family||Families with pets who test positive for Covid-19 have no option but to drop their pet off at a home boarders’, a kennel or at pet hostels. Vandanaa Patwardhan Goswaamii, owner of Crazy Paws pet resort in Bavdhan, has been boarding pets of families that tested positive for Covid-19 since March 2020. “Since March last year, we have been boarding pets of families that tested positive and are in quarantine. Pet dogs do not spread the virus; however, families are unable to walk their pets while in quarantine, so we go and pick up the pet, following all protocols, and board their pets,” Goswaamii said. Savita Gadre and her husband tested positive and have a 1.5-year-old Pitbull. “We have a Pitbull named Lily, and we were really worried when we got our results. Luckily, when we had mild symptoms, I had spoken to a good friend who has a boarding facility. On informing her she was ready to extend her help and took Lily in. Our dog has always been very happy and comfortable with Crazy Paws,” Gadre said. Radhika Ghadge, another pet owner said that as soon as you have doubt about your health start keeping a distance from the rest of the family and pets. “When we had our family member test positive, it was impossible to give Smokey our dog any exercise as we were quarantined. Our usual pet sitter from Crazy Paws came like an angel to our rescue. She arranged a pickup for our dog in a very efficient and contactless way. For 15 days Smokey stayed with her, it was a blissful vacation for him, Ghadge says, adding, “She sent us regular updates, videos and photos of him so that we would not worry.” For most families with more than one Covid positive member, it is impossible to take care of their pet’s daily routine and in most societies even if one person is positive the whole family is put under quarantine. Riya Sayaji from Pets Hangover boarding and dog park has a dedicated driver or pet taxis for pick-up and drops. “We follow some precautionary steps when the pets check-in at a place, for example bathing them and cleaning their leash and collars. Though pets don’t spread Covid-19, the equipment could be contaminated,” said Sayaji, who operates in Koregaon Park Annexe with kennels in Ghorpadi and Undri.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/the-challenge-of-managing-a-pet-in-a-covid-positive-family-101619020063388.html

22-04-2021||Pune||Lockdown restrictions leave marketplaces overcrowded in Pune||Pune: On Wednesday, the first day of time restrictions for stores selling essential commodities in Pune – 7am to 11am - huge crowds were seen across the city trying to beat the deadline. This resulted in a massive rush at markets, grocery shops and at vegetable vendors. At the Mandai market, one of the major vegetable markets in Pune, people started crowding at 6am. At 9 am, there was such a huge crowd inside the market area that no proper social distancing was possible. “I had gone to buy some vegetables at Mandai market in the morning, when I saw the crowd, I returned. The decision of limiting the timing is leading to more rush,” said Kiran Pisal, a local resident. A similar situation was seen on the other main roads. In Hadapsar, at Gadital chowk citizens crowded to purchase groceries. Outside kirana shops, long queues were seen by 8am. Atul Namekar, secretary of the Sinhgad road-Warje residents association, said, “On Sinhagad road, from Rajaram bridge chowk till Bramha hotel chowk, the entire footpath is crowded with roadside vendors. People rushed to buy vegetables, groceries and other food items as if it was the last day before lockdown. By doing this they are risking their own and lives of others too, as there might be by many Covid positive patients or carriers amongst them.” “There was heavy rush on the Jambhulwadi road to buy household items and vegetables. The road had a traffic jam before 11am. Our demand is that this limitation should be removed immediately,” said Vaibhav Dhekane, executive president of Dattanagar Jambhulwadi road traders’ association.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/lockdown-restrictions-leave-marketplaces-crowded-in-pune-101619015203230.html
22-04-2021||Pune||Oxygen stock running out of breath in Pune||Pune: As the demand for oxygen increases in Pune, providing it to each hospital has become really challenging for the civic and district administration. The demand in Pune city and district is for 350 metric tonnes of oxygen per day and the current supply is at 315- 320 metric tonnes per day. Every day officials panic as least three to four phone calls are coming in, stating that oxygen supply has not reached. On Wednesday, oxygen at one of the hospitals in Chakan ran out and the authorities needed to shift patients to another hospital. Two days earlier, the same scenario unfolded at a Jumbo hospital in Shivajinagar. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) additional commissioner SB Patil is in charge for co-ordinating oxygen supply in the Pune city and district. He was unavailable for comment on the shortage.PMC officer Srinivas Kandul is coordinating oxygen supply to PMC hospitals and Covid centres. Kandul said, “Oxygen supply is really very tight. Every day there are crises at some hospital. PMC’s total demand for civic-body-run Covid centres is 42 metric tonnes and we are not getting oxygen as per demand. There is short of six metric tonnes, but we are managing.”Another officer, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said, “Due to social media, there is more panic. If oxygen levels came down in a specific hospital immediately the news is on social media, even if the demand is addressed. Then, the administration needs to address various calls to deal with the panic.”A doctor working at a government hospital, also speaking anonymously, said, “As the surge is very high and many patients are critical, oxygen demand increases all of a sudden. Now doctors need to keep in mind things like oxygen supply. This creates a greater burden on the medical fraternity as they need to handle the situation in the wards.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/oxygen-stock-running-out-of-breath-in-pune-101619014843147.html

There are three prisoners in Tihar, who do not share space with anyone, Shahabuddin being one. The other two are underworld gangster Chhota Rajan and Delhi gangster Neeraj Bawana. They are lodged alone in the most secure part of the prison. Even other prisoners do not interact with them. For the last 20-25 days, the bi-weekly family visits have also been suspended. So, the infection has happened inside only,” a senior prison officer, who did not wish to be named, said.Jail officers are now monitoring Rajan’s health because he may also have contact with the same jail officers. Rajan has co-morbidities, officials said. The three prisoners are lodged in three adjacent cells at a heavily guarded wing inside jail 2.The prison’s director general, Sandeep Goel, confirmed that the former parliamentarian had tested positive and was admitted to a city hospital but refused to disclose details related to the case.Tihar, which is the country’s largest prison complex and houses over 20,000 prisoners currently, has at least 115 active cases among prisoners. There are 14 Covid-positive jail officers too, which include the prison’s doctor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/jailed-gangster-turned-politician-shahabuddin-covid-ve-admitted-to-delhi-hospital-101618991624849.html
22-04-2021||World||Biden to propose capital gains tax as high as 43.4% for wealthy individuals||President Joe Biden will propose almost doubling the capital gains tax rate for wealthy individuals to 39.6%, which, coupled with an existing surtax on investment income, means that federal tax rates for investors could be as high as 43.4%, according to people familiar with the proposal.The plan would boost the capital gains rate to 39.6% for those earning $1 million or more, an increase from the current base rate of 20%, the people said on the condition of anonymity because the plan is not yet public. A 3.8% tax on investment income that funds Obamacare would be kept in place, pushing the tax rate on returns on financial assets higher than the top rate on wage and salary income, they said.Stocks slid on news about the plan, with the S&P 500 Index down as much as 0.6% after climbing 0.2% earlier. The Nasdaq Composite fell 0.4% as of 1:15 p.m. after rising as much as 0.5%. Ten-year Treasury yields erased gains.The proposal could reverse a long-standing provision of the tax code that taxes returns on investment lower than on labor. Biden campaigned on equalizing the capital gains and income tax rates for wealthy individuals, saying it’s unfair that many of them pay lower rates than middle-class workers.The White House and Treasury Department didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. Biden is expected to release the proposal next week as part of the tax increases to fund social spending in the forthcoming “American Families Plan.”For $1 million earners in high-tax states, rates on capital gains could be above 50%. For New Yorkers, the combined state and federal capital gains rate could be as high as 52.22%. For Californians, it could be 56.7%.Democrats have said current capital gains rates largely help top earners who get their income through investments rather than in the form of wages, resulting in lower tax rates for wealthy people than those they employ. Republicans argue that current capital gains rates encourage saving and promote future economic growth.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-to-propose-capital-gains-tax-as-high-as-43-4-for-wealthy-individuals-101619113482392.html

Ministers say any decision on declaring a genocide is up to the courts.So far the government has imposed sanctions on some Chinese officials and introduced rules to try to prevent goods linked to the region entering the supply chain, but a majority of lawmakers want ministers to go further.Beijing denies accusations of rights abuses in Xinjiang.Lawmakers backed a motion brought by Conservative lawmaker Nusrat Ghani stating Uighurs in Xinjiang were suffering crimes against humanity and genocide, and calling on government to use international law to bring it to an end.The support for the motion is non-binding, meaning it is up to the government to decide what action, if any, to take next.Britain's minister for Asia, Nigel Adams, again set out to parliament the government's position that any decision on describing the human rights abuses in Xinjiang as genocide would have to be taken by "competent" courts.Some lawmakers fear Britain risks falling out of step with allies over China after the Biden administration endorsed a determination by its predecessor that China had committed genocide in Xinjiang.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-parliament-declares-genocide-in-china-s-xinjiang-raises-pressure-on-johnson-101619111135369.html
22-04-2021||World||Pregnant women with Covid-19 have higher risks: Study||A multi-country study suggests pregnant women who get Covid-19 have higher risks for death, intensive-care stays, preterm birth and other complications.Pregnancy causes various changes in the body that may make women vulnerable to harm from the coronavirus. Pregnant women can gain some protection by getting vaccinated; recent evidence suggests the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines are safe to use in pregnancy.The results were published on Thursday in the Journal of the American Medical Association Pediatrics, which echo smaller studies. The research involved women in 18 countries, including the United States, Central and South America, Europe, Asia and Africa. The study involved about 700 pregnant women with Covid-19 and 1,400 without it. It was sponsored by a research fund at the University of Oxford, there the lead authors work.On Wednesday, the preliminary results of a report of 35,000 U.S. women who received either the Moderna or Pfizer shots while pregnant showed their rates of miscarriage, premature births and other complications were comparable to those observed in published reports on pregnant women before the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pregnant-women-with-covid-19-have-higher-risks-study-101619111583374.html
22-04-2021||World||US House passes bill to make Washington, D.C., the 51st state||The US House of Representatives on Thursday narrowly voted, for the second time in less than a year, to make the District of Columbia the 51st state, sending it to the Senate where it faces stiff Republican opposition.By a vote of 216-208, the Democratic-controlled House approved the initiative with no Republican support.The population of Washington, D.C., is heavily Democratic. As a state, it likely would elect two Democratic senators, potentially altering the balance of power in the Senate, which now has 50 Democrats and 50 Republicans.Democrats, who have been advocating statehood for the capital of the United States for decades, hope to take advantage of last November's election of President Joe Biden as well as control of the Senate and House to admit a new state for the first time since 1959, the year Alaska and Hawaii joined the union.Democrats argued statehood would fix a centuries-old wrong of "more than 700,000 Americans citizens who pay federal taxes, who fight and die in wars, who serve on our juries and yet have no vote in the Senate or the House of Representatives," said Democratic Representative Jan Schakowsky. "That is the definition of taxation without representation."The new state would be named "Washington, Douglass Commonwealth" after George Washington, the first US president, and Frederick Douglass, a former enslaved person who became a famous abolitionist.Republicans, accusing Democrats of a "power grab" to advance a "far-left" agenda, are expected to block the bill in the Senate, where 60 of 100 members need to agree to advance most legislation."This is about government-run healthcare, a $93 trillion Green New Deal, packing the Supreme Court, higher taxes and a bigger, less efficient form of government," said Republican Representative Nancy Mace during a spirited House debate.The House first passed this bill last June by a vote of 232-180. Republicans, who controlled the Senate then, refused to act on it.Statehood would also give Washington at least one House member. Its population of around 700,000 is more than that of the states of Wyoming and Vermont. About half of its residents are Black.Currently, Washington, D.C., has only one member of Congress - a House "delegate" who is not allowed to vote on legislation.If the city became a state it would maintain its three electoral votes, which are used in the presidential election process. States' electoral votes are based on population.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-house-passes-bill-to-make-washington-d-c-the-51st-state-101619111114359.html
22-04-2021||World||India to join search for missing Indonesian submarine||The Indian Navy on Thursday dispatched a deep submergence rescue vessel (DSRV) to help the Indonesian Navy with its search and rescue efforts for a submarine that went missing on April 21 with a crew of 53 personnel, the navy said. The Indonesian submarine Nanggala went missing north of Bali on Wednesday morning. India is the third country after Singapore and Malaysia to join the rescue effort, with the United States, Australia and France also making offers to help. “On 21 April, an alert was received by Indian Navy through International Submarine Escape and Rescue Liaison Office (ISMERLO), regarding the missing Indonesian submarine,” the Indian Navy said in a statement. The Indonesian Navy on Thursday said that the missing German-built submarine has enough oxygen for 72 hours during a power blackout.The Indian Navy’s DSRV system can locate a submarine up to 1,000 metres underwater using its modern side-scan sonar and remotely operated vehicle. “After the submarine is successfully located, another sub module of the DSRV --- the submarine rescue vehicle (SRV) --- mates with the submarine to rescue the trapped personnel. The SRV can also be used to provide emergency supplies to the submarine,” the statement added. India is among the few countries capable of undertaking search and rescue of a disabled submarine through a DSRV. Defence minister Rajnath Singh is in touch with his Indonesian counterpart. “Spoke to the Defence Minister of Indonesia, General Prabowo Subianto over the phone and shared my pain over the news of missing submarine Nanggala and its crew members. India is extending its full support to the ongoing Indonesian rescue efforts,” Singh tweeted on Thursday. The Indian DSRV, being ferried by offshore supply vessel Sabarmati, could take almost a week to reach the location, which is 2,500 nautical miles away, people familiar with the development said. India is looking at the possibility of using its air force for speedier assistance. Singh wrote on Twitter that he has tasked the Indian Air Force to examine the feasibility of induction of the DSRV intervention system by air. “Under the framework of comprehensive strategic partnership between India and Indonesia, Indian Navy and Indonesian Navy share a strong partnership of operational cooperation. The two navies have been exercising regularly in the past and have developed synergy and interoperability which is considered important for the present mission,” the navy statement said. The Indian Navy inducted its first DSRV in 2018 and the second one the following year. The vessels were delivered under a £193-million contract awarded to JFD, a Scotland-based leading underwater capability provider, in March 2016.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-to-join-search-for-missing-indonesian-submarine-101619103353159.html
22-04-2021||World||US weighs global Covid-19 vaccine-expansion move opposed by drugmakers||The Biden administration is weighing an appeal from progressive Democrats to accelerate global access to Covid-19 vaccines by supporting a waiver of intellectual-property protections, a move opposed by big drugmakers.Lawmakers led by senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren last week called on President Joe Biden to back a proposal before the World Trade Organization that seeks a broad waiver from obligations on the protection of intellectual property rights, including patents, copyrights and trade secrets.The aim is to ease rules regarding the production and export of vaccines and other critical medical goods needed to combat the Covid-19 virus.The lawmakers and allies including labor unions argue that supporting the plan -- backed by South Africa, India, and more than 50 other countries -- would save lives. The Trump administration blocked the proposal, first put forward in October. Failing to act on it would put drug company profits ahead of people, advocates say.​​U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai has indicated that the status quo isn’t an option, without committing to change or maintain the country’s stance at the WTO.In separate virtual meetings on April 13 with drugmakers and waiver-seeking groups, she said the administration wants to increase the production and distribution of vaccines. The next day at a WTO meeting, Tai said inequality in vaccine access is totally unacceptable and that the market has failed in meeting the health needs of developing countries, calling on nations to consider whether changes to the group’s rules might be needed.The U.S. isn’t the only country that has opposed a waiver; the European Union, U.K., Japan, Switzerland, Brazil and Norway also have resisted the push. The WTO is a consensus-based organization, meaning an objection from any one member can stop action. But waiver supporters argue that U.S. leadership on the issue could help to sway other holdouts.‘Critical’ Need“The waiver is critical to be able to increase global production of vaccines and treatments as soon as possible,” said Lori Wallach, director of the Global Trade Watch at Public Citizen, one of the groups lobbying for the measure.Public Citizen is pushing for the U.S. to support the waiver at a WTO General Council meeting starting May 5 and says backers have collected more than 2 million petition signatures urging Biden to take the step.Nations already have the power to issue compulsory licenses -- allowing them to make the vaccine without the patent holder’s permission, for a fee -- for homegrown manufacturing.But the proposal would let countries obtain know-how and negotiate deals to produce vaccines elsewhere without facing trade blowback from the U.S. and European Union, where most of the drugmakers are based.Business groups say the waiver plan is ineffective. They argue that few countries have the capacity to produce more vaccines even if they knew the formulas. Also, there’s limited global supply of the materials needed, and building new factories with the necessary technology to produce the vaccines could take years, they say.The move also could weaken a priority of decades of U.S. trade negotiations: strong protection for intellectual property, which drugmakers and other industries say helps maintain the U.S. technological lead.While the U.S. government contributed funding for Covid-19 vaccines and helped develop some of the foundational technology, companies had already been investing in developing the mRNA technology in Moderna Inc. and Pfizer Inc.’s vaccines for years beforehand.Of the shots administered globally so far, 39% have gone to people in 27 wealthy nations that represent 11% of the world population. Countries making up the least-wealthy 11% have gotten about 2% of inoculations, according to an analysis of data in the Bloomberg Vaccine Tracker.“The top priority of the United States is saving lives and ending the pandemic in the United States and around the world,” Adam Hodge, a USTR spokesman, said in response to a Bloomberg News inquiry about the U.S. position on the waiver. “Along with our investments in Covax, we are working with our global partners to explore pragmatic and effective steps to surge the production and equitable distribution of vaccines.”India has placed limits on exports of vaccines made within its borders amid a record number of infections. South Africa has said a shortage of jabs is undermining plans to vaccinate two-thirds of its population this year, and has blamed in part drugmakers who object to the waiver proposal.The pharmaceutical companies say they are working to expand global capacity already, and argue that the fastest way for the U.S. to help developing countries is by giving them the stockpile of vaccines it already has, like tens of millions of doses of the jab developed by AstraZeneca Plc, which hasn’t been approved for U.S. use.Wealthy countries “are stockpiling or blocking the shipment of vaccine doses, impeding their global distribution, and choosing to vaccinate their low-risk populations before focusing on higher-risk patients abroad,” Michelle McMurry-Heath, president of the industry group Biotechnology Innovation Organization, or BIO, said in a letter to Tai this week.After PandemicDrugmakers worry about being forced to turn over research they would use for other medicines that could be critical to their future after the pandemic ends.“You would have a couple of years where a patent isn’t enforceable, and then it is again,” Hans Sauer, BIO’s deputy general counsel, said in an interview. “But you can’t do that for trade secrets and data on biologic materials. You can’t un-disclose a trade secret.”Republican Senator Thom Tillis wrote to Tai last week urging opposition to the waiver, saying it would be “disastrous” and put China and India in a position to demand the transfer of mRNA technology from the U.S., giving industries in those nations a free boost to compete against American companies and workers.Then there’s concern about safety and the possibility that a lack of regulation for production could lead to mistakes in the process, creating chaos and undermining confidence in immunization.While it’s no panacea, a waiver “moves things in the right direction,” said James Love, director of Knowledge Ecology International, which advises the UN and governments on health issues.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-weighs-global-covid-19-vaccine-expansion-move-opposed-by-drugmakers-101619100562351.html
22-04-2021||World||US jobless claims fall to 547,000, another pandemic low||The number of Americans applying for unemployment aid fell last week to 547,000, the lowest point since the pandemic struck and an encouraging sign that layoffs are slowing on the strength of an improving job market.The Labor Department said Thursday that applications declined 39,000 from a revised 586,000 a week earlier. Weekly jobless claims are down sharply from a peak of 900,000 in early January. At the same time, they're still far above the roughly 230,000 level that prevailed before the viral outbreak ripped through the economy in March of last year.“With 135 million Americans having received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccination and the economy opening up more each day, the number of job opportunities will continue to rise,” said James Knightley, chief international economist at ING, a European bank.About 17.4 million people were continuing to collect unemployment benefits in the week that ended April 3, up from 16.9 million in the previous week. Most of the increase occurred in two states, California and Texas, which process their claims every other week. In California, recipients of a federal program for the long-term unemployed jumped nearly 50%, a sign that the state likely processed a backlog of claims that had been filed earlier.Still, the number of ongoing recipients has declined by about 2.3 million from early March, when the figure was 19.7 million, evidence that more people are being hired. Some long-term unemployed may have also exhausted all their benefits.The overall job market has been making steady gains. Last month, the nation's employers added 916,000 jobs, the most since August, in a sign that a sustained recovery is taking hold. The unemployment rate fell from 6.2% to 6%, well below the pandemic peak of nearly 15%.The number of available jobs has also jumped in recent weeks, leading many employers to complain that they can't find enough workers despite still-high unemployment. Several factors may be keeping some of those out of work from searching for jobs. They include fears of contracting the virus, child care needs and the fact that a federal supplemental unemployment benefit of $300 a week, on top of state aid, means that some low-income workers can receive as much or more income from jobless benefits compared with their former job's pay.The weekly data on applications for jobless aid is generally seen as a rough measure of layoffs because only people who have lost their jobs through no fault of their own are eligible. But during the pandemic, the numbers have become a less reliable barometer.States have struggled to clear backlogs of unemployment applications, and suspected fraud has clouded the actual volume of job cuts. In addition, the supplemental federal jobless payment, on top of regular state unemployment aid, might have encouraged more people to apply for benefits.For now, the economy is showing steady signs of recovering. Sales at retail stores and restaurants soared 10% in March — the biggest increase since last May. Federal stimulus checks of $1,400 have been sent to most adults. And Americans who have kept their jobs have accumulated additional savings, part of which they will likely spend now that states and cities have loosened business restrictions and the virus wanes.Economic growth is accelerating so fast that the principal concerns surrounding the economy have shifted from a high unemployment rate and anemic spending to bottlenecks in company supply chains and the difficulty some businesses say they are having in finding enough workers.Those issues, in turn, have fed concerns that the Federal Reserve’s low-interest rate policies could fuel a spike in inflation. Last month, wholesale prices jumped 4.2% compared with a year earlier, the biggest 12-month increase in nearly a decade.Still, consumer prices are, so far, rising at a more restrained pace. They increased 2.6% in March from a year earlier, mostly because of a jump in gas prices. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core inflation rose just 1.6% in the previous 12 months.Economists expect inflation to rise steadily in the coming months because prices fell about a year ago when the pandemic first hit and the economy largely shut down. That makes comparisons to price levels a year ago look particularly large.Fed Chair Jerome Powell says he expects that higher inflation to prove temporary and that supply bottlenecks will eventually clear as shipping picks up and factories produce more parts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-jobless-claims-fall-to-547-000-another-pandemic-low-101619100781316.html
22-04-2021||World||Europe takes steps to reopen as Covid-19 vaccinations ramp up||Western Europe is beginning to loosen restrictions to contain the coronavirus, offering relief for the pandemic-weary region as vaccination programs turn the corner.Italy will ease many restrictions on Monday, Greece will follow suit in early May, and Germany is mulling privileges for people who have been immunized. Later on Thursday, French Prime Minister Jean Castex will announce the next steps for the country amid plans to lift some restrictions on travel and outdoor dining.After a slow start to inoculation programs, Western Europe is starting to see progress in protecting its people against Covid-19, which has caused more than 640,000 deaths across the continent.As supplies increase, Germany may be in a position to lift vaccination prioritization by June, a step that would open access to all adults, according to Health Minister Jens Spahn.“If it’s earlier than that, then I will be pleased but we shouldn’t raise expectations,” Spahn said in a speech to the upper house of parliament on Thursday.As the pace of contagion slows in Italy, Prime Minister Mario Draghi’s government is restoring free travel between moderate-risk regions, and people can go to more at-risk areas under certain conditions, including a pass certifying vaccination. Bars and restaurants will also be allowed to open outdoor areas, according to the new rules.In France, curbs on inter-regional travel will be lifted on May 3, four weeks after they were announced by President Emmanuel Macron. But a curfew between 7 p.m. and 6 a.m. will remain in place, a government spokesman said ahead of Castex’s address.Greece will ease its main pandemic restrictions -- including allowing outdoor dining -- in early May, ahead of the country’s opening to international travel in the middle of the month, Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said on Wednesday. Tourism is one of the country’s most important industries, accounting for about a fifth of the economy and more than a quarter of jobs.To accelerate immunizations, Greece will start administering unused doses of AstraZeneca Plc’s vaccine to people between 30 and 39 years old.To be sure, the situation remains tense. In Germany, Chancellor Angela Merkel secured passage of a controversial law on Thursday, which triggers tighter restrictions in virus hot spots, including nighttime curfews and closing schools and non-essential stores.While Germany’s contagion rate has stabilized in recent days, it’s still well-above levels the government has determined to be manageable and the number of patients in intensive-care facilities continues to rise.Vaccine progress also varies widely across the continent, casting doubt over the timing of reopening in some countries, especially in the east.While the island nation of Malta has already administered 67 doses per 100 adults, Bulgaria is only at 11 doses per 100. The average for the whole EU is 31.6, with countries including Hungary, Estonia and Denmark leading the push, and Latvia and Croatia among those lagging behind.“Without a doubt, there’s light at the end of the tunnel,” Merkel said in a speech on Thursday. “And it will get lighter in the summer, but we’re still stuck in the tunnel.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/europe-takes-steps-to-reopen-as-covid-19-vaccinations-ramp-up-101619099769329.html
22-04-2021||World||Hong Kong journalist convicted for accessing public records||A Hong Kong journalist was found guilty on Thursday of making false statements in obtaining information for an investigation into an attack on anti-government protesters, in the latest blow to press freedom in the city as authorities continue their crackdown on dissent.Choy Yuk-ling, also known as Bao Choy, was arrested in November on charges of falsely declaring why she was obtaining license plate information from a publicly accessible database. She was attempting to track down the perpetrators of a violent attack by a mob of white-clad men on protesters in a subway station in 2019 for an investigative documentary for public broadcaster RTHK.Principal Magistrate Ivy Chui said the Road Traffic Ordinance only allows the public to obtain vehicle ownership records for transport or traffic-related matters, legal matters, or for vehicle purchases.She said Choy declared in her online application that she would use the information for “other traffic and transport related issues.” The application does not provide an option for journalistic research.Choy, a freelancer affiliated with RTHK, pleaded not guilty. She was convicted on two counts of making false statements and fined 6,000 Hong Kong dollars ($775).The documentary Choy was working on, titled “7.21 Who Owns the Truth,” also explored the behavior of Hong Kong police during last year’s anti-government protests. Police were accused of not intervening during the attack in the subway station in Yuen Long, a town in Hong Kong's New Territories.“Today is a very dark day for all journalists in Hong Kong,” Choy said after the verdict. “Today is not just a verdict or ruling on me personally but a ruling on journalism in Hong Kong and a ruling on all journalists in Hong Kong.”She described the outcome as “heartbreaking” and wiped away tears as she addressed reporters and her supporters.“The ruling of the court today is very harsh,” she said. “They interpreted the search of public data in the most narrow perspective which has restricted the free flow of information in Hong Kong.”She urged journalists to continue doing what they can to safeguard the values of a free press.Supporters chanted “Journalism is not a crime” and “Stand with Bao Choy” as they held up placards in support of her and freedom of the press.Chris Yeung, chairman of the Hong Kong Journalists Association, said Choy's use of a vehicle search to find out more about the attack demonstrates the media’s role as a watchdog.“The relentless efforts of journalists to find out the whole truth of the Yuen Long attacks could clarify who should hold responsibility for what in the incident. This is what the fourth power is about,” Yeung said after the verdict.“The government sent a reporter to the dock, she was found guilty and the fourth power is under threat. Press freedom in Hong Kong is dying,” he said.Media groups have expressed concern that the crackdown on freedoms in Hong Kong, including the implementation of a tough new national security law, could be used against journalists reporting on sensitive issues.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-journalist-convicted-for-accessing-public-records-101619096131455.html
22-04-2021||World||German upper house backs new law to fight third coronavirus wave||Germany's upper house of parliament approved a law on Thursday to give Chancellor Angela Merkel's government more powers to fight a third wave of the coronavirus.The new law enables the national government to impose curfews between 10 p.m. and 5 a.m., as well as limits on private gatherings, sport and shop openings. Schools will close and return to online lessons if the virus incidence exceeds 165 cases per 100,000 residents.The law still needs the signature of President Frank-Walter Steinmeier before it can come into force. The changes will apply initially until June 30.Merkel drew up the law after some of Germany's 16 federal states refused to impose tough measures despite a surge in cases.Manuela Schwesig, premier of the northern state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, said the amendment did not go far enough. "This law has a serious design flaw. This law will not bring down infection figures," she told ZDF television.Germany reported a rise of 29,518 coronavirus cases on Thursday, bringing the total to 3.21 million. Some 80,893 people have died and doctors have warned that unless action is taken, intensive-care units may struggle to cope.The seven-day incidence rate rose slightly to 161.1 per 100,000.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/german-upper-house-backs-new-law-to-fight-third-coronavirus-wave-101619095650223.html
22-04-2021||World||Norway lends AstraZeneca vaccine doses to Sweden, Iceland||Norway will lend all of its 216,000 doses of AstraZeneca to neighboring Sweden and Iceland as long as its own government regulator has paused the use of the vaccine.On March 11, Norway followed Denmark in deciding to put on hold jabs by the British-Swedish company after reports of very rare blood clots.Health Minister Bent Hoeie said if the use of the AstraZeneca vaccine is resumed, “we will get back the doses we lend as soon as we request it.”The European Medicines Agency has said the benefits of being immunized against Covid-19 outweigh the very rare risks of developing the unusual clots with AstraZeneca.Hoie also said if the vaccine is taken out of the coronavirus vaccination program in non-European Union-member Norway, “the doses we have been given can be donated to other countries in collaboration with the EU.”Hoeie said Sweden will borrow 200,000 doses and Iceland 16,000 doses. The Norwegian doses expire in June and July.The Danes, who were the first to pull suspend use of the AstraZeneca vaccine, have not yet decided what will happen with their doses.Although the Norwegian Institute of Public Health has called for removing the AstraZeneca vaccine from Norway’s vaccination program, the government in Norway this month decided to wait, saying it "believes that we do not have a good enough basis for drawing a final conclusion.”Hoeie reiterated that experts in Norway would gauge the use of the AstraZeneca and the Johnson & Johnson vaccine before May 10. Both vaccines are made with the same technology.Norway started its vaccinations on Dec. 27 and 1.1 million people — out of a population of 5.3 million -- have so far been vaccinated. Norway uses the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/norway-lends-astrazeneca-vaccine-doses-to-sweden-iceland-101619094741300.html
22-04-2021||World||EU looks to pursue legal action against AstraZeneca for underdelivering doses||The European Commission is looking to launch legal action against AstraZeneca for underdelivering Covid-19 vaccine doses to the EU, hobbling the bloc's early rollout of jabs, diplomats said Thursday.The EU executive informed member state envoys of its plans on Wednesday, the diplomats told AFP, confirming information first published by the Politico website.They said any lawsuit against AstraZeneca would begin in a Belgian court -- the jurisdiction agreed under the commission's contract with the British-Swedish pharmaceutical company.A commission spokesman, Eric Mamer, told journalists that "no decision has yet been taken".Another spokesman, Stefan De Keersmaecker, added: "As you know, AstraZeneca is not delivering the number of doses which have been agreed upon in the contract... This is one of the reasons why we keep our options open together with member states to take any further steps."One EU diplomat said the commission wants EU member states -- which also had a role in negotiating the vaccine contracts for the bloc -- to back the lawsuit and to say so by the end of this week."The problem is that the member states do not know the complaint" being formulated, the diplomat said. "It is a sensitive procedure and you do not want to further damage trust in the vaccine."Anther diplomat said that "not all member states are in agreement" on taking the company to court, stressing that their aim was simply to have AstraZeneca deliver the doses it had promised in its contract.AstraZeneca has so far delivered just 31 million of the 120 million doses it had promised. It has warned it will likewise provide just 70 million of the 180 million more meant to be delivered over the rest of this year.Public confidence in the AstraZeneca jab has taken a blow after the European Medicines Agency, the bloc's regulator, said it was likely linked to a very rare, but often fatal, form of blood clots affecting the brain.The EMA and the commission have not changed their stance on a general use of AstraZeneca, saying its benefits outweighed the risks, but several EU countries have restricted it to older citizens, aged over 50, 55 or 60.'Best efforts' AstraZeneca's French-Australian boss, Pascal Soriot, has argued that his company's contract with the EU binds it only to a "best reasonable efforts" clause.But the commission says the rest of the contract shows greater legal responsibility than that, and EU diplomats and lawmakers have pointed out that the company has largely delivered promised doses to Britain, where it is headquartered.A Brussels lawyer who has studied the AstraZeneca contract, Arnaud Jansen of the firm De Bandt, told AFP that, if any legal action was to go ahead, "it's a process that could take months" before a court rules on it||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-looks-to-pursue-legal-action-against-astrazeneca-for-underdelivering-doses-101619092268031.html
22-04-2021||World||China: We’re ready to provide outbreak-control help to India||China on Thursday said it was ready to provide outbreak prevention support and medical supplies to India as the country faces a vicious second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, putting its health infrastructure under severe strain.India reported 314,835 new coronavirus cases in the last 24 hours, the highest single-day tally recorded anywhere in the world since the pandemic started last year. India’s death toll from the disease rose 2,104 in the same time period.India’s tally of confirmed cases is now nearly 16 million, second only to America’s count of almost 32 million, according to the US-based Johns Hopkins University’s Covid-19 tracker. Responding to a query from Chinese state media on Thursday on the pandemic situation in India, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said Beijing was ready to help.“The Covid-19 epidemic is the common enemy of all mankind. The international community needs to unite as one to fight against the epidemic,” Wang said.“The Chinese side notes that the epidemic situation in India is severe and there is a temporary shortage of epidemic prevention and medical supplies. We are ready to provide necessary support and assistance to India so that they can control the epidemic,” Wang added.It could not be immediately ascertained if Beijing has officially extended the offer of help to New Delhi.HT learnt that while Indian private companies have been trying to source supplies from China, they have been hit by a sudden escalation of air freight costs over the last few days. Last year, India was among the countries to help Beijing with medical supplies during the time the Covid-19 outbreak was at its most severe in China.India had provided 15 tonnes of medical supplies comprising masks, gloves and emergency medical equipment at a cost of about ₹2.11 crore to China at that time.In a written reply to a question in the Lok Sabha in March last year, external affairs minister of state V Muraleedharan had said the medical supplies included 100,000 surgical masks, 500,000 pairs of surgical gloves, 4,000 N-95 masks, 75 infusion pumps, 30 enteral feeding pumps, and 21 defibrillators.The supplies, flown to China in an India Air Force C-17 flight, were handed over to a Hubei charity federation in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the first epicentre of the pandemic where the virus had emerged in December 2019.In February 2020, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi had written to President Xi Jinping, extending New Delhi’s assistance to fight the outbreak.Soon after, China’s ambassador to India Sun Weidong had appreciated the support and solidarity that India had extended to China in its fight against the coronavirus.China had returned the favour in April, dispatching dozens of aircraft with Covid-related medical supplies when the first wave of the pandemic became severe in India.India-bound flights had taken off from Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Xi’an and Hong Kong, carrying 390 tonnes of medical supplies.Soon after, however, ties plunged to its worst in decades following military friction along the disputed border in eastern Ladakh. Nearly a year later, the two countries are still grappling to completely defuse the situation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-we-re-ready-to-provide-outbreak-control-help-to-india-101619089910441.html
22-04-2021||World||US pledges to halve its emissions by 2030 in renewed climate fight||The Biden administration on Thursday pledged to slash U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by 50%-52% from 2005 levels by 2030, a new target it hopes will spur other big emitter countries to raise their ambition to combat climate change.The goal, unveiled at the start of a two-day climate summit hosted by Democratic President Joe Biden, comes as the United States seeks to reclaim global leadership in the fight against global warming after former President Donald Trump withdrew the country from international efforts to cut emissions.It also marks an important milestone in Biden's broader plan to decarbonize the U.S. economy entirely by 2050 - an agenda he says can create millions of good-paying jobs but which many Republicans say they fear will damage the economy.The emissions cuts are expected to come from power plants, automobiles, and other sectors across the economy, but the White House did not set individual targets for those industries."It's an economy-wide goal. There are going to be multiple pathways to get there," one official told reporters on a conference call describing the plan.Sector-specific goals will be laid out later this year.How the United States intends to reach its climate goals will be crucial to cementing U.S. credibility on global warming, amid international concerns that America's commitment to a clean energy economy can shift drastically from one administration to the next.Biden's recently introduced $2 trillion infrastructure plan contains numerous measures that could deliver some of the emissions cuts needed this decade, including a clean energy standard to achieve net zero emissions in the power sector by 2035 and moves to electrify the vehicle fleet.But the measures need to be passed by Congress before becoming reality.Biden focused on restoring U.S. climate leadership during his campaign and in the first days of his presidency after Republican Trump, a climate change skeptic, removed the United States from the Paris agreement on global warming.The new administration has come under heavy pressure from environmental groups, some corporate leaders, the UN secretary general and foreign governments to set a target to cut emissions by at least 50% this decade to encourage other countries to set their own ambitious emissions goals.Biden will announce the number at the start of a climate summit on Thursday that will be attended by leaders from the world's biggest emitters, including China.World leaders aim to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, a threshold scientists say can prevent the worst impacts of climate change.One of the administration officials said with the new U.S. target, enhanced commitments from Japan and Canada, and prior targets from the European Union and Britain, countries accounting for more than half the world's economy were now committed to reductions to achieve the 1.5 degrees Celsius goal."When we close this summit on Friday, we will unmistakably communicate ... the U.S. is back," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-pledges-to-halve-its-emissions-by-2030-in-renewed-climate-fight-101619086924257.html
22-04-2021||World||UK's Heathrow Airport refuses to allow extra flights from India amid Covid-19||Heathrow Airport in London, the UK's largest and busiest airport, has declined requests from at least four international aircraft carriers to land eight extra flights from India on Thursday, ahead of the coronavirus pandemic "red list" travel ban which comes into force from Friday.The airport said the decision to decline requests for additional flights was taken to ensure that the existing pressures on the border are not "exacerbated", resulting in long queues and crowds at passport control on arrival.India's addition to the travel "red list" was announced in the House of Commons earlier this week amid 103 cases recorded in the UK of a new variant of coronavirus first detected in India. Health Secretary Matt Hancock told MPs that the decision had been made after studying the data and on a “precautionary basis”."That means that anyone who is not a UK or Irish resident or a British citizen cannot enter the UK if they have been in India in the previous 10 days. UK and Irish residents and British citizens who have been in India in the 10 days before their arrival will need to complete hotel quarantine for 10 days from the time of arrival,” said Hancock.It has since triggered considerable confusion and panic as hundreds of Indian students and other UK-based British Indians scramble for return flights ahead of the Friday deadline. London-based family-owned travel agency, Tickets to India, is among the agents who have been working round the clock to try and sort out charter flights to carry Indian-origin passengers back to the UK."Hundreds of British nationals are still requesting seats but there is very little time to arrange a second charter before Friday," said the company, which was working on getting clearance for one Qatar Airways A350 to bring 300 passengers back before the cut-off time (4am local time) on Friday.The UK Civil Aviation Authority said it had received several applications for charter flight permits from India to the UK, but many have been declined or withdrawn as they did not meet the qualifying criteria."We are in a global health pandemic – people should not be travelling unless absolutely necessary," a UK government spokesperson said."Every essential check helps avoid the risk of importing dangerous variants of coronavirus which could put our vaccine rollout at risk," the spokesperson said.Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who was forced to cancel his India visit due to the surging coronavirus cases in India, told a Downing Street briefing earlier this week that the so-called "Indian variant" is still a variant under investigation, not a "variant of concern" as Public Health England (PHE) and other authorities continue to investigate its transmissibility and any vaccine resistance.A briefing document drawn up by PHE officials shows that between March 25 and April 7, a total of 3,345 arrivals from India were registered in UK border travel data, being collected through compulsory passenger locator forms at the airport. Of the arrivals so far 161 – or 4.8 per cent – tested positive for COVID-19 after a PCR test.The travel ban means that those with valid residency rights returning to the UK after the deadline on Friday face the additional financial burden of compulsory hotel quarantine and tests costs, estimated at around 2,000 pounds per person.The National Indian Students and Alumni Union UK (NISAU-UK), a representative group for Indian students in the UK, has been working on trying to seek some reprieve for Indian students from the additional and unforeseen financial burden."Significant concern is being raised about the cost of quarantine as well as how the new restrictions impact student eligibility for the Graduate visa route for which they need to be in the country by particular dates,” said NISAU UK chair Sanam Arora.The Home Office had already extended the deadline period for the physical campus presence requirements for students to be able to apply for the new Graduate or post-study work visa until June-end and a further extension is reportedly being considered.Meanwhile, the government has indicated that students with valid visas but yet to collect their biometric residence permits (BRPs) would qualify for entry, subject to all the additional quarantine rules.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uks-heathrow-airport-refuses-to-allow-extra-flights-from-india-amid-covid19-101619086610131.html
22-04-2021||World||Singapore quarantines hundreds after dorm workers infected with coronavirus||Singapore has discovered more virus cases in a foreign worker dormitory that was within the epicenter for the Covid-19 outbreak in the country last year, raising concerns about reinfections as almost all the laborers had previously tested positive.To stop the potential spread at the Westlite Woodlands dorm, more than 1,100 people living in the same block as the infected workers were recalled from work and will be sent to a government quarantine facility for 14 days, according to a letter, signed by the dormitory’s manager to clients on Wednesday, that was seen by Bloomberg News.“The situation is still unfolding,” the dormitory’s operator, Centurion Corp. Ltd, said in a statement on Thursday, declining to provide further detail or confirmation on the number of residents who have tested positive for Covid-19. The firm confirmed the authenticity of the letter.Earlier in the week, the government said a 35-year-old Bangladeshi migrant worker staying at the dormitory tested positive for the virus, despite having received both doses of vaccine. This prompted the government to isolate and quarantine his close contacts at the dorm and workplace.In a statement from the manpower ministry on Thursday, it said one person under quarantine, who is a roommate of the 35-year-old worker, was found to be infected. Virus testing was then conducted on all residents at the dormitory as a precaution. So far, 17 recovered workers were tested positive, the health ministry said in its daily preliminary virus update.The health ministry, “together with an expert panel which comprises infectious diseases and microbiology experts, is investigating if they are re-infection cases,” it said Thursday.This development comes after many weeks of almost zero new cases among the laborers and thousands of them getting vaccinations. The dormitory, located on the far north side of Singapore, first reported a cluster of virus cases in April last year but this cluster was closed in October after no new cases were found there for 28 days.Reinfection ConcernsLast year, Singapore confined hundreds of thousands of workers to their dormitories to prevent an outbreak in their ranks from spreading across the island. Though Singapore has largely managed to control the pandemic, and has one of the fastest vaccination rates in Asia-Pacific, concerns of reinfection are growing as new virus variants emerge and global cases tick up.Singapore is reviewing border controls for travelers who recovered from the virus. The country and Hong Kong called off an announcement planned for Thursday on an air-travel bubble, according to people familiar with the matter, the second time in five months the highly anticipated arrangement for quarantine-free travel between the two financial hubs has run into obstacles.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/singapore-quarantines-hundreds-after-dorm-workers-infected-with-coronavirus-101619083458182.html
22-04-2021||World||New Zealand says Five Eyes security alliance remains strong||New Zealand said Thursday it continues to have a close and productive relationship with the US and other security allies, despite resisting speaking out in unison with them against China on certain human rights issues.New Zealand Foreign Minister Nanaia Mahuta discussed her reluctance to expand the role of the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing alliance to include stances on human rights. The alliance among New Zealand, the US, the UK, Australia and Canada dates to World War II.Some observers have speculated that the differing approaches have exposed cracks in the alliance and that New Zealand is not being tough enough with China.Last year, for instance, New Zealand declined to sign a joint declaration by the other Five Eyes members condemning China's national security legislation in Hong Kong. New Zealand did, however, separately express its concerns.Mahuta's comments Thursday came after she met with her Australian counterpart Marise Payne at the first high-level summit since the two countries opened a quarantine-free travel bubble this week. The meeting came ahead of a planned visit by Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison next month.Mahuta said New Zealand values the Five Eyes relationship and receives significant benefits from it. But she said Five Eyes was about security and intelligence.“And it's not necessary all the time on every issue to invoke Five Eyes as your first port-of-call in terms of creating a coalition of support around particular issues, in the human rights space, for example,” Mahuta said.Payne said that as liberal democracies, the Five Eyes partners shared many common values and approaches to international issues through an era of greater strategic competition in the region.She said countries would choose to address issues of concern in whichever forum they found appropriate, but that the respect among the Five Eyes partners remained “enduring and continuing."Payne said Australia continued to pursue cooperation with China when it was in Australia's interests.“But we also have to acknowledge that China's outlook, and the nature of China's external engagement, both in our region and the world, has changed in recent years.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-zealand-says-five-eyes-security-alliance-remains-strong-101619083133949.html
22-04-2021||World||Pakistan Taliban claim responsibility for deadly blast at Serena hotel||The Pakistan Taliban claimed responsibility Thursday for a deadly bomb blast at a luxury hotel hosting the Chinese ambassador in the southwest of the country, as officials raised the death toll to five.Beijing said it strongly condemned the attack, although the Taliban said Pakistan security officials were the target of the blast.The bomb was placed in a car parked at the Serena hotel -- part of a five-star chain popular with diplomats -- and detonated late Wednesday in the city of Quetta, capital of Balochistan province.Pakistan is fighting several low-level insurgencies in the impoverished province waged by Islamist, separatist and sectarian groups."The suicide bomber hit the security officials exactly as it was planned," the spokesperson for Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) said in a statement.Police said the blast came from an improvised explosive device, and security officials and hotel staff were among those killed.Describing the blast as a "terrorist attack", China's foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said in Beijing that the Chinese delegation was not present when the bomb detonated.Gu Wenliang, agriculture commissioner at China's embassy in Pakistan, told the Chinese newspaper Global Times that the bomb had detonated 10 minutes before their expected return."I was walking through the car park when I heard a sudden loud sound and the earth shook under my feet," said Khuda Baksh, a guard at the hotel."Everyone was running for their lives before I lost consciousness", he told AFP.For years the TTP unleashed deadly attacks on urban centres across Pakistan from their bases along the Afghan border, where they provided shelter to an array of global jihadist groups including Al Qaeda.But a massive military offensive launched in 2014 largely destroyed the group's command and control structure, dramatically reducing insurgent violence throughout Pakistan.'Full alert'Wednesday's attack comes after extremist-linked violence has largely reduced in recent years."We will not allow this monster to re-emerge," tweeted Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan."We are on full alert and keeping an eye on all internal and external threats."Analysts warn, however, that Pakistan has yet to tackle the root causes of extremism.Balochistan is Pakistan's largest and poorest province despite being rich in natural resources.Resentment has been fuelled by billions of dollars of Chinese money flowing into the region through the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) -- a key part of China's Belt and Road Initiative -- which locals say gave them little benefit as most new jobs went to outsiders.In 2019 gunmen stormed a luxury hotel overlooking a flagship CPEC project -- the deep-water seaport in Gwadar that gives China strategic access to the Arabian Sea -- killing at least eight people.And in June, Baloch insurgents targeted the Pakistan Stock Exchange, which is partly owned by Chinese companies.Both attacks were claimed by the Balochistan Liberation Army.Wednesday's blast also comes after the radical anti-blasphemy Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) held a week of violent protests calling for the French ambassador to be kicked out of the country.The TLP has waged a campaign for months after President Emmanuel Macron defended the right of a satirical magazine to republish cartoons depicting the Prophet Mohammed -- an act deemed blasphemous by many Muslims.The TTP, though not ideologically linked to the TLP, published a statement earlier this week supporting the group's protests.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-taliban-claim-responsibility-for-deadly-blast-at-serena-hotel-101619083038963.html
22-04-2021||World||'Poisoned mutual trust': China tells Australia after it scraps BRI deal||China on Thursday said Australia's sudden scrapping of a Belt and Road Initiative deal risked "serious harm" to relations and warned of retaliatory actions, but Canberra insisted it would not be bullied.The federal government pulled the deal with Victoria state late Wednesday in a move justified by the defence minister as necessary to prevent Australia hosting a giant infrastructure scheme "used for propaganda".Australia overruled the state's decision to join the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) -- the flagship of President Xi Jinping's geostrategic vision for the Asia-Pacific region -- by saying the agreement was inconsistent with Australia's foreign policy.As relations nosedive -- following spats over the origins of the coronavirus and Canberra's blocking of Chinese telecoms giant Huawei -- Defence Minister Peter Dutton said Canberra was "worried" about local governments entering into such agreements with Beijing."We can't allow these sort of compacts... to pop up because they're used for propaganda reasons and we're just not going to allow that to happen," he told local radio.Dutton said the government's problem was not with the Chinese people but rather "the values or virtues or the outlook of the Chinese Communist Party".Australia last year enacted new powers -- widely seen as targeting China -- that allow it to scrap any agreements between state authorities and foreign countries deemed to threaten the national interest.Canberra's first target was the BRI, a vast network of investments that critics say is cover for Beijing to create geopolitical and financial leverage.Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the decision "followed through" on his government's pledge to ensure Australia had a consistent foreign policy which strives for a "world that seeks a balance in favour of freedom".The schism between Australia and its largest export market widened on Thursday as Beijing railed at the abrupt cancellation and warned it would damage trust between the two countries.The move "has poisoned mutual trust... and seriously harms China-Australia relations", said foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin at a briefing in Beijing."China reserves the right to take further action in response to this."Earlier, Dutton said he would be "very disappointed" if China retaliated but retorted that Australia "won't be bullied by anyone"."We are going to stand up for what we believe in and that's exactly what we've done here," he said.'Fraying relations'The BRI is the showpiece of Xi's vision for Asia, a lattice of ports, train tracks, economic zones and other infrastructure investments to tether the continent and beyond tighter into China's commercial orbit.It was unclear if the Victoria state deal had "any projects that were in the pipeline or whether any investments had been pledged", Peter Cai, a specialist on Australia-China relations at the Lowy Institute, told AFP.But Canberra's bold move is an indicator "of how fraying foreign relations or political instability can affect China's global infrastructure push", he said.China has already slapped tariffs on more than a dozen Australian industries, including wine, barley and coal, in what many see as punishment for Canberra's increasingly assertive stance against its largest trading partner.Australia infuriated China by calling for an independent probe into the origins of the coronavirus pandemic, banning controversial telecoms giant Huawei from building Australia's 5G network and tightening foreign investment laws for corporations.Other agreements between foreign powers and local governments are still under consideration, and Canberra could yet target the presence of Chinese government-backed Confucius Institutes at Australia's public universities.Critics say the institutes, which have been the subject of controversy on some campuses, promote the Communist Party's self-serving version of Chinese culture and history.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/poisoned-mutual-trust-china-tells-australia-after-it-scraps-bri-deal-101619082210328.html

22-04-2021||World||French president Macron's job is on the line and these are main contenders||In exactly 12 months time, the French will start the process of deciding whether they want to keep Emmanuel Macron as president, or dismiss him.The 43-year-old former investment banker-turned-president has been bruised by his government’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic, rallies against police violence and strikes against his pension reform, as well protests by the Yellow Vests movement that demands greater economic equality. And then, there’s a perception he’s arrogant and aloof.Even so, Macron’s approval rating is around 40% in recent surveys. He can count on a strong base of loyal voters and with the left- and right-wing parties in disarray and bickering over who will represent them in April 2022, he’s almost certain to make it to the second round of the election —  probably finding himself again facing off with far-right leader Marine Le Pen.It’s a crowded and moving field, though, so don’t rule out a surprise. After all, a year before Macron was elected, few would have bet on him.Here’s a look at some of the candidates who’ve already entered the race:The Populist: Marine Le PenThe National Rally leader believes her third attempt to win France’s top job will be the lucky one.In the decade since taking over the party from her father, Le Pen has been working hard to move it to the mainstream. She made it to the second round in the previous presidential ballot in 2017, but suffered a crushing defeat when progressives rallied around Macron to keep her out of the Elysee.As Le Pen, 52, stages her come back, she’s been tapping into anger over economic inequality and the dominance of Paris over the regions. She’s also lashed out at Macron for not having closed borders early enough to prevent the arrival of Covid-19 variants, as well as for the slow start to France’s vaccination campaign.Le Pen says she’s learned from her mistakes. To broaden her appeal, she’s abandoned her pledge to take France out of the EU and condemned racism. And she’s embarked on a public relations campaign, appearing regularly on TV and radio to sell her new image to more voters. The gap is narrowing between Le Pen and Macron. Yet, she’s still perceived by a majority of French as “aggressive” and “worrying,” according to a recent poll.What could help her? Massive abstention from left-wing voters who backed Macron in 2017. Second round polls show a much tighter margin between the president and Le Pen than before, with progressives reluctant to step in rescue him again after his tack to the right on issues ranging from taxation to immigration and Islam.The Old-School Left Winger: Jean-Luc MelenchonThe leader of the far-left France Unbowed party is running for the third time as well, after winning 20% of the vote in the first round of the 2017 election.Melenchon, 69, says the health crisis demanded a change in tactics so he’s no longer calling on people to create chaos and disobey — or as he says, he wants to move on “from the period of sound and fury.” He says he has dusted off his program and sought new ideas from key supporters, who tend to be highly-educated with lower revenue.Melenchon’s policy positions are firmly anchored to the left of the mainstream Socialist Party. He’s a staunch critic of the EU as it is and defends protectionism as well as strong social benefits. He advocates boosting public debt, which he says will eventually not be repaid by the state, and wants to cancel debt owned by the European Central Bank.A Melenchon win would likely be just as market adverse as a Le Pen win. His path to power includes uniting with the Green Party — it had a strong showing in last year’s city elections and its leaders have agreed they must forge an alliance with the left to contest the presidential ballot.The Blue Collar Conservative: Xavier BertrandThe president of the working class, northern region of Hauts-de-France left the conservative Les Republicains party after a hardliner was elected to its helm. He’s currently an independent.Often described as compatible with centrists, the 56-year-old former Minister for Labor, Employment, and Health in Nicolas Sarkozy’s government had been talking about throwing his hat in the ring for more than a year before finally saying that given the current political climate, it was “his duty” to run.He’s coming up with strong-handed proposals on security and terrorism, including lowering the age of penal responsibility to 15 years old, in a bid to win the backing of Les Republicains.One recent survey had Bertrand running third in the first round. He’ll need to win upcoming regional elections to show he stands a chance to get the top job.The Green-Friendly Socialist: Anne HidalgoIn 2014, the Spanish-born Socialist became the first woman to lead the French capital’s city hall, a political springboard for the late president Jacques Chirac. She began her tenure with a baptism of fire — a deadly attack by jihadists on the Paris offices of satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo followed months later by an even worse assault on venues including the Bataclan concert hall. Her handling of the crises earned praise from world leaders including Barack Obama.When a fire partially destroyed Notre-Dame Cathedral in June 2019, Hidalgo was still mayor, she’d go on to win a second term about a year later. She has overseen the city’s response to the Covid-19 pandemic and led a successful bid for the 2024 Summer Olympic Games.Hidalgo, 61, is regularly criticized by opponents for the dirtiness of some areas of Paris as well as her push to progressively ban cars from the city center, while some voters see her as part of a Parisian elite that doesn’t have a good grasp on what happens outside the capital. She has yet to reach the 10% voting intention threshold in polls.Still, Macron advisers reckon she’s a serious threat. Her tough measures on vehicles are in-line with demands by the Green Party, meaning she could potentially unite with them, and/or eventually attract the votes of social democrats who backed the president in 2017. The Former Wing Man: Edouard PhilippePhilippe, 50, hasn’t said he’s running, but he’s included here because, according to polls, he’s France’s most popular politician —  or, as he puts it, the “least unpopular.”Philippe was heading France as prime minister when the Yellow Vests protests and strikes against Macron’s planned pension reform emerged. He handled the beginning of the Covid pandemic, and pushed to keep the country under lockdown. He was replaced with Jean Castex last July, just as his popularity was climbing and he was threatening to steal his boss’s thunder with his poised, down-to-earth style.Now mayor of the northern, working-class town of Le Havre, Philippe has been raising his profile while out promoting his upcoming book, “Impressions and Clear Lines,” a chronicle of his experiences as prime minister that he co-wrote with a former adviser.Philippe’s always been loyal to Macron and makes a point of remaining ambiguous on his election plans. He could emerge as a replacement for the president’s La Republic En Marche movement should his popularity plummet.The Dark HorsesThe list of potential other candidates is endless and on the right includes figures like Bruno Retailleau, president of the Republican group in the Senate; former industry minister Arnaud Montebourg and Philippe Juvin, the right-wing mayor of the northern city Garenne-Colombes who rose to prominence during the pandemic as head of emergency services at the Georges-Pompidou hospital in Paris.Depending on the outcome of the regional elections, and whether Les Republicains decides to hold a primary, other candidates could include the party’s president of the Senate Gerard Larcher or Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier, who despite being featured in a lot of international press coverage, remains unknown to many in France, including those outside elite circles and the Brussels bubble.The Greens haven’t picked a candidate yet. The field includes Yannick Jadot, a member of European Parliament, the mayor of Grenoble, Eric Piolle and economist Sandrine Rousseau. Their problem is that all parties are talking about the climate and ecology now, even Le Pen’s nationalists. They contend they’re the original while others are pale copies, but they’re being upstaged and the debate is moving on to other issues, such as religion and the economy. Still, the Greens have the potential to rally a large part of the left and Macron’s lieutenants have been on the attack, well aware that just across the Rhine, a German and more centrist version is running neck-and-neck with the incumbent government, five months before an election.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/french-president-macron-s-job-is-on-the-line-and-these-are-main-contenders-101619071893290.html

22-04-2021||World||New US Bill to counter China includes policies for Tibet, Xinjiang||The United States in its new Bill to counter China includes policies for Tibet, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Xinjiang, the problem areas of the People's Republic of China, where it aims to uphold democratic values against China's oppression. The 283-page bill, crafted by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, is designed to counter China's economic and geopolitical power.Under Section 136 of the Bill, which deals with how the US will support independent media and counter disinformation, it says the US Agency for Global media shall increase funding for Radio Free Asia's Mandarin, Tibetan, Uyghur and Cantonese language services. It also said how China spends extensively on influence operations, even in western countries. For example, China spent $500,0000,000 on an advertising campaign to attract cable viewers in Australia, it said.Also Read: PLA steps up drive to recruit Tibetans"The United States and European nations share serious concerns with the repressions being supported and executed by the government of China in Tibet, Hong Kong and Xinjiang, the Bill said adding that the government should continue implementing measures to address China's specific abuses in these regions and should build joint mechanisms and programmes to prevent the export of China's authoritarian governance model to countries around the world," the Bill, unveiled early in April, says.When the US will conduct an annual review on the presence of Chinese companies in US capital markets, it will see whether the company has contributed to the repression of religious and ethnic minorities within China, including Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region or Tibet Autonomous Regions, the Bill mentions.In its regional strategies to counter the People's Republic of China, the United States lists Tibetan Buddhists among whom the US wants to promote the values of democracy and human rights.The Bill also backs the resumption of normal relations with Taiwan, considered as a rebel province by China. Section 212 of the Bill says it is the policy of the United States to recognise Taiwan as a vital part of the United States Ino-pacific strategy. The policy is aimed at advancing the security of Taiwan and its democracy as key elements for the continued peace and stability of the greater Indo-Pacific region etc.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-us-bill-to-counter-china-includes-policies-for-tibet-xinjiang-101619066870279.html
22-04-2021||World||Samsung boss Lee Jae-yong on trial over 'manipulated' takeover of group||The jailed de facto leader of the giant Samsung group went on trial Thursday over a stock manipulation case that effectively puts South Korea's system of conglomerate control in the dock.Samsung -- whose flagship subsidiary is among the world's biggest smartphone and computer chip makers -- is by far the largest of the family-controlled empires known as chaebols that dominate business in South Korea, the world's 12th-largest economy.Chaebol families often have only a small ownership stake in their empires, but maintain control through complex webs of cross-shareholdings between units.Lee Jae-yong, the vice-chairman of Samsung Electronics and the grandson of the group's founder, is accused of stock manipulation, breach of trust and other offences when two other subsidiaries, Samsung C&T and Cheil Industries, merged in 2015.Lee -- who had emergency surgery for appendicitis last month, delaying the proceedings -- looked gaunt in court, reports said, and wore a dark suit with a white shirt.Lee was the largest shareholder in Cheil Industries, and critics say Samsung sought to artificially lower the price of C&T to give him a bigger stake in the merged entity -- a key part of the Samsung structure -- consolidating his grip on the conglomerate ahead of his father's death last year.His lawyers have previously said that everything he did in connection with the merger was legal.Lee is already serving a two-and-a-half year prison sentence for bribery, embezzlement and other offences in connection with the corruption scandal that brought down ex-South Korean president Park Geun-hye.Samsung is crucial to South Korea's economic health, and is active in sectors ranging from construction to healthcare to insurance.But Vladimir Tikhonov, professor of Korean Studies at the University of Oslo, told AFP: "The most problematic aspect is the attempted continuation of the unchallenged dynastic rule over a company which is responsible over 20 percent of South Korea's GDP."Samsung's main stakeholders are its shareowners, including the minor ones, its workers and South Korean society as a whole," he said."It is too big to be a dynastic property."Lee's father, Samsung chairman Lee Kun-hee, died in October, leaving his heirs a vast fortune and an inheritance tax bill of around 13 trillion won ($11.7 billion), with the first instalment due by the end of this month.Lee apologised last May for some governance issues at the group, pledging to ensure "there will be no more controversy over the succession" and that he would not allow his children to take over from him at the firm.Presidential pardonsIn the past, some chaebol leaders convicted of various offences have subsequently received presidential pardons in recognition of their economic roles.Some scholars have said a leadership vacuum could hamper Samsung Electronics' decision-making on future large-scale investments, which have been key to its global rise.And a business grouping whose members include the leaders of the second-biggest chaebol Hyundai Motor and steel firm POSCO, ranked sixth, last week called for a special pardon for Lee, saying his absence would bring "adverse effects to the South Korean economy and industry as a whole".Seoul's finance minister Hong Nam-ki said he had passed the proposal to "those with authority", implying the presidential Blue House.Despite Lee's absence, Samsung Electronics has flagged a leap of 44.2 percent in first-quarter operating profits, with robust sales of smartphones and the coronavirus-driven working from home boosting demand for devices powered by its chips.A pardon for Lee would not be justified, Tikhonov said."The company's bureaucracy is fully capable of meeting day-to-day challenges even with the head boss being out of office," he said."We need to establish a precedent of the rule of the law equally applied to everybody, regardless of the size of their fortune. The pardon won't be conducive to this socially important goal."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/samsung-boss-lee-jae-yong-on-trial-over-manipulated-takeover-of-group-101619065702305.html
22-04-2021||World||Encrypted chat app Signal alleges flaws in Cellebrite equipment||Encrypted chat app Signal suggested in a blog post published on Wednesday that products sold to law enforcement from Israeli surveillance provider Cellebrite can easily be sabotaged.Cellebrite DI Ltd, which specializes in helping law enforcement and intelligence agencies copy call logs, texts, photos and other data off of smartphones, has repeatedly come under fire for past sales to authoritarian governments, including Russia and China.Signal, a privacy-focused app eager to show the lengths it goes to protect users' conversations, clashed with Cellebrite last year when the Israeli company said its equipment was upgraded to allow law enforcement to scoop up Signal messages from devices in their possession.Signal creator and CEO Moxie Marlinspike said in his blog post on Wednesday he had come into possession of a bag of Cellebrite equipment and examined the gear inside.He was "surprised to find that very little care seems to have been given to Cellebrite's own software security," Marlinspike said, noting it would be easy to add a specially crafted file onto a phone that would derail Cellebrite's functionality.In a statement, Cellebrite did not directly address Marlinspike's claim but said that the company's employees "continually audit and update our software in order to equip our customers with the best digital intelligence solutions available."Elsewhere in his blog post, Marlinspike alleged he had found snippets of code from Apple Inc inside Cellebrite's software, something he said "might present a legal risk for Cellebrite and its users" if it was done without authorization.Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Signal's allegations come as Cellebrite prepares to go public through a merger with a blank-check firm, valuing the equity of the combined company at around $2.4 billion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/encrypted-chat-app-signal-alleges-flaws-in-cellebrite-equipment-101619061421630.html
22-04-2021||World||NASA's Perseverance Mars rover extracts first oxygen from Red Planet||The growing list of "firsts" for Perseverance, NASA's newest six-wheeled robot on the Martian surface, includes converting some of the Red Planet's thin, carbon dioxide-rich atmosphere into oxygen.In a press release, NASA said that a toaster-size, experimental instrument aboard Perseverance called the Mars Oxygen In-Situ Resource Utilization Experiment (MOXIE) accomplished the task. The test took place April 20, the 60th Martian day, or sol, since the mission landed on February 18."While the technology demonstration is just getting started, it could pave the way for science fiction to become science fact - isolating and storing oxygen on Mars to help power rockets that could lift astronauts off the planet's surface. Such devices also might one day provide breathable air for astronauts themselves. MOXIE is an exploration technology investigation - as is the Mars Environmental Dynamics Analyzer (MEDA) weather station - and is sponsored by NASA's Space Technology Mission Directorate (STMD) and Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate," NASA said."This is a critical first step at converting carbon dioxide to oxygen on Mars," said Jim Reuter, associate administrator for STMD. "MOXIE has more work to do, but the results from this technology demonstration are full of promise as we move toward our goal of one day seeing humans on Mars. Oxygen isn't just the stuff we breathe. Rocket propellant depends on oxygen, and future explorers will depend on producing propellant on Mars to make the trip home."For rockets or astronauts, oxygen is key, said MOXIE's principal investigator, Michael Hecht of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Haystack Observatory.To burn its fuel, a rocket must have more oxygen by weight. Getting four astronauts off the Martian surface on a future mission would require approximately 15,000 pounds (seven metric tons) of rocket fuel and 55,000 pounds (25 metric tons) of oxygen. In contrast, astronauts living and working on Mars would require far less oxygen to breathe. "The astronauts who spend a year on the surface will maybe use one metric ton between them," Hecht said.Hauling 25 metric tons of oxygen from Earth to Mars would be an arduous task. Transporting a one-ton oxygen converter - a larger, more powerful descendant of MOXIE that could produce those 25 tons - would be far more economical and practical.Mars' atmosphere is 96 per cent carbon dioxide. MOXIE works by separating oxygen atoms from carbon dioxide molecules, which are made up of one carbon atom and two oxygen atoms. A waste product, carbon monoxide, is emitted into the Martian atmosphere.The conversion process requires high levels of heat to reach a temperature of approximately 1,470 degrees Fahrenheit (800 Celsius). To accommodate this, the MOXIE unit is made with heat-tolerant materials. These include 3D-printed nickel alloy parts, which heat and cool the gases flowing through it, and a lightweight aerogel that helps hold in the heat. A thin gold coating on the outside of MOXIE reflects infrared heat, keeping it from radiating outward and potentially damaging other parts of Perseverance.In this first operation, MOXIE's oxygen production was quite modest - about five grams, equivalent to about 10 minutes worth of breathable oxygen for an astronaut. MOXIE is designed to generate up to 10 grams of oxygen per hour.This technology demonstration was designed to ensure the instrument survived the launch from Earth, a nearly seven-month journey through deep space, and touchdown with Perseverance on February 18. MOXIE is expected to extract oxygen at least nine more times over the course of a Martian year (nearly two years on Earth).These oxygen-production runs will come in three phases. The first phase will check out and characterise the instrument's function, while the second phase will run the instrument in varying atmospheric conditions, such as different times of day and seasons. In the third phase, Hecht said, "we'll push the envelope" - trying new operating modes, or introducing "new wrinkles, such as a run where we compare operations at three or more different temperatures.""MOXIE isn't just the first instrument to produce oxygen on another world," said Trudy Kortes, director of technology demonstrations within STMD. It's the first technology of its kind that will help future missions "live off the land," using elements of another world's environment, also known as in-situ resource utilisation."It's taking regolith, the substance you find on the ground, and putting it through a processing plant, making it into a large structure, or taking carbon dioxide - the bulk of the atmosphere - and converting it into oxygen," she said. "This process allows us to convert these abundant materials into useable things: propellant, breathable air, or, combined with hydrogen, water."A key objective of Perseverance's mission on Mars is astrobiology, including the search for signs of ancient microbial life. The rover will characterise the planet's geology and past climate, pave the way for human exploration of the Red Planet, and be the first mission to collect and cache Martian rock and regolith (broken rock and dust), according to NASA.The Mars 2020 Perseverance mission is part of NASA's Moon to Mars exploration approach, which includes Artemis missions to the Moon that will help prepare for human exploration of the Red Planet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nasas-perseverance-mars-rover-extracts-first-oxygen-from-red-planet-101619058640738.html

This means anyone who is not a UK or Irish resident or a British citizen cannot enter the UK if they've been in India in the previous 10 days," Hancock had told parliament.Heathrow Airport's refusal to allow extra flights from India was reported earlier by the BBC, with the airport adding that it turned down the requests from airlines because of concerns about queues at passport control.The airport also told Reuters it did not want to exacerbate existing pressures at the border by allowing more passengers to fly in.India now faces a coronavirus "storm" overwhelming its health system, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in a national address on Tuesday, with the world's second-most populous nation reporting 295,041 new coronavirus infections on Wednesday - the biggest daily rise reported in any country - stretching its hospitals to breaking point.India's 2,023 deaths in one day were also its highest in the pandemic.At least 24 COVID-19 patients in western India died on Wednesday when the oxygen supply to their ventilators ran out, amid a nationwide shortage of the gas and a surge in infections.Health experts said India had let its guard down when the virus seemed to be under control during the winter, allowing big gatherings such as weddings and festivals.Modi is himself facing criticism for addressing packed political rallies for local elections and allowing a religious festival to go ahead where millions gathered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/heathrow-airport-rejects-requests-for-extra-flights-from-india-101619058797557.html

So this is a great concern to us," Lenderking told a House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee hearing."Iran's support to the Houthis is quite significant, and it's lethal," Lenderking said.A Saudi Arabia-led military coalition intervened in Yemen in 2015 after the Iran-aligned Houthi group ousted the country's government from the capital Sanaa. The Houthis have said they are fighting a corrupt system."We would welcome Iran playing a constructive role if they are willing to do so. We have not seen any indication of that," Lenderking said.Iran has denied supporting the Houthis. A spokesman for Iran's mission to the United Nations in New York dismissed Lenderking's remarks as unsubstantiated claims against Iran."Iran has, time and again called for a peaceful settlement of the conflict in Yemen," the Iranian spokesman said. "In contrast, the US has been providing the deadliest weapons to those who are using them to kill innocent men, women and children on a daily basis."US President Joe Biden said in February that Washington was ending all American support for the Saudi-led offensive operations in Yemen, including relevant arms sales.Since taking office in January, Biden has made Yemen a priority and appointed Lenderking to help revive stalled UN efforts to end a conflict widely seen as a proxy war between rivals Saudi Arabia and Iran."What I see is continued aiding and abetting an army of Houthis by the Iranians so that they can continue attacking Saudi Arabia, and unfortunately those attacks have risen quite strongly in the last couple of months," Lenderking told a Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee hearing later on Wednesday.The United States should "leave the matter of finding a resolution to the senseless conflict in the capable hands of the regional countries," the Iranian UN mission spokesman said.Fighting has intensified in recent days as the Houthis push their offensive to take Marib, which if successful would strengthen the movement's hand in any future political negotiations."This offensive is the single biggest threat to peace efforts and is also having devastating humanitarian consequences. If we do not stop the fighting in Marib now, it will trigger a wave of even greater fighting and instability," Lenderking said.There are about 70,000 US citizens living in neighbouring Saudi Arabia, Lenderking said, and "it is our greatest fear that Americans will be killed in a Houthi attack."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-provides-lethal-support-to-yemen-s-houthis-says-us-official-101619058033763.html

Lisa Murkowski joined with Democrats in support of President Joe Biden's Justice Department nominee.Vice President Kamala Harris was on hand for a procedural vote Wednesday morning in case she was needed for a possible 50-50 tie, but her vote wasn't necessary after Murkowski, a moderate Republican from Alaska, broke with her Republican colleagues to back Gupta.Murkowski explained her support for Gupta on the Senate floor, saying she was troubled by some of Gupta's statements but decided to back her confirmation following a lengthy conversation with the nominee, CNN reported."I asked her point-blank, 'Why do you want this? Is this worth it?' Because this has clearly been very hard on her as a nominee," Murkowski said. "And she paused and reflected a moment, and just spoke to how she feels called to serve in a very personal way that I thought was impactful.""I am going to give the benefit of the doubt to a woman who I believe has demonstrated throughout her professional career to be deeply, deeply committed to matters of justice," she added.Gupta has served in Justice Department's Civil Rights Division under the Obama administration.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-senate-confirms-vanita-gupta-as-associate-attorney-general-101619053963829.html

The official spoke after a second round of talks in Vienna this past week in which the US and Iran didn’t meet directly but negotiated through their European, Russian and Chinese partners.The official’s comments appeared intended to counter speculation of an impending deal after Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said the talks are 60%-70% complete and the two sides could soon resuscitate the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, which limited the scope of Iran’s nuclear program in exchange for the easing of economic sanctions.President Donald Trump pulled out of the nuclear accord in 2018 -- calling it the “worst deal ever” -- and ramped up restrictions on the Islamic Republic, including on oil sales. Iran responded later by enriching uranium beyond agreed-upon limits, but insisting it remained a party to the nuclear accord.The US declined to say which sanctions the Biden administration is prepared to lift, while making clear that terror-related restrictions imposed late in the Trump administration would likely be one target.The official also said the two sides had made some progress in the talks and acknowledged that the U.S. was open to different types of sequencing under which both nations would return to compliance with the deal.In the past, President Joe Biden and his team have argued that the US would come back into compliance only after Iran did.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-says-talks-with-iran-on-nuke-deal-progressed-saw-modest-progress-101619050069742.html

Police said rescuers transported victims to nearby hospitals. Footage on Pakistan news channels showed burning cars.Hours after the attack, the Pakistani Taliban in a statement claimed responsibility, saying it was a suicide attack. The Pakistani Taliban, or Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan, is a separate insurgent group from the Afghan Taliban.Senior police official Azhar Akram said officers were trying to determine whether the bomb was planted in a vehicle that was parked in the hotel’s parking lot. He provided no further details, saying police were still investigating. Other security officials said the bomb exploded minutes after a car entered the parking lot, and authorities were investigating to determine whether it was a suicide attack.Wasim Beg, a spokesperson at the provincial health department, said four people died and 12 were wounded in the bombing.It was unclear who was behind the attack. Southwestern Baluchistan province is the scene of a long-running insurgency by secessionist groups like the Baluchistan Liberation Front and the Baluchistan Liberation Army. They have for decades staged attacks to press their demands for independence. The Pakistani Taliban and Islamic State group also have a presence there.No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attack in the provincial capital.Pakistan’s Interior Minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmed quickly blamed neighboring India for the hotel bombing, although he provided no evidence to back up the allegation. He told a Pakistani Geo news channel that Pakistan had only one enemy and it was neighboring India, which he alleged was behind the bombing. Ahmed said they had received intelligence about possible attacks in the capital, Islamabad and elsewhere and the information had been shared with relevant authorities to beef up securityLiaquat Shahwani, a provincial government spokesman, called the attack an act of terrorism. “Terrorists want to disrupt peace in Baluchistan. Those who don't want to see progress and prosperity in the Baluchistan province are responsible for this act of terrorism."Jam Kamal Khan, chief minister in Baluchistan, took to Twitter to condemn the bombing. Pakistan Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry said authorities were investigating and a statement would be issued later.Baluchistan’s Home Minister Ziaullah Langove said Chinese Ambassador Nong Rong was staying at the hotel at the time of the bombing but it was unclear what the motive was behind the attack. He said no guests were hurt but that a police officer was among four people who died in the attack.The hotel is frequented by foreigners as it is the city's only luxury hotel and is considered safe.Arbab Kamran Kasi, a doctor at Quetta's main hospital, said about a dozen wounded were being brought their and they declared an emergency at the hospital to handle victims.The bombing in Quetta came hours after Pakistan and neighboring Iran opened a new border crossing point in Baluchistan to improve trade and economic relations. Baluchistan shares a border with Iran and Afghanistan.The Pakistani Taliban have been targeting the military and civilians across the country since 2001, when this Islamic nation joined the U.S.-led war on terror following the Sept. 11 attack in the United States. Since then, the insurgents have declared war on the government of Pakistan and have carried out numerous attacks. Pakistan’s militant groups are often interlinked with those across the border in Afghanistan.Pakistan has nearly completed a fence along the border with Afghanistan, which Islamabad says is necessary to prevent militant attacks from both sides. Pakistan and neighboring Afghanistan often accuse each other of turning a blind eye to Islamic militants operating along the porous frontier.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/blast-at-pakistan-hotel-hosting-china-official-kills-4-101619050559460.html

This is "an incredible achievement for the nation."Click here for full Covid-19 coverageBiden called the 200 million shots in 100 days a "goal unmatched in the world or in prior mass vaccination efforts in American history.""The progress we've made has been stunning," he said.Announcing a tax break to encourage businesses to give all employees a day off for vaccinations, Biden said the country was still "on track" to being able to celebrate the July 4th Independence Day holiday in relative normality.But he warned that rising infection rates in parts of the country showed that it was too early to declare victory."If we let up now and stop being vigilant, this virus will erase the progress," he said.While the United States leads the world in reported Covid-19 deaths, it has also raced ahead in the vaccination stakes, outperforming some major European countries and neighboring Canada.Biden came into office on January 20 initially vowing to get 100 million shots administered in his first 100 days. On March 25, with vaccination deliveries far ahead of their targets, he doubled the goal.Starting in May, all states will be required to lift restrictions on eligibility for access to the free shots. Many have already done that.Dampening the celebratory mood in the White House is a surge of infection rates in parts of the country, including the state of Michigan.Death rates, however, remain down nationwide as a result of the high vaccination rate among the elderly and improved care.\||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-gives-200-million-covid-vaccine-doses-joe-biden-hails-stunning-achievement-101619050053804.html
22-04-2021||World||Indonesian navy search for submarine with 53 aboard||Indonesian navy ships on Thursday scoured a patch of ocean off the coast of Bali searching for a submarine with 53 crew aboard after losing contact with the vessel during military exercises.The German-built KRI Nanggala 402 was scheduled to do live torpedo exercises when it asked for permission to dive early Wednesday morning, authorities said."After permission was given according to the procedure, the submarine lost contact and could not be reached," the defence ministry said.A helicopter looking for the missing vessel spotted an oil spill in waters where the submarine was thought to have submerged, it added.The navy said it has not pinpointed the submarine's location but narrowed the search down based on the spill.The oil "could indicate damage on the body" of the submarine, navy spokesman Julius Widjojono told MetroTV.Two warships and some 400 personnel were sent out to hunt for the sub, while a third vessel was deployed from the capital Jakarta.The navy also sent out an international distress signal and "several countries have responded and are ready to help including Singapore, Australia and India," the defence ministry said.There were 53 crew aboard the vessel, which was believed to be in waters about 700 metres (2,300 feet) deep.Indonesia, which has been moving to upgrade its military equipment in recent years, has five German and South Korean-built submarines in its fleet.The 1,300-tonne KRI Nanggala 402 was built in 1978, according to a government website.The vessel is a Type 209 diesel-electric attack submarine that has served in more than a dozen navies around the world, including Greece, India, Argentina and Turkey, over the past half century."It's a classic submarine," French navy vice admiral Antoine Beaussant told AFP.It had a safety descent level of 250 metres, and "if it went down to rest at 700 metres the likelihood is it would have broken up," he said.Submarine disastersWhile the Southeast Asian archipelago has not previously suffered a major submarine disaster, other countries have been struck by accidents in the past.Among them was the 2000 sinking of the Kursk, the pride of Russia's Northern Fleet.The submarine was on manoeuvres in the Barents Sea on August 12, 2000 when it sank with the loss of all 118 aboard. An inquiry found a torpedo had exploded, detonating all the others.Most crew died instantly but some survived for several days -- with a few keeping heart-breaking diaries written in blood to their loved ones -- before suffocating.Seventy Chinese naval officers and crew were killed, apparently suffocated, in an accident on a Ming-class submarine conducting exercises in 2003.In 2008, 20 people were killed by poisonous gas when a fire extinguishing system was accidentally activated on a Russian submarine being tested in the Sea of Japan.In 2018, authorities found the wreckage of an Argentine submarine that had gone missing a year earlier with 44 sailors aboard.Crushed from an implosion, the ARA San Juan was located at a depth of more than 900 metres (3,000 feet) in an area of undersea craters and canyons 400 kilometres (250 miles) off the coast of Argentina.In 2019, a French submarine that had gone missing in the Mediterranean more than 50 years earlier was found.The diesel-electric Minerve submarine was lost off France's southern coast with 52 sailors on board on January 27, 1968.Experts believe that the disaster was caused by a problem with the Minerve's rudder, a collision with another boat, the explosion of a missile or torpedo, or a fault with its oxygen supply systems.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indonesian-navy-search-for-submarine-with-53-aboard-101619049160903.html
22-04-2021||World||India urges US to lift ban on export of key products||Indian officials have raised with their US counterparts the impact of a wartime production law on the supply of raw materials needed by Indian manufacturers of Covid-19 vaccines and the two sides are working together to find appropriate solutions.The matter was taken up by India’s ambassador to the US Taranjit Singh Sandhu soon after the Defense Production Act was invoked by President Joe Biden on February 5 to boost domestic vaccine production. External affairs minister S Jaishankar raised it with secretary of state Antony Blinken when they spoke on Monday, people familiar with developments said.Serum Institute of India (SII), the world’s largest manufacturer of vaccines, too took up the matter with the US administration in February, and the firm’s CEO Adar Poonawalla requested Biden through a tweet on April 16 “to lift the embargo of raw material exports out of the U.S”.The US side has promised to “give the matter due consideration” and to work with India to “find appropriate solutions”, according to the people cited above.The curbs put in place by the US administration – the American side insists there is no “explicit export ban” – have affected the supplies of more than 35 crucial items needed by Indian vaccine manufacturers such as SII and Biological E. SII officials have said the raw materials are needed for making the Novavax dose and the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine (Covishield in India).SII chief executive Adar Poonawalla told CNBC-TV18 on Wednesday that Covishield production is not likely to be hit, but its Novavax production is likely to be hampered.SII currently manufactures about 170 million doses of both vaccines a month and reports have suggested that production could be hit if the US curbs continue for a few more weeks. Besides scaling up production to meet India’s needs, SII and Biological E are expected to face problems in meeting contracts signed with other countries.The Oxford vaccine, locally produced in India, is one of the two vaccines that are currently being administered in the country. The Novavax shot will be eligible to get clearance in India after approval from a major foreign country; it has not been authorised by the US, the UK, EU and Japan so far.Participating in an online discussion on Monday, Jaishankar referred to the matter indirectly when he said he was “pushing other countries, particularly some big countries, [to] please keep the raw materials flowing for vaccines to be made in India”. He also highlighted the crucial role of global supply chains in the manufacture of vaccines while responding to a question on criticism of India’s vaccine exports. “Can I, on one hand, go round the world and say, guys, keep your supply chain flowing towards me, and by the way... I am asking you for raw material but I am not going to give you the vaccine?” he asked.The raw materials affected by the US curbs include reagents, plastic tubing material, nano-filters and bioreactor bags, and the steps taken by the Biden administration ensure that American manufacturers get priority for these items.The people cited above said it is also not easy to switch to suppliers in other countries because all raw materials and equipment used in making vaccines have to be approved by regulators. “For instance, approvals granted earlier wouldn’t cover raw materials from a new supplier,” said one of the people.American sellers of the raw materials are obligated to meet the contractual requirements of American buyers before anyone else, including Indian buyers, who have told to expect delayed deliveries, according to people familiar with these discussions.Former president Donald Trump, too, had involved the 1950 law in August last year to scale up production of medical supplies.Now that the US has administered at least one dose to half its population and built up a sizable stockpile of vaccines, its raw material needs may be tapering off, which would allow American suppliers to resume deliveries.Asked about the bottleneck in raw material supplies, White House spokesperson Jen Psaki spoke about discussions at the WTO on Monday. “We are...working with WTO members on a global response to Covid. That includes a number of components, whether it’s $4 billion committed to COVAX, or discussions about how we can aid and assist countries that need help the most,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-urges-us-to-lift-ban-on-export-of-key-products-101619039449573.html
22-04-2021||World||Put border dispute at appropriate position: China tells India||India should focus on a long-term development of ties with China and put the border dispute at an “appropriate position”, the Chinese foreign ministry said on Wednesday, adding that New Delhi should work with Beijing to bring ties back on the tracks of steady development.The Chinese foreign ministry added that Beijing was committed to maintaining peace at the border, but also determined to safeguard the country’s territorial integrity.China and India are maintaining close communication through diplomatic and military channels, ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said.Wang was responding to Indian ambassador Vikram Misri’s recent statement that there’s a tendency in some quarters to sweep the situation at the border “under the carpet” and characterise it as just a trivial issue.Misri was speaking via video link at a high-level India-China dialogue where he made it clear that sweeping the problem under the carpet was “inadvisable”.“In fact, it would be tantamount to running away from the problem and in a direction opposite to that where the promise of our closer development partnership lies,” Misri had told a gathering, which included the Chinese ambassador to India, Sun Weidong.Asked to comment on Misri’s assertion, Wang Wenbin reiterated China’s often-repeated public position on the border dispute.“On the issue of China-India boundary situation, China’s position is consistent and clear. We are committed to maintaining peace and stability in the border areas and we are firmly determined to safeguard our territorial sovereignty and security,” he said.“Recently the two sides have maintained communications through diplomatic and military channels. On the basis of disengagement in the Galwan Valley and the Pangong Tso regions, the two sides exchanged in depth and in a candid manner, opinions on resolving the remaining issue in the Western section of the boundary,” he added.“We hope India will meet China half-way and will focus on the bigger picture of long term development of bilateral relations, put the boundary at an appropriate position and work to bring relations back to the track of steady and sound development,” Wang said.India, he said, should take concrete measures to safeguard peace and tranquility along the border and work to bring bilateral relations back on the tracks of sound and steady development.“We hope that the Indian side will abide by two militaries agreements and two sides consensus and take concrete measures to safeguard peace and tranquility along the border,” he said.India and China have held multiple rounds of diplomatic and military dialogues to resolve the ongoing tension at the border, the worst in decades, which saw soldiers dying on both sides for the first time since 1975.The latest meeting of senior Indian and Chinese military commanders held on April 9 ended without any forward movement on disengagement at other friction points such as Depsang, Hot Springs and Gogra, though the two sides agreed to maintain stability on the ground and avoid any new incidents.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/put-border-dispute-at-appropriate-position-china-tells-india-101619033265569.html

And where it will be - we will determine that ourselves,” he added.Putin also denounced Western silence on Belarus strongman Alexander Lukashenko’s claim that his security services had thwarted an alleged US plot to assassinate him.“Everyone pretends that nothing is happening at all,” Putin said in his address, referring to the West.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dont-cross-the-red-line-with-russia-putin-s-stern-message-to-the-west-101619030112512.html

The negotiations will pick up again next week.Iran and world powers - Britain, China, France, Germany and Russia - have been meeting in Vienna since early April to hammer out steps that must be taken, touching on US sanctions and Tehran’s breaches of the deal’s limits on its uranium enrichment capacity.A US delegation is in a separate location in Vienna, enabling the powers to shuttle between both sides.“We welcome the constructive discussions that have taken place in Vienna, and the positive participation by all sides so far,” diplomats from France, Britain and Germany, known as the E3, told reporters. “We have made some progress but there is still a way to go.” Under the accord, Iran agreed to curb its nuclear work in return for the lifting of US-backed sanctions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/wsj-us-may-ease-sanctions-on-iran-101619029717869.html

In this regard, it is clarified that where insurers have an arrangement with the hospitals for providing cashless facility, such network hospitals are obligated to provide cashless treatment for all treatments including treatment for Covid-19,” IRDAI noted in a statement on Thursday.All the network providers (hospitals), who have signed Service Legal Agreements (SLA) with general and health insurers, have to “mandatorily” provide cashless facility for any treatment to the policyholders, including for Covid-19, the regulatory body noted further.In the event of being denied cashless treatment, the aggrieved policyholders, IRDAI said, can send a complaint to the concerned insurance company.

22-04-2021||India||UAE, Oman, Australia impose travel curbs on India amid massive Covid-19 surge||The United Arab Emirates (UAE), Australia and Oman have joined the list of countries that have imposed travel restrictions on India in the wake of a massive surge in Coronavirus infections, either completely barring or restricting flights from the country. On Thursday, Singapore further tightened restrictions for travellers from India, mainly to prevent the spread of Covid-19 in its crowded workers’ dormitories. Officials acknowledged that the move would impact the construction and marine sectors, which employ a large number of people from India and other South Asian countries. The National Emergency Crisis and Disaster Management Authority and the General Civil Aviation Authority of the UAE announced the temporary suspension of all flights from India and the entry of transit passengers for a period of 10 days from April 25. Cargo flights between the two sides were exempted from the ban. People who transited through India in the past 14 days will also be barred from entering the UAE and the travel ban will be reviewed after 10 days, according to the announcement. The ban will not apply to UAE nationals, diplomatic passport holders, official delegations, and “golden residency” visa holders, though they will be required to take further preventive measures such as a 10-day quarantine and a RT-PCR test at the airport. Flights between Indian cities and Dubai have been among the busiest routes even during the pandemic as the UAE is home to more than three million Indians, one of the largest concentrations of expatriates in West Asia. The UAE became the third country after the UK and Oman to bar the entry of Indian nationals even as the daily infections surged past the 300,000-mark.On Wednesday, Oman barred the entry of travellers from India, Pakistan and Bangladesh from April 24. The ban will also cover travellers who transited through any of the three South Asian countries over the past 14 days, Oman’s Supreme Committee announced. The Australian government has decided to temporarily reduce the number of flights from India by 30% after registering a spike in incoming travellers testing positive for Covid-19. People coming from high-risk countries such as India will also have to test negative for Covid-19 at least 72 hours before boarding a flight to Australia. Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the reduction will apply to government-organised repatriation flights and commercial flights. The change will take effect “in the months ahead”, he said without giving details. Authorities in Australia’s Northern Territory (NT) said there would be changes to the schedule of repatriation flights from India to Howard Springs and the requirements for travellers. “All repatriation flights not yet booked but planned for the NT for May will now be deferred until June,” chief minister Michael Gunner was quoted as saying by ABC News. “Anyone returning from India on these flights and all flights thereafter will be required to isolate for two weeks prior to departure,” he said. The move follows the Howard Springs quarantine facility dealing with the highest number of Covid-19 cases since it began handling repatriation flights last year, with most cases recorded among arrivals from India. Singapore on Thursday announced that all long-term pass holders and short-term visitors with a history of travel to India within the last 14 days wouldn’t be allowed entry into the country from April 24. This includes travellers transiting through India and those who had obtained prior approval for entry into Singapore, officials said. “We know that this major move will have an impact on our construction, marine and process sectors. And many local SMEs and contractors will be badly impacted,” Lawrence Wong, co-chair of Singapore’s Covid-19 multi-ministry task force, told a news conference. Singapore’s health ministry had on Tuesday said Covid-19 border measures would be tightened for travellers from India, who will have to stay at home for an additional seven days after the mandatory 14-day stay at dedicated facilities. The US, the UK and New Zealand have imposed fresh restrictions on travellers from India or issued advisories against travelling to India in the backdrop of a massive spike in coronavirus cases. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Japan Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga have called off planned visits to India because of the Covid-19 situation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uae-oman-australia-impose-travel-curbs-on-india-amid-massive-covid-19-surge-101619112051201.html

22-04-2021||India||At global climate summit, PM Modi unveils new US partnership to foster investments, ties||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday unveiled a new partnership with the US for investments and collaborations to tackle climate change and told a global summit convened by President Joe Biden that a “back to basics” approach should guide economic recovery in the post-Covid-19 era. The two-day Virtual Leaders’ Summit on Climate, the first major global initiative by Biden since he assumed office in January, is bringing together some 40 world leaders to forge solutions for climate change and resilient economic development. India is seen as key to future strategies on climate action, given its increasing consumption of fossil fuels and economic growth in recent years. Modi didn’t pledge any new goals, though he announced the new initiative with the US. He and Biden are launching the “India-US climate and clean energy agenda 2030 partnership” to “help mobilise investments, demonstrate clean technologies, and enable green collaborations”, he said. Further details of this partnership weren’t immediately available from both countries. Modi also emphasised the importance of lifestyle change in climate action. “Sustainable lifestyles and a guiding philosophy of ‘back to basics’ must be an important pillar of our economic strategy for the post-Covid era,” he said. Though people around the world are battling a global pandemic now, this leaders summit on climate is a “timely reminder that the grave threat of climate change has not disappeared,” Modi said. “In fact, climate change is a lived reality for millions around the world. Their lives and livelihoods are already facing its adverse consequences,” he added. Modi sought concrete action to combat climate change, adding such action is needed at “a high speed, on a large scale, and with a global scope”. He pointed out India is doing its part through measures such as the country’s renewable energy target of 450 GW by 2030. “Despite our development challenges, we have taken many bold steps on clean energy, energy efficiency, afforestation and bio-diversity. That is why we are among the few countries whose NDCs [nationally determined contributions] are 2-degree Celsius compatible,” he said. India has also encouraged global initiatives such as International Solar Alliance and Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure and the country’s per capita carbon footprint is 60% lower than the global average because the people’s lifestyle is rooted in sustainable traditional practices, he said. As a developing country, India welcomes partners to create templates for sustainable development that can also help other developing nations in need of affordable access to green finance and clean technologies, he added. Citing Swami Vivekananda’s call to “Arise, awake and stop not until the goal is reached”, Modi said: “Let us make this a decade of action against climate change.” Biden described climate change as “the existential crisis of our time” and announced a new goal of cutting US greenhouse gas emissions by up to 52% by 2030 as he launched the summit. ”This is the decade we must make decisions that will avoid the worst consequences of the climate crisis,” he said. The new US target is relative to 2005 levels, and the measures the Biden administration intends to put in place include boosting the fuel efficiency of vehicles, supporting carbon capture at industrial facilities and moving towards carbon pollution-free electricity.   China too is seen as crucial to all global climate action efforts in view of its energy consumption and economic growth and President Xi Jinping told the summit his country will control coal consumption in coming years and reduce fossil fuel use during 2026-30. Under the 2015 Paris climate agreement, world leaders agreed to limit global warming to below 2 degrees Celsius. Average global temperatures have increased by more than 1.1 degree Celsius since 1980, and this has been cited by experts as the cause of severe heat waves, droughts and storms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/at-global-climate-summit-pm-modi-unveils-new-us-partnership-to-foster-investments-ties-101619108750998.html
22-04-2021||India||Ten days before counting, Assam Congress moves candidates to a resort||Assam Congress on Thursday shifted most of its candidates who contested the recently held assembly polls to a resort on the outskirts of Guwahati—10 days ahead of counting of votes. Over 60 of the total 95 candidates of the party moved to the Dichang Resort located at Sonapur, 24 km away from Guwahati where they are likely to reside till May 2. Congress has booked 70 rooms in the resort. Some Congress leaders admitted the move was necessitated due to fear of the candidates switching sides to the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Other candidates stated that it was meant for orientation and interactions to know each other. Earlier this month, two alliance partners of the Congress-led ‘Mahajot’ (grand alliance), All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF) and Bodoland Peoples’ Front (BPF), had moved most of their candidates to Congress-ruled Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh respectively. “We have to be afraid of BJP as they have in the past indulged in horse-trading in several states and formed or broken governments. We are afraid and that’s why we are taking preventive measures,” Assam Congress president Ripun Bora told journalists. Leader of Congress legislature party in the present assembly Debabrata Saikia said that the candidates were in the resort as asked by the state president to have discussions ahead of counting of votes. “What the Congress is doing is pure drama ahead of counting. They know they will lose the election and are blaming us of horse-trading. We don’t have to indulge in such activities as BJP on its own will secure majority and with our allies will reach around 85 seats,” BJP spokesperson Subhash Dutta said. In 2016, BJP had won 60 seats and formed the government with support of its allies Asom Gana Parishad (14) and Bodoland Peoples’ Front (12). The Congress had won 26 seats while AIUDF had won 13. This time, BPF has switched sides and joined the Congress led alliance. “We used to see such instances of legislators being kept holed up in resorts in other states. Now Assam is also witnessing such events. This is not good for democracy and an insult to voters,” Akhil Ranjan Dutta, professor of political science in Gauhati University said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ten-days-before-counting-assam-congress-moves-candidates-to-a-resort-101619108031792.html
22-04-2021||India||India among few countries to respect commitments to Paris agreement: Indian envoy||India’s ambassador to France, Jawed Ashraf, on Thursday said that the world cannot afford to ignore the “long term pandemic” of climate change even as it is preoccupied with coronavirus disease (Covid-19). In an opinion piece for French daily Le Figaro, Ashraf highlighted the progress made by India on the climate action front, saying the country is on course to meet, and even exceed its commitments to Paris Agreement. He opined that although the world is falling short on its commitment, there are success stories of bold and imaginative action from large as well as small countries that “should inspire us”.“India has already achieved 25% reduction in energy intensity over 2005 level, and is on its way to doing more than our commitment of 33-35% reduction in 2030,” the Indian envoy wrote.Prime Minister Narendra Modi made climate change a national mission since he took the office in 2014, the ambassador said. He further added that PM Modi’s strategy to mitigate the risk of climate change rests on four pillars, including raising national consciousness on climate change, managing the demand side for fossil fuel and electricity, and emphasising biodiversity conservation.“At the heart of India’s strategy is making clean energy reliable, accessible and affordable. That belief also guided Prime Minister Modi’s call for International Solar Alliance, launched in Paris in 2015 with France as a co-founder, which now has nearly 90 member countries,” he wrote.Ashraf underscored the importance of international partnerships, saying climate change needs the same urgency that was visible in the efforts to develop, produce and distribute Covid-19 vaccines globally at affordable prices. He also stressed that advanced economies must do more to “meet their own commitments and to help the developing world.”“That means investing heavily in technologies and making them widely available as global public goods, backed by significantly higher commitment of financial resources for the developing world,” he added.On Thursday, PM Modi announced the launch of the “India-US climate and clean energy Agenda 2030 partnership” to “mobilise investments, demonstrate clean technologies and enable green collaborations”. Addressing the virtual summit of 40 world leaders hosted by US President Joe Biden, the prime minister called for a concrete action “at a high speed, on a large scale, and with a global scope” to combat climate change.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-among-few-countries-to-meet-commitments-to-paris-agreement-indian-envoy-101619106997306.html
22-04-2021||India||Covid-19: Incorrect facts, says Centre on media reports on SII vaccines||The Central government clarified on Thursday media reports that the Pune-based Serum Institute of India (SII) had contracted its entire production of vaccines against the coronavirus disease (covid-19) to it till May 25.Also Read | Serum Institute announces Covishield price: ₹600 for pvt, ₹400 for govt hospitals“There have been some media reports suggesting that SII has contracted all its production till 25th May 2021 to the Centre, and therefore till that date state governments will not be able to procure vaccine from SII,” the Centre said in a press release on Thursday evening. “These media reports are based on incorrect facts,” the release further said.Explaining the “contract,” the government said, “A key feature of the Liberalised Pricing And Accelerated National Covid-19 Vaccination Strategy is that the vaccine manufacturers would supply 50% of their monthly Central Drugs Laboratory (CDL) released doses to the Government of India and would be free to supply the remaining 50% doses to state governments and in the other than Government of India channel. The state governments are free to purchase the vaccine doses from the vaccine manufacturers.”Therefore, it is very clear that every month out of the total CDL cleared doses available with any vaccine manufacturer, 50% doses would be available for other than Government of India channels, the release added.Amid a rapid surge in daily cases of the viral disease, the Centre on Monday announced that starting May 1, everyone who is 18 or above will be eligible to be vaccinated against Covid-19. This will be the third phase of the nationwide vaccine drive, which is the largest globally, and began on January 16. SII is manufacturing one of two vaccine jabs cleared for use in India, the Oxford University-AstraZeneca shot, which is being manufactured here as “Covishield.”Also Read | What changes from May 1 in Covid-19 vaccination drive?The other shot is called Covaxin, and has been developed by the Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech International Limited. It is India’s first, and thus far only, home-made jab against Covid-19. Both Covaxin and Covishield were granted emergency use authorisation (EUA) by the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) in January.

The ICMR has partnered with IIT-Kanpur for the project.The Centre said in a release that the exemption will be valid for a period of one year or until further orders.The ICMR had filed an application in February seeking permission to conduct a feasibility study to deliver Covid-19 vaccines using drones. The government said that the medical research body will have to get clearance on its standard operating procedures (SOPs) from the DGCA.As per the release, conditional exemption has also been granted to a few entities and civic bodies to carry out study of using drones. These are: the municipal corporations of Dehradun, Haldwani, Haridwar and Rudrapur for preparation of GIS based property database and electronic tax register; the Kota and Katni divisions of West Central Railway for train accident site and maintaining safety and security of the railway assets.Drones have been very useful in providing last mile deliveries, and reaching places which are difficult to ac. In India, they have been used by authorities in some cities to keep a check at crowd when the Covid-19 pandemic spread last year.In Ghana, a delivery service Zipline has been using drones to give Covid-19 vaccines to people living in remote areas. According to a report in Forbes, Zipline has partnered with the government of Ghana to provide these vaccines which have been received as part of COVAX - a global initiative to give equitable access to Covid-19 vaccines.

22-04-2021||India||Vaccinating everyone above 18 years of age to cost 0.36% of GDP: India Ratings||Vaccinating all citizens above the age of 18 years against Covid-19 will cost ₹67,193 crore, of which states together will incur ₹46,323 crore, India Ratings and Research (Ind-Ra) said on Thursday.As the second wave of Covid-19 sweeps the country with alarming speed and severity, the government has announced a liberalised and accelerated Phase 3 strategy of Covid-19 vaccination. Under this scheme, all persons above 18 years of age will be eligible to get Covid-19 vaccine doses from May 1."This means that the total size of the population that will now be eligible for vaccination would be 84.19 crore out of the total population of 133.26 crore," it said a note.India Ratings calculated that this "may cost ₹67,193 crore, of which the Union government will incur ₹20,870 crore and state governments together will incur ₹46,323 crore".The government has made the pricing, procurement, eligibility and administration of coronavirus vaccines flexible. While the vaccination drive will continue as before, providing free vaccination to priority populations such as healthcare workers, frontline workers and population above 45 years of age, states and Union territories have been allowed to procure additional Covid-19 vaccine doses directly from the manufacturers and open-up vaccination to people above the age of 18 years.As a result, Indian vaccine manufacturers would now be supplying 50 per cent of their production to the central government and the balance 50 per cent would be available for procurement by the state governments and the open market (private hospitals).Ind-Ra said the Union government has already spent ₹5,090 crore on procuring 21.4 crore vaccines from Serum Institute of India and Bharat Biotech.Assuming two doses of vaccines at ₹400 per dose for new vaccine procurement and 5 per cent wastage, the cost for the central government will come to ₹62,103 crore for 155.4 crore doses, it said.The total of the two comes to ₹67,193 crore which "works out to be just 0.36 per cent of GDP," it noted. "If we split it between the Union government and state governments, then the fiscal impact on the union budget would be 0.12 per cent of GDP and on the state budgets would 0.24 per cent of GDP".The maximum impact is likely to be on Bihar (0.60 per cent of gross state domestic product or GSDP), followed by Uttar Pradesh (0.47 per cent), Jharkhand (0.37 per cent), Manipur (0.36 per cent), Assam (0.35 per cent), Madhya Pradesh (0.30 per cent) and Odisha (0.30 per cent)."Since the antibodies generated by these vaccines are likely to last for 12-18 months, this expenditure would be a recurring expenditure on union and state budgets," it said. "However, many states such as Kerala, Chhattisgarh, Bihar and Madhya Pradesh have already announced that the government will bear the cost of vaccination. Vaccinations by large corporate groups will reduce pressure on the state/central budget."Ind-Ra believes that given the magnitude of the problem and the economic cost the second wave of Covid-19 pandemic is likely to inflict on the economy, it is too small an amount."However, more than the money spent, the critical factor would be how soon the desired level of vaccination can be achieved."Therefore, the decision to allow the restricted emergency use of Russian vaccine Sputnik-V and other vaccines approved by the US, EU and WHO is another step in the right direction. This will only accelerate the vaccination effort in the country. The first batch of Sputnik V is expected to be delivered to India by April-end," it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vaccinating-everyone-above-18-years-of-age-to-cost-0-36-of-gdp-india-ratings-101619101395868.html

The strain B.1.617 was detected in passengers who landed at the Dibrugarh airport. The state had earlier recorded the UK variant of the virus. “We have found a patient with the Indian double mutant strain of Covid-19 at Dibrugarh during tests conducted on incoming passengers. This strain spreads very fast and is more dangerous. Hence, I request the public to be more careful,” said Sarma. The minister informed that though there is an increase in the number of Covid-19 cases in recent days, the state has adequate infrastructure and logistics to tackle the rise in patients. “We have adequate supply of oxygen, Remdesivir injections as well as ICU beds. If there is a huge surge in patients in coming days, there could be problems. But at present there is no scarcity,” said Sarma. On Wednesday, Assam recorded 1665 new cases and 5 Covid-19 deaths. The state has 9,048 active cases at present. In view of rising cases, the state government has made testing and seven-day home quarantine of all incoming passengers mandatory. On Thursday, Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal had an all-party meeting with leaders of most political parties in the state to discuss the present situation and take suggestions from them. “I appeal to all to strictly follow all the guidelines issued by the health department in tackling Covid-19. People have to be aware that unless we take the safety measures seriously, the situation might go out of control,” Sonowal said after the meeting. According to a state government release, leaders of all political parties appreciated the measures initiated by the state government to control the spread of the virus and assured all support as and when needed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indian-double-mutant-strain-of-covid-19-detected-in-assam-101619101010929.html

The Sardar Patel Covid Care Centre was the world's largest; it was closed down in February.People aware of the development said that the centre is expected to be operational in three days. As many as 11,657 patients were treated by the facility in seven-and-half months.On Thursday, the Union home ministry (MHA) released a letter which said that the Delhi government had requested for reopening of the facility. It also said that a deliberation took place on Thursday evening by ITBP officials with all the stakeholders.The MHA has designated ITBP as the nodal force for operating the facility."It has been decided to provide an adequate number of medical officers and para-medical staff to man 500 oxygenated beds to Sardar Patel Covid centre, Chhattarpur in Delhi," the MHA said in the letter.The home ministry also said that it has been decided to provide adequate number of medical officers and paramedical staff to man 500 oxygenated beds at the facility. The ITBP may draw required medical manpower, if needed, from other central police forces also, the MHA letter further said."The boarding and lodging arrangements for doctors and paramedical staff, including expenses, thereon will be made by Govt of NCT of Delhi," the MHA letter said.Inaugurated in July 5, 2020, the Sardar Patel centre was serving as a treatment centre for those who are asymptomatic but cannot afford home isolation.The ITBP had started the facility as an emergency measure when the country, as well as the national capital, was reeling under the impact of Covid-19 pandemic. The world's largest Covid-19 care centre admitted patients referred by 11 hospitals in Delhi, including AIIMS, Safdarjung, Medanta and Max Hospital.The number of patients being treated at the centre during the peak of the infection was 2,000.The Sardar Patel Covid Care Centre is 1,700 feet long, 700 feet wide - roughly the size of 20 football fields - and has 200 enclosures with 50 beds each.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/as-covid-19-cases-surge-itbp-to-reopen-sardar-patel-care-centre-in-delhi-101619100012448.html
22-04-2021||India||As the second Covid wave surges, how citizens are working to counter it||As India deals with the paucity of oxygen cylinders, plasma donors, food and other basic essentials during the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, young citizens are working to help those in need. Hindustan Times spoke to these young change-makers to understand their struggle and contribution in flattening the curve. Vinum Gupta: Delivers home-made food to patientsVinum Gupta distributes home-made meals around Gurugram in Haryana at minimal prices. He says he and his mother decided to start the service when they could not find anyone to provide them with food while they were infected with Covid-19.“My friend’s father fell ill. By the time we took him to the hospital, he passed away due to severe damage in his lungs. After we returned home, we felt sick and tested positive for Covid-19. That is when our struggle with food started. We didn’t have any known source which could provide us with food. After recovering, my mother and I realised that there were several people facing the same problem and we decided to start our food service,” says Gupta. “My mother and I started delivering lentils, chapatis and salad at a cost of ₹100 per plate in April. We provide free delivery within a 3km radius and a nominal delivery charge if it’s farther away,” says Gupta, who has successfully served 100 meals till date.

After her family tested positive, Vasuki and her husband split duties-- from cooking food to buying medicines. She then realised that since the members of sexual minority communities are subject to discrimination, the pandemic would have worsened the situation. “There are around 100 sex workers in different collectives in Mysore and Mandya and they needed care packages and meals. I was constantly using my Instagram account to look for members of sexual minority communities who needed help. I’ve been successful in serving around 150 beneficiaries who we supply food and other sanitary essentials,” says Vasuki, who started giving out care packages through her dog Duke’s Instagram account as well.Rana Mukherjee: Helps provide food, oxygen and monetary donations to patientsRana Mukherjee, an engineer from Korba in Chattisgarh, has not just been providing patients with meals, but is constantly working towards connecting donors and providing those in need with providing oxygen cylinders to those in need. Mukherjee and his friends have also cremated bodies when needed. “We cremated two unidentified bodies during the second wave. They had been lying in the hospital unattended,” says Mukherjee. “When the pandemic began in 2020, I interacted with migrants from all around India and their losses and suffering motivated me to help. We have a list of plasma donors and collaborate with multiple home chefs to provide two meals to over 220 people everyday. We constantly receive monetary donations from our acquaintances and the families in Chhattisgarh, which has helped us serve people during these uncertain times,” says Mukherjee .Surabhi Shikha: Works to verify a repository of Covid-19 resourcesSurabhi Shikha, from Patna in Bihar, with a following of 300 people on Instagram, has created a long list of verified resources for Covid-19 patients. “Since we live in this echo chamber where lots of info is being shared, we tend to feel that there’s enough resources. However, not a lot of people who are actually going through illness are aware that such initiatives are available,” says Shikha. “Both my parents are doctors in Patna and I’m watching the battlefield from the closest seat, so this is my little effort to do whatever I can to help. I research the contacts, and call vendors to confirm their inventory. It’s helpful that there are other people like me who are out there working on similar initiatives. I’m on the constant lookout for what’s being shared across different cities,” says Shikha, who spends around four or five hours of her day verifying sources and has successfully created a guide for all the requirements a Covid-19 patient might need.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/as-the-second-covid-wave-surges-how-citizens-are-working-to-counter-it-101619099270629.html

India is extending its full support to the ongoing Indonesian rescue efforts," Singh tweeted.Singh said India is always committed to assist its strategic partners during times of need and that Gen Subianto has acknowledged and appreciated India's support to his country."I have already directed the @indiannavy to move its Deep Submergence Rescue Vessel (DSRV) to Indonesia. I have also tasked the Indian Air Force to see the feasibility of induction of the DSRV intervention system by air," he said.Earlier, Indian Navy spokesperson Commander Vivek Madhwal said India is among a few countries globally which are capable of undertaking search and rescue of a disabled submarine through a DSRV.He said the Indian Navy's DSRV system can locate any submarine at a depth of 1,000 metres utilising its state of the art side scan sonar (SSS) and remotely operated vehicle (ROV)."After the submarine is successfully located, another sub module of DSRV- the submarine rescue vehicle (SRV) - mates with the submarine to rescue the trapped personnel. The SRV can also be used to provide emergency supplies to the submarine," he said.Under the framework of comprehensive strategic partnership between India and Indonesia, the two navies share a strong partnership of operational cooperation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajnath-singh-speaks-to-indonesian-defence-minister-assures-support-to-trace-missing-submarine-101619096869036.html
22-04-2021||India||Jammu and Kashmir doctor asks social groups to prepare for 2nd Covid-19 wave||Baramulla government medical hospital superintendent raised an alarm on Thursday, asking social organisations and religious groups to prepare to deal with the possibility of the second Covid-19 wave overwhelming the health infrastructure in Jammu and Kashmir, as witnessed in pockets of states such as Maharashtra and Delhi. His post on social media created a flutter and received backing from a few other prominent personalities at a time when senior officials have said there was no need to panic.“All Masjid / Mohalla committees should arrange oxygen facilities in their respective mohallas instead of other community requirements this time. A disastrous wave is on its way. This little time should be used to build these small domiciliary facilities which will help the system from overloading,” Syed Masood, superintendent Government Medical College (GMC) hospital Baramulla wrote on social media on Thursday. The post was widely shared and evoked a response from some organisations who said they were following up on the advice.There are dozens of voluntary organisations supplying oxygen concentrators and other equipment to the needy across the UT, especially in Srinagar. Mudasir Naqashbandi, an advocate who runs Khidmat Foundation has been arranging oxygen for Covid patients. He claims there is a “worst kind of shortage of concentrators” in north Kashmir claiming the demand has increased “abruptly”. “We are appealing to people to help us in purchasing new oxygen concentrators, we don’t want a condition [as seen in] other places... in Kashmir. [Other places are] facing shortage of oxygen and we can’t afford to lose our people due to oxygen supply.”On Wednesday at least 22 Covid patients died in a municipality-run hospital in Maharashtra’s Nashik due to leakage of oxygen . Several hospitals in Delhi and Maharashtra have raised alarm over oxygen supplies reaching critical levels presenting a life-threatening risk to patients.“We still have days... we can plug the gaps in the system. The government and people should take this very seriously, otherwise we could also land in trouble like other states of the country, where patients are dying for want of oxygen,” said a senior doctor posted at government medical college (GMC) Srinagar, who didn’t wish to be named.With 2,204 fresh cases, Jammu and Kashmir on Wednesday again reported the highest ever daily count of infections since the outbreak. The number of cases recorded in the first 20 days of April in the second wave this year reached 21,482 – the second highest after September, 2020, when the first wave peaked. Total number of Covid-19 positive cases in the UT has reached 152,442. Three deaths in Kashmir and 10 in Jammu were reported on Wednesday, taking the total death to 2,084, health officials said. This is the highest daily death count in the UT since the first week of October.Last week, medical superintendent, GMC Anantnag, Dr Iqbal said his hospital was left with no vacant ICU beds for Covid patients. The GMC Anantnag caters to the entire south Kashmir. On Tuesday, director SKIMS (Sher-I-Kashmir Institute of Medical Sciences) AG Ahangar claimed Remdesivir injection- used to treat severe cases- was running short for the past two days.However, on Tuesday, financial commissioner, health Atal Dulloo ruled out a shortage of any medicine including Remdesivir and assured that there were sufficient beds and oxygen across the UT. On the same day Jammu and Kashmir’s top pulmonologist Dr Javaid Malik said the UT was better prepared than last year, however, he also stressed the need to develop health infrastructure in “a big way” across the union territory to meet the “future” emergencies.Another senior government official in the valley, divisional commissioner Pandurang K Pole, said not even 30% of the 1,500 Covid beds available in level 1 and level 2 health facilities in the UT were occupied. Another official, who didn’t wish to be named, said six wards at the government-run Shri Maharaja Hari Singh (SMHS) hospital in Srinagar were designated as Covid wards, similarly, more than 100 beds at the Covid centre created at the indoor stadium at Baramulla have been made operational and more beds have been designated for treatment of Covid-19 patients at the SKIMS.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jammu-and-kashmir-doctor-asks-social-groups-to-prepare-for-2nd-covid-19-wave-101619097951547.html
22-04-2021||India||'Mortality much higher': Doctor who highlighted horrors of 2nd Covid wave||A doctor who highlighted the horrors of working during the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic, has now said that the second wave of the infection is deadlier than the first one. Dr Saandhra Sebastian appealed to the people to follow precautions to keep themselves safe during these testing times."Since March 30, the Covid-19 caseload has been very high. It is very difficult to handle the sheer number of cases. Such a high number of cases are actually putting a burden on the healthcare system," Dr Sebastian said during a an interaction with Humans Of Bombay on Instagram."We are having to refuse patients, saying we do not have oxygen beds or ICU beds. The mortality this time is higher, much higher," the doctor added.A post shared by Humans of Bombay (@officialhumansofbombay)Dr Sebastian's post last week where she shared the plight of healthcare workers at Covid-19 hospitals and the disturbing episodes they witness as people break down when told about the condition of their family members had gone viral on social media.Today, during the Instagram interaction, the young doctor talked about the precautions to be followed if someone is isolating at home after testing positive for Covid-19."After you test positive, maintain your diet and proper hydration. If you are having fever, take paracetamol as and when there are spikes. If you have fever throughout the day, you can take paracetamol thrice a day. Keep taking Vitamin C and zinc once daily. If you have sore throat or chest congestion, take levocetirizine before you go to bed," said Dr Sebastian.She also said that it's only a speculation that the Sars-CoV-2 virus - which causes Covid-19 - is airborne.When asked about breathing exercises, the doctor said that if a patient is feeling shortness of breath, it means the disease has turned moderate from mild. So it's better to get yourself hospitalised."Take Vitamin C tablets even if you don't have Covid. Healthcare workers like us, who are engaged in duties, are also asked to take Vitamin C daily. If Vitamin C level goes down, the capacity of the body to fight infection is impaired," said the Delhi-based anesthesiology resident.The doctor also informed that she completed her Covid duty on April 18 and is presently under quarantine.In her Instragram post on April 14, Dr Sebastian gave a glimpse of the past two weeks of her life.“I've been telling people that their 22-year-old son has died, lying to patients, telling them theek ho jaoge (you will getter better), when I know to my bones vo theek nhi honge… (they won’t getter better), hearing breathless women crying allah allah in anguish all night,” she said in the long post.She also urged people to follow Covid-appropriate behaviour and wear mask when they go out.India recorded the world's highest daily tally of 314,835 new Covid-19 infections on Thursday as a second wave of the pandemic raised new fears about the ability of crumbling health services to cope.Health officials across northern and western India including the capital, New Delhi, said they were in crisis, with most hospitals full and running out of oxygen.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mortality-much-higher-doctor-who-highlighted-horrors-at-2nd-covid-wave-101619096851577.html
22-04-2021||India||As Covid cases and deaths rise in Chhattisgarh, BJP blames govt mismanagement||With 193 deaths and 14,519 fresh cases of Covid-19 reported in Chhattisgarh on Wednesday, the opposition party in state Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) alleged that the state is suffering from lack of testing kits and hospital beds due to mismanagement. Raipur is the worst-hit city with 17,981 cases recorded in the last seven days, followed by Durg which recorded 10,381 cases recorded in the same period. On Wednesday, Raipur recorded 3,081 cases and 68 deaths due to Covid-19, which suggest the government has failed to contain the surge of Covid-19 in the state. “Although the number of fresh cases in Raipur has gone down from about 5,000 to 3,000, the number of deaths is not decreasing. In the last one week, 470 people died in government and private hospitals. The main reason is people from neighbouring district come to Raipur for treatment. Now the cases in rural districts of the state are increasing, which is a major concern,” said a health official. Also Read | People above 18 will get free Covid vaccine in state: Chhattisgarh CM BaghelMeanwhile, Raipur and other affected districts of the state are suffering from the lack of hospital beds. “ I had to wait around 24 hours for a ventilator bed in Raipur for my mother and at last with the help of some volunteers , I got a bed in a private hospital ,” said Naveet Verma, who himself is battling Covid-19 for last few days. On Wednesday, the health department served a notice to seven laboratories for the delay in timely update of Covid-19 test figures on the ICMR portal. “The infection rate has increased four times in Chhattisgarh in the last four weeks. We are trying to increase the testing in the state and presently we are conducting around 13,000 RT-PCR tests per day. We are also trying to increase the number of testing labs from 8 to 17. The number of deaths has increased because patients are reaching the hospital very late,” said health minister TS Singhdeo, talking to media. The minister also said that there is no crunch in oxygen supply but there is a lack of ICU beds, and the department is working to fix that. “Deaths are more worrying because the rate is more than one per cent. This because the infection is more in the state ... We hope it will come down in next seven days,” Singhdeo said. Meanwhile, former chief minister and senior BJP leader Raman Singh alleged that people in the state are suffering due to lack of testing as well as oxygen and ICU beds. “Testing has stopped in the whole state because testing kits are not available. People are not tested in rural areas. In urban areas, people are getting beds... This is apathy and negligence of state government,” he alleged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/as-covid-cases-and-deaths-rise-in-chhattisgarh-bjp-blames-govt-mismanagement-101619096691724.html
22-04-2021||India||Chhattisgarh CM Bhupesh Baghel writes to PM Modi, seeks details on supply, prices of vaccines||Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel on Thursday wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeking immediate information on the availability and cost of vaccines to be provided to the state as part of the third phase of the Covid-19 vaccination drive due to begin on May 1, according to officials.The chief minister in his letter said that in perspective of the Centre’s decision of allowing everyone above 18 years of age to get vaccinated against Covid-19, the state government has decided to arrange free of cost vaccines for its people in addition to the vaccines available by the Government of India. Stating that there are only a few days left for commencement of the third phase of the vaccination drive, Baghel said it is necessary to prepare a detailed action plan before organising a vaccination drive at such a huge scale. Baghel also sought information regarding the number of vaccines to be provided monthly to the state by the Centre, approximate number of vaccines to be provided to the state monthly by the Serum Institute and Bharat Biotech and the cost of vaccines provided to the Centre and states by SII and Bharat Biotech. The chief minister further wrote that it is expected that the cost of vaccines should be uniform for the Centre as well as states. Since, Covaxin has been developed with assistance from the Government of India therefore, Bharat Biotech should supply its vaccines at lesser rates compared to the one by Serum Institute. He said a uniform price of vaccines would be justified as both the state and the Centre earn revenue from tax payers money.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chhattisgarh-cm-bhupesh-baghel-writes-to-pm-modi-seeks-details-on-supply-prices-of-vaccines-101619096690433.html
22-04-2021||India||'Timely reminder of grave threat': PM Modi tells Leaders’ Summit on Climate||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday said the Leaders’ Summit on Climate is a timely reminder that the grave threat posed by climate change has not disappeared even as humanity battles coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic. Speaking at the two-day virtual summit, the prime minister highlighted that climate change is a lived reality for millions around the world, and their lives and livelihoods are already facing adverse consequences."To combat climate change, concrete action is needed. We need such action at a high speed on a large scale and with a global scope. We, in India, are doing our part. Our ambitious renewable energy target of 450 gigawatts by 2030 shows our commitment," said PM Modi.The prime minister announced that he and US President Joe Biden are launching the “India-US climate and clean energy Agenda 2030 partnership” to create templates of sustainable development. He said the two countries will help mobilise investments, demonstrate clean technologies, and enable green collaborations.Highlighting India’s lower per capita carbon footprint as compared to the global average, Modi argued that the lifestyle of Indians “rooted in sustainable traditional practices” has helped the cause. He emphasised the importance of “lifestyle change in climate action”."Despite our development challenges, we have taken many bold steps on clean energy, energy efficiency, afforestation and biodiversity. That's why we are among the few countries whose indices are 2-degree celsius compatible," he added.The summit is being hosted by the US president who earlier committed to reducing the country's greenhouse gas emissions by 50%-52% below its 2005 emissions levels. Opening the Leaders' Summit on Climate, Biden laid out his vision for a greener economy with a focus on more for the blue-collar workers."That's where we're headed as a nation, and that's what we can do if we take action to build an economy that's not only more prosperous but healthier, fairer and cleaner for the entire planet," Biden said."These steps will set America's economy to net-zero emissions by no later than 2050," he added.The Leaders’ Summit on Climate is one of several major climate-related events in the run-up to COP-26, a global event scheduled for November 2021. Biden had invited 40 global leaders including Chinese President Xi Jinping, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, and Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, among others.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/timely-reminder-of-grave-threat-pm-modi-tells-leaders-summit-on-climate-101619095660767.html
22-04-2021||India||SC seeks plan on measures to face national health emergency||The Supreme Court on Thursday asked the Centre to present before it a national plan on Friday elaborating the measures it has adopted and proposes to take to face the national emergency while taking a suo moto (on its own) cognisance of the crisis triggered by the second Covid-19 wave. The surge in infections has led to a shortage of hospital beds and crucial supplies such as medical oxygen and medicines.A Chief Justice of India SA Bobde-led bench asked solicitor general Tushar Mehta to remain present in the court with the plan as it said the court will monitor the steps being taken by the Centre to ensure sufficient and equitable supply of medical oxygen and medicines across the country. The bench appointed senior advocate Harish Salve as amicus curiae to assist the court in the matter. It asked him to provide suggestions after examining the Centre’s plan.The bench, which also includes justices L Nageswara Rao and S Ravindra Bhat, pointed out that at least six high courts were hearing issues related to the preparedness of the states and the Centre to deal with the crisis.Also Read | All you need to know about CJI-designate Ramana“They are exercising jurisdiction in the best interest, but it is creating confusion and diversion of resources because of their priorities. One high court thinks there is a priority for one group and some for another. So, we as the Supreme Court, wish to take suo moto cognisance of certain issues,” Bobde told Mehta.The bench listed out its focus areas – supply of medical oxygen, essential medicines, method and manner of vaccination, and the power of a court to order a lockdown to check the pandemic spread.The Supreme Court on Tuesday stayed an order of the Allahabad high court for virtually locking down five worst-hit districts of Uttar Pradesh. On the issue of lockdown, Bobde on Thursday observed that this authority should be with the state government. “We want to keep the power to declare lockdown with states. It cannot be a judicial decision. We will, for the moment, issue notice to the Centre on these four issues,” said Bobde while asking for the national plan on Friday, which happens to be his last working day before he retires.When Mehta asked if the Centre was still required to make submissions before the high courts after the top court’s cognisance, Bhat said that the government should go ahead and adduce its national plan before high courts. Bhat said the idea was not to supersede high court orders at this moment. Bobde said it was perhaps a better idea for the Supreme Court to hear everything together and the matters before the high courts could be transferred to it.Mehta said the Centre will for now inform the high courts about the pendency of the matter before the Supreme Court.Salve, who was present in the court on behalf of Vedanta with a request for reopening its Sterlite Copper plant in Tamil Nadu’sThoothukudi to produce and supply oxygen for Covid-19 patients, said people were dying every day. “We want this permission only for starting the oxygen plant. And we will supply it free of cost. Give us the permission today and we can start producing it in 5-6 days.”The plant was shut down in May 2018 after 13 civilians were shot dead in the anti-Sterlite protests in Thoothukudi. The Madras high court in August 2020 rejected Vedanta’s petition to reopen the plant, citing environmental concerns. The Supreme Court has also rejected requests to reopen the plant for a trial run.Salve said Vedanta was pleading only for making the oxygen plant in Thoothukudi functional so that it could provide thousands of tonnes of oxygen for medical purposes.Mehta cited the dire need for medical oxygen and added the Centre was augmenting its supply from all possible sources. “Let Vedanta operate its plant only for the purpose of producing oxygen and this will be diverted only for medical purposes. Sooner the plant starts functioning, better for the country.”Senior advocate CS Vaidyanathan, who represented the Tamil Nadu government, said there was a “trust deficit” with Vedanta. He added the violations for which the plant was shut could not be ignored. The state government opposed any urgent hearing of Vedanta’s application.Bobde questioned the Tamil Nadu government’s attitude. “What is this attitude? You are not manufacturing it [oxygen] and you will be getting it free of cost for your medical emergencies. We will make sure they follow all environmental norms, but we do not appreciate your attitude. This is a national emergency. Do not throw spokes like this,” Bobde told Vaidyanathan, while fixing the hearing into the matter on Friday.Mehta said between protecting human life and the environment, they must lean toward protecting human lives.Oxygen is a critical medical intervention against Covid-19, which causes respiratory distress in some cases. The pandemic has accelerated the global demand for it. The need for oxygen has increased to 1.1 million cylinders in low to middle-income countries alone, according to the World Health Organisation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-seeks-plan-on-measures-to-face-national-health-emergency-101619094650902.html

We have requested the Centre to increase the number of beds in their hospitals to 7,000. Currently, there are 2,000 beds in Central government hospitals. The Centre will increase 700 to 800 ICU beds soon,” said Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain.He added that more beds will be available in the city as soon as the oxygen crisis is sorted out. “There is a shortage of oxygen for the last three days; yesterday the Centre increased Delhi’s allocation from 378 MT to 480 MT. There is no oxygen production in Delhi; the supply comes from the big plants of other states. But there was a crisis yesterday as some states were stopping the vehicles (carrying oxygen). The situation is not comfortable yet. Once the oxygen crisis ends, we can add a lot of beds,” he said. On Wednesday, the minister had said that preparations were going on to convert Burari ground into a 1,000-bed Covid-19 facility.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-to-add-nearly-800-icu-beds-to-govt-hospitals-in-delhi-satyendar-jain-101619093930294.html
22-04-2021||India||Congress blames BJP for ‘deliberately enabling’ Covid crisis in Gujarat||Congress on Thursday lashed out at the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) for “deliberately enabling” the rise of Covid-19 cases in Gujarat and “creating a huge medical crisis in the state”.In a press conference chaired by All India Congress Committee (AICC) Gujarat in-charge Rajeev Satav, Congress blamed the BJP government for creating a crisis in Gujarat by conducting the cricket matches at Narendra Modi Stadium despite the imminent threat of the virus spreading in the state.Congress MLAs Paresh Dhanani and Amit Chavda were also a part of the conference that was held via video.“There is a crisis in the state. First, they conducted the Namaste Trump event and got thousands infected, and later they held cricket matches amid rising cases. Today there is hardly any oxygen bed available in the state, 14 districts don’t even have a CT scan or RT-PCR test available. It’s a government-made disaster in the state which is being showcased as the crown Gujarat Model all around the country,” Satav said.Also Read | Top central govt official steps in to ensure smoother interstate oxygen movementHitting out at the state in-charge of BJP, Satav said that if the government in its affidavit to Gujarat high court agreed that there was a severe shortage of the remdesivir in the state, how were there 10,000 remdesivir injections in the possession of its state president and other BJP leaders.MLA Paresh Dhanani from Amreli, Gujarat, also blamed the BJP for creating an artificial shortage of remdesivir in the state.“They stockpiled the remdesivir at the time of a medical emergency and created a shortage only to showcase themselves later as messiahs by distributing the hoarded medicine,” Dhanani said.Earlier, Dhanani had also filed a public interest litigation (PIL) in the Gujarat high court for “illegal and unauthorised distribution of remdesivir injection” at the BJP’s Surat office.Blaming the state government for mismanagement and the home minister and Prime Minister for ignoring their home constituencies, Satav added that the state government was acting insensitively.“The government recently said that there was no shortage of hospital beds and patients were being too choosy about hospitals, it’s very insensitive on their part. There is no oxygen in the state, ventilators are unavailable. Our leaders have written over 387 letters to BJP, but there has hardly been any response. It is horrific that a state which has a double-engine government with BJP at the Centre cannot get access to basic healthcare,” Satav said.Amit Chavda, the Congress MLA from Anklav consistency, also slammed the state government for their mismanagement of the situation. Chavda accused the state government of masking the actual Covid-19 figures in the state.“If we go by the figures of the state government, the total number of infected people in the state is not over 87,000, which accounts for just 0.5% of the total population. Is the situation of healthcare infrastructure so bad that it could not even stand a medical emergency of just 0.5% of its population?” Chavda questioned, adding that for the first time in the history of Gujarat so many people had died because of the irresponsibility of the state government.Meanwhile, BJP called the allegations “baseless and politically motivated”.Speaking to Hindustan Times, BJP’s national spokesperson Syed Zafar Islam said that BJP leaders were committed to serving the people in any crisis and the allegations levelled by Congress were not just meant to degrade BJP’s spirit of service but to hide their own incapacities.Reacting on whether stationing these medicines at party offices was right given the acute shortage in hospitals, Zafar said that the government was committed to lending the medical supply to the hospitals and by distributing the medicines from party offices, BJP was just assisting those who could not procure them outside hospitals.“There is a shortage issue and the work is being done to make the medicines available in bulk. However, distribution of medicines from the party offices does not qualify as hoarding and does not affect any supply of hospitals. It’s just an attempt to increase the availability of the medicines to people and help them,” Zafar said.India has reported over 300,000 Covid-19 cases and 2,104 deaths in the last 24 hours. This is the highest increase in the daily infections and deaths since the pandemic broke out.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-blames-bjp-for-deliberately-enabling-covid-crisis-in-gujarat-101619093750284.html
22-04-2021||India||Former MP deputy chief minister’s son arrested for killing brother with family||Former deputy chief minister of united Madhya Pradesh, Pyarelal Kanwar’s son, daughter-in-law, and five-year-old granddaughter were found murdered at their residence in Chhattisgarh’s Korba district on Wednesday morning, said police.Kanwar’s son Harish (45), his wife Sumitra (30) and daughter Aashi Kanwar (5) were killed by sharp-edged weapons, police said. Later, five persons, including Harish’s elder brother Harbhajan, Harbhajan’s wife Dhankuwar, brother in law Parmeshwar with his two aides—Ramprasad and Surendra, were arrested on the suspicion of plotting and executing the murder of their kin.Police said the killings were done over a monetary dispute in the family. A minor was also named in the case. Initial investigations suggest Harish was more influential of the two brothers and controlled the family’s finances, leading to Harbhajan developing a grudge against him, police said.“A scrutiny of the murder spot suggested violence possibly triggered by deep rage against the victim. They were also signs of struggle before the murder,” said Korba police chief, SP (superintendent of police) Abhishek Meena.CCTV footage showed Harbhajan, his wife and two daughters stepped out of the house, purportedly for a walk, around 4.15 am, and within minutes, two unidentified masked persons entered the house.“The killers didn’t kill Harish’s mother, which appeared strange. We later found that some time after the murders, Harbhajan’s brother-in-law Parmeshwar was admitted to a hospital on the same day. When we quizzed him, we got even more suspicious. Upon scrutiny of his phone, we found some messages sent to Harbhjan’s daughter, following which we detained him,” said the SP.Police said, Parmeshwar later confessed that he and his aide Ramprasad were waiting near the house since 4am and they entered the house after receiving a message from Harbhajan’s daughter and killed the trio.After his arrest, Parmeshwar told police that “monetary transactions between him and Harish” led to the murder, said the SP. Police are investigating the details.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/former-mp-deputy-chief-minister-s-son-arrested-for-killing-brother-with-family-101619093390182.html

22-04-2021||India||Woman accused of orchestrating solar scam arrested in Kerala||The Kerala police on Thursday arrested Saritha S Nair, who allegedly floated a fake solar energy company along with her husband, Biju Radhakrishnan, and cheated investors, for repeatedly ignoring summons of a local court in Kozhikode. The court earlier cancelled the couple’s bail and pulled up the police for not arresting them.The scam surfaced in 2013 after the couple floated the fictitious solar energy company called Team Solar and cheated many by seeking investments with the promise of making them business partners or offering to install solar power units. They allegedly flaunted their “high connections” to attract gullible investors.Kozhikode businessman Abdul Majeed filed a case against the couple in 2012 accusing them of taking ₹42.70 lakh from him for a franchise of their company besides installing solar panels in his office and house. But neither the contract was executed, nor the money refunded, the complainant said.Also Read | Kerala enforces more curbs as Covid-19 cases rise alarmingly, clamps night curfewThe couple is facing over 40 cases. They have been convicted in four and were out on bail. Oommen Chandy, the then chief minister of Kerala, sacked two of his private secretaries and the state public relations director for their alleged involvement in the scam.Nair later accused Congress leaders, including Chandy, of sexually harassing her. The Pinarayi Vijayan government in Kerala handed over this case to the Central Bureau of Investigation two months back but the agency is yet to take it up.A police complaint was also filed last year against Nair for allegedly accepting money to help some people get government jobs. Nair also tried to contest the 2019 Lok Sabha elections against Congress leader Rahul Gandhi in Wayanad, but her nomination papers were rejected as she had been convicted in two solar scam cases. In November, the Supreme Court rejected her plea challenging Gandhi’s election and fined her.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/woman-accused-of-orchestrating-solar-scam-arrested-in-kerala-101619091830125.html

He stressed the fact that state governments should come down heavily on hoarding of oxygen.The Centre is undertaking various steps to rapidly increase the availability of cryogenic tankers through conversion of nitrogen and argon tanks, import and airlifting of tankers as well as manufacturing them, the statement said.In a separate order, the Union home ministry said on Thursday there will be no restriction in the movement of oxygen and added the supply cannot be limited to a specific state or Union territory.Also Read| Kejriwal speaks to Khattar on oxygen supply, assured of full supportThe order comes after the Supreme Court took a suo motu cognisance of the prevailing pandemic situation in India regarding several points apart from oxygen supply such as supplies of essential drugs, vaccination etc and asked the Centre to present a national plan on all these areas.India on Thursday reported the world’s highest single day spike with over 314,000 cases in the last 24 hours, taking the caseload to nearly 16 million. The death toll has climbed to 184,657 after 2,104 more people succumbed to the disease.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/at-review-meet-pm-modi-gives-three-suggestions-to-boost-oxygen-availability-101619089393800.html
22-04-2021||India||Odisha logs new single-day high, says Covid 2nd wave may peak by May 1st week||The Odisha government on Wednesday hoped that the second wave of Covid-19 in the state will start ebbing after peaking between the end of April and first week of May even as the state hit a new record of 6,164 cases in a single day. One of the top most medical officers, however, ruled out any crisis, saying the state was well prepared.“The peak has already started in Maharashtra while Delhi and other states might see the climax by last week of April and in some states, it will (be) extended to May. In Odisha too, the peak might come between the end of April and first week of May. After that, the cases will decrease naturally at the same pace they are rising now,” said Dr CBK Mohanty, director of medical education and training.Dr Mohanty’s prediction coincides with the state reporting a record 6,164 new cases in a 24 hour period, taking the active Covid cases to 30,927. The previous single-day spike of 4,851 cases was recorded on April 21. Currently, with 14.34 test positivity rate (TPR) reported on Thursday and reproductive number (R0) at 2.39, officials said cases were doubling every five days while the TPR was doubling every 6 days.TPR is the ratio of tests performed to cases confirmed and the R0 or the reproductive number is an indication of the transmissibility of a virus, representing the average number of new infections generated by an infectious person. For R0 > 1, the number infected is likely to increase, and for R0 < 1, transmission is likely to die out.Renowned microbiologist Dr TM Mohapatra, who earlier worked with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), also agreed that the peak may come by the end of May first week or early second week. “In Odisha, the infections came from neighbouring Chhattisgarh and now migrant workers from Maharashtra and Delhi would bring more infections. I would not be surprised if the daily surge reaches 10,000 a day,” he said.Mohapatra however said Odisha may not be finding all its infected persons due to poor ratio of RT-PCR tests to the total number of tests done. “ICMR says states should conduct 70% of the tests through RT-PCR while in Odisha it is barely touching 40 per cent.”Dr Mohanty however said Odisha was prepared for the challenge presented by the second wave. “There is no shortage of oxygen stock for the infected in Odisha so far. Among the available beds at 70 dedicated Covid care hospitals in the state, only 26% general beds have been used. Similarly, only 14.18% intensive care units and 10% ventilators, respectively are in use now,” he said.Mohanty said Odisha has adequate medical oxygen suppliers which can meet the requirement easily. “During the first wave, the consumption of oxygen was 28 to 30 metric tonnes per day in the state. We do not see any shortage of oxygen supply,” he said.The All India Institute of Medical Sciences in Bhubaneswar decided to temporarily close its walk-in OPD services from April 26 in view of the sharp rise in Covid-19 cases among many of its staffers. The hospital however said day care services, radiotherapy, dialysis, trauma and emergency, life-saving surgery and immunization for old registered patients would continue.Meanwhile, members of local chamber of commerce, lawyers’ association, private bus union and leaders of various political parties in Raighar block of Nabarangpur district unanimously declared a five-day local shutdown on their own. Raighar chamber of commerce president Prasanta Panigrahi said the shutdown was announced since the block shares borders with Covid hotspot Chhattisgarh.Panigrahi said during the shutdown, all government and private institutions will remain closed. In the bordering Chandahandi block too, locals have closed markets in a bid to stem the spread of infections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-logs-new-single-day-high-says-covid-2nd-wave-may-peak-by-may-1st-week-101619089490270.html

22-04-2021||India||Offered India not-for-profit price for Covid-19 vaccine; to supply through govt contracts: Pfizer||Global pharma major Pfizer on Thursday said it has offered a not-for-profit price for its vaccine for the government immunisation programme in India and it remains committed to continuing engagement with the government to make the vaccine available in the country. The company also said during the pandemic phase it will supply the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 mRNA vaccine only through government contracts. "Pfizer remains committed to continuing our engagement with the Government towards making the Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine available for use in the government's immunization programme in the country", a Pfizer spokesperson said in an email response to PTI. As stated earlier, during this pandemic phase, Pfizer will prioritise supporting governments in their immunisation programmes and supply the Covid-19 vaccine only through government contracts based on agreements with respective government authorities and following regulatory authorisation or approvals, the statement added. The company, however, did not reveal the 'not-for-profit' price that it has suggested to the government. The company is committed to work for equitable and affordable access for its vaccine across the world, the Pfizer spokesperson said. "... in all our agreements Pfizer has adopted a distinct pricing structure for high, middle, and low/lower-middle-income countries consistent with our commitment to work towards equitable and affordable access for our Covid-19 vaccine for people around the world," the statement said. "For India, Pfizer has offered a not-for-profit price for its vaccine for the government immunization program", it added without revealing the price. The union government on Monday announced that everyone above 18 years of age would be eligible to get vaccinated against Covid-19 from May 1 as it liberalised the vaccination drive to allow states, private hospitals and industrial establishments to procure the vaccine doses directly from manufacturers. Under the third phase of the national vaccination drive commencing next month, the vaccine manufacturers would supply 50 per cent of their monthly Central Drugs Laboratory (CDL) released doses to the central government and would be free to supply the remaining 50 per cent doses to state governments and in the open markets.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/offered-india-not-for-profit-price-for-covid-19-vaccine-pfizer-101619088261344.html
22-04-2021||India||Top central govt official steps in to ensure smoother interstate oxygen movement||The Union home ministry has stepped in to ease the medical oxygen supply crisis reported from several regions this week, with top officials directly intervening in specific instances in which tankers were restricted by one state from going to another, a top officials told HT.The problem has been in focus since Tuesday night after some hospitals in Delhi ran out of supply or received replenishments with minutes to spare, prompting the state government to repeatedly raise the issue. Delhi has no large scale manufacturing of its own and has had to rely on Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand.“There were some issues with regard to the [oxygen] shortage, but we are sorting it out. During the day, some plants see some problems, but we are on it,” said Union home secretary Ajay Kumar Bhalla. “Whatever allotment has been made to states should be allowed to go.” Also Read | Covid-19 peddled as an excuse to stop protests against agri laws: Farmer leadersBhalla said the Centre is trying to reiterate a September 18, 2020, order that said no restrictions shall be imposed on oxygen manufacturers and suppliers to limit the supplies only to the hospitals of the state where they are located.The second wave of the Covid-19 outbreak has sparked shortages of hospital beds and other crucial supplies such as oxygen and medicines. Oxygen is a critical medical intervention against Covid-19, which causes respiratory distress in some cases. The pandemic has accelerated the global demand for it. The need for oxygen has increased to 1.1 million cylinders in low to middle-income countries alone, according to the World Health Organisation.All previous daily records were broken in India as it reported 315,909 Covid-19 cases on Wednesday. The country also reported the most single-day infections globally ever.All India Industrial Gases Manufacturers Association head Saket Tiku said Bhalla had to intervene in several cases as authorities in Haryana and Uttar Pradesh were among those disallowing free inter-state movement of oxygen.“Air Liquide [a manufacturer] is reporting that their trucks are lined up in Panipat to bring oxygen to Delhi, but a police team has reached and is not allowing the trucks to move,” said Tiku. Another manufacturer, Linde, has also sent a similar complaint to a control room in Delhi earlier.In its message, Linde said a senior drugs inspector reached its Faridabad plant with her team on Wednesday and was not allowing supplies to go to Delhi and National Capital Region (NCR). It added they were told the supply will go to only Haryana. “We supply 70 tpd of Medical Oxygen to all major government and private hospitals at Delhi-NCR which includes all the covid hospitals. Looking forward for your support to remove the restriction immediately to avoid any fatality,” said the message from Linde.Haryana deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala said he has no information of any such developments. But central government officials, who have mapped the oxygen needs nationally, are worried.“If people get parochial about oxygen, how will we manage,” said a member of an empowered group formed to deal with the situation. The group is meeting every two hours to assess the situation.Delhi’s deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia said at a press conference on Wednesday that it had to ask for Centre’s help on two occasions, when supply trucks were stuck in Haryana and Uttar Pradesh between Tuesday and Wednesday. “If we have to keep chasing each truck and ask Centre to intervene, then it’s not a very good situation,” he told reporters on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/top-central-govt-official-steps-in-to-ensure-smoother-interstate-oxygen-movement-101619087089916.html
22-04-2021||India||Himachal CM urges elected representatives to ensure welfare, well-being of people during Covid-19 pandemic||Himachal Pradesh Chief Minister Jai Ram Thakur on Thursday urged the elected representatives of Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) to ensure the welfare and wellbeing of the people of his or her area amid Covid-19 pandemic."It is the duty of any elected representative to ensure welfare and wellbeing of the people of his or her area. The coronavirus pandemic this time was not only spreading at a faster pace, but was also more fatal. Number of cases and deaths during the last about two months have increased at a rapid pace," the Chief Minister said in an statement.During a virtual address to the elected representatives of ULBs in Shimla, the Chief Minister asked them to remain in constant contact with the family members of the Covid-19 patients in home isolation in their areas so that they do not face any difficulty and also get proper medical counselling and treatment."Peoples' participation in checking spread of pandemic and helping them in distress that was visible last year was missing this time. The elected representatives of Urban Local Bodies to come forward to help the needy at the time of distress," the Chief Minister said.He also emphasised that steps must be taken to ensure that migrant labourers do not face any inconvenience and were motivated to stay back."The representatives must come forward to motivate the people to get themselves vaccinated. Old people and those with disabilities must be helped to reach vaccination centres, so that they could be vaccinated," Thakur added."Steps must be taken to keep a better vigil on industrial areas of the State so that the migrant labourers do not get infected. Regular sanitization must be carried out in the towns and municipalities and steps should be taken to ensure that not more than fifty people attend any social functions," he said further here in the statement.The Health Department should provide information regarding Covid-19 positive patients to the councilors so that they could contact the family members of the Covid-19 positive patients. He said that the councilors at their own level also must keep an eye on any covid-19 patient in their areas.Thakur said that as many as 250 deaths have been reported in last two months only.The state government has taken some stringent steps to check the spread of this virus."The government has imposed restrictions on visit of devotees to the major temple in the state and from today only Puja would be allowed in these temples.It has also announced that all the offices would remain close on Saturday and Sunday. Buses would ply with 50 per cent seat capacity and only 50 people have been permitted in all religious, social and other gatherings," Thakur said at the event.Various dignitaries including Mayor Municipal Corporation Dharamshala, Mandi, Solan Poonam, Shimla also present during the virtual meet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/himachal-cm-urges-elected-representatives-to-ensure-welfare-well-being-of-people-during-covid-19-pandemic-101619086136392.html
22-04-2021||India||Former Jammu and Kashmir minister dies of Covid-19||A former Jammu and Kashmir minister and veteran Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Thakur Puran Singh succumbed to Covid-19 on Thursday while being shifted to Chandigarh for treatment from Rajouri district, said a state official.Around 85 years in age, Puran Singh was unwell for quite some time and had recently returned from Haridwar after attending a religious congregation. He will be cremated as per the laid down Covid-19 standard operating procedures (SoPs), the officer added. “He was being taken to Chandigarh for treatment but died enroute,” he said. The official said that the leader’s body was brought to the Government Medical College Hospital, Rajouri, where further arrangements for cremation were being made as per the protocols.Singh was a resident of Kewal Badhal in Rajouri’s Kotranka subdivision and was considered a prominent Pahari leader of the region. The veteran leader joined the BJP in 2014. “He won as an independent and was a minister of state in the PDP-Congress government in 2002. In 2014, he joined the BJP and was a member of the state executive committee,” said Raina. Jammu and Kashmir was a state of the Indian union before August 5, 2019, when its special status under Article 370 was revoked by the parliament and it was divided into two union territories. Raina said the local people had lost a prominent Pahari leader, who always fought for their rights.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/former-jammu-and-kashmir-minister-dies-of-covid19-101619086670252.html
22-04-2021||India||'Please help!': Covid tragedy spills onto social media in India||These days, social media posts in India are no longer about cheeky photos, funny memes or political jokes. Instead, frantic calls to save lives are flooding Twitter and Instagram as the latest wave of coronavirus cases and deaths overwhelm the nation’s hospitals and crematoriums.On Bharath Pottekkat’s Instagram feed, one message screams “Mumbai please help! Lungs damaged due to pneumonia infection. In need of ICU bed.” Another reads “Plasma urgently required for treatment of Covid patient in Max Hospital, Delhi.” More follow. “Urgently needed Tocilizumab injection. Please DM if you know of stock in and around Mumbai.”New appeals land with every refresh. “My brain can’t handle the social media overload,” said Pottekkat, a 20-year-old Delhi law student. “I can’t process what I’m reading. I feel numb.”Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Telegram are all inundated with messages from distraught family members and friends begging for everything from hospital beds to medicines, CT scans, doorstep Covid tests, and even food for the elderly in quarantine.The desperate pleas, hoping someone will respond with a speedy remedy, offer a peek into the unfolding tragedy buffeting a country of 1.3 billion people that now has the world’s fastest-growing Covid-19 caseload. The messages also reveal the panic and disarray amid shortages of drugs, intensive-care beds and medical oxygen.Highlighting the grim situation, India on Thursday reported a record 2,104 new Covid-19 deaths, and an unprecedented 314,835 fresh cases — the world’s highest daily tally. Total infections of almost 16 million is the second-highest in the world. Despite being home to the world’s biggest vaccine maker, the country is struggling to provide enough shots. Large festivals and elections that led to mass gatherings, and lower vigilance around masks and social distancing have contributed to the resurgence.The surge has forced both India’s financial and political capitals — Mumbai and New Delhi — to impose restrictions on movement, with the latter mandating a six-day strict lockdown starting April 20. Maharashtra state, home to Mumbai, tightened curbs starting Thursday.Read more: Modi Under Fire for Campaigning as India Reels From Virus Deaths One particular Instagram post rattled Pottekkat. A woman at her mother’s bedside described an apocalyptic scene at a hospital in the northern city of Lucknow, where people got into a scuffle to lay their hands on a fresh batch of oxygen cylinders that just arrived. Separately, a hospital chain in New Delhi approached a court to help secure the critical gas.Barkha Dutt, a journalist, pointed out the shortage of crematoriums around the country, tweeting pictures of a cremation ground in Surat, a city in the western state of Gujarat.Nowhere is the desperation more evident than in the social media feed of Ranjan Pai, the billionaire owner and co-founder of Manipal Education & Medical Group, which runs the country’s second-largest hospital chain -- the TPG and Temasek-backed Manipal Health Enterprises Pvt. Pai is deluged with DMs from hundreds of people, mostly strangers, asking him for ICU beds, oxygen supply and Covid drugs. The 7,000 beds in his 27-hospital chain are full.“We were caught off-guard,” Pai said. “No country is equipped to handle a surge this fast and this severe.”In February, only 4% of Manipal’s beds were taken by coronavirus patients. A few weeks later, that number has climbed to 65%, the rest already occupied by emergency cardiac, oncology and other patients. Pai’s hospitals, doctors and administrators are stretched to the limit, he said.India’s stocks and the rupee have taken a hit on concern the latest surge and curbs will pummel the $2.9 trillion economy that was just recovering from a rare recession last year. The benchmark S&P BSE Sensex is down almost 8% from its Feb. 15 record, while the rupee is approaching an all-time low.Read Andy Mukherjee’s column: How a Covid Spike Sucked the Oxygen Out of India The collapse of the country’s decrepit public health system is evident in the gut-wrenching photos on social media of multiple Covid patients sharing a single hospital bed, a line of ambulances outside a hospital in Mumbai, and people dying as they wait for oxygen. Government helplines are broken. Thousands of social media forwards plead for the antiviral drug Remdesivir, and many more seek donor plasma.There’s however a bright side to this mayhem. Responders from students to technology professionals, non-profit organizations and even Bollywood actors like Sonu Sood are rallying to supply meals, circulate information on availability of hospital beds or Remdesivir. They’ve amplified voices of those in need of emergency help. Total strangers are volunteering to bring supplies and food to patients’ doorsteps.Those who put together crowd-sourced, authentic information on social media are today’s heroes in the current situation, said Vikas Chawla, co-founder of Chennai-headquartered digital agency, Social Beat.“It takes just a few people to step forward and make it happen,” Chawla said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/please-help-covid-tragedy-spills-onto-social-media-in-india-101619085959256.html
22-04-2021||India||Ensure no restriction in supply of oxygen for Covid-19 patients: MHA to states||The Centre on Thursday said there will be no restriction on the movement of medical oxygen and stressed that the supply cannot be limited to any particular state."No restrictions shall be imposed on oxygen manufacturers and suppliers to limit the oxygen supplies only to hospitals of the state or Union territory in which they are located," the order read.Earlier in the day, some hospitals in Delhi moved the high court, pleading the replenishment of oxygen so that they can continue providing care to coronavirus disease (Covid-19) patients.The order issued by the ministry of home affairs also instructed that no authority shall attach the oxygen-carrying vehicles passing through any district for making supplies specific to any particular district.The government also banned the supply of oxygen for industrial purposes till further orders are issued. "Supply of oxygen for industrial purposes, except those exempted by the government, is prohibited with effect from 22nd April, 2021, and till further orders," it said.The order highlighted that medical oxygen is an essential public health commodity and any impediment in its supplies has the potential to critically impact the management of patients suffering from coronavirus disease in other parts of the country.The order came soon after the Supreme Court took a suo motu cognisance of the present Covid-19 situation of the country, including oxygen and essential drugs supply, and asked the Centre to present a national plan on Covid-19 management.ALSO READ: Situation with medical oxygen in Delhi not comfortable, Satyendar Jain warnsThe Centre announced on Wednesday evening that it was increasing the quota of oxygen in eight states, including Delhi, in view of the sudden spike in demand due to an exponential rise in the number of Covid-19 patients admitted in hospitals.As India saw 314,835 new cases of the coronavirus disease and 2,104 fatalities in the last 24 hours, the highest spike in the world on a single day, the oxygen crisis precipitated by the second wave appeared to intensify with complaints of shortage from several states.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ensure-no-restriction-in-supply-of-oxygen-for-covid-19-patients-mha-to-states-101619085172813.html

SC agrees to hear plea||The Supreme Court on Thursday termed the Covid-19 situation as almost a "national emergency" while agreeing to hear Vedanta's plea for opening of its Sterlite copper unit at Tuticorin in Tamil Nadu on the ground that it would produce thousand tonnes of oxygen and give it free of cost to treat patients.A bench headed by Chief Justice SA Bobde was unimpressed with the objection of Tamil Nadu government which initially sought hearing of Vedanta's plea on Monday and opposed its opening on various grounds including that it has been rejected by the apex court earlier."We understand all this. We will ensure compliance of all environmental norms by the plant and its oxygen producing facility would be allowed to operate. We are on the oxygen plant," the bench, also comprising Justices L Nageswara Rao and S Ravindra Bhat, said when senior advocate C S Vaidyanathan for Tamil Nadu objected to the plea of the company."There is almost a national emergency and you (Tamil Nadu) don't put spokes in the solution. We will hear it (plea of Vedanta) tomorrow," the bench said in the hearing conducted through video conferencing."The country is in dire need of oxygen and the Centre is augmenting oxygen from whichever source. Vedanta wants to make its plant operational, but let Vedanta only make it operational to manufacture oxygen for health purposes," Solicitor General Tushar Mehta said.“Between protecting environment and protecting human life, we must lean in favour of protecting human life,” Mehta said.Senior advocate Harish Salve, appearing for Vedanta, sought urgent hearing of the plea during the day itself and said people are dying on daily basis and we can produce and supply oxygen to treat Covid patients."We can start in five to six days if you give a go ahead today. The company can manufacture tonnes of oxygen there everyday and is ready to supply them free of cost," Salve said.The Tamil Nadu government, however referred to the records and said no oxygen production can be started by the company before two to four weeks.The bench would hear the interim application on Friday.The copper unit was closed after a May 23, 2018 order by the Tamil Nadu pollution control board following violent protests against the unit which left 13 people dead in police firing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vedanta-seeks-to-reopen-tuticorin-unit-for-oxygen-output-sc-agrees-to-hear-plea-101619083876233.html

He added that the security forces operate within the legal framework with the single objective of protecting life and property of the native population.“It is the Maoist cadres who have taken away the lives of thousands of innocent civilians by using Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) and explosive materials. They haven’t spared even children, women and animals during their desperate attempts to harm the security forces using IEDs,” said Sunderaj P, the inspector general (IG) of Bastar range.Maoist leader Vikalp earlier released a press note and some photographs alleging a drone strike injured some animals in two villages. “The drone strike was conducted (by) security forces in Bottalanka and Palagudem villages. The strike shows the real face of the central and the state government,” the note said.However, the Bastar IG said it were the Maoists, who triggered an IED blast in Narayanpur on Wednesday, seriously injuring one Indo Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) officer and also killing a cow in the process.“The [Maoists] don’t have any moral authority to level such baseless allegations against the security forces. It is high time they stopped unleashing cruelty against innocent tribals of Bastar and let the native population lead a peaceful life,” Sunderaj said.Maoists have also abducted an assistant sub-inspector (ASI) of state police in Bastar region’s Bijapur district, officials said on Thursday.Earlier on March 31, they ambushed 22 security personnel and injured 31 others, during a combing operation along the Sukma-Bijapur border. They also abducted Rakeshwar Singh Manhas, a commando with the Central Reserve Police Force’s (CRPF) elite CoBRA force. He was released a few days later.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chhattisgarh-police-dismiss-maoists-claim-of-drone-strike-in-2-bastar-villages-101619083610020.html

An employee managing the tanker present at the spot and the hospital administration staff tried to stop the leakage.Later, the hospital administration called an engineer who rectified the malfunctioning and the leakage was stopped between 1.45 pm and 2 pm, the official said."The patients died due to disruption of the oxygen supply following leakage from the tank," he said.It happened because of "negligence and carelessness" on part of some people who were yet to be identified, he said.Accordingly, an FIR has been registered against unidentified persons, the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nashik-oxygen-tank-that-leaked-was-activated-just-3-weeks-ago-101619082582352.html

The government has permitted gatherings of up to 50 people. In this case there were 22-35 people. Nobody shook hands,” Tikait was quoted as saying by news agency ANI. He was speaking in response to a video of an Iftar party organised by farmers’ leaders doing rounds in social media.Speaking on the ongoing protests Tikait said that farmers are at their homes. “Farmers are pretty much at their home. Where will we ask them to go? Is Covid-19 spreading from here? We have been living here for the last five months and it is our home now.”Tikait further said that several farmers are struggling with getting the second dose of the vaccine. The leader added that vaccine officers were requested to camp at the protest sites. Haryana minister Anil Vij said that the government will consult farmer leaders for carrying out vaccinations and tests at protest sites. “Officers of the state health department will meet today (Thursday) with farmers protesting at Haryana borders regarding their testing and vaccination. The department will begin their work if the leaders agree.”Dr NK Arora, the chairman of National Technical Advisory Group of Immunisation (NTAGI), on April 14 said that mass agitations could transform into ‘super spreader’ events, highlighting that the farmers’ agitation should come to a halt. Several experts also attribute the sudden rise in cases to people letting their guard down after winter season when cases reduced and also to religious events and political events like elections.Farmers have been protesting for the last five months against the he Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance, and Farm Services Act, 2020, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020 and continue to stress that these laws will benefit private companies in the agricultural sector and adversely affect their incomes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bku-leader-tikait-wants-vaccine-centres-says-protest-sites-are-farmers-homes-101619080540314.html

This will also bleed the finances of state governments.”“In these unprecedented times, how can the Government of India permit such brazen profiteering from people’s misery? At a time when medical resources are scarce, hospital beds are unavailable, oxygen supply and availability of essential medicine is dwindling rapidly, why is your Government allowing a policy that reeks of such insensitivity,” she said.Earlier, the Congress had demanded the formula of “one nation, one price” for vaccines.“..how can the same vaccine manufactured by the same company have three different prices?” Gandhi questioned, claiming no rationale or justification in this “arbitrary distinction”.She alleged that the Union government has abdicated its responsibility to provide free vaccination for people in the age group of 18 to 45 years and “this is complete abandonment of the Government’s responsibility towards our youth.”She reiterated that the allocation to state governments should be “transparent and equitable, in line with the spirit of cooperative federalism.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sonia-writes-to-pm-seeks-uniform-price-for-covid-vaccines-101619078629406.html

The apex court will take up the matter for hearing again on Friday.Noting that at least six high courts are hearing matters pertaining to Covid-19 management, Chief Justice of India SA Bobde said this is creating some confusion and diversion. The CJI said the apex court wants to issue notice for a national plan which includes four issues: supply of oxygen, supply of essential drugs, the method and manner of vaccination and the power to declare lockdowns.‘Heavens won’t fall’: Court upbraids Centre on Delhi hospitals’ SOS for oxygen"We as a court wish to take suo motu cognisance of certain issues.

But it is creating confusion and diversion of resources," the CJI said.The development comes ahead of the Delhi high court's hearing of a case related to the oxygen supply in the hospitals of the Capital, scheduled at 3pm. Hearing a petition filed by Max Healthcare on Wednesday, the Delhi high court questioned why the Centre is not diverting oxygen from petroleum and steel industries for medical exigencies when corporates are doing that."We don't care, beg, borrow, steal or requisition new plants if you want," said the judges asking the Centre to ensure oxygen supply for Covid-19 treatment.Since February, the Covid-19 situation in the country has been worsening steadily. On Thursday, India recorded 3.14 lakh new infections, which is the highest daily rise recorded in any country.

He asked people to carry their Aadhaar card and prescription where they have been suggested this anti-viral drug.Those who allowed Remdesivir to be black marketed at more than 30 thousand a vial & hospital beds to be sold for 5-10 Lakh in Delhi are concerned that a few hundred Fabiflu strips are being given for FREE to the poor.

Saying that there is no merit in the plea, Justice Navin Chawla refused to pass any order stopping the investigation.Justice Navin Chawla said that though it would have been "prudent" for the CCI to wait for the outcome of the petitions against the privacy policy in the Supreme Court and the Delhi high court but not doing so would not make its investigation order "perverse" or "wanting of jurisdiction".The CCI on March 24 ordered a probe into the new privacy policy of Whatsapp, which has to be completed within two months. Both Facebook and WhatsApp challenged the order and in their separate pleas, filed through advocate Tejas Karia, contended that since the issue of WhatsApp’s privacy policy was before the Supreme Court, the CCI did not need to order the probe.CCI contended that social media intermediary WhatsApp’s new privacy policy would lead to excessive data collection and “stalking” of consumers for targeted advertising to bring in more users. In January, after facing flak for its new update which requires users to agree to share their business account data with Facebook, WhatsApp postponed the rollout of the policy from February 8 to May 15. CCI took a suo moto cognisance of the matter and ordered a thorough and detailed investigation to ascertain "the full extent, scope and impact of data sharing through involuntary consent of users"."...the Commission is of prima facie opinion that the 'take-it-or-leave-it' nature of privacy policy and terms of service of WhatsApp and the information sharing stipulations mentioned therein, merit a detailed investigation in view of the market position and market power enjoyed by WhatsApp," CCI's order said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/investigation-into-whatsapp-s-new-privacy-policy-won-t-stop-rules-delhi-hc-101619069175322.html
22-04-2021||India||Safeguards must against power of provisional attachment under GST laws: SC||The Supreme Court has called the power to order provisional attachment of properties under the Goods and Services Tax (GST) law “draconian in nature”, stressing that such orders cannot be left to the “unguided subjective discretion” of the authorities. A bench of justices Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud and MR Shah emphasised that every order of provisional attachment must comply with the procedural safeguards and requirement laid down under the GST law concerned. “The power to order a provisional attachment of the property of the taxable person including a bank account is draconian in nature and the conditions which are prescribed by the statute for a valid exercise of the power must be strictly fulfilled,” said the bench in its verdict on Tuesday. It pointed out that the consequence of a provisional attachment is serious since it displaces the person whose property is attached from dealing with the property, and where a bank account is attached, it prevents the person from operating the account. Therefore, the court said, before passing an order of provisional attachment, it is necessary to adhere to the twin conditions: first, allowing the assessee to submit objections to the order of attachment on the ground that the property was or is not liable for attachment and second, give him opportunity to be heard before the order. According to the bench, the dual procedural safeguards demand strict compliance and an order cannot be passed by simply stating that attachment is necessary for the purpose of protecting the interest of the government revenue without showing a proximate and live nexus to achieving this objective. The bench was dealing with an appeal by M/s Radha Krishna Industries against the Himachal Pradesh high court’s order of January 1, 2021 dismissing its writ petition against provisional attachment of its properties under the Himachal Pradesh Goods and Service Tax Act, 2017 for tax liability of ₹5.03 crore. Senior advocate Puneet Bali, appearing for the petitioner, had complained that his client was not given any opportunity of being heard before the coercive order and that the authorities invoked this power without giving substantial reasons. The top court accepted Bali’s plea while noting that there were similar provisions in statutes passed by different state governments and hence, it was required to be clarified that any order of provisional attachment must comply with both substantive and procedural, embodied in the statute and the rules because the anticipatory attachment is contemplated pending a final demand or liability. “The exercise of unguided discretion cannot be permissible because it will leave citizens and their legitimate business activities to the peril of arbitrary power. Each of these ingredients must be strictly applied before a provisional attachment on the property of an assesses can be levied,” it held. The court maintained that the commissioner should pass such orders only when a provisional attachment is necessary for the purpose of protecting the interest of the government revenue and there were cogent and speaking reasons to do so. In the present case, the bench set aside the order of provisional attachment after holding it violative of the statutory provisions and procedural safeguards. After the pronouncement of the judgment, justice Chandrachud told Bali: “We hope and expect that our judgment guides GST authorities in all states in these matters.” Commenting on the verdict, advocate Ayush Jindal told HT: “By entering into an interpretative journey of unravelling the substantive and procedural content of the power of provisional attachment, the Supreme Court shuns the current practice of extortion by the department while applying the draconian provisions under the Act.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/safeguards-must-against-power-of-provisional-attachment-under-gst-laws-sc-101619067888872.html

Take 6-minute walk test, says doctor||As hospitals are running out of beds with a sharp spike in the number of people Covid-19 patients requiring medical admission, doctors are urging people to not panic if the RT-PCR test comes positive and not to seek hospital admission when not required. Most of the Covid-19 positive patients get cured under home treatment, a video message posted by the citizen engagement platform of the government of India said based on the suggestions of Dr CS Pramesh, director, Tata Memorial Hospital.Apart from good nutrition, loads of fluid, yoga, pranayam, covid-positive patients must track their fever and oxygen level. For an accurate understanding of the oxygen level, taking a six-minute walk test is being suggested where a patient has to oxygen reading before and after six-minute of walking in their isolation rooms. This test can be taken 2-3 times in a day, the video message said. If these readings are normal, then there is no need for the hospital admission.Watch this video to know when one should seek admission in a hospital when found COVID-19 positive. #IndiaFightsCorona @MoHFW_INDIA @PMOIndia @PIB_India @MIB_India @drharshvardhan @cspramesh (2/2) pic.twitter.com/aodHAC34LAHospital admission is needed if> the baseline saturation on Oximeter is below 94 per cent> there is a 4 per cent or more fluctuation in oxygen level before and after 6 minutes of walkingIn such cases when the oxygen level is below 94 per cent, one should lie face down on their belly to improve the oxygen level in blood.Regarding medication, if a patient does not have any other symptom than fever, then only paracetamol is required.AIIMS director Dr Ramdeep Guleria has said more than 85 per cent of the covid patients will recover without any specific treatment. "Oxygen is a treatment, it is like a drug. There is no data that shows that this will be of any help to the patients and is, therefore, ill-advised," he said adding that healthy individuals with oxygen saturation in the range of 93-94 per cent do not need to take high-flow oxygen to maintain the optimum saturation level.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/when-a-covid-19-patient-seek-hospital-admission-take-6-minute-walk-test-says-doctor-101619057006376.html

22-04-2021||India||World’s worst outbreak||With 315,909 new cases of Covid-19 in India on Wednesday, the country broke not only all its previous daily records, but also earned the grim distinction of reporting the most single-day infections in any country ever.After Wednesday’s tally, the seven-day average of new cases in the country now stands at 264,838 a day – higher even than America’s third wave, which peaked at 255,961 cases a day for the week ending January 11. This means that India is not only the largest outbreak in the world right now, but also the largest outbreak ever recorded in the world.A total of 2,102 people lost their lives to the viral disease across India on Wednesday, also the single-day record for the country, as the relentless expansion of the outbreak under the second wave continued to spark shortages of hospital beds and other crucial supplies such as oxygen and medicines.Till Wednesday, 15,924,697 confirmed Covid-19 infections and 184,693 deaths have now been reported across the country, according to HT’s dashboard.The previous record for most cases in a single day anywhere in the world was set when the US, which is the world’s worst-hit country with 32.5 million cases and 582,000 deaths, reported 307,581 new cases on January 8, 2021, according to global case data tallied by worldometers.info.The most worrying factor right now remains how fast daily cases are continuing to grow, and how the trajectory is exhibiting no clear signs of approaching a peak still.The country’s daily case tally crossed the 100,000 mark for the first time on April 6 when 115,320 new infections were reported. It just took another nine days for the daily case tally to breach the 200,000 mark for the first time (there were 216,913 new cases on April 15). From there, it took only six days to cross the 300,000 mark.The daily case trajectory has now grown 62% in the last week. If this rate of case increase continues, then the country is on the pace to be reporting an average of half a million cases every day in as little as 10 days, shows data.The average positivity rate – the proportion of tests that return positive for Covid-19 – has now soared to 17% in the past week, the highest ever recorded in the country. This number, which is a crucial statistic that shows how prevalent the virus is in society, is rising still – on Tuesday (the latest data for which national testing numbers are available) 18% of tests came back positive.The trend is similar in most of the country – weekly average positivity rate is rising in all of India’s 20 most populous states, despite the testing rate being the highest ever maintained. On average, 1.5 million samples have been tested every day in the country, the highest ever.In Chhattisgarh, which reported 14,519 cases and 193 deaths on Wednesday, nearly one out of every three tests (29.8%) has come back positive in the past week – the highest in the country — and has gone up 2.8 percentage points from the week before. Delhi (24,638 cases and 249 deaths on Wednesday) has seen the biggest increase in average positivity rate in the past seven days – it went from 11% on April 14 to 26.3% in the last week. In Maharashtra, the country’s worst-hit state with 67,468 cases and 568 deaths on Wednesday, on average a quarter (24.9%) of tests have come back positive. It is similar in Madhya Pradesh, where 23.1% of all tests have come back positive (up 7 percentage points in the last week). In Andhra Pradesh, average positivity rate has risen 8.9 percentage points (from 10.2% to 19.1%), while in West Bengal and Haryana it has gone up over 7 percentage points (from 11.1% to 18.1%, and from 10.8% to 18.5%, respectively) in the past week.The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that the average positivity of an area should ideally remain below 5% if the region is testing adequately.“Of the 740 districts in the country, the Covid-19 positivity rate is more than 15% in 146 districts. These regions are a cause for concern for both the Union government as well the respective state governments as the local health care system is facing the strain of rising cases. We have held detailed discussions with the local governments to narrow down on a strategy to ... stop the chain of transmission there,” said Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan during the health ministry’s weekly Covid-19 press briefing on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/worlds-worst-outbreak-101619041796105.html

22-04-2021||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||For weeks, Hindustan Times has, every time it has managed to lay its hands on it (data is as difficult to find as oil), published the status of vaccine distribution across states. This is managed by the Union government, and, I must confess, I cannot understand the basis on which vaccines are distributed.It is clearly not population. Uttar Pradesh, the most populous state in the country, received just about the same amount of vaccines as Rajasthan (till the evening of April 18), and just around 500,000 more doses than Gujarat, states with roughly a third of its population.Bihar, with a population that is approximately 1.7 times Rajasthan and Gujarat’s (separately) received just around half the number of vaccines they did.The generous allocations to the two western states also indicates that it is likely not active cases that is the criteria. According to the government’s own data from last week, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka, Chhattisgarh, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu are the states with the most active cases — in that order. Yet Chhattisgarh, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu have all received fewer vaccines than Bihar, which, if the data is to be believed, has won the fight against Covid-19. They have also received much fewer vaccines than Madhya Pradesh.The government’s note on the Phase 3 of its vaccine drive hints at a definite methodology — “on the criteria of extent of infection (number of active Covid cases) and performance (speed of administration)” and warns that “wastage” will “affect the criteria” — but stops short of spelling it out.I am sure there is a transparent and dynamic methodology, based on objective criteria on the allocation of vaccines — it’s just that we don’t know what it is.Reports over the past few days have suggested a similar issue with the allocation of medical oxygen. The Delhi government has complained that oxygen meant for it is being diverted to Uttar Pradesh. Now Tamil Nadu has joined the chorus, saying oxygen meant for it was diverted to some other southern states. Again, I’m sure there is a transparent and dynamic methodology that is the basis for this allocation — and again, it’s just that we don’t know what it is.It’s important to publicise these methodologies. People may disagree with them, but debate and discussion can only make them better. It’s even more important to do so because half the vaccines made in India (the policy is silent on the imports on this front) will have to be supplied to the Central Drugs Laboratory from May 1, when the country enters Phase 3 of its vaccine drive. The Union government will then distribute these to the states — and because Phase 3 is certain to be messy, at least in the initial weeks, may be even months, it makes sense to share details of the basis on which this will be done. Assuming the two local manufacturers of vaccines manage to increase their capacities to the levels they want to by June, this means the Union government will have between 50 million and 60 million doses to share with the states. In addition, the states, depending on their ability (and capacity) to strike deals with vaccine makers, will have access to another 50 to 60 million doses of these two vaccines.There is still some confusion on Bharat Biotech’s exact capacity, but there’s congruence between the two latest statements, one from the Department of Science and Technology, and another from the company itself, putting the number at 60-70 million doses a month by July-August and 700 million doses a year, respectively. DST’s statement also speaks of a more ambitious 100 million doses a month capacity by September. So, at least from August, there will be more vaccines available (although the 50% share for states and the open market could reduce some more because of contractual export commitments that both Bharat Biotech and Serum Institute of India have).Then there are the imports — Dr Reddy’s has said its first imports of the Sputnik V vaccine will land in May, but has steered clear of putting a number to this. Local manufacturing of Sputnik V should have started by now, but not too many details of this have been forthcoming (either from the companies or the government) adding to the asymmetry of information on the availability of vaccines.It’s important to fill these data gaps — a congruent, fair, vaccine policy is impossible without doing so.Everyone should have themselves vaccinated but not everyone will. The government, last-mile public health workers, the media, non-governmental organisations, and educational institutions, should all work to break this reluctance, which, at least in the next several months when supplies lag, will actually work to India’s advantage. But eventually, everyone should get vaccinated; no one is safe till everyone is. The government can also help by addressing all concerns regarding vaccines (its response to the Brazilian drug regulator’s criticism of Bharat Biotech’s manufacturing practices has been inadequate) and by being transparent about adverse effects, including deaths. It’s move, on Wednesday, to release data that showed that just 0.02% people who received one dose of the Covishield vaccine, and 0.03% of those that received both doses subsequently tested positive for Covid-19, is just the kind of reassurance India needs. The numbers are an equally reassuring 0.04% and 0.04% in the case of Covaxin.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19what-you-need-to-know-today-101619039156466.html
22-04-2021||India||Lack of trucks, road blockades hinder supply of oxygen||A lack of cryogenic trucks, interstate road blockades, and troubles faced by staff in reaching factories are making the shortage of medical oxygen worse, officials and company representatives said, detailing a wide variety of factors that has now brought the state governments of Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and Haryana into a confrontation even as the Capital’s hospitals struggle to treat patients.Suppliers, district officials, and police personnel have been scrambling to ease some of these bottlenecks; even as higher authorities accused counterparts in other states of deliberately holding up supplies and putting lives at risk.“The Delhi government made frantic calls to at least a dozen transporters having cryogenic tankers and other such vehicles, but found little luck,” according to a person aware of the crisis, who asked not to be named.Several hospitals and at least six transporters HT spoke to on Wednesday, too, said there was a major scramble for tankers in the Capital for transportation of oxygen. At least one transporter and one hospital said vehicles were intercepted and supplies disrupted.“Yes, we did get a call from the Delhi government 3-4 days ago. But, by then Madhya Pradesh had already booked all our cryogenic tankers and they are operating in that state. The MP administration had intercepted our tankers that had left from Faridabad when it was on its way to be filled at Rourkela. Since then, it is with them and they are making the payments timely,” said KK Yadav, a transporter in Faridabad.Max Healthcare Institute on Wednesday wrote to health minister Satyendar Jain saying the tanker scheduled to arrive at its facility in Shalimar Bagh was diverted to the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS).“Yesterday night, the oxygen supply to the hospital was disrupted as an oxygen tanker from M/s Inox on its way to refill the oxygen tanks at Max hospital, Shalimar Bagh was diverted to AIIMS. This led to a situation where the hospital’s oxygen tanks ran dry. Thus, we had a critical situation at the hospital and had to manage the patients on oxygen cylinders... This seriously jeopardised the safety of the 250 Covid patients admitted under our care and can lead to a very serious situation,” read the letter written by the health care firm.The crisis came into focus after one key hospital, GTB, received replenishments with mere minutes to spare on Tuesday night, and a similar crisis was averted at the last minute on Wednesday when vehicles from a Haryana-based company were let through to bring much-needed refills to four Delhi hospitals.Officials at Inox Air Product limited, which supplies around 20% of the city’s oxygen requirement, said its trucks were taking 2-3 hours extra because of diversions owing to farmers’ protest at Ghazipur and Singhu borders.“Our tankers, particularly those coming from Uttar Pradesh, are having to travel 10-15 kilometres extra to enter Delhi due to closure of the Ghazipur border. This may not be much for a car, but for heavy vehicles like ours, it can cause a delay of several hours due to speed and traffic constraints,” said an official of the company, asking not to be named.Linde India Limited, another oxygen supplier to Delhi, said the company is optimising its production and supply according to the demand. “The delivery of medical oxygen from our Faridabad plant to hospitals outside Haryana was disrupted for about 4-5 hours on April 21, 2021 around midday, as a result of certain restrictions from the local government officials. The issue has since been resolved and delivery of medical oxygen to the affected hospitals has resumed,” it said in a statement.Delhi Police officers said that movement of oxygen tankers was hindered due to the blockade of the routes, but there were no complaints of any attempts by farmer groups to disallow the tankers.On Wednesday morning, Delhi Police escorted an oxygen tanker stranded at the Kundli Border, near Singhu. “The tanker was meant for Jaipur Golden Hospital in Delhi. We coordinated with Kundli Police to establish a green corridor to escort the tanker to Delhi in the next few minutes,” said Rajiv Ranjan, deputy commissioner of police (outer-north).Siddharth Rastogi, executive director (sales) of MVS Engineering Pvt. Ltd, a manufacturer of medical oxygen production systems, said the company is also having to provide shelter to half its staff at its manufacturing plant in Okhla Industrial Area because the rest of the workers have not yet received their e-passes from Delhi’s district administrations.“The problem we are experiencing in big cities is that because of this massive demand for oxygen, cities like Delhi are consuming oxygen at a rate of three times their usual consumption. This means that the demand-supply is skewed massively. Furthermore, the deliveries are getting affected due to many staffers of the oxygen supply companies getting affected by Covid,” said Rastogi.Rastogi also said: “In many oxygen manufacturing companies that are doing bulk supply as liquid oxygen or in cylinders, there are cases where they also don’t have drivers to deliver”.(With inputs from Shiv Sunny)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lack-of-trucks-road-blockades-hinder-supply-of-oxygen-101619038361495.html
22-04-2021||India||Quota of oxygen raised but shortfall persists||The Union government on Wednesday increased Delhi’s quota of medical oxygen from 378MT to 480MT per day, even as deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia urged the Centre to ensure that allocated quantities reach the Capital on time after several trucks were held up in Haryana and Uttar Pradesh.The move to increase Delhi’s quota came after the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government sought at least 700MT per day in order to meet demand in hospitals that has surged due to a flood of Covid-19 patients.“Central government has increased Delhi’s quota of oxygen. We are very grateful to the Centre for this,” chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said in a tweet. An official of the government, who asked not to be named, later said this capacity was enhanced to 480MT a day.“There will be still a shortfall of 220MT per day which we will have to make up for by ensuring proper demand-side management and plugging oxygen consumption wastage. In times of utmost crisis oxygen is diverted from low-demand hospitals to high-demand ones, but that is supposed to be the last resort,” this person added.According to the updated allocation schedule, oxygen will be supplied by at least five vendors from plants in Kalinga Nagar, Panipat, Rourkela, Roorkee, West Bengal, Bhiwadi, Barotiwala, Ghaziabad, Surajpur, Kashipur, Modinagar and Selakui.Earlier, Sisodia held a press conference and urged the centre to intervene, in particular citing incidents that took place on Tuesday night and Wednesday afternoon when supply trucks were held up in Uttar Pradesh’s Modinagar and Haryana’s Faridabad.“Today, an official in Faridabad stopped some trucks from leaving for hospitals in Delhi and other regions. After interventions, these vehicles were allowed to go. Similar problem happened last night, when we had to seek the intervention of a senior Union minister to get trucks freed from a plant near Modinagar. If we have to chase every single truck and ask Centre to intervene, then it’s not a good situation,” Sisodia said, saying the crisis should not turn into “a fight between states”.Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan indicated the government had intervened, saying during the weekly press briefing of the central government on Wednesday: “When you deal with such a huge challenge, at times there is panic and confusion. The onus and responsibility is on the Union and state governments to work together and respond quickly,” he said.Sisodia said hospitals in Delhi are facing a major shortage for the past 4-5 days now with the demand going up significantly and states not allowing supplies from units in their jurisdictions.The Haryana government denied allegations that it was not allowing vendors to supply oxygen to other states and refuted Sisodia’s statements. ‘’No supply has been stopped to Delhi, this is not true,’’ Haryana’s chief secretary said.Faridabad deputy commissioner Garima Mittal, who was named by some hospitals for having impeded the supplies, denied the allegations. Officials in UP did not respond to requests for comment, but an official claimed that no trucks were halted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/quota-of-oxygen-raised-but-shortfall-persists-101619038151171.html

22-04-2021||India||Bengal sets aside ₹100 crore for universal vaccination, to begin from May 5||The West Bengal government has set aside ₹100 crore for universal vaccination scheduled to take off on May 5, soon after the election results are declared, chief minister Mamata Banerjee said on Wednesday. Banerjee also said that she would write to Prime Minister Narendra Modi over vaccination pricing. “We have allocated ₹100 crore, which could be used to immediately purchase vaccines for the universal vaccination program. Till date we have administered 93 lakh doses. We will also urge the Centre to immediately supply us with another one crore doses. Then we can go for purchasing from the market,” she said. The chief minister said that the universal vaccination program would take off from May 5. Assembly elections are going on in West Bengal and counting is scheduled on May 2. “Vaccines, which were sold to the Centre for ₹150, will now be sold to states for ₹400 to private hospitals for ₹600. There should not be any discrimination. In times of an emergency do you help people or do business? For this the Centre should also take a decision without leaving it entirely on the people,” Banerjee said while adding that she would write to the Prime Minister. On Monday, the Centre had opened the Covid-19 vaccination for everyone above the age of 18. There are more than 7.34 crore registered voters in West Bengal (persons who are more than 18 years and above). The Serum Institute of India released the prices of Covishield vaccines on Wednesday and had said in a media statement that considering the global vaccine prices, “We are ensuring that our vaccines are affordable in comparison to any other vaccines in the world.” “Some people are testing positive even after taking two doses of vaccines. The infection is however mild in such cases. At least 1.1% people who have received both the vaccine doses have tested positive in Kolkata,” said Banerjee. With beds running out the state administration has directed government and private hospitals not to block any beds with patients whose condition is not critical. Also, hospitals have been directed to coordinate among themselves so that a critically ill patient could be referred to another hospital in case one hospital has no vacancy. Patients have been divided into three categories – A, B and C with A-category being the most critical patients who needs immediate hospitalization. “There is a shortage of oxygen. We are keeping a close watch on the market so that there is no black marketing and hoarding,” she said. Banerjee, however, ruled out the possibility of another lockdown in the immediate future saying that it affects people adversely. “I am not thinking about lockdown. People were badly hit by lockdown last year. I would urge everyone to stay alert and wear masks. But I won’t tell people to stop work and stay at home. I don’t think there is any immediate need of another lockdown,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-sets-aside-rs-100-crore-for-universal-vaccination-to-begin-from-may-5-101619035305224.html
22-04-2021||India||Kerala enforces more curbs as Covid-19 cases rise alarmingly, clamps night curfew||With Covid-19 cases soaring alarmingly the Kerala government on Wednesday decided to impose strict restrictions over the weekend and clamped night curfew for two weeks to contain the surge. The state recorded the highest single day tally on Wednesday with 22,414 cases clocking a high test positivity rate of 18.41 per cent.Talking to the media, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, who attended office after two weeks, said the second wave was really serious and the government will do everything possible to save lives. He said the state has enough stock of oxygen, ICU beds and ventilators but vaccine shortage was acute.“We did exceptionally well during the first wave and contained the mortality rate effectively (it is still below 0.4), we will overcome the second wave also,” he said. Earlier in the day he chaired a high-level meeting in the state capital to review the situation. During the weekend, only emergency services will be allowed and private firms have been asked to implement work from home on an urgent basis, he said.This is the first time the state has crossed 20,000 daily cases. With 22 fatalities, the death toll also went up to 5,000. Ernakulam district topped the list with 3980 cases. Active cases in the state rose to 1,35, 631, the CM said.In view of the mounting cases the state has also updated its quarantine and isolation guidelines. Once tested positive a doctor’s recommendation is necessary for the patient for hospitalization and this will ease pressure and lessen crowd in hospitals. Even after discharge from the hospital the patient will have to avoid travel and interaction with others at least for a week.Civic bodies have also begun virus control measures after a brief lull. Police have also raised fines for offenders. Similarly tuition classes are not permitted till further notice and local bodies will have to ensure that people don’t crowd vaccination centres.The CM said vaccine shortage was acute in the state and he has written a letter to the Prime Minister in this connection. He also criticised the Union government’s new vaccination policy and requested the PM ensure free supply. But the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has accused the CM of creating panic by repeatedly highlighting shortage of doses.BJP state president K Surendran said the CM’s letter was unnecessary and ill-timed after the Centre assured enough supply to the state in a couple of days. He said panic created by the government has led to fights at some vaccination centres. In Kottayam and Alappuzha people have clashed with health officials and others over delay.Surendran said the CM had promised last December that the LDF government will distribute vaccine to the people free of cost and it will also try to set up a vaccine production facility in the state. “It is not proper for the CM to make such false promises. In the last two months vaccine distribution was under control. It is wrong on the part of the state government to blame the Centre for the shoddy supply arrangement,” he said adding the CM was unnecessarily blaming the Union government.Minister of state for external affairs V Muraleedharan has also criticised the state government. “It is not proper for rulers to create panic. Instead of creating panic the government should have intervened to dispel unnecessary fear. The state will be getting 6.5 lakh doses in a couple of days,” he said. He said many recipients of the vaccine were not even registered and their influx created a shortage.But the ruling CPI (M) ridiculed the minister. “It is his habit to criticise the state government for everything. He has again challenged people of the state,” said party secretary A Vijayaraghavan. Earlier in the letter the CM highlighted the additional financial burden faced by the state due to the pandemic and noted that it was imperative to provide vaccine free of cost and he questioned the move to procure it from the market.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-enforces-more-curbs-as-covid-19-cases-rise-alarmingly-clamps-night-curfew-101619034527475.html
22-04-2021||India||Covaxin phase 3 interim trial reveals 78% efficacy||The second interim Phase 3 analysis of the first make-in-India Coronavirus disease (Covid-19) vaccine, Covaxin, has shown 78% efficacy, its maker Bharat Biotech announced on Wednesday.The company first released its preliminary Phase 3 analysis results in March, showing 81% efficacy based on 43 cases. In this round, a vaccine efficacy of 78% was recorded against mild, moderate, and severe symptoms of Covid-19 based on 127 cases.The efficacy against asymptomatic Covid-19 infections was 70%, suggesting decreased transmission in Covaxin recipients, the analysis showed. The efficacy against severe Covid-19 disease was 100%, along with a reduction in the number of hospitalisations. “[The vaccine’s] efficacy against Sars-CoV-2 has been established. Covaxin has demonstrated an excellent safety record in human clinical trials and in emergency-use... The efficacy data against severe Covid-19 and asymptomatic infections is highly significant, as this helps reduce hospitalisations and disease transmission, respectively,” said Krishna Ella, chairman and managing editor, Bharat Biotech.“The tireless efforts of our scientists at ICMR and BBIL have resulted in a truly effective international vaccine of the highest standards and efficacy. I am also happy to note that Covaxin works well against most variants of Sars-CoV-2. These findings together consolidate the position of our indigenous vaccine in the global vaccine landscape,” said Dr Balram Bhargava, director general, Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).Bharat Biotech has co-developed Covaxin with ICMR.ICMR said: “Covaxin neutralises against multiple variants of Sars-Cov-2, and effectively neutralises the double mutant strain as well.” Safety and efficacy results from the final analysis will be available in June, and the final report will be submitted to a peer-reviewed publication. Based on the achievement of the success criteria, placebo recipients have now become eligible to receive two doses of the vaccine.A total of 25,800 participants, between the ages of 18 and 98 (including 10% over the age of 60), were enrolled in the Phase 3 study. The analysis was conducted 14 days after the second dose. Covaxin was developed with seed strains received from the National Institute of Virology, and the Phase 3 clinical trial was co-funded by ICMR, making it a public-private partnership effort towards public health.“Covaxin’s evidence-based development has proved its suitability for global access, with excellent efficacy results against symptomatic, asymptomatic, and severe disease. The interest from countries worldwide has quietly validated our efforts,” said Suchitra Ella, joint managing director, Bharat Biotech.“For a respiratory vaccine, 78% efficacy is good,” Dr GC Khilnani, former head, pulmonology department, AIIMS, Delhi, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covaxin-phase-3-interim-trial-reveals-78-efficacy-101619033123671.html
22-04-2021||India||CoWin app set for revamp as pvt hospitals, states allowed to buy vaccines||The CoWIN mobile application is set for a revamp as the government allows private hospitals and state governments to directly procure vaccines, and makes people above the age of 18 eligible for the jab, officials familiar with the matter said, asserting that certificates will continue to be issued by the central government to ensure that a database is maintained.“A consolidated database of how many people have so far been vaccinated has to be maintained,” said an official familiar with the matter. “The central government will be the only authority issuing the vaccination certificates.”According to government data, so far, 60,599 government vaccination sites and 6,549 private vaccination sites are integrated with the CoWIN app. Once the new system is rolled out, more hospitals will be integrated with the application system to provide citizens easy access to availability of vaccines. “The government is also trying to provide data with reference to availability of remdesivir and oxygen on the application. The number of vaccination sites is expected to rise with the change in policy.”A second person said that switching the age of registration from 45 to 18 would be easy in a technical sense, but the more onerous task would be integrating the APIs (application programming interface) of CoWIN with the hospitals. “A hospital can choose whether to use the CoWIN app for registration or have a separate process, the idea is to ensure that a majority is onboarded to maintain a central database,” the second official said on condition of anonymity.The official added that in case the hospital does not wish to integrate with the registration process, it will have to integrate APIs at the certificate level.As far as registrations are concerned, the application can tackle the user load as it is scalable, the first official said. On Wednesday, 1,057,349 people registered for vaccination on the application. The app also provides the option of taking the second dose in a different state, city, in case a person is travelling.Once the integration is complete, prices of the vaccines, which can also be decided by the makers according to the new policy, will also be made available on the mobile application, along with the slots.Serum Institute of India on Wednesday fixed the price of Covishield vaccine at ₹400 for government hospitals and ₹600 for private hospitals. “The ultimate bottleneck will be availability of vaccines,” the second official said. “The makers are working to scale up availability, and there should be a clearer estimate available within the week.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cowin-app-set-for-revamp-as-pvt-hospitals-states-allowed-to-buy-vaccines-101619032724258.html

22-04-2021||India||4 more states to give free vaccines to all adults||Four states announced on Wednesday that they will provide vaccines to all people between 18 and 45 free of cost, potentially boosting the country’s inoculation drive that will open to all adults from May 1 amid a devastating surge in coronavirus infections.Chhattisgarh, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh and Kerala said they will bear the costs of vaccination for all adults. On Tuesday, Uttar Pradesh and Assam had decided to administer the vaccine without charge. At present, every person above the age of 45 years is eligible for a vaccine shot. It is free at government facilities and costs ₹250 per dose at private centres. On Monday, the central government had opened up the vaccination drive to all adults and said that state governments could procure shots directly from manufacturers, who could give 50% of jabs to private hospitals and states.Chhattisgarh chief minister Bhupesh Baghel said the expenses to vaccinate everyone above 18 will be borne by the state government and urged the Centre to ensure availability of adequate number of vaccines.“We will take all possible steps to protect our citizens’ lives. Request central government to ensure availability of adequate number of vaccines,” the chief minister posted on Twitter.Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan announced the vaccine would be offered to all adults free of cost.“A detailed guidelines of the government of India will be issued later, but the people above the age of 18 will be vaccinated for free in Madhya Pradesh,” he told reporters in Bhopal. Bihar followed suit. “The state government will provide free vaccination to 18 years and above people,” chief minister Nitish Kumar tweeted. Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan said: “Vaccines will be provided free of cost for everyone in Kerala. We had announced free vaccines in the state.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/4-more-states-to-give-free-vaccines-to-all-adults-101619032271791.html
22-04-2021||India||‘Watch next few days’: Sitharaman’s advice to India INC||Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Wednesday lauded the industry for its forbearance amid the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic but asked them to wait and watch for the next few days to correctly assess the situation even as the government takes policy measures to protect both lives and livelihoods.“I would request the industry to watch the next few days a bit more carefully, and then assess for yourself what this quarter is going to be like,” she said while addressing the national executive committee members of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Ficci) virtually.She assured the industry that the government is determined to contain the pandemic with a five-fold strategy — test, track, treat, Covid-19 protocols and vaccination. The government, along with the industry, will assess the situation and take appropriate measures to sustain the growth momentum, she said.The raging second wave of Covid-19 infections in India is threatening to derail the gradual recovery the economy achieved in the last one year, according to the trajectory of the Nomura India Business Resumption Index (NIBRI). Experts believe that the worst is yet to come as more states resort to restrictions to prevent the surge in infections from overwhelming medical infrastructure.A 68-day nationwide lockdown from March 25 last year led to a 24.4% contraction of the economy in the first quarter of 2020-21. The economy shrank by 7.3% in the second quarter, before expanding by 0.4% in the three months ended December 31. Overall, the economy is expected to contract by 8% in 2020-21.Addressing another virtual gathering of over 150 businessmen at the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), Sitharaman emphasised the need is to adopt micro containment strategy in dealing with the second surge of the pandemic as the country has important tools such as vaccines and medicines.She assured seamless supply of oxygen to states through measures such as round-the-clock working of the oxygen filling stations, allowing containers for nitrogen and argon to be used for oxygen and import of medical oxygen. She was replying to CII president Uday Kotak’s suggestions to ramp up vaccination and ensure adequate supplies of oxygen, medicines and beds to contain the spread of pandemic.Speaking at Ficci, Sitharaman said the supply of oxygen has been very neatly mapped and new permissions have been given particularly for the hard stressed 12 states — Delhi, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Punjab, Haryana, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Kerala. “The government has exempted all inter-state movement of oxygen tankers, exempted from registration and permits, they can operate round the clock, and cylinder filling plants are operating 24 hours to fill the gaps with necessary safeguards,” she said.Sitharaman said the government initiatives would help to ramp up capacity of producing remdesivir, a vital anti-viral drug, from 3.6 million vials per month to 7.8 million vials per month. The government on Tuesday allowed duty-free import of the drug and its raw materials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/watch-next-few-days-sitharaman-s-advice-to-india-inc-101619032365376.html
22-04-2021||India||Japan PM calls off visit to India, Philippines due to critical covid situation||Japan Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga has cancelled a planned visit to India and the Philippines later this month because of the Covid-19 situation, people familiar with the developments said on Wednesday.A 2+2 meeting of the defence and foreign ministers of India and Japan, which was to be held in Tokyo later this week, has also been called off, the people said on condition of anonymity.Though both countries were keen on the visit going ahead, a decision was made to call off the trip following consultations on Tuesday because of the Covid-19 situation on both sides, the people said. India recorded about 295,000 new infections on Tuesday – the biggest daily increase reported in any country – while Japan is grappling with a resurgence of infections.Neither India nor Japan had formally announced the visit, but Suga was expected to travel to New Delhi in late April or early May to boost bilateral cooperation, especially in the Indo-Pacific, in the face of China’s growing aggression and assertiveness across the region.The visit would have set the stage for the first in-person meeting between Suga and Modi, who had developed a close relationship with former Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe.Suga was expected to discuss cooperation in a wide range of areas, ranging from maritime security to development of resilient supply chains and joint projects in third countries, during the visit. India and Japan have also been working closely within the framework of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue or Quad, and Suga and his India counterpart Narendra Modi participated in the first leaders’ summit of the grouping last month. Japan is set to provide financing to ramp up the production of Covid-19 vaccines in India for distribution to developing countries in the Indo-Pacific. Japan, along with the US, has taken the lead in enhancing cooperation through the Quad, which also includes Australia, to ensure a rules-based order and freedom of navigation in the South and East China Sea. Japan has also backed India’s call for the restoration of the status quo on the Line of Actual Control amid the dragging military standoff with China. The cancellation of Suga’s visit follows British Prime Minister Boris Johnson calling off a trip to New Delhi on April 25. Modi has also cancelled a planned visit to Portugal next month for the India-European Union Summit. Johnson and Modi will hold a virtual meeting on April 26 and the India-EU Summit too will be held in a virtual format. There are no plans as of now for a virtual meeting between the Indian and Japanese premiers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/japan-pm-calls-off-visit-to-india-philippines-due-to-critical-covid-situation-101619032364768.html
22-04-2021||India||IAF chief flags off 4 Rafale jets||New Delhi: Indian Air Force (IAF) chief Air Chief Marshal RKS Bhadauria on Wednesday flagged off four Rafale fighter jets from Merignac-Bordeaux airbase in France to India, officials familiar with the development said. This is the fifth ferry of Rafale jets from France to India and their arrival will take the total number of French-origin fighters in the IAF inventory to 18. “Air Chief Marshal RKS Bhadauria on an official tour to France lauds pilots & sees off the next batch of Rafales on a non-stop flight to India with mid-air refueling by French Air force & UAE. Thanks France esp FASF (French Air and Space Force) & French Industry for timely delivery & pilot training on schedule despite covid,” the Indian embassy in France said on Twitter. Bhadauria reached France on a five-day official visit on Monday. The fighters are expected to land at an Indian airbase late Wednesday night. India ordered 36 warplanes from France (equivalent of two squadrons) in September 2016 for ₹59,000 crore under a government-to-government deal. The arrival of four jets will enable the completion of the first squadron of these fighters in Ambala and set the stage for raising the second squadron at Hasimara in West Bengal. All the 36 planes are likely to join the IAF’s fighter fleet by the year-end. Bhadauria, who visited the Rafale conversion training centre in France on Wednesday, said: “The Centre has provided world-class training and it is because of the level and quality of training that we were able to operationalise the aircraft quickly. It is to the credit of the French industry that despite the Covid restrictions, they were able to meet the training requirements in time, and deliver all the aircraft so far more or less in time.” He said some planes were delivered ahead of time. “This has really contributed to the overall combat potential of IAF. I would like to thank the French government, French air force and the industry,” he said.IAF has operated the fighter jets in the Ladakh theatre where the military is on high alert amid a border standoff with China and where both sides are negotiating disengagement of troops at friction points along the contested Line of Actual Control (LAC). India’s Rafale jets are equipped with modern weapons such as the Meteor beyond visual range air-to-air missiles, Mica multi-mission air-to-air missiles, Scalp deep-strike cruise missiles and the Hammer smart weapon. India-specific enhancements on the jets include cold engine start capability to operate from high-altitude bases such as Leh, radar warning receivers, flight data recorders with storage for 10 hours of data, infrared search and track systems, jammers and towed decoys to ward off incoming missiles. The twin-engine jet is capable of carrying out a variety of missions -- ground and sea attack, air defence and air superiority, reconnaissance, and nuclear strike deterrence. It can carry more than nine tonnes of weapons on 14 hard points.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/iaf-chief-flags-off-4-rafale-jets-101619032304162.html
22-04-2021||India||Very few infected after 2nd dose of Covid vaccine: Centre||A minuscule fraction of people contracted Covid-19 in India after being vaccinated, the central government announced on Wednesday, aiming to boost public confidence in the efficacy of the inoculation drive that is crucial to fighting a devastating surge in infections ravaging the country.Government experts cited official data to say that between two and four people per 10,000 vaccinated persons contracted the infection after getting the shots. They attributed this tiny number to the large number of healthcare professionals and frontline workers -- who were immunised in the first phase of the drive -- who work in conditions with a high risk of exposure to the virus.The phenomenon of getting infected after vaccination is called breakthrough infection.The government said a total of 11 million beneficiaries received Covaxin, the two-dose shot manufactured by Bharat Biotech and developed in association with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) .Out of this, 9.3 million people received one shot and 4,208 were infected afterwards -- or 0.04%. Around 1.7 million people received both shots and 695 were infected later, again around 0.04%, announced ICMR director general Dr Balram Bhargava.For Covishield -- the two-dose jab developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca and manufactured by Serum Institute of India -- approximately 100 million people received the first dose and 17,145 were infected later, or around 0.02%. And, 15 million people received both doses and only 5014 were infected afterwards, or around .03%.“So this is a very, very, very small number. Only 2 to 4 per 10,000 breakthrough infections have occurred, which is a very small number,” Bhargava said.He attributed even this tiny fraction of breakthrough infections to frontline and healthcare workers and the current second wave that has swamped the country.“This is because healthcare and frontline workers who were the first to be vaccinated and they are prone to more occupational exposure and, therefore, this is the number. And this is a very very small number and not at all worrisome, and vaccination should continue. The second point is this current highly transmissible second wave may also contribute, a little bit, very miniscule, otherwise this may have been even zero per cent,” he added.Experts said the very small number were important to show that the vaccines were effective and dispel any hesitancy and misinformation around the inoculation drive.“If you look at the numbers then it clearly shows it is a relatively small number. Also, given that respiratory vaccines do not have 100% efficacy,” said Jacob John, former virology, head, Christian Medical College (CMC) Vellore, Tamil Nadu.The second wave is spreading at a great rate, with at least 146 districts currently showing a case positivity rate of at least 15%. The case positivity rate -- a ratio of positive cases to total tests, and a measure of the scale of the outbreak in a region -- should ideally remain under 5%, say experts.Comparative data between the two Covid-19 waves shared by the Centre also showed more children under the age of 10 and elderly above 80 were dying due to the infection in the current wave.So far this year, 0.3% children below 10 have succumbed to the viral infection, which was 0.2% in the previous wave last year. More elderly patients are also dying, with data showing 9.8% mortality among 80 and above this year as compared to 7.8% last year. This percentage is also high for those between 70 and 80, with 22.16% deaths as compared to 19.99% last year. The other age categories show more or less similar trends.“Elderly obviously are more prone to developing serious disease but this time the number of children who are getting infected is higher. Transmissibility this time seems quite high,” said Dr GC Khilnani, former head, pulmonology department, All India institute of Medical Sciences, Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/very-few-infected-after-2nd-dose-of-covid-vaccinecentre-101619032244117.html

22-04-2021||India||B’desh seeks speedy delivery of vaccines||New Delhi The Bangladesh government has requested its Indian counterpart to expedite the delivery of about 500,000 doses of Covid-19 vaccines to ensure the rollout of the immunisation programme in the neighbouring country isn’t affected, people familiar with developments said on Wednesday. The matter was raised by the Bangladesh high commission in New Delhi and authorities in Dhaka over the past few days against the backdrop of concerns among Bangladeshi authorities about the delay in supply of doses that were contracted from Serum Institute of India (SII), the people cited above said on condition of anonymity. There was no official response from Indian officials on the matter. The Indian side said recently that exports of Covid-19 vaccines will be rolled out in a phased manner and delivery schedules will be calibrated in sync with domestic requirements. However, concerns have grown in several countries that have signed commercial agreements with SII as India’s domestic vaccine needs have increased significantly following a massive spike in infections and the government’s plans to open up the vaccination drive to everyone above the age of 18 from May 1. The people said the Bangladeshi side was solely dependent on vaccine supplies from India after it opted not to procure Chinese-made doses despite offers from Beijing. Any prolonged delay in the delivery of doses by SII could hit the rollout of the vaccination drive in Bangladesh, the people said. Bangladeshi authorities are also looking at the possibility of acquiring the Sputnik V vaccine developed by Russia, the people added. India has so far supplied 3.3 million doses of Covishield as grants to Bangladesh, while the country received another seven million doses as commercial supplies. The supplies began in January and the last delivery – 100,000 doses provided as a grant – was made on April 2. Bangladesh signed a commercial contract with SII last year to buy 30 million doses, and under the terms of the deal, the country should receive five million doses a month between January and June. The Nepal government too is awaiting the delivery of a million doses of Covishield contracted from SII. Nepal foreign minister Pradeep Gyawali had raised the delay in delivery of the doses during a phone conversation with his Indian counterpart S Jaishankar on April 9. People familiar with developments in Kathmandu said there had been no word from the Indian side regarding the delivery of the shots.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bdesh-seeks-speedy-delivery-of-vaccines-101619031944200.html
22-04-2021||India||SII: Covishield at ₹400 to states, ₹600 to pvt hospitals||Covishield will be available to state governments at the rate of ₹400 per dose and at ₹600 per dose to private hospitals, Serum Institute of India announced on Wednesday, becoming the first company to disclose the pricing under the new, open-market mechanism for coronavirus vaccinations from next month.The Union government has allowed 50% of the vaccines manufactured in India to be sold separately, which can be used to administer doses to all adults from May 1. At present, only people above the age of 45 are eligible for the vaccines as part of the Centre’s vaccination programme.“For the next two months, we will address the limited capacity by scaling up the vaccine production. Going ahead, 50% of our capacities will be served to the Government of India’s vaccination program, and the remaining 50% of the capacity will be for the state governments and private hospitals,” said Serum Institute of India in a statement.SII locally manufactures the Oxford-AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine AZD1222 under the brand name Covishield. It is one of the two make-in-India vaccines approved for restricted emergency use – the other being Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin.In an interview to TV channel CNBC-TV 18, SII CEO Adar Poonawalla said the company will start signing contracts with private hospitals within a couple of weeks, and hopes to fulfil the contracts by the third or fourth week of May.It is likely that this is when people between the age of 18 and 45 will be able to get the first of the doses in these age groups.“Serum Institute of India (SII), welcomes the recent announcement made by Government of India’s Ministry of Health and Finance Ministry to accelerate India’s vaccination drive. The promising directives will help to scale- up vaccine production, and allow state governments, private hospitals, and vaccination centers to procure vaccines directly,” the statement further read.According to the company, it is ensuring that India’s vaccines are affordable in comparison to any other vaccines in the world, considering the global vaccine prices.Globally, American vaccines in open market currently cost about ₹1500 per dose, Russian and Chinese vaccines cost around ₹750 per dose.The company also expressed its inability to meet with the demands of individual corporate houses given the supply constraints.“Furthermore, owing to the complexity, and urgency of the situation it is challenging to supply it independently to each corporate entity. We would urge all corporate and private individuals to access the vaccines through the state facilitated machinery and private health systems. After 4-5 months, the vaccines will be made available in retail and free trade,” the statement read.SII’s current Covishield production capacity is about 60 million doses a month, and it is looking at ramping it up to more than a 100 million doses a month by July.Union government officials said on Wednesday that vaccine manufacturers will have to declare rates before May 1. “On the basis of these rates, state hospitals, private hospitals can procure doses. It doesn’t mean vaccines will be available at chemist shops,” said Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan.The official added that beginning May 1, private hospitals will have to procure their vaccines exclusively through these channels. “They won’t be given separately. Pricing will be monitored,” he said.Niti Aayog member (health) VK Paul said the country expects more capacity to be added by August. “Discussions are on with other makers. Biological E’s trials are over, after that they will go phase 3. They have major capacity – of over 70 mn a year. We believe by August, it will be available,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sii-covishield-at-400-to-states-600-to-pvt-hospitals-101619031824067.html
22-04-2021||India||Christian Michel seeks bail on basis of UN report that said his detention was arbitrary||Christian Michel, the alleged middleman in the AgustaWestland VVIP helicopter deal, has sought bail in cases registered against him by the CBI and Enforcement Directorate on the grounds that a UN panel had ruled that his detention was arbitrary. The bail application is expected to be listed for hearing in the court of special judge Arvind Kumar on Thursday, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity. Michel, a British national, has been held in India since December 2018 after being extradited from the United Arab Emirates (UAE). He is currently in Delhi’s Tihar Jail. He was living in Dubai when India sought his extradition for involvement in alleged irregularities in the 2010 deal to acquire 12 AgustaWestland helicopters worth 556.2 million euros for the transportation of VVIPs. At the time, Michel was a middleman and an external consultant for a subsidiary of AgustaWestland. He has denied all the charges levelled against him. Michel’s application for unconditional bail hinges on the report of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention (WGAD), which operates under the office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights. In its findings released in Geneva last month, WGAD concluded Michel’s detention was arbitrary and violated the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. WGAD was scathing in its evaluation of the handling of Michel’s case by the governments of the UAE and India and said both countries should “accord him an enforceable right to compensation and other reparations, in accordance with international law”. Indian officials haven’t formally reacted to WGAD’s findings but even before the formal release of the report, the external affairs ministry said the group’s conclusions were based on “limited information, biased allegations from an unidentified source and on an inaccurate understanding of India’s criminal justice system”. Michel’s bail application, filed on Tuesday, noted that he had spent two years and four months in custody in India and another 50 days in Dubai during his extradition proceedings and that he had undergone “almost 600 hours of custodial interrogation” by the CBI and ED. The application said others arrested in the same case had also been granted bail. The application further said Michel will be available to join “any future investigation and trial, as and when required, and has never sought to evade the process of law”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/christian-michel-seeks-bail-on-basis-of-un-report-that-said-his-detention-was-arbitrary-101619031644562.html

The modus operandi makes us suspect that it is the handiwork of insurgents,” said Amitabh Sinha, police superintendent, Sivasagar.Two of the abducted employees are junior engineer assistants (production) the third one is a junior technician (production).

The abduction took place on a rig site of ONGC in Lakwa field of Sivasagar district,” ONGC tweeted.“The abducted employees were taken by the miscreants in an operational vehicle belonging to ONGC. Later the vehicle was found abandoned near Nimonagarh jungles close to the Assam-Nagaland border. A complaint has been lodged by ONGC with the local police.”In December last year, ULFA-I abducted two employees of a private company from a drilling location in Changlang district of Arunachal Pradesh.

22-04-2021||Today's||On India, the contestation within Pakistan’s army||Over the past few weeks, signs have emerged, like the tips of an iceberg, of an ongoing contestation within Pakistan on the country’s India policy. These indications are important to make an assessment of how far current India-Pakistan endeavours to reduce bilateral tensions can really progress.The February 25 joint statement to cease fire on the Line of Control (LOC) and “all other sectors” is holding. The term “all other sectors” relates to the International Border (IB) in Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) and the Actual Ground Position Line (AGPL) on the Saltoro ridge. The Pakistan army uses the cover of firing along LOC as one of the means to push terrorists into J&K. It would, however, be wrong to assume that the ceasefire is indicative of a shift in its strategic doctrine relating to India — which, on one end of the spectrum, relies on the use of terror and, at the other end, on nuclear weapons. Nevertheless, the ceasefire is welcome relief to those who live along LOC and IB in J&K. Significantly, external affairs minister S Jaishankar and his Pakistani counterpart Shah Mahmood Qureshi were in Abu Dhabi at the same time on official visits a few days ago. In an interview to a leading newspaper in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), on April 18, Qureshi mentioned the joint statement as a “positive development”. He further noted that Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi’s message to PM Imran Khan on Pakistan’s national day in March and India’s “dialling down” of rhetoric and its desire to see a peaceful Afghanistan and region were also “positive developments”. To Qureshi’s positives list can be added reports that India will give visas to the Pakistan cricket team for the ICC T20 World Cup scheduled to be played in India in October this year.Also Read | Pakistan probes shooting of former prominent journalist critical of militaryThese “positive developments” cannot be taken, though, as indicative of the relationship turning a corner — due to the approach of Qureshi and some other important leaders of the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party. The Pakistan government’s about-turn on cotton and sugar imports from India, despite great shortages of both commodities, is a sure manifestation of the pressure that these politicians were able to bring to bear in the cabinet even though the commerce ministry, which is headed by Imran Khan himself, had cleared the proposal. It is inconceivable in view of the dynamics of Pakistan’s foreign and security policymaking that Qureshi and other politicians would openly oppose a move, which had PM Khan’s approval, and was in line with army chief Qamar Bajwa’s stated interest in improving ties with India — unless there was a coterie of senior generals behind them.There can be little doubt that it is this support from the men in khaki which emboldened Qureshi, despite taking note of “positive developments”, to make scathing comments against India on UAE soil. He did so despite the full knowledge that the UAE is seeking to play, at minimum, a facilitation role to help India and Pakistan develop, what UAE’s ambassador to the United States recently called a “healthy functional relationship”.Qureshi said that Pakistan’s greatest achievement in the last two years has been to defeat India’s design to diplomatically isolate Pakistan. He went on to assert that Pakistan was able to expose India’s smear campaign. These are not helpful words for the India-Pakistan process underway and Qureshi, an experienced politician who has served as the country’s foreign minister (though not continuously) for five years, would be aware of this fact.In considering the India-Pakistan relationship, it is important to bear in mind that the Pakistani army has always maintained a stranglehold on its approach towards India. After Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, Pakistan’s civilian leadership, with the exception of former PM Nawaz Sharif, has accepted the army’s key role in all matters pertaining to India. Certainly, Imran Khan, who the Pakistani opposition calls a “selected prime minister”, is in no position to challenge the army. Thus, the future of the current initiatives will depend on whether Bajwa succeeds in fostering a consensus on the India policy among the generals. That is clearly absent today.Retired senior Pakistani generals confided in Indian participants on the “track two” circuit, soon after Bajwa became the army chief, that he seriously wanted to normalise India-Pakistan ties. They also indirectly acknowledged that many of Bajwa’s colleagues were not on the same page with him on this issue. It would seem Bajwa and Khan realise that Pakistan needs to establish a “healthy functional relationship” with India to take it out of its economic and social morass. The recent Tehreek-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) agitation is one more pointer of the deep roots of religious rigidity in Jinnah’s creation.The problem for Bajwa and Khan is that Pakistan went so overboard in its opposition to the constitutional changes in J&K that they will find it difficult to counter the charge of a sell-out, especially if that is the thinking of some senior generals. India should factor this point into its calculations as it proceeds on normalising ties with Pakistan. It should also be prepared for adventurous actions by recalcitrant Pakistani generals.Vivek Katju is a retired diplomat who has extensively dealt with Pakistan The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/on-india-the-contestation-within-pakistan-s-army-101619095610329.html
22-04-2021||Today's||Covid-19: The buck stops at the top||All through his long political career, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been the master of optics — the ability to effectively use the visual image, a slogan, a sharp soundbite at just the right moment in a multimedia age is what has been his distinct leadership weapon. But last week, the well-honed technique of perception management appeared to let down the PM for once. On a day when the daily Covid-19 case count crossed 200,000 for the first time, the PM was busily addressing large election rallies in West Bengal. With little masking and no social distancing at the gathering, he appeared to be operating in a parallel universe to the stark ground realities of a country in the midst of another severe Covid wave. In his public communication, Modi has repeatedly urged people to observe “do gaz ki doori”, and, yet, now he was happily seen rousing frenzied crowds to gather in even greater numbers. The imagery and messaging were strikingly jarring.To be fair, to expect the PM not to campaign in a high-stakes election battle like Bengal is like asking Virat Kohli to withdraw from the world test championships final. As a consummate political campaigner, Modi was never going to back off from hitting the road aggressively. This is his standard formula for fighting and winning elections: Modi and his chief aide, home minister Amit Shah, take no prisoners when in election mode. Also Read | Offered India not-for-profit price for Covid-19 vaccine: PfizerBut every formula must be rejigged in extraordinary times. Could the PM, for example, have not used the BJP’s vast digital footprint to address more people online? Maybe, more realistically, the Election Commission itself should have been nudged to curtail a crazily elongated election schedule. The key here is to set an example that others will be encouraged to embrace; true leadership is about being a step ahead of the competition, not becoming part of the multitude.Unfortunately, a hyper-polarised society runs the risk of being trapped in the noise of constant politicking. This is precisely the trap the Modi government has got ensnared in, at a time when its single-minded focus should have been on how to tackle Covid-19. In the past year, the Centre has been engaged in a variety of bruising battles, each of which exhausted political capital and mindspace at the wrong time. Was it really necessary, for example, to push through contentious farm legislation in Parliament at a time when there was an urgent need to build political consensus on how to fight a public health emergency? Far too many political distractions, marked by a sense of infallibility, meant that the eye was lifted from the Covid gaze. Having won the November Bihar election in particular, it seems as if an all-powerful Modi government felt that its political agenda would trump all else. If citizens were guilty of letting their guard down because of Covid fatigue, the Centre too seemed caught in Covid hubris, convinced that it was fully in control of the situation, without accounting for the dangerous red signals that were beginning to flash. The disjointed vaccine policy is a classic example of being stuck in an echo chamber of cheerleaders who were already waving celebratory flags of conquering the coronavirus when the urgent need was to prepare for worst-case scenarios. Why, for example, the rush to export vaccines outside existing global commitments without first getting the domestic situation fully in control? By restricting the number of vaccine options, not placing enough firm vaccine supply orders in advance, adopting a rigid quota-permit raj for vaccine distribution in each state, not doing enough to fund and incentivise private sector manufacturers, and not offering flexibility in vaccinating people across age groups, a bureaucratic maze was created. This prevented fast-tracking the vaccine rollout at a crucial time. The latest policy course correction is welcome but that the world’s leading vaccine manufacturer is now desperately rushing to import vaccines to meet shortages reflects how the battle to contain the pandemic is a long and complicated one. The Opposition would, of course, like to pin the entire blame on the Modi government for being seemingly ill-prepared to combat the second Covid wave. Hasn’t Congress leader, Rahul Gandhi, after all, been forewarning the Centre of pitfalls in its Covid management, warnings that have been met with typically dismissive reactions? And yet, can one really say that the Congress or Opposition-ruled states are in any better shape to combat Covid than BJP-governed states? The virus doesn’t know of political boundaries and there isn’t a magic mantra to tackle a pandemic. But if the Centre is quick to take credit for anything positive that happens in new India, then it must accept its share of blame for missteps. When it centralises power and micromanages decision-making but refuses to share even basic information on money spent through PM-Cares on fighting Covid 19, then it must also be held accountable when things don’t go to plan. The buck this time stops at the top. Post-script: Nothing quite exemplifies the mess in Covid decision making than the unseemly war of words last week between the Maharashtra government and the Centre over shortage in oxygen and remdesivir supplies. When Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray claimed that the Prime Minister was uncontactable because he was campaigning in Bengal, Union minister Piyush Goyal hit back, accusing the Maharashtra government of “corruption” and “ineptitude”. Just wonder: isn’t there a hotline between Delhi and Mumbai for Covid crisis management, or will every issue become a political slanging match on Twitter?Rajdeep Sardesai is a senior journalist and authorThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/covid19-the-buck-stops-at-the-top-101619093690323.html
22-04-2021||Today's||An open letter to farmers: Suspend your agitation||I write as a senior citizen, on behalf of them, among others, who are exposed to the vicious second surge of the virus. Those who take precautions with great care also get afflicted because of the sheer load around us of those who are not taking any care, and being callously careless.I also write on behalf of seniors among you, in your homes, and the countless in the areas around where your massed protests are located — their vulnerability to the virus has increased many times over as a result of the great convergence. The elderly and those who, for livelihood reasons, have to venture out, are now at great risk, even fatal risk. This risk is far greater than it was last year.Your being massed in protest sites around the national capital for the greater part of a year has drawn international attention, acclaim. The spirit behind your protest has been spontaneously sympathised with, even by those who may not agree with all your demands. I am among those who believe that justice is on your side. I cannot reconcile to your interests being compromised in any way.Also Watch | ‘Want vaccine centres here’: Rakesh Tikait says protest sites are farmers’ homeBut I have this appeal to make to you, great farming-soldiers, soldier-farmers: Recognising the peril of the virus and the grim fact that your agitation is unwittingly fuelling the virus, please suspend your agitation now.Surely, it cannot be your intention to cause any innocent person the slightest harm. But by staying massed as you are, with members of the protest groups returning to the villages and then coming back, without realising it, you are becoming accomplices to the risk. That is something that you do not, cannot, want.I have appealed to the government, in the interests of public health, to scrap the three acts you are objecting to. Or at least to suspend them in toto until the virus is brought under control. But I have not had even an acknowledgment. I have also appealed to valued friends who are part of your agitation, to persuade you to suspend the agitation until the virus is brought under control. This too has not received (except from the tireless P Sainath) notice or acknowledgment.Hence, this open appeal. The virus is India’s public enemy number one at this moment. It is vicious, murderous. Just see the pictures of those who have died or been bereaved by Covid-19 deaths. They could be you or me, your or my loved ones.The three farm acts are at this juncture, less, far less, of a menace. I am not saying the acts are not to be opposed; far from it. I am only saying that there is such a thing as a wrong time for doing even a right thing. This is not the time to converge in hundreds around a city where the virus is dancing the dance of death-by-crowding. I am not asking you to stop it or end the agitation. Only to dismantle its present form and keep it dismantled until the virus is completely under control.Holding mammoth election rallies, processions and door to door campaigns has been a great folly. Exposing hundreds of thousands to the virus at the kumbh mela has been another monumental wrong. It should not be said of you, great and wise kisans, that you have been as callous, as uncaring, as insensitive in the battle against the virusPlease suspend the agitation and announce a return of the protesters to their villages, to get vaccinated. You will thereby get the gratitude of the whole country and the admiration of all those across the world who are watching your stamina and your zeal for justice. Do not misunderstand me, dear fellow-citizens, when I say that the wave of public sympathy stands in danger of waning if the perception gains ground that you do not care if the virus spreads.I know you do care, for you are passionate human beings, loving parents and doting children. And above all, patriots of the first order, many of you being ex-jawans and retired officers of the armed forces yourselves.In great pride of your courage and your common sense,Jai Hind.Gopalkrishna Gandhi is a former administrator and diplomat who has also served as the governor of West BengalThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/an-open-letter-to-farmers-suspend-your-agitation-101619093210360.html
22-04-2021||Editorials||Oxygen: Beg, borrow, steal||On Thursday, the home ministry ordered that there will be no restriction on inter-state and intra-state supply of oxygen-related goods, and reiterated that the supply of oxygen for industrial purposes, except that exempted by the government, is strictly prohibited. The order came on the heels of three related developments. One, states and Union territories such as Delhi alleged that their oxygen supply was being blocked by neighbouring states. Second, hospitals moved the Delhi High Court, which directed the Centre to supply oxygen at any cost (and it speaks of the enormity of today’s crisis that hospitals have to go to court to find ways to procure and buy oxygen in the first place). And three, the Supreme Court asked the Centre to present a national road map on Covid-19 management, including the oxygen distribution plan. Prime Minister Narendra Modi also chaired a high-level meeting to review oxygen supply across the country. As the brutal second wave of the pandemic has hit India, there has been almost a war over oxygen cylinders among states, and between states and the Centre. This is both a symbol of an existing crisis in Indian federalism, as well as a further blow to the federal compact. And there is little doubt that the Centre has to take a larger share of the responsibility. At a time when patients and their families are desperately looking for hospital beds, medicines and oxygen, the Centre should play the role of an unbiased administrator, unveil a proper distribution pattern, and unclog the legal and administrative bottlenecks to ensure fair and timely distribution of medical supplies. But that hasn’t happened so far because it failed to anticipate the scale of the crisis and need for oxygen. Industry experts say India has the capacity to produce more than 7,000 metric tonnes of medical oxygen, but the problem is there are not enough cylinders and tankers to store and transport it. India also does not have enough cryogenic tankers to ensure 24×7 road transport of medical oxygen. There are also the problems of wastage and leakages in hospital pipelines that supply oxygen. Successive governments have overlooked these issues, this government also took its eye off the ball, and citizens now are paying the price. As the Delhi High Court said, “beg, borrow, steal” — but find a way to help citizens to breathe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/oxygen-beg-borrow-steal-101619104134530.html
22-04-2021||Editorials||The story of Covid, Kumbh and Bengal||When the former king of Nepal, Gyanendra Shah, and his wife, Komal, tested positive for Covid-19, it took little detective work to know how they had got infected. Mr Shah, whose autocratic and unpopular rule led to the end of the monarchy in Nepal, had chosen to visit the Kumbh Mela in Haridwar — and an image of him, bare-chested, without a mask, in the middle of hundreds of religious men, on the ghats, immediately went viral. Mr Shah, like the hundreds of thousands who visited the Kumbh, had perhaps thought faith alone would defeat the virus. It didn’t.With West Bengal showing a consistent rise in cases — it was over 10,000 on Wednesday — it also takes little detective work to understand that one factor contributing to the surge is the nature of the election campaign — which, incidentally, is still underway. Political leaders risked their lives and the lives of all those who attended the rallies and continue to do so. They perhaps thought that political power would defeat the virus. It didn’t, and it won’t. It is alarming that even after India has acquired the grim record of having the highest number of cases in any country in the world ever since the pandemic broke out, the most basic principles of protecting oneself — and others — have to be reiterated. Don’t hold large gatherings, don’t meet people unless you have to, maintain social distancing norms, and stay home. India is struggling with adhering to every norm that can help patients battle the disease; even though the management of this disease is challenging, and lives are at stake. Lockdown or no lockdown, any group, which continues to hold large gatherings, is doing a disservice to the nation at this time. Political parties should wake up.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/the-story-of-covid-kumbh-and-bengal-101619104070825.html
