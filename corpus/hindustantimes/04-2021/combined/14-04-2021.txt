14-04-2021||News||West Bengal 2021: Where the national hegemon is a local rebel||Overwhelming mandates, before they are lost, are frittered away. This can happen on account of errors of both omission and commission. Such errors have their origins in various factors — lack of vision and political foresight, hubris, and often, complacency on account of the lack of a strong opposition.To be sure, just the fact that the incumbent has frittered away the mandate does not entail an automatic electoral upset. The existing opposition might not be in a position to challenge the incumbent. And, even when a new opposition emerges, it takes time for it to establish itself as the main challenger to the opposition. Once it has done so, it takes a counter-narrative to convince the electorate to decisively vote out the incumbent.In 2016, the All India Trinamool Congress (TMC) won 211 out of the 294 assembly constituencies (AC) in West Bengal with a 45.6% vote share. This was the largest ever mandate for any single party in the state. The TMC’s stellar success in 2016 came on the back of a big victory in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, when it won 34 out of the 42 Lok Sabha constituencies in the state despite a nationwide Narendra Modi wave.The TMC and its leader Mamata Banerjee saw the 2014 and 2016 success as a sign of hopelessly divided opposition and no immediate threat to the TMC’s fortunes in the future. In doing so, it made the cardinal sin of assuming that a realignment of opposition votes will never take place to pose a bigger challenge to it.The sense of having a weak opposition also led to complacency on the political-ideological front where efforts were not made to counter-strategise against a tectonic shift — the rise of the Baharatiya Janata Party (BJP) as India’s new national political hegemon — underway in national politics.The fact that ideology was not in command as far as the TMC is concerned was also a result of two additional factors. The first is the lack of any coherent ideological anchor for the TMC as a party, which has been its characteristic feature since the beginning. TMC’s political allies have, so far, included both BJP and the Congress among electoral players, and its support base has ranged from Kolkata’s urban elite to Maoist activists/sympathisers in the state. The second is the inability of the government, especially its leader Mamata Banerjee, to evolve an alternative political economy vision for her government beyond the politics of throwing doles at every problem.Also Read | Banned for 24 hours, Mamata Banerjee to resume campaigning tonightIt is this frittering away of the massive 2016 mandate which has brought the TMC at the cusp of loss of political power in the state. Most common voters do not see any harm in a change after 10 years. Even the strongest supporters of the TMC do not see their party more than scraping through in these elections. The BJP, on the other hand, is claiming that it is all set to stage a massive upset, perhaps at a scale which is greater than what the TMC inflicted on the 34-year-old Communist Party of India (Marxist) or CPI(M)-led Left Front government, in the 2011 elections.HT travelled across Kolkata, North and South 24 Parganas, East and West Bardhaman and Birbhum districts of the politically crucial South Bengal region. It is the only region in the state — there are 167 ACs spread across eight districts — where the TMC could prevent the BJP from finishing ahead of it in the 2019 elections, to understand the prevailing political sentiment in the state.There seems to be a political consensus about the direction of the wind. There are strong headwinds for the TMC and tailwinds for the BJP. The only uncertainty which exists currently is regarding the magnitude of this change. Here are some factors which will matter in the 2021 contest for West Bengal.TMC’s governance model: Weak state or deliberately weakened state? Relief work, or lack of it, post Amphan, the massive cyclone which hit many districts of South Bengal in early 2020, is being seen as a big source of anti-incumbency for the TMC in these elections. That it took days to restore power supply even in the posh areas of the state capital was seen as a sign of a dysfunctional state apparatus under the TMC.Such an inference would be far-fetched, said a senior government official who spoke to HT on the condition of anonymity. The state can be very strong and effective if it wants to be. Its ability or lack of it to perform its designated functions is more a question of political will and the inputs which go into political decision-making, which is pretty much confined to just one person, the chief minister, he said.Take an example.Last year, the West Bengal government announced that it would give tablets to class 12 students to facilitate online learning as schools were closed in the lockdown. The announcement was made before the logistics were discussed. Once the government started the procurement process, it realised that it would take lot more time to get the tablets than was expected. Within weeks, the scheme was changed to a cash transfer of ₹10,000 for each beneficiary. Students in interior villages acknowledged having received the money. But a school principal in Kolkata said the government delegated the responsibility of submitting utilisation certificates for the scheme to schools, which the staff clearly saw as an extra burden.Not all governance-related matters can, however, be solved as easily as the shift from tablets to cash. Centralisation and ignoring due processes does not help in avoiding such mishaps at every step.The disdain for due process is a direct by-product of the government’s, in this case, the chief minister’s vision, the official quoted above said. It consists of a cocktail of offering doles and what is termed as “cosmetic development”, a term which perhaps does not exist anywhere else in the country. The latter is best captured by decisions such as starting a “Floating Market” in Patuli area of Kolkata. It has, unsurprisingly, ended up as a stinking conglomeration of shops on a drain. The announcement was in line with Banerjee’s promise of making Kolkata like London — when you drive into the city from the airport, you can see a Big Ben replica on your way — but whether this vision is operationalised through due process or adequate consultation or even thinking through the implications is unclear.The state government boasts of a lot of welfare schemes and handouts targeted at everyone, from women and students to Durga Puja committees and clerics. This has come at a financial cost for a state which has always been in dire straits. And these are not just infrastructure or investment-related costs. State government employees have seen their dearness allowances delayed, and the lower one goes down the hierarchy, the more angry government employees are about it.Also Read | Amit Shah to address ‘potho sabha’ in Bengal today, more planned by BJP as part of outreach strategyAnybody in the bureaucracy who criticises or even expresses scepticism about these things runs the risk of being sidelined, or worse, being branded as a potential saboteur. The senior bureaucracy has taken the cue and decided that it is best not to bell the cat, the officer HT spoke to said.Sometimes, this leads to even otherwise good work being compromised. When Covid-19 broke out in the city, the government-run Bangur hospital provided one of the best services, even better than private hospitals in the city. But this goodwill was frittered away once the government started withholding data to show that the state had a low Covid-19 case count, generating friction with the Centre in the initial weeks of the pandemic.The worst-affected arm of the state apparatus on this count has been the police. The police is seen as colluding with the ruling party to persecute its opponents, while giving a free pass to the ruling party’s Mastans (the Bengali slang for goons). But its worst manifestation was seen during the 2018 panchayat elections, when the TMC cadre vitiated democratic process at multiple levels. That the Election Commission is receiving complaints and acting against police station level officers is the best example of how compromised the ground-level police have become.To be sure, West Bengal had its share of political intervention in governance even earlier. However, the magnitude of these problems has increased manifold compared to the days when the CPI(M) was in power. Unlike the CPI(M), the TMC does not have an ideologically aligned party apparatus. What it has are a bunch of strongmen in districts, who seek glory in their reputation of not playing by the rules.To cut a long story short, the electorate gave a bigger mandate to the TMC in 2016 than it had in 2011. But the government’s delivery and its bonafides went down in the second term.Secularism: Baptism by fire for even Muslims One of the biggest reasons why the TMC is seen having an edge against the BJP is the sizeable population of Muslims in West Bengal. They constituted 27% of the state’s population in the 2011 census. Minority “appeasement” is among the biggest campaign planks of the BJP in these elections. Common Muslims, HT spoke to, reveal how this is true and false at the same time.South 24 Parganas district is among the most densely populated areas in the world and extends from Kolkata up to the Sunderban delta. It was also one of the worst affected districts in Amphan. The TMC has faced a lot of criticism for corruption and favouritism in administering Amphan relief. Muslims account for 35.6% of the district’s population.A group of Muslim women in a village in Bhangur told HT that they did not receive any post-Amphan assistance and their houses do not even have roofs. They are have making do with a plastic sheet. However, the TMC has been proactive enough to make a new place for offering Namaz (Muslim prayers) in the village. It came up just two -and-a-half months before the elections.Aren’t you angry, we asked? Raag kore ki labh (what do we gain from getting angry), came the answer.The roots of this answer are two-fold. The first is common across the country. As the BJP becomes an ascendant force, the dominant secular party can afford to take Muslim support for granted. The second is a unique and extremely perverse feature of West Bengal politics. Canning East, the assembly constituency (AC) adjacent to Bhangur, and also a Muslim majority AC, was voting the day HT visited the area.The main contest here was between the incumbent MLA and TMC strongman Shaukat Mollah and Gazi Shahabuddin Siraji, the candidate of the newly floated Indian Secular Front (ISF), which is an ally of the CPI(M) and the Congress. HT followed the ISF candidate in a few polling booths. His main challenge was to encourage his supporters to come out and vote without fear of retribution from the TMC. The central forces are on the polling booth, but the TMC Mastans are standing inside villages and threatening our supporters against voting, one of his local level leaders said. In one village, TMC supporters hurled bombs at the ISF supporters and the latter collectively resisted the attack. By the evening, reports started coming in that it was Shaukat Mollah who went and sat on a dharna alleging malpractices in the elections.Because the party-society model of West Bengal seeks complete domination even at the grassroots level, this makes even Muslims, who do not want to toe the TMC’s party-line, potential targets of the TMC’s strong-arm tactics. While the ISF is likely to be the biggest beneficiary of this anger in these elections, even the BJP gains from it at places.Baduria AC in North 24-Parganas and Bolpur AC in Birbhum district are very different in terms of population and terrain. The former has a 70% share of Muslims, while the latter has an equal share of Hindus. Baduria witnessed large scale communal riots in 2017 after a derogatory social media post about Prophet Mohammad. However in both places, HT found a couple of Muslims within the ranks of BJP activists.Why are they with the BJP, we asked? They have either faced violence or persecution at the hands of the TMC, we were told. Mohsin, a young Muslim man in Baduria, who works for a left-leaning organisation called the Young Bengal, said he was beaten up and receives threats by the local Muslim leadership of the TMC because he went to vote against them.The BJP is pragmatic enough to take advantage of such discontent where it can tap it. The photograph of a Muslim man whispering in the ears of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in one of his rallies, and promise of better functioning welfare schemes, where political partisanship will not lead to exclusion, is trying to do exactly that.None of this is to say that the TMC will suffer large-scale losses in its Muslims strongholds. At best, there will be some upsets. But the rural electorate of the state, including Muslims, know the asymmetric burden they have to bear for the cause of secularism, if saving it requires keeping the TMC in power. Given a chance, they would be happy to get rid of it.BJP’s everyday communalism has embraced the ghosts of partition in West BengalThe Bangladesh border is not even hundred kilometres from Kolkata. Migration, both of Muslims and Hindus, has happened on a large scale and continues to take place.In the Namashudra (a large dalit group in West Bengal) dominated Gobardanga area in Bangaon Lok Sabha's Gaighata AC in the North 24 Parganas district one can distinguish the new refuges from the old by looking at houses. The new ones have tin walls, while the older ones live in traditional pakka houses.Namashudras are the most prominent among Hindu migrants from Bangladesh and the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, which seeks to grant citizenship status to Hindus but not Muslims, is an important political issue for them, and the BJP is capitalising on it. “The BJP’s victory in West Bengal is crucial for the internal and external security of India, otherwise anti-India forces will succeed in their ‘Greater Bangladesh’ project,” said Sudip Ghosh a senior BJP leader in Baraipur town in South 24-Parganas.In order to pre-empt the campaign by opponents of the National Register of Citizens (NRC) and CAA — that they might be sent to detention camps or fail to produce necessary documents — the BJP has promised a payment of ₹50,000 over five years in its manifesto to applicants who seek to utilise the CAA route.That the TMC has not made NRC-CAA a big point of its campaign shows its unwillingness to take a principled stand against the policy, lest it lose the Namashudra vote. A large number of Namashudras who have migrated from Bangladesh, are likely to have faced persecution at the hands of Muslims in the neighbouring country.Local level intimidation, to the extent of not allowing opponents to put up even party flags is common in West Bengal. When HT travelled with Anirban Ganguly, the BJP candidate in Bolpur AC, during his campaign, one of his stops was at the place of a BJP worker in Dharmpur village who was beaten up by TMC goons while putting up BJP flags. The supporter in question also happened to be a saffron clad Sadhu (monk). The BJP candidate did not forget to highlight this issue while registering his protest. The monk’s peers across the AC were planning a protest at the local Ilambazar police station against the violence. We will contact other organisations in Kolkata and Delhi too, the candidate said.It is exactly this phenomenon, the conversion of local decentralised conflicts – any BJP activist, monk or no monk, would have faced violence from the TMC in that village – into communal ones, which has been described by political scientists Sudha Pai and Sajjan Kumar as everyday communalism in their 2017 book published by the Oxford University Press.Between entrenched communal fault-lines which date back to the partition, gifts of everyday communalism which the TMC keeps delivering to the BJP and the perception of minority “appeasement”, it is not surprising that religious polarisation is at an all-time high in the state.Enter Narendra Modi: The man who can do no wrongKolkata is perhaps the least ghettoised metro in India when it comes to class-based segregation. The poor and the rich still live in close proximity in most parts of the city.Lala Colony is a dalit settlement in ward number 61 of Kolkata Municipal Corporation. HT spoke to a street vendor who sells puris to make a living. How has business been after the pandemic, we asked? It has collapsed, he said. What about price rise? It hurts, the answer came.Shouldn’t the BJP be held responsible? That is where the faith in the central leadership of the party, particularly Narendra Modi, comes in. “How much can one man do? When the lockdown happened, we got free LPG cylinders under the Ujjwala Yojna. Women got ₹500 in their accounts. Modi cannot give these things out of his pocket, he must recover the costs from somewhere. I know some people who sold their Ujjwala LPG cylinder to others, but at least they made some money. When the economy revives, then our fortunes will also revive, right now all countries are facing a difficult time. At least, Modi does not differentiate on the basis of religion while distributing relief,” he added, clearly taking a potshot at the TMC.That the BJP keeps trying to, and with great success, insulate Modi’s image from policy failure or the economy’s poor performance is a well known factor. What is surprising is the fact that the acceptability of this campaign, especially among the poorest, does not seem to fade. In fact, the appeal becomes stronger as one moves from cities to villages where income opportunities are scarce and poverty higher. That large parts of West Bengal are among the poorest regions in the country only increases the attractiveness of the central government welfare schemes which might appear paltry if income levels were higher.It is not surprising that the BJP first broke ground in the Scheduled Tribe (ST) dominated Jangal Mahal sub-region of the state. Even today, the BJP considers Scheduled Caste (SC) and ST voters, the poorest in the state, to be its biggest support base among the Hindus in the state.The politics of centralised delivery of welfare benefits, something Yamini Aiyar and Neelanjan Sircar have described in a 2020 paper, is a crucial factor in this development. Poor voters believe that the TMC government has blocked central government’s welfare benefits in the state and they stand to gain once the BJP comes to power, a BJP activist in Bolpur told HT.There is some amount of truth to this claim. West Bengal is the only major state which does not allow PM-KISAN transfers to farmers. In one of his rallies, Narendra Modi directly addressed the state bureaucracy and asked that lists of farmers be prepared in advance so that the payments can be made once the BJP comes to power.The organisational deficit of the BJP and how it is making up for it In ward number 61 of Kolkata, the BJP did not even have a polling agent at the booth in the 2019 elections. It still got 4,000 votes. The street vendor, quoted above, admitted to participating in all processions of the TMC, but said he will vote for the BJP. Many local activists of the TMC and CPI(M) acknowledge this fact — potential BJP voters are masquerading as TMC workers.The BJP’s organisational challenge is more acute in rural areas though. Anirban Ganguly, the BJP candidate from Bolpur, is a rank outsider to his AC, technically speaking. He heads the Shyama Prasad Mukherjee Research Foundation, a party-affiliated think tank in Delhi, and has been leading the BJP’s “intellectual outreach” in the state in the past few years. Bolpur votes on April 29, and the BJP is trying very hard to put up polling agent in every booth. Ganguly is hands-on with everything from planning his campaign schedule to deciding rally venues and taking care of the intra-organisation friction. In a well-oiled organisation, a candidate would not have to deal with these things.The TMC won this AC with a lead of 15,612 votes over the BJP in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. In 2016, the BJP was practically non-existent in Bolpur.The BJP organisation, while it has expanded significantly, is still no match for the TMC. Birbhum is Anubrata Mandal’s area, who is perhaps the TMC’s biggest strongman in the state. A large part of the BJP cadre base is also a persecuted lot. Many have faced TMC violence, have police cases slapped against them and continue to face risk of more violence.The story of BJP’s organisational growth in Bolpur is not very different from the kind of people the ISF has been able to draw in Muslim-dominated pockets. The image of being rebels against the ruling party, while it increases their physical vulnerability, also grants them a political appeal and sympathy at the local level.The grassroot cadre of the BJP comprises of many former CPI(M) workers who saw in the BJP the ability, and more importantly, willingness to take on the wrath of the TMC. It is hardly surprising that many of the BJP’s slogans in these elections, such as Lorche Kara? BJP! (Who is fighting? BJP!), are a modified version of what used to be very popular in the CPI(M) ranks.That senior BJP leaders, including Cabinet ministers, visit their activists who have faced violence on a regular basis has helped create this perception. This is something the CPI(M) leadership, both at the national and state level, failed to do effectively after it lost power in 2011. The decisive moment on this count came in the 2018 panchayat elections. The TMC unleashed unprecedented repression and the BJP emerged as the main opposition force in the state by providing biggest resistance on the ground.This is not to say that the BJP has not deployed violence where it can, but their ability to do so is still far lower than the TMC. Resources, both material and human, which the BJP can afford to deploy even from outside West Bengal, have obviously helped. Important TMC defectors, such as Suvendu Adhikari, are also most useful on this count.While the BJP is seen as the dominant party in rest of the country, in West Bengal it is still as a bunch of rebels who have dared to take on the local strongmen of the TMC. The glue which binds its nascent organisation on the ground is not effective organisers or leaders, but the belief that the BJP is the most effective weapon in the fight against the TMC.While it is premature, the BJP’s organisational problems will be far greater if it does capture power in the state than what they are now. Many BJP workers including local level leaders and activists HT spoke to, articulated this concern. While they acknowledge the utility of TMC turncoats in the ongoing electoral battle, they are also apprehensive about the “non-ideological” lot garnering a greater share of the pie if the party were to win.Two narratives in West Bengal: Assertion of invincibility versus “we are almost there”While it is hazardous to predict electoral outcomes, this author, during his election reporting trips, has seen the BJP gain continuous momentum in West Bengal between the 2018 panchayat elections and the 2021 assembly elections. In 2018, the BJP settled the contest for the main opposition party by winning far more panchayat seats than the CPI(M). In 2019, it was strong enough to challenge the TMC directly and inflict a heavy damage on it. The BJP’s campaign rhetoric of winning West Bengal in 2021 draws a lot of credibility from its ability to deliver on its 2018 and 2019 claims.The TMC, on the other hand, is largely banking on an assertion of invincibility. Most TMC activists, HT spoke to, admit that the seat tally will come down from what it was in 2016 and even though prospects in their specific constituency look slightly difficult, the TMC would manage to retain power somehow.This is in a way comparable to the situation in 2011 when the TMC had significantly improved its performance in the 2008 panchayat and 2009 Lok Sabha elections and the CPI(M) was banking on its unbeaten track record of 34 years.Post script The CPI(M): new wine in an old bottle The CPI(M), which ruled West Bengal from 1977 to 2011, lost the status of the main opposition party in the state in 2016. In the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, not only did it fail to win a Lok Sabha seat, it also did not have a lead in any of the 294 ACs. In the 26 ACs which it won in 2016, the CPI(M) was relegated to the third position in 18 ACs. In seven out of these, its vote share was less than 10%.CPI(M) offices from Kolkata to districts headquarters to small towns bear a deserted look in these elections. However, what seem to be enthusing left supporters in the state is a new crop of young leaders. These include people like Minakshi Mukherjee, who was fielded in the Nandigram, and Aishe Ghosh, a candidate in Jamuria AC in Asansol. Ghosh grabbed national limelight as the Jawaharlal Nehru Students’ Union President (JNUSU) when she was attacked by alleged ABVP supporters in JNU. Mukherjee has been getting a lot of praise for her campaign speeches.While the incumbent MLA in Jamuria is from the CPI(M), its AC-wise vote share plummeted to just 9.5% in the 2019 elections. HT accompanied Ghosh on one of her campaign rounds and people recognise her as the young woman who faced violence and appreciate the fact that the party has put up a fresh face. Some of them might vote for the CPI(M) even though they voted for the BJP in the 2019 elections. Any shot at victory, however, will require a large-scale shift in an election where everyone sees the TMC and the BJP as the main players.While the younger candidates are drawing appreciation, large sections within and outside the party are critical of the alliance with ISF, which draws its main appeal from religion. There is also significant amount of despair over the political irrelevance of the left in the state. Common voters, however, do not have any sympathy for the older CPI(M) activists who enjoyed and wielded state power until 2011.In an election, where the BJP is trying to push communal polarisation, it is suicidal for the left to have embraced a force like the ISF, a senior party leader in Bardwan district, once considered the stronghold of the CPI(M), said.Others see this as an act of compulsion for the party to stay electorally relevant. “I cast my first vote in 2009, and I have not got an opportunity to walk in a victory procession till today. The party needs to do all it can to win”, Aniruddha Dhar, a young CPI(M) activist told HT not very far from the state headquarters of the party in Kolkata.The CPI(M) leadership championed the idea of an alliance with the Congress in 2016 on precisely these lines; the promise of an improvement in electoral performance. The experiment ended up in the CPI(M) losing the status of major opposition party to the Congress. Some political observers, including people within the party, believe that the ISF might end up getting more seats than the CPI(M) this time.The alliance with the ISF is only the latest addition to the list of CPI(M)’s historic blunders in the state.Kapil Krishna Thakur, a Dalit writer, is the CPI candidate from Gaighata AC in Bangaon district, which is reserved for Scheduled Caste candidates. The BJP had a lead of 35,948 votes over the TMC in this AC in 2019. The left lost this AC in the 2001 Lok Sabha election itself.The Namashudra community, most of which associates with the Matua sect, first shifted towards the TMC in large numbers and is now mobilised behind the BJP.It was Kanti Biswas, a Namashudra CPI(M) leader, who first won Gaighata for the left. It was an unreserved AC back then. Biswas was named the education minister in the second Left Front government which was formed in 1982. Biswas recounted in his memoirs, Brahmin teachers and headmasters writing to Pramod Das Gupta, the then party secretary, asking that a chandal (low caste) not be given the education ministry, even though he could be given bigger responsibilities in the government. While PDG, as Dasgupta was popularly known, refused to accept such demands, the later generations of the CPI(M) leadership failed to realise the importance of what their own party had done.In a 2013 interview, Sitaram Yechury, the current general secretary of the CPI(M) had to say the following about Biswas. “Kanti Biswas was the education minister for many years in West Bengal. I had no idea he was Dalit. We used to travel all across the country in the same coupe. I did not know he was Dalit till Kanshi Ram asked this. The point was these things were never part of our consciousness..Unfortunately, instead of raising the country’s level to mine, where I, a Brahmin, did not even know I am in the same carriage as a Dalit, we had to stoop down to the Kanshi Ram level. We are doing it now”, he added.Recognising caste as a reality might have come too late for the CPI(M) in West Bengal as the marginalised communities first shifted towards the TMC and are now gravitating towards the BJP. With the Hindu SC-ST groups solidly lining up behind the BJP and the Muslims embracing the ISF as a viable option against the TMC, especially if it were to lose power, any left resistance to the BJP in West Bengal would find it very difficult to include the have-nots in the future.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/west-bengal-2021-where-the-national-hegemon-is-a-local-rebel-101618295020691.html
14-04-2021||Noida||Noida reports highest single day spike of 483 cases, to increase bed strength to 4,000||NOIDA: Gautam Budh Nagar recorded 483 new Covid-19 cases on Wednesday, the highest spike in a single day ever since the outbreak of the viral infection in March last year, according to the state’s daily health bulletin. With this, the overall tally of the district has mounted to 28,439 cases, including 2,027 active cases. The previous highest for the district was 327 cases reported on July 18 last year, officials said. To deal with the sudden spike in positive cases this month, the district administration has decided to increase the number of Covid beds in different hospitals from around 2,500 to about 4,000, the officials said. On Tuesday, the district had reported four deaths due to Covid-19, taking the district’s toll to 97, the health bulletin showed.  In a meeting with heads of different cells of the integrated Covid-19 command centre in sector 59, GB Nagar district magistrate Suhas LY said that it is the need of the hour to increase the number of dedicated beds to 4,000 in different hospitals. “At present, the district has around 2,500 dedicated Covid-19 beds, including 528 intensive care unit (ICU) beds, in different facilities. But keeping in mind that as many as 2,339 cases have been detected in first 14 days of April, it is needed to have additional beds ready in the hospitals,” he said. While Sharda hospital has been asked to increase its capacity to 720 from 380 beds, the Government Institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS) will now have 300 beds (earlier 200). Similarly, Noida Institute of Medical Sciences (NIMS) has been asked to increase its capacity to 300 from 200 beds and Jaypee hospital from 40 to 240, the DM said.The district at present has 10 Covid-dedicated hospitals, which include eight private facilities, the officials said.Suhas further said that the rise in active cases has badly affected the vaccination, testing and contact tracing activities in the district. He said that the hospitals have also shown their keen interest in developing exclusive facilities for the treatment of Covid-19 patients. “All the private and government hospitals have been asked to ensure that all patients must be treated without any delay. The standard protocol for Covid-19 will be followed at every step by all these hospitals,” he said. Replying to a query on patients coming from other districts, the DM said that since it’s a matter of lives of the patients, they can’t be denied treatment. “But, we are planning to issue directions for other hospitals in neighbouring districts to first co-ordinate with the Covid-dedicated facilities here regarding the availability of beds, before referring their patients,” he said. Echoing similar views, Dr Deepak Ohri, chief medical officer (CMO), said that the private Covid-19 facilities have been categorically asked to admit the referred patients from other districts, only if they are having adequate beds. “The health department officials have been asked to take stock of patients from other districts being treated in GB Nagar hospitals,” he said. When contacted, Dr NK Sharma, president of Noida chapter of Indian Medical Association (IMA), said that since the new strain of infection is more lethal, the district administration must notify smaller clinics and hospitals as Covid-dedicated facilities. “Since there is an apparent rush for the beds in government hospitals and people belonging to lower income groups can’t afford their treatment in corporate hospitals, it is always feasible to notify smaller private hospitals and clinics for the treatment of Covid-19 patients,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-reports-highest-single-day-spike-of-483-cases-to-increase-bed-strength-to-4000-101618424872596.html

The employees also resisted us and so, we decided to register a complaint with the police after which the local councillors intervened and the bakery management agreed to remove the encroachments,” he said.Yogendra Kumar Sharma, manager, Harish Bakery, said that the incident happened due to miscommunication as the enforcement team started action without any prior information. “We have assured the authorities that we will work only inside our premises. A water cooler was installed outside and all other activities have been curtailed,” said Sharma.The enforcement officials said that they have decided to conduct regular anti-encroachment drives on Old Railway Road and other prominent roads in this part of the city as residents have been regularly complaining about encroachments on roads.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/dtcp-to-issue-notices-for-building-violations-in-sushant-lok1-101618423852498.html

Data of US citizens, one laptop, one hard disk and ₹1.90 lakh were recovered from their possession. The police said that at least 2,000 people based in the US were targeted.A case was registered on Wednesday at Cyber police station under sections 420 (cheating), 120B (conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code and sections 66D and 75 of the IT Act.The suspects were identified as Akshay Dalal (32) of Madhya Pradesh, the kingpin, who lived in a society on Sohna Road, while the others were Naganginaliy Hangal (27), Siminlal Tuthang (28), Skuyuravasi (26), Vikato Achoomi (24), Imlong (26) and Mangacha Baithe (30), who belong to Nagaland and Manipur, said police.They were produced before the district and sessions court on Wednesday and lodged in judicial custody.Inderjeet Yadav, deputy superintendent of police, crime investigation department (CID), said that they received a tip-off late Monday. “The kingpin, Dalal, had taken up an office on rent in Ansal Corporate Plaza on the first floor and was paying ₹65,000 a month. The call centre was operational since January this year. These suspects were duping US nationals and were taking money through gift cards and Pay Pal,” he said.Harish Budhiraja, inspector, chief minister’s flying squad, said that they conducted a reconnaissance of the area on Tuesday. “There were six men and three women making calls in the room. They all were graduates who had work experience at other call centres. There were around 15 workstations and training was given to the employees before hitting the floor. They also set up a toll-free number, to which they received calls from their targets,” he said.The police said the suspects had developed several fake websites, which would direct the victims to call the toll-free number for assistance. The police estimate that they made over ₹2 crore in the last three months as the workers were paid ₹15,000 to ₹25,000 per month.The police said the confiscated hardware will be sent to a laboratory in Madhuban, Karnal, for forensic examination. “Payment was generally done through virtual gateways, credit and debit cards, gift cards, iTunes cards,” said Yadav, adding that the call centre used to earn nearly ₹3 lakh a day.The police said the exact number of victims and the amount of money siphoned may be higher than anticipated. “We are also getting a forensic audit of the seized property,” Yadav said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/illegal-call-centre-busted-seven-arrested-101618423733353.html

Hence, we have floated a tender for repairing the road surface of the ROB. We are aiming to start work on the infrastructure from next month,” said Jitender Mittal, chief engineer, GMDA.The ROB was constructed in May 2017 and less than a year after it opened, the surface started developing cracks. In January 2019, a retaining wall of the ROB collapsed, leading to one carriageway being closed for nearly two months. At present, there is heavy silt deposition to the leftmost and rightmost lanes of each carriageway. The approach road, especially from the Dwarka Expressway, remains heavily potholed.According to GMDA officials, the entire repair work is expected to cost around ₹31 lakh, and the contractor will have a maximum of three months to complete the work. “The entire road surface will be repaired and since it primarily involves bitumen related work, the aim is to complete it before mid-June, prior to the beginning of monsoon. Once the road is repaired, the contractor will also paint thermoplastic road markings, to help drivers with lane driving in the dark,” a senior GMDA official privy to the matter said.Officials said they might close the entire carriageway for a maximum of two-three days only if the need arises.Before the ROB’s construction, commuters travelled through Basai-Dhankot Road towards Pataudi Chowk and took a right turn to head towards Dwarka Expressway, a route that was nearly five kilometres longer.“For safety reasons, the repairing of ROB is crucial and an urgent requirement. GMDA, however, needs to ensure that the carriageways are only partially closed and continue to remain accessible to motorists even in a limited capacity. Otherwise, the entire diverted route is extremely long and will further clog the already severely congested Pataudi Chowk. It will result in commuters taking 30-40 minutes extra time to reach their destination during peak traffic hours,” said Yashesh Yadav, president, Dwarka Expressway (DXP) Welfare Association.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gmda-to-repair-basai-rail-overbridge-before-monsoon-101618423732491.html

All permitted establishments and industries are further directed to get their passes issued within next seven days.”The state government ordered a night curfew in the state on Monday, with restrictions on public movement between 10pm and 5am, to curb the spread of Covid-19 infections.JN Mangla, president, Gurgaon Industrial Association, said that although the government has asked the industry to register with the Saral Haryana portal, they have asked the district administration to consider identity cards as passes. “It will be difficult to secure passes for each worker. So, it would be easier if the identity cards are considered for movement,” said Mangla.Large industries in Manesar, on the other hand, said that they have tweaked their shift timings to ensure that workers in the evening shift reach home by 10pm, while those working the night shift reach the premises before 9pm. “It is difficult to get passes and seek permissions. Most of us have, instead, changed shift timings. The authorities should have discussed the matter with industry and given few days before imposing night curfew,” said Manmohan Gaind, a factory owner and the vice-president of the Manesar Industries Welfare Association.Under the exemptions, the government has allowed the movement of passengers from airports, railway stations and interstate bus terminals (ISBTs) during curfew hours.Also, personnel of police and paramilitary engaged in maintaining law and order, and those engaged in municipal, health, electricity and other essential services are exempted from restrictions. There shall also be no curbs on manufacture and movement of essential goods, as well as on the interstate and intrastate movement of non-essential goods, the order stated.There are also no curbs on the movement of healthcare and medical staff of private and government establishments, as well on the operation of hospitals, clinics and pharma shops, as per the order.Among other services to be exempted from the curbs were telecom, IT and ITes sectors, delivery of essentials such as food, pharmaceutical and similar items, operation of petrol pumps, and power generation and distribution services.The government also directed the deputy commissioners to appoint incident commanders to enforce these guidelines in their respective jurisdictions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/factory-owners-directed-to-seek-passes-for-movement-of-workers-101618423680614.html

There is no plan for a lockdown,” he said.Referring to a recent meeting chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi with chief ministers, Chautala said that directions were clear that the focus was on curbing infection and not a lockdown. “Under the night curfew, there are no restraints on economic activities but only the movement of people has been curbed to break the chain of Covid-19,” he said.Last week, chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar also said that there would not be a lockdown in Haryana. He also discounted the possibility of a night curfew. However, the government announced one three days later, with restrictions on non-essential movement between 10pm and 5am.When asked about the reverse migration of workers due to fear of the lockdown, the deputy CM said that there were no reports that workers were going home. He said that during last year’s lockdown, Haryana was the only state where the industry was able to operate even with severe restrictions. Chautala said that permission for workers in industries will be granted, in case it is required.He also said that because of rising Covid-19 infections among farmers, he will suggest the Prime Minister involves senior leaders in discussions and resolve the issues raised by farmers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/no-lockdown-plans-curfew-only-to-break-virus-chain-chautala-101618423680004.html

Eleven labour enforcement officers (grade 1) have used forged experience certificates to get the job, the department suspects. An official, familiar with the probe said, “The probe was initiated after a Ludhiana resident, Harsimran Saini, filled a detailed affidavit in the Punjab and Haryana high court, alleging that most of these officials had forged experience certificates to complete the minimum qualification for the job. Saini had not been appointed. The department has to file its reply in the high court.” Saini had collected all information through a Right to Information (RTI) Act. The department has directed its deputy directors (factories) to conduct a probe into experience certificates of labour enforcement officers deployed at these districts and send a report. A copy of the order is with HT. According to Saini, some of these labour enforcement officers had submitted experience certificates of those institutions or factories, which were not operational, did not even exist and were not registered under the Factory Act and the Punjab Shops and Commercial Establishment Act. Some experience certificates did not have signatures of authorised signatories. Besides, dates and designation of experience certificates and offer letters do not match. Saini has claimed that these officers filed experience certificates of sales executives and accountant managers, which were irrelevant to labour laws. The state government had sought a minimum two-year experience of practical working of labour laws of government or private undertaking. “The lawfully laid down procedure for verification of experience certificates of the selected candidates was not followed,” his affidavit says. A labour commissioner letter from August 7, 1996, says, that there should be verification of experience certificates by labour inspectors by verifying relevant records. Physical verification of institutions is needed. Principal secretary, labour, VK Janjua, did not respond to repeated calls. Pawan Kumar Thind, labour commissioner, Punjab, said he was on leave. Officiating labour commissioner, DPS Kharbanda said, “Appropriate action will be taken as per the law.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/labour-dept-probing-appointment-of-11-enforcement-officers-in-2017-101618423679513.html

Joint teams of police, vigilance wing of the state food department and mandi board are keeping watch on 200 roller mills, flour mills and private godowns to stop them from bringing wheat from other states, especially during procurement. “We get cheaper wheat from states outside Punjab and stock keeps coming in throughout the year, because we cannot store in huge quantity. Now, our stocks are stuck at inter-state borders. My request to the government is to release our stocks, which have been held at borders. Otherwise, we would incur losses,” said Naresh Ghai, president, an association of roller flour mills. Privately-run flour mills process at least 12 lakh tonne of wheat a year.“We have asked them (traders) to bring their raw material (wheat) after procurement gets over in Punjab by the middle of May,” said an officer of the state food department, adding that there were unconfirmed reports that wheat stock bought from outside, at lower cost, is mixed with freshly harvested wheat for more profit. These stocks from outside the state are purchased between ₹1,500 and ₹1,600 a quintal, and get sold in Punjab at a minimum support price (MSP) of ₹1,975 a quintal, earning profit of over ₹300 a quintal. The officer adds the practise of bringing wheat and paddy stocks from outside states started a few years ago, especially when the MSP witnessed a sharp rise. In states other than Punjab and Haryana, foodgrain is procured from the local farmer at a cheaper price. Last week, the food department seized huge stock of wheat from three godowns in Bathinda, Ferozpur and Barnala registered forgery cases against the owners of the godowns. This was after they could not give a convincing reason for the presence of 37,000 bags of wheat from other states in their godowns. Traders buy wheat stock from Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan. Surveillance teams have increased checks on inter-state border. According to assistant director general of police (ADGP) for provisioning Naresh Arora, joint teams are stationed at entry points from other states. There are a large number of private godowns, where movement of wheat stocks is monitored regularly. “We don’t have the exact number of such godowns. There are a large number of traders in the state, who keep personal stocks. We are verifying stocks in these godowns also,” added an officer in food department. Rakesh Singla, deputy director, Punjab food department who heads the vigilance wing, said checks were on across the state. Principal secretary, food and civil supplies, has written to all district chiefs in his department to check transportation of wheat stock. 5.12 lakh tonne wheat procured on Day 5 Government agencies on Wednesday procured 5.12 lakh tonne of wheat in the state on the fifth day of procurement. A spokesperson said Pungrain procured around 1.35 lakh tonne, Markfed; 1.18 lakh tonne; Punsup 1.32 tonne and Punjab State Warehousing Corporation 70,873 tonne. The central agency, FCI has procured 19,913 tonne of wheat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/joint-teams-on-job-to-overcome-wheat-smuggling-challenge-101618423253883.html

14-04-2021||Mumbai||Hard to list static essentials, allow delivery of all items: Amazon tells Maharashtra govt||E-commerce major Amazon on Wednesday urged the Maharashtra government to allow deliveries of all products to customers amid new restrictions to curb coronavirus infections, saying it was challenging to define a static essentials list.Currently, it is enabling deliveries of only essential products in Maharashtra in line with the new guidelines set by the state government."Customers trust Amazon.in to safely deliver all products according to their respective needs. Currently, we are enabling deliveries of essential products in the state of Maharashtra in line with new guidelines set by the government," an Amazon India spokesperson said.The spokesperson added that learning from the last year showed that urgent customer needs vary across households and it is challenging to define a static essentials list."...therefore we request the government to allow delivery of all products as soon as possible. E-commerce is the safest way to serve consumers' needs while supporting livelihoods of lakhs of small & medium businesses including the local shops,” the spokesperson said.According to a senior industry executive, industry representatives have approached the Maharashtra government, Home Ministry and DPIIT to request that allow delivery of all items via e-commerce in the state."Our delivery in Maharashtra will be restricted to essentials, as mandated by the government. However, users will be able to order from the entire catalogue and delivery of non-essentials will happen when that is permitted," a Snapdeal spokesperson said.The spokesperson expressed hope that the government - as part of its dynamic review of the situation - will consider allowing e-commerce companies to cater to the complete range of user requirements."Enabling users to shop from the safety of their homes is a crucial advantage that e-commerce offers. It also helps reduce the impact of economic disruption on lakhs of online sellers and those associated with such businesses," the spokesperson elaborated.According to the health ministry data, till 8 am on Wednesday, Maharashtra had 5,94,585 active cases, up 28,307 from the previous day.Industry estimates suggest that Maharashtra makes a double-digit contribution to e-commerce sales in the country and is a major market, along with geographies like Delhi-NCR and Karnataka.As per reports, other platforms like Flipkart and JioMart have also stopped taking orders for non-essential items from customers in the state.Flipkart did not respond to queries.Lockdowns are not a new phenomenon for e-commerce companies in the country. Last year in March, as the pandemic broke out, a nationwide lockdown was imposed that brought transportation of goods and movement of personnel to a grinding halt.However, the e-commerce sector has also been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the pandemic, as containment measures introduced millions to the convenience of online shopping, and prompted seasoned online shoppers to buy more.There were initial hiccups and e-commerce companies struggled to complete deliveries even as orders pile up. During the first two phases of the lockdown, e-commerce companies were allowed to sell only essential items like grocery, healthcare and pharmaceutical products. In the following phases (starting May 4), the restrictions were gradually lifted.With the second wave of COVID cases now touching record highs, states may look at enforcing stricter guidelines around the movement to control the spread. E-commerce players will bank on last year's experience to manage the situation better this time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/hard-to-list-static-essentials-allow-delivery-of-all-items-amazon-101618420124730.html
14-04-2021||Pune||Small hospitals in Pune struggle to make ends meet||PUNE As major hospitals in Pune struggle to cope with rising Covid cases, citizens resort to smaller hospitals. In some cases, these hospitals are unable to provide proper treatment to patients. In two such incidents, it was found that while these smaller hospitals admitted patients who had severe Covid symptoms, but allegedly failed to provide proper treatment.Sana Hospital located in Kondhwa, came under heavy fire on social media after a video made by the deceased patient’s father went viral. In the video, the father of Atikh Sayed, Abdul Sayyed alleged that the hospital made him buy expensive medicines costing ₹14,000 daily for almost a week. The video spread on social media and the hospital had to face violent threats from relatives of patients.Dr Suhel Khan who runs the hospital said, “We have treated over 800 OPD patients of Covid who were in home isolation and above 180 in patients in our hospitals since the last wave and we have a recovery rate of over 90 per cent. After a patient does not get a bed in any of the major hospitals they come to us and we try to accommodate them. In smaller hospitals, the relatives have access to the doctor and so they try to get violent sometimes. In this particular case, I filed a complaint with the local police to provide us protection.”In another case, a senior citizen was forced to be admitted at Welfare Hospital where the relative who himself was Covid positive had to cater to the patient’s needs as the entire family was quarantined. The relative requesting anonymity said, “My mother is a diabetic and she did not get breakfast in the hospital. I had to get it from outside. she did not even get hot water to drink. We got admitted late last night and throughout the night there were no doctors available to start the treatment.”In response to the allegations Dr Sadik Khan, who is one of the medical directors, said, “We have an extreme shortage of manpower. We do not have catering facilities at our hospital and we ask the relatives to get food for the patient. In some cases, we have certain locals who provide tiffin services if needed. At smaller hospitals, the issue is that there is no space to provide isolation between relatives and patients.”Dr Sanjay Patil, hospital board chairperson, Pune, Indian Medical Association (IMA), said, “Most of the smaller hospitals are run by single doctors or by couple doctors. They have to single-handedly manage oxygen supply, medicines and do clerical work for medical insurance. The doctors also have to simultaneously manage OPD and hospitalised patients too. Since they have limited beds, they do not have any step-down or step-up facility wherein they have reserve beds to transfer a patient from ICU to oxygen bed or oxygen to ICU beds. Catering and manpower are crucial issues in these hospitals which is not the case with major hospitals.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/small-hospitals-in-pune-struggle-to-make-ends-meet-101618419652193.html

14-04-2021||Patna||Covid-19: DRDO team visits to reactivate Bihta facility||A two-member team from the Defence Research Development Organisation (DRDO) was here on Wednesday to assess the state’s preparedness to fully operationalise the Employees State Insurance (ESI) hospital at Bihta in Patna for treatment of Covid-19 patients, as Bihar reported 21 deaths with 4,786 new cases — the highest in a single day so far. Patna accounted for 1,483 cases and four deaths. Among those infected were three senior IAS officers, including an officer in the rank of chief secretary, other of the home department and an IPS officer. A minister in the Nitish Kumar cabinet had also tested positive. Several senior officers in the home department, public health and engineering department, finance and the Information and Public Relations Department had also gone in home isolation. A senior officer of the home department was admitted to the AIIMS-Patna on Wednesday. The DRDO team has agreed to extend help to the state government by providing 50 doctors to fully operationalise the 500-bed ESI hospital, said top sources in the state health department. The Bihar government had on Tuesday sought assistance from the army in providing doctors to fully operationalise the ESI hospital. In a letter to defence secretary, Bihar’s principal secretary Pratyaya Amrit requested the defence secretary to send 50 doctors from the Armed Forces Medical Corps (AFMC) so that the ESI hospital could be utilised properly. “We will depute requisite number of nurses and other para-medical staff and have requested the defence ministry to send 50 doctors from the armed forces so that the 500-bed hospital can be utilised properly like last year,” said Amrit. “Presently, the facilities exist but in light of the surge in Covid-19 cases in Bihar, particularly in Patna, it is of urgent necessity to utilise the existing facilities of ESI hospital, Bihta. At present, we are using only 50 beds in this hospital with the services of a few doctors and other support from the state government,” Amrit added. Executive director, State Health Society, Manoj Kumar, said, “We will work on a warfooting to operationalsie the facility after a team from the DRDO visited Bihta today and later held discussions with our principal secretary.” The 500-bed Covid care facility at ESI Bihta was set up last year under the PM Care Fund. Meanwhile, the Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (IGIMS) will operationalise 100 IU beds for Covid-19 patients on Thursday, said Kumar. The Patna district administration had on Wednesday earmarked 14 more private hospitals in Patna for treatment of Covid-19 patients, increasing the bed strength by 199, said Patna district magistrate Chandrashekhar Singh. With this altogether 47 private facilities, having cumulative 985 beds, had been identified in the district for treatment of Covid-19 cases, he added. The health department was also keeping tabs on oxygen generation plants in the state to ensure there was no hoarding or blackmarketing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/covid19drdoteam-visits-to-reactivate-bihta-facility-101618419532710.html

The PM and the Vice President underlined the need for Governors to take initiatives at their level to increase people participation to create a mass movement against the pandemic. They urged the Governors to include universities under them as well as Red Cross and other voluntary organisations for the purpose, said an official of the Raj Bhawan.

Bihar governor Phagu Chouhan later told his principal secretary Rober L CHongthu to make preparations for the April 17 all-party meeting. “All the suggestions and feedbacks received at the meeting will be worked upon, while the state government is already taking necessary steps to contain pandemic,” the official quoting Governor said. The Governor is also likely to interact with vice chancellors soon to involve the universities in creating awareness about vaccination and Covid-appropriate behaviour in their respective jurisdictions to contain the surge in Covid-19 cases in the last couple of weeks in Bihar, especially since Holi. Last week, chief minister Nitish Kumar had said that the government would soon contact the Governor to request him to call an all-party meeting, as suggest by Prime Minister Narendra Modi during an interaction with chief ministers. During an interaction with chief ministers on March 8, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had asked the CMs to make the ‘maximum use’ of the office of the Governor to put up a united fight against the pandemic.

14-04-2021||Other||Converting big medical instts into Covid centres solution to bed crisis, suggest Lucknow docs||LUCKNOW There is a doable solution to the bed crisis being faced by Covid patients in the city – convert big medical institutions into dedicated Covid centres instead of having small and scattered Covid facilities at different places. A centralised system can also take the bed strength beyond 10,000 in Lucknow, suggest doctors. “The number of Covid beds can be increased manifold, if institutions like KGMU, RMLIMS, SGPGI and big ones in the private sector are made dedicated Covid centres. Right from isolation, to high dependency (HDU) and ICU beds, the shortage can be reduced considerably,” said Dr Vaibhav Khanna, director, Healthcity hospital. At the moment, Lucknow has 31,687 active cases and there are some 3,000 beds for Covid patients in 32 hospitals. In the past three days, 13,718 new cases have been added to Lucknow’s Covid tally. Majority of these patients remain in home isolation, but many need hospitalisation with oxygen/ventilator support. Doctors said the need of the hour is to make big hubs for level 1, level 2 and level 3 Covid facilities, instead of a scattered system contributing a handful of beds at different places. The KGMU has about 5,000 beds (333 for Covid patients at the moment). Doctors said the emergency (trauma), gynaecology and cardiology, along with some other necessary wings can be left out and the remaining beds on the campus can be allotted for Covid patients. In case, the KGMU becomes a dedicated Covid facility, emergency services at trauma centre can still run along with gynaecology and cardiology wings as these facilities are in buildings on the roadside, while Covid facilities can come up in Shatabdi Hospital, Gandhi Memorial and the Associated Hospital wing. KGMU V-C Lt Gen Dr Bipin Puri said, “We are planning expansion of Covid facilities.” Similarly, Lohia institute that runs over 250 Covid beds has the entire hospital block for expanding Covid facility. “With OPD closed and only emergency operations being done, the occupancy in wards has come down,” said a senior faculty at the KGMU. “A patient’s search for a bed goes on for hours from one hospital to another… but if major campuses are made Covid centres, the search can be completed in minutes and patient can be shifted in an hour only,” said Dr PK Gupta, former president, Indian Medical Association, Lucknow. “Delay in admission, health complexities and fatality have a direct connect. Hence, if admission is smooth and fast, mortality rate among Covid cases will come down,” said Dr Abhishek Shukla, secretary general, Association of International Doctors. The Covid Command Centre usually takes over two hours to get bed availability cross-checked and allot the same to a Covid patient while the process of allotting ambulance and shifting takes another four hours. And with the rise in cases, several patients have to wait for over a day before they are shifted, said attendants of Covid patients. “Medical colleges have liquid oxygen and their ICUs have ventilators with trained staff. If such campuses are made Covid centres, we can also get speedy recovery with speedy admissions,” said Dr Khanna. “An option should also be given to big private hospitals to run as dedicated covid centres. Not 20 or 70 beds, but the entire hospital as a Covid centre so that the private sector too is fully involved,” said Dr Gupta. WHY THESE COLLEGES? “The KGMU has separate buildings with proper ventilation. Besides, operating theatres (OTs) here can be dedicated for Covid care as routine operations have been cancelled. The idea is to increase beds in equipped campuses where staff is trained and not where standards are not as per the national medical commission norms,” said Dr Khanna. Apart from the KGMU, Dr Ram Manohar Lohia Institute of Medical Sciences with over 1,000 (200 beds for Covid patients at the moment), SGPGI with 3,500 beds (250 Covid beds currently), Homeopathy College in Gomti Nagar and Ayurveda College in Tudiyaganj can help increase bed strength to over 10,000, said health experts. “While KGMU, SGPGI, RMLIMS can be made Level 3 hospitals, Homeopathy and Ayurved colleges can be Level 2 hospitals,” said Dr Khanna. WHAT ABOUT STAFF CRISIS? Asked if big Covid centres face staff crisis in case health workers test positive in large numbers, doctors said in such a case reserve staff can be deployed from nearby government or even private hospitals. “Ten nursing/paramedical staff from private hospitals should be kept in reserve and called on 24-hour notice to big Covid centes. This will give cushion to medical colleges (that run as Covid centres) in case of staff crisis,” he added. BOX How making a dedicated unit helps Era’s Medical College, which had 220 beds, was declared as a dedicated Covid facility and now has 300 beds. The bed strength would be raised to 500 shortly. The hospital administration has been asked by the state government to enhance bed strength up to 700. Similarly, Integral University as a dedicated Covid centre will have 400 beds and TS Mishra Medical College 500 beds. The rise in number of beds was announced after these institutions were declared as dedicated Covid centres. In the past 24 hours, 121 HDU/ICU beds have been added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/converting-big-medical-instts-into-covid-centres-solution-to-bed-crisis-suggest-lucknow-docs-101618416111778.html

Sufficient number of ICU beds should be made available in districts with high number of active Covid cases that include Lucknow, Prayagraj, Varanasi, Kanpur Nagar, Gorakhpur and Jhansi, added the CM. Yogi, who was in self-isolation after testing positive for Covid, was reviewing the Covid situation virtually with Team-11 members. He said uninterrupted supply of oxygen should be ensured in Covid hospitals and oxygen cylinders should be regularly replaced in all districts while dialysis machines should be arranged for Covid-19 patients suffering from kidney ailments. He said the chief minister’s office, chief secretary’s office, additional chief secretary (health) and principal secretary (medical education) should regularly monitor arrangements. The CM said the campaign to contain Covid should continue keeping ‘test, trace and treat’ in focus. “Arrangements for additional medical personnel and equipment should be made in private medical colleges being used as Covid hospitals,” emphasized Yogi. He said the state government had sent a special plane to Ahmedabad to get 25,000 Remdesivir injections for the treatment of Covid patients in UP. The medicine would reach the state by Wednesday evening. “Chief minister Yogi Adityanath has asked the health department to urgently get 25,000 Remdesivir injections from Ahmedabad. As per orders of CM, officers of health department are going to get Remdesivir injections by state government plane from Ahmedabad,” said a tweet from the chief minister’s office. He said testing capacity of laboratories of central institutes should be used and the number of RT-PCR tests be increased in the state. The use of TruNat machines should immediately begin for Covid tests and smooth supply of home isolation kits for Covid patients should be ensured in the state, added Yogi. He said regular communication should be maintained to know about the condition of patients in home isolation and appropriate guidance be given to them. Yogi Adityanath said the use of chief minister’s helpline 1076 should also be made for the purpose while integrated command and control centres should have information about the availability of beds and ambulance services. The CM said quarantine centres should be set up in every district keeping in view arrival of large number of migrants in UP from other states, adding that arrangements for screening, testing and food be made at these centres. “Provisions for containment zones should be strictly implemented. Covid help desks should be run effectively in all government, non-government offices and industrial establishments,” added Yogi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ensure-there-s-no-shortage-of-covid-beds-oxygen-yogi-tells-officials-101618415393381.html
14-04-2021||Pune||Long queues across Pune hours before 15-day lockdown||On Wednesday, hours before the 15-day restrictions kicked in, a large number of people could be seen waiting in queues for essential groceries outside supermarkets in Aundh, while those living in Ambedkar Vasahat and Indira Gandhi Nagar could be seen making a beeline for the whole sale stores in their area. People were willing to wait in queues as long as there were enough groceries to last for a month. “I want to take no chances even if the chief minister has announced 15 days of lockdown. Last year, we couldn’t get enough groceries to feed a family of six, hence this time I am not taking any chances and stocking up on essentials like oil, flours, rice,” said Minal Patil, who came as early as 7 am to D-Mart to buy her essentials. However, not everyone is lucky, and some are still not sure how will they make it through the 15-day curfew. Chandrakant Koli, owner of Jai Malhar auto garage is still not sure whether he should keep his shop open or not. He called one of his helpers back to work just a week ago. The helper, Chetan Koli who travelled from Karnataka is wondering if he should go back again. “I just came back a week ago and now with this announcement I haven’t really made enough money to send home, how will I go back? If I stay here, I will have to find a way to find food if there is no work,” said Chetan Koli. CM Uddhav Thackeray in a televised address on Tuesday night announced that his government will spend ₹5,400 crore to support people of the state during the 15-day long state-wide curfew, however most are waiting for officials to tell them where to get the free rations. At Kamgar Putla in Pune where most of the people work in the business of junk and scrap dealers are not aware of whether they are in the register to get the cash transfer scheme that the CM announced. The chief minister had announced a cash transfer scheme for registered construction workers, where ₹1,500 will be deposited in each bank account. “We work on construction sites, to pick up scrap and our wives help with brick and cement work, are we going to get the money?” asked Rajeev Manjrekar, a part-time construction worker. Rekha his wife was keen on knowing when the free rations of three kilogram of wheat and two kilogram of rice will be distributed. Kusum Bengade is a widow and works as a scrap collector said, “I can’t work anymore nor do I have any pension, how will I earn? I am happy to know that CM is giving us wheat and rice but that is not enough. We need oil, masalas, and other ingredients to survive, will someone be providing those too?” Mohammad Kasim who worked at a bag manufactured was caught sitting idle outside his home in Zuna Bazaar in Pune. “Ever since the announcement of lockdown, the owner of the bag manufacturer in the bazaar has shut shop and told us to go home and there is no payment as there is no business, so all this lockdown is doing is making the poor suffer. We had just begun work of stitching bags,” said Kasim. Sheikh Dawood also shut down his tailoring shop.“With people hardly earning any money, I haven’t got orders, and this is the month of Ramzan where people buy or stitch new clothes, but this year, is yet another setback.” Even the handicapped and senior citizens are wondering how to go about for these 15 days. Rekha Kale is handicapped and is taken care by her niece who works as a maid but with restrictions on work and getting tests done every 15 days seems to be an expensive thing.“We would rather wait for free rations and see how things go instead of trying to spend money on Covid-19 tests,” said Kale.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/long-queues-across-pune-hours-before-15-day-lockdown-101618415331696.html
14-04-2021||Pune||First day of Ramzan observed under the shadow of Covid restrictions||On Wednesday, Muslims observed the first day of the fast for Ramzan, it was also the day when the 15-day lockdown announced by the state government ushered in. In light of the restrictions imposed by Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, many Muslims chose to offer their prayers at home following an advisory from the Indian Muslims for Progress and Reforms (IMPAR). IMPAR has issued an advisory to the Muslim community for strict adherence to the safety precautions against the Covid -19 pandemic. Social distancing and wearing a mask are a must but there are other precautions that they must follow like following the night curfew, avoiding crowding during iftar ( breaking of fast ) time, avoiding use of loudspeakers during Sahri ( predawn meal).IMPAR also suggests offering prayers and Taraweeh Namaz in their respective homes instead of mosques. It specifies that people should avoid holding lavish iftar parties and instead help the poor and needy as Ramzan is the month of charity, they also list maintaining cleanliness, sanitation and harmonious atmosphere in the neighbourhood. Anjum Inamdar from the Mul Nivasi Muslim Manch said, “We have received the directives and usually on the first few days, people generally avoid going out, for it takes time to get used to the fasting. This year too, we are planning to celebrate Ramzan at home with family and follow all the regulations in place, for we want to help break the chain too and wish for Covid-19 to go away.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/first-day-of-ramzan-observed-under-the-shadow-of-covid-restrictions-101618415272228.html

Those who run these homes say maintaining social distance is impossible while dealing with special children. Some NGOs that are running shelter homes for special children, have also approached the women and child welfare department demanding exemption. “The city has many shelter homes. But ours is one that deals with special children. Maintaining social distance while handling special children is next to impossible,” said SS Dhapola, owner of Nirvan shelter home. Dhapola said the special children solely depended upon the staff for their daily chores, be it changing of clothes, feeding or any other day to day activity. “The government’s 50 per cent cut in staff order too is adding to our woes as in such a situation we cannot afford to reduce our staff, especially in times of pandemic,” Dhapola added. The situation is no different at Drishti—another shelter home dealing with special children. Officials here said that maintaining social distancing was an impossible task while caring for special children. But they said that in such a case, they were ensuring that 20 of their regular staff stayed at the shelter home itself, in order to avoid any contact with the outsiders. However, the women and child development department (WCD) that governs all the shelter homes is leaving no stone unturned in ensuring strict implementation of Covid 19 guidelines at the shelter homes in UP. As per the records with the district administration, the city has around 31 homes in the city, including observation homes and women shelter homes. “The number includes 8 government run shelter homes and 23 private ones. In all the homes there are around more than 90 employees,” an official said. Jai Pal Verma, who has the charge of the district probation officer (DPO) said they were strictly following WCD orders. “We have curtailed the staff, restricted entry of the outsiders, imposed restriction on routine inspections, made masks compulsory for the inmates and have made the roster for the regular staff,” said Verma. He said they were also conducting regular Covid check-ups of the shelter home staff and children. Last year, a Kanpur shelter home hogged the headline, with a Covid-19 positive employee reportedly passing on the infection to other 57 inmates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/covid-norms-with-special-kids-impossible-101618415271672.html

Medical experts opined that the number of tests fixed by the state government for the district was very small which should be increased to fight effectively with rising cases. The district witnessed 299 positive cases of Covid 19 and two deaths on Tuesday and in the past 12 days, 1580 people have tested positive. Six died during treatment. Medical experts insist on 3 T formula to contain the virus: Tests, Tracking and Treatment’. Dr Anil Nausran, a senior pathologist and former secretary of the Indian Medical Association ( IMA), Meerut unit, explained that testing, tracking and treatment should be done in a massive way to control the virus but unfortunately low number of tests were being carried out, so the actual condition of the pandemic could not be predicted and analysed. Dr Nausran claimed that private labs were charging very high fees for Covid tests and health officials had turned a deaf ear to the issue. “I have filed an RTI to enquire about the fees fixed for private labs for Covid tests but have not received any information yet”, said Dr Nausran who insisted on setting up sample collection centres at all primary and community health centres and at various private hospitals for RT PCR tests, instead of leaving it in the hands of a few private and government labs. District surveillance officer Dr Ashok Taliyan said that the health department had been given a target of conducting 3,500 Rapid Antigen and 2000 RT PCR tests in the district every day. He claimed to be conducting 6,000 to 7,000 tests daily, more than the target. Dr Taliyan said that they were following the guidelines of the central and state governments along with the orders of the high court. Medical experts believe that 5,500 daily tests for a population of over 34 lakhs won’t do much in breaking the chain of the virus, especially when the number of positive cases is on the rise every day. Dr Nausran questioned the methodology on the basis of which the state government fixed the number of tests to be conducted in a district. He said, “ A real situation of the medical emergency would come out only after conducting tests in large numbers”. The health department bulletin claims that 7,312 samples were tested on Tuesday and 299 were found positive. The department has so far sent 1111483 samples for testing so far since the onset of Covid in the district in March last year. This shows that on average, approximately 3,000 samples were tested every day for a population of over 34 lakh in the district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/number-of-daily-tests-in-meerut-insufficient-experts-101618415151621.html

The result for Class 10 will be prepared as per an objective criterion developed by the board. City-based students feel that the decision offers relief to Class 10 students, however, puts Class 12 students in a fix. Roshan Agarwal, a city-based Class 12 student said that the postponement of exams may affect the preparation for competitive exams. “There is a chance that the exams may clash with my competitive exams. Also, unlike Class 10, students have to keep revising for offline exams which divides their concentration. As the Covid cases are increasing, there is a very real possibility that the situation may not improve until May. This will cause more stress to 12th standard students,” said Agarwal. Samruddhi Joshi, a student of Class 12 said that the decision is welcomed, but it puts the Class 12 students under tremendous stress. “We have completed one whole year through online education which in itself was a challenge and now the exams are postponed, it has put a lot of stress on us. We have been studying for exams since the last few days. If the board exam was to get over, we would have finally got some time to relax and then start preparing for competitive exams,” said Joshi. She added that it is becoming stressful and uncertain what will happen when the exams are conducted. “I am trying to stay focused but like most of my classmates I am also much stressed. The exams should be cancelled rather than postponing. It is like testing our patience,” added Joshi. Neha Sharma, a student of Class 10 noted that she is happy with the decision of the board. “The decision is welcomed as students were under a lot of stress due to the Covid-19 situation. Also, the whole year has been a little difficult for us due to online classes but the decision to cancel final board exam is welcome,” said Sharma.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/cbserelief-for-class-10-stress-for-class-12-students-say-101618415152302.html

We did his preliminary check-up and X-ray at a local doctor. But the doctor said he will need an operation to put a rod in his broken leg. However, after seeing the rush at the government hospital, we decided to take him to another hospital. His operation was done at another private hospital. But the threat continued, what if I test positive for Covid,” said Gaikwad.She further added that due to the ongoing surge in Covid cases, her husband was sceptical of going to the hospital for treatment because of the fear of testing positive. “I have three daughters at home and I work as a house help. If I test positive, I put the lives of my family members at risk,” said Gaikwad.However, hospitals claim they are trying their best to segregate non-Covid patients and treat them on time.Abrarali Dalal, chief operating officer, Sahyadri Hospitals, said that with the number of Covid patients increasing in the last few weeks, there is a challenge to ensure that non- Covid patients do not suffer.“However, with our focus on prioritising critical admissions of non-Covid patients, proper segregation, stricter norms we have been able to deliver proper care especially where there is an emergency or where continuity of treatment is paramount. These include accident victims, heart patients, cancer patients amongst others,” said Dalal.Talking about planned surgeries, Dr Mahesh Lakhe, consultant - internal medicine and infectious diseases, Columbia Asia Hospital, Pune, said that due to a surge in the number of Covid patients in Pune, authorities have directed us to allocate more beds for such patients.“We are doing the rapid test to segregate Covid from non-Covid patients and prevent further spread of the disease. Emergency surgeries for non-Covid patients are going on as per schedule, but planned surgeries which can be done later have been postponed,” said Lakhe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/noncovid-patients-face-various-challenges-due-to-unavailability-of-beds-101618412091973.html

The city has reported multiple cases wherein people had to struggle to get a bed equipped with an oxygen supply. Roopesh Pitale, who struggled to get his father admitted, said, “My father’s oxygen level dropped on Tuesday. But we struggled to get a bed for him. Finally, after many hours a bed was arranged in Deenanath Mangeshkar Hospital and I admitted him there.”Hemant Chikhale, a resident of Kharadi shared a similar experience. “My friend’s father was in home isolation, but later due to breathlessness doctors advised us to get him admitted. Even after several hours, we couldn’t get him admitted. My friend had to make alternate arrangements.”Meanwhile, the daily covid report shared by the PMC also indicates that there has been an exponential increase in the number of patients on oxygen support in the last five days. On April 9, at least 4,662 patients were on oxygen support and 1,003 patients were critical. Whereas on April 13, at least 5,181 patients were on oxygen support and 1,086 were critical. So the number of patients who are on oxygen support has increased by 519.PMC officials claimed that they have been trying to increase the availability of oxygenated beds. “Every day we have been adding oxygen beds to the existing capacity. On Wednesday we made oxygen beds available in ESI hospitals. We will add more,” said Dr Manisha Naik, assistant medical officer, PMC. Dr Avinash Bhondave, immediate past president, (Maharashtra) Indian Medical Association, said, “Infection has been growing among comorbid and elderly patients and so the need for oxygen is growing.”“Some people ignore the early symptoms like mild cough, tiredness and take medicine without consulting doctors. They don’t even monitor oxygen level. When they feel severe breathlessness then they come to the doctors. If they consult doctors early then the infection could be managed without oxygen support,” he said.“Another reason is that some are getting CT scans without consulting doctors. When the CT score comes they pressurise doctors to admit them. Also, there is a flawed implementation of home isolation,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pune-city-likely-to-face-shortage-of-oxygen-beds-101618412091353.html

I knew it was important for her to get the jab. So when I was informed in advance about a hospital putting up a camp for vaccination, every week or 10 days, in our condo, I decided to take up a slot as it was nothing short of a blessing for us. They kept every patient under observation before going ahead.... and in a day, more than 100 people got vaccinated!”Many societies in Gurgram have been organising such vaccination drives in the condominiums. Many residents feel that these have eased their stress of planning to go afar to get the jab, and RWAs say they are trying to encourage more people to feel comfortable with the vaccination. Priti Anand, secretary, Westend Heights RWA, Gurugram, says, “People were really happy with the drive at their doorstep. The vaccination drive in our condo was conducted last Wednesday, and over 100 people, mostly in the age group of 45 to 60, got their first shot! We are very happy that half the condo has got one dose at least.”Anshu Bhatia, a resident of Sushant Estate, sector 52, Gurugram, is now looking forward to second such drive. “These drives are such a boon,” he says, adding, “One hospital’s team visited our community centre to vaccinate those above 45. It’s a big boon for senior citizens, as they are not comfortable going to the hospital. Some are scared too! But, when they see more people getting it done in their neighbourhood, they tend to get the courage to make up their mind and get themselves vaccinated. Now, I’m waiting for another two weeks to get my mom, who is a cancer patient, vaccinated with the second dose.” Some RWAs in Faridabad have also organised such vaccination drives, which have made RWAs in Delhi and Noida feel the need to emulate them. Rajiva Lochan Singh, president, Noida Federation of Apartment Owners Associations (NOFAA) hopes to have such drives at the societies in Noida. He says, “With the rise in Covid positive cases in Gautam Buddha Nagar, it has become important that people use masks all the time and get vaccinated at the earliest possible... And to scale up vaccination, we need to reach out to housing societies or high rises. Club houses or baraat ghar (wedding venue) infrastructure can be use for such vaccination camps in Noida as well. This would be quicker as all eligible family members can come in one go to get vaccinated.”“I am senior citizen and we did as a our duty. It is for our own safety. Our society compromises of more senior citizens and we have to take the best care as possible. We had Covid testing and the vaccination drive as well. The response has been good, and the first dose has been given to above 350. It has been very useful for everyone. Now my second dose is due,” says, an RWA member, from Westeng Heights, Gurugram.Author tweets @Nainaarora8Follow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/covid-vaccine-at-the-comfort-of-condos-ncr-residents-say-happy-to-ditch-hospital-visit-101618410713181.html

14-04-2021||Pune||Industries seek more clarity, exemptions on lockdown guidelines||After the state government allowed manufacturing units in the city that are needed by essential services to remain open during the 15-day lockdown, industrialists have sought keeping the units needed to fulfil export obligations functional. There is confusion among industrialists regarding which manufacturing units will be allowed during the 15-day lockdown announced by Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Tuesday night. In the meeting which was organised by Mahratta Chamber of Commerce, Industries and Agriculture (MCCIA), Sadashiv Survase, joint director of industries, Pune Region said, “Those units which were regarded as essential and permitted to operate in the first phase of lockdown shall continue to operate. However, these units need to take care to minimise the movement of employees in an effort to contain the spread of Covid-19 virus and should try to operate with minimum manpower.” He stated that the export-oriented units will be permitted to operate subject to the guidelines that need to be followed. The industries department will issue detailed guidelines later. “With 100 per cent supply reserved for medicinal use, few manufacturing units will remain non-functional,” added Survase. As per orders, all units that provide accommodation to the labours, working either in the same campus or in isolated facility from where movement may happen in an isolated bubble with only 10 per cent of managerial staff coming from outside may continue to work. Pune divisional commissioner Saurabh Rao said, “Following Covid appropriate behaviour by industrialists is a must. It should not be only on paper but to be followed promptly. Industries can hire a service of PMPML or private bus to bring employees to their premises.” Traders’ body unhappy Federation of Trade Association of Pune (FTAP) were unhappy with the new order as there was no relaxation for non-essential shops. “Traders are completely disappointed as there has been no relaxation given. This order will bring more burden as traders are already facing many issues for paying bills and the rent of shops,” said Mahendra Pitaliya, secretary of FTAP. Sunil Singh, owner of Delight footwear said, “There are many small traders on Laxmi road and they will be impacted badly as their savings have already been consumed during the 2020 lockdown.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/industries-seek-more-clarity-exemptions-on-lockdown-guidelines-101618406631031.html
14-04-2021||Delhi||Covid-19: Searching for a plasma donor? Delhi Police to the rescue||During the Covid-19 pandemic, the efforts of Delhi Police in curbing the spread of virus have been widely appreciated. And a group of constables from the force has been burning the midnight oil, to provide blood, plasma and platelets, to patients from various parts of the nation. Delhi Police Jivendayani (8800660677) — a Facebook page that connects people in need to police officers who can donate blood or plasma — is the brainchild of constables Ravinder Dhariwal and Amit Phogat, who are posted in the sixth battalion and outer district respectively. “We have been coordinating for blood and platelet donors since 2017... But during the pandemic, our work became even more pronounced since many people couldn’t go out to donate. So we arranged for platelet donation for cancer patients, plasma for Covid patients and blood for accident patients as per the requirement,” says Dhariwal, who has himself donated blood 61 times, so far. Going beyond their call of duty, do they end up making their families feel worried about their health? Probably yes, but it’s the thought of serving the human kind that often echoes in their conscious. Phogat recalls, “Pandemic mein families bolti thi ki jab koi bahar nahi ja raha, toh tumhe kya zarurat hai. But main yehi bolta tha ki yeh toh farz hai hum Police walon ka, logon ki madad karna!” The duo has successfully connected hundreds of police personnel around the city. “We have been doing this for a while, so blood banks, hospitals often have our numbers, and they provide our contact to those in need. Then we circulate the message among our colleagues, who go and donate whatever is required,” says Phogat, who has donated blood and platelets 73 times, a recent donation being the one to a cancer patient. The Police personnel associated with this group, provide donations free of charge. “We have arranged for donation of 200 units of plasma and over 800 units of blood in the Covid year. Yeh kaam toh hum bas apni responsibility samajh ke kar rahe hain. Kisi ki madad kar payein, isse bada sukh kya hai,” adds Dhariwal. Commando Ashish Dahiya, of Delhi Police, is another inspiring cop, who has donated his blood 99 times! He shares how his entire family cautioned him against donating blood initially, but are now big supporters of this cause. Helping people from other states, who are in the Capital for medical help, alongside dispelling rumours about blood donation, he says, “I once saw a young man die due to unavailability of blood at a hospital. It stayed with me, and made me learn more about donating blood. Ever since then, my primary aim has been to help patients who come here from other cities and may not have any contacts for help... People often believe that donating blood can cause weakness in them, and in the pandemic many didn’t venture out to help others. So we tried to make them aware about how safe it is to donate blood.” Dahiya’s work inspired Shankar Lal Rar, Head Constable, Delhi Police, presently posted in outer district’s Narela Police Station. “Ashish was the one who explained the concept of blood donation to me, and even in the pandemic, we have gone out to help anyone who needed it, especially during the lockdown. I recently donated platelets, for the thirty sixth time, and many from Delhi Police, who had recovered from Covid, donated plasma multiple times to others; even if it means travelling long distances after their shift,” says Rar, confessing, “We’ve full support of our seniors, but we aren’t part of this to seek praises. We do this, out of humanity!” Author tweets @bhagat_mallikaFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/covid19-searching-for-a-plasma-donor-delhi-police-to-the-rescue-101618406268289.html

The two men allegedly told the police that a medical representative, Chiranjiv Vishwakarma, arranged for the injections and was expected to meet them soon to pick up the money from their sale.Vishwakarma showed up and was also arrested.Vishwakarma allegedly told the police that he had bought the injections from the Hayaat hospital medical shop.The gang had offered three injections for total price of Rs. 59,000 as against the retail price of about Rs. 1,400 per injection.There have been reports of shortage of the injection from several states including Maharashtra, Gujarat and Jharkhand over the last few days and weeks. The Centre has insisted that there was overall no shortage of the drug but advocated its rational use.Niti Aayog member Dr VK Paul on Tuesday said it should not be used for patients at home. “The patient has to be on oxygen therapy, and the drug is supposed to be supplied only to hospitals and not to be sold in retail… It is not meant for everyone,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-doctor-2-others-arrested-for-selling-covid-19-drug-remdesivir-in-black-market-101618404105729.html

In the 300-year history of the temple, entry of devotees has been restricted for the second time owing to the outbreak of Covid-19,” he claimed.Sharing details about online booking, a trust member said, “Devotees can now book prasad online through an order request on mahavirnaivedyam@gmail.com or WhatsApp number 9334468400. We ensure same day delivery for bookings received before 4pm.”Similarly, Chhoti Patan Devi Temple has also resorted to online platforms for puja and darshan. The temple’s priest, Acharya Vivek Dwivedi, said, “Entry of devotees have been restricted to prevent mass gathering. We have provision for live streaming of ‘aarti’ and ‘havan’ via social media platforms. Those devotees who wish to perform puja can send their details and donations on WhatsApp number 7250901265. Our priest will perform puja with their names.”Devotees, however, rued that closure of temples had dampened the festive spirit. Pratima Mishra (65), a resident of Kankarbagh, said, “I wanted to visit Badi and Chhoti Patan Devi to seek blessings as I go there every year during Navratri. Religious places should have not closed completely and 50% visitors should have been allowed to enter at a time.”Small vendors selling puja articles near temples shared that they were suffering losses due to the closure of temples. Soni Kumari, a flower seller near Station Road, said, “Sale of flowers, leaves , garlands and other articles have declines by 80%. At least, 100 customers used to visit my stall on a daily basis in a normal situation. Usually, sales increase during festivals but we are suffering losses this time due to the sudden closure of temples.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/lowkey-navratri-celebrations-begin-in-bihar-temples-shut-down-amid-covid-19-spike-101618402185720.html

The hospital managements have sought help from the government to increase the number of beds. The IGMC has a total bed capacity of 100 and it is almost full. “We are making arrangements to increase the capacity in the hospital.

14-04-2021||Jaipur||Political appointments, Cabinet shuffle will be done without delay: Pilot||Senior Congress leader Sachin Pilot on Wednesday expressed confidence that the party will win all the three Rajasthan assembly seats going for bypolls on April 17. Addressing media at the state party office, Pilot also said that political appointments and Cabinet reshuffle will be done without delay. “I believe Congress will win on all three assembly seats [Sahara (Bhilwara), Sujangarh (Churu) and Rajsamand]. We have taken the government works and achievements to the public. People are unhappy with the divide and clashes there in the BJP – they have failed in fulfilling the role of strong Opposition,” said Pilot. He added that the Centre too had failed on all fronts -- such as inflation and agriculture laws – and people were watching this. On political appointments, he said, “Our government has completed 2-1/2 years and has fulfilled many of the promises. The remaining ones need to be fulfilled swiftly, which include political appointments, Cabinet reshuffle.” Pilot also said a committee, to address grievances within the party, was constituted but veteran leader Ahmed Patel passed away. “I have full faith that there will be no more delay, and whatever issues were raised, and consensus was built – immediate action will be and should be taken.” “I have faith on AICC chief Sonia Gandhi as the committee was formed on her directions. The committee now has two members. The bypolls will be soon over and even the assembly election in some states – I don’t think there should be any further delay in implementing the decisions of the committee,” said the former deputy chief minister. In response to Pilot’s assertion that his party will win all the three seats, BJP spokesperson Mukesh Pareek said people will vote against the 2.5 years of the state government. The government has failed in fulfilling the promises. The law and order situation is deteriorating. BJP is united and it’s the Congress which is a divided house, he said. Meanwhile, the BJP also sought the deployment of Central paramilitary forces for the bypolls, accusing the ruling Congress of misusing government machinery and threatening voters.A delegation of BJP leaders met Governor Kalraj Mishra and requested him to apprise the Election Commission of the issues raised by them in a representation handed over to him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/political-appointments-cabinet-shuffle-will-be-done-without-delay-pilot-101618398945484.html

14-04-2021||Mumbai||Ramadan 2021: Bombay HC denies permission for mass prayers at Mumbai mosque||The Bombay High Court on Wednesday refused permission to a city-based trust to allow people to offer Namaz at its mosque in south Mumbai during the Ramadan period, saying the COVID-19 situation was "serious and critical" and the safety of citizens was more importance.A vacation bench of Justices RD Dhanuka and VG Bisht noted that the Maharashtra government found it expedient to impose restrictions to break the chain of transmission of the coronavirus."The right to celebrate or follow a religious practice is important, but what is more paramount and of importance is public order and the safety of citizens," the court said.It was hearing a petition filed by the Juma Masjid Mosque Trust, seeking permission to allow people from the Muslim community to offer the prayers five times a day at its mosque in south Mumbai.The petitioner said the mosque is spread over an acre and around 7,000 people can assemble at a time.However, considering the COVID-19 situation, only 50 persons would be allowed at a time to offer prayers during the Ramadan period and all safety precautions would be followed, it said.Additional Government Pleader Jyoti Chavan, appearing for the Maharashtra government, opposed the plea and said the situation in Mumbai and Maharashtra is alarming."We cannot make an exception to any religion, especially in this 15-day period. We cannot take a risk at this stage and all citizens should cooperate," Chavan said.She said the government was not prohibiting any person from practising his/her religion, but they should do it in their homes.The court while dismissing the plea said it cannot consider the petitioner's request in view of the COVID-19 situation which is "serious and critical in nature"."In our view, the restrictions imposed by the state government are due to the COVID-19 circumstances. Considering the prevailing situation and ground reality in Maharashtra, we cannot permit the petitioner to perform prayers at the mosque," the HC said.The government's order of restrictions is in public interest and for the safety of all residents of Maharashtra, it said.The bench noted that in the past, several courts across the country refused permission to many other religious congregations due to the COVID-19 pandemic.Reeling under an unprecedented COVID-19 wave, the Maharashtra government on Tuesday announced severe restrictions on public movement over the next 15 days across the state.As part of the curbs, all religious places and malls shall remain shut.The restrictions, which exclude essential services, will come into effect from 8 pm on Wednesday and remain in force till 7 am on May 1.Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC), prohibiting assembly of five or more people at one spot, will be in force during this period, Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray said on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/ramadan-2021-bombay-hc-denies-permission-for-mass-prayers-at-mumbai-mosque-101618394226668.html

14-04-2021||Chandigarh||Dalit to be Punjab deputy CM if SAD voted to power: Sukhbir||Shiromani Akali Dal president Sukhbir Singh Badal on Wednesday announced that if his party was voted to power in 2022, the deputy chief minister would be a Dalit. Addressing a gathering after paying tributes to Dr BR Ambedkar on his 130th birth anniversary, the former deputy chief minister announced that the SAD will set up a university in Doaba named after the architect of the Constitution. He was accompanied by the SAD Nakodar MLA Gurpratap Singh Wadala and his Adampur counterpart Pawan Kumar Tinu. Dalits constitute 32% of the state’s population and are concentrated in Punjab’s Doaba region, comprising Jalandhar, Kapurthala, Hoshiarpur and Shaheed Bhagat Singh Nagar. A majority of them belong to the Ravidasia community. “The Akali Dal is proud to follow the ideals of Dr BR Ambedkar. We are committed to working for the weak and downtrodden. Once the SAD forms the government in Punjab in 2022, the deputy CM will be from the Dalit bhaichara. We will also establish a university in Doaba in Babasaheb’s name,” Sukhbir tweeted. On an alliance with the Bahujan Samaj Party, the Ferozepur member of Parliament said: “We have been in talks but will make an announcement once a tie-up is finalised.” All parties wooing Dalit votebank The Congress, BJP, Akalis and the Aam Aadmi Party have been going all out to woo Dalits in the state. In March, the Punjab government proposed to spend ₹100 crore on a BR Ambedkar Museum at Inder Kumar Gujral Punjab Technical University in Kapurthala during the budget session of the assembly. “The museum will be on the lines of the Statue of Unity in Gujarat,” said finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal. He also proposed a BR Ambedkar Institute of Management at IKGPTU, Kapurthala. In Februray, the BJP appointed Dalit leader and former Hoshiarpur MP Vijay Sampla as the chairman of the National Commission for Scheduled Castes. In 2016, before the Punjab assembly elections, the Aam Aadmi Party also promised a Dalit deputy chief minister if voted to power. During Wednesday’s function of the Shiromani Akali Dal, Covid-19 guidelines were given the go-by. Poll optics, says Amarinder In Chandigarh, Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh trashed Sukhbir’s statement as nothing but ridiculous poll optics. The Congress leader said the SAD and the BJP had failed to ensure the welfare of Dalits in the state for 10 years and were now resorting to political gimmickry to woo the community with an eye on the 2022 elections. “Sukhbir Badal is now promising a deputy chief minister but has nothing to show what he or his party, in alliance with the BJP ever did for the community,” the chief minister said, terming it a political antic aimed at misleading the people with an eye on votes. “It was ridiculous the way the BJP had also quickly jumped on to the wagon to promise a Dalit chief minister if it is elected by the people of Punjab,” he said, adding that given the angst against the party in the state over the farmers’ issue, even finding one winnable candidate would be a challenge for them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/dalit-to-be-punjab-deputy-cm-if-sad-voted-to-power-sukhbir-101618393845406.html
14-04-2021||Patna||Bihar: Navratri festival starts on a low-key note in Patna amid Covid curbs||The nine-day long Navratri festival started on a low-key note in Bihar’s capital of Patna on Tuesday. Most of the devotees offered prayers indoors since religious places were shut down by the state government till April 30 in view of the rapidly climbing Covid-19 cases in the second wave of the pandemic.However a few hundred disciples still gathered outside some famous temples ignoring administration’s appeals. Bihar reported 4,157 new Covid-19 cases on Tuesday with Patna adding 1,205 new infections- the highest single-day spike, taking the active Covid-19 cases in the state to 20,148, as per official data.Devotees were spotted offering prayers near the gates of Mahavir Mandir, Patan Devi Mandir, Shitila Mandir and Durga Sthan.Patna district magistrate Chandrashekhar Singh said a dedicated team was ensuring adherence to restrictions imposed on religious gatherings. “Police patrolling team is also keeping a strict vigil on crowded places to disperse crowds at public places. Besides, we are carrying out awareness drives through loudspeakers to sensitise people for maintaining social distancing,” he added.Dr Rajiv Ranjan Prasad, a former superintendent of Patna Medical College and Hospital (PMCH) said incidents of crowding during festivals posed a grave health risk.“While administration has to make sure people do not gather in and around temples, the priests should also discourage devotees to come to the temples during the festival days,” he said and add, “The same should also be followed during the four-day long Chhath festival in the state.”Few temples had made arrangements for virtual live darshan, online donation and booking for ‘prasad’. Mahavir Mandir near the Station Road has started live aarti darshan and online booking for Naivedyam ladoo.“Following the Covid-19 guidelines, we have restricted entry of devotees. However, puja rituals are being performed by the priest with full religious fervour and gaiety. Devotees can online book ‘prasad’ and we also have provision of live ‘arti’ darshan for devotees,” said Acharya Kishore Kunal, secretary of the Mahavir Mandir Trust.“More than 50,000 devotees visit the temple on Tuesdays and Thursdays while footfall of devotees increases manifold during festivals. Entry of devotees has been restricted for the second time owing to Covid-19 outbreak,” he claimed.Similarly, Chhoti Patan Devi Temple has also resorted to online platforms for puja and darshan. Temple’s priest Acharya Vivek Dwivedi, said, “Entry of devotees has been restricted to prevent mass gathering. We have provision for live streaming of ‘aarti’ and ‘havan’ via social media platforms. Those devotees who wish to perform puja can send their details and donations on WhatsApp number. Our priest will perform puja in their names.”Meanwhile, small vendors selling puja articles near temples said the closure of temples was causing them a big loss. “Sale of flowers, leaves, garlands and other articles have decreased by 80%. At least 100 customers visit my stall on a daily basis in normal situations. Usually, sales go up during festivals but we are suffering loss this time due to the closure of temples,” said Soni Kumari, a flower seller near Station Road.Some devotees rued that closure of temples dampened the festive spirit. “I wished to visit Badi and Chhoti Patan Devi for seeking blessings as I visit there every year during Navratri. Religious places should have not been closed completely and 50% devotees should have been allowed to enter at a time,” said Pratima Mishra (65), a resident of Kankarbagh area in the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-navratri-festival-starts-on-a-low-key-note-in-patna-amid-covid-curbs-101618393305237.html

Luckily, he did not sustain any injuries and was able to recover quickly from the stressful ordeal. We thank the people of Papalwadi village for their compassion and for saving the cub’s life,” said Dr. Nikhil Bangar, wildlife veterinary officer, Wildlife SOS.Pradeep Kasare, a range forest officer in Khed, also thanked the residents of Papalwadi for acting swiftly to save the baby leopard.The next day, the cub was put inside a small enclosure in a sugarcane field close to where he was first seen by the villagers, and remote-controlled camera traps were installed to photograph the cub’s reunion with its mother, which happened in the very first attempt, said officials. The cub was excited to spot his mother emerging from the field. She rushed to him, sniffed curiously around the box before pushing it open to fetch her child and vanished into the wild.“Over the years, the wild cats of Maharashtra have suitably adapted to habitat modification and have moved out of the shrinking forests, and into the dense sugarcane fields. Female leopards often leave their young under the cover of the sugarcane fields while they go hunting. However, these cubs face the risk of being exposed because farmers move around the fields, especially during the harvest season,” Wildlife SOS said in a statement on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/leopard-cub-rescued-from-feral-dogs-in-pune-district-101618392705802.html

The dacoits, said to be more than 15 in number, also broke the windows of the train’s air conditioned compartments, injuring at least six passengers before escaping to the nearby forests in the dark, said railway officials.More than 15 robbers entered the D6 and D8 compartments after the train was stopped by pulling the chain near Rishikund Halt, 15 kilometres from Jamalpur Junction at 10.15pm. Cell phones, cash and ornaments worth ₹5 lakh were looted in about 20 minutes, during which the dacoits also tried unsuccessfully to enter the A/C compartments. In frustration, they pelted stones and broke a few windows, injuring some passengers. Two police personnel were also injured, officials added.“The train stopped in a dense forest. Within minutes, I felt my chain [was] being pulled by someone,” said a passenger Ritesh Raj. When he raised an alarm, he was beaten up by the gang, he said.Some injured passengers alleged that the escort team, travelling in the AC compartment, did not intervene when passengers in D-6, D-8 compartments were being looted.

He needs to be questioned regarding the claims that he wanted Vaze to collect this scale of money every month.

14-04-2021||Chandigarh||Feeling happy, empowered, say Punjab’s first two DBT beneficiaries||Punjab’s first two direct benefit transfer (DBT) beneficiaries — Tarlochan Singh (48) of Rupnagar district’s Bhurara village and Dalip Singh (39) of Patiala’s Neelpur village — were all praise for the new system, saying the arhtiyas (commission agents) need not be apprehensive of the central government’s scheme. “I feel happy as I got the payment within 48 hours of procurement of my crop. I sold my wheat produce in the grain market on Sunday. Besides, I am excited for having become the first beneficiary of the scheme in the state,” said Tarlochan, who received ₹1.58 lakh in his account on Tuesday morning. “Earlier, it used to take 7- 10 days for the payment transfer. But this has come with a responsibility as now I have to manage the funds myself and not the arhtiya who did it in the past. Now we have to be careful about our spending as we do not have anyone to fall back on. But we will get used to the new system,” added the farmer who owns 10 acre agriculture land and has sold only a portion of his produce.Dalip Singh said he felt empowered as the old system has finally changed. “The arhtiyas used to delay payments to farmers for weeks and sometimes months and it led to overcharging and fleecing. There is no worry of being fleeced now. But the commission agents should not be worried as the age-old farmer-arhtiya relationship is here to stay. Farmers reposed faith in the arhtiyas for decades. The tables have turned now and it is their turn,” said the 39-year-old who received ₹1.48 lakh payment. Punjab food and civil supplies minister, who announced the names of the two beneficiaries, said the new system has been launched in the state successfully and all hiccups will be removed by the end of this week. The Centre has mandated DBT for payment of minimum support price (MSP) for farmers and insisted that the Punjab government implement it from the current rabi season. The state government was reluctant to implement the new system due to pressure exerted by the arhtiyas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/feeling-happy-empowered-say-punjab-s-first-two-dbt-beneficiaries-101618344946136.html

During a visit to Faridkot district to pay obeisance at the gurdwara at Burj Jawahar Singh Wala village from where a bir (copy) of Guru Granth Sahib was stolen in 2015, the Congress leader indirectly targeted the state government, claiming that “weak” lawyers represented the case in court. “I have come here on the occasion of Baisakhi to expose the conspiracy of sacrilege of Guru Granth Sahib. I am here to raise the voice of truth. A game of chess was set up wherein those who gave orders were protected while the pawns were attacked,” he added.“Why the lawyers representing the sacrilege cases were weak? Why top-notch lawyers were not fielded in the court? The ‘bir’ was stolen in June 2015 and it has been be six years now. People are still waiting for justice,” he said. Later, Sidhu uploaded a video of his visit titled “Justice delayed is justice denied” on his Facebook page and YouTube channel ‘Jittega Punjab’. Protest in Kotkapura over ‘delay’ in justiceThe families of Gurjeet Singh and Krishan Bhagwan Singh, who were killed in the police firing at Behbal Kalan, on Tuesday held a protest against delay in getting justice. The demonstration was held at Kotkapura Chowk where the police firing incidents took place on October 14, 2015. Sidhu, however, did not visit the protesting families. The protest was announced after the Punjab and Haryana High Court last week rejected the probe reports submitted by Punjab Police’s special investigation team (SIT) in connection with the Kotkapura firing and asked the state government to constitute a fresh SIT, excluding IGP Pratap. Sukhraj Singh, son of Krishan Bhagwan Singh, said “I don’t know why he (MLA Sidhu) chose to visit the gurdwara today and not support our cause. All political parties and religious outfits have failed to get us justice.”Youth Akali Dal president Parambans Singh Romana visited the Bargari gurdwara. “The Sikh community has been waiting for justice for a long time.

The court had also asked the state government to reconstitute the SIT without Kunwar Vijay. According to a senior government functionary, privy to the developments, the officer had shot off the resignation letter to Amarinder on Sunday and met the chief minister on Monday.“The state needs the expertise and experience of the officer who has contributed exceptional service to Punjab Police in various important positions,” said Amarinder in a statement on Tuesday.

Later, Sidhu shifted his political loyalty to the Akalis and again defeated Jassi with a record margin in 2014.In the 2017 polls, Sidhu faced an electoral debacle when he lost to AAP’s Baljnder Kaur, a novice candidate, and finished third.Speaking on the occasion, Sukhbir charged chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh with poor wheat procurement arrangements in the state. Sukhbir said Prime Minister Narendra Modi should listen to the voice of the masses and withdraw the three contentious farm laws.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sukhbir-declares-jeet-sidhu-as-sad-candidate-from-talwandi-sabo-101618343263013.html

While entrance exams for most undergraduate (UG) professional courses are planned for the end of this month or May, the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test for postgraduate (PG) medical students is scheduled to take place across the country on Sunday (April 18). With no word from the National Board of Examination (NBE) Tuesday, students are approaching state leaders, hoping for relief.Several PG medical aspirants, most of who are currently working at various hospitals across the state and country, have appealed to state medical education minister Amit Deshmukh that the entrance exam be postponed.“We [MBBS graduates] have been working day and night at various government and private hospitals across the state and many of our friends have also contracted the virus in the process. How are we expected to appear for an offline exam at a time when the state is planning to impose another lockdown?” said Manusha Patil, a NEET-PG applicant who is currently working at a make-shift jumbo centre in Pune. Last year, 160,000 NEET-PG aspirants of the 167,000 registered candidates had appeared for the exam. The total registrations for NEET-PG 2021 have not been revealed as yet. Several other students had also approached NBE, requesting authorities to postpone the NEET-PG exam. But in a statement released on NBE website earlier this week, the exam-conducting authority clarified that the entrance exam cannot be delayed any further.“Considering the importance of the examination in admitting PG students in their respective subjects for further training, it is in the best interest of candidates to continue to hold this examination on the announced date,” said a statement released on April 9. NBE, however, has assured students of added protective measures to ensure the exam is conducted smoothly.For instance, NBE has increased the total number of exam centres to ensure social distancing and also so that students do not have to travel far for the exam. Students are also being issued admit cards for the test along with an e-pass to ensure they are not stopped by authorities amid restrictions while traveling on the day of exam. Centres will also have a special isolation ward for students who record above normal temperature at the time of entering the exam centre. NBE also advised candidates feeling unwell or showing any symptoms to avoid appearing for the exam altogether.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/offline-neet-exam-on-sunday-pg-medical-aspirants-seek-maharashtra-leaders-help-101618342722305.html
14-04-2021||Mumbai||Let us open offices to conduct online coaching classes: Owners in Mumbai||Coaching class owners in the city have urged the state government to relax some lockdown rules so they can smoothly conduct their classes in the online mode.In a letter sent to the government on Tuesday, the Maharashtra Class Owners Association (MCOA) has demanded that the government allow class owners to open their offices and premises at least for teachers and staff members for now. “Till now we were allowed to keep our office open and run online lectures from our classes as we have a better internet facility and arrangements at our premises. Now, we are not allowed to open our class premises. We are not even able to conduct our online sessions properly and meet parents for proper counselling. The second lockdown has closed all our options of survival and has broken our backbone,” states the letter sent by MCOA.The association has also requested the government to allow offline classes once the process of reopening resumes yet again in the state. Since many students are not comfortable with online lectures, they don’t join coaching classes which has reduced our revenue by 60-70 % over the past one year. We request the government to allow us for offline lectures from our classes and restart our industry after unlocking this lockdown with proper SOP and guidelines so that we can consolidate and revive soon,” said Santosh Vaskar, president of MCOA. All non-essential shops and establishments in the city have been shut since April 5 as per the orders of the state government and the BMC. Coaching classes in several parts of the state such as Mumbai and Pune remain closed since March last year. MCOA and several other coaching class organisations had earlier requested the government to allow them to reopen for offline classes with proper standard operating procedures (SOPs) in place.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/let-us-open-offices-to-conduct-online-coaching-classes-owners-in-mumbai-101618342602377.html

The arhtiyas said there is shortage of gunny bags in the mandis and blamed the government’s new procurement system for the current situation.As per officials, only 22% of total 3.55 lakh MT wheat procured by government agencies in Karnal has been lifted and 2.76 lakh MT is still in the mandis.Karnal deputy commissioner (DC) Nishant Kumar Yadav said early arrival of peak season has led to space constraints as around 70% of the total wheat has already arrived in the mandis.“We cannot force farmers not to bring their produce to mandi as around 50% farmers do not have their own tractor-trolleys and have to hire the vehicles. We have no other option than to unload the produce on roads,” said an arhtiya at Indri grain market.In Kurukshetra, farmers unloaded their wheat on Brahma Sarovar roads. Of total 1.91 lakh MT wheat procured in district, only 33,189 MT wheat has been lifted and over 1.57 lakh MT wheat is still lying in mandis in district.Kurukshetra DC Sharandeep Kaur Barar said that instructions were issued to transporters for speedy lifting of the procured wheat from the mandis. She said farmers should bring their produce to mandis as per schedule.Similarly, in Kaithal, of total 1.90 lakh MT procured wheat, only 50,000 MT wheat was lifted by procurement agencies, leading to space issue in most mandis in district. Officials associated with the procurement agencies said harvesting of wheat is on peak and due to space problems in mandis, transporters are facing problem for lifting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/glutlike-situation-in-haryana-mandis-farmers-block-state-highway-for-over-five-hours-101618342551805.html
14-04-2021||Other||Wetland destruction in Navi Mumbai: NGT to hear plea on Thursday||Activists have approached the National Green Tribunal (NGT) over the alleged continued destruction of Panje wetland in Raigad’s Uran taluka. The site, as per the petition filed by activist Nandakumar Pawar, is regarded as the largest migratory waterbird congregation site at Navi Mumbai by the Bombay Natural History Society. The matter has been listed for hearing on April 15.The Panje coastal wetland is a low-lying area of approximately 289 hectares circumscribed by Panje, Phunde, Dongari and Bokadvira villages. It is bordered by mangroves on the west and the east and has mangroves inside the wetland at some locations. Activists have alleged large-scale landfilling of earth over mangroves, and have accused City and Industrial Development Corporation (Cidco) of blocking the flow of seawater to intertidal forests.While a broader petition is currently being heard on the matter in the Bombay hight court, the petitioners said they have approached NGT for an urgent hearing. The plea made is for official instructions to be given to Cidco for opening up all five of their water inlets and to allow tidal water to flow into Panje. Pawar has also sought directions for the Raigad district collector to ensure that no further impediments are created in the free flow of water to the Panje wetland, either through the blocking of culverts, pumping out of water, reclamation or through other means.Despite an order issued by environment minister Aaditya Thackeray on March 4 last year in response to a petition by NatConnect Foundation, there have been repeated instances of landfilling reported in the area. The Maharashtra Coastal Zone Management Authority (MCZMA) had previously also directed the Raigad collector to ensure all blocks of tidal water flow are removed. MCZMA has also filed an affidavit before HC, clarifying that the area in question falls under Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ)-1, and that due to presence of mangroves no construction can be allowed there. “Despite these developments, there has been absolutely no change on the ground. It is a matter of great urgency, which is why we approached NGT. It was done at the behest of HC itself,” said Pawar.“Clause 3(iv) of CRZ notification, 2011, prohibits the reclamation, bunding or disturbing the natural course of sea water and sets out a limited set of exceptions to this. Clause 3(xii) stipulates an absolute prohibition on any kind of construction activity in CRZ-1 except those set out in clause 8 of the notification. A perusal of clause 8 of CRZ notification will bear out that blocking the tidal ingress of water to CRZ areas is not permitted,” stated Pawar’s petition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/wetland-destruction-in-navi-mumbai-ngt-to-hear-plea-on-thursday-101618342422329.html

The state reported over 60,000 fresh Covid-19 cases on Tuesday. Thackeray, in an address to the state on Tuesday, also announced a package of ₹5,476 crore to help marginalised sections, including daily wagers, rickshaw drivers, maids, construction workers, among others, during this period. With the imposition of Section 144, people will not be able to travel far from home for non-essential activities. However, essential services have been exempted from restrictions between 7am and 8pm. Thackeray said rising cases have burdened the state’s health infrastructure and merely discussions cannot be afforded.“From tomorrow [Wednesday] 8pm Section 144 will be imposed to break the chain of transmission for the next 15 days. We will have to completely stop unnecessarily stepping out of the home, till now I used to say, avoid stepping out. I expect you to observe ‘Janta curfew’ and not step out of the home, unless absolutely necessary,” Thackeray said in his address.Announcing the new restrictions, the chief minister put the onus on citizens to adhere to Covid-19 safety measures in order to prevent the spread. “People have to decide whether they want to help corona or the government that is working to curb it.”He added, “We had two laboratories, now it has gone to 523, but the load on them has increased. We used to test around 85,000 samples, now it has gone to 250,000 [daily]. The last time we had 2,665 Covid Care Centers, which has been increased to nearly 4,000. All types of hospital beds, including isolation, oxygenated, ICU, etc, have increased from 325,000 to 350,000. But now, these facilities are burdened.” He further said that the administration has been instructed to ramp up health infrastructure.Hospitals, diagnostic centres, clinics, vaccinations, medical insurance offices, pharmacies, pharmaceutical companies, other medical and health services, groceries, vegetable shops, fruit vendors, dairies, bakeries, cold storage and warehousing services, public transport, including flights, trains, taxis, autos, and public buses, transport services, pre-monsoon work, banks, ATMs, Sebi recognised institutions, agriculture-related activities, petrol pumps, etc have been categorised in the essential category by the order issued by chief secretary Sitaram Kunte under “Break the Chain” initiative of the state.Shopping centres, malls, film and serial shootings, beaches, gardens, will be shut.

Autos will be allowed to have two passengers only, excluding the driver; taxis will be allowed to operate with 50% of vehicle capacity, while public buses will not be allowed to ferry any standees. Ecommerce will be allowed for the delivery of essential goods and services. Milk and newspapers will be allowed to be delivered at home. Manufacturing units for essential services can run on full capacity.The suburban trains, however, will not be open to general public. It will only operate for people who are associated with essential services for the next 15 days.Informing the people about the low availability of oxygen in the state, Thackeray said he will be writing to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to allow the air force to supply oxygen in the state. He added that the states permitted to supply oxygen include north eastern states and West Bengal “I am going to write to prime minister to allow other states to supply oxygen to Maharashtra. Instead of by road transport of oxygen from other state, if we can get oxygen through the support of Air Force. By the time, supply reaches the state by road, the situation will worsen in the state,” he said. Thackeray said that the government was aware of the hardships faced by the poor due to the restrictions and that the state government had decided to take steps to provide some relief. “Seven crore beneficiaries under the food security scheme will get 3 kg wheat and 2 kg rice per person for free for one month. The Shiv Bhojan thali, which was priced at Rs5, will be provided for free,” he said. The government will also provide Rs1,500 to each of the 1.2 million registered construction workers and 0.5 million registered hawkers. 1.2 registered rickshaw drivers will be given Rs1,500 as their livelihood will be impacted due to the restrictions. Around 12 lakh Tribal families will be paid Rs2,000 per family under the Khavti scheme and Rs3,300 crore are being given via district-level schemes in fight against the pandemic, he said.Thackeray also appealed to opposition political parties to not politicise the fight against Covid-19, but instead joins hands with the government to beat the pandemic.Leader of opposition in Maharashtra, Devendra Fadnavis, advised the government to use Rs3,300 crore allocated for adding beds, medical equipment, etc.Fadnavis criticised the government relief package and said, “Chief minister only thought of a few sections. No relief was provided for Bara Balutedar, small business owners, workers in saloons, flower vendors. They constitute a major chunk of the workforce, they must immediately take decision to include them. The state should have announced concessions for electricity bills, property tax, GST etc. We demand that the government must immediately take decision in this regard, “ Fadnavis said in a series of tweets.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-imposes-curfew-essential-services-to-run-101618342362373.html

Vidarbha, Marathwada and central Maharashtra (includes Pune) meteorological divisions are likely to see near-normal rainfall, while slight deficiencies are expected along the Konkan and Goa coast, meteorologists at private forecaster Skymet said on Tuesday.However, as the average monthly rainfall for Konkan (that includes Mumbai) and Goa, is consistently higher than Vidarbha, a deficiency of even 10-15% will not affect water supply or agricultural productivity. Mumbai and Pune are both expected to receive sufficient rains, according to Skymet.“We do not foresee any scarcity of rain in the region. Even in typically drought-prone Marathwada, there will be near-normal rainfall as was the case last year too. Vidarbha faced deficient rainfall last year, but this year, there will be better rain there too,” said Mahesh Palawat, vice-president, meteorology and climate change, Skymet.In its preliminary forecast for India, Skymet said the rainfall from June to September is likely to be 103% of the long period average (LPA) of 88cm based on average monsoon rain from 1961 to 2010. In 2020 and 2019, monsoon was above normal at 110% and 109% of LPA respectively. “For Maharashtra also, it will be the third good monsoon. And the interior parts will benefit a little more than in the earlier two seasons,” Palawat added.last week, several parts of the Vidarbha, Marathwada and central Maharashtra witnessed pre-monsoon showers due to a cyclonic circulation which had formed over parts of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. While Pune had reported hailstorms in some pockets, isolated drizzles were also felt in Mumbai over the weekend.When contacted, two officials of the India Meteorological Department’s regional forecasting centre in Mumbai said they would not be able to comment on Skymet’s forecast. “Our seasonal forecast is expected to come out this week.

14-04-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai Police start virtual meetings to address issues||Amid the surge in Covid-19 cases in the city, to redress citizen’s grievances and encourage public participation in solving local issues, the Mumbai Police have initiated virtual public meetings through Zoom and WhatsApp video conferencing.On Monday, senior police officers of the force started a virtual interaction with traders association members, establishments association representatives, community leaders, local politicians, businessmen as well as people from various walks of life through Zoom meeting. “The initiative aims at reaching out to maximum people to know their grievances and issues, due to the imposition of another lockdown and come up with solutions by mutual understanding and dialogues. Virtual communication would also help avoid public meetings and gatherings. This method is also effective in getting the cooperation and involvement of the citizens in battling the present crisis,” joint commissioner of police, law and order, Vishwas Nangre Patil said. As part of the initiative, all beat chowki in-charges, senior inspectors of all 95 police stations, assistant commissioner of police (ACP), deputy commissioners of police (DCP) and additional commissioner of police have been asked to form multiple WhatsApp groups in their respective regions to know about the problems faced by people from all sections of society during pandemic and lockdown and solve them with the participation of concerned people. The joint commissioner of police, law and order, Vishwas Nangre Patil, was added to all groups. Patil could make surprise visits anytime during the virtual meetings and check if it is being done properly. The initiative also aims to reach out to people by maintaining much needed social distancing.ACPs and senior police inspectors would be administrators of WhatsApp groups, which would include local retailers/trader groups’ representatives, school-colleges principles, members of religious prayers halls/trusts, local civic corporation officials, community leaders, social workers, NGO members, members of labourers groups, migrants and members of slum and Muhalla committees, etc. While DCPs and additional CPs would form groups for virtual public meetings of members of associations of hotels, traders, e-commerce site operators, app-based food, grocery delivery service operators, shop owners, citizens associations, members of taxi-auto unions, executives of app-based taxi operators, private hospitals, senior Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) officials and concerned state government department officials. “From street vendors to big traders, everyone has been connected to police through this platform. Without physically meeting we are listening to people’s problems, providing them help, taking suggestions and enhancing our response to serve them better. This method lowers the risk of contractions of the virus and also discourages people from taking to streets to stage protests, morcha, dharnas, etc.,” said an IPS officer requesting anonymity.The city police have also called in additional security personnel from reserve police force for swift implementation of lockdown restrictions, another senior officer said.The virtual public meetings will also help reduce the growing infection among police personnel. So far 101 policemen from the Mumbai Police force have died of Covid infection, while total 7,997 cases of infection have been reported since April 2020. Presently the city police force has 460 active infected policemen.Meanwhile, 30,760 police officers have taken the first vaccine dose and 17,360 have taken the second dose. However, as the families of most of the policemen are still deprived of vaccines, the police personnel will have to be as alert as last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-police-start-virtual-meetings-to-address-issues-101618341882311.html

This, say, officials, could’ve helped control the cases on the institute’s premises in comparison to the week before last.“Our (on-campus) hospital was full last week, but after we shifted students eligible for home isolation to the Hostel-16 C wing, the bed availability in the hospital has improved. We currently have 17 inpatients, and four patients have been shifted to outside hospitals. At present, there are 20 active cases among students,” said an official message circulated by the institute’s deputy director of academic and infrastructural affairs (AIA), Prof. S Sudarshan. He added that analysis done by their contact tracing team indicates that most infections are coming from travel/commute outside the IIT-B campus, although there are some cases of transmission from within the campus as well.“The Covid situation in Mumbai continues to be worrying. While a partial lockdown is already in place, there are talks of a harder lockdown In the city. Even if there is a lockdown, we will continue to run our hostel messes and we have also made contingency plans to ensure supply of food to our hostel residents,” states the message addressed to the campus residents. “As of now not many students have approached us, but we have made it clear that if they want to leave, they may do so after discussing the travel risks with their parents,” said Prof Sudarshan.As per information shared by the institute, at present 2,000 staff members (including faculty, institute staff and project staff) live with their respective families on campus and around 3,000 students have returned to the campus. As a precautionary measure, the institute has already stopped in-person eating at any restaurants on campus (food delivery is allowed), while the hostel mess is functional with safety norms strictly being followed.“Since the beginning of the pandemic, room sharing was stopped and students were placed in individual rooms. In hostels where we’ve found multiple cases, we have asked students to take away food from the hostel mess instead of eating there. We have also shut down all sports facilities as per governor’s orders and we regularly reprimand students who flout safety norms,” added Prof Sudarshan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-60-active-cases-on-iit-b-campus-students-authorities-concerned-101618341822908.html

The proposed hostel will have 450-rooms and is expected to house around 1,000 women.Awhad said several women from other parts of the state migrate to Mumbai for employment but do not have a proper place to reside, and often have to stay in distant suburbs outside Mumbai city. “Mumbai is the financial capital and therefore, several women from various parts of Maharashtra come here for work. But here they do not have a proper place to live. They have to live in far-flung suburbs such as Vasai-Virar or Dombivli and beyond. The proposed hostel will come at Tardeo, which has proximity to railway stations, including Mumbai Central, Grant Road and Mahalaxmi. We will build a hotel for around 1,000 women. The entire project will be completed in about two years,” Awhad said. The construction cost of the hostel is estimated to be around ₹35 crore, senior Mhada officials said, adding that it will start the tendering process within six months. The minister added that the hostel will not be run by Mhada but an independent agency. He also said that the housing body will decide on the criteria for allotment of the hostel rooms as the project progresses.According to Mhada chief executive officer Anil Diggikar, Mhada has three transit buildings near MP Mill compound in Tardeo, whose occupants will be shifted out to the slum rehabilitation authority’s (SRA) transit facility. “The plot size is 1,918 square metres, with an FSI (floor space index) of 3 and we can construct 8,000 square metres of fungible FSI. There will be 450 rooms of 180 square feet each,” Diggikar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/maharashtra-housing-body-to-build-working-women-s-hostel-in-south-mumbai-101618341822336.html

About 40% of them have taken their second dose. There is no shortage of vaccine. We need proper planning to speed up vaccination,” he said.State authorities expect the arrest of the spike in the Covid-19 cases over the next few days owing to the measures.Dr Avinash Supe, head of state-appointed death audit committee, said they expect the peak by the end of the month. “We were expecting the peak by April 15, but it is now likely to take a couple of more weeks. After a plateau for 10 days we can expect the downward trend thereafter. We had reported a peak in May-June and then in September-October in 2020. The surge started in February end, which can be see peak by April end,” he said.Dr Ravi Wankhedkar, former national president of Indian Medical Association, said rapid vaccination could help the state in reducing the spread.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-sees-60-000-new-covid-19-cases-101618341703329.html

14-04-2021||Delhi||Covid-19 fear takes sheen out of Navratri, Ramzan festivities in Delhi||Navratri and Ramzan, during which devotees observe fasts and participate in special prayers, began on Tuesday with several places of worship in Delhi enforcing Covid-19 protocols at a time when the Capital is going through its worst phase of the pandemic.The city on Tuesday reported 13,468 cases, the highest ever single-day spike, and 81 people died of the infection, according to the Delhi government’s daily health bulletin.At Kalkaji Mandir, devotees were seen waiting in long queues for their turn to enter the temple. Authorities also issued e-passes to regulate the crowd. No prasad or offerings were allowed in the temple.At Jhandewalan temple, the aarti was performed only in the morning in the presence of priest and temple staff, with no members of the public allowed. Similarly, at the Chhattarpur Temple, the aarti was performed by the temple staff, while it remained closed for devotees.Many other temples in the city saw few devotees turn up due to the rising number of Covid-19 cases and strict vigil by the authorities. During Navratri, Hindus offer prayers to the different avatars of the goddess Durga, and fast for nine days.Surendra Nath Avdhoot, mahant (head priest) Kalkaji Mandir, said the footfall of devotees on Tuesday was much lower compared to previous years, even as the management of the temple ensured that those who visited the temple followed physical distancing norms.“On the first of Navratri today (Tuesday) only 10,000 to 15,000 devotees turned up for darshan. In previous years, around 100,000 people used to visit the temple. To discourage crowding, we have put in place a system of e-passes. However, some devotees who were without passes were also allowed darshan. Nobody is being allowed to enter without a mask. We have deployed volunteers to ensure that no one violates social distancing norms even while they stand in queue,” Avdhoot said.At local mosques across the city, the management put up posters on the gates, warning people to wear masks and maintain social distancing.At several mosques, spots to place prayer mats were marked to ensure social distancing, while hand sanitisers were provided at the gates.The Shahi Imam of the Jama Masjid, Syed Ahmed Bukhari, on Tuesday appealed to Muslims to follow all Covid-19 protocols during Ramzan and try to pray at home as far as possible to ensure there is no crowding at mosques.In a video posted on social media, Bukhari said, “I have been getting news of people dying of the infection. We must follow the Covid-19 protocols. People have been lax in following the mask rule. They must wear a mask in public places. We have removed the carpet from Jama Masjid and put stickers so that those coming to perform namaaz follow social distancing. I appeal to all local mosques that they should remove mats/carpets and put stickers. I also appeal to the people to not crowd the mosques and try to perform taraweeh (special night prayers during Ramzan) at home as much as possible.”During Ramzan, Muslims fast for a month between sunrise and sunset and perform special night prayers. The month culminates in the festival of Eid-ul fitr. Crowding in mosques and markets is common during Ramzan.The popular Jhandewalan Devi Mandir also remained closed for devotees on Tuesday. Some people were seen offering prayers outside the temple. Only the temple staff attended the morning and evening aartis.“It is sad that we can’t go inside the temple and take the blessings of Matarani (goddess Durga) during Navratri. But the safety of people is also equally important, so it’s a wise decision to keep the temple closed for the public,” said Ramesh Chandra Gupta, a devotee, outside the Jhandewalan temple.A functionary at the Jhandewalan Devi temple, who asked not to be named, said: “The safety of the devotees is paramount for us. We have made arrangements of live broadcast of aarti on the temple website.”The district administration maintained vigil to discourage crowding at temples.Vishwendra, district magistrate (south-east), said the Kalkaji Mandir is the biggest temple in the region, so elaborate arrangements were made to ensure that there is no crowding and people follow Covid-19 appropriate behaviour.“We have deployed over 100 civil defence volunteers in and around Kalkaji temple to keep a vigil. We have also issued fines against violators. In the temple premises, we have also shut shops that used to sell prasad, flowers and other offerings. People were largely seen following Covid guidelines,” he said.A senior official of the central district, who also asked not to be named, said, “Constant vigil was maintained around temples and also in residential neighbourhoods to ensure that religious gatherings do not take place. We are strictly enforcing Covid-19 guidelines.”Talking about arrangements at the Kalkaji temple, deputy commisioner of police (southeast) RP Meena said that nearly 100 police personnel were deployed around the temple for security, and to ensure that the devotees followed the Covid guidelines.“The temple management has issued e-passes and only those who had valid passes were allowed to enter the temple. Inside the temple, circles have been made on the floor for the devotees to wait in a queue. Nobody was found violating the rules,” said Meena.Meanwhile, at the Jhandewalan temple, police personnel were deployed in adequate numbers as part of their anti-terror measures as well as to enforce Covid-19 appropriate behaviour in the premises, said DCP (central) Jasmeet Singh.“All the rituals were performed behind the closed gates,” he said.As per data released by the Delhi Police, 3,155 people were prosecuted for mask violations and 56 challans were issued for not following social distancing across the city till 4pm on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/covid19-fear-takes-sheen-out-of-navratri-ramzan-festivities-in-delhi-101618341352426.html
14-04-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Kumbh, political rallies to lead to national lockdown, says Sanjay Raut||Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut said that with lakhs of seers crowding in Haridwar for Kumbh and political rallies being attended by lakhs in West Bengal, it would not be surprising if a national lockdown is imposed soon. The Sena chief spokesperson also said the cases in Maharashtra are going up due to the migrant population that comes to Maharashtra from states where there are no restrictions. “It will not be surprising if such a decision on lockdown will be taken not just in Maharashtra but across the country. Yesterday, we saw lakhs of people gather in Haridwar, in West Bengal there are rallies with thousands of people. Compared to that, there is a lot of control over such things in Maharashtra,” Raut said on Tuesday. The Sena leader said that the Uddhav Thackeray-led government is trying hard to curb the Covid-19 cases in the state but other states do not have control over the disease and people are migrating to Maharashtra. “They should have kept control on the lakhs of seers who got together in Haridwar. Today, we have our new year (Gudi Padwa) but the chief minister has kept restrictions. We do not like it but we have taken these decisions.” Last week, Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) chief Raj Thackeray had blamed the migrant workers for the surge in Covid-19 cases in the state. The Shiv Sena MP took on the BJP-led central government and Election Commission over the 24-hour ban from campaigning on West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee saying the decision seems to have been taken at the behest of the BJP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-kumbh-political-rallies-to-lead-to-national-lockdown-says-sanjay-raut-101618341582312.html
14-04-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Migrants rush to return to hometowns||Amid the stringent curbs, migrant workers across Mumbai are forming a beeline to return to their native states, with huge crowds seen outside Lokmanya Tilak Terminus (LTT) on Tuesday afternoon. Railway authorities, however, maintained crowding was due to people travelling outside the city during summer vacation. Both Central and Western Railway are allowing only travellers who have booked the tickets in advance due to Covid-19 rules. The zonal railways are operating daily additional special outstation trains towards North India, including Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand, Bihar and Assam. The Western Railway is also likely to operate a few special trains towards different destinations in North India. “The crowd at LTT, Kurla isn’t something very unusual. It is a routine summer season rush. Today, a total of 23 trains are scheduled to depart from LTT, of which 16 are either north-bound or east-bound. Of these 16, five are summer special trains.” said Shivaji Sutar, chief public relations officer, Central Railway. The city is also witnessing queues at outstation bus stops. Many workers fear loss of jobs, along with the trouble they went through during the 2020 lockdown, when many had to start walking to reach their hometowns. Noor Alam, who works as a salesman in a garment shop at Kurla, said, “Last year I had to wait for a month to board the train operated specially for migrant workers. I know the troubles I faced and how I survived with very little money. My friends have already left for their native places and even I am planning to do so shortly.” Autorickshaw driver Nilesh Kadam was desperately trying to get a bus ticket to Kankavali in Konkan. “I am hardly able to get one passenger daily from the international airport and with the lockdown, there is no way I can survive. In my village, at least I will be able to fulfil my basic needs,” said Kadam. Many private transport operators are running buses to places like Rajasthan, Uttarakand, Gujarat and even Uttar Pradesh. “As I am not getting train tickets, I plan to go to Uttarakhand by bus,” said Shivani Aswal, a saleswoman who is working in a cosmetics store in Andheri. “Though it will take at least four days, it is better than staying in lockdown in Mumbai.” Of the 350 workers at Angrezi Dhaba, which has seven outlets in Mumbai, 250 have returned. “We offered to pay them half the salary if they stayed back, but they were adamant to return. There was a lot of pressure from their families back home,” said Raj Sadvikar, co-founder and partner, Angrezi Dhaba. “There is no way we can stop them, but we are worried about how to bring them back once the situation normalises. It’s going to be tough,” said Mohan Gurnani, chairman, Chamber of Associations of Maharashtra Industries and Trade (CAMIT).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-migrants-rush-to-return-to-hometowns-101618341402290.html
14-04-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: BMC control rooms to handle bodies||In the backdrop of rising deaths in the city owing to Covid-19, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has revised its guidelines to ensure smooth passage for cremation of patients. As part of caution amid rising cases, every hospital or jumbo centre will have to route disposal of bodies via its 24 ward-level control rooms. The BMC provides cremation at 46 traditional facilities, followed by 11 electric crematoriums and 18 gas pyres. The circular giving out revised guidelines is expected to be out by this week. Currently, as per the protocol, once a death is reported of a Covid-19 patient, the hospital informs the family, after which it arranges for an ambulance to carry out last rites. Ambulance drivers and staff are supposed to be wearing PPE kits, mask and gloves. The body is later wrapped in a bag and taken to the crematorium or place of burial. As of now, five members of the family are allowed to attend the last rites, as per World Health Organisation protocols. However, this will change as hospitals will be required to contact ward war control rooms for the same.According to revised guidelines that are expected to be out this week, ward control rooms will coordinate with crematoriums about availability of slots. This, the BMC claims, is to ensure there is no queue at the crematoriums, in case the situation worsens in the coming days. The mortality rate in the city as of now is 2.50%, however, in terms of deaths being reported daily, the numbers have gone up. The city was reporting around five deaths daily, but the same went up to around 15 daily by March-end, and in the second week, over 30 deaths are being reported daily. Last week, the city had also reported a six-month-high for single day of 79 deaths. According to figures, the city reported the first death due to Covid-19 on March 17, 2020. So far, over 12,000 deaths have been reported. Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner, said, “We will issue a circular that will make it mandatory for hospitals to report deaths to ward-level war control rooms. This will ensure there is a smooth process for cremation of dead bodies, and unnecessary waiting can be avoided at crematoriums.” A BMC official said, “Mumbai has even handled around 150 deaths on a daily basis, and currently the situation is not alarming. We are introducing such a mechanism in anticipation of situation deteriorating in the coming days.” Meanwhile, according to state health department data, Mumbai had witnessed a peak of deaths due to Covid-19 between June 2020 and October 2020, during which over 8,000 deaths were reported in the city. The number of deaths started falling since November 2020, however, the numbers rose in April 2021. Dr Siddarth Paliwal, a city-based physician, said, “The second wave is being reported in the city owing to different variants of the virus, and if we want to ensure the death rate remains low, we need to continue increasing the number of tests, aggressively undertake contact-tracing and treat them. These are the only steps that can bring down mortality until a substantial number of the population is vaccinated.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-bmc-control-rooms-to-handle-bodies-101618341282288.html
14-04-2021||Chandigarh||11,400 devotees reach for Vaishno Devi pilgrimage, 71 travellers test positive||The nine-day Navratri festival began on a cautious note in the wake of the pandemic as 11,400 pilgrims reached Katra, the base camp to the holy cave shrine of Vaishno Devi in Reasi district of Jammu and Kashmir, on Tuesday. Earlier, around 25,000 to 30,000 pilgrims would throng the cave shrine per day. “From 5am to 6pm on Tuesday, 11,400 pilgrims had obtained yatra slips—4,400 offline and 7,000 online. The figures are significantly low as compared to the pre-pandemic time,”an official said. Last year, the shrine had been closed on March 18 and re-opened on August 16 after a hiatus of almost five months. A health official said 71 travellers had tested positive in Katra on the first day of the festival. “On Tuesday, we detected 85 new cases in Reasi, which included 71 travellers, 11 locals and two staff members. So far, 498 people have tested positive in Reasi,” he said. The travellers who tested positive were either sent back in specially designed cabs to Pathankot or kept in isolation. “Largely, travellers who tested positive preferred to return home, for which the administration has kept seven to eight cabs. For those, who choose to remain at Katra, the administration has the provision of paid quarantine in Katra and government quarantine at Panthal,” the official said. Sources within shrine board said inviting devotional singers while the second wave of the pandemic is sweeping through the UT was irrational. “Considering the surge in cases, the morning and evening aartis should have been left to the priests and singers of the shrine board,” they said. At 5,200ft, the cave shrine is one of the holiest Hindu pilgrimages and devotees from all over the country and abroad visit the shrine on auspicious days. The administration has fixed a ceiling of 25,000 pilgrims a day. Pilgrims arriving in trains to Katra will undergo rapid antigen tests (RATs) at the Katra railway station where Covid kiosks have been set up. Those arriving via road will undergo the test at Lakhanpur—the gateway to Jammu and Kashmir. Local devotees will be tested at Banganga and flying in will be tested at the Jammu airport. However, it is advisable for pilgrims coming from outside J&K to bring their Covid-19 negative reports, preferably RT-PCR test, not older than 72 hours. The cave shrine was visited by 13,089 pilgrims on April 11. Last year, in August, the figures had dipped to 7,253 and 27,427 in September before picking up momentum in October when 1,21,661 pilgrims visited the shrine followed by 1,03,749 devotees in November and 2,07,533 in December. In January, 4,08,061 pilgrims had visited the shrine, 3,89,549 in February and in March the count was around 3.5 lakh. Meanwhile, shat chandi maha yagya commenced at the cave shrine on first day of the festival amid chanting of vedic mantras and performance of other religious ceremonies. The maha yagya, which is being performed during navratras for peace, prosperity and health of humanity, will conclude with a purna ahuti on Ramanavami. Board CEO Ramesh Kumar said elaborate arrangements have been made to facilitate the pilgrims who are expected to visit the holy cave shrine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/11400-devotees-reach-for-vaishno-devi-pilgrimage-71-travellers-test-positive-101618340983911.html
14-04-2021||Mumbai||Nagpur hospitals discharge patients early to admit others||As the second Covid wave sweeps Nagpur causing an unprecedented spurt in cases and mortalities, the city is also reeling under an equally unprecedented shortage of hospital beds. With the rising number of patients needing hospitalisation, hospitals – Government Medical College and Hospital and Indira Gandhi Medical College and private hospital in particular -- have resorted to early discharge of patients to make way for new patients needing a bed. In the process, the patients already under the spell of the virus and who have not yet recovered, face various other health complications and need hospitalisation again. Take the case of Sunil Madavi, 26, who works as an attendant at a city cancer hospital. Sunil was admitted to the GMCH after he contracted coronavirus last month. “He was discharged within nine days. After reaching home, he was disoriented, did not recognise family or friends and spoke incoherently. We got him admitted to a private hospital sensing something was amiss,” Madavi’s colleague Anup Thakre said. Subsequent tests showed Madavi was still reeling under Covid infection. “We again admitted him to GMCH and this time we requested the hospital authorities to discharge him only after he recovers. But he was discharged after 10-12 days and shifted to another government facility for quarantine,” said Madavi’s father Wamanrao. The GMCH superintendent Dr Avinash Gawande said that they have only 900 Covid-19 beds. “It’s really very difficult to accommodate everyone as hardly 18-20 patients get discharge per day as against 70-80 new admissions every day,” he said. It is even alleged that two Covid patients were made to share a bed, reflecting the frightening reality of the bed crisis. Officials, who preferred anonymity, say the bed shortage is also because people flock to government hospitals to avoid the exorbitant cost of treatment at private hospitals. Even private hospitals divert critical patients to government hospitals. Dr Gawande said that after arranging for more beds, the crisis is manageable. Former guardian minister of Nagpur and state BJP general secretary Chandrashekhar Bawankule alleged that those with Covid were being admitted in the same ward as patients being treated for other illnesses. “There are no beds in Nagpur,” he said. The pathetic situation of the government hospital could be gauged from the fact that a unique sit in dharna in front of government-run medical college and hospital here was staged on April 11 by the resident doctors to highlight the inconvenience which patients are facing due to neglect of district administration there. The agitating doctors highlighted the shortage of beds, oxygen cylinders etc. at the government hospital and blamed the district administration for not co-operating in the Covid-19 pandemic situation, even though it was going on since last year and have gone from bad to worse in the last one month. Dr Sanjay Chilkar, the nodal officer of Nagpur Municipal Corporation for Covid-19 management said that Covid cases were initially reported from slums and highly congested areas. “Now we find cases from the middle-income population and entire households are getting affected -– a phenomenon more pronounced in the second wave.” He blames people’s carelessness towards Covid-safety norms of —wearing masks, avoiding large gatherings and crowded places for the spurt in infections. Two days before Holi, the main markets of Sitabuldi and Itwari areas were teeming with people and vehicles. People were out shopping for Holi and buying vegetables and fruits from scores of vendors. There was a constant stream of vehicles. Pedestrians, many of them without masks, were walking slowly, brushing past each other, Chilkar pointed out. Holi was on March 28. And after Holi, as many as 40,646 positive cases were reported from Nagpur city within two weeks, that’s virtually double than the last month’s figure when an average 2250-2500 cases were reported every day. Following the Covid surge, the district administration in Nagpur imposed a partial lockdown from February 1 and later a total lockdown from 15 February to 31 March and a night curfew from April 1. Testing was also ramped up, from merely 5,000 to now around 15,000 testing every day. Unfortunately, even after growing positive cases, there is still a sizable segment in Nagpur city population are not wearing mask in public. According to Dr Vijay Joshi, a senior doctor of local civic body and the coordinator of private and government hospitals for the Covid-19 patients in Nagpur said that lack of awareness among people is a challenge, as they don’t understand the seriousness of the virus. “Initially there was even hesitancy towards Covid-19 vaccine, but now people are coming for it,” says Dr Joshi and claimed that as many as 3, 67,476 people of Nagpur city were vaccinated till Monday evening. Amidst a massive spurt in Covid cases in Nagpur, testing has tripled to around 15,000 tests per day, according to the guardian minister for Nagpur district, Nitin Raut. As many as 1,322,892 people were tested so far. He said there are 2,991 oxygen beds, 1413 ICU and 532 ventilator beds available for Covid-19 patients in Nagpur city. However, this could not prevent the surge of the deadly disease. The increased testing might be another possible reason why more cases are being reported in Nagpur district, says Ravindra Thakare, the district collector. Chilkar said that there are over 57,819 active cases in Nagpur and of them 80% patients are asymptomatic. “In view of the present situation, we only recommend 20% mild and moderate patients to the hospitals. It is indeed a challenge as we have only 4,441 Covid beds (including from the private hospitals) in Nagpur city,” he said and claimed that the government is increasing the capacity in view of the growing situation. The state government already sanctioned ₹65-crore to tackle the outbreak in Nagpur. This amount will be used to increase beds, add more ICU beds, ventilators and provide more infrastructures in government-run hospitals at Nagpur. Meanwhile, authorities have imposed protocols for the second wave to ensure better surveillance. For instance, the authorities did away with strict home isolation for the first seven days and another seven days home quarantine after one test positive. However, the earlier protocols were stricter than the new one. During the first wave, there were strict hospitalisations (even for the asymptotic patient) for 14 days and another 14 days for home quarantine, said Chilkar. Asymptomatic to moderate cases are now sent to two designated Covid care centres. There are 138 Covid hospitals in Nagpur city. The more severe cases are sent to government-run medical college hospitals or civic hospitals for treatment. The locals, however, say the authorities of not doing enough to contain the outbreak. Mohan Kothekar, a rights activist, blames the authorities for not doing enough to prevent the infections from recurring. There was no sticker at homes of infected patients which were mandatory during the first wave last year. Kothekar, who resides in an apartment on Amravati Road in west Nagpur locality pointed out that in his apartment at least four to five families with couples and children were found positives, but the civic body didn’t put a sticker at their homes to alert the neighbours. Children and elders from their family, who had tested positive, were also moving about freely. A new variant of Sars-Cov-2 was detected in random community samples from Nagpur, the Union government said earlier this month. The Union health ministry said a novel variant with a combination of two mutations E484Q and L452R was found in 206 samples taken from state since December. “We sent swab samples of few patients to the National Institute of Virology at Pune a few days ago and the reports established the new strain of coronavirus,” Raut said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/nagpur-hospitals-discharge-patients-early-to-admit-others-101618340982860.html
14-04-2021||Chandigarh||Harsimrat making political hay from Covid crisis: CM||Chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Tuesday accused SAD MP and former Union minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal of insensitive attempts to make political hay from the current Covid crisis in the state. In a statement, Amarinder said the Akali leader was in the habit of lying, even on the most sensitive of subjects, especially at a time when the unrelenting efforts of the state’s healthcare workers were showing some positive results. “Her comments on the Covid situation have exposed a new low,” said the chief minister, slamming the former Union minister for playing dirty political games on the issue of the pandemic. Harsimrat had on Monday slammed the state government over “shortcomings” in Covid management. Responding to her remarks, the CM said instead of choosing to support his government’s concerted efforts, which had led to some bright spots on the Covid front, Harsimrat, along with the rest of her party colleagues, including SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal, had been continuously indulging in cheap criticism of his government on the management of the pandemic. Pointing out that the state’s medical community was working day and night to fight the pandemic, Amarinder said the untiring efforts of the medical fraternity had led to some improvement in the situation over the past few days, with Punjab no longer among the top five states contributing the maximum case load. While Punjab was still a long way from victory in the battle against Covid, this was a matter of optimism, and a cause for appreciation of all the frontline workers who were working hard for the past over one year, he noted. “Does she not realise how such statements are de-motivating for the frontline workers, and all the people of Punjab? Or does she simply not care, because her entire focus is on finding excuses to pull down my government?” he asked. The CM also lashed out at Harsimrat for finding fault with the ban on political gatherings in the state. While the Congress had voluntarily decided to put off all rallies and gatherings, the Akalis, led by Sukhbir himself, were spreading mayhem by proudly holding such rallies without masks and social distancing of any kind, he alleged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/harsimrat-making-political-hay-from-covid-crisis-cm-101618340922866.html

The technical advisory committee has suggested that positive cases will increase till May 2. Hence, people must abide by Covid appropriate behaviour,” he said. He further clarified that the Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) has not recommended any lockdown. “I’m part of the TAC. No one has recommended a lockdown,” Yediyurappa said. “Currently, there is no proposal to impose a lockdown. We will wait and watch the situation for a week,” the CM said while speaking to the media in Bidar district. “We are hoping that the situation will be under control within a week. After monitoring the situation, we will take a call on the tough measures to be implemented to contain the spread of the virus,” he said. A member of the Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) on the condition of anonymity said that May 2 was one of the projections given by the TAC. “During our meetings, based on the information available, we had told the government that the spike could continue till May 2. However, we had reworked these estimates and told the chief minister that the spike could continue till the end of May,” said the expert. “People have to cooperate by wearing masks, maintaining hand hygiene and physical distancing. There is no other way.. With folded hands, I want to ask the people to cooperate,” Yediyurappa said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/karnataka-cm-calls-for-all-party-meet-on-april-18-rules-out-lockdown-101618340862269.html

As many as 1,16,954 regular students and 14,931 open school students appeared for the Class-10 examination while 1,00,982 regular students and 13,944 open school candidates appeared for the examination. The examinations will conclude on April 28 for Class 10 and May 10 for Class 12. The board’s chairperson Suresh Kumar Soni said 2,137 examination centres had been set up across the state.Separate dates for infected students Soni said the examinations were being conducted in compliance with Covid guidelines. “Separate provisions have been made for students with flu-like symptoms. Infected students can appear for the examination after a month and dates for the same will be announced later,” he said. Should a teacher at the examination centre test positive, staff from other schools will be deputed at the centre. Those in boarding schools at greater risk Students putting up at boarding schools are at a greater risk as evidenced by 18 students testing positive at Pine Grove, a well-known boarding school in Dharampur, Solan. Four cooks, and teachers have also tested positive for the virus. School authorities, however, remain tight-lipped despite attempts to reach them for a comment. The boarders tested positive a week after 120 students at Dalhousie Public School tested positive. Students from a school in Barotiwala have also tested positive for the virus. With students increasingly contracting the virus, the district administrations have taken fresh measures and are maintaining a close tab on the residential schools. Solan and Shimla have the highest number of residential schools. The managements of residential schools have asked parents to furnish reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) negative reports before admitting students.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/amid-covid-surge-2-lakh-students-appear-for-annual-exam-in-hp-101618340684615.html
14-04-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai’s health infrastructure falls short as patients go after private medical care||The spread of Covid-19 disease among the city’s wealthier residents of high rises — at least 799 buildings are now sealed by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation as of April 12 — is driving the shortage of private hospital beds in Mumbai. This shift in the socio-economic pattern of the pandemic has once again left Mumbai struggling to cope, as it did during the first wave. Bandra’s tony Lilavati Hospital in Bandra added 25 beds in the lobby of its Covid-19 floor last month, but it’s still not enough, chief executive officer Dr V Ravishankhar said. “Patients know that once they are in, their treatment will start and they will be moved to a bed as soon as someone is discharged,” Ravishankar said. “It gets tough when patients have specific demands of private beds or deluxe rooms.” At any given point, at least eight Covid-19 patients are being treated in the triage area – the first point of contact with a patient. After the last peak settled down in November, many beds were reassigned for non-Covid care. But as soon as the cases surged, they went back to the Covid-19 arrangement. Currently, the hospital has 142 regular beds and 48 Intensive Care Unit beds for Covid-19 cases. According to Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani, a shortage of beds is being felt in the private sector particularly as “a large number of patients are now coming from housing complexes and high rises.” The situation in public-run hospitals isn’t as yet dire, but the number of vacant beds is fast reducing. As of April 12, as many as 15,451 beds were occupied out of the 19,329 Covid-19 beds under the BMC’s command (13,512 in public hospitals and 5817 in private hospitals). Of the vacant beds, only 588 were in private hospitals. The city has 89 ICU beds available (out of a total of 2,529) and 32 ventilators available (out of a total of 1302). Mumbai has recorded over 5,20,214 cases and 12,017 deaths to date. Last year, the city’s highest single-day surge during the first wave was 2848 cases on October 7, 2020. This year, the highest single-day count touched 11,302 on April 4. A serological prevalence study carried out by the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research along with the BMC in July 2020 had revealed that 57% of the slum population and 16% of the non-slum population were infected by the coronaviruS. A second round of the study in August also showed a higher prevalence of 44.9% in slums and 17.5% prevalence in the non-slum population. The surveys marked an important trend—those living in high rises had escaped the first wave of the pandemic. SHORTAGE OF BEDS Last year, as the pandemic raged, the civic body created additional health infrastructure in the form of jumbo Covid-19 facilities in large areas. The first such facility opened inside the dome stadium of the National Sports Club of India in Worli in March 2020. Other such jumbo facilities were started in Bandra Kurla Complex, Byculla, Goregaon, Dahisar, and Mulund, at a breakneck speed. When the cases started declining in November, these big facilities were mostly lying vacant but the infrastructure was retained for vaccination drives and a second wave which was anticipated in December-January. The facility at Mahalaxmi was dismantled, and now the corporation wants to put that facility back up. “We retained all new infrastructure that was developed for Covid-19, which is why we have been able to cater to a large number of patients in the second wave,” Kakani said. According to him, the number of hospital beds, including ICU and oxygenated beds is 1.5 times more than what the city had during the first wave. “In the jumbo facilities too, the number of beds has been increased. For example, the BKC facility has upgraded to 2000 beds from the earlier 1000, and Goregaon facility has gone up to 1600 from 1100 beds,” he said. The civic body also plans to open three more jumbo facilities with 300 beds each. “We have identified larges spaces in the western and eastern suburbs and one in the city. We will start with 300 beds and increase the capacity as per the need,” Kakani said. The possible locations earmarked are Malad, Kanjurmarg, and Sion. GOVT SHORTSIGHTEDNESS The high demand for private beds stems from multiple reasons like the lack of hygiene, upkeep, and the overall negative perception about the public-run healthcare facilities, experts said. Civic commissioner Iqbal Chahal has appealed to the citizens to not be picky while choosing beds but the civic body definitely needs to do much more to instill confidence in their facilities. “The second wave was almost two months later than we anticipated. The government had enough and more time to work various aspects on hygiene and upkeep of these facilities and upgrade them based on the feedback or complaints of patients,” said health activist Dr Abhijit More. In the first wave, social media was replete with accounts of people who had faced a difficult time accessing civic facilities, whether of beds or ambulances that arrived on time. Recently, a 38-year-old academician who was admitted to the BKC jumbo facility shared his experience on Twitter last week, and wrote about the dirty sheets, unclean toilets, and the high summer temperatures which made his recovery period difficult. In another instance, a 59-year-old social worker from South Mumbai was unable to find an oxygen bed for his 56-year-old wife last week. Eventually he found one in the civic-run Nair hospital. But when he received a call from Bombay Hospital, a private facility, about the availability of a bed, he decided to shift his wife within an hour of admission. “There was no doctor to communicate with us. When we reached there, I took my wife on a stretcher all the way to the fifth-floor ward. Once there, I had to chase a nurse to shift her on the bed and connect her oxygen. Then I was asked to get an X-Ray done and I had to again shift her on a stretcher and take her to the diagnostics sections. There was no help available. It was simply impossible to believe that my wife would get any treatment or attention,” the social worker who did not wish to be named said. “When I got a call from Bombay Hospital, I immediately decided to shift her out,” he said adding his wife’s condition has now improved and her oxygen saturation has gone up to 93%. Nair Hospital’s dean Dr Ramesh Bharmal, however, said that they had enough staff members. “We have recruited 150 multi-purpose workers and are also in the process of recruiting more AYUSH doctors. Our hospital also has vacant oxygen beds. Only the ICU beds are currently full. Some doctors were away for their examinations, but they have joined back work from April 1,” he said. According to More, Mumbai is facing a shortage of healthcare workers because those hired on contract during the first wave were not given renewals. “A lot of doctors who were hired on the contract were let go after the cases decreased. A good healthcare system cannot run on short contracts. One had to have a good number of doctors and an additional reserve as a backup. Need-based hiring of doctors puts lives at risk. I have heard the Mumbai and Pune corporations have let go of anywhere between 200 to 300 doctors,” he said. It is as yet unclear how many doctors were hired by the civic body, during the first wave, on contract, as well as during the current second wave.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbais-health-infrastructure-falls-short-as-patients-go-after-private-medical-care-101618340683425.html

14-04-2021||Mumbai||Thane battles shortage of Covid beds, again||On April 2, 43-year-old Saji Nair, a resident of Majiwada, redialled the number of the Thane Municipal Corporation’s war room – the nodal office where callers who wish to register for a bed in a Covid hospital are directed to their respective area’s medical officer to initiate the procedure – but like the previous 15 times, he didn’t get through. He cut the call, and then dialled the number of a private hospital close to his Majiwada residence in Thane. No answer. The previous private hospitals that he had reached out to did not have any bed available. Finally, his family physician Dr P C Kulkarni called him to visit Fortis hospital in Mulund. Nair, who had tested positive for Covid-19 a week before, finally found a bed and got himself admitted. “I had a fever and a lot of weakness as well, I needed constant care. My aged parents stay with me and home quarantine would have meant putting their lives at risk,” Nair said. Even as Thane has seen 16,409 cases in the first 10 days of April, more than 400 patients are currently admitted outside the city. The city has 4,499 beds available. As of April 10, the number of patients admitted in hospitals in Thane were 3,372, and only 383 Oxygen and 79 ICU beds were still free. Thane is one of the four big urban centres that is driving Maharashtra’s second wave: together with Mumbai, Pune, and Nagpur, they accounted for 59% of Maharashtra’s cases in the first four days of April. Thane, in particular, has seen a particularly steep rise to a total of 95,737 cases till now. After a fall in daily caseload from the first week of November to 120 to 150, which further decreased to less than 100 by January and all the way up to mid-February, cases began to spike again. In Mid-March, the daily caseload averaged around 500 and on April 3, the caseload was three times that number. In the first week of February, the doubling rate was 300; now it’s 42 days. However, in the same time period, the number of tests conducted daily have gone from 6500 to 10,450. All the same, overstrained healthcare infrastructure is not a new story. The first wave saw a similar situation unfold, when in June 2020 – at the time that the state’s caseload had begun to ascend towards a peak -- the city launched its first dedicated Covid Hospital, Global Hospital which had a bed capacity of 1024. During its peak (September 17), the centre had 700 beds available. Currently, there are less than 50 beds vacant. The municipality is seeking to address the shortage. It reopened the 400-bed Covid care facility at Kausa, after shutting down operations in month of October, besides roping in a few more private hospitals as Covid hospitals. A 100-bed facililty at Vartak Nagar was opened on April 3 by the civic body. In all, Thane has 26 Covid hospitals and 2 Covid centres. “We are making additional provisions for increasing the number of beds, there are many places which we had converted to a Covid centre. We are reviving all these places and also in touch with our Covid task force team to provide medical staff support,” Sandeep Malvi, deputy municipal commissioner. “Despite the onset of the second wave there were no proper restrictions in the city. Delivery boys and parcel services were frequenting housing societies, as were visitors. Roadside eateries were open, people crowded outside shops blocking the footpath making it difficult for those walking along the road to follow social distancing,” said Shashikumar Nair, a city-based citizen activist. Lax behaviour, and failure to mask up and follow effective distancing is being touted as one of the main reasons for the new wave. Localities like Majiwada-Manpada and Vartak Nagar, which have the plushest residential complexes and townships, are recording more than 500 to 600 cases every day since April 4. Moreover, there is a moving population in this area as most people travel to Mumbai, Navi Mumbai and other neighbouring cities for work, often using some form of public transport. Before the new set of restrictions, including weekend lockdown, was imposed starting April 5, many housing societies had grown lax in terms of containing the spread of the virus by allowing free flow of visitors. During the first wave, TMC had not only sealed buildings but also areas within 2km radius of sealed buildings were considered containment zones. Moreover, they roped in Rapid Action force in Lokmanya- Savarkar Nagar, Wagle Estate and Mumbra wards to patrol regularly and ensure Lockdown norms are followed. Similarly, in the month of May, SRPF jawans were stationed in Mumbra.The TMC had not tightened the restrictions in hotspots or announced containment zones till April 3, when the corporation started sealing the buildings after 1482 cases were recorded on that day. The last time the city had seen such a high tally was in October 2020, when the highest daily caseload recorded was nearly half: 727. “We have announced hotspots in the city, these are clusters which have an increased number of positive cases. We have sealed 95 buildings in the city which had more than five positive Covid-19 cases since April 3. Among these, the greatest number of buildings are sealed in Diva, while not a single building was sealed in Mumbra and Wagale Estate ward. With Majiwada-Manpada ward witnessing the highest spike, the corporation has also sealed 316 floors of different buildings in this ward alone,” said Ashok Burpulle, Deputy Municipal Commissioner, TMC. There are also growing concerns of a new, double mutant strain of the virus, which has been found in samples from Maharashtra that were studied for genome sequencing by the Centre. And while more information on that is still awaited, experts said that further restrictions will help arrest the spread of the virus. What will also help is vaccination: something that wasn’t happening during the first wave. Although Thane city has 54 operational vaccination centres, only around 34 are functioning at all times as some centres are open only on alternate days. Till now, there have been 1.8 lakh vaccinations including first and booster dosages. On a daily basis initially there used to be 10,000 vaccinations from March 1 onwards but as there are fewer vaccines available since March 30, the civic body has reduced it to around 6000 to 7000 vaccines daily. “We are giving preference to those with prior booking, but we ensure that the crowd is managed well and in case a particular centre has a greater number of people we contact the nearest vaccine centre and divert the crowd,” Malvi said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/thane-battles-shortage-of-covid-beds-again-101618340385641.html

In a letter to DG , medical health Dr DS Negi and CMO, Lucknow, Dr Sanjay Bhatnagar, additional chief secretary, health and family welfare, Amit Mohan Prasad said four times more Covid cases were being reported during the second wave in the city in comparison to the first wave, yet all the Covid hospitals had not been made functional. The ACS has directed both the officers to submit report on the issue. In a separate order, Prasad warned of action against private laboratories and hospitals for charging more fees from the people than the rate fixed by the state government. Action would be taken under UP Public Health and Epidemic Act-2020 against the defaulting private hospitals and laboratories, he said. Prasad said the treatment and sample test was free in the government hospitals and laboratories. In an order issued by the state government, the private laboratories’ rate has been fixed ₹700 per test for the patients visiting the laboratories whereas ₹900 would be charged for collection of the sample from home, he said. The rate for the private hospitals has been also fixed- ₹10,000 per day for moderate sickness (isolation bed with oxygen support) in NABH accredited hospitals and ₹8,000 in non-NABH hospitals, For severe sickness (ICU without ventilator) ₹15,000 per day in NABH accredited hospital and ₹13,000 in non-accredited hospitals. For very severe sickness (ICU with ventilator) the rate was ₹18,000 in the accredited hospitals and ₹15,000 per day in the non-accredited hospitals, he said. Some private hospitals were charging extra fees from the patients for consultancy, nursing care and monitoring visit which was against the order of the state government. The use of Remdesivir injections, RT-PCR tests and IL-6 tests were not included in the package, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/acs-seeks-report-on-delay-in-test-reports-101618340202177.html
14-04-2021||Other||With finger pointed at Haryana, Chadha says get ready for water shortage||New Delhi: Delhi Jal Board (DJB) vice-chairperson Raghav Chadha said that large parts of Delhi are likely to witness a shortage of water starting Wednesday as Haryana, in violation of the Supreme Court guidelines, is reportedly sharing lower than the mandated share of Yamuna water with Delhi, and has failed to adhere to safe pollution levels.Chadha, who is also an MLA from the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), called it “criminal negligence” and accused the Haryana government of affecting the Right to Life of Delhi residents. “Haryana government is deliberately trying to play with the lives of people by supplying polluted water that is untreatable by world-class treatment plants. The Haryana government must wake up, and not play with the lives of the people of Delhi. We demand that the Haryana government must supply water (from Yamuna) that it is legally designated to (Delhi), by the Supreme Court, and within the range of treatable PPM (parts per million),” Chadha said on Tuesday. Addressing a press conference, Chadha said that water supply will be “severely hit” in parts of central, south and west Delhi on Wednesday as the treatment capacity of three water treatment plants in the Capital—Wazirabad, Okhla and Chandrawal — were affected by inadequate water supply from Haryana. The situation is also worsened by the high levels of ammonia in the Yamuna water, he said.Among the areas that will experience water shortage no Wednesday are Vijay Nagar, Timarpur, Khyber Pass, Old Secretariat, Civil Lines, Lahori Gate, Old Sabzi Mandi, Naya Bazaar, Peeli Kothi, Malka Ganj, Motia Khan, Jhandewalan, Baraf Khana, Patparganj, Pusa Road, Rajinder Nagar, Karol Bagh, Central Secretariat, Parliament House and President House. Supply will also be hit at Vigyan Bhawan, Rakab Ganj, India Gate, Janpath, North Avenue, East Patel Nagar, New Patel Nagar, South Patel Nagar, Cantonment, RK Puram, Vasant Vihar, Akbar Road, Sarojini Nagar, Kalkaji Tughlaqabad, Giri Nagar, Lodhi Colony and Defence Colony. Chadha said that on Tuesday, water production in Chandrawal has dropped from 92 MGD (million gallons per day) to 71 MGD, and in Okhla from 21 MGD to 10 MGD. “In total, 85 MGD of the water supply has been reduced due to the trouble created by Haryana,” he saidDJB officials said that water treatment plants can treat only up to 1PPM of water. PPM is the mass of a chemical or contaminant per unit volume of water. According to DJB’s recording at 4pm on Tuesday, the PPM level reached an average 7.6 across all water treatment plants.. “The amount of pond-level water that should be maintained by Haryana should be 674 feet. Today (Tuesday), it is just 670 feet. And, it should be known that even if it is reduced to 0.1 feet, it can jeopardise the water supply,” Chadha said. Yamuna is one of the primary sources of water for the national capital, constituting nearly 40% of the water produced and supplied to the homes in Delhi. This is not the first time that the DJB vice-chairperson has accused the Haryana government of sending highly polluted water to the Delhi side, and not transferring the prescribed water for Delhi. In January, the Supreme Court had also issued a notice to the Haryana government over high pollution levels in the Yamuna after DJB alleged that water containing high ammonia levels was being released into the river from the neighbouring state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/with-finger-pointed-at-haryana-chadha-says-get-ready-for-water-shortage-101618340142189.html
14-04-2021||Delhi||In 2020, DFS recorded least emergency calls, most deaths||While 2020 marked the least number of emergency calls received by the Delhi Fire Services in the last five years, data released by the fire department on Tuesday showed that it handled the most human casualties caused by fire, building collapse, hanging and drowning during the same period.According to the DFS data, the fire control room received 25,709 emergency calls related to fire, building collapse, bird rescue, suicides, and drowning, in 2020, or an average of around 71 such calls each day. Between 2016 and 2020, most calls were received in 2018 (31,264 calls), followed by 2019 (31,157 calls).DFS data showed that the city witnessed most number of deaths -- 346 -- in these incidents in 2020, 38 more than in 2019. The second highest was in 2017, when 318 people lost their lives in different incidents.“Nearly 70 people out of 346 died in fire incidents. The remaining people died by suicide, drowning, or building collapse. The calls were responded to by firefighters and rescue teams posted at 64 fire stations across the city. There were two serious fire and 19 medium fire incidents reported in Delhi last year,” said DFS chief Atul Garg.DFS and other fire departments across the country will observe the annual “Fire Service Week” from Wednesday by paying homage to 66 fire fighters and officers of the Mumbai Fire Brigade who lost their lives during a fire fighting operation in a ship “Fort Stikine” in 1944, Delhi fire department officials said.Garg said that the fire service week -- the theme for which is “Maintenance of Fire Safety Equipment is key to Mitigate Fire Hazards” -- will also see a wreath laying ceremony at Rohini’s Fire Safety Management Academy, followed by a series of events throughout the week.“The major emphasis during the fire service week shall be to propagate the theme and to generate fire safety awareness in the society through a series of lectures, demonstrations and group discussions. Offices, markets, schools and JJ clusters at prominent places have been specifically selected for lectures and demonstrations,” he added.In a statement released on Tuesday, DFS said that a proposal for filling of 706 posts of fire operators have been sent to Delhi Subordinate Services Selection Board (DSSSB) and the recruitment process has been started. A total of 32 radio telephone operators have also been recruited and are likely to join the department soon.To improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the fire service response, the department has procured more vehicles and equipments, which are undergoing registration with transport authorities, the statement said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/dfsrecorded-least-emergency-calls-most-casualties-in-2020-101618340082771.html

He, however, added that he will seek instructions on the queries posed by the court.The court also sought to know whether the computers in the computer centre in Tihar Jail can be made operational for prisoners to access the websites of Delhi Police, trial courts, Delhi high court and the Supreme Court, so that they can keep track of their cases and FIRs against them.It also asked the DG Prisons to consider providing more computers with Internet connection in the legal aid room of the jail, so that lawyers can help prisoners find out their case status and also draft pleas.The queries were posed to DG Prisons after being raised before the court by two JNU students — Natasha Narwal and Devangana Kalita — who are in jail in connection with the communal riots in north east Delhi.Narwal and Kalita, arrested last year in May and in judicial custody presently, had sought a direction to the DG Prisons to allow them and other inmates to have a choice of in-person or virtual meetings to communicate with family and friends as is provided under the Prison Rules of 2018.The two students were arrested by the Crime Branch of the Delhi Police and booked under various sections of the Indian Penal Code and the stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act for their alleged role in conspiring to orchestrate the riots.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/court-asks-tihar-if-they-can-restart-in-person-meeting-of-prisoners-with-family-101618340022754.html
14-04-2021||Delhi||Delhi HC pulls up AAP MLA, says hearing to reopen Markaz is still in progress||The Delhi high court on Tuesday pulled up AAP MLA and Delhi Waqf Board chairman Amanatullah Khan for his comments regarding the reopening of the Markaz building in Nizamuddin for the public. The court also declined a request to permit 50 people to offer prayers on the first day of Ramzan, and instead allowed five nominees to enter the premises.The judge expressed displeasure over a statement given to the media by Khan, who said the court has allowed the mosque to be made operational.Justice Mukta Gupta termed Khan’s statement “unfortunate” and said that it has not ordered the reopening of the Markaz building in south-east Delhi which was sealed on March 31 last year after the alleged violation of the Covid-19 guidelines at Tablighi Jamaat meetings.“It is unfortunate that despite the fact that the writ is yet to be decided and this court has not passed any order in re-opening the mosque, Amanatullah Khan...has made a statement stating that the court has opened the mosque,” the court noted in its order.Solicitor General (SG) Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Centre, told the court that on Monday, Khan pressured police personnel present during an inspection to open the entire premises. He also said Khan had misrepresented the court’s order of April 12 as a de-sealing order. “He also released a misleading video, wherein he has claimed credit for getting the Markaz mosque, comprising seven floors, opened,” he said, adding that the legislator also released a video claiming that the building has been de-sealed.The court was hearing a plea by the Delhi Waqf Board seeking the opening of the Markaz.On Tuesday, the court also declined the prayer of senior counsel Ramesh Gupta, appearing for the board, for re-opening the mosque for 50 people to offer prayers on the first day of Ramzan, saying it cannot issue any direction without seeing what the Centre says in its affidavit. “...once the court allows, controlling the number will be difficult,” said justice Gupta, adding that she would “see” it on April 15, the next date of hearing. The court allowed five nominated persons to offer prayers, as submitted by the Centre. SG Mehta, along with advocate Rajat Nair, also representing Delhi Police, opposed the prayer and told the court that according to an April 10 order of the Delhi Disaster Management Authority, all gatherings, including political, social, religious or any other congregation, are prohibited in the city.Mehta also said that the last time the court had ordered re-opening of the mosque on Shab-e-Baraat, over 500 people had gathered though the court only allowed 50 people.Senior advocate Ramesh Gupta, representing the board, however, disputed the claim. He also said that religious congregations are being allowed while stating that 3.5 million people took a dip in the Ganga during the Kumbh Festival. Mehta said that he would submit any video of that day if it is available.The Centre on March 24 told the Delhi high court that 50 people chosen by the state waqf board and whose names are given to the local police station can be permitted to offer prayers at the mosque in the Nizamuddin Markaz on the Shab-e-Barat.Meanwhile, the court asked the Centre to file an affidavit as to whether the DDMA order was being implemented across the board. The court also asked authorities to file a response to the plan submitted by Delhi Waqf Board for holding prayers during the month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/aapmla-pulled-up-for-comments-on-markaz-reopening-101618340022242.html

During questioning, police said he revealed that the three accused had taken a room on rent in outer Delhi’s Shahbad Dairy for the last one month to avoid a UP Police drive to arrest habitual criminals ahead of approaching gram panchayat elections.“Verma has revealed that a relative of one of the two absconding suspects is also contesting the pradhan elections in his village. His purpose behind committing the robbery was to arrange money for the candidate’s election campaign expenditures. Verma’s disclosure will be verified when we arrest the suspect,” said an investigating officer, who did not want to be identified.Around 1 pm on April 6, Krishan Kumar, a fruit vendor from Azadpur fruits and vegetables market, was walking towards a private bank to deposit ₹3.90 lakh when two men wearing masks allegedly pointed a gun and asked him to hand over his cashbag. Kumar was allegedly shot on his left arm when he resisted the robbery. The duo allegedly snatched the bag and fled on a bike with their third associate, police said.Deputy commissioner of police (northwest) Usha Rangnani said that a case was registered and multiple teams were tasked to nab the suspects. The special staff team scanned the CCTV cameras installed on the routes that the suspects took while fleeing. The video footage showed that after a few hundred metres, two suspects got down from the bike and got on an e-rickshaw.“We followed the trail and found the bike abandoned in Jahangirpuri area. The suspect who rode the bike at the time of the crime was identified as Surender Verma. Through electronic surveillance, Verma’s location was found in Gonda, from where he was arrested,” said Rangnani, adding that Verma purchased a mobile phone worth ₹10,000 from the ₹30,000 he received as his share of the loot. During questioning, the DCP said Verma, who was previously booked in four cases, including under the Gangster Act in Gonda, revealed that a majority of the loot and the pistol used in the crime is in the possession of his associate, Jitender Maurya, who was earlier involved in seven crimes in Gonda.“Maurya deposited ₹2 lakh in his bank account. We have seized the account and are making efforts to arrest him and the third suspect, Abhishek Verma,” added the DCP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/man-held-for-shooting-at-robbing-fruit-vendor-search-on-two-others-101618339963269.html
14-04-2021||Other||Industrial areas ask for vaccination for workers in the area||New Delhi: Industrial area bodies in the city have requested district administrations to set up vaccination centres or camps for their workers, arguing that the move will help firm owners ease the inoculation process for their staffers.The Centre last week allowed government and private workplaces to set up vaccination centres on campus in a bid to ramp up inoculations.The Narela Industrial Complex Welfare Association (NICWA), wrote to the northwest Delhi district administration on April 8 in this regard. Ashish Garg, general secretary of the association, said the 4,000-odd units there employed close to 200,000 employees.Garg said, “If the government agrees, we can help them set up vaccination centres here. We can also mobilise workers who meet the criteria for vaccination. At a time when cases are increasing, it is important that our employees get jabs for free as they are struggling to make ends meet and can’t afford to go to private hospitals. We are yet to hear from the district administration.”He added, “The medical facility where vaccines are available is a bit far away from our industrial areas. Workers are reluctant to visit hospitals mainly because they don’t want to lose out on the daily wages. If there is a centre here, workers will not have to lose out on day’s work and will also get motivated seeing others getting the vaccine.”A senior district official with North West Delhi said, “The matter was raised last week in a meeting with Delhi government’s chief secretary. But no decision has been taken on this so far. Currently, we have made special arrangements to take people from industrial areas and villages who meet the criteria to the centres for vaccination. We have put four or five vehicles in services just for this.”In Udyog Nagar industrial area near Paschim Vihar in West Delhi, the industry association has a medical facility that stakeholders say can be used as vaccination hub. Ashok Gupta, president of the association said, “We have close to 20,000 workers in our industrial area. We have been requesting the district administration to use our centre. We were hoping that our centre would be used during the Tika Utsav. It is important to ensure that labourers are vaccinated,” said Gupta.Industrial associations said business has only recently started to pick up, even though it is not at the same level as it was before Covid. With the increase in the number of Covid-19 cases once again, industry owners fear reverse migration and want to provide facilities to workers.“A majority of people working in industrial areas are migrant workers. Last year, they all left for their villages during the lockdown. We don’t want a situation like that again. If they take care of them now by providing facilities such as vaccinations near their workplace, we can avert such a situation,” said Vijay Virmani, president of Delhi manufacturers Federation (which has 24 industrial area associations as members).Virmani added, “The labourers are reluctant because they feel they will lose out an entire day’s wages if they travel to a vaccination centre. We are planning to write to the Delhi government to request them to allow vaccinations in all industrial areas.”A senior Delhi government’s revenue department official said, “We are doing institution based vaccination. Opening vaccination centres in industrial areas will help in vaccinating a large population. But the health department has to take a call on it.”Delhi government spokespersons did not respond to requests for comment||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/industrial-areas-ask-for-vaccination-for-workers-in-the-area-101618339903963.html

So it won’t affect the fasting. Muslims should not delay and get themselves vaccinated even in the month of fasting,” stated the fatwa issued by ICI, Lucknow. Maulana Khalid Rasheed Farangi Mahali, Imam Eidgah and chairman ICI, said the fatwa was issued after a person named Abdursheed Kidwai of Bhopal asked the Darul-Ifta that during the pandemic, when Covid19 vaccine was being administered, was it ‘halal’ (permitted) to get vaccinated or ‘haram’ (not permitted) in Islam. The caller who called on the helpline had also asked if taking vaccine would affect the fast. He said the fatwa department not only clear his doubt but also issued a fatwa, stating that it won’t affect fasting during Ramzan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/vaccination-permissible-during-ramzan-fast-ici-101618339902672.html

Senior officials of the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) said these measures included shutting entry gates for crowd management inside stations, to increasing the number of flying squads to check violations inside trains, over the last fortnight, strict enforcement of Covid appropriate behaviour is being ensured. “We are closely monitoring the situation. Flying squads are regularly inspecting trains and stations to ensure Covid protocols are followed. Passengers are being penalised and counselled. We are also shutting entry to stations temporarily to ensure there is no crowding,” said Anuj Dayal, executive director (corporate communications), DMRC. DMRC on Tuesday closed off entry to at least seven metro stations temporarily at various points. These stations included, Saket, Qutub Minar, New Delhi, Chandni Chowk, Kashmere Gate, Seelampur and Shastri Park. Apart from the entry restrictions, DMRC has also intensified penalising passengers found travelling without masks. DMRC data shows that between April 1 and April 12, 6755 commuters were prosecuted for not wearing masks inside the Metro stations and inside trains. Metro officials confirmed that while such a plan to close off entry to stations for crowd management inside stations was announced when the network was opened for public after a five-month-long lockdown on September 7 last year this was implemented on-ground only from April 6 this year, when the number of infections in the city started increasing again. On Tuesday, Delhi reported xx cases of Covid-19 infections, the highest single day numbers to ever be recorded since the pandemic broke out (to confirm after the numbers are released. On Monday, Delhi reported 11, 491 cases and 72 deaths. On April 6, entry was restricted at four stations, on April 8 the gates were closed off for one station, and on April 12, entry to four stations was restricted for different durations to manage the crowd inside stations. Many commuters, who were stranded outside the stations on Tuesday, said that closing of gates was leading to counterproductive results as large crowds gathered outside stations waiting to get in. Commuters complained that the wait outside stations, especially the interchange stations such as Kashmere Gate and New Delhi, was as much as 45 minutes. “What are they gaining by closing off entry? Crowds have been gathering outside because of this unannounced closure. If they allow people to go, there will be smooth movement and no crowding,” said Sudha Sriniwas, a commuter who was waiting outside Kashmere Gate. Metro officials, however, said that it was imperative that all the precautions are followed to the T at this time to ensure that the Metro does not have to face another shutdown. “We are conducting regular meetings with the centre and Delhi government representatives to give updates of our safety protocol. It is imperative that a mass transit network like the Delhi Metro follow all precautions. This has been a first experience for us but we have been doing a good job and ensuring that the Covid protocol is thoroughly maintained,” said a senior DMRC official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/as-cases-rise-metro-amps-up-checks-to-limit-crowds-enforce-covid-protocols-101618339782182.html
14-04-2021||Delhi||DU admission process to get delayed again this year due to Covid-19||Admissions to colleges in Delhi University are likely to be delayed by a few months due to the second Covid-19 wave raging across the country, officials involved in the process said on Tuesday.Officials said that the university will wait for majority of the education boards in the country to complete their Class 12 exams before starting the admission process. Last year, the registration process began in June, and the first cut-off was announced in October, due to the lockdown.The academic session, which normally begins in DU in July, began in November last year.Officials said the admission process is likely to get delayed again this year with the Covid cases rising across the country. “DU is the biggest central university in the country and students from all over the country apply here. The university is keeping a close eye on how different state boards and national education boards are planning to conduct Class 12 exams. In some states, such as Maharashtra, the state education board has postponed Class 12 board exams. We cannot exclude students from Maharashtra by deciding early admission dates. So, it is sure that the process will get delayed like last year,” said Rajeev Gupta, chairperson of DU’s admission panel.Acting vice-chancellor PC Joshi said the admission timeline is dependent on how the state and national education boards conduct their Class 12 examinations.“We have to take care of all the boards. There is still uncertainty about the CBSE exams. So, again it’s likely that the admission process will get delayed…,” he said.The Maharashtra government on Monday postponed their Class 10 and 12 board exams. There have been similar demands in other states as well in view of the spike in cases.HT reported in February that DU was planning to adopt Central Universities Common Entrance Test (CUCET) from this year for admission to various undergraduate courses. Under the new system, the test score and Class 12 marks will be considered for admission to undergraduate courses.Joshi, who is a member of a committee constituted by the Union ministry of education to recommend modalities for the CUCET, said the university is still waiting for the Centre to notify CUCET. “We are ready to implement CUCET from this year. The university has decided to give 50-50 weightage to both CUCET and Class 12 scores,” he said.DU is also likely to skip to sports and extracurricular activity trials for admissions on 5% supernumerary seats reserved for these categories in each course.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/du-admission-process-to-get-delayed-again-this-year-due-to-covid19-101618339724114.html

CBSE officials, however, said they are monitoring the situation and will take a call soon.The DCPCR letter comes hours after Delhi chief minister (CM) Arvind Kejriwal requested the Centre to cancel the board exams, citing the unprecedented surge in Covid-19 cases in the country. Delhi recorded the highest ever single day tally of “13,500 Covid-19 cases in the last 24 hours”, the CM said. Total number of fresh cases in Delhi was 13,468, according to the Delhi government health bulletin release Tuesday evening. In its letter to CBSE chairperson Manoj Ahuja, DCPCR chief Anurag Kundu said, “India is witnessing a spectacular rise in Covid-19 cases. In the past week, nearly one million people have been infected. We lost nearly 5,000 of our loved ones to the pandemic. This wave is clearly stronger and this demands that every precaution is taken to curb its spread. Nearly five lakh children are set to appear in the upcoming board examinations. This threatens not only the children’s health, but the children may act as the carrier infecting their parents and grandparents. The examination centres can become hot spots of the pandemic.”The child rights organisations also sought clarity on the board‘s plan to handle Covid-19 protocols at examination centres. “There remains a lack of clarity on how the CBSE intends to handle the cases of children whose relatives are infected. Similarly, how will the cases of those children be handled who get infected during the examination?” Kundu said in the letter.“Therefore, the DCPCR advises the CBSE to either postpone the scheduled board examinations or to reconsider the assessment criteria to focus on internal examinations,” the letter added.Delhi education minister Manish Sisodia also requested the CBSE to cancel the upcoming exams. “Looking at the rising Covid-19 cases across the country, now is the time to cancel the CBSE board examinations. When education could not be done in the traditional (offline) mode for the whole year, then why is there the stubbornness to conduct the exam in the offline mode at the end of the year? The examination centres will become super-spreaders if the exams are not cancelled,” he tweeted on Tuesday.Officials at the CBSE, meanwhile, said that they are closely monitoring the situation. “The board is keeping a close watch on how the Covid-19 pandemic situation is unfolding across the country. Some state boards have already started postponing their exams. In case of CBSE, which is the biggest national board, any decision regarding exams cannot be taken unilaterally. We are discussing the situation with the union ministries and will soon take a call if the exams need to be postponed or not,” a senior official said. “The board has to consider the Covid-19 situation across states before taking a call since CBSE cannot conduct exams in different states at different times. Besides, it’s not possible to adopt any other way of assessment or conduct exams online,” the official added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi-child-rights-body-recommends-cbse-to-postpone-board-exams-101618339723480.html

Prof Shukla said that this university was still new and there was immense potential to initiate positive changes. He also said that India had a rich history and culture. If the language-related departments of the university infused this historical legacy in the university’s curriculum, it would attract not only Indian students but also those from abroad. He also said that this university had the energy of young teachers who must come forward to prepare short term job-oriented courses suited to the demands of the digital age and make them accessible to the students through Massive Open Online Courses (MOOC) platforms. He said that the students had many sources for acquiring knowledge through the online medium and the teacher himself had the responsibility to make his mark in this digital age. He said that the real aim of education would be achieved if teachers motivated students to explore the syllabus instead of covering it. It was the responsibility of 21st century teachers to create an environment conducive to learning and try to link education with Indian diaspora and societal knowledge, he said. Through the meeting, he instructed all deans to design the courses of their faculties in accordance with the New Education Policy so that students could be provided with multiple entry and exit benefits. He also asked all teachers to prepare video lectures related to their respective subjects and share them with maximum number of students through the university’s YouTube channel. In the end, he urged all teachers to make efforts for promoting the achievements and strength of the university among more and more people through online and offline mediums. The main objective of the meeting was to bring the courses of the university in line with the New Education Policy and to offer language -related courses as a specialization, said university spokesman Tanu Dang.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/language-varsity-curriculum-to-be-revised-as-per-nep-101618339722164.html

Our three-pronged approach needs to focus on policy, technology and making the environment a mass concern. People have the power. If the environment becomes the people’s concern, then big milestones can be achieved,” said Rai, during the final day of a two-day environment roundtable with experts.The environment minister on Tuesday held the second digital roundtable conference with environment experts to come up with a “holistic strategy” to reduce air pollution in Delhi before the onset of winter this year. “Pondering on pollution [just] during the winter months, when the AQI (air quality index) is severe, is not a solution. We, therefore, require public support. A plan that can work through the year is needed, and in the coming days, we will come up with an action plan to improve Delhi’s AQI. Nobody knows till when the pandemic will rage, and it’s not feasible to wait for so long. We would like your (the public) suggestions to create a viable and effective plan for the city,” Rai said.Delhi has been battling with poor air quality, which especially worsens during winter when the pollution levels deteriorate to emergency levels. Delhi was the most polluted capital city in the world in 2020 for the third consecutive year, according to a report by IQAir, a Swiss group that ranks cities based on their air quality measured in terms of the levels of ultrafine particulate matter (PM 2.5) that can enter the organs and cause lasting damage. “Often when a crisis occurs, it (responsibility) is passed from department to department because even officers-in-charge sometimes don’t know where their jurisdiction ends and the other’s begin. Delhi faces multiple challenges and if, within these challenges, we are able to deliver, then it will be a feat worth celebrating,” Rai said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/to-tackle-air-pollution-govt-eyes-a-public-movement-101618339665906.html
14-04-2021||Chandigarh||Mohali admn scrambles to contain virus spread in Dhakoli||Authorities are sparing no effort to contain the spread of virus that has infected at least 187 people in Dhakoli, which has been converted into a containment zone. Though the decision to declare the town a containment zone drew opposition from shopkeepers, all entry and exit points were sealed and movement of vehicles was restricted on Tuesday morning. Only essential service providers were allowed to move. To ensure compliance, police have set up six nakas, where officials will be deployed in three shifts. The areas declared containment zones include Dhakoli, Peer Muchalla, Kishanpura and Ghazipur, which together have a population of about 1 lakh. “The area shares its borders with Chandigarh and Panchkula and has seen a spike in number of Covid cases. That is why it has been converted into a containment zone. We have held a meeting with councillors to create awareness among residents to co-operate with the authorities,” said SDM Kuldeep Bawa. He added that night curfew remains in force. A 24x7 control room has also been set up at Dera Bassi SDM office and people can dial 01762-528116 for assistance. Testing scaled up The authorities have increased the number of testing teams from two to 10 for door-to-door sampling and vaccination. The containment zone has been divided into 10 sections to speed up testing. “There will be 100% testing. Those testing negative will be vaccinated. Those testing positive will require isolation and will be recommended appropriate care and medical attention,” said Mohali DC Girish Dayalan. “As and when a team screens an area and it is declared safe, the containment in that particular area will be lifted. After that, micro containment zones will be created,” he added. Shopkeepers hold protest Many shopkeepers held a protest in Dhakoli against closure of shops and raised slogans against the authorities. “We have already suffered huge losses last year and with the shops being closed again, we will not be able to survive,” said Maandeep Singh, a shopkeeper. “We belong to a middle-class family, whose livelihood depends on the earnings from these small shops. If these are closed, how will we be able to ensure education of our children?” asked another protester, Sukhvir Singh. “Daily wagers will leave again. We have to pay rent and electricity bills which will not be possible if the shops remain closed,” said Devinder Singh. The shopkeepers alleged that the liquor vends were allowed to operate even during night curfew and no action was taken against them. However, SDM Bawa said, “We are allowing essential services to operate. The shopkeepers have been asked to ensure social distancing. In small shops, no more than five people will be allowed.” Man booked for violating quarantineThe police have a Dhakoli man for violating quarantine. DC Dayalan said information was received from Dhakoli CHC that a resident of Golden Apartments had tested positive on April 6, but he jumped his quarantine. A case under sections 269 and 270 of the IPC has been registered against him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/mohali-admn-scrambles-to-contain-virus-spread-in-dhakoli-101618339665317.html

With increase in the number of Covid-19 cases, BJP also demanded that the government call an all-party meeting to discuss the situation.The BJP said that the government’s decision to declare 14 private hospitals as dedicated Covid facilities shows that government hospitals are not equipped to deal with the current situation.Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta said, “The government’s Covid management system has totally collapsed and they seem totally dependent on private hospitals to tackle the situation. The treatment is very expensive in a private setup and beyond the reach of lower and middle class people. But the government is yet to implement the Centre’s Ayushman Bharat scheme.”Demanding immediate implementation of Ayushman Bharat scheme, Gupta said that deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia had said last year that it would be implemented in Delhi. Gupta said, “Almost the entire country is getting the benefit under this central government scheme and getting their Covid treatment free even in private hospitals. But in Delhi, people are not that lucky.”Gupta said, “Government schools and colleges can be used as temporary quarantine centres or hospitals.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bjp-asks-delhi-govt-to-implement-ayushman-bharat-scheme-101618339662813.html
14-04-2021||Other||Lost money to online fraudsters? Now call 155260 for quick retrieval||New DelhiDelhi Police on Tuesday said they have formally launched a helpline number that helps victims of online financial frauds get their money back quickly.The helpline — 155260 — was already operating under the Union ministry of home affairs for reporting all kinds of cyber crimes. The cyber cell of Delhi Police, in collaboration with the Union ministry of home affairs, in November last year decided to take over and enhance the capacities of the helpline on a pilot basis. The police added 10 lines to the helpline number, a move that saw tremendous response, helping at least 23 victims of frauds recover their lost money either partially or fully, said Anyesh Roy, deputy commissioner of police (cyber cell). Roy added that in total , the 23 victims so far have managed to get around ₹8.11 lakh back, of which the biggest beneficiary was a Delhi-based retired audit account officer, who managed to get back ₹98,000 that he had lost to a fraudster.“In such financial frauds, retrieval of the duped money mainly depends on how quickly the complaint is received and attended to. Hence, it was necessary to have several lines open for the helpline number so that victims do not have to wait,” said Roy.Next, the police got in touch with a host of banks, online wallet firms and payment gateways to join the system. So far, nearly 50 of them have joined.Throwing light on how the helpline works, Roy said that when a victim loses money from their account, they can call the helpline number within 24 hour with the details of bank account or e-wallet from which the money is deducted, and if possible the account in which the money was deposited.Thereafter, armed with the information, the police immediately raise the matter with the concerned banks or e-wallet firms. “Our online platform is such that the officer concerned in the banks or e-wallet firms immediately receive the transaction details on their phones and emails,” Roy said.If the stolen money has not been withdrawn from an ATM or used to make utility payment , the amount is immediately put on hold by the bank or the e-wallet firm at the police’s request. Thereafter, the money is later returned to the victim.The officer said that while victims must separately also call their banks or e-wallet firms to prevent any more deductions, calling the 155260 helpline number increases their chances of retrieving the money. The entire system, investigators said, depended mainly on how quickly the financial fraud is reported to the police.This is different from the usual police action in the sense that when an online financial fraud is reported to the local police station or even to the cyber cell, it takes at least a few hours for the complaint to be registered and the police to begin their investigation.Calling the helpline number, on the other hand, initiates the retrieval process immediately, said Roy.Police said that this is a national platform formally launched on April 1. “Rajasthan has already joined the platform. Other states too are expected to follow suit soon,” said Roy.Prakash Singh, former DGP of Uttar Pradesh, called the platform an excellent initiative with the potential of helping a large number of victims. “Even if this platform can help a fraction of the people duped of their money, a large number of victims will be helped. In a financial fraud, most victims just want their money back and this platform promises to do that,” said Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/lost-money-to-online-fraudsters-now-call-155260-for-quick-retrieval-101618339662248.html
14-04-2021||Bangalore||Karnataka records lowest case fatality rate, ground reality paints different picture||As per the government data on Covid-19, Karnataka reported the lowest Case Fatality Rate (CFR) in April 2021. CFR refers to the number of deaths reported per 100 cases and in April, so far, Karnataka’s CFR is 0.45%, in comparison to April 2020, when the CFR in the state stood at was 4.09%. Although these numbers may seem promising, the ground reality is much different. “There has been over a 100% increase in the number of deaths in the state over the last week. In Bengaluru, the percentage (increase in Covid-19 deaths) is around 150%. What is even more worrying is that young people are also losing their lives. If you look at the number of deaths reported on April 11 (Sunday), there is a 33-year-old and two 38-year-olds. This is a matter of concern,” said a member of the Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) on condition of anonymity. Between April 6 to April 12, 284 patients died in the state because of Covid-19. Out of this, 188 deaths were reported in Bengaluru. In comparison, between March 30 and April 5, the state registered 137 Covid deaths and Bengaluru reported 77 of them.The official added that matter has been taken up with health minister Dr K Sudhakar. A senior Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) official said that the number of days spent in hospital by patients before death too has been a matter of concern. Among the deaths reported in Karnataka, out of 54 deaths reported 27 patients died within 24 hours of being admitted to the hospital. “This is means most of the cases are coming to the hospital after their situation gets worse. In most cases, by the time they reach the hospital, there is very little that doctors can do. We have informed the authorities about the same,” he said. People need to test quickly and not wait for the symptoms to get worse, say experts. “The government has opened several fever clinics across the city and state for people to get tested. People should make use of them. We have asked the employees there to check all parameters of the patients who are coming for a check-up and admit those who require intensive treatment,” said Sudhakar. He added that the government will focus on accelerating the vaccination drive in the state. “We have already launched awareness campaigns to get more people to vaccinate themselves. At the same time, we are aware of the increasing cases in the state and we have ensured that 50% of beds in hospitals are made available for Covid-19 treatment,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/karnataka-records-lowest-case-fatality-rate-ground-reality-paints-different-picture-101618339122947.html
14-04-2021||Lucknow||Spreading positivity with Jerusalema Dance Challenge||The Jerusalema Dance Challenge became a global phenomenon after Angolan dance group Fenómenos do Semba created a video of South African hit song ‘Jerusalema.’ After the viral videos of Austrian airlines, Swiss Police, Redemptorist Nuns, Lucknowites too have joined the bandwagon and spreading positivity, in these tough times, through their videos and in turn challenging others. City-based Institute of Career Studies lead from the front and thereafter another educational institute Hoerner College created mesmerising videos originally created by Johannesburg-based musician and producer Master KG. “We participated in the dance challenge as it exemplified the spirit of human connectedness and positivity during the frightful Covid19 pandemic. We also took this opportunity to showcase talented students and choreographers Imran Vaquar and Manjeet Kaur. Along with the Jerusalema moves we have included Indian classical dance forms,” said ICS Career GPS founder Dr Amrita Dass. They have got 48,000 viewers on their YouTube page. The other schools are planning to join their challenge includes Chittagong Grammar School, BD, Shiv Nadar School, Faridabad, South City International School, Kolkata, St Mary’s School, Johannesburg among others, she added. Hoerner College principal Dr Mala Mehra got inspired by the challenge given by the staff of Hiranandani Hospital Staff, Mumbai. “The thought behind it was to motivate the teaching, non-teaching and support staff to have a sense of worthiness at the body of work they achieved in the face of the pandemic. To have switched from offline to online, they have come to work in such difficult circumstances. Inclusion of all in the challenge was also fun as every teacher and every worker laughed and joked while following all protocols!” she said. The video was shot by Arpit Massey and team while dance training was given by pre-primary college in-charge Heena Shukla. “The response was overwhelming as we went on the school FB bulletin, YouTube channel and practically all shared on various social media platforms,” she added. The videos are getting good views and comments. “So beautifully coordinated and choreographed. Loved the amalgamation of kathak, Bharat natyam, splits and cartwheel. Kudos to all (Sic),” wrote Neena Prakash Mathur on the video posted by Dr Dass.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/spreading-positivity-with-jerusalema-dance-challenge-101618339003942.html
14-04-2021||Other||Fraud in corona times: Fake report, fake donors and packages for testing||Fake covid-19 test reports, fake profile of plasma donors and selling of packages to get tested for Covid-19 infection are some of dirty tricks being used to extort money from people at a time when there is panic due to rising cases in Lucknow as well as other parts of the state, said police officials here on Tuesday.They said it has become a new tool for some fraudsters who are extorting and minting money in the garb of providing different medical facilities and people are inadvertently getting duped.Citing an example, a senior police official of Lucknow Commissionerate said two men identified as Shubham Gautam and Shivam Kushwaha, who had once worked with pathology, were arrested for providing fake Covid-19 test reports to people willing to procure it for travelling or other reasons.He said the two fraudsters used the fake letter pad of a city’s diagnostic centre to issue fake test reports to over 50 people and charged around ₹900 from those who wanted a preferable report—people wanted negative report to travel to other states or board a flight. Many people sought negative report to visit hospitals for treatment of other ailments, he added. The official said the two fraudsters landed in police net when the pathology owner received multiple calls from people due to delay in receiving reports. He said the duo was booked under IPC sections 188 for violating government orders, 467 for forging of documents, 468 for using forged documents for cheating purpose and 471 for using forged document as genuine.An elderly person requesting anonymity said there was an urgent need of plasma for a serious Covid-19 infected patient when he came across some profiles of plasma donors on social media.“We requested one of the plasma donors whose location was mentioned near-by Lucknow with help of some people. The person demanded charges for his travel to Lucknow to donate plasma and was paid ₹1000 through online services for it. The person did not turn up for the plasma donation and is unapproachable since then,” he emphasised and added, “It was very small amount, so the police was not reported about the incident, but such practice is quite prevalent nowadays”.Similarly, some Gomti Nagar residents alleged a private hospital was minting money from people in the name of providing a full package for the family after giving inconclusive report to people coming for testing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/fraud-in-corona-times-fake-report-fake-donors-and-packages-for-testing-101618338942154.html

The laboratories will start testing samples soon.”“To increase Covid sample testing, the state health and family welfare department has also decided to use 300 TrueNat machines installed in various districts. The state government procured the TrueNat machines last year to increase the sample testing in the districts,” he said.“After decline in the Covid cases, the machines were used for the sample testing of other diseases. The chief medical officers have been directed to use the TrueNat machines for carrying out Covid tests,” Prasad said.A health department officer said Uttar Pradesh started its fight against Covid-19 with a single laboratory at King George’s Medical University (KGMU) by testing just 72 samples on March 23 last year. “Now the state has 125 laboratories in the government sector and 104 in the private sector for the Covid sample testing. The twelve new laboratories will give thrust to the Covid sample testing,” he said.Additional chief secretary, information and MSME, Navneet Sehgal said the state was now testing over 2 lakh samples of which one lakh were RT-PCR tests. Chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Tuesday directed the state health department to conduct 1.50 lakh RT-PCR tests which is considered the gold standard of the Covid 19 testing. The CM also directed the minister in-charge of all the 75 districts to review the facilities provided to the Covid patients in meeting with the district magistrates regularly, Sehgal said.“The start of the twelve new laboratories in the backward districts will help the patients in getting the sample test fast. It will also assist the department in checking the spread of the Sars-CoV-2 infection. The state government has laboratories in all the district as well as in medical colleges,” he said. “On Monday, the laboratories tested 2.18 lakh samples of which 97,000 samples were tested with RT-PCR method, taking the total tally of the samples tested in UP to 3.71 crore,” he added.“The state health department has issued orders for the appointment of one medical officer, two non- medical scientists, three laboratories technician, one data entry operator and two laboratory assistants in each laboratory coming up in the 12 districts,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/12-new-labs-set-to-boost-covid-sample-testing-in-state-101618338762131.html

Expressing concern over the situation arising from the pandemic in Lucknow and other UP cities, UP Udyog Vyapar Mandal chief Sandeep Bansal on Sunday invited traders to comment on his Facebook page asking them to suggest as to what the government should do to deal with situation that, he said, was turning from bad to worse. “Is complete lockdown the way out?” he asked. Majority of them backed the idea of a complete lockdown to break the chain though some differed or suggested alternatives. “It is not possible to control corona without lockdown. And it should be clamped immediately right now otherwise the situation is so bad that even lockdown may not help,” said Anuj Shukla in his reply. “ “A 72-hour complete lockdown alone can help otherwise government will not be able to deal with the situation,” Mohanish Alok Trivedi added. Gaurav Jain went to the extent of suggesting a complete lockdown for a month. “One month lockdown is must under the given circumstances otherwise we will lose more lives,” he said. Lokesh Agrawal suggested 15 days’ lockdown to break the chain. Mohit Agrawal also said that complete lockdown again appeared to be the only hope under the given circumstance. Rakesh Karzdar, however, questioned the utility of lockdown. “The objective of lockdown is to stop people from mixing together. The purpose is defeated when people gather in large numbers in markets to buy essentials during the lockdown relaxation,” he argued. Anil Gupta suggested no lockdown but Covid-appropriate behaviour including masking must be enforced strictly in markets while Suresh Chandra Agrawal stressed the need for more testing under lockdown. “The administration must carry out an intensive door-to-door drive for Covid-19 testing in congested areas like Aminabad, Nakkhas, Rakabganj, Thakurganj in Lucknow with complete lockdown there till the drive ends and positive cases are identified,” he suggested. Amarnath Prajapati suggested that the government must bolster health infrastructure in hospitals rather than mull lockdown. Naveen Gupta said “Lockdown or no lockdown, it is the trading community that is to suffer most from the pandemic. The government should increase medical facilities in hospitals,” Recommending compete lockdown Bhupendra Pandey said “I support complete lockdown because we must understand the fact that you will run your business only when you stay alive.” Bansal said different traders had given different suggestions but a large number of them had suggested complete lockdown as an effective tool to defeat the virus. “We will apprise the government of traders’ views,” he said. Bansal has recently launched a campaign ‘Mask nahi, saamaan nahi’ (No mask no goods) asking traders to refuse selling goods to people who came without mask.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/majority-up-traders-not-averse-to-lockdown-to-break-covid-chain-101618338642157.html

As the word on Thackeray’s Tuesday evening appeal to the state spread, migrant workers begun to gather at Pune railway station; many of them scrambling to get a ticket for the 9pm train to Uttar Pradesh. Appealing to workers in his address Thackeray said, “These restrictions are with the aim to save lives. I request everyone to support the government in its fight against Covid.” Among those returning back to their native places were those working in industries across Pune district - hotel staff and labourers on real estate sites, even though the government has allowed industries and in-situ construction sites to operate.With Tuesday being a public holiday on account of Gudi Padwa, followed by another holiday on Wednesday because of Dr Ambedkar’s birth anniversary, many chose to board trains in large numbers at the Pune station. The station officials along with police had a hard time managing the crowd as people were desperate to go back despite having no advance booking. As workers began leaving city, Maharashtra labour minister Hasan Mushrif also asked workers not to panic as the Maharashtra government would be making arrangements for workers. “Even as government is planning to impose a lockdown, it will be of two weeks. The government is also planning to make arrangements for workers during this period. I appeal to these workers not to leave as they have a major contribution in Maharashtra’s development,” Mushrif said. An official at Pune railway station said, “Labourers who had confirmed tickets with them were allowed entry to inside the station, while the rest were sent back.” One of the workers who wanted to board a train to Lucknow was not allowed entry inside the station “My colleague got the ticket confirmed, but I could not. So I will stay back in the city for few days and then go back.” Credai Pune President Anil Pharande has appealed to construction workers not to panic and stay back at their camps. Anil Pharande said, ““There is no need to panic and even in case of a lockdown happens in future we will give you all necessary facilities for a clean, safe and healthy living. All necessary items like groceries, medicine and COVID appropriate sanitised environment will be provided to the construction workers. If needed, medical facilities and provision for isolation shall also be provided.”Many restaurants staff also started leaving the city. “My two of the cooks have already left for Konkan. We are already having cash crunch and these cooks left today. They will be back once the situation is normal,” said Sarvesh Jadhav owner of Austin40 cafehouse, Baner.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/lockdown-announcement-drives-hordes-of-migrant-labourers-to-railway-station-to-leave-pune-101618331261814.html

Many of the housing societies have tied up with Swach for collecting their segregated waste but despite the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC)’s repeated appeal to residents and patients to segregate their Covid waste, it is not happening. “Waste pickers are collecting from everyone at their risk; we are training them to handle such waste carefully. Citizens should sanitize their waste with sanitisers and hand it over once in a few days, in sealed bags and inform waste pickers that there are home quarantine patients living with them. These include masks, gloves, items contaminated with blood or body fluids should not be disposed with daily waste and must be given as biomedical waste to PMC, and we have informed waste pickers not to sort such waste for recycling,” said Harshad Barde, Swach. Waste pickers have been infected over the year, according to Barde. “Some have died but there is no confirmed knowledge of source of neither infection nor any specific case of transmission from citizens. Swach has raised support for PPE for every month since lockdown, gloves, masks, sanitisers, soaps five to six times more than the PPE received from PMC during the same period,” said Barde. “We tell citizens when we find out that they should hand it over separately. Many citizens follow the rules but there are still some who just dump their Covid medical waste without telling us. They should be more careful, protecting us is protecting other citizens of the city,” Supriya Bhadakwad, waste picker. Residents in NIBM said that the PMC van to collect Covid waste comes once a week. “The Mukadam sends a message the previous day, so that our maids collect it from that household. We have requested the patient’s family to keep the waste at home, which is actually very little. Also, in case we need, he is willing to send the vehicle again,” said Maithily Manekwad, resident of NIBM. In areas like Baner and Pashan, the PMC is not doing much to help pick up this waste. Uma Tripathi who is home quarantined said, “The PMC is not picking up garbage, we have been following up and it is only false promises from their side. Garbage is being picked up every four to five days from houses in our society and it is kept in society premises for eight to 10 days.” While the Pune ploggers resumed plogging drives after the first lockdown last year in the month of August, they were greeted with massive rise in open dumping of biomedical waste in the river body. “More than 4,000 single-use masks were collected in the last six months while plogging. This is a serious concern because people have no idea about the disposal methods of biomedical waste. I raised an online petition to demand installation of mask and biomedical waste disposal bins. That helped us raise the concern at the right forum and talk about the issue. We are advising people to avoid disposal of such waste in the open and seeking help of sanitation workers of PMC,” said Vivek Gurav, Pune ploggers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/managing-biomedical-covid-waste-a-challenge-for-swach-workers-101618330841843.html
14-04-2021||Pune||Spike in food deliveries but fall in overall restaurant business||The night curfew restrictions and norms to only allow parcel service from restaurants have been a boon for online food delivery chains as there is a huge spike in online deliveries; however, the hotel industry is still facing losses. Abbas Ali, manager of Good Luck Cafe said, “Online orders have increased but the business has been severely impacted since the April 3 restriction. People have always enjoyed dine in service at our place and many still ask us for the same, but we cannot allow due to the norms” The night curfew in Pune was imposed on February 22 and for restaurants open after 10pm only takeaway was allowed. The norms became more stringent from April 3 as only takeaway was permitted for the entire day. However, food delivery is now only allowed till 10 pm. “The online parcel delivery has increased specially between 12noon to 5pm. There was never a rush of online delivery boys outside my restaurant. From five the number has now increased to 15 orders in a day’s time,” said Rajesh Sharma of Hotel Maharashtra on Laxmi road.” An employee of Zomato on the request of anonymity said “The flow of orders coming in daytime has increased from 30 per cent to 60 per cent. One thing which has affected the order chain is delivery restrictions until 10pm. There are many people who get off work after 10pm and then they place an order. There is a huge crowd of such people in Pune and that number has fallen due to the restriction.” Sarvesh Jadhav, owner of Austin40 cafe house, said, “Now with only parcel service available, people prefer to order from nearby restaurants so even if you provide special meals, discounted rates, you won’t get orders because of the delivery time. When dine in was allowed, people often used to visit from Baner and Koregaon park at our cafe.” Laxman Naidu, a delivery boy who works with Swiggy said, “The 10pm restriction should be increased at least until 11pm. It will benefit many delivery boys. In the daytime, the orders have increased.” Swiggy spokesperson said, “With the surge in Covid cases in the city, Puneites are increasingly turning to Swiggy. We’re urging consumers to opt for no-contact delivery, while also ensuring adherence to various safety and hygiene protocols amongst our restaurant and delivery partners. This includes regular temperature checks, sanitisation and the compliance of mask usage with our AI-powered audit mechanism for our delivery partners. Swiggy is also covering the costs for the Covid-19 vaccination and RT-PCR tests of our delivery partners in the city.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/spike-in-food-deliveries-but-overall-restaurant-business-impacted-101618330421704.html

14-04-2021||Pune||PMC releases list of 30 vaccination centres offering Covaxin’s second dose||Due to reserved Covaxin stock in the city, the Pune municipal corporation (PMC) has now brought out a list of 30 dedicated Covaxin centres dedicated to providing only second Covaxin doses.On Sunday, Shivajinagar MLA Siddharth Shirole tweeted saying that there is confusion among beneficiaries who received their first dose of Covaxin in March and who are now eligible for the second dose, as they are unable to find vaccination sites. Many citizens responded to the same claiming that their parents are unaware of where to get the second shot of Covaxin. Nilesh Dhakras, whose parents had got the first shot of Covaxin, said, “The PMC must provide a list of hospitals in Pune city where Covaxin is available for second dose. We got an appointment using Cowin, only to find on the day that the hospital had Covishield doses only.” Another citizen Rahul Kumar said, “My parents have taken their first shot of Covaxin at Inlak Budhrani hospital on March 19. They are not finding any hospital nearby for the second shot of Covaxin.”Another citizen Anil Sane said, “ Many hospitals deny having stock of Covaxin, especially in Kothrud, Deccan, and Karvenagar. We are due for the second dose in a day or two.” To streamline the process of second shots of Covaxin the civic body has now announced a list of 30 hospitals which will be dedicated to giving only second shots of the Covaxin Covid vaccination. Dr Vaishali Jadhav, assistant health officer said, “We have announced this list of 30 hospitals, including both private and public, where citizens can get their second shot of Covaxin. As of now we have enough doses to last for the next few days.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pmc-releases-list-of-30-vaccination-centres-offering-covaxin-s-second-dose-101618326401563.html
14-04-2021||Pune||PMC Covid care centres near empty as patients prefer home isolation||PUNE Though the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has Covid care centres active for isolation, most citizens infected with the virus, prefer to isolate at home.PMC officer Rajendra Muthe, in charge of the PMC isolation facilities, said, “It is true that there is a poor response for isolation at the centres. PMC has the maximum number of isolation facilities in the city available at educational institutes, hostels, sports complexes and on PMC properties. We are keeping beds ready considering the second surge.”Muthe added, “If the government or local authorities take a decision to keep maximum positive patients at isolation centres, we must be prepared for it. Some people are not following Covid-appropriate norms. Despite being positive, instead of remaining in quarantine, they are coming out of their homes after three or four days.”A PMC official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said, “In the first surge, most patients were from slums. The homes are very small and there were common toilets. This time, maximum positive patients are from housing societies and apartments, and all these prefer to do home isolation or get admitted to hospital.”As per the figures issued by Pune Zilla Parishad, as of February 12, a total of 75,896 patients were in home isolation, and 23,910 in hospital isolation. The PMC official said, “Our total isolation facility has reached 8,000 beds and hardly 1,000 people are using the isolation facility.”An official statement by the PMC issued on Monday, read: “Already 1,900 beds are erected at Agricultural College, Balewadi sports complex, SNDT College on Karve road, and the Dr Bababasaheb Ambedkar hostel on Ghole road. Medical officers have been recruited at these locations.”Municipal commissioner Vikram Kumar said, “New Covid care centres are coming at the Sinhgad Institute in Vadgaon; Trinity College in Kondhwa; Aundh ITI; Fergusson College; Nikmar Institute in Balewadi; Ganesh Kala Krida Manch in Swargat; and at the Savitribai Phule Pune University. These new Covid care centres will have a capacity of 4,700 beds.PMC has already started Covid care centres at Rakshaknagar Sports complex in Kharadi; Bankar School in Hadapsar; Sant Dnyaneshwar Hostel in Yerwada; and the Gangadham Fire Brigade at Bibvewadi. The total bed capacity of these centres is 1,250 and already 589 patients are taking treatment here.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pmc-covid-care-centres-near-empty-as-patients-prefer-home-isolation-101618324841497.html
14-04-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra: 11 die amid oxygen shortage reports, kin vandalise hospitals||Angry relatives stormed two hospitals at Nalla Sopara in Maharashtra’s Palghar district on Tuesday after at least 11 Covid-19 patients died on Monday night allegedly due to oxygen shortage. The authorities, however, insisted there was no shortage.“We thought my father would recover but he died because of a lack of oxygen supply... the hospital gave us false assurances,” said Rahul Verma, whose father, Ram Babu, 52, died on Monday. He added his father had a heart disease and was admitted to the Vinayaka Hospital for seven days for Covid-19 treatment.Rajendra Kamble, a police officer, said there were deaths at the two hospitals — Vinayaka Hospital and Riddhi Vinayak Hospital — but insisted they were not due to the shortage. He added the 11 patients were in critical condition. “...the hospitals had three oxygen cylinders functional, and we are investigating the matter,” said Kamble.Earlier on Monday, an audio message of Rajiv Patil, the mayor of Palghar’s Vasai, purportedly highlighting a severe shortage of oxygen needed for patients was widely shared on social media.Patil confirmed the authenticity of the message, and appealed to the state government to solve the matter.Vasai Virar City Municipal Corporation (VVMC) health department, too, maintained the deaths had nothing to do with the oxygen shortage. Ganesh Patil,VVMC’s public relations officer, said the Vinayaka Hospital received 139 jumbo oxygen cylinders and one dura cylinder (of 28 jumbo cylinder capacity) on Sunday.Riddhi Vinayak Hospital also Sunday received around 50 jumbo cylinders and 60 on Monday, according to Ganesh Patil. A total of 110 jumbo cylinders were there for patients, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-11-die-amid-oxygen-shortage-reports-kin-vandalise-hospitals-101618310321697.html
14-04-2021||Ranchi||42-yr-old bludgeons and suffocates wife, minor daughters, their teacher||Jharkand police are on the hunt for Deepak Kumar, 42, who they say is on the run after killing his wife, two minor daughters, 10 and 15, their tuition teacher, 21, and attacking his friend’s family.The motives for the killings are not known.Investigators cited a preliminary probe and said Kumar, who works in the fire brigade of a steel factory, killed his wife and daughters by bludgeoning them with a hammer and suffocating them with a pillow after drinking liquor on Sunday night.They claim he killed the teacher in the same manner around 11am on Monday. M Tamil Vanan, Jamshedpur’s senior police superintendent, said the teacher’s half clad body with her hands tied was recovered from inside a bed box and they were awaiting a post-mortem report to know whether she was raped. Then, either between the two incidents, or after the second, he visited his father-in-law and took back jewellery worth ₹5 lakh that his wife had left with her father for safekeeping. “My daughter...kept it [jewellery] in my house in view of rampant cases of theft...” said the father-in-law.Finally, he invited his friend’s family for lunch, and attacked them.Investigators say Kumar attacked his friend and the latter’s brother-in-law with the same hammer. The friend’s wife somehow ran out and raised an alarm following which the two were rushed to hospital.The accused managed to lock his house and flee on a motorcycle. His brother-in-law and the teacher’s brother were informed about the murders. They broke the lock to enter the house , where they found four bodies.The man’s friend was battling for his life in a critical condition, said Vanan. “Forensic evidence is being collected and the motive of such gruesome killings is being investigated.” According to the police, Kumar’s mobile phone has been switched off since Monday afternoon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/man-escapes-after-killing-wife-daughters-their-teacher-in-jharkhand-101618304801092.html
14-04-2021||World||Expert blames George Floyd's death on heart rhythm problem||George Floyd died of a sudden heart rhythm problem due to his heart disease while being restrained by police, a retired forensic pathologist testified for the defense Wednesday at former Officer Derek Chauvin's murder trial, contradicting several experts who said Floyd succumbed to a lack of oxygen.Dr David Fowler, a former chief medical examiner for the state of Maryland and now a member of a consulting firm, said the fentanyl and methamphetamine in Floyd's system, and possible carbon monoxide poisoning from auto exhaust, were contributing factors. He said Floyd's heart disease included high blood pressure and narrowing of the arteries.“All of those combined to cause Mr. Floyd’s death,” he said on the second day of the defense case.Chauvin attorney Eric Nelson is trying to prove that the 19-year Minneapolis police veteran did what he was trained to do and that Floyd died because of his illegal drug use and underlying health problems.Prosecutors say Floyd died because Chauvin’s knee was pressed against Floyd’s neck or neck area for 9 1/2 minutes as the 46-year-old Black man lay pinned to the pavement on his stomach last May, his hands cuffed behind his back.Nelson asked Fowler about Floyd’s narrowed arteries, enlarged heart, use of methamphetamine, the stress of the situation he was in, his high blood pressure and other factors. Fowler said all of them could have caused Floyd’s heart to work harder and led it to suddenly stop.Previous witnesses have noted that a sudden heart rhythm problem does not necessarily produce visible signs on autopsy but can be inferred from circumstances such as a victim suddenly clutching one's chest and collapsing.Nelson questioned Fowler extensively about carbon monoxide, which displaces oxygen in the bloodstream of people who breathe it in. Fowler said it could have contributed to oxygen depletion in Floyd, noting that he was facing the tailpipe end of a vehicle. But there is no way to know for sure because, he acknowledged, Floyd's blood was never tested for carbon monoxide.Nelson similarly tried to introduce another possible explanation on Tuesday when he raised questions about excited delirium, or what a witness described as a potentially lethal condition that can include agitation, incoherent speech and extraordinary strength.Several top Minneapolis police officials, including the police chief, have testified that Chauvin used excessive force and violated his training. And a number of medical experts called by prosecutors have said Floyd died from a lack of oxygen because the way he was restrained restricted his breathing.Fowler said the prone position alone does not affect a person’s ability to breathe -- testimony that contradicts other witnesses who said the position Floyd was in, with his hands cuffed behind his back, was inherently dangerous.He also testified that Chauvin's knee was not applied with enough pressure to cause any bruises or scrapes on Floyd's neck or back. He further said that Chauvin’s knee on Floyd was “nowhere close to his airway,” and that Floyd's speaking and groaning showed that his airway was still open.And he said Floyd that did not complain of visual changes or other symptoms consistent with hypoxia, or insufficient oxygen to the brain, and that he was coherent until shortly before he suddenly stopped moving.“The bottom line is, moving air in and out, and speaking and making noise is very good evidence that the airway was not closed,” Fowler said.Fowler handled a case similar to Floyd’s in Maryland in 2018, when a 19-year-old Black man, Anton Black, died after three officers and a civilian pinned him for more than five minutes as they handcuffed him and shackled his legs.The family brought a federal lawsuit that included Fowler, whose autopsy found that the stress of the struggle probably contributed to Black’s death but found no evidence that restraint directly caused it. It also found no evidence of asphyxia.Chauvin, a 45-year-old white man, is on trial on charges of murder and manslaughter in Floyd’s death after his arrest on suspicion of passing a counterfeit $20 at a neighborhood market. The video of his slow-motion death as he gasped that he couldn't breathe touched off worldwide protests, violence and a furious examination of racism and policing in the US.The defense hasn’t said whether Chauvin will take the stand.Testifying could open him up to devastating cross-examination, with prosecutors replaying the video and forcing Chauvin, one freeze-frame moment at a time, to explain why he kept pressing down on Floyd.But taking the stand could also give the jury the opportunity to see and hear any remorse or sympathy Chauvin might feel. He would be able to take off the Covid-19 mask that he has to wear while seated at the defense table.The only time Chauvin has been heard publicly defending himself was when the jury listened to body-camera footage from the scene. After an ambulance had taken Floyd away, Chauvin told a bystander: “We gotta control this guy ’cause he’s a sizable guy ... and it looks like he’s probably on something.”Earlier Wednesday, Judge Peter Cahill turned down a defense request to acquit Chauvin, rejecting claims that prosecutors failed to prove Chauvin’s actions killed Floyd. Requests for an acquittal are routinely made midway through a trial and are usually denied.The defense began its case on Tuesday with Nelson going straight to the question at the center of the trial — whether Chauvin's actions were reasonable.Police officers are allowed certain latitude to use force. Legal experts say a key issue for the jury will be whether the officer's actions were reasonable in those specific circumstances.A use-of-force expert for the defense, Barry Brodd, testified Tuesday that Chauvin was justified in keeping Floyd pinned to the pavement, saying Floyd kept on struggling.Brodd, a former Santa Rosa, California, police officer, also said the bystanders yelling at police to get off Floyd complicated the situation for Chauvin and the others by causing them to wonder whether the crowd was becoming a threat, too.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/expert-blames-george-floyd-s-death-on-heart-rhythm-problem-101618421806759.html

The Islamic Republic of Afghanistan respects the US decision and we will work with our US partners to ensure a smooth transition," Ghani tweeted."Afghanistan's proud security and defense forces are fully capable of defending its people and country, which they have been doing all along, and for which the Afghan nation will forever remain grateful."Biden officially announced Wednesday the unconditional withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan, where they have spent two decades in a bloody, largely fruitless battle against the Taliban. Administration officials have said he wants the withdrawal completed by September 11, 2021.US intelligence warned this week that the government in Kabul "will struggle" to hold the "confident" Taliban off if the coalition withdraws.Many Afghans -- especially women, who have been largely shut out of peace talks between the insurgents and Kabul -- have long feared a return to the Taliban's repressive Islamist regime if the US withdraws.Analysts also fear a descent into civil war if Kabul is left to face the Taliban alone. The United Nations documented "extraordinary" violence against civilians in a new report Wednesday, and said "urgent" action was needed by all parties to stop the fighting.Dubbed the "forever war," the US military onslaught in Afghanistan began in response to the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks against the United States.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghan-president-says-spoke-with-biden-about-us-forces-withdrawal-in-september-101618420602308.html

The charge carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison.The announcement came a day after Potter resigned from the Brooklyn Center Police Department, where she had served for 26 years. Police Chief Tim Gannon also resigned Tuesday.Gannon had released Potter’s body camera video the day after the Sunday shooting. It showed her approaching Wright as he stood outside of his car as another officer was arresting him for an outstanding warrant. Police said he was pulled over for having expired registration tags.As Wright struggles with police, Potter is hearing shouting “I’ll Tase you! I’ll Tase you! Taser! Taser! Taser!” before firing a single shot from her handgun.Gannon has said he believed Potter mistakenly grabbed her gun when she was going for her Taser. However, protesters and Wright’s family members say there’s no excuse for the shooting and it shows how the justice system is tilted against Blacks, noting Wright was stopped for expired car registration and ended up dead.The charging decision was announced as the trial of former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin progresses. George Floyd, a Black man, died May 25 after Chauvin, who is white, pressed his knee against Floyd’s neck.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/minnesota-cop-who-fatally-shot-black-motorist-to-be-charged-with-manslaughter-101618417846240.html
14-04-2021||World||Users could soon hide 'like' counts on Instagram, Facebook||The tiny red hearts that appear under Instagram photos of kids, kittens and sandwiches can be a source of stress for many users, an insidious way of measuring self worth and popularity.Now Facebook says it's going to test out — again — an option for users to hide those “like” counts to see if it can reduce the pressure of being on social media. Instagram, which Facebook owns, will soon allow a small group of random users to decide whether or not they want to see the number of likes their posts and those of others receive.The social media giant says it’s also exploring the feature for Facebook. Comments will still be available for people who chose to hide likes — they just won't see whether it was 2, 20 or 20,000 people who liked their posts.Instagram began hiding likes in 2019. While many users welcomed the feature, others, including some influencers, worried it might take away from the social media experience. At the time, the platform didn't give users a choice to hide or unhide the like counts.“Some people found this beneficial but some still wanted to see like counts so they could track what’s popular," the company said in a statement. In March of this year, a bug caused like counts to disappear for some Instagram uses for a couple of hours, prompting questions about whether the company would soon relaunch the feature.The company stressed that this is still a small test and that it expects “more to share" before long.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/users-could-soon-hide-like-counts-on-instagram-facebook-101618416486236.html
14-04-2021||World||Russia, Ukraine hold military drills, NATO criticises Russian troop build-up||Russia and Ukraine held simultaneous military drills on Wednesday as NATO foreign and defence ministers began emergency discussions on a massing of Russian troops near the Ukrainian border.Washington and NATO have been alarmed by the large build-up of Russian troops near Ukraine and in Crimea, the peninsula that Moscow annexed from Ukraine in 2014, and two U.S. warships are due to arrive in the Black Sea this week.Russia -- which said the U.S. naval move was an unfriendly provocation and warned Washington to stay far away from Crimea and its Black Sea coast -- says the build-up is a three-week snap military drill to test combat readiness in response to what it calls threatening behaviour from NATO. It has said the exercise is due to wrap up within two weeks.Ahead of the arrival of the U.S. warships, the Russian navy on Wednesday began a drill in the Black Sea that rehearsed firing at surface and air targets. The drill came a day after NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg called on Moscow to end its troop build-up.In Ukraine, armed forces rehearsed repelling a tank and infantry attack near the border of Russian-annexed Crimea while its defence minister, Andrii Taran, told European parliamentarians in Brussels that Russia was preparing to potentially store nuclear weapons in Crimea.Taran provided no evidence for his assertion but said Russia was massing 110,000 troops on Ukraine's border in 56 battalion-sized tactical groups, citing Kyiv's latest intelligence.Clashes in eastern UkraineFighting has increased in recent weeks in eastern Ukraine, where government forces have battled Russian-backed separatists in a seven-year conflict that Kyiv says has killed 14,000 people.U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who held talks in Brussels with Stoltenberg ahead of a video conference of all 30 NATO allies, said the alliance would "address Russia's aggressive actions in and around Ukraine", without elaborating.Russia's relations with the United States slumped to a new post-Cold War low last month after U.S. President Joe Biden said he thought Vladimir Putin was a "killer".In a phone call with Putin on Tuesday, Biden proposed holding a summit between the estranged leaders to tackle a raft of issues, including reducing tensions over Ukraine.The Kremlin on Wednesday said it was too early to talk about such a summit in tangible terms and that holding such a meeting was contingent on Washington's future behaviour, in what looked like a thinly veiled reference to potential U.S. sanctions.Russia has regularly accused NATO of destabilising Europe by bolstering its troops in the Baltic countries and Poland - all members of the Atlantic alliance - in the wake of Moscow's annexation of Crimea.NATO has denied a claim by Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu that the alliance was deploying 40,000 troops and 15,000 pieces of military equipment near Russia's borders, mainly in the Black Sea and the Baltic regions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-ukraine-hold-military-drills-nato-criticises-russian-troop-buildup-101618416471317.html
14-04-2021||World||British PM Boris Johnson reduces duration of India visit over Covid-19 crisis||British Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s visit to India this month will be shorter than the originally planned trip of four to five days and won’t include stopovers in Mumbai and Pune because of the Covid-19 situation, people familiar with developments said on Wednesday. Johnson is expected to begin the visit on April 26 and the itinerary will only include stopovers in cities such as New Delhi and Bengaluru that are linked to key meetings or important announcements and signing of memorandums of understanding (MoUs), the people said on condition of anonymity. Though both countries have confirmed Johnson’s visit in April, neither side has formally announced the dates or his itinerary. The visit has been described as part of the UK government’s tilt towards the Indo-Pacific under a comprehensive revamp of foreign and security policies in order to unlock new opportunities across the region. “The trip will be shorter and more business-oriented and involve fewer cities. The cities in the itinerary will be linked to key meetings and announcements and MoUs,” said one of the people cited above. The events will be a mix of in-person meetings, such as Johnson’s talks with his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi, and virtual meetings, the people said. Some events linked to the visit will be fully digital affairs, they added. An unnamed spokesperson for Johnson was cited by Reuters as saying on Wednesday that the prime minister had reduced the length of his trip to India because of the Covid-19 situation in the country. The spokesperson added Johnson would meet Modi. “We’ve been in close contact with the Indian government about the PM’s upcoming visit in light of the Covid situation in India. As a result of these discussions the prime minister has made the decision to reduce the length of the visit,” the spokesperson told reporters. “This programme will be focused on high level discussions with the Indian government and Indian business leaders,” the spokesperson said, adding the bulk of the programme will take place on April 26. It was earlier expected that Johnson’s visit would last four to five days and include stopovers in New Delhi, Mumbai, Pune, Bengaluru and Chennai. This is the second time a planned visit to India by Johnson has been hit by the Covid-19 crisis. In January, Johnson was scheduled to be the chief guest at the Republic Day celebrations but called off the visit to remain in Britain to focus on his government’s response to a new Coronavirus variant that had spread rapidly. The UK subsequently announced Johnson would travel to India at the end of April when it unveiled an integrated review of defence, development and foreign policy in March.

According to a South China Morning Post report, the convicted man, identified by his surname Huang, abducted and murdered a stranger to cremate him in place of another deceased to circumvent burial regulations.Burial is prohibited in many parts of China, including Shanwei city of Guangdong province where the incident took place. In 2017, a wealthy family hired Huang to provide them with a substitute body for cremation as they wanted a traditional burial for the deceased family member who died from cancer, as per court documents cited in media reports.The family assumed that Huang would look for another dead body but he killed someone to fulfil the deal. The convict spotted a man, Lin Shaoren, with Down’ syndrome, picking litter from the street and convinced him to get into a car. He then gave alcohol to the victim and put him into a coffin after he passed out, Huang told the court.Days later, Huang passed on the coffin to the family in exchange for 107,000 yuan ($16,300), of which 17,000 yuan went to a middleman who has since passed away. The family cremated the coffin pretending it to be their own dead relative and buried the relative’s actual body secretly in a traditional manner, per reports.The victim was listed as a missing person and it took two years for the police to uncover the crime and track down the suspect using surveillance footage. Huang was given a suspended death sentence in September 2020 and it was upheld by the Guangdong Higher People's Court in December 2020. The case gained public attention last week after local media did a feature on the victim’s family.Local authorities in China have been pushing for cremations to save land and discourage extravagant burial ceremonies. But traditional burial remains popular and the case reveals the lengths some families go to get around the ban. Citing data from the Ministry of Civil Affairs, SCMP reported that only about 52 per cent of those who died in 2019 were cremated that year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-man-killed-stranger-with-down-syndrome-to-sell-his-body-for-cremation-101618411802024.html

The White House released the excerpts before the afternoon address when he intends to detail his timeline for a U.S. troop withdrawal.His plan is to pull out all the American forces — numbering 2,500 now — by this Sept. 11, according to U.S. officials, marking the 20th anniversary of the deadliest terrorist attacks against America, which were coordinated from Afghanistan. The drawdown would begin by May 1, defying the deadline for full withdrawal under a peace agreement the Trump administration reached with the Taliban last year.“We cannot continue the cycle of extending or expanding our military presence in Afghanistan hoping to create the ideal conditions for our withdrawal, expecting a different result,” Biden says in the speech excerpts. “I am now the fourth American president to preside over an American troop presence in Afghanistan. Two Republicans. Two Democrats. I will not pass this responsibility to a fifth.”While Biden’s decision keeps U.S. forces in Afghanistan four months longer than initially planned, it sets a firm end to two decades of war that killed more than 2,200 U.S. troops, wounded 20,000, and cost as much as $1 trillion.Biden says he consulted with allies, military leaders, lawmakers and Vice President Kamala Harris to help make his decision to withdraw all U.S. troops by Sept. 11, two decades after the deadliest attack on American soil.He is emphasizing that his administration will continue to support peace talks between the Afghan government and the Taliban and assist international efforts to train the Afghan military.“It is time to end America’s longest war,” Biden says. “It is time for American troops to come home.”He also is trying to make the case that it is time to pay more attention to greater geopolitical challenges. In the early part of his presidency, Biden has spotlighted the growing economic competition with China and malign actions by Russia targeting the United States.“Rather than return to war with the Taliban, we have to focus on the challenges that will determine our standing and reach today and into the years to come,” Biden says, according to the excerpts.After his speech, Biden intends to visit Section 60 of Arlington National Cemetery to honor the sacrifice of those who died in recent American conflicts.A senior administration official said the September withdrawal date was an absolute deadline that won't be affected by security conditions in Afghanistan.The conflict largely crippled al-Qaida and led to the death of Osama bin Laden, the architect of the Sept. 11 attacks. But an American withdrawal also risks many of the gains made in democracy, women's rights and governance, while ensuring that the Taliban, who provided al-Qaida's haven, remain strong and in control of large swaths of the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/time-to-end-america-s-longest-war-biden-on-afghanistan-101618414324213.html
14-04-2021||World||EU to get 50 million Pfizer doses early as Denmark scraps AstraZeneca||The EU said Wednesday it would get 50 million Pfizer vaccine doses earlier than expected, as rival drugmaker AstraZeneca faced a fresh setback after Denmark banned its use over blood clot links.The news comes after Johnson & Johnson said it would delay its European rollout, a major hit for the continent's beleaguered immunisation campaign as several countries battle rising caseloads.The vaccine setbacks threaten to dampen hopes that immunisations will allow countries to emerge from the pandemic that has now killed close to three million people and ravaged the global economy.But it was not all bad news in Europe, which will soon receive 50 million doses of the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine initially expected at the end of this year.The doses will now be delivered in the second quarter of this year, and will start arriving as soon as this month.EU Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen said "there are still many factors that can disrupt the planned delivery schedules of vaccines", referring to the J&J delay."It is therefore important to act swiftly, anticipate and adjust whenever it is possible."More than 820 million doses of vaccine have now been administered globally, but with demand far outstripping supply, countries are scrambling to secure much-needed jabs.The race to secure vaccines has sparked diplomatic rows, notably between the European Union and the UK after the bloc accused London of hoarding jabs.But Australia has also accused the EU of falling short on promised jabs. Canberra's trade minister will travel to Europe this week for talks with his counterparts in Germany, France and Brussels about vaccine exports.- 'Third wave is upon us' - Johnson & Johnson said it would put off its European deliveries over reports of rare blood clots among people who had received the shot.US health regulators also recommended pausing its use after six reported cases of clots -- among more than 6.8 million J&J doses administered in the US.The European Medicines Agency (EMA) said Wednesday it would make a recommendation on the safety of the J&J jab next week after evaluating clot links.AstraZeneca has faced similar setbacks, with many countries now limiting its use to older people following isolated cases blood clots among younger populations, some fatal.Denmark said Wednesday it would stop using it altogether -- a European first -- despite assurances from the EMA and the World Health Organization that side effects far outweigh possible risks.The melee over vaccines comes as several countries, from Germany to India to Turkey, battle a worrying spike in cases.In some places, it is no longer just the elderly who are crowding into overrun hospitals.German doctors said they are treating an increasing number of young people as new variants sweep the country."The third wave is clearly upon us," said Thomas Marx, the medical director at the Bavarian hospital in Freising.Most Covid patients are now between 40 and 60, and are badly hit by the virus, he told AFP."They often have to be intubated and then face a long fight with the virus."- River Ganges infections - In India more than 1,000 people tested positive for the virus after bathing in the River Ganges for the world's biggest religious festival.A huge crowd of worshippers packed the river's banks to take a dip in the waters as part of a bathing ritual -- despite soaring virus cases in the country."Our faith is the biggest thing for us. It is because of that strong belief that so many people have come here to take a dip in Ganga," Siddharth Chakrapani, a member of one of the Kumbh Mela organising committees, told AFP."They believe that Maa (mother) Ganga will save them from this pandemic."In Turkey officials imposed new restrictions including a tougher overnight curfew, while in Bangladesh police patrolled the capital as a strict nationwide lockdown was rolled out.Europe passed a million Covid deaths this week, with many countries from France to Italy and Spain still facing some form of virus restrictions after the continent's sputtering vaccine rollout.But in Belgium, cafes and restaurants got the greenlight to open their terraces from May 8 after a slight easing of cases there. Swiss officials also announced that bars and restaurants and some leisure facilities could reopen next Monday.In Japan, a spike in Covid cases forced a section of the Tokyo Olympics torch relay to be pulled from public roads, fuelling fears about whether the postponed Games should go ahead with just 100 days to go before the scheduled opening.International Olympic Committee vice president John Coates said Wednesday cancellation is "certainly not" on the table."The Tokyo Games will be the light at the end of the tunnel," he told reporters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-to-get-50-million-pfizer-doses-early-as-denmark-scraps-astrazeneca-101618412505344.html
14-04-2021||World||Russian President Vladimir Putin gets 2nd dose of Covid-19 vaccine||Russian President Vladimir Putin said Wednesday he got his second Covid-19 vaccine shot, three weeks after getting the first dose.The Russian leader announced getting the jab, which was kept out of the public eye, at a session of the Russian Geographical Society, in which he took part via video link.“Right now, before entering this hall, I have also gotten the second jab. I hope everything will be fine. I don't even hope as much as I'm sure of it,” Putin said.The president told reporters after the event that he didn't experience any adverse effects after the second shot. “As you see, everything is normal, no side effects,” Putin said, adding that doctors told him he developed "a good immune response" after the first shot.Putin got his first coronavirus shot on March 23, also out of sight of the cameras, and the Kremlin wouldn't reveal which of the three vaccines currently approved for use in Russia the president has taken.The Russian leader's vaccination comes several months after widespread immunization against Covid-19 started in Russia — a delay that puzzled many, with some critics arguing that it was contributing to the already existing public hesitancy about the vaccine.Russian authorities have given regulatory approval to three domestically developed shots — Sputnik V, EpiVacCorona and CoviVac. All three received authorization before completing advanced trials experts say are necessary to ensure their safety and effectiveness in line with established scientific protocol.However, a study published in February in the British medical journal the Lancet showed that Sputnik V is 91% effective and appears to prevent inoculated individuals from becoming severely ill with Covid-19, although it's still unclear whether the vaccine can prevent the spread of the disease. No data on efficacy of the two other vaccines have been released.Russia has been actively marketing Sputnik V abroad, despite the comparatively slow rollout at home and limited production capacities. Dozens of countries have approved the use of Sputnik V, and many signed deals with the Russian Direct Investment Fund that bankrolled the vaccine to get shipments of the shot.A February poll by Russia's top independent pollster, Levada Center, showed that 62% of Russians were reluctant to get vaccinated with Sputnik V.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russian-president-vladimir-putin-gets-2nd-dose-of-covid-19-vaccine-101618411556582.html

14-04-2021||World||Facebook, Starbucks, other US companies unite for voting rights||Hundreds of U.S. corporations and executives signed on to a new statement calling for a defense of Americans’ voting rights, the latest united backlash against state initiatives that could restrict voters’ access to the polls.In a full page advertisement that ran Wednesday in the New York Times, the signatories called for “all Americans to join us in taking a nonpartisan stand for this most basic and fundamental right.”“We all should feel a responsibility to defend the right to vote and to oppose any discriminatory legislation or measures that restrict or prevent any eligible voter from having an equal and fair opportunity to cast a ballot,” the statement read.The letter stopped short of specific actions, such as halting donations to candidates that support restrictions on voter access or pausing investments in states that act upon such proposals.Signatories span big tech companies like Facebook Inc., consumer companies including Starbucks Corp. and Target Corp., and financial firms, among others. Michael Bloomberg, founder and majority owner of Bloomberg News parent company Bloomberg LP, also signed as an individual.The push by Corporate America comes as a number of state legislatures move to limit voting access, with some curbs already passed. A new law in Georgia last month requires voters to provide a state-issued identification card when requesting an absentee ballot and limits drop boxes, among other restrictions, with Texas, Arizona and Florida discussing their own restrictions.“The freedom to vote is a huge priority for the public, consumers and employees,” Mike Ward, co-founder of the Civic Alliance, which assisted in the initiative, said in an interview. “Businesses are leading because they have their fingers on pulse of their key stakeholders and they know that the freedom to vote and health of democracy is a top priority.”The statement shows the movement is gaining traction. It was Black CEOs who originally condemned restrictions and began to push for action, including Kenneth Chenault, the former chief at American Express Co., and Kenneth Frazier, the CEO of Merck & Co. Wednesday’s statement also includes nonprofits, foundations, law firms and celebrities, from Leo DiCaprio to Larry David.Critics of the new voting restrictions say the changes are aimed chiefly at limiting participation of Americans of color. And while in the past, many companies tried to stay out of political disputes for fear of drawing a partisan backlash, customers are increasingly demanding their favorite brands take a stance on issues that matter to them, from sustainability to inclusion.“There is a budding realization from business leaders: Society expects more from them. They cannot do and will not do business as usual,” Meredith Sumpter, CEO of the Council for Inclusive Capitalism, said in an interview. “They are exploring a new frontier of leadership as CEOs in a very divided America."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facebook-starbucks-other-us-companies-unite-for-voting-rights-101618403933233.html
14-04-2021||World||Denmark becomes first in EU to drop AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine||Denmark has become the first country in the European Union to drop AstraZeneca Plc’s vaccine from its Covid-19 inoculation program, amid concerns over its serious side effects.The country has decided to “continue the roll-out of its vaccination program, without AstraZeneca,” the Danish Health Authority said in a statement on Wednesday.“There is a link between rare, but serious” side effects and the Covid-19 vaccine produced by AstraZeneca, the authority said. It listed the risk of blood clots, hemorrhaging and a low number of blood platelets.Given that the pandemic has been kept reasonably well in check in Denmark, the authority said it was deemed acceptable to take Astra out of the country’s vaccine program, which it estimates will delay overall immunization by about three weeks.Denmark was one of the first countries to suspend the vaccine on March 11 after reports of blood clots. At the time, the Danish Health Authority called the decision a precautionary move and reiterated its view that Astra’s vaccine was “effective and safe.”Both European and British drug regulators have said they found a link between Astra’s vaccine and blood clots, but said benefits still outweigh the risks. Most Western European countries have limited their use of the company’s vaccine to the elderly, while in Eastern Europe, Astra has largely been reinstated with no limitations.Denmark’s Scandinavian neighbor, Norway, which has also kept Astra on hold since last month, is due to announce its decision on Thursday.Danish authorities said that people who have already received a first Astra shot will be offered their second jab from another producer, such as Pfizer Inc./BioNTech SE or Moderna Inc.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/denmark-becomes-first-in-eu-to-drop-astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine-101618403545249.html
14-04-2021||World||AstraZeneca, J&J blood clot scare: What do we know about treatment, causal link with Covid-19 shots||The United States has paused the use of Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) after six recipients experienced a rare and severe type of blood clot. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on Tuesday said that the vaccinated individuals experienced cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) along with low levels of blood platelets.This comes a week after the United Kingdom suspended the use of AstraZeneca’s Covid-19 vaccine for adults under 30s over similar concerns. A scientific review by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) concluded that the evidence of a link between the events of blood clots and AstraZeneca’s vaccine was stronger but more work is still needed.“No effective medicine or vaccine is without risk. We continually monitor safety during widespread use of any vaccine. This is to ensure vaccines are performing as expected, to identify any new side effects that may arise, and to ensure the benefits continue to outweigh the risks,” Dr June Raine, MHRA chief executive, said at a briefing.One common link between the vaccines developed by AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson is that both are built with adenoviruses, a replication-deficient chimpanzee viral vector based on a weakened version of a common cold virus. Two teams of researchers have speculated about a possible mechanism behind the casual link in their papers published in the New England Journal of Medicine.Both teams suggest that the development of serious blood clots along with falling levels of blood platelets is an immune response that resembles a rare reaction, called heparin induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), to the drug heparin, an anticoagulant. The first research paper described 11 blood clot cases in Austria and Germany, of which nine of them women, with a median age of 36 years.All 11 patients tested positive for antibodies against platelet factor 4 (PF4), which are also triggered by heparin induced thrombocytopenia. However, none of the patients had received heparin before their symptoms. “Whether these antibodies are autoantibodies against PF4 induced by the strong inflammatory stimulus of vaccination or antibodies induced by the vaccine that cross-react with PF4 and platelets requires further study,” the researchers wrote.Also Read | AstraZeneca Covid shot: Are blood clot events more common in women recipients?In the second study, researchers in Norway described a similar pattern in five healthcare workers after receiving the first dose of AstraZeneca’s Covid-19 vaccine. Four of the patients had a major cerebral haemorrhage and three died. All of them had high levels of PF4 antibodies with no previous exposure to heparin.Both sets of researchers have suggested treatment with intravenous immune globulin and non-heparin blood thinners. The National Health Service (NHS) of the UK has also authorised the use of intravenous immunoglobulin, which is in short supply according to UK media reports, to treat such cases.However, Peter English, former editor of Vaccines in Practice, said that these papers do not tackle causality since the small sample size do not have the statistical power to prove causality.“They may turn out to be useful...for clinicians treating patients with clotting disorders, and for regulators and others in deciding the safest way to proceed once causality has been confirmed—if it ever is,” The BMJ, a weekly peer-reviewed medical trade journal, quoted English as saying.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/astrazeneca-j-j-blood-clot-scare-what-do-we-know-about-causal-link-treatment-101618402177279.html

14-04-2021||World||US Prez Joe Biden rushes to protect the power grid as hacking threats grow||A White House plan to rapidly shore up the security of the US power grid will begin with a 100-day sprint, but take years more to transform utilities’ ability to fight off hackers, according to details of a draft version of the plan confirmed by two people.The plan is the policy equivalent of a high-wire act: it provides incentives for electric companies to dramatically change the way they protect themselves against cyber-attacks while trying to avoid political tripwires that have stalled previous efforts, the details suggest.Among its core tenets, the Biden administration’s so-called “action plan” will incentivize power utilities to install sophisticated new monitoring equipment to more quickly detect hackers, and to share that information widely with the US government.It will ask utilities to identify critical sites which, if attacked, could have an outsized impact across the grid, according to a six-page draft of the plan, which was drawn up by the National Security Council and described in detail to Bloomberg News. And it will expand a partially classified Energy Department program to identify flaws in grid components that could be exploited by the country’s cyber-adversaries, including Russia, Iran and China.The plan marks the first step in a broad push to protect utilities from cyber-attacks that could leave millions without power, water or gas. A final version of the plan could be released as soon as this week, according to a person familiar with the timing.“It makes sense in a plan like this to start with grid operations,” said Christopher Painter, who was the highest ranking cyber official in the State Department during the Obama administration.“Everything goes down if you don’t have power: the financial sector, refineries, water. The grid underlies the rest of the country’s critical infrastructure,” Painter, now with the Global Commission on the Stability of Cyberspace, added.Experts say initiatives to enhance the security of the US electrical grid are years behind better-known efforts to improve the security of data centers and corporate computer systems. At the same time, hackers from Russia, China, Iran and North Korea are launching increasingly aggressive attacks on US power companies, hoping to pre-position malware that could leave US cities and towns in the dark.The recent weather-related outages in Texas, while not the result of a cyber-attack, were a stark demonstration of the potential for devastation. People froze in their homes, struggled to access drinkable water and lost communications because their mobile phones couldn’t charge as grid operators struggled for days to restore power.Read more: Biden to Tap Former NSA Officials to Top Cybersecurity RolesThe White House plan lays out the need for a broad effort to secure the highly specialized computers used not just by electric companies, but also municipal water utilities, gas pipeline operators and others.Two people familiar with the administration’s thinking said power companies were chosen to begin with because they already have a strong record of working with the US government on security threats. While private companies are usually loath to share computer network data widely with the government, some power companies already do so as part of existing pilot programs, one of the people said.Participation IncentivesThe White House plan, which is voluntary, lays out a series of possible incentives to get power companies to sign on, a less politically precarious route than mandating their participation through regulation.Smaller utilities such as rural co-ops may get government funding to cover the cost of new security equipment and software, for example. The government will explore whether participation could be covered under the Safety Act, which provides liability protection for anti-terrorism products and services, according to the plan -- although it’s far from clear that services provided by an electric utility would qualify.Many of the details around budgets and incentives will be worked out later, through a process coordinated by the National Security Council and others, according to the draft.Utilities’ decisions to participate will hinge on how those details eventually get resolved, cybersecurity experts said. For example, the plan addresses long-standing concerns over sharing details about cyber-attacks automatically with the government by prohibiting “sensitive data” from being collected or stored outside the utilities.But the plan doesn’t yet define what counts as sensitive data, and it makes clear that any data collected must be widely sharable across the federal government.The plan will also expand the role of an Energy Department program that scans grid equipment for flaws or hidden components that hackers could use to attack utilities. Aspects of that program, known as CyTRICS, are classified because they involve efforts by foreign intelligence agencies to intentionally weaken grid technology, according to a person familiar with it. (CyTRICS stands for Cyber Testing for Resilient Industrial Control Systems.)While utilities have supported similar efforts in the past, the creation of an approved vendor list could increase costs for equipment manufacturers that would be required to make their products more secure -- a proposal likley to draw resistence from US and foreign manufacturers, one person familiar with the industry said.Turf WarsIn order to succeed, the plan will have to overcome challenges that have derailed earlier efforts, including interagency turf wars and questions over how much of a role U.S. intelligence agencies should have in protecting the country’s critical infrastructure.The power sector effort will be led by the Energy Department rather than the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, or CISA, part of the Department of Homeland Security, according to the summary.That could raise concerns about CISA losing its existing authorities and possibly ceding the program entirely to the Energy Department, according to current and former DHS officials, as well as an aide on the House Homeland Security Committee. That panel approved a bipartisan bill in March to solidify CISA’s lead role in protecting the country’s industrial control systems (H.R. 1833).“The risk you take in not having CISA do everything is that information doesn’t get where it needs to be,” according to Suzanne Spaulding, who led CISA’s predecessor, the National Protection and Programs Directorate, under the Obama administration and now works at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.As the White House plan was quietly circulated to officials recently, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas reiterated what he believed was CISA’s primary role in a policy speech in late March.After lauding the administration’s cybersecurity plans, he added, “As some have said, the government needs a quarterback on its cybersecurity team. CISA is that quarterback.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-prez-joe-biden-rushes-to-protect-the-power-grid-as-hacking-threats-grow-101618396014349.html

Beijing was cracking down on tech businesses, and India blacklisted some of its social-media apps.For all the obstacles, ByteDance kept growing. Now its founder, 38-year-old Zhang Yiming, is among the world’s richest people -- a distinction that lately has carried increased risks in China.Shares of the company trade in the private market at a valuation of more than $250 billion, people familiar with the dealings have said. At that level, Zhang, who owns about a quarter of ByteDance, could be worth more than $60 billion, placing him alongside Tencent Holdings Ltd.’s Pony Ma, bottled-water king Zhong Shanshan and members of the Walton and Koch families in the US, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.ByteDance, famous for its short-video apps and news aggregator Toutiao, more than doubled revenue last year after expanding beyond its core advertising business into areas such as e-commerce and online gaming. It’s now weighing options for the initial public offering of some businesses.“Zhang is someone who’s known for thinking long-term and not easily dissuaded by short-term setbacks,” said Ma Rui, partner at venture-capital firm Synaptic Ventures. “He is set on building an enduring, global business.”Surging ValuationDuring its last fundraising round, ByteDance reached a $180 billion valuation, a person with knowledge of the matter said. That’s up from $20 billion about three years ago, according to CB Insights. But in the private market, some investors recently were asking for the equivalent of a $350 billion valuation to part with their shares, people familiar have said. The company’s value for private-equity investors is approaching $400 billion, the South China Morning Post reported. That would mean an even bigger fortune for Zhang.ByteDance representatives didn’t respond to requests for comment.It’s a tough time to be wealthy in China as the government seeks to rein in the country’s most powerful corporations and their billionaire founders. Just ask Jack Ma: After opening an antitrust probe, regulators fined Alibaba a record $2.8 billion and the central bank ordered an overhaul of his Ant Group Co. fintech empire so it’d be supervised more like a bank. On Tuesday, China ordered 34 internet companies to rectify their anti-competitive practices in the coming month.While ByteDance hasn’t been singled out as a target, its dominance in social media and war chest for deal-making are sensitive areas the government is looking into.“There are no more silly games in the US with Trump and potential bans or forced asset sales,” said Kirk Boodry, founder of investment research firm Redex Holdings. “But the pressure on tech-share prices and China in particular might make $250 billion a tough sell,” he added, referring to ByteDance’s value in private transactions.Born in the southern Chinese city of Longyan, Zhang, the only son of civil servants, studied programming at Tianjin’s Nankai University, where he built a following on the school’s online forum by fixing classmates’ computers. He joined Microsoft Corp. for a brief stint after graduating, later calling the job so boring he often “worked half of the day and read books in the other half,” according to an interview with Chinese media. He went on to develop several ventures, including a real estate search portal.His breakthrough came in 2012, when working in a four-bedroom apartment in Beijing he created ByteDance’s first hit -- a joke-sharing app later shut down by censors. It then turned to news aggregation before winning over more than 1 billion global users with its short-video platforms TikTok and Chinese twin app, Douyin. In the process, it attracted big-name investors such as SoftBank Group Corp., Sequoia Capital and proprietary-trading firm Susquehanna International Group, making it a rarity among Chinese internet startups that usually get absorbed into the wider ecosystems of Tencent and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.Novel ConceptOne of Zhang’s earliest supporters, Susquehanna has become ByteDance’s largest outside backer with a 15% stake, according to a Wall Street Journal story in October. The initial bet was made at the start of 2012, when ByteDance’s news app Toutiao was just a concept that Zhang had drawn up on napkins, according to a 2016 blog post by Joan Wang, who led that investment for Susquehanna’s Chinese venture-capital unit.With TikTok facing scrutiny in the US and India, Zhang has put more effort into ByteDance’s nascent and fast-growing Chinese businesses, which range from gaming to education to e-commerce. That helped it increase sales to about $35 billion last year and operating profit to $7 billion, a person familiar with the results said.Investors are eyeing the IPO of some of ByteDance’s businesses after Chinese competitor Kuaishou Technology raised $5.4 billion in February in the biggest internet listing since Uber Technologies Inc., with its market value now nearing $140 billion. Last month, ByteDance hired former Xiaomi Corp. executive Chew Shou Zi as its chief financial officer, filling a long vacant position that will be crucial for its eventual market offering.But for Zhang, it’s not all about immediate payoffs. The affable founder is known for his business philosophy of “delaying satisfactions” as he puts the focus on long-term growth -- a message he stressed again during his spiel to employees at the company’s ninth anniversary celebration last month.“Keep an ordinary mind, that’s something that sounds easy but important to do,” he said. “Put in the plainest words, when hungry, eat, when tired, sleep.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tiktok-founder-s-60-billion-fortune-lands-him-among-world-s-richest-people-101618387083605.html
14-04-2021||World||Kremlin says will 'study' US proposal for Putin-Biden summit||The Kremlin said Wednesday it will consider US President Joe Biden's proposal to hold a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin.In a phone call on Tuesday, Biden proposed that the two leaders hold a summit "in the near future" that would come at a time of heightened tensions between the former Cold War rivals."It is early to talk about this meeting in terms of specifics. This is a new proposal and it will be studied," Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters.He added that there is still no set agenda for the summit, but said that "without a doubt bilateral ties are important" in areas of mutual interest.Tensions between Moscow and Washington have escalated in recent weeks, with Russia building up its troops on the border with Ukraine, where government forces have been fighting pro-Russian separatists since the annexation of Crimea in 2014.The United States and its allies have called on Moscow to withdraw its forces."We consider the concerns of anyone -- including the United States -- regarding the movement of our armed forces on Russian territory to be unfounded," Peskov said.The Kremlin has repeatedly denied its involvement in the long-simmering conflict and rejected claims that it props up the separatist forces.Ties were already strained after Washington demanded the release of jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny and slapped sanctions on Moscow over his poisoning in August last year.Peskov, however, said that Navalny was not discussed in the Putin-Biden call.A Kremlin statement on Tuesday said that the two leaders discussed Ukraine as well as the Iranian nuclear programme, Afghanistan peace talks and climate change.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kremlin-says-will-study-us-proposal-for-putin-biden-summit-101618393233674.html
14-04-2021||World||Egypt seizes Suez ship ‘Ever Given’ pending $900 million compensation||Egypt seized a giant container vessel that blocked the Suez Canal last month as talks continued over the more than $900 million in compensation sought by authorities.A court in the city of Ismailia granted a seizure request regarding the Ever Given vessel at the behest of the Suez Canal Authority, state-run Ahram Gate reported Tuesday on its website.Egypt’s move underscores the legal complications following the container vessel’s grounding on March 23, which closed the canal for almost a week and roiled shipping markets. Logjams are expected to continue in the coming weeks at major ports such as Singapore and Rotterdam because of disruptions to schedules, according to supply-chain data provider project44.The Suez Canal Authority’s chief executive officer, Osama Rabie, told an Egyptian TV channel late Tuesday that negotiations with the ship’s owners and insurers were taking longer than anticipated, especially given the vessel and its containers were undamaged.The ship’s insurer for third-party losses, the U.K. P&I Club, said in a statement on Tuesday that the Ever Given’s owner -- Japan-based Shoei Kisen Kaisha Ltd. -- received a claim for $916 million.“Despite the magnitude of the claim which was largely unsupported, the owners and their insurers have been negotiating in good faith with the SCA,” the statement said. “On 12 April, a carefully considered and generous offer was made to the SCA to settle their claim. We are disappointed by the SCA’s subsequent decision to arrest the vessel today.”The U.K. P&I Club also said it was “disappointed at comments by the SCA that the ship will be held in Egypt until compensation is paid, and that her crew will be unable to leave the vessel during this time.”Loss of FeesThe SCA has said compensation is needed to cover losses of transit fees, damage to the waterway during the dredging and salvage efforts, and the cost of equipment and labor. It has calculated that it missed out on about $15 million of transit fees each day.The U.K. P&I Club said the claim included a $300 million salvage bonus and another $300 million for loss of reputation.“The claim presented by the SCA also does not include the professional salvor’s claim for their salvage services which owners and their hull underwriters expect to receive separately,” the U.K. P&I Club said. “The grounding resulted in no pollution and no reported injuries. The vessel was re-floated after six days and the Suez Canal promptly resumed their commercial operations.”Negotiations will continue, it said. The SCA didn’t respond to requests for comment.The SCA’S CEO, speaking to Egypt’s Mehwar TV channel, said the owners and insurers “didn’t say when or what they’ll pay” and hadn’t mentioned specific figures.“We sent them a figure, they said we want a breakdown,” Rabie said. “We sent the breakdown, they said we want a detailed one. We sent them a detailed breakdown, but so far nothing.”Rabie stressed again that seizing the Ever Given is a legal procedure that would be lifted as soon as there’s payment.A spokesman for Shoei Kisen Kaisha declined to comment on compensation while discussions with the SCA are underway. The company said the crew is still on board the ship, which is now in the Great Bitter Lake, about halfway along the canal.The charterer, Taiwan’s Evergreen Marine Corp., said in an email it hadn’t received any information from the ship’s owner about a court order.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/egypt-seizes-suez-ship-ever-given-pending-900-million-compensation-101618393228237.html

He added that Kerry is visiting at the invitation of Ministry of Ecology and Environment. The environmental ministry said in a statement that the two will discuss China-US climate cooperation, this year’s UN Climate Change Conference and other issues.The meetings come after a rocky encounter between top US and Chinese foreign policy officials in Alaska last month that had the two sides trading insults and lectures. It may be a sign that despite significant differences between the world’s two biggest emitters on trade and foreign policy issues, they will be able to find common ground in the battle against climate change.The US is seeking to regain its position as a global climate leader after former president Donald Trump implemented pro-fossil fuel policies and turned away from efforts to limit US greenhouse-gas production. Kerry, an ex-secretary of state, has been criss-crossing the globe to encourage other nations to step up their efforts, and the US is considering a pledge to cut its greenhouse-gas emissions by 50% or more by the end of the decade.Biden has invited 40 world leaders to the climate summit, representing 17 of the biggest economies as well as smaller nations that will be among the first to feel the catastrophic impact of climate change.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-envoy-john-kerry-s-visit-to-china-on-climate-will-be-first-by-biden-team-101618392728803.html

But a source revealed that the 'Suits' alum wanted to "support" Harry at the funeral following the couple's bombshell interview with Oprah Winfrey.A source close to the Duchess of Sussex told E! News that Meghan would have attended Prince Philip's funeral were she not too far along in her pregnancy.The source said, "Meghan wishes she could have flown to the U.K. to support her husband but has been advised not to due to her pregnancy.""She would have put all the family tension aside to be there with Harry," the insider continued, before adding that the couple "are still not on amazing terms with the family."But Harry's trip to the UK comes at an opportune time, according to the source, as it's allowed him and Prince William to continue "working on their relationship" after an apparent fallout.The insider further said, "Harry wants to make sure Meghan and the baby are healthy and not involved in stressful situations," such as the very public funeral of Queen Elizabeth II's husband.Though Meghan and Harry want to make amends with the royal family, the insider said, "They have been focused on their new roots in Montecito and the pregnancy," which comes after the Duchess of Sussex suffered a miscarriage last July.This week saw Harry's return to his home country and their marital home at Frogmore Cottage, where the Prince is quarantining ahead of the Duke's funeral.Due to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, only 30 people are allowed to attend Prince Philip's funeral services at St. George's Chapel on the grounds of Windsor Castle this Saturday. A Buckingham Palace spokesperson said Philip's family members, including his children and grandchildren, are expected to be in attendance.Though many people will miss the Duke of Edinburgh, none are as mournful as the Queen, according to Prince Andrew. Last weekend, the royal told reporters that his mother is "feeling it probably more than everybody else."Prince Andrew shared, "She's contemplating, is the way I would put it. She described it as having left a huge void in her life, but we, the family, the ones that are closer, are rallying around to make sure we are there to support her."Buckingham Palace had announced on Friday that Philip, the husband of Queen Elizabeth II, died "peacefully" at Windsor Castle at the age of 99.Philip became the queen's consort, or official companion, after her father, King George VI, suddenly passed in 1952. He was the longest-serving British consort over his 73-year marriage to the queen.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/meghan-markle-wanted-to-support-harry-at-prince-philip-s-funeral-report-101618391434069.html
14-04-2021||World||UK expands Covid-19 mix and match vaccine trial||A study assessing the benefits of mixing and matching coronavirus vaccines has been extended to include the Moderna and Novavax jabs.The Com-Cov study, led by the University of Oxford, has been investigating the immune responses of volunteers given a dose of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine followed by the Pfizer jab, and vice versa, since February.Now, an expanded study will seek to recruit adults aged over 50 who have received their first dose in the past eight to 12 weeks to test out the immune response when combined with one of the other vaccines as a second dose."The focus of both this and the original Com-Cov study is to explore whether the multiple Covid-19 vaccines that are available can be used more flexibly, with different vaccines being used for the first and second dose,” said Matthew Snape, associate professor in paediatrics and vaccinology at the University of Oxford and chief investigator on the trial.“If we can show that these mixed schedules generate an immune response that is as good as the standard schedules, and without a significant increase in the vaccine reactions, this will potentially allow more people to complete their COVID-19 immunisation course more rapidly. This would also create resilience within the system in the event of a shortfall in availability of any of the vaccines in use," he said.Six new arms of the trial will each recruit 175 candidates, adding a further 1,050 volunteers into the programme and the research will take place across eight sites in the UK.Researchers will be looking for adverse reactions and the immune system responses to these new combinations of vaccines. The trial is not designed to show if the vaccines are effective at preventing disease and the University of Oxford has said the intent of the study is to show that mixing is not substantially worse than not mixing.The Com-Cov study remit reads: “The purpose of this trial is to see how well people’s immune systems respond when their second ‘boost’ dose is a different type of vaccine to their first “prime” dose.“We will also be looking at how common vaccine reactions, such as fever, are after such ‘mixed’ schedules. This is important, as being able to use different vaccines in this way creates a more flexible immunisation programme; potentially allowing more people to be immunised more quickly.”The researchers said they are enrolling people from all ethnicities and would particularly welcome participants from ethnic minority communities, considered among the higher-risk groups affected by Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-expands-covid-19-mix-and-match-vaccine-trial-101618391174945.html

He stopped on his route to do a drug deal, before veering into the emergency lane of the freeway in Kew and ploughing his 19-tonne prime mover into officers and their stationary vehicles on April 22 last year, The Age newspaper reported.Constable Lynette Taylor, senior constable Kevin King and constables Glen Humphris and Josh Prestney died at the scene, The Guardian reported.Singh was jailed for 22 years, with a non-parole period of 18 year and six months, the report said.Justice Paul Coghlan said the crash had “shocked the public conscience” and described footage of the incident as chilling.“The grief of those close to the victims is profound and life-changing,” Coghlan told the court.“Such grief is heightened by the sudden and unnecessary nature of the deaths. We can only hope ... as time goes by, some amelioration of their suffering can come about.”He was "actively psychotic" as he claimed he had seen a witch before killing the officers in the crash.The officers had pulled over Porsche driver Richard Pusey for allegedly speeding at the time. Multiple CCTV cameras showed footage of Singh "repeatedly drifting" into the emergency lane of the freeway before the crash, 9news.com reported.Singh's reckless driving was observed by other motorists, with one witness saying: "He's going to...kill someone."Singh was an ice user who, investigators estimate, had rested only five of the 72 hours before the crash and spent much of those three days dealing and using drugs with associates when not driving, The Age reported.The heartbroken families of the four fallen police officers say "no amount of punishment" can ease the grief they feel over losing their loved ones, it said.Assistant Commissioner Glenn Weir said police would commemorate the anniversary in services next week and one later this year that would be open to the public given the “overwhelming” support shown to the force from the community.The tragedy, he said, was a reminder of the daily risks police faced performing their duties. “That’s not lost on us,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indianorigin-truck-driver-jailed-for-22-years-for-killing-4-australian-police-101618390964042.html
14-04-2021||World||Biden says pause on Johnson & Johnson shots shows govt putting safety 1st||President Joe Biden's Covid-19 vaccination campaign hit a snag when federal regulators recommended a “pause” in administering Johnson & Johnson shots.But the White House portrayed the action as important validation of his measured approach throughout the rollout.Biden declared Tuesday that even with a temporary loss of J&J's one-shot vaccine, there is a huge supply of Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, enough that "is basically 100 per cent unquestionable, for every single, solitary American.”Perhaps more concerning than any worry about supply, however, is the potential blow to public confidence in all of the vaccines, as polls suggest potentially tens of millions of Americans are hesitant to get the shots that public health experts say are necessary for the nation to emerge from the pandemic.The pause actually should have the opposite effect, boosting confidence that the government is putting safety first, Biden and top health officials said at a White House briefing.The advisory by the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — citing a need to investigate reports of rare but potentially dangerous blood clots — was “testimony to how seriously we take safety," said Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert.In the opening months of his presidency, Biden has put top priority on a robust response to the virus that has killed 559,000 Americans, with a vaccine campaign in which nearly 50 per cent of adults have received at least one shot.His actions have received generally strong reviews, and hesitancy toward taking the vaccine has gradually declined as inoculations have increased. With three vaccines in use in the U.S. and plenty of supply in the pipeline, Biden actually has received some criticism for not sharing more vaccines with other nations. The president said Tuesday's action proved the wisdom of his approach.“My message to the American people on the vaccine is, I told you all," Biden told reporters after the announcement, adding that he “made sure we have 600 million doses” just from Pfizer and Moderna in the pipeline.The Johnson & Johnson pause, which regulators say they hope to resolve within days, comes on the heels of production issues at the Baltimore plant that produces the J& J vaccine.The White House, which got only about 12 hours' notice that some sort of announcement was coming and did not have any advance warning about the substance of the FDA and CDC's action, moved swiftly to minimise concerns about its impact.Aides recognised that they had to portray the decision as ensuring the “gold standard” of safety, to avoid feeding into vaccine hesitancy.“I think it's a very strong argument for safety actually,” Fauci said.White House coronavirus coordinator Jeff Zients added that the pause by the agencies “should reassure the American public that they will be very diligent and conservative about how they approach the vaccines.”They argued the pause proved the prudence of Biden's cautious approach to promises around vaccine supply and delivery, as well as his administration's reluctance to make commitments to share excess vaccine with the world because of concerns about potential setbacks such as this.“They're clearly trying to reassure people there will be supply, and it will be safe,” said former White House communications director Jennifer Palmieri.“You don't want this to have happened, but in terms of what are your tools when it does, they used their best ones — the president, the most senior person who has credibility and the top experts — to do it.”Due to supply issues, the J&J shot reflects just a small share of doses being administered, though it had been one of the most promising vaccines given its ease of administration and distribution. Zients said the U.S. still expects to take delivery of enough doses of the other two approved vaccines for every adult American to get their shots by the end of May.Moderna and Pfizer this week are delivering 28 million doses to the federal government — enough to exceed even the current 3 million shot-per-day pace.Zients acknowledged that some states may have been caught off guard by Tuesday's announcement but said that reflected the speed with which officials moved to address the safety concerns. He added it was proof of Biden's commitment to “follow the science” in responding to the pandemic.“We want the science agencies to lead with science,” Zients said, saying no one at the White House was involved in the decision to call for the pause. “There's no reason for us to be involved in any of the scientific decisions, we bring nothing to the table.”The agencies said Tuesday they were investigating unusual clots that occurred in six women, of the more than 7.2 million adults who've received the shot. One of the patients died and another remains hospitalised in serious condition.Officials said the delay had as much to do with educating physicians about the unique way the clots have to be treated as their desire to study the exceedingly rare side effect. The usual treatment, with the blood thinner heparin, could lead to dangerous patient outcomes, they said.Fauci, speaking at the White House, advised those who had recently gotten J&J shots not to “get an anxiety reaction, because remember it's less than one in a million.” He added, “However, having said that, pay attention” to potential symptoms of the clot including severe headaches, abdominal or leg pain, and shortness of breath.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-says-pause-on-johnson-johnson-shots-shows-govt-putting-safety-1st-101618389468024.html

During a private event held at Windsor Castle on Tuesday, the Queen accepted her former royal aide's wand and office insignia."Earl Peel had an audience of The Queen today, delivered up his Wand and Insignia of Office as Lord Chamberlain and the Badge of Chancellor of the Royal Victorian Order and took leave upon relinquishing his appointment as Lord Chamberlain, when Her Majesty invested him with the Royal Victorian Chain," read the details in the Court Circular, a daily list of the official events attended by the Queen and the royal family.While the UK's national mourning after the passing of Prince Philip last Friday will run until the morning after his funeral at St George’s Chapel in Windsor Castle on Saturday, the royal family is observing two weeks of mourning.A royal official said members of the family would continue to undertake engagements "appropriate to the circumstances".Over the weekend, Prince Andrew – the Queen’s son, said his father’s death had left a “huge void” in his mother’s life.Earl Peel would have overseen the funeral arrangements – referred to as Operation Forth Bridge – before handing responsibility to his successor a week before his death.Former MI5 spy chief Baron Parker has been in place as the new Lord Chamberlain since April 1 and will be in overall charge of Saturday's funeral.Coronavirus lockdown measures mean only 30 people are able to attend the Royal Ceremonial event, which will include the Queen’s close family. Inside the chapel, the royal family will wear face masks and keep to social distancing rules.Under the plans released by Buckingham Palace, the Duke of Edinburgh’s coffin will be carried to the chapel on a specially-modified Land Rover, which he helped to design.His eldest son, Prince Charles – the Prince of Wales – and members of the royal family will take part in the procession on foot, immediately behind the coffin, together with staff from Prince Philip's household.Prince Harry has flown in from the US for his grandfather’s funeral. He, and older brother Prince William, had released their tribute statements reflecting on the late Duke’s service as the longest-serving monarch’s consort in British history.William said the Duke's "century of life was defined by service – to his country and Commonwealth, to his wife and Queen, and to our family"."Like many of you who have lost a loved one or grandparent over the pain of this past year, he was my grandpa: master of the barbecue, legend of banter, and cheeky right 'til the end," said Harry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/queen-returns-to-royal-duties-after-husband-prince-philip-death-101618389012948.html

If followed, we can keep our daily activities moving. There is a rumour that the government is planning to impose lockdown very soon; the government doesn't want to impose lockdown but we should take reference of other countries, mainly in Europe - the developed ones had to impose lockdown with the surge in cases in order to get protected from the first and second wave of infection. We want other measures to be adopted from now so that we don't have to impose lockdown through our awareness and keep the condition under our control," Prime Minister Oli said.Cases of Covid-19 have been increasing in recent days in Nepal by about 100 each day. Till Wednesday morning a total of 2,321,670 tests using the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) method had been carried out.Nepal currently hosts active cases of 3,608 with the total number of infections standing at 280,984. A total of 274,318 people have recovered while 3,058 people have succumbed to the virus.Prime Minister Oli claimed that the government was able to make extraordinary achievements in the past year despite the adverse situation created by the Covid-19 pandemic.In his address to the nation on Wednesday, Oli said that his government was able to raise hope among people at a time when there was huge pessimism.He also claimed that the government was able to maintain the rapid pace of development by building five kilometres of blacktopped road each day and 12 houses a day on average. He also announced increasing the elderly allowances from the new fiscal year."Talking about the railways, we have brought two rails in Janakpur and would operationalise it within this month," Oli said.He further said that the government's move to introduce a social security scheme was part of its achievement. He said that over six million people have already become part of this scheme.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nepal-pm-oli-warns-of-lockdown-if-coronavirus-cases-surge-101618387900578.html
14-04-2021||World||'Prime suspect' arrested in 1996 disappearance of college student Kristin Smart||Paul Flores was the last person seen with Kristin Smart before she vanished from a college campus on California’s scenic Central Coast nearly 25 years ago and suspicion has followed him ever since.He went from being a “person of interest” to a “suspect” to “the prime suspect.”Investigators never had enough evidence to charge him with a crime related to her disappearance until Tuesday when Flores was arrested on suspicion of murder in Smart's death. His father, Ruben Flores, was arrested as an accessory to the crime.San Luis Obispo County Sheriff Ian Parkinson said arrests came after a search of the elder Flores' home last month using ground-penetrating radar and cadaver dogs turned up new evidence linked to Smart's killing, though her body has not yet been located.“Until we return Kristin to (her family) this is not over," Parkinson said.Smart, 19, of Stockton, was last seen May 25, 1996, while returning to her dorm at California Polytechnic State University campus in San Luis Obispo after an off-campus party. Flores, a fellow freshman at the school at the time, had offered to walk her home.Smart’s family issued a statement saying it was a bittersweet day they had long waited for and a first step toward bringing their daughter home.“While Kristin’s loving spirit will always live in our hearts, our life without her hugs, laughs and smiles is a heartache that never abates,” they said. “The knowledge that a father and son, despite our desperate pleas for help, could have withheld this horrible secret for nearly 25 years, denying us the chance to lay our daughter to rest, is an unrelenting and unforgiving pain.”Flores, 44, was arrested at his home in the San Pedro area of Los Angeles and taken to a police car in handcuffs wearing pajama bottoms and a surf T-shirt. His father, Ruben Flores, 80, was arrested at his Arroyo Grande home — about 15 miles (24 kilometers) south of the university — where sheriff’s investigators conducted a new search for evidence.Paul Flores has been under suspicion almost from the start, but the case picked up steam in the past couple years after Parkinson ordered a thorough review of the evidence and a fulltime cold case detective was hired.New witnesses came forward and warrants allowed investigators to intercept and monitor Paul Flores' phone and text messages and search his own home, along with those of his mother, father and sister that turned up new evidence, Parkinson said. He declined to offer more details because search warrants are sealed.Parkinson also credited the podcast “Your Own Backyard" for giving the case renewed widespread attention that led to a key witness coming forward.The podcast's creator, Chris Lambert, was a musician who grew up in the area and was intrigued by a billboard offering a $75,000 reward for information leading to Smart.“Driving past that billboard was a periodic reminder that, oh yeah, they still haven’t found that girl,” Lambert said in a video posted on the podcast website. ”It's different when somebody goes missing in your own backyard."Parkinson held his news conference on the university campus, gesturing over his shoulder to the place nearby where Smart was last seen alive with Flores. He acknowledged missteps by law enforcement hampered the investigation.Smart wasn’t reported missing until three days after she was last seen. A dorm mate at the time said police were initially reluctant to take a missing persons report because it was Memorial Day weekend and she might have left the campus.Smart’s family said in their statement that “an indifference and lack of resolve we experienced early on set the course for many years.”The Smart family filed a $40 million lawsuit in 1996 against Paul Flores and added the the university for allegedly not protecting their daughter. The case has been stayed awaiting a criminal case outcome, a family spokesman said.The case was originally handled by Cal Poly police and the district attorney’s office. Sheriff’s investigators didn’t get involved until a month later.“There really is no hiding the fact that there was mistakes made early on and it made it much more difficult,” Parkinson said. “You know that first 48 hours is pretty critical in a missing person or a homicide.”Parkinson likened the case to a puzzle where missing pieces are located, leading to new evidence and locations to search that then revealed other information."It’s a very slow process to find each of those little pieces,” he said.They served over 40 search warrants at 16 locations over the years, collected nearly 200 new items of evidence and used modern DNA techniques to test more than three dozen older pieces of evidence. So much evidence was compiled that it would fill three terabytes on a computer hard drive, he said.Paul Flores has remained mum through the years, invoking his Fifth Amendment right to not answer questions before a grand jury and in a deposition for the lawsuit brought against him.Flores had nothing to say when arrested, Parkinson said.He was held without bail. His lawyer, Robert Sanger, declined to comment.Ruben Flores was being held on $250,000 bail. His lawyer, Harold Mesick, didn't immediately return an email message seeking comment from The Associated Press but he told the Los Angeles Times that his client was “absolutely innocent.”After Flores was arrested at his Arroyo Grande home, investigators executed a new search warrant. A coroner's tent was set up outside and radar was used to search the grounds. The sound of power saws and drills whined in the background as they searched under a large deck and in the garage.The mayor of Arroyo Grande said the arrests had brought a sense of relief to the city of about 18,000 people that sits just inland from the scenic Central Coast.“The disappearance of Kristin Smart has weighed heavily on the hearts of the people of Arroyo Grande all this time,” Mayor Caren Ray Russom said. “She was never forgotten here, and many, many of us have closely followed this case for decades. ... I sincerely hope that these arrests will result in justice and closure for the Smart family.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/prime-suspect-arrested-in-1996-disappearance-of-college-student-kristin-smart-101618386752054.html

The health agencies in the US said Tuesday they were investigating unusual clots in these patients who've received the Johnson & Johnson shot. One of the patients died and another remains hospitalised in serious condition, AP reported.Following the recommendation of US agencies, South Africa also temporarily suspended the use of Johnson & Johnson vaccines citing concerns about rare and severe blood clotting side effects.More than 289,000 people have received the Johnson & Johnson inoculations in South Africa and no adverse blood clotting side effects have been recorded as a result of the vaccine, health minister Zweli Mkhize was quoted as saying by Bloomberg.Meanwhile, health agencies in Italy and Canada are also considering changing the immunisation plan. Italy's AIFA could discuss the possibility of using Johnson & Johnson's (J&J) Covid-19 vaccine only for people over the age of 60, the head of the medicines agency reportedly told a paper on Wednesday, according to Reuters."We'll see what it's best use will be. We could discuss the possibility of reserving these (J&J) doses to people over the age of 60 since (blood clot) cases are again concentrated under the age of 50," AIFA director Nicola Magrini told Il Corriere della Sera newspaper in an interview.Canada too said that it in talks with the pharma firm over the blood clot reports. Canada’s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said a surge in virus variants could threaten progress made so far, Reuters reported.Similar concerns were raised for AstraZeneca Plc Covid-19 shot after three people, who took the vaccine, were hospitalised in Norway with complaints of blood clots, bleeding and low platelet counts last month. AstraZeneca later said that a review of at least 17 million individuals suggested that the vaccine was safe for use and that that the blood clotting events were not related to the shot.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nations-mull-pause-on-johnson-johnson-covid-19-vaccine-over-blood-clot-reports-101618385297950.html
14-04-2021||World||French Senate clears controversial “separatism bill”||Lawmakers in the French parliament’s upper house this week approved a tougher version of a controversial bill that the government says aims to safeguard France from radical Islamists but which critics fear could be anti-Islamic, according to local media reports. After two weeks of intense debate, lawmakers voted 208-109 to reportedly clear the new version of the bill titled “Supporting respect for the principles of the Republic”. A commission made up of seven MPs of France’s National Assembly, which is the lower house, and seven senators will now try to come to an agreement on the final text of the bill in order to take it forward, according to Le Figaro newspaper. The National Assembly will have the final say in signing the bill into law. The earlier version of the bill - widely referred to as “separatism bill” - was first approved by the lower house back in February. The government maintains the bill is intended to crack down on hate speech and actions by religious figures and organisations that are seen as subverting core values of the French republic. It allows the government to close religious organisations and places of worship if they are found to air “theories or ideas” that “provoke hate or violence”, according to reports. Many critics, however, see the new law as perhaps xenophobic and part of French President Emmanuel Macron’s tilt towards the far-right ahead of next year’s elections, especially since a controversial remark he had made in the aftermath of several terror attacks in France last year. “Islam is a religion that is in crisis all over the world,” he had said, drawing fierce criticism at home and abroad. The bill comes in the backdrop of France suffering a number of Islamist terror attacks last year. Among the prominent ones were the beheading of Samuel Paty, a teacher, who had allegedly showed his pupils cartoons of Prophet Muhammad in October; a knife assault outside the former offices of the satirical magazine, Charlie Hebdo, also in October; and the deadly stabbings at a church in Nice in September. The text of the bill doesn’t mention Islam in order to avoid stigmatising Muslims. France is home to an estimated 5.7 million Muslims. The conservative-controlled Senate backed a series of amendments to the bill with the objective to make the text tougher, including voting to ban hijabs for minors and reinforcing “neutrality” at universities. The Senate also passed last-minute amendments, tabled by interior minister Gérald Darmanin on behalf of the president, which allow a prefecture to oppose the opening of a school “for reasons drawn from France’s international relations or the defence of its sovereignty”, according to Le Figaro. This comes after a recent controversy around the construction of a Muslim school in Albertville, southeastern France, by the Turkish Islamic association Millî Görüş, which has refused to sign the charter of principles of Islam in France, the newspaper reported. Bruno Retailleau, a right-wing senator and president of The Republicans group in the upper house, has urged the National Assembly to pass this tougher version of the bill. “The Senate has largely rewritten the separatism law to make it tougher and to target radical Islam. The French are waiting for these strong measures, the majority of the National Assembly must free itself from the government and take account for these measures themselves,” Retailleau tweeted on Tuesday. Marie-Pierre de la Gontrie of the Socialist Party, meanwhile, said she was opposed to the bill, arguing that the right-wing has transformed it “into an electoral leaflet”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/french-senate-clears-controversial-separatism-bill-101618382624936.html
14-04-2021||World||Japan's Toshiba president steps down amid acquisition talks||The president of Toshiba Corp. stepped down Wednesday, a week after the the Japanese technology and manufacturing conglomerate said it was studying an acquisition proposal from a global fund where he previously worked.Nobuaki Kurumatani tendered his resignation at a board meeting, and the board accepted, effective Wednesday, Tokyo-based Toshiba said in a statement.Kurumatani headed the Japan operations of CVC Capital Partners, which proposed the acquisition last week, before taking his post as chief executive of Toshiba in 2018.Some questions had been raised, both within and outside the Tokyo-based company, about Kurumatani leading the board discussions on the acquisition.The CVC deal is estimated to be worth 2 trillion yen ($18 billion) and will turn Toshiba private. Toshiba said it was giving it “careful consideration.”Trading in the company's shares was suspended when the news hit last week. Shares of Toshiba, whose sprawling business includes making elevators and railways, shot up on the CVC news, and have been trading at nearly 5,000 yen ($46).CVC is a European private equity firm, based in Luxembourg, which has committed nearly $162 billion in funds, managing more than 300 investors. It has declined to comment on the acquisition proposal or the president's resignation.But speculation has been growing other funds may offer better prices.Kurumatani will be replaced as chief executive and president by his predecessor, Satoshi Tsunakawa, who remains on the board, first as COO and currently chairman, Toshiba said.Tsunakawa oversaw some of the recent financial challenges at Toshiba. Before becoming CEO, in his previous stint from 2016, he had headed Toshiba's medical systems business, now a group company of Japanese camera and equipment maker Canon.Toshiba, founded in 1875, was long revered as one of Japan's respected brands, developing the nation's first radar and microwaves, electric rice cookers and laptop computers.It also invented flash memory, the ubiquitous computer chips that store and retain data for digital cameras, cell phones and other gadgets. Toshiba no longer makes laptops, and it has sold its computer chips division.The company's fortunes began to crumble over its heavy investment in nuclear power. After the March 2011 nuclear disaster in Fukushima, costs of the business ballooned because of growing safety concerns. Some nations are turning toward sustainable energy.Toshiba also had massive losses from the nuclear power operations of US manufacturer Westinghouse, which Toshiba acquired in 2006 and which filed for bankruptcy protection in 2017.In Japan, Toshiba is decommissioning nuclear plants, including the one in Fukushima, where the tsunami 10 years ago set off multiple reactor meltdowns.In 2015, Toshiba acknowledged it had been systematically falsifying its books since 2008, as managers tried to meet overly ambitious targets. An outside investigation found it had inflated profits and hid massive expenses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japans-toshiba-president-steps-down-amid-acquisition-talks-101618373262547.html

This enormous build-up that they've made militarily ... to take aggressive action, but we don't know their intentions obviously," the official said.Russia has regularly accused NATO of destabilizing Europe with its troop reinforcements in the Baltics and Poland since the annexation of Crimea.BIDEN'S GOALS FOR SUMMITBiden also reaffirmed a goal to build "a stable and predictable relationship" with Russia and said a meeting in the coming months could address "the full range of issues" facing the two world powers, the statement said.The Kremlin said in its account of the call that Biden told Putin he wanted to normalize relations and to cooperate on arms control, Iran's nuclear program, Afghanistan and climate change. It confirmed Biden had proposed a high level meeting but did not indicate how the Russian leader responded.US Secretary of State Antony Blinken echoed the White House message during talks on the crisis in Brussels with NATO leaders and Ukraine's foreign minister.Blinken also said he would discuss Kyiv's ambitions to one day join NATO - although France and Germany have long worried that bringing the former Soviet republic into the Western alliance would antagonize Russia."The United States is our adversary and does everything it can to undermine Russia's position on the world stage," Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov was quoted as saying by Russian news agencies on Tuesday.His remarks suggest that the diplomatic niceties which the old Cold War enemies have generally sought to observe in recent decades is fraying, and that Russia would robustly push back against what it regards as unacceptable U.S. interference in its geographical sphere of influence.Andrew Weiss, a Russia analyst at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said Biden's exchange with Putin reflected U.S. concern about Ukraine and a desire to work with Russia where they may have common interests."There's an urgent need to send a signal directly to Putin that what Russia is doing in and around Ukraine is dangerous and destabilizing, even as other parts of the administration try not to foreclose cooperation on issues such as the Iran nuclear deal, Afghanistan, climate change and strategic stability."US WARSHIPSTwo US warships are due to arrive in the Black Sea this week in response to what US and NATO officials say is the largest massing of Russian forces - with thousands of combat-ready troops - since Moscow seized Crimea from Ukraine."We warn the United States that it will be better for them to stay far away from Crimea and our Black Sea coast," Ryabkov said. "It will be for their own good. He called the U.S. deployment a provocation designed to test Russian nerves.Blinken met Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba in Brussels after Group of Seven foreign ministers condemned what they said was the unexplained rise in Russian troop numbers.Echoing NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, who met Kuleba earlier, Blinken said Moscow's military actions on Ukraine's doorstep were "very provocative"."Russia must end this military build-up in and around Ukraine, stop its provocations and de-escalate immediately," Stoltenberg said at a news conference with Kuleba.Kyiv has welcomed the show of Western support, but it falls short of Ukraine's desire for full membership of NATO.Kuleba said Kyiv wanted a diplomatic solution, though he also appealed for further economic sanctions against Moscow and more military assistance to Ukraine.Separately, two diplomats said Stoltenberg would chair a video conference with allied defense and foreign ministers on Wednesday. Blinken and US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin were to be present at NATO headquarters to brief the other 29 allies on Ukraine, as well as on Afghanistan, the diplomats said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-proposes-summit-with-vladimir-putin-after-russia-calls-us-adversary-over-ukraine-101618368058785.html
14-04-2021||World||Biden sends unofficial US delegation to Taiwan||President Joe Biden sent an unofficial delegation of former US officials to Taiwan on Wednesday in a signal of support for the democratic island as it faces increasingly hostile moves by China.Taipei said former senator Christopher Dodd and former deputy secretaries of state Richard Armitage and James Steinberg would land in the capital on Wednesday afternoon."Once again this visit demonstrates the firm relationship between Taiwan and the United States," said presidential office spokesman Xavier Chang."It is strong as a rock."Taiwan's 23 million people live under the constant threat of invasion by authoritarian Beijing, which claims the island as its own and has vowed to one day seize it.It uses diplomatic, economic and military pressure to keep Taiwan isolated on the world stage and bristles whenever countries send delegations or maintain contacts with Taiwan.Over the past year, Beijing's sabre-rattling has increased considerably with Chinese fighter jets and nuclear-capable bombers breaching Taiwan's air defence zone on a near-daily basis.A record 25 Chinese military jets and bombers breached Taiwan's defence zone on Monday.Washington has diplomatically recognised Beijing over Taiwan since 1979.But it maintains relations with Taipei and is bound by an act of Congress to sell the island defensive weapons. It also opposes any attempt by China to change Taiwan's future by force.This week's delegation comes on the 42nd anniversary of that legislation -- the Taiwan Relations Act -- which Biden signed when he was a young senator.It also comes after the State Department said on Friday it was issuing new guidelines allowing US officials to meet more easily with Taiwanese counterparts.Biden's predecessor Donald Trump ramped up contacts and visits to Taiwan by US officials as relations between Washington and Beijing plunged over a host of issues.Biden has made clear he wishes to cooperate with China on common causes such as climate change.But concerns about China under President Xi Jinping have become a rare bipartisan issue in Washington and Biden has maintained a tough line with Beijing over its human rights record and threats towards Taiwan.US climate envoy John Kerry will visit China later this week in the first trip there by the Biden administration, seeking to raise global ambitions despite soaring tensions with Beijing on other fronts."We have big disagreements with China on some key issues, absolutely. But climate has to stand alone," Kerry told CNN.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-sends-unofficial-us-delegation-to-taiwan-101618366704798.html

14-04-2021||World||Brazil Senate pushes forward with probe of Prez Bolsonaro's Covid-19 response||Brazil's Senate on Tuesday launched a probe into President Jair Bolsonaro's handling of the Covid-19 pandemic.The congressional investigation, known by its Portuguese acronym as a CPI, can result in a number of actions, including the referral of possible wrongdoing to law enforcement. In practice, the inquiry is a political headache for Bolsonaro, who is already facing record disapproval amid Brazil's worst coronavirus wave.Senate leader Rodrigo Pacheco said on Tuesday that a congressional inquiry into the federal response to the pandemic would be combined with a probe into how federal resources were distributed to states. Some Bolsonaro-aligned lawmakers had pushed for an inquiry to probe how states and municipalities have handled the pandemic, though Pacheco argued such a move could infringe on the jurisdiction of state assemblies.The Covid-19 pandemic is pushing Brazil's medical system to the limit in many parts of the country, partly due to the so-called P1 variant, which many medical experts believe is particularly infectious and deadly.Some 3,808 Brazilians died of Covid-19 on Tuesday alone, according to Health Ministry data, bringing the total death toll to over 358,000, the second highest in the world behind the United States.Moreover, victims are getting younger with over 50% of intensive care beds occupied by patients under 40 years old, according to a study published over the weekend by the Brazilian Association of Intensive Medicine.Bolsonaro has drawn widespread criticism for his approach to the coronavirus, which he has described as a "little flu." He has repeatedly ignored calls of health experts to wear masks and railed against the use of lockdown measures.Angered by attempts to have him investigated, Bolsonaro has blasted lawmakers. A Supreme Court judge ruled last week that enough senators had backed an inquiry into the government's pandemic response to launch the probe despite stalling by Senate leadership.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brazil-senate-pushes-forward-with-probe-of-prez-bolsonaro-s-covid-19-response-101618364630291.html

India-China border “tensions remain high, despite some force pullbacks this year”, the report said, adding: “China’s occupation since May 2020 of contested border areas is the most serious escalation in decades and led to the first lethal border clash between the two countries since 1975.”As of mid-February, “after multiple rounds of talks, both sides were pulling back forces and equipment from some sites along the disputed border”, the report added on the India-China conflict.The US has followed the border conflict closely and condemned China’s aggression in strong terms. It has also expedited certain military supplies requisitioned by India.About others in India’s neighbourhood, the report said that the Myanmar military’s February seizure of power, detention of state counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi, and declaration of a one-year state of emergency “marked a break in that country’s democratic transition and ushered in new societal instability and widespread popular protests”.For Afghanistan, which has become America’s longest war, the report said: “We assess that prospects for a peace deal will remain low during the next year. The Taliban is likely to make gains on the battlefield, and the Afghan Government will struggle to hold the Taliban at bay if the coalition withdraws support”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indiapakistan-crises-likely-to-intensify-china-tensions-still-high-us-intel-101618362034731.html
14-04-2021||World||Cop, police chief resign 2 days after Black motorist's death in Minneapolis||A white police officer who fatally shot a Black man during a traffic stop in a Minneapolis suburb resigned Tuesday, as did the city's police chief — moves that the mayor said he hoped would help heal the community and lead to reconciliation after two nights of protests and unrest.The resignations from Officer Kim Potter and Police Chief Tim Gannon came two days after the death of 20-year-old Daunte Wright in Brooklyn Center. Potter, a 26-year veteran, had been on administrative leave following Sunday’s shooting, which happened as the Minneapolis area was already on edge over the trial of an officer charged in George Floyd’s death.Brooklyn Center Mayor Mike Elliott said at a news conference that the city had been moving toward firing Potter when she resigned. Elliott said he hoped her resignation would “bring some calm to the community,” but that he would keep working toward “full accountability under the law.”“We have to make sure that justice is served, justice is done. Daunte Wright deserves that. His family deserves that,” Elliott said.A decision on whether prosecutors will charge Potter could come as soon as Wednesday. Meanwhile, the cities of Brooklyn Center, Minneapolis and St. Paul imposed 10 p.m. curfews.More than 1,000 protesters gathered again Tuesday at Brooklyn Center's heavily guarded police headquarters, now ringed by concrete barriers and a tall metal fence, and where police in riot gear and National Guard soldiers stood watch. “Murderapolis” was scrawled with black spray paint on a concrete barrier. The group also marched to the Minneapolis office of the FBI, a couple blocks away.“Daunte Wright! Say his name!” the crowd chanted. “No justice, no peace! Prosecute the police!”Gannon has said he believed Potter mistakenly grabbed her gun when she was going for her Taser. She can be heard on her body camera video shouting “Taser! Taser!” However, protesters and Wright's family members say there's no excuse for the shooting and it shows how the justice system is tilted against Blacks, noting Wright was stopped for an expired car registration and ended up dead.Activists who attended the mayor's news conference called for sweeping changes to the Brooklyn Center Police Department and sharply criticized the acting police chief, Tony Gruenig, for not yet having a plan.Elliott said the department has about 49 police officers, none of whom live in Brooklyn Center. He said he didn't have information on racial diversity at hand but that “we have very few people of color in our department.”The modest suburb just north of Minneapolis has seen its demographics shift dramatically in recent years. In 2000, more than 70% of the city was white. Today, a majority of residents are Black, Asian or Hispanic.After stopping Wright for the expired license plates, police tried to arrest him on an outstanding warrant. The warrant was for his failure to appear in court on charges that he fled from officers and possessed a gun without a permit during an encounter with Minneapolis police in June.Body camera footage released Monday shows Wright struggling with police when Potter shouts, “I’ll Tase you! I’ll Tase you! Taser! Taser! Taser!” She draws her weapon after the man breaks free from police outside his car and gets back behind the wheel.After firing a single shot from her handgun, the car speeds away, and Potter says, “Holy (expletive)! I shot him.”Wright died of a gunshot wound to the chest, according to the medical examiner.Protests began within hours.In her one-paragraph letter of resignation, Potter said, “I have loved every minute of being a police officer and serving this community to the best of my ability, but I believe it is in the best interest of the community, the department, and my fellow officers if I resign immediately."Wright’s father, Aubrey Wright, told ABC’s “Good Morning America” that he rejects the explanation that Potter mistook her gun for her Taser.“I lost my son. He’s never coming back. I can’t accept that. A mistake? That doesn’t even sound right. This officer has been on the force for 26 years. I can’t accept that,” he said.Chyna Whitaker, mother of Daunte’s son, said at a news conference that she felt police “stole my son’s dad from him.”The Minnesota Police and Peace Officers Association said in a statement Tuesday that “no conclusions should be made until the investigation is complete.”Prosecutors in Hennepin County, where the shooting occurred, said they have referred the case to nearby Washington County — a practice county attorneys in the Minneapolis area adopted last year in handling police deadly force cases. Washington County Attorney Pete Orput told WCCO-AM that he had received information on the case from state investigators and hoped to have a charging decision on Wednesday. Orput did not immediately respond to a message from The Associated Press.Elliott, the mayor, called for the governor to move the case to the attorney general to prosecute.Asked to comment, John Stiles, spokesman for the attorney general’s office, said the attorney general has confidence in Orput’s review of the case.Ben Crump, the Wright family's attorney, spoke outside the Minneapolis courthouse where a fired police officer is on trial in Floyd’s death. Crump compared Wright’s death to that of Floyd, who was pinned down by police when they tried to arrest him for allegedly passing a counterfeit $20 at a neighborhood market last May.Daunte Wright “was not a threat to them,” Crump said. “Was it the best decision? No. But young people don’t always make the best decisions. As his mother said, he was scared.”Potter has experience with investigations into police shootings. She was the police union president and one of the first officers to respond after Brooklyn Center police fatally shot a man who allegedly tried to stab an officer with a knife in 2019, according to a report from the Hennepin County Attorney's Office.After medics arrived, she told the two officers who shot the man to get into separate squad cars, turn off their body cameras, and not to speak to each other. She accompanied two other officers involved in the shooting while investigators interviewed them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/cop-police-chief-resign-2-days-after-black-motorist-s-death-in-minneapolis-101618361831606.html
14-04-2021||World||Johnson & Johnson’s blood-clot pause to educate doctors, monitor Covid-19 cases: Official||US health officials urged a pause on the use of Johnson & Johnson’s Covid-19 vaccine due to dangerous blood-clotting to give them time to educate doctors on how to treat the exceedingly rare disorder and to “look in all the nooks and crannies” for other cases.That’s the message from Peter Marks, a top official at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, after six women between the ages of 18 and 48 developed severe blood clots in the brain days after getting the one-shot vaccine and federal officials called for a temporary halt in its use. J&J decided to delay rollout of the immunization in Europe and pause all of its Covid-19 vaccine trials.At least one woman died, and a second was in critical condition, out of almost 7 million Americans who received the shot as of Monday, officials said. The normal treatment for clots, the blood-thinner heparin, could make the disorder worse, or even kill a patient, health officials said Tuesday.“Everyone knew it could cause a hit to vaccine confidence,” said Marks, the head of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, speaking Tuesday at an American Medical Association webinar. Though the cases “could just be a statistical aberration,” the health authorities sought to exercise an abundance of caution, he said.The safety signals, he said, were seen between 6 and 13 days after vaccination and were identified by the FDA through a government-run vaccine adverse event reporting system. The clots are called cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, a rare condition that develops in conjunction with low levels of blood platelets.At a briefing earlier in the day, Anne Schuchat, principal deputy director at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said those vaccinated a month ago are at low risk, but people who got it in the last couple of weeks should be on the lookout for headache, leg pain, abdominal pain and shortness of breath.“We expect it to be a matter of days for this pause,” the FDA’s Janet Woodcock said at the briefing.J&J’s decision to pause vaccinations in its Covid-focused clinical trials was also designed to allow it time to update guidance for investigators and participants, the company said in a statement Wednesday evening.6.8 Million DosesMore than 6.8 million doses of the single-shot J&J vaccine have been administered in the US through Monday. Jeff Zients, the White House Covid-19 response coordinator, said the delay won’t have a significant impact on the Biden administration’s vaccination plans.Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. and CVS Health Corp., which have been administering the shot in drugstores, both said they would pause immediately.A number of states on Tuesday also said they would follow the recommendation. New York plans to immunize people who were supposed to receive J&J’s shot with Pfizer’s vaccine at state-run mass vaccination sites. Virginia said it will reschedule appointments.Shereef Elnahal, the CEO of University Hospital and former commissioner of the New Jersey Department of Health, said he’s awaiting further information as to whether younger women or another sub-population are more susceptible to the extremely rare disorder, and whether or not it was caused by the vaccine or mere coincidence.“We are in a limbo period where we just don’t know enough to present all the facts to the community,” Elnahal said in an interview.“This is a vaccine that is very effective for what matters most, preventing hospitalization and death,” he added, noting that if the FDA extended a universal, indefinite pause, it would limit the tools at the health-system’s disposal to curb the pandemic.Crucial JunctureThe decision comes at a crucial juncture in the U.S. vaccination effort, which has gained speed in recent weeks at the same time a worsening outbreak driven by coronavirus variants grips the upper Midwest. It could boost vaccine hesitancy in the U.S. and heighten worry about vaccines globally after similar issues caused delays with AstraZeneca Plc’s shot.Schuchat emphasized at the briefing that the clotting events with low platelet counts are not being seen with Pfizer Inc.-BioNTech SE vaccine and the Moderna Inc. shot.J&J shares closed down 1.3% at $159.48 in New York trading.No definitive cause for the disorder has yet been determined, according to Marks, who said it was very similar to blood clotting incidents seen with the AstraZeneca Plc vaccine. It may be tied to an immune response after vaccination that leads to an activation of platelets and clotting, he said.The J&J shot has been popular due to its single dose while the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines require two doses spaced several weeks apart. Many of the J&J doses in the U.S. have been targeted to harder-to-reach populations through the federal government’s distribution program that works through pharmacies, federally qualified health centers and other locations.“We are recommending a pause in the use of this vaccine out of an abundance of caution,” the CDC and the FDA said in a joint statement Tuesday. The CDC will convene a meeting Wednesday of its Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices to review the cases and assess their potential significance.The FDA will review the CDC assessment as it also investigates these cases, according to the statement.Still, “the potential complications with some of these blood clots is statistically much, much lower than the number of blood clots that we see on an annual basis in this country,” said Mario Ramirez, an emergency medicine physician who served as acting director of the Department of Health and Human Services’ Office of Global Affairs Office of Pandemic and Emerging Threats under the Obama Administration.“We need to just take a deep breath and give investigators a chance to look at what the data says before we can draw any conclusions,” Ramirez said in an interview with Bloomberg Radio.European RolloutJ&J has recently begun shipments to the European Union. The bloc’s drugs regulator, the European Medicines Agency, didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. J&J said in a statement that it’s decided to delay the rollout of its vaccine in Europe.The EMA said Friday that it is assessing blood clots in people who received the J&J vaccine, after four serious cases of unusual clots accompanied by low blood platelets, one of which was fatal, emerged.On Friday afternoon, FDA spokesperson Abby Capobianco said in an emailed statement that the agency hadn’t found a causal relationship between the J&J vaccine and the six cases of thromboembolic events, and was continuing its assessment of the cases“Our analysis of the data will inform the potential need for regulatory action,” she said. The agency had shared information with the EMA, which became “the basis” of the EU probe, she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/johnson-johnson-s-blood-clot-pause-to-educate-doctors-monitor-covid-19-cases-official-101618359777875.html
14-04-2021||World||Another power crisis looms over Texas as grid faces Crunch again||Texas is again facing a possible power-grid emergency, less than 60 days after widespread blackouts left millions without light and heat for days during a deep winter freeze.The grid operator is asking for conservation and warned it could declare an emergency to bring more power plants online after a mild cold front failed to reduce demand as expected at the same time that 25% of generators are offline for repairs. Wholesale electricity prices jumped as high as 10,000% in some parts of the state.“We don’t anticipate having any outages,” said Bill Magness, Chief Executive Officer of the Electric Reliability Council of Texas. “But it is a day we are seeing tight conditions on the grid.”The warning comes just two months after Texas suffered from catastrophic blackouts during a winter storm that knocked out nearly half of the state’s generation capacity. State lawmakers are now scrambling to put in place a series of market reforms designed to avoid a repeat of the calamity that left more than 100 people dead.Officials at the grid operator, known as Ercot, stressed that Tuesday’s conditions are not a repeat of the February crisis.“This is not an extended winter storm that is going to last five days,” Ercot Vice President of Grid Planning and Operations Woody Rickerson told reporters. “This is a shorter event.”Blackouts would only occur if reserve power supplies fell below 1,000 megawatts from more than 3,0000 now. That’s unlikely, Rickerson said. He acknowledged that Ercot didn’t correctly forecast solar and wind production Tuesday, resulting in the supply tightness. At the same time, the grid operator expected milder weather to reduce demand across Texas but when cooler air stalled in one part of the state, temperatures -- and consumption -- remained higher than expected in large cities including San Antonio and Houston.Many power plants schedule annual maintenance for this time of year, when demand is expected to be lower due to lower temperatures. A few plants were also offline to make repairs related to the February storm, Rickerson said.The average spot on-peak electricity at Ercot’s North Hub jumped more than 10,000% to $1,975.96 a megawatt-hour as of 4 p.m, according to grid data compiled by Genscape. Prices are capped at $2,000 a megawatt hour, after regulators suspended the previous $9,000 cap following the energy crisis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/another-power-crisis-looms-over-texas-as-grid-faces-crunch-again-101618359085199.html
14-04-2021||World||Minnesota police chief, officer Kim Potter quit days after Daunte Wright's death||A white Minnesota police officer who fatally shot a Black man during a traffic stop in a Minneapolis suburb and the city's chief of police resigned Tuesday.Officer Kim Potter and Police Chief Tim Gannon both resigned two days after the death of 20-year-old Daunte Wright in Brooklyn Center. Potter, a 26-year veteran, had been on administrative leave following Sunday’s shooting.Gannon has said he believed Potter mistakenly grabbed her gun when she was going for her Taser. She can be heard on her body camera video shouting “Taser! Taser!”“Whenever, through the line of duty, someone kills another human being, there must be accountability,” Brooklyn Center Mayor Mike Elliott told the “Today” show earlier Tuesday.Activists and some residents say Wright was racially profiled, and his death has sparked two days of clashes between police and protesters. The shooting happened as the Minneapolis area was already on edge over the trial of the first of four police officers in George Floyd’s death.Wright was shot as police were trying to arrest him on an outstanding warrant.“I’ll Tase you! I’ll Tase you! Taser! Taser! Taser!” the officer is heard shouting on her body cam footage released Monday. She draws her weapon after the man breaks free from police outside his car and gets back behind the wheel.After firing a single shot from her handgun, the car speeds away, and the officer is heard saying, “Holy (expletive)! I shot him.”The pressure built Tuesday to fire the suburban Minneapolis police officer who killed a 20-year-old Black man during an altercation after a traffic stop, a shooting authorities said was a tragic mistake but that family members of Daunte Wright and others pointed to as yet the latest example of a broken criminal justice system.Brooklyn Center Mayor Mike Elliott called the shooting in his city “deeply tragic” and said the officer should be fired. Elliott, the city's first Black mayor, announced Monday night that the City Council had fired the city manager and voted to give the mayor's office “command authority” over the police force.“We’re going to do everything we can to ensure that justice is done and our communities are made whole,” Elliott said.The city’s police chief has said he believes the officer, identified as 26-year-veteran Kim Potter, mistakenly grabbed her gun when she was going for her Taser. The officer, who is white, can be heard on her body camera video shouting “Taser! Taser!”Wright’s father, Aubrey Wright, told ABC’s “Good Morning America” on Tuesday that he rejects that explanation.“I lost my son. He’s never coming back. I can’t accept that. A mistake? That doesn’t even sound right. This officer has been on the force for 26 years. I can’t accept that,” he said.Wright's family planned to speak again Tuesday alongside the family of George Floyd at the courthouse where the trial is being held for a former Minneapolis police officer charged in his death. Protests erupted for a second night following Sunday's shooting, heightening anxiety in an area already on edge as the Derek Chauvin trial progresses. Floyd, a Black man, died May 25 after Chauvin, who is white, pressed his knee against Floyd’s neck.Chauvin and three other officers were fired the day after Floyd's death. Potter was placed on administrative leave while the state Bureau of Criminal Apprehension investigates Wright's death.The Minnesota Police and Peace Officers Association, the police union, issued a statement Tuesday saying “no conclusions should be made until the investigation is complete.”Police Chief Tim Gannon on Monday would not say whether Potter would be fired, saying she was entitled to due process.“I think we can watch the video and ascertain whether she will be returning,” the chief said.The advent of social media and body cameras has forced police departments to move much quickly than in the past, said Alex Piquero, chairman of the University of Miami’s sociology department. However, he said that before the Brooklyn Center Police Department fires the officer, it will likely review all evidence, including any other body camera footage and testimony from other officers, so that the dismissal is less vulnerable to any court challenge.“We don’t know why she reached for her firearm instead of her Taser,” Piquero said.Body camera footage Gannon released less than 24 hours after the shooting shows three officers around a stopped car, which authorities said was pulled over because it had expired registration tags. When one officer attempts to handcuff Wright, a second officer tells him he’s being arrested on a warrant. That’s when the struggle begins.Potter can be heard saying: “I’ll Tase you! I’ll Tase you! Taser! Taser! Taser!” She draws her weapon after the man breaks free from police outside his car and gets back behind the wheel. After firing a single shot from her handgun, the car speeds away and the officer is heard saying, “Holy (expletive)! I shot him.”The car traveled several blocks before hitting another vehicle.Wright died of a gunshot wound to the chest, the Hennepin County Medical Examiner’s office.Potter has experience with investigations into police shootings. Potter was one of the first officers to respond after Brooklyn Center police fatally shot a man who allegedly allegedly tried to stab an officer with a knife in August 2019, according to a report from the Hennepin County Attorney's Office.After medics arrived, she told the two officers who shot the man to get into separate squad cars, turn off their body cameras, and not to speak to each other. She was also the police union president for the department and accompanied two other officers involved in the shooting while investigators interviewed them.Court records show Wright was being sought after failing to appear in court on charges that he fled from officers and possessed a gun without a permit during an encounter with Minneapolis police in June.Demonstrators began to gather shortly after the shooting, with some jumping atop police cars.On Monday, hundreds of protesters gathered hours after a dusk-to-dawn curfew was announced by the governor. When protesters wouldn't disperse, police began firing gas canisters and flash-bang grenades, sending clouds wafting over the crowd and chasing some protesters away. Forty people were arrested, Minnesota State Patrol Col. Matt Langer said at a news conference early Tuesday. In Minneapolis, 13 arrests were made, including for burglaries and curfew violations, police said.Brooklyn Center is a modest suburb just north of Minneapolis that has seen its demographics shift dramatically in recent years. In 2000, more than 70% of the city was white. Today, a majority of residents are Black, Asian or Latino.Wright's death prompted protests in other US cities, including in Portland, Oregon, where police said a demonstration turned into a riot Monday night, with some in the crowd throwing rocks and other projectiles at officers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/minnesota-police-chief-officer-kim-potter-quit-days-after-daunte-wright-s-death-101618339567631.html

The site was rocked by a quake followed by a tsunami a decade ago.The US found itself alone backing Japan’s plan to release the water from the Daiichi plant into the Pacific Ocean, with American partners South Korea and Taiwan joining China in criticising the move.The US said the approach appeared to be in line with global standards while the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said it would help ensure the plan is carried out “without an adverse impact on human health and the environment”.“Disposing of the treated water is an unavoidable issue for decommissioning the Fukushima nuclear power plant,” Japan PM Yoshihide Suga said.The Chinese foreign ministry urged the US to treat Tokyo’s decision according to facts, and not according to the country. Foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said the discharge of the water will impact the marine environment.“International authorities and experts have clearly pointed out that the discharge of tritium-contaminated wastewater from the Fukushima nuclear power plant into the ocean will affect the marine environment and the public health of neighbouring countries,” Zhao said.He added that the existing treated wastewater contains other radionuclides and needs to be further purified and treated.The ministry quoted an IAEA report that says “if the wastewater containing tritium from the nuclear plant is discharged into the sea, it will affect the marine environment and people’s health of neighbouring countries”.With inputs from agencies||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-concerned-over-japan-s-decision-to-release-fukushima-wastewater-into-sea-101618319681951.html

The companies say they comply with all laws.A Reuters special report published in February revealed Amazon has for years given preferential treatment to a small group of sellers on its Indian platform and used them to circumvent the country's strict foreign investment regulations. Amazon has said it "does not give preferential treatment to any seller on its marketplace".The Smbhav event will include more than 70 speakers and aims to allow small businesses to learn how to grow their businesses in India - a key growth market for Amazon.The event "puts forth how Amazon and our partners leverage digitisation, technology & our ecosystem to drive infinite possibilities for a Digital India", its website said.In a statement, trader groups including the All India Mobile Retailers Association said the Amazon event was positioning it as a friend and guide to small sellers, but argued small traders had been harmed by discriminatory practices of foreign e-commerce firms.The latest dispute comes as India also considers revising foreign investment rules for e-commerce which could force companies like Amazon to rework the relationships it has with big sellers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/asmbhav-enraged-traders-to-counter-amazon-s-smbhav-2021-101618420796066.html

He said their social network can help ensure an increase in the capacity of ambulances, ventilators and oxygen in hospitals. Along with spreading the message about vaccination and treatment, governors can also spread awareness about AYUSH-related remedies," an official statement said.Vice President Venkaiah Naidu, Union home minister Amit Shah and health minister Harsh Vardhan were present at the video interaction.With 1,84,372 new Covid-19 infections, India on Wednesday smashed all its past records of daily rises and proved the second wave of the pandemic more dangerous than the first wave.Reiterating what the Prime Minister has already told chief ministers in the previous meetings, PM Modi on Wednesday said the feeling of janbhagidari needs to be encouraged more and governors have a crucial role to play in it."Governors are an important pillar of janbhagidari in this battle and their coordination with state governments and guidance to the institutions of state will further strengthen the nation's resolve," he said adding that the Central government is committed to ensuring adequate availability of vaccines. He also mentioned how the Tika Utsav has expanded the inoculation drive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/engage-actively-pm-modi-s-message-to-governors-amid-highest-covid-19-spike-101618420925227.html

If you want development of the constituency, you have to think wisely and vote for the TRS,” KCR said, addressing a rally at Halia town, which is part of the Nagarjunasagar assembly constituency, headed for a by-poll on April 17. The by-election was needed with the death of sitting TRS legislator Nomula Narasimhaiah due to ill-health in January. He cautioned the people against getting carried away by the promises and false propaganda of the opposition parties. “You don’t have to vote going by even my promises. But I request you to judge the performance of the TRS government in the last six years,” he said. Recalling the struggle waged by the TRS to achieve statehood for the Telangana region, KCR said, Telangana was like an orphan before the formation of TRS. “The Congress leaders from Telangana were responsible for the sorry state of affairs in Telangana, when the state was part of combined Andhra Pradesh. Had they worked with commitment for the region, the TRS would not have been born,” he said. He lashed out at veteran Congress leader and former minister K Jana Reddy, who represented Nagarjunasagar constituency in the past and was contesting the elections again. “In his three-decades of experience as a legislator, he could not bring even a degree college to this constituency,” he criticised. The chief minister vowed to complete all the pending lift irrigation schemes, particularly the Nellikal Lift Irrigation Scheme, that would create irrigation facility for a major portion of Nagarjunasagar within the next one and a half year. He also promised to provide Godavari River water to irrigate the ayacut under Nagarjunasagar. He declared that he would not seek votes in the next elections without completing the lift irrigation schemes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/if-you-want-development-vote-for-trs-kcr-tells-voters-in-telangana-101618420612694.html

The number of daily tests has also been increased as in the last 24 hours over one lakh tests have been conducted. Both the increase in the number of tests and the number of daily infections indicate that the spread of the infections is not being contained as 15.92 per cent tests are returning positive.Here is how the Covid-19 situation of the Capital spiralled in April> On March 31, Delhi recorded 1,819 fresh Covid-19 infections. In 2020, the highest daily cases the capital recorded was around 9,000. Far from that mark, Delhi's situation on April 1 seemed under control. On April 1, there were 2,790 fresh infections.> On April 2, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, in a press meet, said the situation was concerning but not as serious as it was before (in 2020).> From April 2 to April 14, daily cases increased without any dip and increased by a thousand every day. On April 2, there were 3,594 cases, which on April 4 breached the 4,000-mark and on April 6, crossed 5,000.> On April 11, the Capital recorded 10,774 fresh infections, crossing the 10,000-mark for the first time ever.> On April 12, there were over 11,000 cases.

During his almost 11-hour long questioning, Deshmukh refuted the charges and said those were an attempt to malign the image of the Maha Vikas Aghadi government of the state.The questioning began at around 10am at the defence research and development organisation (DRDO) guest house in Santacruz (East) where he was summoned by the CBI. At around 9.30pm, Deshmukh left the guest house.Deshmukh denied the allegations raised against him by Singh during questioning and told the officers that they were an attempt to malign the image of the state government, news agency PTI reported, quoting sources. It is not yet known whether he will be interrogated against tomorrow, the news agency reported.Deshmukh resigned from his position on April 5 after the Bombay high court directed CBI to probe into the allegations against him. The CBI has questioned Deshmukh’s two personal assistants (PAs) Sanjeev Palande, Kundan Shinde, former commissioner Param Bir Singh, deputy commissioner police Raju Bhujbal, assistant commissioner of police, Sanjay Patil, former assistant police inspector Sachin Vaze and his two drivers till now.Former top cop Singh and suspended police officer Sachin Waze alleged that Deshmukh had asked them to collect ₹100 crore per month from bars and restaurants, an allegation which the former minister has already denied.The allegations against Deshmukh were raised after after Waze was linked with the security breach near Antilia where an explosive-laden SUV was found on February 25. Waze is also an accused in the death of Mansukh Hiran, the businessman, who apparently owned the SUV. Waze is currently in judicial custody till April 23.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/anil-deshmukh-interrogated-for-8-hours-says-charges-aimed-at-maligning-uddhav-thackeray-govt-101618414827825.html
14-04-2021||India||With 17,282 fresh infections, Delhi records highest ever Covid-19 cases||With 17,282 fresh infections, Delhi on Wednesday recorded highest ever coronavirus diseases (Covid-19) cases, breaking its own previous daily spikes., pushing the cumulative tally to 767,438 cases, officials said.This is the highest ever cases within a day the national capital has seen from the start of the pandemic.In the last 24 hours, the deaths also shot up after 104 fatalities were recorded - the highest seen in the fourth wave of infections in Delhi. A total of 11,540 people have succumbed to the infection so far, according to the health bulletin.In another record spike, Delhi's active cases were logged at 50,736 on Wednesday, against the 43,510 recorded a day earlier.The positivity rate—the proportion of samples that test positive—in the national capital also spiked and was logged at 15.92 %, a sharp rise from 13.14 % a day earlier. Authorities also ramped up the testing and conducted 102,460 tests in the last 24 hours. Out of the tests conducted, 64,544 were RT-PCR tests and 37,916 were Rapid antigen.With a sharp rise in deaths due to the latest surge in Covid-19, crematoriums and burial grounds in the city are struggling to manage resources.Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday termed the Covid-19 situation in Delhi as "worrisome" and issued a stark warning asking people to step out of their homes only if it is urgent.Last month, the CM confirmed that the city-state is witnessing the fourth wave of infections, even as the rest of the country is reeling from the second wave. Kejriwal also said that a lockdown to curb the spread of the disease was not an option but warned of stricter restrictions.Earlier today, health minister Satyendar Jain said that the Covid-19 cases are rising very rapidly every single day and "there is no slow down" in the spread of the pandemic in the national capital.The minister, however, reiterated that lockdown was not a solution to the situation, and advised people to step out only if needed, avoid gatherings, wear masks and follow Covid-19-appropriate behaviour to combat the disease.The minister said the number of beds has been increased in various hospitals, while adding that the city government has again requested the Centre to scale up the number of beds in its hospitals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/with-17-282-fresh-infections-delhi-records-highest-ever-covid-19-cases-101618413630800.html

14-04-2021||India||ISRO espionage case: SC to hear Centre's plea, report on Thursday||The Supreme Court is scheduled to hear on Thursday, the Centre’s plea seeking consideration of the report filed by a high-level committee regarding the role of erring police officials in the 1994 espionage case relating to ISRO scientist Nambi Narayanan who had been acquitted and was eventually awarded ₹50 lakh compensation by the top court.A bench headed by Justice A M Khanwilkar will consider the Centre's application and the report filed by the three-member panel, headed by former top court judge Justice (retd) D K Jain.On April 5, the Centre moved the top court seeking urgent hearing and consideration of the panel's report terming it as a “national issue”.The apex court had appointed the panel on September 14, 2018 while directing the Kerala government to cough up ₹50 lakh compensation for compelling Narayanan to undergo "immense humiliation".It had ordered setting up of the committee to take appropriate steps against the erring officials for causing "tremendous harassment" and "immeasurable anguish" to Narayanan and had directed the Centre and state government to nominate one officer each in the panel.Terming the police action against the ex-scientist of the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) as a "psycho-pathological treatment", the apex court had in September 2018 said that his "liberty and dignity", basic to his human rights, were jeopardised as he was taken into custody and, eventually, despite all the glory of the past, was compelled to face "cynical abhorrence".The espionage case, which had hit the headlines in 1994, pertained to allegations of transfer of certain confidential documents on India's space programme to foreign countries by two scientists and four others, including two Maldivian women The scientist was arrested when the Congress was heading the government in Kerala.The three-member investigation panel submitted its report in a sealed cover to the apex court recently.The CBI, in its probe, had held that the then top police officials in Kerala were responsible for Narayanan's illegal arrest.The case also had its political fallout, with a section in the Congress targeting the then Chief Minister late K Karunakaran over the issue, that eventually led to his resignation.Over a period of almost two-and-a-half years, the panel headed by Justice Jain examined the circumstances leading to the arrest.The 79-year-old former scientist, who was given a clean chit by the CBI, had earlier said that the Kerala police had "fabricated" the case and the technology he was accused to have stolen and sold in the 1994 case did not even exist at that time.Narayanan had approached the apex court against a Kerala High Court judgement that said no action needed to be taken against former DGP Siby Mathews, who was then heading the SIT probe team, and two retired superintendents of police K K Joshua and S Vijayan, who were later held responsible by the CBI for the scientist's illegal arrest."There can be no scintilla of doubt that the appellant, a successful scientist having national reputation, has been compelled to undergo immense humiliation. The lackadaisical attitude of the state police to arrest anyone and put him in police custody has made the appellant to suffer the ignominy,” the apex court had said in its September 2018 order."The dignity of a person gets shocked when psycho-pathological treatment is meted out to him. A human being cries for justice when he feels that the insensible act has crucified his self-respect," the top court had said.It had accepted Narayanan's plea that the authorities, who were responsible for causing such a "harrowing effect" on his mind, should face "legal consequences".The CBI, while giving clean chit to the scientist, had said that Siby Mathews had left "the entire investigation to IB surrendering his duties" and ordered indiscriminate arrest of the scientist and others without adequate evidence being on record.The case had caught attention in October 1994, when Maldivian national Rasheeda was arrested in Thiruvananthapuram for allegedly obtaining secret drawings of ISRO rocket engines to sell to Pakistan.Narayanan, the then director of the cryogenic project at ISRO, was arrested along with the then ISRO Deputy Director D Sasikumaran, and Fousiya Hasan, a Maldivian friend of Rasheeda.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/isro-espionage-case-sc-to-hear-centre-s-plea-report-on-thursday-101618410805497.html

Belagavi reported 107 new infections that took the active case count in the border district to 661.

DGP answers||As Maharashtra is all set to embrace a lockdown-like situation for the coming fortnight till May 1, Maharashtra director-general of police Sanjay Pandey on Wednesday said unlike the lockdown of the last year, this time there will be no provision of movement passes. The state police has also been asked to not use force when citizens are following the guidelines. Movement restriction will be imposed with utmost restraint, the DGP said.Starting from Wednesday 8pm, only essential services will be allowed to function in the state, which will come under Section 144 or CrPC prohibiting the assembly of five or more people at one spot.Essential services, public transport, banking and financial services etc., will be allowed to function.This is the first time after the national lockdown of 2020 that a state is going under restrictions of this level.The coming back of restrictions in Maharashtra has met criticism as traders are opposing the government's decision to shut all shops, dealing with non-essential products and services, in the state, while public transport will remain available. Roadside eateries have been allowed to function only for takeaway services. Saloons, spas, schools, colleges, private coaching classes, beaches, clubs, swimming pools, gyms, drama theatres and cinema halls will remain close during the next 15 days. Shooting for films, television serials, advertisements will also remain halted during this period.The state government has also announced a financial package to cushion the impact of the second lockdown in the state.The curfew in the state comes after days of deliberations on whether restriction can be imposed at this point of time. Night curfew and weekend lockdowns were imposed for a week, but as the rise in the number of cases could not be contained and rose to 60,000 per day, the government and opposition parties agreed on bringing back stricter restrictions.Movement of people will remain curbed in the coming days as no gathering of five or more people will be allowed. But the police have not issued any movement passes this time. Exceptions will be made for emergency cases and decisions will be taken accordingly, police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-janta-curfew-will-you-require-a-movement-pass-dgp-answers-101618409745007.html

You should start preparing to save economy, migrant labourers and small-scale industry," Gandhi was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.He added that he was mocked and was seen as a "fear-mongerer"."Narendra Modi said beat thaali, corona will go. He said bang bells and thaalis. After that, he asked people to take out their mobile phones and switch on flashlights," Gandhi charged at PM Modi.Also read | ‘A tsunami is coming’: Rahul Gandhi warns Centre over coronavirus, economyGandhi said that rather than helping labourers, PM Modi asked them to ring bells.The former Congress chief has maintained that he warned Centre against Covid-19 but “they kept rubbishing it”. Gandhi said, as a result, “disaster followed”. When India had reported 126 infections in total in March last year, Gandhi had said that India should be preparing itself not just for the novel coronavirus but for the economic devastation, which he said is coming as he compared it to a tsunami.“The Indian economy is going to be devastated. You have no idea the painful thing the country has suffered and it is coming. It is like a tsunami is coming,” Rahul Gandhi had said while speaking to reporters.The Congress leader also termed BJP's claims to build "Sonar Bangla" (golden Bengal) as a "mirage" and said the saffron party has nothing to offer except for hatred, violence and dividing people on the basis of language, religion, caste and creed.Gandhi's remarks come in the wake of coronavirus crisis in India which has torpedoed the economy, forced governments to curb public movement by bringing in curfews and brought the daily life to a grinding halt across the country.Also read | ‘Disaster followed’: Rahul Gandhi says he kept warning Centre on Covid-19, economyIndia on Wednesday broke all its previous grim records of coronavirus cases and recorded close to 2 lakh fresh infections.

BJP leader and Union minister Ravi Shankar Prasad had then accused Gandhi of lobbying for pharma companies by asking for arbitrary approval for foreign vaccines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/was-mocked-rahul-gandhi-on-warning-pm-modi-about-covid-19-crisis-in-2020-101618403544021.html

He also said that India would like to work in close cooperation with all countries.Shringla made these comments at a session, ‘Plurilateralism Inc: The future of global governance, at the ongoing Raisina Dialogue 2021 to a panel which had former Prime Minister of Sweden Carl Bildt and OECD Sherpa to the G20 and G7 summits Nicolaus Pinaud.“The Covid crisis has global dimensions, so cooperation is widely needed. The Saarc Summit initiated by PM Modi was a great example of regional cooperation, even if they did not meet eye to eye on political issues,” Shringla said while commenting on the impact of plurilateralism on global cooperation.Also read | India has walked the talk during pandemic: PM Modi at Raisina DialogueMentioning the Quad vaccine collaboration initiative, Shringla said, “More recently, the first Quad Summit announced a vaccine initiative, whereby vaccines manufactured in India, financed by the United States and Japan, would be supplied across the Indo-Pacific with Australian last-mile logistical support.”“The Quad, too, came up with a vaccine diplomacy initiative. India is a part of multiple groupings, including plurilateral, trilateral and so on. The aim is to use these to the maximum effect. As far as we are concerned, we would like to work in close cooperation with all,” Shringla was quoted by news agency ANI as saying.Earlier in the day, India’s external affairs minister S Jaishankar, too, highlighted that the Covid-19 vaccine is one of the 10 areas of focus for the Quad. “On the Quad, we have focused on 10 areas -- vaccine collaboration, higher education, student mobility, climate action, emerging technology, resilient supply-chains, semiconductors, countering disinformation, counter-terrorism and maritime security,” he said.The foreign secretary also said that there is a need for reformed multilateralism and India’s multilateralism gives a voice to more countries. “India has come up with reformed multilateralism, granting a voice to more countries. It is not a rigid system where the status quo persists. Countries form effective mechanisms to find solutions to global problems and issues,” Shringla said.“There is a need for reformed multilateralism. Where it is convenient for India to engage, we will engage, be it in the multilateral or plurilateral format,” he further added.Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated the sixth edition of the Raisina Dialogue, India’s premier conference on geopolitics and geoeconomics, on April 13 (Tuesday).

They want to replicate US Navy carrier battle groups but developing carrier air wing will take time,” Singh said, responding to a question on China deploying aircraft carriers. China currently operates two aircraft carriers --- CV-16 Liaoning and CV-17 Shandong. It is building a third carrier. The US believes that the Chinese footprint in the IOR will grow in the coming years. China is building a third aircraft carrier with a flat deck and its navy will be operating in the Indian Ocean in the coming years, said Admiral Phil Davidson, commander of the US Indo-Pacific Command. India is keeping tabs on China’s aggressive moves in the South China Sea and taking steps to ensure that the Chinese navy doesn’t muscle its way into the Indian Ocean where combat-ready Indian warships are carrying out round-the-clock surveillance for any unusual activity. The Chinese are undoubtedly in the IOR already, said maritime affairs expert Rear Admiral Sudarshan Shrikhande (retd). “They have come here (IOR) to stay, play and have a say. Through sustained and overlapping deployments, potentially more bases and partners; China’s multi- dimensional military power with sea power in the lead is something to think about carefully,” Shrikhande said. Aggressive Chinese naval actions and asymmetric activities undermine the rules- based order and constitute a major challenge, Davidson said. “The Indo-Pacific region is in competition between a closed and authoritarian Beijing vision and the idea of a free and open Indo-Pacific,” the US commander said. Davidson said China sought to exploit the current pandemic with increased military aggression throughout the Indo-Pacific and its intent was to undermine international law and norms.From carrying out naval drills with like-minded countries to reaching out to states in the IOR, the Indian Navy is focusing on checking China’s rising ambitions in the region and sending out a strong message that Beijing’s power play in South China Sea cannot be replicated in the Indian Ocean. The navies of India and the US recently concluded multilateral drills in the eastern IOR. France along with the Quad navies of India, the US, Japan and Australia carried out complex maritime drills to enhance interoperability among their navies from April 5 to April 7. Singh said the Quad started as a consultative grouping and has evolved and grown organically. He said India has a high degree of engagement and interoperability with the navies of the Quad countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/flag-follows-trade-navy-chief-on-china-operating-in-indian-ocean-101618406205791.html

The development comes amid an acute shortage of the drug in the wake of the increased number of Covid-19 cases in the country. At present, there is no uniform price of Remdesivir, as it ranges between ₹900 and ₹5,000 per vial.The demand for Remdesivir has gone up in the past week with a sharp increase in the number of infections. The minister said the government has given an approval for seven additional sites with a production capacity of 10 lakh vials per month. This will add to the present capacity of producing 38.80 lakh vials per month. As another 30 lakh vial per month production is lined up, the present capacity will soon be doubled to 78 lakh vials per month.On April 11, the government banned the export of Remdesivir and about 4 lakh vials were immediately diverted for domestic requirement."The current spike in Covid-19 cases has led to a higher demand of Remdesivir. We are currently producing Remdesivir at three of our facilities. To cater to the demand we have ramped up our production from the earlier 5-6 lakh vials a month to 10-12 lakh vials a month, which we will scale towards 20 lakh vials a month.” a Zydus Cadila spokesperson told PTI.Dr Reddy's too said it has slashed the price by 50 per cent to make it accessible to all.Apart from the export ban and ramping up the production, the government on Tuesday ordered that Remsesivir should not be used indiscriminately by patients who are being treated at home, and whose condition is not serious.

14-04-2021||India||'National lockdown not needed but...': Immunisation advisory group chairman on containing Covid-19||The chairman of the Covid-19 working group of the National Technical Advisory Group of Immunisation (NTAGI), Dr NK Arora, on Wednesday warned against political rallies and religious events saying they could act as super-spreaders which could further worsen the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) crisis the nation finds itself in currently.India recorded the highest-single day jump of 184,372 new Covid-19 cases on Wednesday taking the tally of total cases past 13.87 million. On Wednesday, the nation also recorded 1,027 deaths taking the death toll to 172,085.Arora pointed out that mass agitations and religious events need to be curbed. Terming the ongoing farmer’s agitation unfortunate, he said that fear in people’s minds regarding the pandemic has disappeared. “Non-essential things need to be halted. Religious, cultural and political events including the farmers' agitation are being held which is unfortunate. It is necessary to curb these. One of the primary reasons behind the spread is that the fear of Covid-19 among people has disappeared,” NK Arora was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.Arora also said that imposition of lockdown at micro-levels is necessary to strengthen the health facilities in order to cope with rising cases. “We need to focus on how the virus is spreading big cities as well as Tier II and III cities as well. When we impose lockdown at a micro-level we also should strengthen our facilities and extend the lockdown if facilities are collapsing,” he further added.Arora highlighted that there is no need for a national lockdown but there is a need for a reduction of contact between people. He further added that lockdowns can be restricted to small areas. “We need to impose lockdown measures in a selective region like a part of a district. We have experienced a lockdown and since daily cases are touching almost 2 lakhs per day we need to bank on the experience of our past,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/national-lockdown-not-needed-but-nk-arora-on-containing-covid19-101618404464858.html
14-04-2021||India||Muslim women have right to invoke extra-judical divorce, rules Kerala HC as it overturns 1972 judgment||Overruling a nearly five-decade judgment, the Kerala High Court has restored the rights of Muslim women for divorce without resorting to judicial proceedings.A division bench of the high court pronounced the judgment in a bunch of cases that arose out of different proceedings before the family courts seeking varied relief.The bench overruled a 1972 ruling of the single bench of the court barring Muslim women from resorting to extra-judicial modes of dissolving marriage.Noting that the Holy Quran recognises the right to divorce equally for both men and women, the bench observed that the dilemma of Muslim women, particularly in the State of Kerala, came to the fore when the single bench in the 'K C Moyin versus Nafeesa and Others' case negated the right of Muslim women to invoke extra-judicial divorce in the light of the Dissolution of Muslim Marriages Act, 1939. The single bench then had held under no circumstances, a Muslim marriage can be dissolved at the instance of the wife, except in accordance with the provisions of the Act. In its judgment, the division bench of Justices A Muhamed Mustaque and C S Dias analysed four major forms of dissolution of marriages as recognised under Islamic Law and protected under the Shariat Act at the instance of the wife.This includes Talaq-e-tafwiz, Khula, Mubara'at and Faskh."On an overall analysis of the scheme of the Shariat Act as well as the Dissolution of Muslim Marriages Act as above, we are of the considered view that the Dissolution of Muslim Marriages Act restrict Muslim women to annul their marriage invoking Faskh except through the intervention of the Court.""All other forms of extra-judicial divorce as referred in Section 2 of the Shariat Act are thus available to a Muslim women. We, therefore, hold that the law declared in K C Moyin's case (supra) is not good law," the court said in its judgment on April 9.While Talaq-e-tafwiz allows the wife to dissolve the marriage if her husband fails to keep his end of the marriage contract, - Khula allows her to unilaterally divorce her husband by returning his dower.Mubara'at deals with dissolution by mutual consent while Faskh allows dissolution with the intervention of a third person such as a qazi.On the jurisdiction of family court in matters related to extra-judicial divorce, the division bench noted that Explanation (b) of Section 7(1) of the Family Courts Act, confers the family court with the jurisdiction to declare the matrimonial status of any person. It said there is no difficulty for the family court to endorse an extra-judicial divorce to declare the matrimonial status of a person.The division bench said in the matter of talaq, khula, mubara'at, talaq-e-tafwiz, the family courts shall entertain such applications moved by either of the parties or both parties to declare the marital status of such parties.It said in the matter of unilateral dissolution of marriage, invoking khula and talaq, the scope of inquiry before the family courts is limited."In such proceedings, the court shall record the khula or talaq to declare the marital status of the parties after due notice to other parties. If any person wants to contest the effectiveness of khula or talaq, it is open for such aggrieved persons to contest the same in appropriate manner known under law," it said.The court said in the matter of mubara'at and talaq-e-tafwiz, on being satisfied that the dissolution is being effected on mutual consent, the family court without further inquiry shall declare the marital status."We notice family courts are overburdened with a large number of cases. The family court therefore, shall restrain from adjudicating upon such extra-judicial divorce unless it is called upon to decide its validity in appropriate manner.""The family court in such matters shall endeavour to dispose of the cases treating it as uncontested matter, without any delay by passing a formal order declaring the marital status," the court said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/muslim-women-have-right-to-invoke-extra-judical-divorce-rules-kerala-hc-as-it-overturns-1972-judgment-101618404114394.html

Police have so far arrested nine persons in 24 cases registered across the state.“No one can take law in their hands. Violence cannot continue in a civilized society. I have directed the police to take action and arrest the culprits involved in violence without consideration of their political affiliations. I appeal to people to maintain peace and tranquility,” Deb told reporters over the phone from his residence, where he has been isolated since April 9 after testing Covid-19 positive. Over two dozen incidents of violence reported in the last four days from three districts. State police have registered FIRs in 24 cases so far. After the Tripura Tribal Areas Autonomous District Council (TTAADC) poll results were declared on April 10, prohibitory orders were issued in Mohanpur and Jirania of West District, Tulashikhar RD block, Padmabil RD block, Uttar Maharani, Laksha Chandra Para and Duski areas in Khowai district and entire area of Gomati district following reports of violence. A special team of Tripura State Rifles (TSR) and Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) personnel was formed on the day of the results to maintain law and order. Pradyot Kishore Debbarma’s TIPRA Motha party swept the council polls by winning 18 of the 28 TTAADC seats. BJP won 9 seats and one seat was won by an independent candidate. The Communist Party of India (Marxist) or CPM, which ruled the council for three straight terms, returned a blank. The remaining two seats in the 30-member council will be nominated by the governor. Right after winning the polls, Pradyot Kishore suspended victory rallies and urged his supporters to maintain peace. BJP spokesperson Nabendu Bhattacharya accused TIPRA Motha of attacking saffron activists, ransacking their offices, forcing party workers to seek shelter somewhere else. “At least 25 cases related to post-poll violence were lodged in different police stations of the state. Of the total, 23 are against TIPRA Motha, one against CPM and one against the BJP,” said Bhattacharya. Police said that they were probing 24 post-poll violence-related cases and nine people had been arrested so far. “Most of the cases were lodged against TIPRA Motha. We have arrested nine people including seven prime accused persons,” said assistant inspector general of police (IGP) Subrata Chakraborty.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tripura-9-held-in-24-post-poll-violence-cases-cm-calls-for-sparing-none-101618404106877.html

It is the job of states to provide vaccine doses at the vaccination centres in a time-bound manner with meticulous planning," Harsh Vardhan said, reported news agency ANI.In the last few days, several states have reached out to the Centre for assistance as many claimed that their stocks will not last for long. Responding to the requests and concerns, the Union health minister previously said the country has enough doses and urged state governments to put an end to “fear-mongering”.The list of states which have flagged the shortage and sought re-stocking from the Centre includes Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Odisha, Andhra Pradesh, Punjab, Delhi, Rajasthan, Jharkhand, Uttarakhand and Assam.While Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Odisha, Andhra Pradesh and Jharkhand complained that they are facing a shortage of vaccines last week, reports emerged from several other states that vaccine centres were shutting early or turning people away due to supplies running out.The reports of shortage come amid mass Covid-19 vaccination drive ‘Tika Utsav’ launch by Prime Minister Narendra Modi which began on Sunday across the country.Officials said that in places such as Nainital and Tehri Garhwal in Uttarakhand, Rajsamand and Pratapgarh in Rajasthan, Sitara and Panvel in Maharashtra and Morena in Madhya Pradesh, the drive had to be stopped midway as centres ran out of stock.Also read: 10 states face severe Covid-19 vaccine shortage. Here's a listShortages were also reported from other places such Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand and Bihar, forcing state governments to scale down their daily vaccination targets.The health minister said that the country is facing a shortage of key drug remdesivir in its fight against the virus but the manufacturers have been asked to amp up the production."The shortage of remdesivir happened because its production was reduced as Covid-19 cases were decreasing. Our drug controller and ministry held a meeting with stakeholders and asked manufacturers to strengthen the production," Harsh Vardhan was quoted as saying by ANI.On reports of black-marketing of the drug, the Union minister said action will be taken against those indulging in exploitation, black marketing and creating an artificial shortage of remdesivir."The Drugs Controller General of India (DGCI) has directed for strict action into any complaint of black marketing of remdesivir. Those who are exploiting people and creating an artificial shortage of medicine, strict action should be taken against them," he said, reported ANI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-again-denies-vaccine-shortage-as-indian-states-stare-at-stock-crisis-101618399219452.html

I can say that after the elections are over, BJP will not even get 70 out of total of 294 seats", she said.The Trinamool Congress leader charged that the BJP was spreading falsehood by telling different things at different places on the same issue.Banerjee said home minister Amit Shah had said in Lebong in Darjeeling that there will be no NRC. However she pointed out that 14 lakh people have been identified and sent to detention camps based on a process to find illegal migrants under the National Register of Citizens.14 lakh people have been asked to go to the detention camps", she pointed out.Banerjee said if TMC is voted to power once again, it would not allow the controversial National Register of Citizens(NRC) to be implemented in West Bengal.

14-04-2021||India||Ambedkar had proposed Sanskrit as official language: CJI Sharad Bobde||Chief Justice of India Sharad Bobde on Wednesday said B R Ambedkar had proposed Sanskrit as the "official national language" of India as he understood the political and social issues well and knew what the people wanted.The CJI also said the ancient Indian text "Nyayshastra" is "not a bit" inferior to Aristotle and the Persian system of logic, and "there is no reason why we should forsake, overlook, and not benefit from the geniuses of our ancestors".CJI Bobde was speaking at the inauguration of the academic building of the Maharashtra National Law University (MNLU) here in Maharashtra.Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackrey, Union minister and Nagpur MP Nitin Gadkari and others participated in this event virtually.Remembering B R Ambedkar on his 130th birth anniversary, the CJI said, "Today morning, I was in a fix about which language should I deliver this speech. Today is the birth anniversary of Dr Ambedkar which reminds me that the conflict between the language to be used while speaking and the language to be used during work is very old".He said the Supreme Court gets many representations on what should be the language of subordinate courts, but I feel this subject is not being looked into."But Dr Ambedkar had anticipated this aspect and he had mooted a proposal saying that the official language of the Union of India should be Sanskrit," the CJI said.The CJI said he cannot recall whether that proposal, which had signatures of some Maulvis, pandits, priests and Ambdekar, was tabled (in the constituent Assembly)."It was Ambedkar's opinion that since Tamil is not acceptable in north India it might be opposed there and likewise Hindi will be opposed in south India. But, there is less possibility of opposition to Sanskrit in north India or south India and hence he had mooted that proposal, but it did not succeed," CJI Bobde said.The chief justice of India said Ambedkar possessed knowledge of not only about the law but he also knew social and political issues very well."He knew what the people, the poor of the country wanted. He had full knowledge about all these aspects and I feel that is why he thought of putting up this proposal," the CJI said.He said the law school is a nursery of the legal profession."Law school is the nursery from which springs forth the harvest of our legal profession as well as judges. Dreams of many people have come true with the Maharashtra National Law University (MNLU)," the CJI said.He further said the MNLU intended to "impart a national outlook to students and faculty who are drawn from all over the country"."There is no regionalism and no narrow-mindedness and this distinguishes a national law university from any other kind," he said.CJI Bobde said two unique courses are taught at the MNLU including a course that will produce judges much on the lines of the National Defence Academy (NDA) which not only produces soldiers but officers, and the other course is on 'Nyayshastra'."The Indian judicial system was inherited from the British which uses logic and the origin of logic is Aristotle. But the 'Nyayshastra' which was developed in India is not the least bit inferior to Aristotle or the Persian system of logic."I see no reason why we should forsake, overlook and not benefit from the geniuses of our ancestors and that is how this course began which is unique," CJI Bobde said.The CJI is set to retire on April 23. He will be succeeded by Justice NV Ramana as his successor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ambedkar-had-proposed-sanskrit-as-official-language-cji-sharad-bobde-101618396287344.html

It is because of that strong belief that so many people have come here to take a dip in Ganga," Siddharth Chakrapani, a member of one of the Kumbh Mela organising committees, told AFP."They believe that Maa (mother) Ganga will save them from this pandemic."Of some 50,000 samples taken from people in Haridwar, 408 tested positive on Monday and 594 on Tuesday, the Uttarakhand state government said.The latest figures came as Yogi Adityanath, the chief minister of neighbouring state of Uttar Pradesh, tweeted on Wednesday that he had tested positive for Covid-19.India overtook Brazil this week to become the country with the second-highest number of Covid-19 cases in the world.The vast nation of 1.3 billion people on Wednesday reported more than 184,000 infections in the past 24 hours -- the biggest single-day rise since the start of the pandemic -- to take the total to almost 13.9 million cases.India's daily death toll passed 1,000 on Wednesday for the first time since mid-October.Local authorities have imposed night curfews and clamped down on movement and activities.In India's financial capital Mumbai, where the Maharashtra state government has imposed tougher lockdown measures, migrant workers at a train station said they were leaving for their homes in other states after the tighter restrictions were announced."Since I don't have any work, I am not able to pay my rent," migrant worker Imraan Khan told AFP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/over-1-000-test-positive-for-covid-19-at-india-s-religious-festival-kumbh-101618395394758.html

The curfew, which exempts essential services, will come into effect from 8 pm on Wednesday."We would continue to remain engaged with the central and the Maharashtra governments, in our efforts to mitigate the economic impact of the 15-day Jantata Curfew in the state."We have also urged the federal and states to reach out to the most vulnerable sections of the industry, particularly in the informal sectors, with the best possible relief," industry body Assocham said in a statement.Assocham said it has approached all the states and the Centre to provide liberal regulatory and financial forbearances for compliances.Fixed charges like electricity dues, lease rentals, licence fees and other levies should be waived, to help businesses maintain continuity, it suggested. Restaurants, hotels, small eateries should be given financial support for retaining the manpower, while the formal sectors of the economy should be engaged for regulatory forbearances, Assocham added.Sebi and other regulators should speed up clearances for those seeking to strengthen their balance sheets by fundraising from the financial markets, it added."With stringent restrictions not only by Maharashtra but several other states, the economic impact is imperative."Ironically, the outbreak of the second wave of the pandemic has come about when the economy was all set for a smart recovery.

We had managed to get hold of the Covid situation, they made it complicated," she said at the public meeting.Speaking on the Election Commission's decision to prohibit her from campaigning for 24 hours, she said, "Is it a fault to ask Hindus, Muslims and others to vote together? What about Prime Minister Narendra Modi who is mocking me at every election meeting? Why is he not banned from campaigning?" she asked.The Election Commission had barred Banerjee from campaigning for 24 hours from Monday 8 pm for her remarks against the central forces and a statement that had alleged religious overtones.Accusing the prime minister and Amit Shah of peddling lies at poll rallies, the TMC supremo said, "The Centre has kept the NRC and the NPR bills alive, but the home minister had claimed at a meeting at Lebong in the hills that he had no plans to enforce the National Register of Citizens.""Don't trust them. If they come to power, you may face the same experience like the 14 lakh Bengalis in Assam (referring to the final NRC in the northeastern state). BJP is a dangerous party which is trying to divide Bengal," she claimed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-brought-outsiders-in-bengal-contributed-to-covid-19-surge-mamata-101618395807255.html

Stressing that India has the right to develop, and its poor have the right to grow, Javadekar said India will walk the talk on climate change as it has already been and raise its ambition based on national circumstances.Javadekar was speaking at a panel organised at the Embassy of France to mark the Official Visit to India of Minister for Europe and Foreign Affairs of France, Jean-Yves Le Drian, to reinforce Indo-French strategic, cultural and economic ties.“You are aware that the objective of the Paris Agreement is to limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius or even 1.5 degrees Celsius by the end of this period compared to pre-industrial levels. If we do not succeed in doing so, the consequences will be disastrous…That’s why it is absolutely indispensable that all countries increase their climate commitments by the time the COP26 [2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference] takes place in Glasgow, as required by the Paris Agreement,” Le Drian said in his address, underlining “This increase in ambition must include setting new nationally determined contributions by 2030 and also long-term strategies to achieve carbon neutrality. We must stop building new coal-based power plants and it is essential that we progressively stop this mode of electricity production at a global level.”Also Read | Russia has independent ties with India and Pakistan, say top Russian diplomatsUnited States Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry also met Javadekar and Prime Minister Narendra Modi last week regarding increasing climate ambition ahead of COP26 in Glasgow this November.“Let me today give some context. Yes, we are suffering. We are seeing higher temperatures, unusual rain, hurricanes, frequency of such abnormal events has increased. But let us not forget that this is not a new phenomenon that has arisen in the past few decades. For 150 years this has been happening, because carbon emissions remain in the atmosphere for more than 150 years, so what we are suffering today was caused 150 years ago. The countries EU, US and in the last 30 to 40 years China, they emitted and therefore the world is suffering, India is suffering,” Javadekar said in his speech following Drian’s address.“In climate debate historic responsibility is a very important aspect. We cannot just forget and we will not allow anybody to forget it. The historical emissions responsibility today of is China 28%, USA 40%; Europe 10% and India is only 3%. We are not responsible for the climate change that is happening but India is a responsible nation. It will do the right thing to deal with climate change. Principle of common but differentiated responsibilities (CBDR, a principle under the Paris Agreement requires richer countries to lead and take historical responsibility for the emissions caused in the past by them.) is important. Yes, as we are facing a grave common threat we all will have to act but those who have polluted will have to act more,” Javadekar added.He said that the commitment of 100 billion dollars per year by 2020, which now adds up to 1.1 trillion dollars has not come through. “Where is the money? There is no money in sight. You have polluted, destroyed the world and brought climate change. And now you are saying don’t use coal. The alternative technology has to be much cheaper than coal only then people will do away with coal. India is not a major emitter. People say in sequence that we are the fourth largest emitter. How? Coal consumption of China is 4 billion tonnes this year. Ours is not even 1 billion tonne. How are we comparing apples with oranges?” he asked.Javadekar urged developed countries to deliver on finance commitments. “They should make technology at an affordable cost. Climate change is not a business. Fighting climate change is our duty. World has agreed to supply anti-AIDS drugs at a lower cost because AIDS is a disaster. We should not profit from a disaster…therefore, we will walk the talk, raise our ambition but not at the behest or pressure from other countries.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-won-t-raise-its-climate-ambition-at-the-behest-of-developed-nations-javadekar-101618390905298.html

At the launch event at Congress headquarters, party spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said that INC TV will start airing shows from April 24 which marks the National Panchayati Raj Day, and would be live for at least 8 hours every day. Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha and All India Congress Committee general secretary Mallikarjun Kharge, NSUI president Neeraj Kundan and Mahila Congress president Sushmita Dev were also present at the launch.Also Read | Rahul Gandhi to begin Bengal campaign today, 3 days ahead of phase 5 votingSpeaking at the press conference, Kharge said that even Ambedkar believed that journalism had become a trade in India and it was the BJP that was proving him right today.He added that Dalits were suffering under BJP and every 11 minutes, there was an attack on a Dalit in India. “This truth of our country has been long concealed. Our nation has the right to hear the truth.

A notice of at least 15 days will be given to the students before the start of the examinations so that there is no inconvenience to the students, the minister said. In this case, the exams will not be conducted before June 15, the Centre has indicated.In a crucial decision taken at a meeting, attended by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the education minister, the government on Wednesday cancelled CBSE class 10 exams 2021 and decided that the result of CBSE class 10 students will be prepared on the basis of an internal assessment which will be devised by the Board. If a candidate is not satisfied with that evaluation, they will be given an opportunity to sit in an exam, if and when exams are held.But for class 12 exams, the situation is trickier as admission to colleges outside India will be partially depending on that. Hence, the government has decided to review the situation once again on June 1, and the new dates will be announced 15 days after the government decides to go ahead with the exams.The situation will be reviewed on 1st June 2021 by the Board, and details will be shared subsequently. A notice of at least 15 days will be given before the start of the examinations.As fresh Covid-19 infections are on the rise, several states are either postponing or cancelling their state board exams. The impact of the second wave of the pandemic is not uniform in the states, but since CBSE is an all-India Board exam, it has to be held simultaneously; the Board can't conduct exams in some states now and in others later.In February, the Central Board of Secondary Education announced the exam dates giving three months time to the students for preparation. The Board also kept the entire date sheet shorter this time — for 39 days. Two-shift exams were also planned.However, with the cases rising sharply, state chief ministers urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to review the situation and find an alternative to conducting exams as that would put students' lives in danger.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cbse-12th-board-exam-2021-when-will-new-dates-be-announced-101618389765862.html

He wrote to Union education minister Ramesh Pokhriyal requesting the cancellation of these exams. The CBSE board are scheduled to be held from May 4 onward.In the letter to Pokhriyal, Singh spoke about the prevailing situation related to the coronavirus infection and stressed, “It would only be appropriate that a decision is taken forthwith to postpone the Class 10 and 12 Board examinations”. He added that this step would also allow the Centre and states to prepare a more robust plan for conducting these exams once the situation normalises.The Punjab chief minister, while seeking the Union education minister’s early intervention into this matter, pointed out that it will be difficult to predict when the surge in infection will see a declining trend, according to a statement. Singh wrote that different states are on different levels of the second wave of the pandemic, with some likely to see a peak a little earlier compared to those where the surge started later.The chief minister also referred to the national Covid-19 figures and said, “The steady increase in Covid-19 cases in most states of the country has created a sense of great apprehension and anguish among the students and their parents alike regarding the board examinations for classes 10 and 12.”In Punjab itself, Singh said the Congress-led state government has been receiving requests from several quarters to postpone board exams for CBSE, ICSE as well as the state board.Singh’s request to the Centre comes a day after his Delhi counterpart Arvind Kejriwal requested the government to cancel board exams over fear that examination centres can turn into Covid-19 hotspots. Addressing a press briefing on Tuesday, Kejriwal said some alternate provisions could be implemented. “Children can be promoted this time based on either an online method or internal assessment. But CBSE exams should be cancelled,” he said.Covid-19 cases in Punjab soared to 279,000 on Tuesday after 3,003 new cases and 53 more deaths were reported in the last 24 hours, according to the state health department’s bulletin.

It is necessary to take drastic steps," said Gehlot."People should understand its seriousness and behave in the same way like they did when the lockdown was imposed the first time," he added.On Sunday, the chief minister had said that the state government will be forced to impose strict measures if people neglect following Covid-19 protocols.

The alleged kingpin of the gang, Firoz Alam, who allegedly instigated the mob, has since been arrested. Kumar was killed as his seven colleagues fled. The Bengal police allegedly did not accompany the raiding team despite several requests. They have rejected the claim saying the team was advised to wait since the local police were busy with the assembly elections.Singh, who met Kumar’s family in Bihar’s Purnia district along with his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) colleague and deputy chief minister Tarkishore Prasad, said the CBI probe will ensure justice. Prasad echoed Singh. “We will discuss the demand for a CBI probe raised by the family [of Ashwini Kumar]... with chief minister Nitish Kumar,” Prasad said. “If voted to power in Bengal, it would be easier for us to recommend...[the] CBI [probe] as...Bengal government’s recommendation is needed for [it]....”The BJP hopes to wrest power from the Trinamool Congress (TMC) in West Bengal after emerging as the second biggest party in the state in the 2019 national polls. The fifth of the eight-phase polling in the state will be held on Saturday before the results are declared on May 2.There was no immediate response from the TMC.Singh said Ashwini Kumar’s seven colleagues, who have been suspended over dereliction of duty pending a probe, will not be spared for abandoning him.Singh and Prasad said they assured Ashwini Kumar’s family of full assistance including funding of the education of his three children.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bihar-minister-blames-mamata-for-patronising-goons-says-bjp-to-order-cbi-probe-into-officer-s-lynching-if-vote-to-power-in-bengal-101618381544169.html

Several opposition parties including the Congress and Arvind Kejriwal’s Aam Aadmi Party have also nudged the central government to defer the exams.In December, the CBSE had deferred the board examinations by a few months to May 2021, insisting that it might not be possible to push the dates any further since the delayed annual examination would have a bearing on college admission dates.But the second wave of the coronavirus infections could cast a shadow on this plan as the country recorded a single-day increase of 184,372 cases on Wednesday while the daily toll surged past 1,000 for the first time in over five months.The continuous surge in Covid-19 cases this week forced the Maharashtra government to postpone Class 10 and 12 exams to be held by the state's examination body. The exams were slated to begin this month.CBSE officials had earlier indicated that they too had an open mind on rescheduling the dates. A senior official told Hindustan Times earlier this week that many state boards had postponed their exams and the CBSE was discussing the situation with the Union ministries concerned. “(We)... will soon take a call if the exams need to be postponed or not,” the official said.Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, who supported the demand from students to postpone the examinations, on Tuesday said the exam centres could turn into Covid-19 hot spots.“CBSE board exams are approaching.

Alarmed over 23 people on its premises, including a 13-year-old girl from Surat, testing positive for Covid-19 recently, temple authorities may also restrict the visit of devotees from other states.Ajay Jena, administrator (development) of Shree Jagannath Temple administration, said 7 servitors and three of their family members, 8 workers engaged at the shoe-stand at the main gate of the temple, a security personnel of Jagannath Temple Police, and a gardener were among those who tested positive.The 13-year-old girl, whose antigen test report came positive, will undergo an RT-PCR test for further confirmation. “All the persons who have tested positive for Covid-19 have been asked to remain in home isolation for 10 days,” said Jena.Though the temple doors are closed for devotees on Sunday, temple authorities are mulling Saturday closure too.“We would take a decision on this on Thursday. Besides, we are going to demand negative RT-PCR report for people coming from other states before allowing them inside,” said an official.Also Read | Union minister proposes collection drive for beautification of Jagannath TempleMeanwhile, Odisha saw 2,267 new cases and a total positivity rate rising from 6.36 to 6.81 on Tuesday. The number of active cases climbed to 12,444. The new cases, detected from all 30 districts, is the highest single-day spike recorded in the state in the last five and half months.Former director of Bhubaneswar AIIMS, Dr. Ashok Mohapatra said if appropriate protocols are not followed, daily cases would rise beyond 10,000. “Though the fatality rate in the second wave of the virus pandemic is comparatively lower from the first phase, the rate of positivity is certainly higher...Right now, the surge is limited to a handful of states. Once the outbreak spreads to other states, the spike will be huge,” he said.Meanwhile, Ganjam district administration shut all religious institutions in the district for the next seven days, beginning April 14. Ganjam district collector Vijaya Amrita Kulange said apart from religious institutions, all public places, such as parks, play grounds, sea beach and lake, would be closed for till April 21 for sanitisation. The celebration of Meru Jatra and Pana Sanskranti would not be held in the district.In Bhubaneswar and Cuttack, the local municipal authorities have restricted religious congregations within the mosque to 100 persons or 50% of hall capacity during the month of Ramzan.Shortage of vaccine doses has also caused alarm. Vaccination could not be held in 11 districts for want of stocks. While vaccination was on in 1,400 centres last week, only 495 centres were operational on Tuesday. Sambalpur, Puri, Jajpur, Bhadrak, Nayagarh, Boudh, Gajapati, Dhenkanal, Koraput, Jharsuguda and Sonepur were the districts where vaccination came to a halt. To be sure, while overall supplies may be there at the state level, individual centres may run out of stock on account of how the states manage their replenishment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amid-rising-covid-cases-odisha-s-jagannath-temple-may-restrict-devotees-from-other-states-101618374885314.html

14-04-2021||India||Puthandu 2021: With curtailed celebrations, Tamil people usher in New Year||People from the Tamilian community across the world are celebrating the Puthandu festival, which marks the beginning of the Tamil New Year.Puthandu's date is set with the solar cycle of the Hindu calendar as the first day of the Tamil month Chithirai, therefore it usually falls on around April 14 of every year on the Gregorian calendar.On this day, Tamil people meet their family members and greet each other by saying "Puthāaṇdu vāazhthugal!" which loosely translates to 'Happy New Year.' People also visit their local temples, light up diya at their home as they welcome a new year.This year, the festival is being celebrated amid a raging second wave of Covid-19, hence festivities have been curbed.Puthandu is widely celebrated in the Tamilian diaspora outside the country as well.On Tuesday, President Ram Nath Kovind took to Twitter to extend his wishes on the occasion. "On the auspicious occasion of Puthandu Pirappu, Rongali Bihu, Naba Barsha and Vaisakhadi, I extend my heartiest congratulations and best wishes to all Indians living in India and abroad,” he wrote on Twitter.Prime Minister Narendra Modi also posted wishes on the micro-blogging site.

14-04-2021||India||CBI looking at not calling witnesses repeatedly to agency office for questioning||The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) is working on a mechanism which will ensure that the witnesses associated with its investigations aren’t summoned repeatedly to the agency office(s) for questioning, people familiar with the development said.The move will help CBI avoid facing allegations of ‘unnecessary harassment’, they said.Witnesses and suspects are called repeatedly, sometimes for consecutive days and weeks, by the investigation officers to seek clarification on a particular case or new developments. Some cases wherein witnesses were called repeatedly include 2G spectrum scam, coal scam cases and other high-profile cases like AgustaWestland scandal, corruption probe against former union minister P Chidambaram, Punjab National Bank scam involving Nirav Modi and Mehul Choksi etc.Without naming the case, an officer cited above said an employee of a public sector bank was called for questioning at least two dozen times in 2018 in a bank fraud case.As part of the new strategy, which is a brainchild of the interim CBI director Praveen Sinha, the CBI will ask its investigating officers (IOs) to do their homework by studying the case thoroughly, collect relevant documentary evidence and analyse it in consultation with the law officers and branch heads before summoning any person, said the first officer cited above.Also Read | CBI to question Anil Deshmukh today over corruption allegationsThe IOs will have to prepare detailed questionnaire covering all aspects that need to be covered during interrogation/examination of a particular witness, and if required, send a questionnaire to the witness in advance as well, said another officer, who also didn’t want to be named.“Obviously, the witnesses can be called as and when there is new evidence in a case but at the beginning of the probe, we should avoid calling people every day to seek clarification on small issues. It should be covered during couple of rounds (of questioning). Calling a person again and again shows poor preparation by the IO and the concerned branch,” said the second officer.Such an exercise, third officer said, will not only help in removing contradictions in the testimony of same person during the trial but also help keep in check any effort by CBI officers to coerce people from giving statements to suit a narrative or extort them.A senior Indian Police Service (IPS) officer had proposed several years ago that CBI should video-record all the statements in every case but the plan never took off as it requires lot of resources and funding.“Video recording is done in certain testimonies but recording every statement is not feasible,” said the third officer.Former CBI joint director Neeraj Kumar said, “Be it CBI, Enforcement Directorate or any other investigation agency, this idea of calling people again and again for questioning should anyway be shunned. This mechanism is in order and there is no debate about it that IOs should do their work in advance before summoning anyone. It’s a welcome step by CBI interim chief”.Advocate Vijay Aggarwal, who is defending several accused in CBI cases including 2G scam, coal scam, former ICICI Bank CEO Chanda Kochhar and others, said - “It is a step in the right direction as in 2G case one of the reasons for acquittal was also delay in recording statement of witnesses as well as multiple statement of the same witnesses. In that case, before the arrest of (former telecom minister) A Raja, witnesses gave one statement, and after the arrest, the same witnesses took a contradictory stand”.“Multiple statements of the same witness give the defence a chance to point out contradictions. In the Akshardham temple attack case of Gujarat, Supreme Court ordered acquittal because of the delay in recording the statement of witnesses. Also, CBI manual 2005 contemplates concept of plan of investigation in Para 14.18. So, if you have a plan then such multiple statements and delay is not required. Though on a lighter note, it would make our (defence counsels’) job a little more difficult,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cbi-not-to-call-witnesses-repeatedly-for-questioning-101618373744859.html

14-04-2021||India||On Ambedkar Jayanti, PM Modi bows to Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar, hails his struggle||On account of Ambedkar Jayanti, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday remembered Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar and hailed his contributions in uplifting the backward sections of the society.“Bowing before Bharat Ratna Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar on his birth anniversary. Their struggle to bring the deprived sections of society into the mainstream will continue to be an example for every generation. I bow to the great Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar on #AmbedkarJayanti,” PM Modi tweeted in Hindi.Dr Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar, the chief architect of the Indian Constitution, was born on April 14, 1891, in Madhya Pradesh’s Mhow. He was appointed as the chairman of the Constitution Drafting Committee for the constitution of independent India on August 29, 1947, and after Independence, Ambedkar was appointed as the law minister of the country.On Tuesday, President Ram Nath Kovind urged citizens to imbibe Dr BR Ambedkar’s ideals in their lives and contribute towards building a strong and prosperous India. “All through his inspiring life, Dr. Ambedkar charted his unique path in the midst of extreme adversity and earned commendations for his extraordinary and multi-faceted achievements,” he said.Kovind hailed Ambedkar as an ardent advocate of human rights, who set up the ‘Bahishkrit Hitakarini Sabha’ with the aim of improving the socio-economic status of the people of deprived communities of India and for the spread of education amongst them. “Dr. Ambedkar envisioned a better and just society and fought for it throughout his life. He wanted to create a modern India where there would be no prejudice on the basis of caste or any other reason; where women and communities subjected to backwardness for centuries would enjoy equity of economic and social rights,” the President said, according to a statement released by his office.Later in the day, PM Modi will virtually address an event hosted by Ahmedabad’s Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar Open University. The Prime Minister will also release four books—Dr. Ambedkar Jivan Darshan, Dr. Ambedkar Vyakti Darshan, Dr Ambedkar Rashtra Darshan, and Dr. Ambedkar Aayam Darshan— based on Baba Saheb Bhimrao Ambedkar's life, written by Shri Kishor Makwana.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/on-ambedkar-jayanti-pm-modi-bows-to-dr-babasaheb-ambedkar-hails-his-struggle-101618367397313.html

This is the first meeting of this kind during the coronavirus disease pandemic and has been convened amid the Centre looking to push for stronger adherence to the pandemic protocols among citizens across the country.The meeting which comes amid the spurt in daily cases in India, is the first direct interaction between the governors and the Prime Minister. Before this, PM Modi has held a meeting with chief ministers of various states and UTs on April 8 over the resurgence of Covid-19 in the country and to discuss vaccination strategy.In the March 8 meeting, PM Modi asked the chief ministers to make the "maximum use" of the offices of governors, saying the move will send a positive message and help bring people from different walks of life together. "Under the leadership of the governor and under the guidance of the chief minister, all states should at least hold all-party meetings and firm up actionable points. This is my request that the governor and the chief ministers should together hold virtual webinars with all the elected representatives," said PM Modi during his virtual interaction with chief ministers."It should start with urban bodies and then rural bodies. The webinars should be with all the elected people. It will send a positive message that it should not be politicised and all of us have to do it together," he added.Last year, in March, President Ram Nath Kovind interacted with governors soon after the Covid-19 breakout in the country. He had asked governors to mobilise voluntary and religious organisations to aid the effort to contain the spread of coronavirus.Meanwhile, the Covid-19 caseload in the country climbed to 13,689,453 as the country continues to record cases in never seen before numbers. On Tuesday, 161,736 people found to be positive of Covid-19 in a span of 24 hours.In the wake of the Covid-19 surge, several states have brought back stringent restrictions in the states to check the spread. On Tuesday, Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray ordered a partial lockdown in the state under which all non-essential activities has been curbed. He also ordered imposition of Section 144 which restricts the movement of people in groups.National capital Delhi is also under night curfew along with various other curbs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vice-president-venkaiah-naidu-pm-modi-to-interact-with-governors-over-covid-19-surge-101618365961142.html

We don't want to totally arrest the economy. The local level isolation of patients, or households which have people in quarantines are the methods through which the crisis will be handled, the second wave will be handled. There shall not be lockdown," she said.She also shared other measures taken by government including distribution of LED bulbs, ethanol blending programme under National Bio Fuel Policy, voluntary vehicle scrapping policy, incentivisation of electric vehicles to achieve green, resilient and inclusive development.Daily average cases across the country crossed 1.5 lakh last week.

14-04-2021||India||'Tika Utsav' ends today, over 25 lakh doses administered on day 3||The four-day-long 'Tika Utsav', started on the suggestion of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, will end on Wednesday. It was started on April 11 to speed up the nationwide vaccination drive and check a resurgent coronavirus disease (Covid-19).More than 25 lakh vaccine doses were administered on the third day of the 'Tika Utsav' on Tuesday, taking the cumulative number of vaccines given in the country so far to 11,10,33,925, the Union health ministry said. On Monday, the second day of the vaccination festival, more than 37 lakh Covid-19 doses were administered to eligible beneficiaries, the health ministry's data showed.On the first day of 'Tika Utsav', nearly 30 lakh vaccine doses were administered and the Covid Vaccination Centres (CVCs) also saw an increase of 18,800.PM Modi called 'Tika Utsav' the beginning of the second big war against the coronavirus pandemic and urged for maximum inoculations among eligible age groups.“We have to move towards optimum utilisation of the country’s vaccination capacity. This is a way to augment our capacity,” he said in a blog post addressed to the citizens.Inoculating as many people as possible is one of the effective ways to counter the spread of Covid-19, according to health experts and the government. On Tuesday, the Centre approved fast-tracking of approvals to vaccines which have already been cleared for emergency use by major health bodies in other countries.This step will give a boost to the ongoing vaccination drive by bringing in more vaccines to the country. Currently, Covaxin and Covishield are being used at different CVCs and India's drugs regulator has also given a nod to Russia's Sputnik V for emergency use.PM Modi, in his interaction with chief ministers last week over Covid-19 situation, proposed a four-day 'Tika Utsav' to ensure maximum participants in the vaccination drive. At present, those above 45 years of age are eligible to get the anti-Covid shot.The countrywide vaccination drive was rolled out on January 16 with healthcare workers (HCWs) getting inoculated and the vaccination of frontline workers (FLWs) started on February 2.The next phase of Covid-19 vaccination commenced on March 1 for those over 60 years of age and for people aged 45 and above with specified co-morbid conditions.India launched vaccination for all people aged more than 45 years from April 1.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tika-utsav-ends-today-over-25-lakh-doses-administered-on-day-3-101618365167180.html
14-04-2021||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||Tuesday, April 13, may well mark an important milestone in India’s fight against the coronavirus disease.First, the country’s drugs regulator, Drugs Controller General of India, granted emergency use authorisation (EUA) to Sputnik V, the Covid-19 vaccine developed by Russia’s Gamaleya Institute, and which will be marketed in India by Dr Reddy’s Laboratories. This was expected, after the Subject Expert Committee of India’s Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation recommended the emergency use approval of the vaccine on Monday.Shortly after, the government announced that it has accepted a recommendation from the National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for Covid-19 (Negvac), to grant emergency use authorisation to vaccines that already have similar approvals from the US Food & Drug Administration, the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, the EU’s European Medicines Agency, Japan’s Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency, or those listed for emergency use by the World health Organization.Sputnik V was approved in a hurry, with Russian President Vladimir Putin himself announcing the world’s first “registered” vaccine, and adding that his daughter was among those inoculated. At the time, there wasn’t enough data (there was some) to justify the approval, and the vaccine was eyed with distrust, not just by regulators in western nations, but also anyone who believed in science and data. Subsequent studies showed that the vaccine was hugely (92%) effective – not surprising, because the Russians do have a history of making effective vaccines.Dr Reddy’s applied for an emergency approval in India on the basis of the final data, but India insisted on a bridging study. The insistence seemed strange (although it is understandable because it is good scientific practice), when seen in the context of the approval of the locally made Covaxin, which was granted an unprecedented and never-heard-of-before emergency use authorisation “in clinical trial mode” by India’s drugs regulator on January 3. There was no way that those approving Covaxin could have known about its efficacy because there was no data at the time – not even interim. Efficacy is the most important criterion for a vaccine’s approval; a safe vaccine, which provokes an immune reaction (the first two are the result of safety and immunogenicity tests), but which isn’t effective, will achieve nothing. That Covaxin eventually proved to be as effective (81%) as the interim data showed was providential – and, also, at a personal level, deeply satisfying because Bharat Biotech, its developer, is a company this writer put on a “companies to watch for” list in a magazine in the early 2000s, and it is always a good feeling to be vindicated. Much like Sputnik V, Covaxin got a bad rap only because its approval was rushed through. As HT has reported, Russia’s sovereign wealth fund, which is managing the commercial aspects of Sputnik V, has already struck deals to make almost 700-800 million doses locally (it has struck deals with five Indian firms), with some of these becoming available in second and third quarters of 2021-22. These companies do not have to separately apply for approval. In addition, there’s the 100 million doses Dr Reddy’s will import and market.The decision to grant EUA to vaccines approved elsewhere – in the interests of safety, the government has mandated that the first 100 recipients of these in India will be tracked for a week before a wider roll-out – will immediately benefit Johnson & Johnson (its vaccine is approved by FDA, EMA, and WHO), Moderna (FDA, MHRA, EMA, and WHO), and Pfizer-BioNTech (FDA, MHRA, EMA, JPMA and WHO), although the last two will still face significant logistical issues given the very low temperatures at which their vaccines have to be stored and transported. It may also benefit Novavax, which has applied for approval of its vaccine to FDA, MHRA, and EMA. Serum Institute of India has a manufacturing deal with Novavax; the firm will start making its version of it later this year, and hopes to launch it by September. The launch has been delayed by the US government’s decision to restrict the export of raw material.Last week, Reuters reported that Johnson & Johnson would begin a bridging trial for its single-shot vaccine in India (it has an efficacy of 66.3% overall, but like the Moderna, Pfizer, and AstraZeneca vaccines, it offers 100% protection against severe infection and death). That trial will now not be required; Johnson & Johnson already has a manufacturing partnership with Biological E Ltd, a Hyderabad company that plans to make 1 billion doses of Covid-19 vaccines (not all are J&J ones) by the end of next year.It’s still important for the government to work with Serum Institute of India and Bharat Biotech (the makers of the first two Covid-19 vaccines approved by India) on expanding their capacities – both sought aid last week – and it’s even more important for it to come up with a long-term vaccine strategy that covers everything from research to manufacturing to the government’s own sourcing requirements (and commitments) to pricing to post-vaccine tracking and monitoring. The first generation of Covid-19 vaccines was initially expected to give people protection from severe disease for a couple of years, but there is no data supporting this. A report last week in the New England Journal of Medicine, and a statement from Pfizer said that the Moderna and the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines were still effective after six months. But no one is, as yet, clear how long this protection will last. What is clear is the need for a vaccine plan: people may need to take a vaccine every few years, or, at the least, take booster shots that can protect them from variants of the Sars-CoV-2 virus.

14-04-2021||India||State Covid fatality rate lowest this month: Govt||Bengaluru Even as Karnataka recorded a 100% increase in the weekly number of deaths due to coronavirus disease (Covid-19) last week, government data suggests that the state’s Case Fatality Rate (CFR) this month was the lowest since the outbreak of the pandemic. CFR refers to the number of deaths reported per 100 cases. In April so far, Karnataka’s CFR is 0.45%. In comparison, in April 2020, the CFR in Karnataka was 4.09%. According to government data, between April 6 and April 12, as many as 284 patients died due to Covid-19 in the state, including 188 in Bengaluru. In comparison, between March 30 and April 5, the state reported 137 Covid-19 deaths, including 77 in Bengaluru.“There has been over a 100% increase in the number of deaths in the state over the last week and in Bengaluru, percentage (increase in Covid-19 deaths) is around 150%. What is even more worrying is that young people are also losing their lives. If you look at the number of deaths reported on April 11 (Sunday), there are 33-year-old and two 38-year-olds. This is a matter of concern,” a member of the state’s Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) on Covid-19, said on the condition of anonymity.He added that the matter was taken up with state health minister K Sudhakar during a review meeting on Sunday. A senior Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) official, meanwhile, pointed out that a large number of patients died soon after getting hospitalised. Out of the 54 deaths reported on Monday in the state, 27 were those who died within 24 hours of getting admitted to the hospital. “This means that most of the cases are coming to the hospital after their situation get worse. In most cases, by the time a patient reached the hospital, there is very little that doctors can do. We have informed the authorities about the same,” the BBMP official said.People need to get tested quickly and not wait for symptoms to become worse, said experts. “The government has opened several fever clinics across the city and across the state. People should make use of them. We have asked the employees there to check all parameters of patients coming for a check-up and admit those who require insensitive treatment,” Sudhakar told HT on Tuesday.He added that the government will focus on accelerating the vaccination drive in the state. “We have already launched awareness campaigns to get more people vaccinate themselves. At the same time, we are aware of the increasing cases in the state, and we have ensured that 50% of beds in hospitals are made available for Covid-19,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/state-covid-fatality-rate-lowest-this-month-govt-101618340862785.html
14-04-2021||India||VK Paul recommends chyawanprash, ayurveda; experts criticise remarks||A senior government official at the forefront of India’s Covid response recommended that people consult ayurveda practitioners if they have mild or asymptomatic Covid-19 and consume chyawanprash and kadha (a brew of herbs and spices) to improve their immunity, triggering criticism from doctors who said such ideas could encourage people to try untested therapies and wait too long to seek medical help.The comments were made on Tuesday by Niti Aayog member (health) Dr VK Paul at the government’s weekly briefing on Covid-19, when he appealed for people to adhere to appropriate practices in order to help contain what is at present the worst outbreak the country has witnessed so far. “If you get Covid-19, consult ayurveda practitioners for treatment if symptoms are mild or asymptomatic. Take what they give after proper consultation to fight the disease. It is a treatment modality in itself so this also needs to be adopted.”“To boost immunity to deal with this pandemic, there are guidelines from the government that include adopting ayurveda and Ayush (Ayurveda, Yoga & Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homoeopathy) products. Specific recommendations tell us to consume chyawanprash twice a day; have turmeric milk at least once in a day; it is extremely popular among masses we have found in our surveys; and a warm drink made from basil, cinnamon, and black pepper concoction should also be had, along with doing yoga to boost your immunity,” said Paul, who added that yoga also helps strengthen lung capacity for those suffering from long Covid.“These will help; in fact, these have helped... We request on behalf of the government, the health ministry to adopt these measures,” Paul added.Doctors criticised Paul’s remarks. “This obviously does not make any sense; they are fooling the nation. If you have Covid-19, take chyawanprash or drink kadha but not go to a hospital? Where do you think you will land up? If it will help boost immunity; what is the need to take the vaccine?” said Dr Rajan Sharma, ex-national president, Indian Medical Association.“After listening to this, many will be encouraged to sit at home, drinking kadha and haldi doodh, and by the time they reach hospital, it will be too late,” he said, while adding that ultimately, the deaths of such people are often blamed on treating doctors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/paul-recommends-chyawanprash-ayurveda-experts-criticise-remarks-101618340743478.html
14-04-2021||India||Few hospital beds, delay in test results key challenges for Bengaluru||Around this time last year, Bengaluru, like other cities, was under a lockdown and the Covid-19 caseload was under better control as against the sharp spike it is witnessing in the ongoing second wave of infections this year, officials and medical practitioners have said. Since March, the IT capital has registered a spurt in cases and in April, it noted a record-breaking surge thrice in around a week’s time. The sudden spike in cases has added to the pressure on the requirement of hospital beds in a city that accounts for almost 70% of the cases in Karnataka, making it difficult for authorities to find solutions amid the second wave of the pandemic. From around 6,813 infections in February, the Covid tally in the state capital rose to 31,886 in March, according to data released by Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP). What’s worse is that in just the first 12 days of April, Bengaluru recorded 50,636 cases indicating the rapid spread of the disease. Karnataka health commissioner K V Trilok Chandra, however, claimed that the government is better prepared to tackle the situation this time. “We are definitely better prepared than the last time,” he told HT.The city on Tuesday recorded 5,500 cases and 55 fatalitieswithin a span of 24 hours. According to the civic body, at present, there are around 3,750 beds in the city, of which over 70% are occupied. Additionally, there are 600 beds in Covid care centres (CCC) for asymptomatic persons who may not be able to isolate themselves well in their homes. “During its (Covid) peak last year (around September), we had around 11,000 beds and we are trying to have the same number this time around as well,” a senior BBMP official who did not wish to be named said. With the positivity rate going up to around 7% in Karnataka and Bengaluru, the numbers of people requiring hospitalisation has also increased, data released by the civic body showed. Data also showed that nearly 4,000 people have been shifted to hospitals and CCCs in the city while around 20 infected individuals are untraceable. The percentage of patients in hospitals and CCCs is as low as 8.72% in Bommanahalli zone and 15.26% in R R Nagar, indicating that an average 13% require some sort of medical assistance in the city. Dr Prasanna H M, president-elect of Private Hospitals & Nursing Homes Association (PHANA), said the government has sought 50% of the beds from all private medical institutions. He also said that at present, a significant portion of the beds were occupied in private hospitals due to admission of both Covid and non-Covid persons and that the beds will be made available as and when they turn empty. The doctor also pegged that there are around 6,000 to 7,000 beds in private hospitals and other institutions and that half of these would be made available to the government. The PHANA president-elect also said that private hospitals are working on setting up a toll-free number to provide information to persons requiring hospitalisation and prevent them from moving from place to place in search of beds. The unavailability of hospital beds and spike in mortality rate, experts said, are the two reasons why the state should observe a lockdown. Karnataka has resisted a shutdown on the grounds that the government has made better preparations compared to last year and to prevent any impact on the economy. The B S Yediyurappa-led government has refused to impose any lockdown-like measures but conceded to announcing a 10-day night curfew from April 10 to 20 in seven districts, including Bengaluru, after a meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on April 8. “We have conducted 2.2 crore Covid tests out of which 85% are RT-PCR, he said. People should cooperate in controlling the pandemic. We have not said that lock down will be imposed. But we are appealing to the public not to make lock down inevitable,” K Sudhakar, Karnataka’s health minister said on Monday. The district administration of Bengaluru aims to conduct around 100,000 tests per day to contain the surge. Besides this, the state government hopes that the ongoing vaccination drive across large apartment complexes and offices will reduce the number of persons requiring hospitalisation.However, increased testing has made it difficult for laboratories to collect samples from home, forcing people to physically visit medical facilities for the same. Besides, the sudden rush has made it difficult for authorities to provide results of Covid tests on time. According to officials, the average delivery of test results for RT-PCR now stood at around 48 hours in most places in the state capital. “Most of the districts are delivering within a day. There have been a few isolated instances where people have not provided their contact number correctly or were not reachable. Otherwise, in most places, the results are being delivered within a day,” Chandra clarified.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/few-hospital-beds-delay-in-test-results-key-challenges-for-bengaluru-101618340742334.html
14-04-2021||India||Mahakumbh: Uttarakhand braces for another Shahi Snan||Authorities in Haridwar said they were preparing for a massive surge of devotees for a “Shahi Snan” on Wednesday, which is likely to be one of the busiest days of the Mahakumbh, which has turned into major Covid outbreak concern as millions gather at the city’s ghats for a holy dip in the Ganga.The last such Shahi Snan on Monday was marked by widespread violation of Covid-appropriate behaviour with most people not wearing masks and bunching close together. The Kumbh administration expects a crowd of at least 2.5 million on Wednesday, and has claimed all required arrangements have been made.The Haridwar district police on Tuesday reported that it recorded only about 86,247 people who came with proper prior registration as required under Covid protocol, although the Mela administration said 3.1 million attended the event.“On Monday during the second Shahi Snan, about 31 lakh people took the holy bath at Ganga ghat amid all our arrangements in place. We are expecting a crowd of at least 25 lakh (2.5 million) on Wednesday for the third Shahi Snan which would be most significant day in the month long Mahakumbh,” said state director general of police Ashok Kumar.At least 184 people tested positive at the shahi snan on Monday.“During the shahi snan, the health staffers tested 30,685 people by taking random samples... during which 184 tested positive. We are taking the required action as per the Covid-19 protocol,” said Haridwar chief medical officer Dr SK Jha.On Tuesday, Uttarakhand recorded 1,925 new Covid-19 cases and 13 deaths, according to the HT dashboard. The state has, so far, recorded a total of 112,071 cases and 1,780 deaths.National vice president of Indian Medical Association (IMA) Dr DD Chowdhury, who had termed the congregation of three million people in Monday’s Shahi Snan as the “greatest disaster” for the country on curbing the pandemic, said: “In order to do that, the Mela administration should at least ensure that all are wearing masks.”Chief minister Tirath Singh Rawat on Tuesday said the government successfully organised a “safe and successful second shahi snan and will do same on Wednesday too”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mahakumbh-haridwar-braces-for-another-shahi-snan-101618340622249.html
14-04-2021||India||PM Modi’s meetings with dignitaries to be scaled down amid Covid spike||The government plans to scale down Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s meetings with visiting dignitaries in the wake of a surge in Covid-19 cases within the country and abroad, people familiar with developments said on Tuesday.This was cited as the reason for the cancellation of a meeting between the PM and visiting French foreign minister Jean-Yves Le Drian and his delegation on Tuesday, the people said on condition of anonymity.The development came close on the heels of foreign secretary Harsh Shringla’s periodic Covid-19 test producing an “inconclusive” result sometime after a meeting between the delegations led by external affairs minister S Jaishankar and Le Drian at Hyderabad House, the people said. Another test was conducted, and its outcome would be known by Wednesday, the people said.The foreign secretary has already received both doses of the vaccine and has tested negative in periodic tests conducted over the past few weeks, the people added. There was no word from the French side on whether there would be any change in Le Drian’s itinerary. The French minister participated in a meeting with adequate social distancing at the French embassy, and he is scheduled to travel to Bengaluru on Wednesday.There was also no word on whether the meeting between Le Drian and the prime minister would be re-scheduled.The spike in Covid-19 cases in several parts of the world has affected the travel schedules of ministers from several countries. More than a dozen foreign and defence ministers had been expected to participate in-person in this year’s Raisina Dialogue, the flagship event of the external affairs ministry, before it was recently declared a fully digital affair.Le Drian was one of the few ministers who went ahead with plans to visit India for the Dialogue and bilateral meetings.Australian foreign minister Marise Payne, who was to have participated in a trilateral meeting with Jaishankar and Le Drian on the margins of the Dialogue, called off her visit to New Delhi over the weekend as it would have entailed a lengthy quarantine on returning home.There is also no confirmation on whether Japanese foreign minister Yoshihide Suga will go ahead with a planned visit to India in late April or early May.The second wave of Covid-19 in India has crossed the previous highest surge and the upward trend of infections is a cause of concern, officials have said.The country recorded 185,287 new cases and 1,026 deaths on Tuesday according to the HT dashboard. It has so far seen 13,871,325 cases and 172,134 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/modis-meetings-with-dignitaries-to-be-scaled-down-amid-covid-spike-101618340504074.html
14-04-2021||India||Government calls for rational remdesivir application||There is no shortage of remdesivir, a key antiviral drug used to treat Covid-19 patients, Niti Aayog member Dr VK Paul said on Tuesday, even as he urged people to use the drug rationally.“There were reports of shortages in some states but overall there is no shortage of the drug. There are plenty of stocks available,” he added.“There is no question of using remdesvir in home settings for Covid-19 patients. The patient has to be on oxygen therapy, and the drug is supposed to be supplied only to hospitals and not to be sold in retail. I urge people for rational use of the drug. It is not meant for everyone,” said Paul, while addressing the Union health ministry’s weekly briefing on Covid-19.Remdesivir, an injection, continues to be used in India despite WHO recommending against its use, on the grounds that there is no evidence that it works.However, the drug continues to be on India’s National Clinical Management Protocol for Covid-19, and with active cases crossing a million, and hospitalisations soaring, many Indians have begun seeing the drug as a lifesaver, causing demand to spike. There is also believed to be black-marketing of the drug, several generic versions of which are being made in India, including one for less than ₹1,000.India has banned the export of remdesivir and its ingredients in an attempt to address the shortage — brought about, in part, by hoarding and indiscriminate use.Cipla, one of the local manufacturers of the drug said it was working with the regulatory authorities to restrict supply of the drug only to hospital channels, and especially those regions with high burden of severe Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-calls-for-rational-remdesivir-application-101618340383434.html

PM Modi is among those invited.“We actually entered into a partnership there, where we will assist, along with other nations, to help bring finance — and when I say finance, I’m not talking about taxpayer dollar, I’m talking about the private sector investing in this deployment — which will require some changes by India (in) certain parts of what it does,” Kerry said in an interview to CNN Tuesday when asked if he got any commitments from India during the visit.The investment will be “a huge amount”, he said, which “would allow India to keep track with 1.5 degrees centigrade limitation on the increase of the Earth’s temperature”.Kerry did not specify which countries are likely to join the US and India and what will be that “huge amount”. Crucially, he also did not specify the changes that India will be required to make in its mitigation efforts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/us-vows-to-help-bring-investment-to-assist-india-s-mitigation-efforts-101618339962173.html
14-04-2021||India||Apex court warns HCs over granting ‘blanket orders’ against arrests||The Supreme Court on Tuesday cautioned the high courts against granting “blanket orders” staying investigations or preventing arrests in criminal cases, underscoring such orders affect the right of the police to probe under the law.Laying down a set of 18 parameters, the bench, headed by justice Dhananjay Y Chandrachud, held that orders of “no coercive step” against accused, or staying arrests, could not be issued “routinely, casually or mechanically”, without specifying extraordinary reasons and circumstances that necessitated such orders.The bench, which included justices MR Shah and Sanjiv Khanna, regretted that despite some judgments by the top court in the past, it was regularly coming across many orders by the high courts staying arrests or directing ‘no coercive steps against the accused’ without assigning any reasons.“Granting of such blanket order would not only adversely affect the investigation but would have far-reaching implications for maintaining the Rule of Law. Where the investigation is stayed for a long time, even if the stay is ultimately vacated, the subsequent investigation may not be very fruitful for the simple reason that the evidence may no longer be available,” stated the judgment, authored by justice Shah.The bench laid down the guidelines while setting aside the September 2020 order of the Bombay high court, protecting a director of a real-estate development company and his business partners in a case of cheating and forgery against them. The accused had moved a writ petition before the high court, which passed the interim order of ‘no coercive measures’ in their favour while adjourning the matter to a future date.The complainant company, Neeharika Infrastructure Pvt Ltd, challenged the interim order in the top court. The bench said that such orders were “not justified at all”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/apex-court-warns-hcs-over-granting-blanket-orders-against-arrests-101618339903272.html
14-04-2021||India||Kashi Vishwanath-Gyanvapi mosque case: Sunni board moves HC over trial court order||The Uttar Pradesh Sunni Central Waqf Board (UPSCWB) on Tuesday approached the Allahabad high court seeking temporary suspension of a Varanasi local court verdict that ordered an archaeological survey of the Gyanvapi mosque to determine if it was built after demolishing a Hindu shrine.The move came a day after the management committee of the 17th-century mosque, which abuts the Kashi Vishwanath Temple, also filed an urgent petition in the high court against the Varanasi court order.The religious dispute – similar to the one in Ayodhya – is decades old and first reached the courts in 1991, when local Hindu priests sought permission to worship in the mosque area. In 1998 the matter reached the Allahabad HC, which on March 15 this year reserved its judgment on various pleas challenging the maintainability of the 1991 suit.But on April 8, a Varanasi local court asked the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) to conduct a “comprehensive physical survey” of the mosque premises. The order came on a separate petition filed on December 2019 by Vijay Shankar Rastogi, who demanded the mosque area be surveyed to prove Mughal rulers demolished a part of the temple and illegally built a mosque.UPSCWB argued that the Varanasi court order was illegal because proceedings on the same matter were pending before the Allahabad HC.“The urgent application is filed seeking a stay on the lower court proceedings during pendency of petition in high court on maintainability of 1991 suit, while a separate revision petition will be filed in district court challenging the order of archaeological survey of the Masjid complex,” said UPSCWB counsel Puneet Kumar Gupta. “Since justice Prakash Padiya of the Allahabad HC reserved the judgment on March 15, 2021, how can the lower court hear the matter and pass the order?” he asked.On Monday, the Anjuman Intezamia Masjid Committee, which runs the Gyanvapi mosque, filed an urgent petition before the high court , and said the trial court order was passed illegally and without jurisdiction.“The HC had reserved verdict on issue of maintainability of the suit. The court below should not have passed any order in the suit till the issue of maintainability of suit was decided by the high court,” said senior counsel SFA Naqvi, who appeared on behalf of the Masjid committee.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kashi-vishwanath-gyanvapi-mosque-case-sunni-board-moves-hc-over-trial-court-order-101618339842208.html
14-04-2021||India||Sputnik V vaccine gets DCGI nod for emergency use||The drugs controller general of India (DCGI), VG Somani, on Tuesday approved the Covid-19 vaccine developed by Russia’s Gamaleya Research Institute, Sputnik V, for emergency use in India, a day after the regulator’s subject expert committee (SEC) recommended that there was enough data to grant the vaccine emergency use authorisation.India is the 60th country to approve the vaccine.The vaccine will initially be imported and marketed by Dr Reddy’s Laboratories, a process that is expected to start within weeks. The first local supplies are expected by July. The imports, it is expected, will strengthen India’s supply pipeline.During the weekly Covid-19 briefing on Tuesday, Dr VK Paul, member (health), Niti Aayog, said the approval for Sputnik V was a significant step. “This vaccine approval has been a result of a collaborative effort between the two governments, and is a significant step,” he said.Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan said it was too early to comment on procurement, distribution and pricing. HT learns that Dr Reddy’s will start suppling imported Sputnik doses to the government by April-end.“We are looking at producing 50 million doses or more a month of Sputnik V by this summer, or end of summer, in India. India has a significant production capacity; we have already announced tie ups with five local companies for mass production of Sputnik V, and we intend to have several more tie-ups that will announce soon,” said Kirill Dmitriev, CEO, Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), Russia’s sovereign wealth fund that is marketing the vaccine globally.Dr Reddy’s, which is conducting clinical trials in India on behalf of the makers of Sputnik V and has the distribution right for the vaccine in India, released a statement on Tuesday stating that it has received the national regulator’s emergency use approval.“We are very pleased to obtain the emergency use authorisation for Sputnik V in India. With the rising cases in India, vaccination is the most effective tool in our battle against Covid-19. This will enable us to contribute to our nation’s effort of vaccinating a significant proportion of our population,” said GV Prasad, managing director and co-chairman, Dr Reddy’s.In September 2020, Dr Reddy’s partnered with RDIF to conduct the bridging trial of Sputnik V and distribute the vaccine in India. Sputnik V uses two different vectors for the two shots in a course of vaccination. The efficacy of Sputnik V was determined to be 91.6%, as per a published article in the Lancet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sputnik-v-vaccine-gets-dcgi-nod-for-emergency-use-101618339663524.html
14-04-2021||India||Medical infra stressed amid Covid surge||Prashant Kumar, a student of veterinary sciences in Ranchi, visited 10 hospitals in five hours on April 11 to find a bed for his 60-year-old uncle who is Covid-positive with severe symptoms. Unsuccessful, the 30-year-old finally took his uncle, a retired veterinary doctor, to Jamshedpur, around 125km away, where he was admitted to a private hospital. “My uncle’s condition was serious, so I booked an oxygen-supported ambulance. I started searching for a bed from 8.30pm. I visited several hospitals till 1.30am, but none could admit him,” Kumar said.Officials said all the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) beds in Ranchi’s two public-run hospitals are occupied, and only 24 are free in the 22 private Covid-designated hospitals. The district is also facing an acute shortage of oxygen-supported beds — only 89 of the 784 beds are free, while 73 out of the city’s 194 ventilators are available.Nearly 1,000 kilometres away, in Madhya Pradesh, Deepmala was unable to find a bed for her 48-year-old husband, an additional postmaster at a railway station in Chhindwara. Vikas Kumar began to feel breathless on Sunday, but couldn’t be admitted in Junardeo, the small town where they live. She rushed him to Bhopal, 273km away, only to be turned away by three private hospitals that cited 100% occupancy as the reason. Two days later, Kumar finally got admission in a government-run hospital. “For 48 hours, I went through trauma. My husband was feeling breathlessness and I was unable to help him,” Deepmala said.Across India, a surge in infections is driving huge numbers of patients to hospitals which is stretching the limits of health care infrastructure in several cities.Urban centres hitIf Maharashtra is driving India’s second wave, Pune, Mumbai, Thane and Nagpur are the four big urban centres driving Maharashtra’s daily caseload; in the first four days of April, they accounted for 59% of the state’s cases.In Pune district, where 10,019 new Covid cases were reported on Tuesday (driving the total up to 671,426 of which 118,168 are active cases), patients are being turned away due to bed shortage. Most major hospitals in Pune city have run out of ventilators and ICU beds; only 23 ICU beds with ventilators were free (out of 1,142 in the district), while 753 isolation beds with oxygen were free (out of 9,942). The demand for oxygen in the district has gone up by over 350% in the first four months of 2021 and, in all only 4,120 beds out of 23,156 were vacant on April 13 in Pune.The situation in Mumbai is only slightly better. As of April 13, as many as 15,451 beds were occupied out of the 19,329 Covid-19 beds under the BMC’s command (13,512 in public hospitals and 5,817 in private hospitals). The city has 89 ICU beds available (out of a total of 2,529) and 32 ventilators available (out of a total of 1,302).Thane and Nagpur fare no better, as patients are being discharged early to make space for other Covid-positive admissions. Sunil Madavi, 26, an attendant at a city cancer hospital, was admitted to the Government Medical College and Hospital (GMHC) in Nagpur last month but discharged within nine days. “After reaching home, he was disoriented, did not recognise family or friends and spoke incoherently. We got him admitted to a private hospital,” a colleague said.GMCH superintendent Dr Avinash Gawande said that the hospital had only 900 Covid-19 beds. “It’s really very difficult to accommodate everyone as hardly 18-20 patients get discharged as against 70-80 new admissions daily.”The situation in other cities is fast turning dire.A long queue of ambulances was seen on Monday night outside Ahmedabad’s Civil Hospital amid the deteriorating situation of COVID-19 in the state, news agency ANI reported. “Our occupancy right now is 90-95 per cent,” said JV Modi, Superintendent, Civil Hospital, adding that all patients were admitted.In Bengaluru, the case count shot up to 31,886 in March from around 6,813 daily infections in February. However, in just the first 12 days of April, Bengaluru has registered 50,636 cases (till Monday), indicating the rapid spread of the disease in India’s IT capital.There are currently around 3,750 beds in the city, of which over 70% are already occupied, officials said, adding to the pressure on existing infrastructure. Dr Prasanna HM of the Private Hospitals & Nursing Homes Association, Bengaluru said that the government has sought 50% of the bed strength from all private medical institutions.In Chandigarh, nearly half the 500 beds reserved for Covid patients is occupied, and in poll-bound Kolkata, nine out of the 45 private Covid hospitals are full, and taking no more admissions. Another 17 designated Covid hospitals have less than 10 beds left in them. In the state-run ID&BG Hospital, the nodal hospital for Covid-related cases, which has 14 ICU beds and 17 High Dependency Unit (HDU) beds reserved for Covid patients, there are no vacancies.“In Kolkata beds are fast running out and the occupancy rate is around 75% - 80%. We are augmenting our infrastructure,” a health department official said.In Bhopal, all 200 ventilators were in use as of Tuesday. Of the 1,202 ICU beds, 921 were occupied.In Thiruvananthapuram, district medical officer K S Shinu said that of the 141 ICU beds earmarked for Covid patients in government hospitals and first line treatment centres in the city, 55 were vacant. Among private hospitals, 494 of the 795 ICU beds were vacant.As many as 83 out of 112 beds were occupied at the Patna Medical College Hospital, on Tuesday. At AIIMS, 106 of the 115 beds were occupied, while only 12 of the 100 beds at the Nalanda Medical College Hospital were available.“I feel helpless when I have to refuse patients because of unavailability of beds. Yesterday, one patient brought to our facility died because we could not provide ICU bed as all 26 are occupied. We have a waitlist, which has now shot up to 18 as on Tuesday. We are admitting Covid-19 patients through the waitlist,” said Dr Satyajit Singh, director, Ruban hospital, an NABH-accredited hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/medical-infra-stressed-amid-covid-surge-101618339602373.html
14-04-2021||India||Pandemic may reshape world order, says PM Modi||The Covid-19 pandemic is an opportunity to reshape the world order and put in place systems that can tackle the problems of today and challenges of tomorrow through an inclusive approach, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Tuesday.Noting that India has supplied vaccines to more than 80 countries despite many constraints, Modi said while addressing the inaugural session of the Raisina Dialogue that the country will continue to share its expertise and resources with the whole of humanity to fight the pandemic.The Raisina Dialogue is the external affairs ministry’s flagship conference on geopolitics and geoeconomics that is being held this year as a fully digital event because of a spike in Covid-19 cases around the world. More than a dozen foreign and defence ministers were earlier expected to attend the event in person.“The Covid-19 pandemic has presented us an opportunity to reshape the world order, to reorient our thinking. We must create systems that address the problems of today and challenges of tomorrow,” Modi said.“And we must think of the entire humanity and not merely of those who are on our side of the borders. Humanity as a whole must be at the centre of our thinking and action,” he added.Since the Covid-19 outbreak, the Indian government has pushed for reforms in global institutions such as the United Nations and the WHO, saying their outdated methods of working leave them unable to cope with current challenges.Modi said the horrors of the first and second World Wars “compelled the emergence of a new world order” and the creation of structures and institutions that were focused on only one issue – preventing a third World War. He suggested this was the wrong issue to focus on and the measures taken were akin to “treating a patient’s symptoms without addressing the underlying causes”. He said: “In fact, while humanity has not faced the third World War, the threat of violence has not reduced...With a number of proxy wars and unending terror attacks, the prospect of violence is ever present.”The world community would have been better served, Modi said, if all countries had focused on issues such as the causes of famine and hunger and poverty, and the lack of cooperation to address problems that threaten the entire humanity. “I’m sure that if our thinking has been along such lines, very different solutions would have emerged.”Modi also suggested that countries around the world were still trying to control the pandemic because the concern for welfare of humanity was left behind in the race for economic development, and the spirit of cooperation was forgotten in an age of competition.He called on the participants of the Raisina Dialogue this year to forge a human-centric approach. He noted that people are used to having a “Plan A and Plan B”, but “there is no Planet B, only planet Earth”.Against the backdrop of a domestic debate on whether India should continue vaccine exports at a time when the need of doses for the national immunisation programme is growing, Modi said India will continue sharing its resources with the world. “During this pandemic, in our own humble way, within our own limited resources, we in India have tried to walk the talk. We have tried to protect our own 1.3 billion citizens from the pandemic. At the same time, we have also tried to support the pandemic response efforts of others,” he said. India encouraged a coordinated response to the crisis in its neighbourhood, and it shared medicines and protective equipment with more than 150 countries. “We understand fully that humankind will not defeat the pandemic unless all of us, everywhere, regardless of the colour of our passports, come out of it. That is why, this year despite many constraints, we have supplied vaccine to over 80 countries,” Modi said.“We know that the supplies have been modest. We know that the demands are huge. We know that it will be a long time before the entire humanity can be vaccinated. At the same time, we also know that hope matters,” he said. “It matters as much to the citizens of the richest countries as it does to the less fortunate. And so we will continue to share our experiences, our expertise and also our resources with the entire humanity in the fight against the pandemic,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-pandemic-an-opportunity-to-reshape-world-order-pm-modi-101618332582464.html
14-04-2021||India||A tale of two visits and a shift in Indian foreign policy||Diplomatic visits, more often than not, are routine, more a function of bureaucratic necessities than of any real strategic significance. Most visits of foreign dignitaries to India or elsewhere hardly transform the underlying dynamic of the bilateral relationship. But sometimes, the tone and tenor of the engagement manages to convey more than either side perhaps intends to, thereby hinting at a fundamental transformation.Last week India hosted two important visitors – Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov, and the United States (US) special presidential envoy for climate John Kerry. They did not come to sign any major documents or make dramatic declarations. These were routine visits, one to lay the groundwork for a potential Russian presidential visit to India and the other to assess Indian intentions on climate. But these short visits revealed much more about the state of play in India-Russia and India-US ties than any formal policy document.While Lavrov asserted that India and Russia “are tied through a strategic partnership and at the heart of our partnership is the long-lived friendship between our nations and proximity of our stance on relevant international issues and our friendship,” it was evident that the partnership is drifting away from its strategic orientation.Differences have mounted, as the prism of the two nations to view the changing world order are substantively different. For a partnership that claims to be historical, Russia’s decision to speak on behalf of China on matters from the Indo-Pacific to the Quad underscores for India a sad reality of a partner that is in terminal decline requiring the crutches of China to showcase its viability as a global power. While, in the past, Lavrov had commented on how Indian foreign policy decisions are being shaped by other powers, this visit saw him attempting to shore up Pakistan as the central pillar of Russian South Asia policy. From trying to ensure that New Delhi is kept out of the Afghan peace process to reportedly offering a blank cheque to Pakistan, Russian foreign policy has indeed come a long way.Kerry, on the other hand, was in India to engage the country’s leadership on increasing climate ambition ahead of Joe Biden’s Leaders’ Summit on Climate to be held later this month and the COP26 meet scheduled for later this year. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is part of the 40 world leaders Biden has invited to a virtual summit on climate, aimed at underlining the urgency and the economic benefits of stronger climate action.Soon after taking office, Biden led the US back into the Paris climate accord. India’s role is critical in ensuring that global targets are achieved. From being on the opposite sides of the ideological divide, the two democracies are now working more closely than ever on climate action — notwithstanding differences on issues such as a timeline for net zero emission goal.Also Read | India-Russia relations not influenced by ties with other countries: MEAThese two visits firmly underscore the new operational realities of Indian foreign policy. There is no denying the fact that in an ideal world India would like to have excellent ties with both Russia and the US. In fact, for New Delhi, there is much to be gained by strengthening its ties with Moscow, something that Indian diplomacy has been trying hard to do over the last few years.Finding new areas of cooperation, moving the relationship away from its unidimensional nature of excessive dependence on defence ties, boosting energy and trade ties, keeping high levels of communication open — all of this has been done. Yet, the relationship has failed to improve significantly. In an ideal world, Russia would have great ties with the West and it would be engaged in the Indo-Pacific, giving the region greater heft vis-à-vis China. But that’s what India would like to see happen, not Russia.For Russia, its primary preoccupation is its growing rivalry with the West and if China helps it in pushing back against the West, then it is all for the best. Sentimentality in foreign policy is the worst possible response. While it is true that India needs Russia for its defence needs and for managing various regional issues, foreign policy is not a one-way street. India cannot keep on hoping for outcomes that Russia is not willing to deliver.Also Read | India, US to work closely on clean energy: US envoy John KerryAs the recent episode of the US 7th Fleet asserting navigational rights inside India’s EEZ without requesting India’s prior consent underlined, New Delhi and Washington too continue to have differences on a range of issues. From trade and human rights to defence purchases from Russia, challenges are significant and, sometimes, not prone to an easy resolution.But what is different is that the India-US relationship is New Delhi’s strategic partnership of this century, where the two partners have a similar frame of reference to map out their strategic challenges and so are willing to work together to manage differences. Something that was true of the Indo-Soviet partnership in the 20th century.It’s a different world out there today and there is no use complaining about change. Nations nimble enough to adapt rapidly are often the ones which emerge as the leaders.Harsh V Pant is professor, King’s College, London, and director of studies, Observer Research Foundation, New DelhiThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/a-tale-of-two-visits-and-a-shift-in-indian-foreign-policy-101618316261806.html
14-04-2021||India||HT insight: Decoding India’s second wave and vaccine strategy||India reported 63,689 Covid-19 cases on Tuesday, taking the tally of active cases to 1,264,698 as infections continued to surge months after the country was thought to have brought the situation under control. With record cases reported almost daily, the second wave of Covid-19 is surging at a much faster rate than the first. At least 60,000 daily cases have been reported since April 8.Hindustan Times has been covering the pandemic and its escalation through a series of reportage, data, commentary, and analysis-driven pieces. As the numbers surge, here are some of the pieces covering myriad aspects of the pandemic:What is driving India’s second Covid-19 wave? Why did this happen now? Why did the numbers escalate beyond what India had at its peak the first time? And what’s the way out? Gagandeep Kang, professor, Christian Medical College, Vellore, discusses how the lack of appropriate behaviour that could prevent the virus’ spread has increased, and potentially been amplified, because of viruses that are more transmissible than the ancestral version of the virus that we had last year.The future is here The patterns have been predictable for a while. In any susceptible population that is not making strong efforts to reduce transmission,  Sars-CoV-2 will rapidly transmit with exponential growth until a combination of recovered people with immunity and heightened precautions slow the spread, says director, Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (CSIR) Anurag Agrawal.How India can overcome the Covid-19 surge While India has to successfully battle the second wave, it is important not to create panic, but to stay calm. The surge will settle soon—but for that, a mix of scientific, administrative and behavioural changes  are essential. According to the honorary emeritus scientist of ICMR and former Dean of AIIMS, New Delhi, Narinder Kumar Mehra, it is important to identify reasons associated with the unprecedented rise in numbers and examine measures that must be taken to halt the upsurge.Five questions about vaccination Facile comments about making the Covid-19 vaccine available to those who need it, rather than those who want it, hide the fact that India’s vaccine strategy needs an urgent reboot, one that requires honest answers to five questions. Last week, in an editorial, HT asked five questions—Is India staring at a vaccine supply crunch? Why, if there was going to be an imminent supply crunch, did the government engage in vaccine diplomacy? Why are other vaccines not being approved? Is an age-based criterion the best way to determine priority for vaccination? How serious is India’s political leadership about the Covid-safety protocol?India’s vaccine strategy is based on science In less than three months, we have managed to provide more than 100 million doses across the country, which is more than the population of Germany. The country has already achieved one of the highest daily vaccinations per day across the globe with 4.3 million vaccinations, which is close to the population of New Zealand. India has also achieved the fastest rate of reaching the 100 million vaccination milestone, ahead of the US and China. Our daily vaccination rates are also among the highest in the world, says Vijay Chauthaiwale, in-charge, foreign affairs department, BJP, and a senior scientist, in a response to the HT editorial.As vaccination drive picks up pace, challenges remain As India crossed the milestone of 100 million doses on Saturday, data indicated that it would take some doing to maintain a pace that could help India turn the tide against the surging second wave of infections. The case trajectory of the second wave has long surpassed the first wave peak both nationally and in at least six states, according to HT’s dashboard. However, the best news for India right now is that the country-wide pace of administering doses is the fastest it has ever been recorded—Jamie Mullick analyses.Exclude Maharashtra, and India’s second Covid wave is still frightening The outbreak in the western state, which is by a far margin the worst-hit in the country, has (rightfully) dominated headlines over the past month-and-a-half. But is the outbreak in Maharashtra magnifying the severity of India’s second wave? Do India’s current Covid numbers look better if we remove Maharashtra’s numbers from the national tally? The answer to both is: not really. Indeed, the magnitude of the outbreak in Maharashtra may have actually masked the march of the viral disease in other states—Jamie Mullick looks at the figures.How bad is the current wave of Covid in India? The story of India’s Covid-19 battle has changed (for the worse) in the past month. For almost eight months after September, when India’s first wave peaked, the country saw a steady decline in daily cases and deaths -- but a second wave that started mid-February is now undoing months of progress made against the outbreak. How bad is the second wave? Are things as bad as fast as they were during the rise of the first wave? As India races to vaccinate enough people amid fears of mutant strains of the virus, here’s a quick look at how the second wave of infections is playing out—Jamie Mullick writes.UK, California, Manaus: What they suggest about the Covid crisis in Maharashtra The deviation in Maharashtra’s trajectory (and to some extend Punjab’s) resembles examples from three other regions where mutations have in fact been implicated: United Kingdom (UK)’s London and south-east, Brazil’s Manaus, and California in the United States (US). All three are believed to be the ground zero for variants that make the coronavirus spread more readily or cheat immunity from a previous infection (or both)—Binayak Dasgupta analyses.In Maharashtra, mutation raises infectivity concerns One of the two mutations feared to have spread rapidly in Maharashtra may have the ability to make the Sars-Cov-2 more adept at infecting humans, improve its ability to multiply within a host, and possibly escape a more complex part of the human immune response, a new study awaiting peer review suggests. The findings relate to the mutation known as L452R, which is one of the two “double mutations” the Indian government said was detected in large numbers in parts of Maharashtra. The state is by far the worst-hit region in India, with an exponential rise in infections that has forced authorities to bring back lockdown-like curbs, writes Binayak Dasgupta.One year of Covid-19: How India fought the virus There are several ways to look at India’s Covid-19 year. On the face of it, it’s the story of a country battered by the world’s second-highest number of infections. But it is also a story of intrigue and, often, surprise. It has one of the lowest deaths rates seen in any large country and, leaving out trends that have become visible only in the latest fortnight, gone through only a single, gigantic wave of infections that appeared to be well-controlled by the country’s precarious health infrastructure. Binayak Dasgupta and Anonna Dutt analyse.Covid-19: What you need to know today In the seven days to Sunday night, India added an average of 133,918 coronavirus disease cases a day. India has overtaken Brazil to the second spot in terms of overall cases (since the start of the pandemic) and is surging ahead. It is also the country that’s adding the most cases a day right now. The current weekly average national positivity rate (based on Sunday’s number) is 9.9% and rising—far higher than the 5% (and declining) level which indicates that things are getting better.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ht-insight-decoding-india-s-second-wave-and-vaccine-strategy-101618313921701.html
14-04-2021||India||Equitable access to vaccines critical: S Jaishankar||Equitable distribution of Covid-19 vaccines can be achieved only with the creation of additional manufacturing capabilities in countries such as India, external affairs minister S Jaishankar said on Tuesday.Participating in a session at the Raisina Dialogue that focused on vaccines and global expectations, Jaishankar held up India’s ability to manufacture a range of Covid-19 vaccines as an example of global cooperation and said this couldn’t be seen as a “one-way street”.“Equitable access [to vaccines] is critically important in this [fight against the pandemic], because we all know that no one will be safe till everyone is safe,” he said during the virtual session moderated by Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation CEO Mark Suzman.There is a need for additional production capabilities for vaccines, and without it, “distributive justice by itself will not be adequate”, he added.Jaishankar said he could understand a country’s decision to focus on protecting its own people when it comes under stress because of rising infections and noted that the number of Covid-19 cases in India is going up too and the government chose to deal with the immediate challenge. “To the extent that you have margins and the ability and the obligation to help others, I think it’s the decent thing to do. Doing good is also doing smart,” he said.Noting that India’s ability to make vaccines is a result of international cooperation, he added: “International cooperation is not a one-way street where we are giving things to other people and somewhere short-changing ourselves.”Jaishankar’s comments came against the backdrop of the Indian government’s decision to exercise greater control over vaccine exports following a sudden spike in Covid-19 infections.The country recorded 185,287 new cases and 1,026 deaths on Tuesday according to the HT dashboard. It has so far seen 13,871,325 cases and 172,134 deaths.So far, India has provided 65.1 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines to 90 countries, including 10.6 million doses supplied as grants. India’s deliveries of vaccines to other countries followed on from its work in providing humanitarian aid to numerous countries after natural disasters and its actions to address climate crisis, Jaishankar said.The Indian government’s partnership with the Gates Foundation is a “global fairness coalition” aimed at ensuring that weaker and vulnerable people in some countries don’t get left behind, he said. The work done by Indian vaccine manufacturer with the WHO-backed COVAX facility is ensuring that African and Caribbean countries which don’t have wherewithal to access the market get timely assistance, he added.Part of India’s rise would be to demonstrate that its additional capabilities are in the “hands of a country which embraces the world”, said Jaishankar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/raisina-dialogue-jaishankar-roots-for-more-vaccine-production-facilities-in-india-101618311401500.html
14-04-2021||India||Approval for jabs cleared in other countries fast-tracked||Coronavirus vaccines cleared for use in the US, the UK, the European Union, and Japan will get fast-track approval in India, the Union government said on Tuesday, potentially boosting the country’s pandemic response through possible imports of Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson (J&J) products.Coming at a time when India records the world’s biggest surge in infections, the decision removes a significant barrier for vaccine makers, although questions remain on whether these firms will bring their products, if they have the capacity to, if they will tie up with Indian companies, and how soon these shots will be available.“Vaccines made outside of India, if approved by authorities in the US, UK, European Union, Japan, or under the WHO’s emergency use listing, are approved for use in India. The condition of clinical trials won’t apply, they can continue trials after approval,” said VK Paul, member (Health) Niti Aayog.“We hope, and we invite vaccines makers such as Pfizer, Moderna and J&J or any other vaccines that get approvals from these authorities to bring their products to India,” he added at a government briefing.Paul later told HT that as per emergency-use licensing norms, the distribution and procurement process will remain under government control as it is at present. “It is not a regular marketing licensure, it is EUA and all vaccines are governed by EUA laws where government controls procurement and distribution to ensure those who need the vaccine get it on priority. All countries are procuring and distributing Covid-19 vaccines under EUA currently,” he said, adding that since it will be under EUA, the government will monitor side-effects.Private hospitals and clinics are allowed to administer the vaccines but the process is monitored by the government, which uses the Co-WIN platform to track the factory-to-injection process.Paul said the move was meant to encourage these companies to use India’s pharma companies for production and “fill and finish” deals, and said that while there was no discussion yet on pricing, improved supplies in the long run will help bring prices down.Experts welcomed the government’s decision but said it remains to be seen whether the current procurement and distribution model will need to be tweaked, and if continuing with it will yield any gains.“If there are more vaccines available in market, people will have a choice and there will be healthy competition. How they get it in market will either be by importing these vaccines, or by these companies going in for a joint venture locally, which seems unlikely. It should not be the responsibility of the government to give these vaccines free; they may put a price tag to it but people should have a choice. At this point we don’t know how they will go about it,” said Dr SK Sarin, director, Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences.Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan, at the ministry briefing, described the step as a “significant streamlining and fast-tracking of the regulatory system” which now “opens doors for import of bulk or finished vaccines or import leading to fill and finish”.In a statement issued earlier in the day, the Union health ministry said the step was recommended by the National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for Covid-19 (NEGVAC) after a meeting on April 11.The accelerated approval will apply to doses authorised by US’s food and drug administration (FDA), UK’s Medicines and Health care products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), European Medicines Agency (EMA), Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA) Japan, or by the World Health Organization.Instead of requiring them to conduct a “bridging trial” prior to seeking approval, the government will allow them to roll out these coronavirus vaccines and conduct “parallel bridging clinical trial” after they get the authorisation. “Further, the first 100 beneficiaries of such foreign vaccines shall be assessed for seven days for safety outcomes before it is rolled out for further immunisation programme within the country,” the statement said.At present, there are vaccines by three companies that are approved by regulators identified by the government and are yet to be authorised in India: Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and J&J. A fourth vaccine, made by Novavax, has made progress in clinical trials and sought approval from several of these regulators.Among these, two companies already have tied up with Indian companies for production — Novavax and J&J. Novavax has licensed Serum Institute of India (SII) to produce a billion doses and the Pune-based company is also carrying out bridging trials in the country. Similarly, Hyderabad’s Biological E has a deal to produce 600 million doses of the J&J vaccine and was recently poised to begin bridging studies.The Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines were among the first to be approved anywhere in the world last year. Both have an efficacy rate of over 95% and use mRNA technology, which has emerged as a breakthrough platform for coronavirus vaccines.India, the world’s biggest maker of vaccines, has so far administered a little over 108 million doses of Covishield and Covaxin – the first two shots to be approved in the country. A third, Sputnik V made by Russia’s Gamaleya Institute, was approved formally on Tuesday and doses are expected to be imported at first before a group of five Indian companies that have contracts to begin churning out doses. Dr Reddy’s has the rights for distribution of the first 100 million doses in India, which will be a combination of Indian and Russian made vaccines, the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) said on Tuesday.“We appreciate the decision of India’s regulatory bodies to grant authorisation for Sputnik V. Approval of the vaccine is a major milestone as Russia and India have been developing an extensive cooperation on clinical trials of Sputnik V in India and its local production,” said RDIF CEO Kirill Dmitriev. Since March, the developers have stitched up more agreements to ramp up the production of the vaccine in India.Though India was the fastest among all countries to vaccine 100 million people, concerns have been mounting in some states about whether there are adequate supplies. According to production capacities declared by SII (which makes Covishield – the Indian version of the Oxford-AstraZeneca dose) and Bharat Biotech, the average production capacity at present comes to about 2.5 million doses a day.Over the past week, India has administered 4.1 million doses a day on average.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-to-fast-track-emergency-use-approval-for-foreign-produced-covid-vaccines-101618302160979.html
14-04-2021||India||On the election trail, the politics of the wild||It is not very common for wildlife to feature in the heat of political campaigns and, yet, the Greater One Horned Rhino or the Indian Rhinoceros as it is also called was recently invoked in a campaign speech in Assam by no less than the Prime Minister.Speaking at an election rally in Bokakhat not too far away from the Kaziranga National Park on March 21, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, among other things, said that the Bharatiya Janata Party-led state government in Assam has ensured that those involved in rhino poaching are behind bars and accused the Opposition of being soft on poachers, when the latter was in power in the state.Irrespective of the political hue of those in power, the story of rhino conservation in Assam is one of resounding success. From an estimated 12 individuals in 1908, numbers have grown close to 3,000 in the Kaziranga National Park presently. Undoubtedly, political commitment backed by the provision of required resources is key to the success of any public cause, including that of wildlife conservation.Also Read | 1 more Cong ally moves candidates out of Assam over poaching fearsIt was another Prime Minister’s actions that laid the foundation for many of the country’s greatest conservation successes. Project Tiger was launched in 1973 during the tenure of the then Prime Minister, Indira Gandhi. Over 900 Protected Areas in India extending over a diverse range of habitats and ecosystems and covering 165,000 sq. km. (approx. 5% of the country’s total geographic area) owe their continued existence to the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972 also passed during her tenure.That era was different and current political leaders may find it much more difficult to balance the demands of competing constituencies when it comes to the conservation of wildlife and their habitat. A case in point being a recent submission made by the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), subsequently withdrawn, to the Karnataka high court that the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, which was passed by the Indian Parliament “not only for the protection of the environment but also at the instance of foreign powers”.Fortunately, calls for increased protection of the Indian Rhinoceros find great resonance with the people of Assam, most of whom see the rhino as a symbolic representation of themselves, an essence of what it means to be Assamese. Poll rhetoric that seeks to suggest that a section of the populace may be “outsiders”, and, by extension, against the rhino or worse still are poachers or support poaching, is unfortunate.Elephants too have featured as a poll issue in the keenly contested assembly elections in West Bengal. News reports speak of harassed residents of villages spread over 12 assembly seats in Bankura district in south Bengal seeking a permanent solution to the problems caused by the pachyderms. Six months ago, the state government announced an increase in the ex-gratia payment to the kin of those deceased in an elephant attack from ₹250,000 to ₹400,000 and a job for a member of the family in the Home Guard.While welcome, such measures fall short as the underlying causes of human-elephant conflict remains unaddressed. The elephants in Bankura too could be labelled “outsiders”, having come into Bengal from Dalma in Jharkhand nearly 35 years ago. While some animals spend up to six months in Bengal before returning to Jharkhand, many have chosen to stay on, feeding on crops while sheltering in the plantation forests.Experts list several reasons for this movement including drought, loss of habitat and disruption of migratory routes within existing home ranges (around 1000 sq. km. for female led herds) due to linear infrastructure projects, large scale mining and urban expansion.Also Read | Amid surge in Covid-19 cases, Assam issues guidelines to celebrate Rongali BihuDisplaced elephants have not just been migrating from Jharkhand to Bengal but also from Odisha and Jharkhand further west to Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh. In the Lok Sabha elections of 2019, many villagers in Chhattisgarh’s Surguja constituency chose not to vote to express their anger and dismay at the lack of action on the part of state authorities to address the conflict effectively.Wildlife then, it would appear, features in poll campaigns as an emotive issue where a threat to the species as is the case with the Indian Rhinoceros, seen as emblematic of Assamese identity, can be (and is) projected as a threat to the indigenous culture. Wildlife or issues related to wildlife also seem to matter at the hustings when political suitors are compelled to respond to the voters’ distress and anger such as in Bankura.For real conservation gains to be made and for far-reaching and permanent solutions for hundreds of communities across the country that suffer losses due to human-wildlife conflict, our politicians need to display a maturity that goes beyond deploying wildlife as just another stratagem to score over opponents during election times. Issues of wildlife conservation need to be embedded within a larger framework and narrative to secure India’s ecological security. India’s political class has displayed such foresight in the past and will need to do so now more than ever.Yash Shethia is Director, Wildlife Landscape and Wildlife & Habitats Programme, WWF IndiaThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/on-the-election-trail-the-politics-of-the-wild-101618298200766.html

14-04-2021||India||The Number Theory: Where is the second Covid-19 wave bigger than the first?||With new cases hitting a fresh high almost every day, India is currently climbing the second wave of Covid-19 infections at a much faster rate than the first. The second wave is also much taller than the first wave at the nationwide level. The seven-day average of new cases was 133,918 on April 11. This is 1.4 times the weekly average of 93,617 India hit on September 16 last year at the peak of the first wave. Is the second wave larger than the first everywhere? Are the states testing enough?Second wave bigger than first in nine states/UTsBy April 11, the second wave was bigger than the first in eight states – Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Rajasthan, and Haryana – and the Union territory of Chandigarh. In the first four states, the current seven-day-average of cases is 1.8 to 3.2 times their peak seven-day averages. This is 1.4 times for India as a whole. The current rising wave of cases in Jharkhand, Delhi, Goa and Telangana (especially the first two) means that these too might soon overtake their previous peaks. In these states, the current average is 80% of their earlier peaks.Low testing hiding the true scale of the second waveThe weekly average of positivity rate of Covid-19 testing in India reached an all-time low of 1.47% on February 13. It has climbed steeply since. The average was 10.7% on April 11. It has been higher than this only on 13 days prior to April 11: from July 19 to July 29, and on August 2 and August 3, when testing was yet to reach its fullest capacity in the country. The World Health Organization (WHO) considers a positivity rate of 5% to be the threshold for considering the Covid-19 epidemic as under control. One of the reasons for this is that a low positivity rate of tests implies that most infected people have been identified and isolated, and cannot spread the infection further. India’s high positivity rate of tests underlines the severity of the second wave in India. It also suggests that there might be several more Covid-19 cases that have not been identified.Eighteen states/UTs that need to ramp up testingThe scale of the second wave compared to the first is not a sufficient metric to measure how bad the current surge is; for that, positivity rates need also be considered. At the state level, for instance, of the nine states and UTs where the second wave has overtaken the first one, only Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh registered an average positivity rate lower than 5% in the week ending April 11. Of the remaining 25 states and UTs for which testing numbers are available (numbers not available only for Ladakh, Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu), almost half (11 states/UTs) have a positivity rate greater than 5%. Clearly, these 11 regions also cannot be complacent just because their second wave is so far smaller than the first one – they need to increase testing.In six of the nine states/UTs with a second wave bigger than the first (the exclusions are Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, and Haryana), the average number of tests in the week ending April 11 was the highest ever, suggesting that there has been an effort to increase testing. Among the 11 states, where the current average of cases is still lower than their previous peak, only Delhi has increased testing (to its highest level).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/the-number-theory-where-is-the-second-covid-19-wave-bigger-than-the-first-101618246805157.html
14-04-2021||Today's||On climate and green transition, the areas of India-EU convergence||What is a fair contribution to the global fight against the climate crisis? It is a question at the heart of discussions in both the European Union (EU) and India. We know that at the Glasgow summit in November this year, our individual efforts will again be added up and tested against the limits of what our planet can endure. The health and well-being of our people are on the line.The climate and biodiversity crises are global crises. They require solutions that carry the support of all, and provide support to all. The Paris Agreement commits us to following the best available science and achieving net-zero emissions in the second half of this century. But it also calls on us to do so on the basis of equity, in the context of sustainable development and efforts to eradicate poverty.In recent years, the world has watched India’s rise, growing its economy at rates we can only admire. India’s efforts to decouple growth from a dependence on fossil fuels have the potential to make economic development more sustainable and supply the rural poor with clean, affordable and reliable energy.On track to overachieve the Paris targets it set for itself in 2015, India is demonstrating how efforts to cut emissions and increase prosperity can reinforce each other — for reduced reliance on coal, investments in mass transportation, and emissions standards can strongly improve the quality of urban life and public health. And that is needed, because air pollution is detrimental to our health, and, as estimated by the World Health Organization, accounts for up to 4.2 million premature deaths worldwide per year.EU also faces the urgent challenge of greening and growing our economy, and promoting a just transition that leaves no one behind. It is with these objectives in mind that EU has committed to achieve a net-zero emission economy by 2050, and we have enhanced our Paris target from a 40% emissions reduction by 2030 to at least 55%.Even though our starting points differ, I believe there is more that unites than divides us. Still dependent on the import of polluting fossil fuels, we need to find ways to decarbonise without de-industrialising. We are both developing strategies to speed up the introduction of green hydrogen, working together through international partnerships such as Mission Innovation, and the International Solar Alliance. Through the Leadership Group for Industry Transition, we are collaborating on exploring how heavy industries that connect our economies can produce steel and other goods without producing greenhouse gas emissions.As close partners in trade and investment, we now must work to accelerate investment in zero-carbon tech and align our finance more closely with achieving the Paris goals, from government procurement to private sector investments, to export credits and development assistance. More immediately, we need to ensure that the additional stimulus we will inject into our economies spurs a green recovery from the Covid crisis. Our cooperation through the International Platform for Sustainable Finance enables us to share ideas on how to help investors identify green investments. Finally, it is clear that our societies are feeling the effects of the climate crisis. While we work to cut emissions, we need to prepare for the unavoidable and keep building the resilience of our societies, and, in particular, the most vulnerable. As part of EU’s adaptation strategy, we are scaling up our commitment to support communities both at home and around the world, and are pleased to have joined the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure launched by India.India and EU must face these shared challenges in partnership. We both share a belief that strong government goals can drive innovation in our economies and contribute to reaching the Paris Agreement’s goals. Our economies depend on each other through deeply connected supply chains and investment flows. Our fates are intertwined and we are bound to the same planetary limits.Frans Timmermans is executive vice-president, European Commission for the European Green Deal and European Commissioner for Climate Action The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/on-climate-and-green-transition-the-areas-of-india-eu-convergence-101618407232076.html
14-04-2021||Editorials||The quest to beat Covid-19||On Wednesday, at a meeting chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the government decided to postpone the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) examinations for Class 12 students — a review meeting on June 1 will decide subsequent dates. The government also decided to cancel Class 10 board exams — and said results would be deter-mined by an objective criteria developed by the board. The decision comes in the wake of a record number of daily Covid cases across the country — many states and cities have already imposed restrictions; schools in 11 states are closed; health systems are strained; and lives are at stake. This has been a disruptive year for students — away from their schools and friends, forced to cope with new ways to study online, with their universe restricted to their private rooms and homes. For underprivileged students, the struggle has been even greater — without the same levels of access to digital learning, and somehow studying in settings where the idea of a private room is an unthinkable luxury. And for all those in the crucial classes of 10th and 12th, after studying for months, Wednesday’s decision will come across as demotivating. But there is no choice, and the government has taken the right call. It should also consider cancelling, instead of just postponing, the Class 12 exams and getting all stakeholders — central universities, board officials, school associations, parent and student representatives — to come up with an alternative evaluation structure for the transition to higher educational institutions.But even as students are being asked to reconfigure their lives — the Class 10 and 12 exams, for good or bad, is often seen as a transformative moment in the life of a young student in India — it is business-as-usual for those who exercise political and religious power. The Kumbh continues in Haridwar, risking hundreds of thousands of lives — even though the gods would well understand if devotees find an alternative way to pray this year. Political rallies continue in Bengal — and this newspaper found that no social distancing norms are being followed by any party after visiting three distinct public meetings on Tuesday. As students are asked to sacrifice, rightly given the circumstances, for a safer India, perhaps their elders — who claim to speak for the nation and religion — could do the same.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/the-quest-to-beat-covid19-101618407771559.html
14-04-2021||Editorials||A new chapter in the Election Commission||Sushil Chandra is India’s new chief election commissioner. The context of his appointment is important. He takes over from his predecessor, Sunil Arora, at a time when the Election Commission of India (ECI) is conducting a fiercely contested, bitterly polarising, and occasionally violent election in West Bengal. He also takes over when ECI has taken action against campaigners — most recently, chief minister Mamata Banerjee and Bharatiya Janata Party leader Rahul Sinha in Bengal for violating the model code of conduct. Mr Chandra’s ascension also comes at a time when the Opposition has been raising doubts and questions about the independence of ECI. All of this makes it incumbent for Mr Chandra, a former Indian Revenue Service officer, to credibly fulfil the mandate of ECI — one of independent India’s finest independent institutions with a history of protecting and expanding the democratic right to choose one’s representatives. There are longer-term structural issues in the Indian electoral system which need to be addressed. But in the more immediate context, ECI must be fair and seen to be fair. This requires a consistent, rather than selective, application of principles; a firm crackdown on the increasing hate speech witnessed during campaigns; a clear approach to the use of religious symbols and rhetoric, from any side, for political mobilisation; and a push for more transparency when it comes to electoral bonds and political finance. There is an increasing perception that those at the helm of India’s independent institutions are too aligned with executive preferences. Mr Chandra has an opportunity to build on ECI’s stellar record in India’s public life and ensure that elections — a proud symbol of India’s constitutional and democratic traditions — are truly free and fair, by being independent and following the law in letter and spirit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/a-new-chapter-in-the-election-commission-101618407711646.html
