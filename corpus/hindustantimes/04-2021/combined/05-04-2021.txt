The friend and his associate was arrested in connection with the case, police said.The dead man, identified as Deepak Kumar, ran an electrical and motor rewinding shop in Shahdara. Those arrested were identified as tax consultant Rajneesh Kumar Jain, and his associate property dealer 51-year-old Shamsher Singh. The murder took place at Jain’s rented flat in Arjun Nagar near Karkardooma and the body was transported over a kilometer away to Karkardooma Institutional Area in a Santro car, police said.Deputy commissioner of police (Shahdara) R Sathiyasundaram said on January 23, the Anand Vihar police were informed about an unidentified body near the MTNL building in Karkardooma Institutional Area. The body was preserved at a government hospital mortuary as nobody in the neighbourhood could identify it. The DCP said the police uploaded the dead man’s photograph and physical description on to the zonal integrated police network (ZIPNET)..Twelve days later, DCP Sathiyasundaram said, a person named Lalit approached the police and identified the dead man as his brother. The autopsy was conducted and its report confirmed that Kumar died of strangulation and blunt force trauma to the head. A murder case was registered, and the investigating teams questioned Kumar’s relatives, friends, and people working at his shop.“We finally zeroed in on Kumar’s friend Jain and interrogated him. Jain confessed to the crime and his interrogation also led to the arrest of his associate Singh,” added the DCP.Police said Jain revealed that he had borrowed ₹1 lakh from Kumar. As Kumar had taken the money on loan too, he was under pressure from private lenders to return it. To avoid the money lenders, Kumar had started living at Jain’s house from January 18, they added.On January 22 night, an argument allegedly broke out between Jain and Kumar over the issue. Jain allegedly hit Kumar with a blunt object and then strangled him to death. Jain later allegedly called Singh and the duo shifted Kumar’s body, said the DCP.“They threw Kumar’s bag, clothes, and an electrical equipment kit in the Yamuna from the Wazirabad area,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/murder-of-electrician-solved-after-72-days-was-killed-by-man-who-borrowed-1-lakh-from-him-101617647358202.html

His security guard, Sharma, was accompanying him. When they were about to get into their car the assailants sprayed bullets on the two, killing both. Sharma also opened fire in self defence, during which one of the assailants was killed, later identified as Jatan Khatri, an alleged sharpshooter of the Bhati gang.The case had been pursued by Pradhan’s younger brother Ravindra Nagar. He had filed a complaint against Bhati and his gang members under Section 302 (murder), Section 147 (rioting), Section 120-B (criminal conspiracy) at the Site V police station.A spokesperson for the Gautam Budh Nagar police commissionerate said that Bhati has never been sentenced in any case prior to this and teams will continue to work against organised crime.Police sources said that Bhati is presently lodged at the Sonbhadra district jail.

05-04-2021||Noida||Commuters troubled as part of CISF Road overflooded due to water pipeline damage||Ghaziabad: Thousands of commuters are facing a tough time for the last two days as a stretch of the CISF Road in Indirapuram has got overflooded due to the damage to a Ganga water pipeline in the area. Officials of the Ghaziabad development authority (GDA) said that the repair work is in progress and likely to get over by Tuesday. The CISF Road helps commuters from Vasundhara and Mohan Nagar reach NH-9. The carriageway from Vasundhara to NH-9 is already dug up due to a 2.5km pipeline laying project undertaken by the UP Jal Nigam since February last year and the road relaying work is likely to get complete by end of May. “Commuters were already facing issues with the dug-up road, and now they are suffering due to damage to the Ganga water pipeline which has overflooded a stretch of about 400 metres. As a result, residents of our high-rise have no exit left while vehicles often get stuck up on the flooded road,” said Kapil Tyagi, president of apartment owners association at Divyansh Pratham, a high-rise in Indirapuram. Residents said that the dug-up road and the recent damage to the water pipeline have compounded their problems. “We are not able to understand why the dug-up road is not being re-laid for over a year now. The water pipeline damage has further compounded problems. Thousands of vehicles are forced to use the other side of the CISF Road, resulting in snarls during peak hours,” said BK Pandey, a resident of Vaishali who works in Indirapuram. Under the Jal Nigam’s project, the newly laid pipeline will take the treated water from three sewage treatment plants in Indirapuram to river Hindon. Officials of GDA said that they have deployed teams to repair the damaged Ganga water pipeline. “It is likely that we will repair the damaged water pipeline by Tuesday morning. The damaged pipeline, however, has not hampered the water supply in the area,” said AK Chaudhary, executive engineer of GDA. Officials of the UP Jal Nigam said that the work for repair of the dug-up road is held up due to pending payments. “The payment is pending on account of share of local body which is the Ghaziabad municipal corporation. However, we have asked the contractor to get the road re-laid,” said Keshav Kumar, chief engineer of UP Jal Nigam. When asked, MS Tanwar, municipal commissioner, said, “The decision has been made about the payment to the Jal Nigam’s pipeline project at CISF Road. The payment will be released soon.”The project has been taken up under the Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) scheme and proposed for laying pipeline of about 2.5km in length.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/commuters-troubled-as-part-of-cisf-road-overflooded-due-to-water-pipeline-damage-101617646935545.html
05-04-2021||Noida||Citizens’ committee to keep an eye on Jalpura animal shelter||GREATER NOIDA: A supervision committee, comprising five citizens, formed by the Greater Noida authority has suggested that facilities at the animal shelter in Jalpura should be upgraded.The authority, on March 29, had formed two committees, one of which comprised officials, to probe into allegations of negligence that allegedly led to the death of 20 bovines at the shelter. The other committee, comprising local citizens, to keep an eye on this facility, said officials.“We have suggested that fodder quantity, drinking water, shed and other services should be increased as existing facilities are not adequate,” said Harinder Bhati, one of the members of the supervision committee that visited the shelter Monday. There are around 1,600 bovines at this facility as of now and the authority provides ₹30 daily for per bovine for arrangement of fodder, said officials.“The amount of ₹30 per bovine is not adequate. Therefore, we have requested that the amount be increased to ₹85 daily and the authority is working this,” said Bhati.The Greater Noida authority chief executive officer (CEO) Narendra Bhooshan said he had ordered for filing of an FIR, after alleged negligence came forward in the probe in running the shelter.“We got filed an FIR against those responsible for negligence and a chargesheet is being prepared. The committee of citizens can visit the shelter as and when they wish, to check if the shelter is being properly managed. We will provide adequate facilities at the shelter,” said Bhooshan.The Ecotech 3 police on March 28 arrested four persons, including two officials of the authority, in connection with the deaths of cattle at Kanha Gaushala in Jalpura. The issue had come to the fore on March 25 after a video purportedly showing starving or dead cattle went viral on social media, after which several animal rights activists had rushed to the shelter with fodder and medical supplies. Activists alleged that the officials arranged food and medicines only after “being exposed”.Activists who had visited the shelter, which is run by the authority, had alleged that starvation and absence of proper medical facilities were the main reasons behind the animal deaths. They had also alleged that at least 20 bovines died between March 24 and 25, and that dozens had died earlier and their bodies were disposed of. However, authority officials had claimed that only six bovines had died due to injuries, or due to polythene consumption.The authority also named a vet and an engineer, and the in-charge of the shelter and a compounder, of the authority in the case filed under Indian Penal Code (IPC) sections 201, 409, 429, 34 and 120B, and relevant sections of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act.The arrested persons were identified as Sheetal Prakash Tiwari, supervisor, Satendra Kumar, compounder, Dr Prem Chand, vet, and Ramesh Chandra, engineer. However, all were released on bail the same day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/citizens-committee-to-keep-an-eye-on-jalpura-animal-shelter-101617646934953.html
05-04-2021||Noida||Social impact survey for second phase of Noida airport begins||GREATER NOIDA: Expediting the process to acquire land for the second phase of the Noida International Airport at Jewar, the Gautam Budh Nagar district administration decided to notify Section 4 of the Land Act on Wednesday, which initiates the social impact assessment.The provisions of the Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013, state that the concerned agency can take two-six months to carry out the survey and submit the report. This survey studies the socio-economic condition of farmers, whose land is to be acquired for a said project. Once the assessment is done, Section 11 of Act will be implemented, inviting objections from the public, after which the government will implement Section 19 and compensation will be decided and distributed to land owners, as per rules.To be used for the third runway and commercial MRO (maintenance, repair and overhaul work of airplanes) centre, the six villages for which the survey will be taken up are Karauli Bangar, Dayanat Pur, Kureb, Ranhera, Birampur and Mundera as part of the second phase of construction. About 1,185 hectare of private land has to be acquired from these. Under the first phase, 1,334 hectares was acquired on which the work is likely to begin at the ground by mid-2021.“The state-owned Gautam Buddha University, which has conducted the assessment in the past, is likely to start the survey work this week. The study is a mandate under the Act in order to find out how many people will be losing their agricultural land, properties and livelihood. The assessment team will also have to ascertain how many people will lose livelihood in an indirect manner due to the acquisition,” said Balram Singh, additional district magistrate, Gautam Budh Nagar.The acquisition will require almost ₹2,891 crore, for which the administration has already received ₹1,084 crore from Uttar Pradesh government. The remaining amount has to be arranged by the Noida, Greater Noida, and Yamuna Expressway authorities.Out of the 1363 hectare of land needed for the second phase, 1,185 hectare which is to be acquired is privately owned. The remaining land is already owned by the state government.Besides this, the Uttar Pradesh government has approved ₹22 crore for the construction and development of religious and other recreational structures which will be displaced due to the acquisition under phase 1.Officials said farmers are shifting into a newly-developed airport township at the Jewar Bangar area. They said the farmers, who are getting residential plots in this township, had been demanding religious and cultural places. The land, on which almost 30 religious structures stand, across communities, will be acquired once construction activity begins under phase 1. Apart from temples and mosques, multiple small religious shrines, Eidgah, Ambedkar sthals and one madarsa will be developed. As many as 3,627 people have been displaced from their homes due to the acquisition so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/social-impact-survey-for-second-phase-of-noida-airport-begins-101617646874920.html
05-04-2021||Kolkata||As Bengal gears up for phase 3 polls, Covid-19 cases shoot up||The daily count of Covid-19 cases in West Bengal shot up nine times on April 4 since February 26 when the Election Commission of India announced the dates for the crucial state assembly polls, state health department data reveals.“With elections going on, political parties are organising huge public rallies and roadshows every day where thousands of people are gathering. Precautions, such as social distancing and wearing masks, have taken a back seat. Under such circumstances, there has been a staggering rise in Covid-19 cases,” said Sukumar Mukherjee, member of the expert committee that was set up in 2020 to advise chief minister Mamata Banerjee on pandemic-related matters. Bengal’s active Covid-19 cases have more than doubled since March 27 when the first phase of elections was held. With Covid-19 cases rising sharply, beds in private hospitals are also running out. Occupancy in government hospitals has also seen a sharp rise. Data available with the state health department reveals that while only 216 new cases were reported from across the state on February 26, the count went up to 1,957 on April 4. While there were only 4,608 active cases on March 27, it went up to 10,153 on April 4. While the first two phases of elections, in which 60 seats went to polls, have already been completed, six more phases remain. The third phase, in which 31 constituencies spreading over three districts would be going to polls, is scheduled for April 6. Even though the cases have shot up alarmingly, the death rate hasn’t seen such a sharp rise. While on February 26, the state had reported three deaths, on April 4, the state reported 4 fatalities. On February 26 only 198 beds out of 6,736 beds in government hospitals were filled up which was just around 3%. On April 3, however, the occupancy went up to nearly 12% with 665 beds out of the 5,604 beds booked in government hospitals.The scenario was particularly worse in private hospitals. On February 26, only around 25% of the 1,007 hospital beds were filled. With Covid-19 cases rising, private hospitals have started increasing the number of beds. On April 3, out of 1,077 beds, 659 beds were booked which is around 61%. At least 11 hospitals in and around Kolkata have run out of beds. The maximum number of cases were being reported from Kolkata and North 24 Parganas. Out of the 1,957 cases, around 56% were reported from these two districts. While the daily count in Kolkata on April 4 was 634, in North 24 Parganas it was 462. The state government has ramped up the daily testing from around 20,000 in February-end to more than 26,000 now. “While we need to increase our testing, we also need to go for contact tracing of the infected patients. Isolation of infected people and proper surveillance is very important. All these have taken a back seat along with maintaining safety protocols as a result of which cases are on the rise,” said Manas Gumta, general secretary of Association of Health Service Doctors in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/as-bengal-gears-up-for-phase-3-polls-covid-19-cases-shoot-up-101617645076041.html
05-04-2021||Gurugram||Soon, vaccination for Gurguram industrial employees at govt sites||The Gurugram health department will set up separate vaccination camps for all industrial employees in the city, officials informed on Monday. The industrial associations in Manesar said they will begin vaccination camps from April 7.“A team from the health department led by the chief medical officer met with the industrial association in Manesar on Monday and it was decided that vaccination for employees working there will be done at nearby government sites for faster response in case beneficiaries have adverse reactions,” said MP Singh, district immunisation officer.Vaccination drives for industrial employees will be done at government health centres, community centres and dispensaries. On March 31, the district health department allowed corporates to tie up with private hospitals to hold vaccination camps for their staff on office premises. However, the health department has now offered to hold camps for industry staff at government sites. “Our government staff is already trained and equipped with all medical facilities, especially on-time ambulances. At government facilities, there is also enough space to follow social distancing and protocols like monitoring the beneficiary for half an hour after the vaccination,” Singh added. As per health department data, a total of 27,785 beneficiaries, including healthcare workers and frontline workers, were vaccinated in the district on Monday. Of the total, 26,571 were above the age of 45, and 7,779 beneficiaries were vaccinated at 56 private vaccination sites.Overall,216 vaccination sites, including 116 government sites, have been set up.Virendra Yadav, chief medical officer of Gurugram who led the discussion with the industrial association, said that vaccination at industries will start as soon as they send the list of beneficiaries. “We have discussed the details and should get information, like the number of beneficiaries, within two days. Thereafter, camps will be set up and vaccination drive can start,” said Yadav. He further said that arrangement and distribution of vaccines will be done depending on the list of beneficiaries given by the industrial association.Industrial associations in Manesar said that they will start regular vaccination camps from April 7. “We will hold vaccination camps in every sector and ensure that eligible employees and workers are inoculated to the maximum,” said Pawan Yadav, president, IMT Manesar Industrial Association.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/soon-vaccination-for-gurguram-industrial-employees-at-govt-sites-101617644834755.html

Around 4 lakh vehicles cross the Sirhaul toll on a weekday.While Delhi traffic police has been regularly issuing alerts on social media since March 19, cautioning commuters to avoid the stretch till May 15 due to the ongoing cable laying work by Delhi Transco Limited, officials suspect the removal of jersey barriers might have led to an increase in congestion on Monday.Due to the ongoing work, commuters coming from Bijwasan and Dwarka no longer have access to the service lanes of the expressway to head towards the Indira Gandhi International (IGI) Airport, Mahipalpur, or for taking a U-turn below the Mahipalpur flyover to head towards Gurugram.Instead, they have to converge with the traffic coming from Gurugram on the main carriageway of NH-48 to head towards any of these directions.“Only on the first day of the work had Delhi traffic police officials managed traffic manually. Due to the severity of congestion, from the next day onwards, they had placed jersey barriers at an angle, leaving vehicles travelling from Dwarka and Bijwasan with a dedicated lane of the carriageway to join NH-48. On Monday morning, however, Delhi traffic police removed the jersey barriers and reverted to manual management of traffic,” said an official at the control room of National Highways Authority of India (NHAI).The official quoted above said that instead of the usual converging of traffic, Delhi traffic police officials either allowed vehicles travelling from Dwarka and Bijwasan passage or those travelling on the expressway from Gurugram at intervals, resulting in a heavy snarl.While Delhi traffic police officials were unavailable for comment, DCP (traffic) DK Bhardwaj of the Gurugram police said that he will speak to Delhi traffic police on Tuesday morning regarding the matter. “With traffic extending till Gurugram on Monday, we will take stock on the matter from Delhi traffic police on Tuesday to determine the date till the work at Dwarka Link Road is likely to continue and the traffic management measures taken for it. Accordingly, we will issue an alert of our own for Gurugram residents as well,” said Bhardwaj.Daily commuters said that over the past three weeks the congestion was usually less than two kilometres long --between Samalka and Mahipalpur flyover -- though it was longer on Monday.“Over the last three weeks, the congestion was limited till Samalka. However, today (Monday) it was more severe. The stretch has been taking me 10 minutes to cross since the work began, however, it took me nearly 30 minutes today. Instead of continuous moving traffic, due to manual traffic management, vehicle movement was stationary for two to three-minute intervals, which resulted in a four-kilometre vehicle queue,” said Sahil Bhalla, a resident of Panchsheel Park in Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/cable-work-manual-traffic-management-results-in-4-km-traffic-snarl-on-dwarka-link-road-101617644775452.html
05-04-2021||Gurugram||Gurugram district administration orders police to issue 1000 challans daily for Covid-19 violations, soon surprise checks at weddings, functions||For the third day straight, Gurugram recorded over 550 new Covid-19 cases on Monday taking the total active case load to 3,168. This is the first time this year that the active case count crossed the 3,000 mark.On Monday, Gurugram deputy commissioner Yash Garg asked the police to increase their vigilance and issue at least 1,000 challans each day to those who violated health protocols such as masks and social distancing. Municipal corporation officials too were asked to resume issuing fines in their respective zonesDuring a meeting with administration and police officials on Monday, Yash Garg, DC Gurugram, instructed that prior permissions are a must for any programme to be held in the district from now on. “Gurugram Police should issue at least 1000 challans per day and the Municipal Corporation officials must also issue at least 100 challans in each of their zones. Special checking should be done at crowded places like markets, malls, big hospitals. Standard operating procedure (SOP) and Covid-19 appropriate behaviour should be strictly complied with,” said Garg, during the meeting. The municipal corporation of Gurugram (MCG) had issued fines last year over Covid-19 health protocol violations but suspended it in July as the focus shifted to other measures such as ensuring protocols in public places, and due to a dip in new cases. The practice of issuing challans was first ordered in March last year. Even till July last year, the civic body had not issued too many challans -- less than 6000 versus Gurugram Police’s nearly 13,000.

05-04-2021||Delhi||Centre writes to Delhi govt on irregularities in identification of Covid-19 vaccination beneficiaries||The Centre on Monday wrote to the Delhi government, pointing to irregularities in the identification of Covid-19 vaccination beneficiaries, below the age of 45 years, by some private vaccination centres.In the letter to the Principal Secretary (Health), Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi (GNCTD), it has been pointed out by the central government that there have been serious lapses in the registration of beneficiaries by the VIMHANS (Vidyasagar Institute of Mental Health, Neuro and Allied Sciences) located at Nehru Nagar area in the North-East District of Delhi, operating as a private Covid vaccination centre. VIMHANS has been found to register beneficiaries below the age of 45 years as Health Care Workers (HCWs) & Front Line Workers (FLWs) and vaccinate them.A release from the health ministry said, "As per provisions of the ongoing Covid-I9 vaccination drive, citizens above 45 years of age (from 1st April 2021) are being vaccinated along with Health Care Workers (HCWs) and Front Line Workers (FLWs) above 18 years of age as per the recommendations of NEGVAC. CoWIN (Covid Vaccine Intelligence Work) sample data (l9th March-3rd April 2021) of vaccinated beneficiaries from this private CVC verified by the health ministry, revealed that many beneficiaries lie outside the ambit of the eligible beneficiaries (not under the identified priority populations groups), in violation of the guidelines laid down by the union health ministry."Noting that vaccines are a "precious commodity", the Centre said these serious lapses at the VIMHANS CVC in terms of compliance of the Covid-19 vaccination guidelines harm the countrywide vaccination exercise as eligible beneficiaries may get deprived of vaccination.The Delhi administration has been asked to immediately issue a show-cause notice to VIMHANS regarding such wrong practices which violate Covid-19 vaccination norms and seek a written explanation from them within the next 48 hours. The appropriate monetary fine may also be imposed on the hospital.Further, it has been suggested that the department of the hospital may be approached if the explanation to the show cause notice is found "unsatisfactory".In another case, the Delhi government, in pursuance of the advice from the health ministry, has issued a show-cause notice to Bensups Hospital, Sector-12 Dwarka, Delhi for violation of the guidelines issued by the Centre on the eligible groups of the population for receiving Covid vaccination, where persons below the age of 45 years have been wrongly registered as health care workers and frontline workers.India had started Covid-19 vaccination drive was rolled out on January 16 with two vaccines -- Covishield (Oxford-AstraZeneca's vaccine manufactured by Serum Institute of India) and Covaxin (manufactured by Bharat Biotech Limited).India commenced its second phase of the Covid-19 vaccination drive to inoculate people above 60 years and those over 45 with comorbidities against the coronavirus from March 1.The third phase began on April 1 for all above 45 years of age.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/centre-writes-to-delhi-govt-on-irregularities-in-identification-of-covid-19-vaccination-beneficiaries-101617643674430.html

05-04-2021||Patna||Centre approves mega food park in Muzaffarpur||In a major step towards industrialisation in Bihar, the Centre has approved a mega food park at Motipur block of Muzaffarpur district. An announcement to this effect was made jointly by union agriculture, farmer’s welfare and food processing industries Narendra Singh Tomar and Bihar’s industry minister Shahnawaz Hussain in New Delhi on Monday.This would be the first mega food park to be developed by Bihar Industrial Area Development Authority (BIADA). Earlier, a food park under private sector was opened at Mansi in Khagaria district at a cost of ₹127.60 crores.Giving details about the project, Tomar said, “An amount of ₹103 crore would be spent on developing the common structure of the plant and it will have 30 industry units. Once these units are established, the park will have ₹300 crore of additional investment. This means that the mega food park will have an investment of ₹400 crore ( ₹103 crore from Centre and state and remaining through investments) and it will generate opportunity for 5000 people.”The proposal to develop the park was prepared by BIADA under the guidance of chief minister (CM) Nitish Kumar and it will be developed in 78 acres. “The total cost is ₹103 crore, in which ₹50 crore will be provided by the Centre,” said Hussain. “This food park will definitely generate employment opportunities and go a long way in opening the doors for industrialization. I congratulate Bihar CM Nitish Kumar and industry minister Shahnawaz Hussain and I am confident that the project will start soon and help farmers and unemployed youths,” said Tomar. “The remaining amount of the project will be provided by the BIADA and soon we will start making the DPR,” said additional chief secretary (industries) Brajesh Mehrotra.The central government had envisaged a project for developing 42 mega food parks, of which 40 had been approved. The Mega Food Park Scheme (MFPS) aims at providing modern infrastructure facilities for food processing.As on September 2020, the ministry has accorded final approval to 37 MFPs in 23 states/UTs which are under different stages of implementation. Out of this, 19 MFPs are operational. As per the scheme guidelines, each fully operational food park will provide direct/indirect employment to about 5000 persons. The scheme has the primary objective of providing modern infrastructure facilities for the food processing along the value chain from the farm to the market. It will include creation of infrastructure near farm (i.e. collection centres and primary processing centres), transportation, logistics and centralised processing centres etc. This will have an impact on increased realization of farmers, reduction in wastage and creation of an efficient supply chain backed by collection centres, primary processing centres and logistic infrastructure.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/centre-approves-mega-food-park-in-muzaffarpur-101617641174643.html
05-04-2021||Patna||Intensive testing in containment zones as Covid cases spike in Bihar||The state health department has decided to use rapid antigen kits for intensive testing in containment zones of Patna, which has seen the maximum spike in cases post-Holi, while scaling up tests through real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), a gold standard test for coronavirus disease (Covid-19). With 935 new Covid-19 cases on Monday, Bihar reported the highest single day spike in cases this year of which 432 were from Patna. The state capital reported 372 cases out of the 864 new infections in the state on Sunday. Sharing the gravity of the situation, he said, Bihar reported 3,422 cases between March 29 and April 4. This was more than 15 times the cases reported in the first week of March. “We are constantly increasing our capacity of RT PCR tests, but at the same time we have decided to test as many people as possible in containment zones (Bihar had 1,124 active containment zones on Monday) through rapid antigen kits,” said Pratyaya Amrit, Bihar’s principal secretary, health. He said Bihar had sufficient beds available in health facilities as 95% of the total active cases were under home isolation. Bihar had 3,560 active cases till April 4, when the number of new infections was 864. Amrit said the availability of beds for Covid-19 patients had increased from 60 to 110 at Patna AIIMS. The number of ICU beds had also gone up from 20 to 30 at the institute. Besides, 100 beds were made functional at the Patna Medical College Hospital (PMCH), the state health brass added. An additional 100 beds to the existing 100 were being made operational at the Nalanda Medical College Hospital (NMCH), which was once declared a dedicated Covid-19 hospital last May before it began admitting non-Covid patients when the situation eased later last year. Amrit said the ESIC Hospital at Bihta, on the outskirts of Patna, would again be made functional exclusively for Covid-19 patients. Doctors and nurses from the Armed Forces Medical Corps would manage the facility at Bihta, where the DRDO had managed a 500-bed Covid care facility last year. “We are deputing 50 nurses from the state health sector to support the facility at Bihta,” said Amrit. He said arrangements were also being done for recommencing Covid-care facility at the erstwhile Hotel Patliputra Ashok. Together with tracking, testing and treatment of Covid-19 patients, Amrit exhorted those above 45 years of age to take vaccination. He said the state was vaccinating around 2.25 lakh people on a daily basis and the exercise had been taken up on a “mission mode” with a target to vaccinate most of the 1.80 crore target group population of 45 years and above. Amrit said the infection was more virulent this time and portends ominous signs if people were lax in following Covid appropriate behavior like wearing of mask, maintaining social distancing, using hand sanitiser and avoiding crowded places. He said the chief minister was monitoring the Covid-19 situation on a daily basis and after the crisis management group meeting last Saturday, would hold a meeting with districts magistrates and superintendents of police on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/intensive-testing-in-containment-zones-as-covid-cases-spike-in-bihar-101617641114672.html

05-04-2021||Pune||Office-goers face challenges adjusting to changed office timings||The new restrictions imposed in Pune by the district administration has made life difficult for office-goers like Dipti Mohite. “Our office timings were 10 am to 6 pm earlier which were changed to 9 am to 5 pm by the office administration, but I travel by the public transport bus daily from home to office. As my husband also works in another private company and his timings are almost the same, I have to manage to go to office either by a private auto rickshaw or now looking for share rides with another office colleagues,” said Mohite. Thousands of officegoers, workers working at market shops and small factories all around the district are facing a similar situation Vipul Alekar, a businessman in Hadapsar said, “In our factory there are 15 workers and we have called them in two shifts for work after the new restrictions were given. As most of them stay nearby, they come walking or travel on bike but continuing work in these changed timings is really costing us financially as well as the business has gone down by almost 50 per cent.” At Laxmi road and Tulshibaug market, shop owners call workers early in the morning and at around 5 to 5.30 pm shops are closed before the night curfew starts at 6 pm. From 5 pm to 6 pm, there is a massive crowd seen across city roads, as there is a rush to return home before the restrictions begin. Most officer goers stop on the way home to buy vegetables, groceries and other household items. Archana Somavanshi, branch manager at one of the courier services on Tilak road said, “As ours is a service oriented work, we need to keep our shop open for the public. Our regular office timings have now been changed to 8.30 am to 5.30 pm. I manage my household works of cooking food for kids and other preparations early in the morning, and then return back home at around 6 pm.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/officegoers-face-challenges-adjusting-to-changed-office-timings-101617639614678.html
05-04-2021||Pune||Over a million doses administered in Pune, 8% of population get first dose||Pune has inoculated 8 per cent of its population in the district as over a million doses have been given. As of Tuesday, the district has seen 10.75 lakh vaccinations of which 9.88 lakh have got only the first dose and of those who got the first jab 87,775 have got the second dose. The district has over 523 vaccination sites. The district has vaccinated 5.23 lakh men and 4.64 lakh women. Of the total doses administered, 9.78 lakh are of Covishield and remaining Covaxin. Since the past one week Pune has reported the highest per day vaccination in the state and so the administration now hopes to vaccinate one lakh beneficiaries per day. To ensure vaccination for all in the city, the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has issued orders to ensure that those working in essential services shops must get the vaccine as prescribed by the Government of India and also the non-essential shops that remain close during the restrictions period must also get the vaccines as prescribed by the government norms. PMC has also issued guidelines to ensure vaccination of all employees in wedding halls. To increase vaccination, Sudhir Mehta, lead and coordinator, Pune Platform for Covid-19 Response, has asked the government to withdraw its latest directive which restricts further registration and vaccination of healthcare and frontline workers. He said, “With increased vaccination centres, our hospitals have recruited additional staff, most of whom are still not vaccinated. The volunteer groups who are the major drivers of our vaccination campaigns and smooth implementation are also not eligible for vaccination. This has taken us aback in our journey towards safeguarding Pune district that is going through an emergency crisis situation with close to 10,000 cases a day and average 50 daily deaths. We are witnessing deaths of 27–28-year-olds due to Covid, which is an alarming situation and is creating an apprehension amongst volunteer groups as well. Given the situation, volunteers, frontline and healthcare workers who are not covered by vaccination and do not fall under eligible categories are now backing out. This will result in a dramatic fall in the daily vaccination numbers due to healthcare staff and volunteer short staff.” Ensuring protection against the virus Sites conducting vaccination in Pune district: 523 Government: 407 Private: 116 Total vaccination doses: 1,079,352 Dose 1: 991,474 Dose 2: 87,878 Male: 525,554 Female:465,834 Covishield: 981,906 Covaxin: 97,446 Vaccinations by age: 18-25 years: 25,205 25-40 years: 123,831 40-60 years: 374,599 Above 60 years:467,679 *data from Government of India’s Co-WIN dashboard||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/over-a-million-doses-administered-in-pune-8-of-population-get-first-dose-101617638954647.html
05-04-2021||Lucknow||Mission 2022: Akhilesh criss-crosses state, covers 40 districts||Samajwadi Party (SP) national president Akhilesh Yadav is touring the state like never before with the 2022 UP assembly elections in mind, travelling to nearly 40 districts and all regions of the state, including Bundelkhand.He has not only left all other top Opposition leaders behind in this respect but appears to have outdone himself in spending time on the road.Yadav’s tours now also involve frequent overnight stays in the districts. The sequence began with a three-day visit to his Lok Sabha constituency Azamgarh in eastern Uttar Pradesh in December.During these visits, he has addressed cadre training camps, kisan mahapanchayats, public meetings and press conferences. He has also gone to temples, besides Muslim and Buddhist places of worship.At all the districts, Akhilesh posted pictures of him amid the dense crowds on his social media accounts. Most of them were road trips but he did use an aeroplane on a couple of visits, including one to Chitrakoot.In Etawah, he addressed a gathering from atop a tractor. He also stood on the roof of his rath (a luxury election campaign bus) at his Aligarh kisan mahapanchayat. In Rampur, he not only flagged off the 350-km-long Samajwadi Cycle Yatra to Lucknow, but also pedalled the first 10 km of the route along with party workers. He even travelled on a UP roadways bus on the way to Etawah.“The way crowds are gathering indicates how restive the people are to vote the BJP out and bring back the Samajwadi Party,” said SP state spokesperson and former minister Rajendra Chaudhary.The tours have also quelled the criticism that he earlier did not hit the streets the way his father and party founder Mulayam Singh Yadav did when he led the party.Keeping his attack focused only on the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Akhilesh Yadav never spoke about any other rival political party, be it the Congress or the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP).Among his political rivals, BSP chief Mayawati has not travelled across the state at all, while Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra visited a few districts such as Saharanpur and Mathura. She is likely to go to four eastern UP districts to address kisan mahapanchayats in Varanasi, Mirzapur, Sonbhadra, Prayagraj and Gorakhpur this month.“It is good that Akhilesh Yadav is doing such hectic tours and engaged in taking on the BJP much ahead of the polls. There is no other way, if he and his party have to fight the BJP and aspire to win back power. As of now, it is only his party and he who are in a position to take on BJP well. Such hard work and some strategic alliances, if he does them, would certainly help in the fight,” said Prof SK Dwivedi, a political analyst and former head of the department of political science, Lucknow University.Dwivedi added: “Before this, his solo Kranti Rath tour of the state in 2011 shortly before the 2012 UP assembly elections is still etched in public memory.”Mulayam had credited Akhilesh Yadav and his Kranti Rath campaign for making the SP win a full majority for the first time in its electoral history. That achievement saw Akhilesh Yadav becoming the Uttar Pradesh chief minister for the first time in 2012.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/mission-2022-akhilesh-criss-crosses-state-covers-40-districts-101617636855475.html
05-04-2021||Other||2 Telugu CRPF jawans killed in Bijapur encounter were to marry soon||The two Telugu jawans of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), who were killed along with 20 others in the exchange of fire with the extremists of the Communist Party of India (Maoist) in the forests of Bijapur in Chhattisgarh on Saturday, were to get married soon, their family members said.While the wedding ceremony of Routhu Jagadish (27), a resident of Gajularega area in Andhra Pradesh’s Vizianagaram town, was fixed for May 22, the parents of Sakhamuri Muralikrishna (28) of Gudipudi village of Sattenapalli block in Guntur district, were looking for a suitable match for him.“Jagadish spoke to me on Friday and discussed the arrangements to be made for the marriage next month. He said he would come to Vizianagaram this week on a holiday to shop for the wedding and other personal works. We were all waiting for him. Unfortunately, we got this sad news,” Jagadish’s father, Routhu Simhachalam, a worker in a petrol bunk, said.Jagadish’s mother, Ramanamma, was inconsolable. She wailed with her son’s photograph in her hands. His sister, Saraswati, got married last year.“Jagadish joined the CRPF in 2010 and got into the Cobra squad because of his daring nature. He was a very active and jovial person. He has lots of friends in Vizianagaram. Whenever he came to the town, it was like a festive atmosphere,” Ramesh, one of his friends in the neighbourhood, said.Hundreds of youths took out a rally by holding tricolour, placards and banners in Vizianagaram town, raising “Jagadish Amar Rahe (long live Jagadish)” slogans. They observed a shutdown at Gajularega area as a mark of respect to the departed soul.Muralikrishna, another CRPF jawan, from Guntur district, also joined the CRPF in 2010 and had been posted in the Cobra-210 wing. His parents, Ravindra Babu, a private employee, and Vijaya Kumar, a homemaker, were also planning to get him married this summer.“The family recently built a new house in view of Muralikrishna’s marriage. He came home in February on a holiday and gave a green signal to his parents to look for a match. He told them he would come back to the village once the marriage is settled. But we got this bad news yesterday,” one of his relatives said.Expressing shock over the killing of two bright Telugu CRPF jawans, Andhra Pradesh chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy announced an ex gratia of ₹30 lakh each to the bereaved families.He extended his heartfelt condolences to the family members of Jagadish and Muralikrishna and prayed for strength to the families to overcome the grief, an official release from the chief minister’s office said.Meanwhile, the police administration in the Telangana districts of Bhadradri Kothagudem, Mulugu and Jayashankar Bhupalpally, sounded a high alert in the villages that border Chhattisgarh. The administration is on alert suspecting the possible sneaking of Maoists and their supporting tribals into Telangana crossing the Godavari river.A senior police official in the Bhadradri Kothagudem district said Terrem area, where the deadly encounter took place, was hardly 60 kilometres away from Charla block in the district.“Whenever there is a massive encounter in Chhattisgarh forests, the Maoists attempt to cross the Godavari river and take shelter in the border villages of Telangana for sometime before retreating to their hideouts,” the official said on condition of anonymity.Within hours of the encounter killings, hundreds of police forces belonging to the CRPF, Greyhounds (elite anti-Maoist forces of the Telangana police) and special party police of the districts, swung into action and intensified the combing operations.“In coordination with the Chhattisgarh Police, we have kept a watch on all such areas where there is a possibility of the Maoists entering Telangana for shelter,” the official said.Intensified checking of all vehicles coming from across the border has begun and the police forces are also posted along the Godavari river to check any ferrying of suspects from Chhattisgarh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/2-telugu-crpf-jawans-killed-in-bijapur-encounter-were-to-marry-soon-101617634815602.html
05-04-2021||Pune||Allocate 80% of oxygen produced to hospitals: State to industry||Pune: The Maharashtra government has instructed all oxygen producers and suppliers to reserve 80 per cent of supply for medical purposes, given the surge of Covid in the state. Maharashtra chief secretary Sitaram Kunte issued guidelines for the same and instructed local authorities to monitor the supply. Last year, the state government had issued the same restrictions on oxygen supply in August and September, but as cases came down, oxygen supply for industrial purposes was eased. Covid patients require oxygen and its demand is increasing from all parts of the state. Pune district collector Rajesh Deshmukh held a meeting with oxygen suppliers recently and instructed them to keep a smooth supply of oxygen to all hospitals in the city and district. The Pune district administration instructed the industries to register their oxygen demand and take permission from authorities while making additional demands. The administration claimed that they are ensuring that there will be smooth supply of oxygen and no shortage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/allocate-80-of-oxygen-produced-to-hospitals-state-to-industry-101617634814375.html
05-04-2021||Pune||Rural administration adopts early detection and case management policy||As the daily caseload in Pune district has been on the rise, the district administration is emphasising on early detection of cases in rural parts of Pune district. The rural administration is also focusing on the early management of a Covid case to prevent further deterioration of the patient. Pune Zilla Parishad claimed that this policy has become instrumental in ensuring the availability of the ventilator beds and the low mortality rate. “We have focused on the early detection of the cases with the help of Asha workers. Our challenge is to detect the onset of any sort of distress in 48 hours. Currently, our rate of detection is around 97 per cent. Only three percent of the cases are coming to us after 48 hours. Now, our goal is to detect these 97 cases in 0-24 hours,” said Ayush Prasad, CEO, Pune Zilla Parishad. On Sunday, Pune district recorded 12,472 Covid positive cases in a single day and 2,844 were reported from the rural parts. As the urban parts have been experiencing shortage of critical care beds, the Pune dashboard indicates the availability of the beds in rural parts. Ayush Prasad explained how the administration has been ensuring the availability of the beds in rural areas. “In Covid-19, generally the time window is of five to six days until the patient needs a ventilator. So, we are following very strict norms during this period. We are insisting on comprehensive blood tests and other tests. We are calculating the new score. It gives us an idea whether the condition of the patient will deteriorate. If it comes to this then we refer the patent to DCH from CCC and where efforts are taken to improve the patient’s condition,” said Prasad. He also claimed that if early management of Covid patients is properly done then the need of a ventilator could be avoided. On the other hand, rural police claimed that there has been a good response from rural parts to the adherence to the new restrictions and 12-hour curfew. “We have continued our action on the violators of Covid norms but in rural areas many are following the rules of restrictions by their own. The new heights of the Covid positive patients have reached the villages and people have become cautious,” said Milind Mohite, additional superintendent of police, Baramati Division.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/rural-administration-adopts-early-detection-and-case-management-policy-101617634454443.html
05-04-2021||Pune||Small-businesses, gym owners stare at losses during month-long restrictions||The restrictions announced in Pune last week has spiralled many businesses into unexpected losses, and the most affected are beauty parlours, and gymnasiums who feel that it is injustice to close down a place where residents can build better immunity to fight Covid-19. Jitendra Shirodkar was looking forward to his regular workouts at the Gold’s gym in Aundh when the mini lockdown was announced, which now have disturbed his daily exercise routine. “The government is stressing on lockdown and closing down gyms. This is totally wrong if they want people to build immunity, they should allow gyms to remain open,” Shirodkar said. ABS fitness downed the shutters on all their gyms in the city as soon as the announcement was made. “It is indeed very sad that we have to close the shutters once again, just when we had opened them a few months back. Last year was a complete loss and now just when we have opened up, the government calls for a lockdown. Gyms in fact are the safest place with all precautions in place. In the last two months, we have had no Covid positive cases at all of members coming in for exercises. The lockdown is going to not just affect the business but also the health of the people. If people don’t exercise, how will they gain immunity against such diseases,” said Shekhar Sable, founder, director, for ABS fitness. HIIT80, a boutique gym in Balewadi has found a way to reach out to its members while maintaining lockdown restrictions. “It is true that one needs to be healthy to maintain immunity and hence with the lockdown announcement, we have taken up giving online lessons to our members using social media. We are not making any money, but health comes first,” said Crispin Lamont, owner, HIIT80. The Tilak swimming tank which brought joy to several people who looked at respite from the heat also shut down. “Last year was a major loss and during the month of May we tend to have a good number of members, taking our earnings to around ₹60 to 70 lakh, but we are not sure of making up for the losses. What worries us more is that our coaches are suffering the most, for some of them, coaching is their livelihood,” said, Tilak tank secretary Amit Golwalkar. The malls wore a deserted look, with only the housekeeping staff going about for the last time before locking the doors. Westend mall in Aundh closed the doors from Sunday as soon as the lockdown was announced. The beauty parlours in the city are still unsure about the dates of closing shops. Sakhee beauty parlour owner Shaila Nagpure said, “We are open today, but unsure of how the day will be. We will be closing from Tuesday following the orders but this lockdown will affect us very badly and not sure if we will recover from losses.” Similarly, another beauty parlour Maria’s salon in Koregaon park too was operational. “We are closing from tomorrow but today there are not many clients walking in. This lockdown will be bad for us,” said Jenny, one of the hairdressers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/smallbusinesses-gym-owners-stare-at-losses-during-month-long-restrictions-101617634394506.html
05-04-2021||Pune||Mulshi: Activists arrange free buses for villagers to take the jab||With no connectivity, issues with the transport system and no Covid-19 vaccination centre in their villages –residents of Paud and 28 other villages in Mulshi taluka were clueless on how to get vaccinated until Ankush More – an activist decided to arrange a free bus ride service to the vaccination centre.A resident has to travel a minimum of 50 kilometres to get vaccinated at the village Male or Ambavane. More and other activists came out with the plan and now everyday 100 residents (senior citizens and 45 plus) are getting vaccinated since March 30. Until now 400 residents have been vaccinated.Most of these villages are in the back side of the Mulshi dam which makes transport connectivity a problem. There are 600 active Covid-19 cases in Mulshi taluka.“Last Friday, the vaccination centre had few issues so we did not take the villagers for vaccination otherwise the process is going smoothly. Most of the senior citizens in villages are living alone as their children are in cities so we are making sure that these people do not suffer and get vaccinated,” said Ankush More an activist and working president of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), Mulshi taluka.The total population of these villages are around 23,000. Near these villages there are also 42 small hamlets where most of the people work in farms.“We will be covering these people as well under the vaccination. Our members are reaching out to them personally and explaining the importance of vaccination,” said More.The buses will continue to provide service for two more months. Prior to a day before going to the vaccination, activists collect the list of members and submit it to the vaccination centres and accordingly everything is organised at the centre.“The bus system was a must otherwise these villagers might have ignored the vaccination process because state transport buses are not that frequent. This initiative is giving good promotion to vaccination drives and senior citizens who are taking vaccines are also promoting it nicely so villagers who were afraid to take vaccines are now coming in big numbers. Two days ago, we vaccinated 170 people in a day,” said Dr Sambhaji Satpute health department head, Ambavane.“The main purpose of starting the centre at Mulshi Khurd and Male was to reduce distance so more people come for vaccination,” added Satpute.Even before the rise of Covid-19, these activists used to run free ambulance service for villagers.“Our main aim was to get more and more people to get vaccinated. Once we are providing them transport service for free, they are getting ready to get vaccinated,” said Mahadeo Kondhare, president of Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), Mulshi taluka.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/mulshi-activists-arrange-free-buses-for-villagers-to-take-the-jab-101617634275576.html

05-04-2021||Pune||Ventilator bed shortage: Experts say requirement too high than availability in Pune||Pune: The non-availability of the ICU beds in Pune continued on Monday. The Covid dashboard on bed availability for Pune division revealed that no ventilator beds were available in Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) limits on Monday. The district administration claimed that 288 beds of all categories were made available Monday, but almost all the beds were occupied immediately. PMC officials said that 250-300 beds from all the categories would be added to the dashboard by Monday night. At the end of the day, the dashboard showed 439 beds from all the categories were added.“We are trying our level best to increase beds. We added 288 beds of all categories put together and the beds vanished almost immediately,” said Saurabh Rao, divisional commissioner. Manisha Naik, PMC’s assistant medical officer, said, “We have spoken to 23 hospitals on Monday. Currently we are registering the new beds on the dashboard and 250-300 beds from all the categories will be available. Amongst those almost 10-15 will be ICU beds.” PMC has asked private hospitals to reserve 80 per cent of beds for Covid patients, but in the light of the increasing caseload the number of beds is insufficient. Experts pointed out that the ICU beds need special arrangements and trained staff and it is not something which can be increased as per requirement. “We are getting continuous calls from patients and mostly for ICU beds. Once a patient is put on a ventilator, in my observation, s/he requires at least a week to recover. So, if already all the beds are full, how can new patients be admitted? Currently we are making Covid patients sign a consent form before getting admitted that they may not get ICU beds if their condition deteriorates. There is a difference between an oxygen bed and an ICU bed. The latter cannot be increased overnight,” said Dr Sanjay Lalwani, medical director at Bharati Vidyapeeth medical college, hospital and research centre. “Breaking the chain and keeping ourselves and our families safe is the only key. Each and every citizen should do that,” said Rao.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/ventilator-bed-shortage-experts-say-requirement-too-high-than-availability-in-pune-101617632594327.html

Deshmukh, also an NCP leader, resigned over allegations of corruption levelled against him by former Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh.In the resignation letter sent to Thackeray, Deshmukh said he doesn't find it morally correct to continue as the home minister after the order of Bombay high court, which earlier on Monday ordered the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to conduct a preliminary investigation against him.The high court observed that there can no independent probe into the allegations of corruption against Deshmukh if the investigation is handed to Mumbai Police, which is headed by the state home minister. The court order came on a petition by Singh and others which claimed that Deshmukh was running an "extortion racket". Singh's accusations came after he was transferred to the Home Guards for improper handling of the Ambani bomb scare case. Singh alleged that the former state home minister Anil Deshmukh appointed suspended cop Sachin Vaze to collect ₹100 crore every month from various establishments in Mumbai.The claims were first made by Singh in a letter to Thackeray. He also approached the Supreme Court, which directed Singh to move the high court against Deshmukh.After the Bombay High Court's order, a meeting was held between the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar and deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar at Sharad Pawar's residence Silver Oak in south Mumbai where the issue was discussed in detail. State rural development minister Hassan Mushrif will be taking over the labour portfolio while deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar will take over the excise department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maha-cm-accepts-deshmukh-s-resignation-dilip-walse-patil-takes-charge-101617630315668.html

State health department has asked AIIMS to increase the number of Covid-19 beds due to the sudden spike in Covid-19 cases.“We are not able to accommodate any Covid-19 patients for the last three days as all our beds are full. Ninety-five beds for Covid-19 patients in our institute were occupied till yesterday. We are increasing the number of beds to 110, following the state health department’s request,” said Dr Sanjeev Kumar, nodal officer for Covid-19 at AIIMS-Patna told HT.AIIMS had reduced the number of beds designated for Covid-19 patients to 40, out of which 20 beds were reserved in the Intensive Care Unit and 20 in wards. The state government had directed AIIMS authorities to increase the number of Covid-19 designated beds as cases started peaking after Holi.“We are adding 10 beds to the existing 20 in the ICU for Covid-19 patients. The remaining 80 beds will be in wards. We cannot increase any further beds at this point of time because we also need to cater to non-Covid patients, who are admitted at our hospital,” added Dr Kumar.The spike in cases has caused the state’s recovery rate to dip from 99 per cent to 98.31 per cent.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/covid19-bihar-witnesses-spike-in-cases-patna-emerges-as-hotspot-101617628070719.html

05-04-2021||Delhi||Rising Covid cases: Delhi health min urges recovered persons to donate plasma||With cases of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) on the rise, the Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain on Monday urged people who have recently recovered from the infection to donate plasma. He said that the donations dropped over the last two months as there were very few eligible donors owing to the low infection rate. “I will appeal all those who have recovered from Covid-19 now to donate their plasma. What has happened is that there were very few cases over the last two to three months the number of cases were very low, meaning there were very few eligible donors. In the last fifteen days, the number of cases has gone up drastically,” said Jain in a press briefing. Convalescent plasma therapy uses a blood component called plasma that is rich in virus-fighting antibodies from a recovered patient to aid the immune response in patients with current infection. Scientists still do not agree on whether the therapy actually helps Covid-19 patients. Also Read | PM Narendra Modi to interact with CMs on current Covid-19 situation on April 8A study by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) found that the treatment was not associated with any reduction in mortality or progression to severe disease. On the contrary, a study by Delhi’s Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences found that plasma therapy helped stabilise the respiratory rate, improve oxygen saturation, and improve the organ failure score that predicts multi-organ failure. Separately, a study by the US healthcare centre Mayo Clinic found that the seven-day mortality rate went down in patients given therapy within three days of diagnosis as compared with patients transfused four or more days after diagnosis. The Delhi government was the first to open a plasma bank in the country and had said that the therapy was one of the five “weapons” it had against the viral infection. Talking about the increasing number of cases in the city, Jain said, “From what the experts say, this time around the infection is spreading faster but there are fewer deaths. To control the spread, we have ramped up testing to between 80 and 90 thousand each day, we are tracing 20 to 30 contacts for each positive case and quarantining them. And, we are creating micro containment zones,” said Jain. The fourth Covid-19 wave continued to expand its footprint in the Capital, with Delhi adding 4,033 new infections on Sunday, the largest one-day spike in 121 days, even as the disease claimed 21 more lives — the most since January 1 this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/rising-covid-cases-delhi-health-min-urges-recovered-persons-to-donate-plasma-101617626654704.html

Pune Cantonment Board (PCB) elected member Vinod Mathurawala has requested the district administration to seek additional beds for civilians at the hospital.AICTS was converted into a Covid hospital chiefly for the treatment of service personnel, ex-servicemen, and their wards from March 29 last year. The hospital converted its 600-bed facility into a 400-bed Covid-19 facility, with 20 critical beds (ventilators), 30 intensive care unit (ICU) beds and 350 isolation beds. The institute has treated several Covid patients not only from the armed forces fraternity, but also civilians. More than 322 civilian patients requiring critical care were admitted since September last year and 55 police personnel have been treated in the ICU and discharged.Mathurawala said, “Only confirmed cases of Covid from Pune Cantonment can be admitted in the said facility,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pune-collector-seeks-military-assistance-for-additional-covid-patient-beds-101617626593989.html

An FIR of forgery has already been registered at Kotwali police station against one Dr Alka Ray. The ambulance was found to have been registered in her name using fake documents,” said Yamuna Prasad, SP (Barabanki).The said FIR was lodged against Dr Alka Rai on the complaint of Regional Transport Officer officials in Barabanki. A team of Barabanki police interrogated Ray in Mau district on Sunday. Dr Ray said she informed police that she had no connection with Barabanki and had never set up any hospital in Barabanki. She claimed to have no idea how the ambulance was registered in her name in Barabanki. The team examined her signatures and matched them with those on the registration documents of the ambulance. On the other hand, the Barabanki police officials continued to investigate the matter. On Monday, they questioned five people in the city known to be close aides of Mukhtar Ansari. “Five people, who are known accomplices of Mukhtar Ansari, were brought in for questioning regarding the ambulance. They were asked about their links with Ansari and their possible involvement in arranging the ambulance. They were asked to leave after questioning but have been asked to report to the police station for further questioning when required,” said the SP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ambulance-used-by-mukhtar-to-be-brought-to-up-s-barabanki-from-punjab-101617625093989.html

05-04-2021||Pune||Monday musings: No beds in Pune, fear stalks the streets||Summer is here and so are the restrictions. Covid numbers are showing a massive spike every passing day in Pune, and in parts of Maharashtra. The second wave has set in amid anxious worries about how far it will go.The dashboard prepared by city administration showed on Sunday morning there are no ICU beds available in Pune. The situation is a chilling reminder of August last year, when many died in the absence of oxygen support or access to ventilators. The Jumbo Covid unit restarted by state government has also been completely occupied and people are scrambling for beds. It’s been more than a year since Pune saw Maharashtra’s first case. Prior to the pandemic, PMC hospitals in the city did not even have a single operating ventilator. Did the local and state authorities ramp up health infrastructure in the past one year?Among the few things the Pune Municipal Corporation did was to convert its Baner facility into a 300-bed hospital, using Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) measures. The facility currently has 312 beds for critical care, including 270 oxygenated beds, 26 ICU beds and 16 ventilators. The hospital is currently dedicated for Covid-19 patients, but will eventually be opened for other ailments once the pandemic comes to an end. Besides Baner, the state government created a Jumbo facility, which had to be closed in Decembe,r and resurrected by March whenCovid numbers began to surge. One of the oldest medical facilities, Sassoon General Hospital, also saw a major upgrade after 11 years. On the whole though, neither PMC, nor the district administration utilised the past year to permanently create some robust health infrastructure that will last for years to come. In fact, around 42 per cent of the operational ventilators under new additions in most of the public hospitals in Pune and a few private hospitals were donated by the Pune Platform for Covid Response (PPCR), created by industry body MCCIA. Through donations from corporates, PPCR donated 263 ventilators and 107 High Flow Nasal Oxygen units to various hospitals in Pune.All this help is very useful, but not adequate to tackle a pandemic such as this, when the daily caseload of Pune district on Saturday went up to 10,800; a scary figure. When cases are rising substantially and health infrastructure is falling short, many countries have opted during the past one year to stop the movement of people. Curbs have its cost, but benefits may overweigh these, provided the government takes a humanitarian approach and offer financial assistance.During the period of restrictions when people’s movement is affected, rigorous testing and tracing of contacts has shown that the surge can be controlled effectively. During the last week of February and early days of March, two districts of Maharashtra – Amravati and Yavatmal – startled everyone when the positivity rate reached around 50%. Families after families tested positive in these two cities as the virus had penetrated most localities. The authorities then started testing all possible close contacts to trace infected people. By March third week, the positivity rate of Amravati and Yavatmal came down to at 12% and 9%, respectively, and by April, it showed a further dip. In Pune, the positivity rate during the past week crossed 32 %. On Saturday, it touched 34.70 %. Despite the high rate, sample testing hasn’t increased as much as it should have, neither has contact tracing happening on a mass level. Most housing societies declared as micro-containment zones have been failing to strictly follow Covid-appropriate behaviour. If people are not following norms, the government has little choice, but to go for restrictions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/monday-musings-no-beds-in-pune-fear-stalks-the-streets-101617620534705.html

The amount exported is higher than the number of vaccine doses given to the people in India. Should we care about people from our own country or from other countries?" Chadha said."Where has the Centre's vaccine nationalism gone? The AAP demands an increase in the rate of vaccinations against Covid-19 so that each and every Indian can get vaccinated," he said.He further claimed that it will take 15 years to vaccinate the entire population of India if vaccination drive continues at the current pace."Some scientists say that to contain the virus at least 70 percent of the population has to be vaccinated.

States never faced such problems earlier, he said, claiming that the Centre was trying to destroy existing relations and systems that had worked well for more than a century in the name of so-called reforms, which it was trying to impose without taking the stakeholders into confidence. Also read: Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh, facing corruption allegations, resignsPunjab’s farmers and arhtiyas (commission agents) have age-old cordial ties, which the Centre is bent on damaging, he said, saying its tough posturing is against the spirit of federalism. He said during his earlier tenures, he enjoyed the confidence and support of former Prime Ministers Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Manmohan Singh in all major policy decisions related to Punjab. Launches Kisan Mela at PAU, Ludhiana Virtually launching the two-day Kisan Mela at Punjab Agricultural University (PAU), Ludhiana, the chief minister said: “Had the Centre been sincere about a workable solution, it would have either consulted the Punjab government or the farmers, as the state alone contributes over 40% of foodgrains to the national pool.” The chief minister said that Punjab, which was initially not even a part of the deliberations on agricultural reforms, was included in the high-powered committee only after he wrote to the Centre. Resultantly, state finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal and the then secretary, agriculture, KS Pannu attended the two meetings held thereafter but there was no mention of the farm laws, he said. Pointing out that 144 farmers have died so far during their agitation, he said his government was giving ₹5 lakh and a job to kin of the deceased farmer, while the Centre continued to be insensitive. Urges farmers to adopt drip irrigation On the growing scarcity of surface and ground water, the chief minister urged the farmers to go for drip irrigation to save the state from becoming a desert in the near future. The depleting water table, resulting from melting glaciers, is a challenge for the state and the only solution is to get out of the paddy-wheat cycle to save this resource, he said. He asked farmers to make optimum use of drip irrigation, besides switching over to less water consuming crops such as vegetables and fruits. He urged farmers to make minimum use of pesticides and insecticides according to the recommendations of PAU experts as their reckless overuse is not only a health hazard but also leads to mass scale rejection of foodgrains, especially basmati rice, financially hitting farmers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/centre-trying-to-dominate-with-farm-laws-dbt-punjab-cm-101617617114239.html

05-04-2021||Delhi||Summer wrath ahead: Donate water bottles, ORS, towels to the needy||The weather experts are expecting one of the harshest summer seasons this year. Last Monday, on Holi, Delhi experienced the hottest day in March in 76 years, as per the India Meteorological Department, and was reeling under a “severe” heatwave on the day of Holi when the maximum temperature shot up to 40.1 degree Celsius! The worrisome bit is that this heat wave can cause severe dehydration, especially to those homeless who are out on the streets. Keeping this in mind, several non profit organisations across Delhi-NCR are doing their bit to ensure help is provided to the needy. From shelter and food to water and towels, they are collecting and donating it all, and here’s how you too can join in the noble cause. You could donate these:After battling the cruel winter, harsh summer is set to present another set of challenges to the homeless, who are already finding it difficult to seek shade in shelters due to the Covid protocols that require social distancing. Those out under the sun, are prone to health risks such as dehydration, heat stroke and exhaustion. To provide for those homeless who are looking for a shelter from the scorching heat, Ravi Kalra, founder, The Earth Saviours Foundation, says, “We are in the process to accommodate 2,000 abandoned senior citizens and homeless mentally disabled people at our NGO’s new upcoming shelter home located at Mandawar Village in Gurugram. We work with the police and courts to rescue people from the roads.” Rahul Verma, founder, Uday Foundation, says, “We believe that providing mere basic health care is not enough, as every individual also deserves dignity. So, we ensure the same by providing them respect, human touch, basic health care, free food and dry ration through an empathetic approach. Throughout the year we run our share and care campaign, where we provide help in-kind to the homeless and underprivileged patients in government hospitals, and people who are living in open on the streets and at shelters during the night. We distribute them among other necessities, packed water bottles, ORS, glucose and juices during the summer months in Delhi and other major parts of northern India with the support of our volunteers, corporate and individual donors. Online stores can give options to a donor to purchase an item and donate the same to us directly through the website or app.” For the hot and dehydrating days, along with food packets, Roti Bank and its volunteers are distributing water bottles to the needy. “The volunteers recycle the empty fizzy drink pet bottles and fill them with fresh water from the RO water filters at their homes, and distribute them along with food. These days can be extremely challenging and fresh water is not easy to find for the homeless. Some even fall sick due to dehydration. We wouldn’t want the homeless to consume drainage water and harm their health. Our aim is to stop that. Apart from that we’re also giving them hand towels for hygiene purposes,” says Sudhir Behrani, founder of the NGO.And the Robin Hood Army is focusing not only to ensure that those on the streets don’t go empty stomach, but also get nourished with knowledge, and are therefore facilitating education for the street children. Continuing to serve meals to those who need it the most, Neel Ghose, founder of the organisation, says, “We are currently serving 1.1 million meals per month across 217 cities, and we hope to scale that significantly. With the vaccine mobilisation spreading, we hope to ramp up enabling street children being enrolled in schools through our education initiative, the Robin Hood Academy.” Author tweets @Nainaarora8Follow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/summer-wrath-ahead-donate-water-bottles-ors-towels-to-the-needy-101617613878737.html
05-04-2021||Delhi||Lend the warmth of your heart to keep strays cool this summer||In this heat when temperature is already making new records, even before we hit the peak May-June, even humans are finding it difficult to get access to both shade and succour and can feel wilted at times. Then, imagine how tough it would be for the stray animals and birds, who have no recourse from the wrath of Sun god! But, there are ways to ensure that our furry and feathered friends make it through the season with ease, if only each one of us becomes a little mindful.A water bowl in the house costs nothingAnimals get dehydrated quite easily when it’s too hot. So, water bowls are an effective solution to help them survive the harsh heat. Shruti Kapoor, a Delhiite, who has been keeping water bowls for stray dogs across the city, says, “I’ve placed water bowls at more than 100 locations in Delhi. At some places, I’ve to go and refill it everyday whereas at others, there are some kind people who help refill them. In fact, you could make a water bowl for the strays out of any kitchen utensil, but terracotta pots are the best since they keep the water cool for longer duration.”Seema Asthana, a resident of Delhi’s RK Puram, has kept water baths for birds to drink and bathe in, since the heat became unbearable. She says, “The most important idea is to keep the bowl at an elevated spot so that the birds are safe from stray animals, who might be on the prowl. Also, refilling the bowl regularly, and cleaning it once in two days will make sure that no infections get transmitted from one sick bird to another.” Some shade from the sunStray dogs are prone to get a heat stroke since they are out on the streets most of the time. To avoid the heat from taking a toll on stray dogs, Sumit Singla, a member of Paws for a Cause, an animal welfare initiative, says, “One can create makeshift dog houses using cartons, cardboard pieces and even plastic sheds that provide respite from the sun. Dogs and cats sometimes take shelter under parked vehicles, which makes it important for us to check properly before you start driving your vehicle so that you don’t end up injuring or killing them.”Watermelon and cucumber in diet Animals need the right nutrition to battle heat. Therefore, fruits are a good source of nutrition. “Watermelon, muskmelon, cucumber and other hydrating fruits can help restore their lost energy due to the heat,” says Singla, adding how summer can bring with it varied health issues for strays, including ticks: “Ticks and worms can overload the already loaded immune systems of animals. Regularly de-tick and deworm them, ensuring to not overdose on medication.” Cooler in guard houses, could cool strays Priya Chopra, a resident of Safdarjung, Delhi, is prepping to organise a drive in the city to provide water to strays including cows, and raise awareness for the cause. “I have booked a water tanker, and will go to isolated spots in the city where animals are neglected and have no access to food or water. Cows and dogs roam on the streets all day in the burning heat. I plan to speak to the residents in these areas to replenish their water bowls on a daily basis,” she says, adding, “I have asked people in my society to make sure that the stray dogs are allowed to sit in front of the cooler, which is provided in various guard rooms of the houses.” Author tweets @bhagat_mallikaFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/lend-the-warmth-of-your-heart-to-keep-strays-cool-this-summer-101617613049919.html

05-04-2021||Mumbai||Bombay HC orders preliminary CBI probe into charges against Anil Deshmukh||The Bombay high court has directed the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to conduct a preliminary investigation into the allegations of corruption made by former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh against Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh within 15 days. On completion of the preliminary inquiry, the court has left it to the discretion of the director of CBI to decide the further course of action.The order was passed on the public interest litigations (PILs) filed by Singh, lawyer Ghanshyam Upadhyay, CA Mohan Bhide and a petition by lawyer Dr Jaishri Patil. The division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni, while passing the order on Monday, held that directions were required in Dr Jaishri Patil’s petition to order an unbiased probe to unearth the truth. The court observed that there could not be an independent probe if it was given to police as Deshmukh is the home minister and said the interest of justice would be served if the CBI was allowed to conduct a preliminary inquiry. “Such preliminary inquiry be conducted in accordance with law and be concluded within 15 days. Once preliminary inquiry is complete, it will be at the discretion of the director of CBI to decide on further course of action,” observed the bench. The court, however, held that the CBI may not register an FIR based on the complaint by Dr Patil till then. Also Read | A month later, 9 unanswered questions in the Antilia-Hiran-Vaze caseSingh had approached the high court after the Supreme Court rejected his civil writ petition but granted him liberty to approach the high court. Singh filed a criminal PIL on March 25 seeking a CBI probe into the alleged malpractices by Deshmukh. The bench conducted a marathon hearing that lasted over six hours on Wednesday, March 31, wherein it heard not only Singh’s PIL but also two other PILs seeking similar action against Deshmukh as well as against Singh. The bench also heard Dr Patil’s petition. She sought an independent inquiry as well as directions to the Malabar Hill police station to register an FIR against Deshmukh. Dr Patil approached the high court after the Malabar Hill police station did not take action on a letter she had written on March 21 seeking registration of a complaint against Deshmukh. The state had opposed Singh’s PIL on the grounds that his allegations were made after his transfer order was passed on March 17, which indicated that the PIL was a personal vendetta against Deshmukh. Advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni had further submitted that the allegations that police officers were directed by Deshmukh to indulge in extortion were not substantiated by the officers through any statement or affidavit and hence Singh’s claims could be construed as hearsay and the PIL was not maintainable. Singh’s complaint regarding Rashmi Shukla was also refuted by the state. The Maharashtra government’s senior counsel Ashutosh Kumbhakoni submitted that a high-level inquiry was conducted in September last year by the highest authorities, and after it was found that there had been no transfers or postings in that period, the inquiry was closed.Kumbhakoni submitted that Patil’s letter to Malabar hill police station required an inquiry which is permitted for 15 days upto six weeks under the Code of Criminal Procedure, hence seekinga transfer of investigation to CBI would not be valid before the police have an opportunity to inquire into the issue. After hearing the submissions, the bench observed that prima facie, Singh’s PIL was not maintainable as no FIR was registered. The court said that the basic premise of transferring an investigation could be held when an investigation was underway, however, in the absence of any FIR, as no investigation was going on, the court could not pass orders for transfer. The court asked Singh as to why he had not registered an FIR against the home minister when he saw an offence being committed. The court also asked Singh why he had not exhausted his remedy of filing an FIR against Deshmukh by approaching the magistrate before approaching the court. On Monday, while passing its judgement, the court observed that the high-level committee ordered by the state through a government notification led it to believe that there was no need for interference. It, however, held that it found substance in the arguments of Singh’s counsel, senior advocate Vikram Nankani and Upadhyay’s advocate Subhash Jha that it was an unprecedented case and as Deshmukh was the home minister and led the police, an independent investigation was required. The court then directed the CBI to conduct a preliminary inquiry and conclude it within 15 days but restrained it from registering an FIR immediately or to take up Patil’s complaint. Thereafter the court observed that it was conscious that it had reserved its order on March 31 on the aspect of admissibility, however, in light of ts new order, the concerns raised in the petitions did not survive and hence they were being disposed of. The court also observed that Singh was at liberty to submit his grievance, if any, before an appropriate forum. After the high court passed its order, Bharatiya Janata Party leader Atul Bhatkhalkar said the party welcomed the ruling “In the light of the high court’s ruling, the home minister himself should resign from the post. If he fails to do so, it is the duty of the chief minister to sack him from the post. The political leaders involved in the scam of transfer of police officers and the alleged ‘extortion racket’ should be punished,” he said.Leader of Opposition and former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis demanded Deshmukh’s resignation. “The CBI inquiry has been directed after the Bombay high court felt that the Mumbai Police failed to take a complaint into allegations by the former Mumbai Police commissioner. The CBI will now probe into the allegations of extortion and the involvement of the ministers and other heavyweight leaders of ruling parties. Taking moral responsibility, Deshmukh should resign. If he fails to do so, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray should sack him,” he said. Fadnavis added that it was unfortunate that the chief minister was conspicuously silent days after the “very serious allegations” came to the light. Maharashtra Congress’ general secretary and spokesperson Sachin Sawant said the verdict set an unfortunate precedent. “The intention of former Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh was malafide while levelling allegations against the home minister. This has been stated by Bombay high court too in its observation. The officer was duty-bound to take action against the alleged corruption when it was revealed to him by his subordinates, instead, he chose to remain silent. The orders of preliminary inquiry by the CBI is uncalled for as the state government has already constituted a panel to probe the entire case.”The Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) said that they were open to an investigation into the allegations against Deshmukh and a probe by a retired high court judge was already underway. Deshmukh is an NCP leader. “The NCP or Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi [the Maharashtra government] has never denied any investigation into the allegations. In fact, the state government has already instituted an inquiry by a retired high court judge, which was upheld by the Bombay high court. The court said since the inquiry is already being conducted, the CBI need not register an FIR and is free to conduct a preliminary inquiry. After completing the course of preliminary probe, the CBI can take appropriate action,” said NCP spokesperson Mahesh Tapase. Over the issue of Deshmukh’s resignation, he said they are waiting for a copy of the court’s judgement. “The entire issue will now be discussed by the party high command and an appropriate decision will be taken,” Tapase said.The Shiv Sena elected to not respond to the court order for the time being. “The government will study what the high court has said in its order,”said Sena spokesperson Sanjay Raut||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-orders-preliminary-cbi-probe-into-charges-against-anil-deshmukh-101617608233853.html

Educational institutions were reopened in January this year after nearly a year long closure due to pandemic outbreak in March 2020.Bishop Scott Group of schools held an online meeting with staff members to formulate plans for resumption of online classes starting from Monday.

As there is uncertainty about the reopening of educational institutions, it is best to continue academic activities digitally.”However, teachers said they needed to prepare for online classes, which they said was a tiring job. Aradhana Singh, a TGT teacher, said, “We need to prepare study materials and videos on the specific topic for online classes, which takes around three to four hours.”Bihar Public School and Children Welfare Association has asked the state government to provide data regarding Covid-19 transmission in private schools. Association’s chairman DK Singh, said, “Private schools were operating regular classes following Covid-19 safety protocols. Sudden closure of schools has left school operators hassled.

05-04-2021||Mumbai||A month later, 9 unanswered questions in the Antilia-Hiran-Vaze case||It has been 37 days since a Mahindra Scorpio was found abandoned near the residence of industrialist Mukesh Ambani on Carmichael Road in Mumbai with 20 loose gelatin sticks and a threatening letter addressed to the Ambanis.April 5 also marks a month since the body of auto parts dealer linked to the Scorpio, Mansukh Hiran, washed up ashore the Reti Bunder creek in Thane district.Two investigation agencies have worked on both cases; the National Investigation Agency (NIA) took over both probes from the Maharashtra Anti-Terrorism Squad last month, following orders from the Union home ministry. Sachin Vaze, a Mumbai cop, has been named as prime suspect in both cases, and two men have been arrested for Hiran’s murder. Several people have been questioned over the weeks, and the investigation is still ongoing as new evidence is unearthed.Here are nine questions pertaining to the two interlinked cases that still remain a mystery.1. Why was the SUV abandoned near Ambani residence, Antilia? Senior NIA officials believe that Vaze, the former head of the Crime Intelligence Unit (CIU) of the Mumbai Crime Branch and the first lead investigator of the case, orchestrated the security scare outside billionaire industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s house, as a ploy to restore his reputation as a successful cop and regain lost glory. “He wanted to prove to Mumbai Police brass that he is still as good by solving a bomb conspiracy so he planned this whole episode to plant explosives outside Antilia. He wanted the limelight again,” a Delhi-based NIA officer has said.Also Watch | Sachin Vaze’s brother reacts to NIA custody extensionHowever, it still unclear as to why the Ambanis were targeted at all — from the car being parked outside the road across Antilia, to the threatening note to the industrialist, to the fact that the vehicle bore the number plates of Ambani’s security detail. The explosives were not assembled into a bomb, nor was a detonator or a timer found in the vehicle. Meanwhile, Vaze has denied his role in this case.2. Did suspended Mumbai police officer Sachin Vaze work alone in allegedly planning the security scare? The NIA has questioned several persons and recorded the statements of about 35 witnesses in connection with the Antilia security scare case, but the agency has only arrested one person so far: Vaze. However, on February 26, a Telegram channel was created by “jaishulhind” [Jaish-ul-Hind] and a message claiming responsibility for parking the vehicle outside Antilia was posted from that channel. A message seeking payment in bitcoin, a crypto currency, was also sent out on this channel, which reportedly had 10 members. The identity of the members is not immediately known as the maker of the channel closed the group the following day.During the course of their investigation, the NIA discovered the Telegram message and traced it to the Tihar jail. The jail authorities also questioned an inmate, Tehsin Akhtar, the last known chief of the now dormant home-grown terror outfit Indian Mujahideen (IM), after two smart phones were recovered from his barrack in Tihar’s jail number 8, one of which reportedly sent out the message. However, officials are sceptical about this so-called terror outfit, and say that it’s unlikely such a group exists.3. Where were the 20 sticks of gelatin procured from? Gelatin sticks are cheap explosive material used typically in quarries and can be stored easily. They cannot explode without a detonator and are easily available in the grey market. It is, however, not clear as to where the 20 loose gelatin sticks found in the green Scorpio were procured from. The gelatin sticks found in the SUV were manufactured by Solar Industries Limited, Nagpur, a leading manufacturer of commercial explosives. The manufacturing, sale and use of gelatin is regulated under provisions of the Explosives Act, but the regulations are not strictly implemented. However, it’s still unclear where these sticks were bought, when and by whom.4. Why was Mansukh Hiran murdered? This crucial question still remains unanswered almost a month after the 48-year-old businessman’s death. Hiran knew Vaze for years; according to his wife’s statement to the ATS, Vaze had even borrowed the Scorpio from Hiran for four months and returned it to him on February 5. Hiran’s older brother, Vinod, was in touch with Vaze on the night Hiran went missing after leaving his home at 8.30pm.Officials speaking on condition of anonymity said that one likely reason was that Hiran may have known too much of the accused in the explosives case. That explains why none of his belongings were found on him when his body was recovered from the creek.5. Where are Hiran’s belongings? When Hiran’s body was recovered from the creek in Thane district, his face was masked and his mouth had several handkerchiefs stuffed inside it. All his personal effects, including a gold ring, a wristwatch, a wallet, and the mobile phone — which he had on him when he left home at 8.30pm on March 4, according to wife Vimla’s statement to the police — were missing. The investigators have searched several places, including a godown allegedly belonging to Vaze located at Majiwade junction, as well as the houses of Shinde in Kalwa. Even Vaze’s house in Thane’s Saket Complex, has been searched a few times. However, Hiran’s belongings are not reported to have been recovered as yet.6. Why did Hiran meet Vaze on February 17?Based on the statement that Vimla, Hiran’s wife, gave to the ATS, we know that Hiran had taken the Scorpio on February 17 because he had some business in south Mumbai. We also know that Hiran left the car on the side of the road at Vikhroli, because the steering jammed. He then hailed a private taxi and went towards his destination.According to CCTV camera footage captured outside the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (CSMT), Hiran met Vaze outside the Crime Intelligence Unit office; the two sat in Vaze’s Mercedes for a short while, and then Hiran left. The following day, according to Vimla’s statement, Hiran reportedly went to the site where he had left the Scorpio and finding it missing, registered a stolen vehicle report. What did the two talk about in the car?7. Who is the woman discovered in the CCTV footage of Trident hotel where Vaze stayed in February 2021? The NIA has recovered a CCTV grab from Trident hotel, where Vaze stayed in February 2021, capturing a woman in her early 30s speaking to Vaze in the hotel corridor and carrying a currency notes counting machine in her hand. Another grab showed the woman leaving the hotel the next morning. NIA traced the woman and recorded her statement. Her identity is still a mystery.8 Was the stolen Maruti Eco involved in the entire episode? On March 28, the NIA recovered from Mithi river one laptop, one printer, two hard discs, two Central Processing Units, two Digital Video Recorders etc. which were allegedly damaged and thrown in the river. Besides this rich evidentiary haul, the federal agency also recovered a set of number plates of a Maruti Eco that was stolen from Aurangabad in November 2020. The vehicle was owned by Vinay Nade, who reported the vehicle stolen from Aurangabad on November 20, 2020. The question still remains: did the vehicle have anything to do with this crime?9. Do former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh’s allegations regarding the Home Minister and Sachin Vaze have any bearing on the case? On March 20, Singh, who had recently been transferred out of his post, wrote a letter to the chief minister alleging that Anil Deshmukh, the state’s home minister, had set a target for certain police officers, including Vaze, to collect ₹100 crore from bars, restaurants, and other establishments in the city. Deshmukh denied these allegations and said that the investigators had probably come close to unearthing Singh’s role in the Antilia scare conspiracy.A one-person committee to be headed by retired justice KU Chandiwal has been constituted to probe Singh’s allegations. The Opposition Bharatiya Janata Party alleged that senior politicians were protecting Vaze; but CM Uddhav Thackeray has said that the probe by investigation agencies will reveal the truth and no guilty party will be spared.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/a-month-later-nine-unanswered-questions-in-the-antilia-hiran-vaze-case-101617595513397.html
05-04-2021||Mumbai||Bombay HC to pronounce order on PIL filed by Param Bir Singh today||The Bombay high court is scheduled to pronounce its order on a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh, seeking a Central Bureau of Information (CBI) probe in his allegations of corruption against home minister Anil Deshmukh.A bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni is expected to pronounce the order at 11am.The PIL called for the report of Commissioner of Intelligence Rashmi Shukla and all connected files to be placed before the high court. Meanwhile, an advocate Ghanshyam Upadhyay also filed a PIL seeking a court-monitored probe by the CBI or ED into the various alleged malpractices by police officers including Singh and suspended API Sachin Vaze, and home minister Deshmukh. The petition will come up for hearing in due course. Also Read | NCP men in Maharashtra home dept and their tryst with controversyThe PIL filed by Singh through advocate Akshay Bafana alleged that Deshmukh called now-suspended API Sachin Vaze to his residence and told him that he had a target of ₹100 crore to collect per month. The PIL also alleged that a few days later Deshmukh called ACP Sanjay Patil of the Social Services branch of the Mumbai Police and discussed hookah parlours in the city, and also instructed other officers to conduct investigations into various crimes “as per his whims”. Singh’s PIL stated that he had written to the chief minister and other leaders and apprised them of Deshmukh’s meetings with the police officers and interference in the functioning of the police force but rather than taking action against Deshmukh, a March 17 order of the home department transferred him to the Home Guards. The PIL also pointed to the unceremonious transfer of Shukla after she reported the interference by Deshmukh in matters pertaining to postings and transfers in Maharashtra to the Director General of Police who in turn informed the additional chief secretary home department. In light of this, the PIL sought an urgent, independent, unbiased, uninfluenced, impartial and fair investigation in the various corrupt malpractices of Deshmukh by the CBI among other prayers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-to-pronounce-order-on-pil-filed-by-param-bir-singh-today-101617594013304.html

He tagged the tweet to the chief minister.Patna is a major Covid-19 hotspot in the state with 1,254 active cases in total. The capital city reported the highest number- 372 positive cases. Total active cases in Bihar have shot up to 3,560, according to official data.“BPSC’s stubborn attitude will make us fall prey to Covid. Keeping in consideration the increase in cases, the commission should delay the examination for now,” said another candidate Ajay Trivedi.Another aspirant detailed out why holding the examinations as per schedule could pose grave risk to examinees. “The BJS exam takes place in two shifts, which is almost six hours a day. We have to be outside (our homes) from morning to evening in a situation when Covid cases are rising rapidly. It is not safe to travel to Patna and stay in a hotel for the duration of the exam and eat outside food,” said Ashish Sharma.Following the flood of requests, an update announcing postponement of the examination was uploaded on the BPSC’s official website. The new date for the examination will be announced later, said the notice dated April 4.Some students, however, expressed unhappiness over the postponement, calling it a wastage of time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-judicial-services-exam-postponed-following-covid-19-resurgence-in-patna-101617592933316.html

05-04-2021||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh revamps Covid-19 containment zone strategy. Details here||With daily cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) rising in Uttar Pradesh, the state government has revamped the scope of what would constitute a containment zone, Hindustan Times’ sister publication Live Hindustan has reported.According to orders issued by chief secretary Rajendra Kumar Tiwari, a 25-metre containment zone would be set up if one positive Covid-19 case is detected, while a 50-metre containment zone would be established if more than one positive case is found. Twenty houses would fall within the 25-metre containment zone and the corresponding figure is 60 for the 50-metre one, the order says.The order also says that an area would remain a containment zone for 14 days from the date of sample collection of the last positive case of the viral disease. If no fresh infection is found for 14 days from the date of sample collection of the last positive case, that area would be delisted as a containment zone. For multi-storeyed buildings, the floor on which the positive case of the coronavirus disease has been found will be declared a containment zone. The district surveillance officer is required to inform the district immunisation officer about daily new cases in a containment zone.In case of more than one positive case of the coronavirus disease in the area, it would be considered as a cluster. Marking its central point as the epicentre, a containment zone would be set up over a 50-metre radius. Teams would be deployed to inspect houses within each containment zone; each team would visit the houses in the area assigned to them and prepare a work report on the prescribed form. A health worker, a village development panchayati raj worker and a member of the local administration would comprise each team. They would conduct a door-to-door visit of houses in their respective areas and inform people of the symptoms of Covid-19, and ways to avoid contracting the disease.Uttar Pradesh reported 4,614 fresh cases and 31 related fatalities on Sunday, according to the state's health department. This is the highest death toll in the state this year and also the first time since October 2020 that there were more than 30 deaths in a single day. On October 15 last year, 36 people succumbed to the disease.The northern state’s Covid-19 tally and death toll are at 630,059 and 8,881 respectively.

05-04-2021||Delhi||Sunday slots draw people to Covid-19 jab centres||Over 59,000 people turned up to take Covid-19 vaccine shots on April 4 (till 6 pm), the first Sunday when jabs were administered in the city, as the expanded vaccination drive and the Centre’s orders to states to keep sites open on all days, helped push up the Capital’s inoculations. Several residents said the weekend was a more suitable time to take the doses than working days.Of the 59,125 jabs administered on Sunday, 56,074 were first doses, said provisional data released by the Delhi government. The vaccination drive was opened up for all individuals aged above 45 on April 1, after which vaccination numbers in the Capital increased consistently.On Saturday, 80,797 people were vaccinated till 6pm as against 52,408 on Friday and 71,284 on Thursday, government data showed.Sunday got off to a good start, with several sites in the city pre-booked between 9am and 3pm. During a spot check on Sunday, HT spoke to multiple employees of different private companies, businesspersons, and industrial workers, among others, who said they came to get the vaccine after booking slots for Sunday in advance.The Capital currently has 739 vaccination centres that operate from 9am to 9pm. Between 9am and 3pm, people who book slots in advance through portals such as Aarogya Setu are given preference. Vaccination sites keep around 100 slots reserved for these six hours. After 3pm, all sites open up for on-the-spot registrations and vaccinations.“The work schedule is hectic during this time of the year, and it is nearly impossible to think of taking the vaccine on a working day. And what if it leads to a mild fever for a day? Keeping the drive open on Sundays is a major relief,” said Akash Mishra, an accounts manager with an audit company based in Delhi, who took the vaccine at a site in east Delhi’s Mayur Vihar 1 on Sunday.“I booked a slot for Sunday on Thursday. I knew that a lot of people would come for the vaccine on Sunday and the nearest site could run out of doses for the day. If missed, my slot would probably get delayed by a week. Weekdays are very hectic,” said Manav Baweja, a businessman who took the shot at a site in south-east Delhi’s Lajpat Nagar on Sunday.Ramdeen Prajapati, an industrial worker, said Sunday was the only day he could make time to take the jab.“Our work involves loading and unloading heavy machinery. It is not possible to accommodate work and taking the vaccine on the same day. Skipping a day’s work will mean forgoing wages, which people like us cannot afford, especially in the current tough times. Sunday is the only option I have,” said Prajapati, who took the shot at a dispensary near west Delhi’s Mayapuri on Sunday.The Delhi government is also identifying schools and community centres where new vaccine sites can be set up. Currently, all such sites in the city are in health care facilities.“We have sought the central government’s opinion on the matter. If approved, these centres will be Delhi’s first set of outreach vaccination sites,” said a senior government official who asked not to be named.Officials said one of the main challenges is to vaccinate residents of unauthorised colonies and slums, a large number of which are located in the Shahdara, North-east, North-west, South, and East districts.Officials said these are densely populated areas, and do not have too many government-run medical facilities, so setting up outreach sites there will help boost vaccination numbers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/sunday-slots-draw-people-to-covid-19-jab-centres-101617575386746.html
05-04-2021||Delhi||New cases cross 4k mark in Delhi; most deaths in one day since Jan 1||The fourth Covid-19 wave continued to expand its footprint in the Capital, with Delhi adding 4,033 new infections on Sunday, the largest one-day spike in 121 days, even as the disease claimed 21 more lives — the most since January 1 this year. Experts implored the state government to ramp up its containment efforts and increase vaccine coverage to effectively curb the surge.Experts also flagged the steady increase in the city’s test positivity rate, which is an important metric to gauge the spread of an infection. Of the 86,899 tests conducted as per the Sunday health bulletin, 4.64% samples tested positive, up from 4.48% the previous day.Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Friday said a “fourth wave” of the Covid-19 pandemic was raging in the Capital, but did not impose a lockdown or any curbs to control the spike, even as he asserted that the government will scale up its testing, tracing, containment and vaccination efforts.However, experts said Delhi’s strategy could fall short of an effective mechanism to stop the pandemic, even as several other parts of the country considered stringent curbs to contain the fresh wave. Experts believe that regions seeing a surge in cases, such as Delhi, need to impose restrictions before it is too late, even as they try to accelerate vaccinations.Dr Lalit Kant, former head of the division of epidemiology and communicable diseases in the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), said: “The new-case graph is too steep. The positivity rate too is inching towards 5%, which is a greater matter of concern. It clearly indicates the government has to accelerate not only the vaccine drive, but also scale up tests, contact tracing and containment efforts. The state government must impose some restrictions aimed at controlling gatherings in both public and private spaces. Some strategic restrictions are very necessary at this stage.”The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends a test positivity rate below 5% for an infection to be considered under control in area. The Capital’s test positivity rate has been below this number for 123 days, but is fast approaching the threshold.Dr Jugal Kishore, head of community medicines department in Safdarjung Hospital: “The government should think about notifying and implementing regulations aimed at controlling gatherings in markets, malls, religious places, and consider further reducing permissible size of gatherings in marriage functions and funerals. A complete lockdown has adverse economic impacts but some strategic restrictions at this stage can go a long way in controlling the spread of the disease. Also, the government has to scale up tests, contact tracing and containment. The government should also start working on scaling up healthcare capacity once again.”Delhi reported its first wave in June, the second in September and the third in November, which has been the worst so far, with the highest case tally of 8,593 recorded on November 11.After the third wave in November 2020, Delhi witnessed a period of decline when, for nearly three months, the city recorded a positivity rate lower than 1%. A little over a month ago, Delhi reported 94 cases on February 16. The positivity rate that day was 0.17%. The case trajectory of the city — the seven-day average of new cases — was the lowest for the week ending February 12, when Delhi recorded 125 new cases per day, government records showed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/new-cases-cross-4k-mark-in-delhi-most-deaths-in-one-day-since-jan-1-101617575039702.html

But such incidents are condemnable as these are not a democratic way of protest,” said the CM during a brief interaction with mediapersons. Over the cancellation of his visit to Anwali village in Gohana of Sonepat, following reports of protests by farmers, the CM said he has written to the people of Anwali to inform them that he had to cancel the visit to avoid any law-and-order issues. “But I want to tell the leaders of opposition parties that they should not try to fulfil their political agenda through such means as it will cost them heavily. I decided to cancel my visit as we don’t want to cause any harm to the residents of Haryana,” he added.Police block roads for Khattar’s visitThe CM’s visit led inconvenience for Karnal residents as police turned the city into a virtual fortress and blocked the main roads leading towards Karna Park, where Khattar’s helicopter landed. Heavy barricading had been done around the venue, and trucks laden with construction material were used to restrict the movement of public. Several police nakaas had been installed near the Kalidas Rangshala, where the CM attended the programme. However, there was no call of protest by farmer leaders during this visit. CM announces salary hike for safai karamcharis Earlier, addressing Safai Mittar Utthan Sammelan in Karnal, the CM announced a hike in monthly salary of safai karamcharis, taking it to ₹14, 000 from ₹12, 500 in rural areas, and to ₹16, 000 from ₹15, 000 in urban areas. Khattar also announced that sewerman will get ₹12, 000 instead of ₹10, 000, and that the salaries will be disbursed in a timely manner and in case of any delay, they would get ₹500 extra.“If a sewerman dies on job, his family members will be given ₹5 lakh under the Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Suraksha Yojana, besides ₹10 lakh by the government. After addressing a gathering of Safai Karamcharis, Khattar said that in view of a surge in Covid-19 cases, people should take extra care to follow the guidelines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/opposition-leaders-instigating-farmers-khattar-101617568152271.html

A complaint in this regard had been moved to the NGT by a local councillor last year following which the Tribunal had formed a joint committee under HSPCB to look into the matter.After ground inspections, the HSPCB, in its report, stated that the sugar mill was located in an “over-exploited area” but it had been extracting groundwater, using a borewell, to meet its raw water requirements. This was done without the permission of the Central Ground Water Authority (CGWA), and hence illegal. The illegal extraction had taken place from April 15, 2015 to December 12, 2020.When contacted, Pradeep Ahlawat, the managing director of the sugarmill, refused to comment on the matter, stating that he “was busy in a meeting”.As per the NGT, the HSPCB regional officer had written thrice to the Panipat deputy commissioner for levying environmental compensation on the government-operated sugarmill.HSPCB member secretary S Narayanan said the penalty for illegal extraction of water is to be imposed by the CGWA or the deputy commissioner concerned.He said the HSPCB has calculated and recommended the environmental compensation based on the formula derived by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) and sent it to the deputy commissioner for imposition.The committee has submitted its report to the NGT and matter is likely to come up for hearing next week. In August last year, taking a serious note of environmental violations by the mill, the NGT had ordered the closure of sugar and distillery units at Panipat Cooperative Sugarmill until remedial measures are taken. “The norms under the Water Act, Air Act and the Environment Protection Act are also not being followed, which amounts to criminal offences. Groundwater is being illegally extracted which may seriously and irreversibly affect the environment,” the NGT order read.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/illegal-groundwater-extraction-hspcb-recommends-4-13-cr-penalty-for-panipat-sugar-mill-101617567612302.html
05-04-2021||Chandigarh||Amid infection surge, Haryana announces fresh curbs on gatherings||Amid the rising Covid-19 infections in the state, Haryana government on Sunday announced fresh guidelines for indoor and outdoor gatherings, besides funerals. While the gathering at funerals has been restricted to 50 people, at indoor events, 50% of the hall capacity and not more than 200 people will be allowed to assemble. For outdoor functions, the state government has allowed 500 people to assemble. The new guidelines will come into effect from April 5. “The new guidelines issued on Sunday will be implemented strictly in order to wipe out the virus,” said health minister Anil Vij. According to Sanjeev Kaushal, financial commissioner revenue and additional chief secretary, revenue and disaster management, the capacity of indoor places would be specified by the urban local bodies or the department concerned, keeping in view the calculated correlation between the number of chairs, seating or standing capacity and the covered area.The new guidelines were issued under the revised standard operating procedure for social, academic, sports, entertainment, cultural, religious, political functions and other congregations. While the authorities will focus on ensuring that Covid-appropriate behaviour, such as social distancing norms, wearing of face masks, sanitisation, hand hygiene and provision for thermal scanning, etc. are followed strictly, the organisers of social, academic, sports, entertainment, cultural, religious, political functions will have to take prior permission from the district magistrates. The district magistrates will give permission after seeking necessary approvals from the departments concerned, including the police.The government has directed the deputy commissioners (DCs) to constitute joint inspection teams for enforcing these instructions and ensure extensive checking, besides taking action against the violators as per law, rules, instructions and directions.Any violation of the guidelines will be punishable under the provisions of the disaster management Act-2005 and Indian Penal Code. 1, 904 fresh infections, 7 deaths in 24 hoursThe fresh restrictions came on a day when Haryana recorded 1, 904 fresh Covid-19 cases and seven deaths. The fatalities include three people from Kaithal district and one each from Sonepat, Ambala, Kurukshetra and Yamunanagar districts. Among the districts that saw a sharp rise in Covid-19 cases were Gurugram (555), Faridabad (151), Ambala (114), Karnal (185), Panipat (142), Panchkula (200), Kurukshetra (135) and Yamunanagar (98).

The soil was collected to build memorials at borders of Delhi in the memory of farmers who have died during the ongoing agitation against the ‘black laws’.The Punjab visit of the social activist was part of the second leg, with her journey starting from Dandi in Gujarat on March 30. The first yatra was carried out from March 12-28 in other states.“Previously, the government was snatching freedom from its citizens, but with the new farm laws it is also snatching life. If the silos of Adani and Ambani will be running, the Food Corporation of India would be closed. The ration scheme is being shut down. The government is also snatching democracy,” Patkar said.“The government made black laws illegally during the lockdown. We need to save our land, along with the repeal of anti-farmer laws. We have collected soil from 23 states. Our aim from this journey is to build memorials at Singhu, Ghazipur and other borders to inspire people about the struggle,” she added.---eom----Photo caption:Medha Patkar being honoured by farmers in Sunam on Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/patkar-slams-modi-govt-over-agri-laws-101617566532407.html
05-04-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai Metro-5 gets CRZ clearance||The Maharashta State Environment Impact Assessment Authority (SEIAA) has granted coastal regulatory zone (CRZ) clearance to the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority’s (MMRDA) Metro-5 line, which will connect Thane to Kalyan. The decision to grant CRZ clearance was taken during the 217th meeting of the SEIAA on March 18, the minutes of which were accessed by Hindustan Times.This development follows the Maharashtra State Coastal Zone Management Authority’s recommendation (from 2017) to grant CRZ clearance for the 25-km fully-elevated corridor, which will connect Thane’s Balkum Naka and to Kalyan APMC via the powerloom town of Bhiwandi and will have 17 stations. Currently, the areas are connected only via the overcrowded suburban railway. The cost of the project is pegged at ₹8,417 crore, with an expected ridership of about three lakh people each day by the year 2031.As per the MMRDA’s proposal, the Metro alignment will pass through two water bodies at Kasheli Bridge in Thane and Durgadi Fort in Kalyan. In Thane, the alignment will cut through a CRZ-I notified area for just over a km near Kasheli Bridge, while another 1.5-km will pass through a CRZ-II area. Another 608m of the alignment are passing through the Ulhas river. In Kalyan, about 20m of the alignment will pass through a CRZ-I notified area, while 250m will pass through a CRZ-III notified area. Another 320m will pass through the Ulhas river.With grant of CRZ clearance, the MMRDA now has the permission to build 156 piers (each being 1.8m in diameters) in CRZ-notified areas in order to support the above-ground corridor, which will be integrated with Metro-4 line at Kapurbawadi, and also with the suburban rail at Kalyan station. The piers will be built at intervals of approximately 25m between them.Dr Sonia Sethi, additional metropolitan commissioner and project director, Mumbai Urban Transport Project, confirmed the development, saying, “The SEIAA has accorded CRZ clearance to Metro Line 5 subject to certain conditions, such as necessary approvals from the MoEFCC and the Bombay High Court for mangrove areas affected.”In December 2020, the MMRDA has sought the MoEFCC’s go-ahead for diversion of 2349.5 sqm of mangrove forest land for the project. Of these, 1,971.71sqm of forest land are proposed to be diverted in Balkaum, Thane, while 377.86sqm of forest land are to be diverted in Kasheli in Bhiwandi. Officials confirmed the matter is currently under process, and that the Centre’s nod is still awaited before construction work can proceed.In a statement issued January 26 this year, the MMRDA had stated that work on the Metro-5 line is expected to be completed by December 2024.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-metro-5-gets-crz-clearance-101617566351590.html
05-04-2021||Mumbai||Out of jail for safety amid Covid, many return to criminal ways in Maha||The arrest of Vinayak Shinde, 53, in the case of the murder of Thane-based trader Mansukh Hiran, has brought into focus crimes committed by those released on bail or parole due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Starting March 25, 2020 over 10,000 convicts and undertrials were released on parole or temporary bail across Maharashtra to decongest the jails, following a decision taken by a High Power Committee (HPC). The Supreme Court (SC) ordered the constitution of a HPC in each state deliberating on the decongestion of the prisons in the wake of the pandemic. This committee was designated to determine which classes of prisoners were to be granted interim bail. Usually paroles are for 45 days to maximum 90 days as per prison rule, but owing to pandemic most of them are now out for almost a year. There are two types of leave parole and furlong. Parole is conditional, usually subject to behavior, and requires periodic reporting to authorities. Parole is not a right, and is given to a prisoner for specific reasons, such as a death in the family or a wedding of a blood relative. Furlough is given in cases of long-term imprisonment. The period of furlough granted to a prisoner is treated as remission of his sentence. Unlike parole, furlough is seen as a matter of right for a prisoner, to be granted periodically irrespective of any reason, and merely to enable the prisoner to retain family and social ties, and to counter the ill-effects of prolonged time spent in prison. Both are considered as reformative processes. These provisions were introduced with a view to humanising the prison system under the Prisons Act of 1894. In the recent pandemic, those released on temporary bail or parole will be out till the end of lockdown imposed by the state. Shinde was awarded life sentence in 2013 by Mumbai session’s court, long with 21 others involved in encounter of gangster Lakkhan Bhaiyya (Ramnarayan Gupta) in 2006. He was arrested on March 21 by the Anti-Terrorism Squad, in connection with the murder of Hiran, who is linked to the explosives-laden car found outside industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s house in February. Shinde is currently in custody of the National Investigation Agency (NIA) with co-accused Naresh Gor, a bookie. Suspended Mumbai cop, Sachin Vaze, who is also in NIA custody, is also suspected to have played a role in the murder. The high power committee conducted a meeting on March 25, 2020 and framed a policy to release the prisoners who are accused of offences punishable for less than seven years or less. However, this excluded those who are accused under special act such as Maharashtra Protection of Interest of Depositors (in Financial Establishments) Act, 1999 (MPID), The Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985 (NDPS), Protection of Children from Sexual Offence Act, 2012 (POCSO), Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act, 1999 (MCOCA), Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 2019 (UAPA) and Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 (PMLA). Like Shinde, some among those released, even on good behavior, have been put back in prison for committing petty thefts and robberies. In some cases, however, they’ve been imprisoned for more serious charges. In April 4, 2020, Navin Gotefode an undertrial released on parole, had attacked a constable’s wife in Nandanvan, Nagpur after she did not allow him to meet her son, who was a classmate of the convict. She was rushed to hospital but was declared dead. Gotefode, 26 was arrested in the murder case and is in Nagpur Jail. In October 2020, two cops – sub-inspector Dattatray Sarak, 36 and constable Anand Bhillare, 52, both of crime branch unit 1 of Thane police – were injured after a murder convict, Navnath Dhangade 35, who had jumped parole, attacked them with a sickle when they tried to arrest him in Wagale Estate, Thane. Dhangade was arrested while the two cops recovered after treatment in hospital. In 2015 Dhangade was booked are arrested by Shrinagar police in a murder case. Dhangade who was released on parole in April during lockdown for 45 days, did not return for over 15 days. So the Jail authorities reported to Vartak Nagar police station who arrested him.In December 2020, Aadesh Patil (35) was arrested for the rape and murder of a two-year-old girl, who belonged to a tribal community, in Pen, Raigad. The child’s great-grandmother reported seeing Patil dump the body near the family’s house. Patil was already serving sentence for rape in Alibag Jail. Meeran Borwankar, former state additional Director General of Police said, “It is important that the prison administration take reports from police before releasing habitual offenders involved in house breakings/chain snatching as well as for those in heinous crimes. Since conviction is often delayed in India, prisons would not keep track of the number and types of cases pending against criminals. The police will know and the Crime and Criminal Tracking Network & Systems (CCTNS) too has data about the activities of habitual criminals.” Cases like Shinde are one of its kind, and not many criminals involved in organised crime or in grave offences like rape, and undergoing life imprisonment, were released on special Covid parole, she added. As per the state prison department records, over 10788 prisoners were released till May last year to prevent the spread of Covid in the prisons. Out of these around 2166 were released on parole while 7271 were released on bail. Most convicts serving imprisonment or life imprisonment are released on parole and under trials are released on bail. A senior official from Maharashtra prison, who spoke on the condition of anonymity said, “However, after getting a special report from the prison and local police, the high power committee decided the release on parole. Shinde and the rapist in Pen, Raigad, though rare, are both serious instances. Both of them had good behaviour in jail that may have led to their approval for temporary bail or parole. Local police stations need to be more vigilant on those released on parole.” The HPC is headed by high court Justice Amjad Sayed and comprised of Sanjay Chahande, additional Chief Secretary (Home), SN Pandey, Director General, Prisons and Sunil Ramanand, Additional Director General, Prison. In some cases, inmates who were released in the de-congestion drive, were also in danger. In May 27, 2020, Nitin Shivaji Kasabe, a 24-year-old undertrial in a case of attempt to murder, came out from the prison on temporary bail and was attacked with sharp weapons by a group of eight persons in Yerawada area. The police suspects past rivalry. Munna Ishwar Chavan (23), a native of Georai in Beed district, who was released on April 15, was found dead on the footpath a couple of days later. He was brutally murdered, allegedly by a rival gang. Pune City Police have invoked the stringent Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA) against a gang allegedly involved in the murder. Yogesh Desai, Deputy Inspector General, South Region, Maharashtra Prison claimed that regular checks are being made on those released on parole. He said, “The state prison had released more than 10,000 inmates across Maharashtra. There are only a select few released on parole that get engaged in crime. Usually the inmates released on parole have an attendance to mark at the local police station. Our officials usually coordinate with the local police if the inmate jumps parole or gets involved in serious crime. Accordingly, the local police inform us to cancel the parole of the accused in such a serious case.” Professor Vijay Raghavan of the Centre for Criminology and Justice at the Tata Institute of Social Sciences said, “If we count the numbers as compared to the released prison inmates on parole, it is hardly a significant number. The release of prisoners on parole is in the thousands and only few cases have violated parole conditions. Any inmate with good behaviour inside prison is considered for release on parole or furlough on certain conditions. The emergency parole was granted to prisoners due to the pandemic and extraordinary situations demanding extraordinary solutions. Also, it is the job of the police to keep a watch to ensure that inmates released on parole do not re-offend.” He added that the official capacity of Maharashtra prisons is 23,000 while the present population inside prisons is around 34,870. At present there are 46 jails in Maharashtra including Central, District and open prisons. If another 10,000 inmates who have been released on emergency parole or temporary bail are back to prison, it will become impossible to manage the prison population. Sunil Ramanand, ADG (Additional Director General), Maharashtra prison refused to comment as he was deputed for election duty in West Bengal. BOX: The parole system Usually there are two types of leave: furlough and parole. Furlough leave is of 14 days, which can be extended to 14 days. It is available to convict who spent two years in jail. Parole is for 30 days for emergencies like illness or death of a family member. Parole can be extended for another 60 days. In 2012 the state government came up with a rule to permit parole once a year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/out-of-jail-for-safety-amid-covid-many-return-to-criminal-ways-in-maha-101617566291655.html

05-04-2021||Mumbai||Partial lockdown in Maha: ‘Only parcel services to cause major losses’||The state government’s decision to close down the hotels and restaurants from Monday night onwards and only allow parcel services will hit the sector badly, again leading to an exodus of migrant workers. Hoteliers say it would not be viable for them to survive on parcel services which account for only 5-15% of their total business.The Indian Hotels and Restaurant Association (AHAR), a leading association for the restaurants, called it a regressive step. “We can’t survive on parcels or takeaways. The hotels which are on lease will not open their establishments as they will not be able to pay rents nor the salaries of their staff,” said Shivanand Shetty, president, AHAR. “The government needs to understand that many prefer dining experience and will not settle for parcels,” he added.There are approximately 100,000 hotels and restaurants in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), with at least 18,00,000 employees. Of this, approximately 70% are migrants.According to Pradeep Shetty, senior vice-president, Hotels and Restaurants Association Western India (HRAWI), the workers are bound to go back to their native states. “It will be a repeat of 2020 when lakhs of migrant workers will return in large number to their villages. We are in no position to house them and pay them regular salaries,” said Shetty. He condemned the closing down of the hotels as the last nail in the coffin. “Many hoteliers took loans to restart their businesses after seven months of lockdown last year. It will be impossible for them to repay,” he added.Last year, the hotels which were closed for almost seven months opened on October 5. In the past five months, they were able to generate a business of almost 65-70 percent of the pre-Covid-19 times.However, the night curfew which was imposed from March 27 where the hotels needed to close down their establishments by 8:00 pm reduced their business down to 20 % of the pre-Covid-19 levels.The KOSMIC group of hotels which has four lounges across Mumbai said the staff will have to take a pay cut. “It makes more sense to close down completely than open for parcel service. I plan to give my staff 50% cut in their salary,” said Romi Chadha, owner of KOSMIC Group.Savio D’sa who is the consultant for the hospitality sector condemned the decision. “The government is painting the hotels as spreaders of Covid-19. They need to understand that this sector generates huge employment and contributes substantially to the state exchequer,” said D’sa. “Those people planning to start restaurants will be dissuaded by this move.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/partial-lockdown-in-maha-only-parcel-services-to-cause-major-losses-101617566171644.html

He said the state was ramping up tests to contain this virus. “We want to isolate patients and treat them to contain this virus,” he added.The state conducted 196,988 tests in the past 24 hours, compared to 184,404 tests the previous day.Mumbai also saw a huge rise as the number of active patients, now reaching 66,803 with the addition of 11,206 patients on Sunday.

The accused, who are the directors of Hicons Developer Private Limited, failed to deliver the flats to the buyers 10 years after accepting money from them.The accused, Nadeem Lakdawala, Rafiq Sheikh and Khalid Vasaiwala, have been booked under the relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code and the Maharashtra Ownership Flats Act (MOFA), based on the complaint of Khar businessman Narendra Narayan Pagrani.Lakdawala is the cousin of gangster Ezaz Lakdawala and was arrested by the Mumbai crime branch in March 2020 for helping the gangster in an extortion case. Pagrani, 48, had met the three accused in 2009 through a real estate agent as he was looking to buy flats. He visited the accused’s office for enquiry and was informed by the trio that their company owned five flats at Shubh Hari Darsham society in Khar. The developers said the building was old and was slated to undergo redevelopment. Its redevelopment rights were also with the Hicons Developer Private Limited, the trio had claimed.“The developers suggested Pagrani to buy these five flats from them instead of buying new flats. They offered him an additional 35% area (on each flat) for free on buying these flats. They also offered the complainant lucrative rate for the flats from the sale component that the firm would get after the society’s redevelopment,” said an EOW officer.“Pagrani found the deal profitable and informed his sister Sonia Punjabi and her husband Rajesh about it. The three decided to buy flats in the project,” said Sampat Chhawchharia, Pagrani’s lawyer.“Between 2011-2019 we paid ₹13.41 crore to the three accused after following the due procedure of buying five flats in the project. However, they haven’t delivered a single flat even after 10 years. The accused utilised the amount for some other purposes, and when we demanded our money be returned, they failed to do so and cheated our family,” said Pagrani.The accused could not be contacted as their mobile phones were found switched off.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/3-take-13-4cr-from-mumbai-buyers-fail-to-deliver-flats-after-10-yrs-booked-101617566111569.html

While the HSC exams will be held from April 23 to May 21, SSC exams will be conducted from April 29 to May 20. Over the past few days, there have been several protests by angry students, demanding that the exams be conducted online. Anubha Sahai, president of the Indiawide Parents Association, which has been supporting online exams, said that the government should rethink on its decision. “Physical exams are not going to be feasible at a time when the cases in the state are so high. Parents would not want to risk the health of their children in any case. The government should come up with a solution to address the issue,” said Sahai. Parents said that they are worried about their children being the carriers of the virus at homes. “We have senior citizens in the house, and while children have good immunity, we are worried for the other members of the family who are equally at risk when kids go out,” said Aashika Mhatre, whose son is a Class 12 science student. Some parents said they would not mind skipping the exams. “Exams are not more important than our children’s lives. We will not send them for exams if the cases continue to rise,” said a parent. Officials from the education department have maintained that exams will be held offline. “Considering the geography of the state, online exams are not feasible for all. Besides, considering the sheer volume of students, it is not an option,” said an official from the department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/ssc-hsc-exams-parents-anxious-about-sending-students-to-exam-centre-101617566051556.html

05-04-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: Shama’s luminous past||The building has lost its colour. A tree is growing out of the balcony.What rescues it from general anonymity, here in Delhi’s Asaf Ali Marg, is a rusting metal hoarding. One word is shining bright in white this afternoon — “Shama”. Urdu for candle. As in Dehli ki Aakhiri Shama, or Delhi’s last candle — the title of a 19th century poetry work.But this Shama was different.Among a certain generation in Delhi, and wherever Urdu was read, Shama, a monthly literary and film magazine, is remembered with a pang in the heart, as if one is mourning for their lost love. It had acquired such a cultish appeal that, in its heyday, from 1950s to the 1980s, its copies were smuggled by magazine suppliers to neighbouring Pakistan — according to Sadia Dehlvi who passed last year. Her grandfather, Mohammad Yusuf Dehlvi, founded Shama in 1939. Both her parents left their editing imprints in the publication group. Her father, M Yunus Dehlvi, the managing editor, died some years ago: Her mother, Zeenat Kauser, is today a citizen of neighbouring Gurugram and lives with her (late) eldest son’s family, in DLF Phase 1.According to information provided by Zeenat Kaiser’s younger son, Vaseem Ahmed, who lives in Mumbai, and her grandson, Ali Ahmed, who lives with her in Gurugram, the founder’s three sons shaped the magazine’s evolution. Sister publications were gradually added — Bano, Shabistan, Khilauna, Mujrim, Doshi (in Hindi), Aina and Sushama, which Shama translated into Hindi.Gradually, with the decline of the Urdu readership, say Vaseem and Ali, the magazine’s circulation plummeted, forcing it to publish its last issue in 1999.The Dehlvis, who ran Shama, could themselves have been its final cover story material. Their sprawling mansion in Delhi’s prized Sardar Patel Marg was celebrated for its soirées. Every film star landing in the capital would be obliged to stop by at their address. The late Sadia Dehlvi had hundreds of black-and-white photos showing Bollywood legends hanging out in her house. The family sold the bungalow four years after the magazine’s dissolution. Today, Zeenat Kauser, both the matriarch and the last principle living link to Shama, resides in quiet anonymity in the Millennium City, with her daughter-in-law and two grandchildren, including the aforementioned Ali whose passion is to collect every detail related to his family’s great legacy.In effect, while the old Shama survives as a relic in Delhi, those who would have been its inheritors, had it continued, live with Shama’s memorabilia across the border in Gurugram.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-shama-s-luminous-past-101617565712000.html

The state also recorded its highest one-day spike of 57,074 fresh infections. Besides a complete lockdown on weekends (see box), a strict night curfew of 11 hours and prohibition of gatherings of more than five people during the day, the state has announced shutting down of shops and establishments dealing in non-essential commodities, restaurants, eateries, malls, theatres, multiplexes and religious places.The state government has imposed three-fold restrictions from 8pm on April 5.

There will be complete lockdown on weekends between 8pm on Friday and 7am on Monday. Assembly of more than five people from 7am to 8pm has also been prohibited as per provisions of section 144 of CrPC, the notification issued by the government has stated.Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray convened an urgent meeting of his council of ministers on Sunday to deliberate on stricter curbs. The partial lockdown was allowed after the cabinet meeting and the detailed SOP was issued later in the day. Before the cabinet meeting, Thackeray spoke to leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis and Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) chief Raj Thackeray held meetings with key industrialists and producers of TV serials and films. Thackeray, in his address to the people of Maharashtra on Friday, had hinted at stricter curbs by the weekend. He also warned that the state was on the verge of a lockdown if the surge continued for another 15 days as there could be a serious shortage of beds and health services.Maharashtra reported its highest ever one-day spike of 57,074 cases, which led to breaching of the 3 million mark of cases, which stand at 3,010,597. Mumbai city remained the highest contributor to the daily caseload with 11,206 new infections, pushing the tally to 452,681. The active cases in the state stands at 430,503, including the highest number (81,317) in Pune and (66,803) in Mumbai.The surge in cases has resulted in a shortage of beds and oxygen in many cities and districts, forcing the state government to shut industrial units consuming oxygen in large quantities to shut.Under the new phase of Break the Chain, shops, establishments operating in non-essential commodities, hotels, multiplexes, theatres, water parks, clubs, salons and beauty parlours have been shut. Religious places across faiths have been shut down, though the priests attached to them have been allowed to carry out daily rituals at them. Private offices, too, have been instructed to go on work-from-home mode, while government offices are allowed to work at 50% of their work force. The private offices in essential services, including banking, insurance, pharmaceuticals, water-power supply are allowed to operate from offices, while government offices dealing with the Covid-19 pandemic will operate at 100% of their workforce.“We are not touching the industrial sector as it is directly linked with the financial health of the state. The industrial units, construction sites are allowed to operate, while the shooting of films and TV serials can go on by adhering to the Covid-19 protocol,” Nawab Malik, minority affairs minister, said after the cabinet meeting. He said that the public transport, including trains, buses, auto-taxis, flights can continue to operate by adhering to revised norms, Taxi and autos can operate at 50% of their capacity, while no standing passengers are allowed in buses and long-distance trains. The government has not reduced the timings of commuting in the local trains for the general public in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR). The state expects the crowding to reduce as private offices, shops, establishments in non-essential services are not allowed to operate. Similarly, the e-commerce sector has been allowed to operate with home deliveries allowed between 7am and 8pm. The vaccination of delivery boys has been made mandatory, though the notification is silent on how they will be vaccinated if they are below 45 years of age. The housing societies with more than five active patients will now be declared as mini containment zones, with not outsiders allowed to visit premises, according to the state notification. Fadnavis announced full cooperation with the state government. “We are going through a scary stage of the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic. The transmission of the virus is faster and proving fatal, leading to a rise in the mortality rate. We have appealed to BJP workers and leaders to cooperate with state authorities and actively participate in the vaccination drive. But at the same time, the state government should undertake awareness drive to apprise people with the fatal nature of the new strain. The state government should also stop the disconnection of the electricity supply for non-payment of bills,” he said.State health minister Rajesh Tope said that besides stepping up health care infrastructure, the state government is aiming at ramping up the vaccination drive. “After vaccinating 462,000 citizens on Saturday, we are now aiming to increase the daily numbers to more than 600,000 people per day by increasing vaccination centres and operating them 24X7. Our entire focus will be breaking the chain of transmission. Similarly, districts administrations have also been directed to increase the number of beds. To overcome the shortage of oxygen supply, which we have been facing even after reserving 90% of the production for medical purposes ,we have decided to shut down the industrial units consuming oxygen in large quantities,” he said. Tope said a decision about Class 10 and 12 exams will be taken after due deliberation with state board, central boards and experts form the education sector. “School education minister Varsha Gaikwad told the state cabinet that they have prepared various options in relation to Class 10 and 12 exams and the decision will be taken after due deliberation. She will discuss the issue with chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, officials from state board, other boards including CBSE, ICSE before arriving at a certain decision.

05-04-2021||Other||Bombay HC seeks stronger laws as man freed in daughter’s rape case||Expressing concern over the mother-son and father-daughter relationship not remaining sacrosanct anymore, the Bombay high court (HC) has appealed to the Centre and state government to incorporate amendments under the relevant laws to give statements recorded before a magistrate under section 164 of Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) the status of ‘examination-in-chief (vital evidence). The appeal came after HC had to set aside a special Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) court’s verdict, convicting a man for raping his minor daughter, as the survivor’s statement under section 164 of CrPC was insufficient and the guilt of the accused was not substantiated. The court, however, confirmed the conviction of the father under the Information Technology (IT) Act for having nude photographs of his daughter on his mobile phone. A division bench of justice Prasanna Varale and justice SM Modak, while hearing the appeal of the 39-year-old man, was informed that he was convicted in July 2015 for rape and criminal intimidation under the Indian Penal Code (IPC), section 4 (penetrative sexual assault) of the Pocso Act and section 67-B (publishing or transmitting of material depicting children in sexually explicit act in electronic form) of the IT Act. The man’s advocate, Aniket Vagal, submitted that though the minor had resiled during the trial, the special court had based its conviction on her statement recorded under section 164 of CrPC, and hence the conviction was arbitrary and should be set aside. The man worked as a watchman of a bungalow and used to live apart from his family. He had taken his daughter, then 14, to the bungalow in 2013, and raped her repeatedly for over a period of one year. She was threatened and not allowed to meet her mother, and was kept at her grandmother’s house. In 2014, after the girl informed her sister of her ordeal, their mother lodged a complaint. The girl’s recorded her statement with the magistrate and the police arrested the man and collected evidence from the bungalow. The police also recovered mobile handsets containing the nude photos and videos of the girl. However, during the trial, she resiled, and the court based its conviction on the statement recorded by the magistrate. After hearing the submissions, HC observed, “Due to globalisation, boundaries of nations have disappeared. During olden days, certain relations were considered sacrosanct. That is to say that the relationship between brother and sister, mother and son and father and daughter were considered sacrosanct. However, due to passage of time, these relationships have no more remained sacrosanct and there are various instances of overstepping the sacrosanct relationship by the near relationship.” With regards to the minor not supporting the trial, the court said, “Such incidents always take place in secrecy… Unfortunately, the victim had chosen not to speak about the incident before the court.” While setting aside the conviction for rape, the court directed the registry to send a copy of the judgment to the central and state law ministries to take an initiative in incorporating amendments under relevant laws to give status to statement under section 164 CrPC as that of examination-in- chief in all eventualities to avoid similar situation in future. The court however upheld the conviction of the father under the IT Act.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bombay-hc-seeks-stronger-laws-as-man-freed-in-daughter-s-rape-case-101617565692221.html

The hospital has been directed to conduct the post mortem by Monday, and submit a report by April 9.The directions were issued while hearing the petition filed by Jaiswar’s father Ravindra, seeking action against the police officers who were given a clean chit by the crime branch.

The next day, after he developed fever, he was taken to Sion hospital and discharged. He was admitted again after his condition worsened, and he died on July 21, 2018.

In a letter to his Uttar Pradesh counterpart, the additional chief secretary, home, Punjab, said suitable arrangements should be made for the transfer of the prisoner. “The handover is to be made at district jail Rupnagar on/before April 8.

05-04-2021||Chandigarh||Vaccination drive picks up pace in Punjab, over 2.5 lakh inoculated in 4 days||Of the 10 lakh beneficiaries administered Covid vaccines in Punjab since the commencement of the nationwide vaccination drive, including those with co-morbidities, only 89 experienced minor adversities after inoculation, data released by the state health department shows.The health department also claimed that no ‘severe’ case of adverse effects following immunization (AEFI) was reported in Punjab till Sunday.“Since January 16, nearly 10.63 lakh beneficiaries, including healthcare workers, frontline warriors and people above the age of 45, have been administered vaccine in the state. Of them, nearly 1.3 lakh beneficiaries were co-morbid with diabetes, hypertension and even serious diseases like cancer. Also, 1,21,826 beneficiaries have already taken their second dose of the vaccine cycle. However, only 89 of them experienced minor side effects and complained of fever, body ache, dizziness, headache while no one required hospitalisation due to severe adversities post-vaccination,” said Punjab nodal officer for Covid-19 Dr Rajesh Bhaskar. “The number of people developing fever post-vaccination could be more, but since it is a natural process after immunisation, not many people complain about it to the state health department. Also, the state health department kept a vigil on those 89 people who developed minor AEFI and all of them recovered in a day or two. They are now healthy and satisfied with the vaccination,” he added. Health experts believe that 89 is a ‘minuscule’ and ‘negligible’ number as the AEFI percentage in the state is as low as 0.0089%.“On an average, 30% of those being vaccinated are developing fever, but it is a natural process. Some beneficiaries, especially above the age of 60, experienced shivers, while some complaint of loose stools, abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting. This can be due to age-related ailments but no major cases, where vaccinated person required hospitalisation, have been reported,” said an Amritsar-based health expert, who didn’t wish to be named. The state nodal officer said at the time when many countries are investigating reports of blood clots among people who received the AstraZeneca-Oxford Covid vaccine, no such complications have been reported in Punjab.After the government’s move to include people above 45 years in the vaccination process from April 1, the drive rapidly picked pace in Punjab with 2.5 lakh beneficiaries being inoculated in the past four days.“Since a large population of people became eligible to take vaccine after April 1, more people are coming forward to take the shots. Also, since less incidents of AEFI are being reported, people are now shunning hesitancy and being less apprehensive about the side effects. We are expecting more people to join the drive in coming days,” said Dr Bhaskar.14% beds reserved for Covid patients occupiedWith the active cases increasing rapidly in Punjab amid the second wave of the pandemic, 14% of government and private hospital beds reserved for Covid patients are occupied, data available with the state health department shows.As per health experts, more severe cases with late detection of virus are being reported in the state as a result of which, hospitalisation of patients has also increased in the past few days.The state has reserved 8,400 level-2 beds in government and private hospitals for treatment of moderately ill Covid patients and 1,600 level-3 beds, including the intensive care unit (ICU) beds with or without ventilators, for critical patients.Nearly 1,092 (13%) level-2 beds and 272 (17%) level-3 beds were occupied till Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/vaccination-drive-picks-up-pace-in-punjab-over-2-5-lakh-inoculated-in-4-days-101617565033368.html

05-04-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab CM writes to Piyush Goyal seeking RDF at 3% of MSP||Chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh has written to Union minister for consumer affairs, food and public distribution seeking rural development fund (RDF) at 3% of the minimum support price ( ₹54.64/quintal) for the kharif (paddy) season 2020-21, instead of 1%, as per the revised provisional cost sheet issued by the department of food and public distribution. Pointing out that the RDF at 1% of the minimum support price (MSP) was contrary to the statutory provision as per Section 5 of the Punjab Rural Development Act, 1987, the CM, in his letter to Goyal, said the notified RDF was also in conflict with the department letter of February 24, 2020, vide which the revised principles of procurement incidentals were formulated in consultation with the states. “Any unilateral reduction in the RDF rate is neither as per the principles of procurement incidentals nor is it as per the law passed by the legislature of the state, and thus violates the system of federal structure of our nation,” said the CM. Noting that the market fee and RDF levied by Punjab are notified under a law, the CM said the RDF has been disallowed for the first time in the provisional cost sheet issued by the Centre. In a communication in October last year, the state department of food and civil supplies made a detailed representation to the Centre on the RDF, said the CM, adding that in a demi-official letter sent in December, he requested Goyal for early release of the RDF. Subsequently, in a letter sent in January this year, the state government had submitted requisite information sought by the Centre’s ministry of food and public distribution in October 2020. Further information sought by department of food and public distribution regarding details of RDF receipt and expenditure during 2018-19 to 2020-21 was submitted last month, said the CM. Amarinder also reiterated that there are statutory provisions for spending the levy collected under the RDF Act and it is beneficial for the development of rural infrastructure, which in turn positively impacts agriculture production and marketing of foodgrains.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-cm-writes-to-piyush-goyal-seeking-rdf-at-3-of-msp-101617564792499.html
05-04-2021||Chandigarh||DBT row leaves wheat growers worried ahead of procurement||Wheat growers are worried about smooth purchase of their rabi produce this season as the Punjab government and the Centre are engaged in a war of words over modes of procurement and payment to farmers.The Union ministry of consumer affairs, food and public distribution had informed the Punjab government that Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) to farmers is mandatory for the coming rabi (wheat) procurement season. However, the state has refused to implement it, and has sought appointment with Prime Minister Narendra Modi to discuss the issue and defer the scheme for at least one year.A section of cultivators from southern Punjab say they are not averse to payments made through arhtiyas, but the state government should undertake a pilot project of direct bank transfer (DBT) later this year for paddy purchase as the Cotton Corporation of India (CCI) has set an example of hassle-free purchase through online payments for the last two seasons.Wheat procurement is scheduled to start from April 10 as it has been delayed by 10 days due to the Covid-19 surge.A progressive farmer, Baldev Singh, from Bathinda’s Bajak village blames the state and Centre government for uncertainty even as the rabi crop is set ready for harvesting. “Punjab started raking up the issue of DBT a few days before procurement and for the entire year, the central authorities did not make public their follow-ups for implementation of new rules. Direct payment is not possible this time as Punjab has not even initiated any step to collect a database of farmland owners and cultivators. The governments should end the impasse in the interest of farmers and announce procurement through arhtiyas at least for this rabi season,” he said. Jagtar Singh of Mehma Sarja village in Bathinda, who cultivates wheat on nearly 40 acres on lease, said the uncertainty over procurement procedure is mounting pressure on farmers. “I have already paid half of the annual farm contract amount to the landowners and the deadline to settle payments of loans to banks and cooperative societies is April 30. Farmers cannot afford any delay or uncertainty. I will be able to sow cotton and paddy for the next kharif season only if I make the rest payments to landholders. The Punjab government should emulate the method of direct payment adopted by the CCI in the state since 2019. A DBT trial should be undertaken by Punjab for the paddy purchase to buttress its claim of rejection or accepting new rules,” he said.Field officials engaged in procurement also admit a tough season ahead. “Punjab has no land record database distinguishing between owner and cultivators to switch over to the DBT. Also, lack of space and shortage of gunny bags are other challenges ahead of staggering procurement plan,” said an official.According to Jagjit Dhaliwal of Acchadiki in Fazilka, farmers are eyeing the role of the state government for smooth wheat purchase. “Farmers do not resist payment through arhtiyas. But the procurement method and DBT has become a political issue ahead of 2022 elections.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/dbt-row-leaves-wheat-growers-worried-ahead-of-procurement-101617564612389.html

05-04-2021||Chandigarh||War of words: Jai Ram hurls ‘traitor’ jibe at BJP Mandi MLA||The no-holds-barred battle between chief minister Jai Ram Thakur and Mandi legislator Anil Sharma has intensified ahead of the Mandi civic body polls, with Himachal chief minister Jai Ram Thakur labelling the former Congress leader a ‘traitor’. His remarks come a day after the former power minister accused the CM of lying about the development undertaken in Mandi: “Jai Ram Thakur has begun lying in the company of Mahender Singh Thakur. He is making false claims on development of Mandi town,” Sharma had said. The war of words between the two stalwart BJP leaders began when the saffron party did not include Sharma, a local legislator from Mandi, in a panel constituted for the April 7 civic body polls. Instead, the CM entrusted the poll responsibility to Jal Shakti minister Mahender Singh Thakur. A peeved Sharma had announced that he will defy the party in the elections.Responding to Sharma’s allegation, the CM, who was in Sunderngar on Sunday, alleged that Anil had secretly campaigned in favour of his son, Ashray Sharma, who had contested the 2019 Lok Sabha elections on a Congress ticket.“First Anil’s family availed benefits while being in the Congress. The BJP also accorded them respect. However, Anil, not only gave up gave up his position in the Cabinet but has rebelled against the party on every front.” Thakur said though Anil’s family had been in politics for a long time, there had been no development in Mandi. “As a BJP legislator, he should have campaigned for the party,” the CM said. Sharma had on Saturday claimed that he was being marginalised. “I was not allowed to share the stage with him (CM). I received no invitation for the historic Shivratri mela. My son made the mistake of contesting on a Congress ticket. Why am I being punished?”Anil had joined the BJP ahead of the 2017 assembly elections along with his father and veteran Congress leader Pandit Sukh Ram. He won the election from Mandi and was made the power minister in Jai Ram’s Cabinet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/war-of-words-jai-ram-hurls-traitor-jibe-at-bjp-mandi-mla-101617564132575.html

Partner states of Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan will attend this technical committee meeting (TCM), where a plan for conservation of water will be drawn up. A BBMB source said the meeting would take place before April 10. Bhakra and Pong dams are on the Sutlej and the Beas rivers, respectively. The outflow from the two reservoirs is more than the inflow, as there is no rain in catchment areas and there is no prediction of showers. On Sunday, the water level in Bhakhra dam’s reservoir was 1,533.3 feet, 64 feet lower than the level at the same time last year, and nine feet lower than the 40-year average on the same day. Similarly, Pong dam had water level at 298.8 feet, 60 feet lower, and at least 23 feet below its 40-year average.“The water levels have dipped to alarming levels,” said a top functionary of the BBMB, on the condition of anonymity. The drop in water level is also significant from the maximum and the minimum readings: Bhakhra 1,680 and 1,462 feet, and Pong 1,390 and 1,260 feet. The Pong’s water level is critically low as a fall of 30 feet will empty the reservoir. Water levels are receding at rate of a feet per week and the filling season would not begin before June 1, and would extend up to September 20.From Pong reservoir, at least 2,000 cusecs water is flowing into the Indira Gandhi Canal taking water to Rajasthan; another 8,000 cusecs flows into the Nangal hydel channel that takes water to Haryana and Rajasthan, of which 500 cusecs goes to Delhi for drinking purposes.“These days demand in Punjab is negligible. It is, however, expected to increase manifold during paddy sowing season in mid-June,” said a board functionary. POWER GENERATION REDUCED TO HALFOwing to the dip in water level, power generation in Bhakra dam has been reduced to half. Against a daily maximum generation capacity of 28 million units, these days only 12-14 million units are being generated. There are six power houses in the dam, of which three are operational. The maximum outflow from the Bhakra dam touches 25,000 cusecs, as at least 10,000 cusecs is required for paddy sowing. In Pong dam, outflow in peak monsoon touches 12,000 cusecs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/alarming-dip-in-bhakra-pong-levels-bbmb-calls-meeting-of-three-states-101617563832085.html

Shiv Sena insiders said that Thackeray wants Deshmukh to be moved to another department, as he is facing a probe in his functioning as home minister. If not immediately, Deshmukh can be shifted out of the home department as a part of a minor reshuffle of the state cabinet, a senior Sena leader said. However, Thackeray and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar are yet to discuss the matter, the leader added. The Sena leader, who is a close aide of the CM, said the latter is not happy with the handling of the home portfolio by Deshmukh, which Thackeray had made clear to Pawar in one of their earlier meetings. “Uddhavji had conveyed his desire for change at the helm of the home department. There could be a reshuffle. CM is unhappy with the handling of the [Sachin] Vaze episode. According to CM, the minister did not have a firm grip on the department. We have seen how the leader of Opposition [Devendra Fadnavis] had more information [about the department] than the minister,” said the Sena leader, adding that Thackeray and Pawar would discuss these issues in the coming days. The leader said that this was not the first occasion where the minister had lacked better handling. Thackeray was unhappy with the way actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s death probe was handled, as the Opposition had attacked the Shiv Sena and a key cabinet minister in the case. The probe against Deshmukh will be conducted by a panel headed by retired Bombay high court judge Kailas Uttamchand Chandiwal. He has been given six months to submit his report to the state government. The panel has been tasked to examine if Singh submitted proofs to establish that Deshmukh or any staffer from his office committed any offence/misconduct as alleged in the former top cop’s letter and whether specific allegations raised by Singh, citing messages from assistant commissioner of police Sanjay Patil and former assistant inspector Vaze, had any truth and merited investigation by the state anti-corruption bureau or any other agency. The panel can also offer its recommendations that it deems fit. The high-level probe committee, however, has not been constituted under the Commission of Inquiry Act, and thus, the government is not required to make public the report or the actions taken based on its findings. Meanwhile, with back-to-back controversies, including the resignation of Sena minister Sanjay Rathod and the Vaze link to the Antilia and Mansukh Hiran death case has dented the image of the party. With less than a year for the prestigious Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation election, Sena’s dented image could become the fodder for Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) which is aiming to wrest control of the civic body from it. However, Shiv Sena chief spokesperson Sanjay Raut said that the issue has not spoilt the image of the party. “The Opposition has alleged many things, but it is their job to do so. In all this, it is the Opposition’s image and credibility that is hurt. The charges and allegations thrown at Shiv Sena or the government have not landed. Therefore, Shiv Sena’s image has not been hurt anywhere. The Vaze issue is now with National Investigation Agency (NIA), let them probe it. The government has nothing to do with it,” When asked if the Hiran case and Singh’s allegations could have been handled better by the Sena-led government, Raut said, “The government handled the issue in the way it wanted to. Had it been any other government, it could not have handled it in another manner.” A senior Sena functionary said that the learning was to not depend more on administration. “In the entire episode, what comes as learning is that one shouldn’t trust more than it is required. This is applicable from IAS officers to IPS to APIs,” he said. NCP minister and party spokesperson Nawab Malik was unreachable for a comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/maharashtra-cm-wants-home-min-replaced-sena-insiders-say-101617562932044.html

05-04-2021||Chandigarh||GMADA sets ball rolling to acquire land in Sector 101||Moving ahead with the acquisition of 500 acres of land for the development of industry in Sector 101, the Greater Mohali Area Development Authority (GMADA) has started the social impact assessment of the land.In July last year, the Punjab cabinet had given the nod to GMADA’s new land pooling policy for the industrial sector.Social impact assessment (SIA) is a process of identification, analysis and assessment of land to be acquired for development of industry. It analyses, monitors and manages the intended and unintended social consequences, both positive and negative, of planned interventions (policies, programmes, plans, projects) and any social change processes invoked by those interventions.GMADA has already issued a notification under Section 4 of the Land Acquisition Act for the said land.A senior GMADA official, on the condition of anonymity, said, “We have started the SIA process for land acquisition in two villages, Manuli and Durali. Industrial plots will be sized 550 square yards and 1,100 square yards.”On July 22 last year, for the first time, the state government had introduced a land pooling policy for industrial sector development, according to which for every 1 acre of land, land owners would get 1,100 square yards of industrial plots and 200 square yards of developed commercial plot, excluding parking, in lieu of cash compensation. Earlier, the land pooling was only for residential housing schemes.As per the new policy, the validity of the “Sahuliyat Certificate”, given to land owners opting for the land pooling policy and providing certain benefits to them during purchase of equivalent value of land, would be counted from the date of allotment of plot to the land owner. The previous validity was two years from the date of announcement of award.The certificate entitles a landowner to get exemption from stamp duty, besides certain other benefits/privileges when he/she purchases agricultural land with the sale proceeds from the developed plots obtained under land pooling. The move is in response to the demand of land owners that the validity be applied from the date they are offered physical possession of the plots on the ground that only when the basic infrastructure has been laid does a plot fetch its potential value.Between 2001 and 2017, GMADA acquired 4,484 acre land; 2,145 acres through the land pooling policy, which was introduced in the state in 2008, and has been amended from time to time.GMADA is currently facing the risk of paying an enhanced compensation of nearly ₹9,700 crore as per the decision of the first reference appeal in the courts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/gmada-sets-ball-rolling-to-acquire-land-in-sector-101-101617562391996.html
05-04-2021||Noida||Rental property sector in Noida sees an uptick as migrant population returns||The exodus of the migrant population that resulted after lockdown in the country last year had a huge impact on Noida’s rental and paying guest (PG) accommodation business. As working professionals and students who lived in the city left for their hometowns, brokers and landlords were left scouting for tenants.Upward curve in residential rental incomeKuldeep Singh, a broker in Sector 77, says that the rent for a three bedroom-hall-kitchen (BHK) apartment in the area reduced, from ₹13,000-16,000 earlier to ₹10,000 to ₹12,000 last year.“Between April and July, the situation was so bad that some landlords even reduced their prices to ₹8,000 for a three BHK in Sector 77 in order to earn a rental income during the lockdown,” he said.Industry experts echo the sentiment. Mani Rangarajan, Group chief operating officer (COO) of Elara Technologies that handles housing.com, Proptiger, and makaan.com, agrees, saying, “Many owners have rented out their homes on lower rates in light of Covid-19 to maintain the flow of a second income during these difficult times, especially the ones located in prime hotspots of the city”.Now however, almost a year since the lockdown was imposed, the situation has become better with many renters returning to the city. “From this year, the prices have increased to about ₹14,000-15,000. Though the demand is not the same, but we are hopeful that by June this year, it will get back to its original strength,” adds Singh.Another industry expert says that though work from home (WFH) continues in a majority of offices, the gradual opening of several other sectors has helped revive the market.“With WFH continuing in major IT companies, the downfall in terms of rental housing cannot be ignored. However, there has been a breather for the sector in Noida due to other industries and offices, apart from some IT firms, gradually restarting work-from-office post lockdown,” said Kapil Kapur, director – sales and strategy, Bullmen Realty.Vikram Negi, who works at an IT firm in Sector 62, recently moved with his family from Dehradun to a rented accommodation in Sector 151’s Jaypee Aman.“When my firm switched to WFH last year, I left with my family to our hometown. We used to live on rent in a two BHK in Sagar Apartments in Sector 62 for ₹15,000. Now, our office has started calling upper management employees for a meeting every two weeks so we had to come back. However this time, I did not have an obligation to live in Sector 62 and decided to get a two BHK+study in Jaypee Aman for ₹13,000. I don’t mind the drive to work as it is only twice a month,” says Negi.Besides, industry experts reveal that with remote working becoming a norm, people no longer have the obligation to live near their offices.“The WFH option is not going away anytime soon, and those who were living in two BHK apartments on rent in prime locations near their offices, like sectors 61-62, sectors 126-135 or sectors 91-93 near the NSEZs (Noida Special Economic Zones), are now exploring the two BHK+study apartments further along the expressway towards Sectors 150, 151 and even Noida Extension. The apartments there are bigger but cost the same at about ₹15,000,” says Santosh Agarwal, chief financial officer (CFO) and executive director of AlphaCorp, which has an upcoming project in Sector 150. He adds that a majority of such tenants are families whose children now need a separate study due to classes being held online.Paying guest accommodations struggle to surviveThose who ran PG accommodations for students in Noida have been hit the worst. Rahul Saini, who ran a two-storey PG accommodation in Sector 127, has now switched to letting out his property for rent. His property was majorly used by college students studying at various private universities in Noida.“I used to earn over ₹10,000 from each floor when I ran the PG accommodation. But after lockdown, students left for their hometowns and I had to turn the units into accommodations for renters. Now the rooms are rented for ₹6,000 each which has reduced my income by 40%,” says Saini, who is a resident of Raipur Khadar village in Sector 126.On the other hand, the situation has started to look up for PG operators who cater to working professionals.“Since November last year, our PG accommodation has been partially occupied. However, from February this year, it has been taken up fully as most people working in nearby offices, like in Sector 16, have come back to the city,” says Pankaj Bisht, who runs a PG accommodation in Sector 27.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/rental-property-sector-in-noida-sees-an-uptick-as-migrant-population-starts-coming-back-101617561856509.html
05-04-2021||Other||Prayagraj scientist develops two ‘super wheat varieties’||A 79-year-old genetic scientist at Sam Higginbottom University of Agriculture, Technology and Science (SHUATS) has developed two semi-dwarf high yielding wheat varieties—SHIATS-W6 and SHUATS-W10, that are sugar free, high in nutrition, use less water and are resistant to extremes of Indian weather. The senior scientist, Mahabal Ram, a professor (emeritus) at the institute, has also written to the UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath urging him to ensure wider use of these nutritive-rich super wheat varieties that are already notified by Central Variety Release Committee of the Union Ministry of Agriculture-New Delhi and are under limited cultivation in the state. In his recent letter to CM, the Prayagraj-based scientist has highlighted that the two wheat varieties combine high yield and higher protein, zinc, iron, fiber contents while also being free of sugar (below detection limit) that is ideal for a state like UP that suffers from malnutrition on one hand and challenges of climate change like sudden heavy rains and very dry summers with high temperatures on the other. He has urged that these wheat varieties be distributed to the people under the public distribution system as well. The innovation comes amid growing concern over falling farm output, including that of wheat, owing to rising temperature and unpredictable rainfall. Prof Ram, an eminent geneticist and plant breeder of international repute, said the State Variety Release Committee (UP, Lucknow) has also formally released these two varieties for cultivation. Already thousands of farmers in 11 districts have started cultivating these new wheat varieties. These districts include Prayagraj (Allahabad), Kaushambi, Pratapgarh, Fatehpur, Mirzapur, Varanasi, Jaunpur, Azamgarh, Ghazipur and Mahoba, he said. “These two wheat varieties can tolerate temperature as high as 40 to 42 degrees Celsius against 30 to 32 degrees of average regular varieties, sown by farmers traditionally. They can even withstand water logging for even 7-8 days and still flourish,” he claimed. Cost of production of these two SHUATS wheat varieties is lower by 30-35% as compared to Centrally (ICAR) released wheat varieties (PBW 343, HD 2967 and DBW 187), he said. Based on grain quality analyses done by CSIR-Central Food Technological Research Institute Mysuru, SHIATS-W6 has been found to possess Protein (14.31%), Zinc (3.44mg/100g), Iron (3.54mg/100g), Fibre (2.89%) and Sugar-Below Detection Limit (BDL) i.e. free from sugar. Second variety, SHUATS-W10 has been found to possess Protein (12.56%), Zinc (3.19mg/100g), Iron (3.39mg/100g), Fiber (2.49%) and Sugar (0.2%). In the contrast, India’s most famous wheat variety HD 2967 evolved by ICAR-Indian Agriculture Research Institute, New Delhi possesses Protein (12.86%), Iron (2.89mg/100g, Zinc 93.29mg/100g0, Sugar 90.2%0 and poorest in Fiber (0.83%) content. The grain quality data available on internet of winter wheat grown in USA and European countries possesses Protein (13.31%), Iron (3.60mg/100g); lower in Zinc (2.60mg/100g); poor in fiber (1.03%) content and high in sugar (0.41%), he pointed out. Thus, superiority of SHIATS-W6 and SHUATS-W10 in nutritive values is well established over India’s top wheat variety HD 2967 as well as winter wheat grown in western temperate countries. In total carbohydrates, SHIATS-W6 has the lowest value (69.98%). It is followed by SHUATS-W10 (71.44%).On the other hand HD 2967 possesses highest Carbohydrate 75.02% content. In diet, carbohydrates should be less because on digestion, it is converted into sugar. People suffering with diabetes need food lower in carbohydrate, he explained.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/prayagraj-scientist-develops-two-super-wheat-varieties-101617561856015.html
05-04-2021||Chandigarh||Himachal braces for 3 days of thunderstorms, gusty winds||A western disturbance in the region will bring another spell of rain and snow in Himachal Pradesh, officials of the weather department said on Sunday. Shimla meteorological centre director Manmohan Singh said, “A yellow weather warning had been issued for thunderstorm, hailstorm and lightening in the low and middle hills from April 5 to 7.The region will also witness gusty winds blowing at 30-40 km per hour.” There was a slight increase in day and night temperatures across the state. The minimum temperatures increased by 1-2°C. However, they were 3-4°C below normal. Keylong, the administrative headquarters of the tribal Lahaul-Spiti district, was the coldest place in the state recording minimum temperature of minus 1.8°C while Kalpa in Kinnaur shivered at 1.1°C.The state’s capital, Shimla, recorded a low of 10.5°C while Dharamshala recorded 10.8°C temperature.Popular hill stations, Manali, Palampur Dalhousie and Kufri recorded a temperature of 3°C, 8.5°C , 6.1°C and 2.4°C, respectively. Rain is vital for rabbi crops as the winters were unexpectedly dry. The arid climatic conditions across Himachal have caused extensive damage to crops.In March, the hill-state recorded a cumulative rain deficit of around 62%. About 30-40% wheat crop has been damaged in the state and farmers are staring at huge losses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/himachal-braces-for-3-days-of-thunderstorms-gusty-winds-101617561733747.html
05-04-2021||Kolkata||West Bengal polls: Tough contest between TMC, BJP on 31 seats in phase 3||The 31 assembly seats that will go to the polls in the third phase in West Bengal on April 6 are likely to witness a tough battle between the Trinamool Congress (TMC) and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) because of the demographic character of some of the constituencies and strong presence of the ruling party. The polls will be held in Hooghly, South 24 Parganas and Howrah districts. The last two are located adjacent to Kolkata.In Hooghly district, where eight seats are slated to go to the polls, the BJP made sizeable inroads in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. Actor-turned-politician Locket Chatterjee managed to wrest the Hooghly Lok Sabha seat while the BJP lost the Arambagh seat by about a thousand votes only. Chatterjee, who is one of the four BJP Lok Sabha members in the fray, is now contesting the Chinsurah assembly seat which is part of her Lok Sabha segment. Swapan Dasgupta, the BJP’s Rajya Sabha member who resigned from the Parliament to contest the local elections, is contesting against the TMC’s Ramendu Singha at the Tarakeshwar seat in Hooghly district. “It is now my responsibility to win the seat,” Dasgupta told the local media during a door-to-door campaign on Saturday. In South 24 Parganas district, where as many as 16 assembly segments are going to the polls, several are part of the Diamond Harbour Lok Sabha constituency held by chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s nephew Abhishek Banerjee. The TMC’s youth wing president held five rallies and roadshows as campaigning came to a close at 5 pm on Sunday. Also read: ‘TMC’s days about to end’ - Adhir Chowdhury urges TMC supporters to join CongressIn South 24 Parganas, many assembly segments, such as Canning East, Baruipur East, Baruipur West and Diamond Harbour, Muslims comprise a sizeable section of the population. While this may make the contest easier for the TMC, since Muslims have backed the party consistently, allegations of corruption during the distribution of relief items for victims of cyclone Amphan has been made the main election issue by the BJP and the Indian Secular Front founded by cleric Abbasuddin Siddiqui.Mograhat East, Bishnupur, Mandirbazar, Joynagar, Basanti, Kultali and Canning West are reserved for scheduled caste candidates. In these seats, the Left parties had a strong presence till 2016 and the Marxists are desperate to make a comeback. At Raidighi, CPI(M) stalwart and former minister Kanti Ganguly is contesting the seat again. In Howrah, where the TMC has a strong presence, only seven seats are going to the polls. Out of these, the BJP intends to put up a tough fight at Udaynarayanpur, Jagatballavpur, Uluberia North and Uluberia South. Among the BJP’s other prominent candidates in the third phase are Debjit Sarkar, former president of the party’s youth wing in Bengal, and actress Tanushree Chakraborty who joined the saffron camp only days before her name was announced. While Sarkar is contesting the Jangipara seat in Hooghly, Chakraborty has been fielded from Shyampur in Howrah.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/west-bengal-polls-tough-contest-between-tmc-bjp-on-31-seats-in-phase-3-101617561732573.html
05-04-2021||Noida||Think about duties before asking for rights: Ghaziabad admin||To pacify protestors who agitate on the collectorate premises for various reasons, the Ghaziabad administration has started a new initiative.Under this, while receiving the memorandum or charter of demands from agitators, officials will hand over a pamphlet displaying the charter of 10 fundamental duties to them.District magistrate Ajay Shanker Pandey said: “As per our records, over 50 agitations have been held in the last three months at the mandated dharna-sthal in the Collectorate, including by farmers’ unions, residents’ welfare associations (RWAs) and parents’ associations. They claim that demonstration is their right, but the district administration wants to remind them about the 10 fundamental duties – expected to be followed by all bona-fide citizens,” he said.He further said that with this move, people will understand the reciprocal relation between fundamental rights and duties. “So far, it has put a positive impact on demonstrations in the collectorate premises as they have started abiding by the law more and the participants remain peaceful,” Pandey said.Meanwhile, activists and residents welcomed this move. Zakir Hussain, district vice-president of Jan Adhikar Party, said it was the best possible way to pacify the demonstrators. “How can a group of agitators be violent if district officials hand them over a pamphlet of fundamental duties, instead of ordering lathi-charge? This is the real Gandhigiri,” he said.Echoing similar views, Archana Lal, a college teacher living in Vasundhara, said by adapting this innovative way, the admin has given a message of making proper coordination between fundamental rights and duties. “It’ll motivate the common people to feel that they must be able to deserve before making any desire,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/think-about-duties-before-asking-for-rights-ghaziabad-admin-begins-a-new-way-to-tackle-demonstrators-101617561673843.html
05-04-2021||Delhi||Delhi Police go all out to crack down on Covid violators||From booking owners of pubs, restaurants and banquets to recommending the cancellation of licences, the Delhi Police have begun conducting special drives against those violating Covid-19 safety protocols amid a surge in infections in the national capital.The Delhi Police said at least 17 FIRs were registered against owners of restaurants, pubs and banquets across Delhi on Saturday evening and four were arrested.As many as 173 challans were slapped on people at restaurants, pubs and banquets on the intervening night of Saturday and Sunday. While 118 challans were issued to the owners, staff and visitors at various restaurants in Delhi, 48 challans were issued to violators at banquet halls and seven such challans at night clubs, said Delhi Police.Comparatively, a month ago on March 4, the Delhi Police issued just 65 challans for Covid-19 protocol violations across all places in Delhi.Chinmoy Biswal, spokesperson for Delhi Police, said the action against violators of Covid-19 protocols is being stepped up in view of the surge in Covid-19 cases. The city reported over 3,500 new infections on Friday and Saturday each.“We are particularly checking restaurants and bars on weekend evenings because there is usually more crowd that time. The crackdown on violators will continue throughout the week,” said Biswal.In some districts, the police went on to recommend cancelling the licences of some restaurants. In south-east and north districts, the police wrote to the respective municipal corporations, the licence department and the excise department to cancel the licences issued to four businesses. “We have cited Covid-19 violations as the reason for cancelling the licences of two night clubs,” said RP Meena, deputy commissioner of police (DCP) for south-east.Anto Alphonse, DCP (north), said while his district has fewer restaurants and bars, two restaurants in the Civil Lines were most likely to lose their licences. ”We have fewer restaurants and large markets with high footfall. In the last 10 days, we have issued 1,500 challans,” said Alphonse.In south-east district, the police registered 10 FIRs against owners of some clubs, bars, cafes and restaurants -- including some popular ones in places like Nehru Place and Amar Colony-- on Saturday night. In west Delhi too, the police booked owners of five restaurants and bars between Saturday evening and midnight.In New Delhi district, the police carried out special drives both on Friday and Saturday in establishments where high footfall was expected. Owners of four restaurants were booked for not ensuring compliance to Covid-19 safety norms. The police also visited Khan Market and a five-star hotel in New Delhi district to prosecute 12 visitors for not wearing face masks.“Some of these restaurants were not ensuring social distancing among customers in their premises. Some didn’t even have sanitizers. In another place, the staff was serving food without masks or hand gloves. We will be intensifying our action in the coming days,” said Vikas Kumar, additional DCP, New Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi-police-go-all-out-to-crack-down-on-covid-violators-101617561672680.html
05-04-2021||Delhi||Police probe demolition of Sai Baba idol in Shahpur Jat||Delhi Police on Sunday said they had launched a probe in the video in which a man is spotted hammering and demolishing the statue of Sai Baba — a spiritual leader revered by the Hindus — inside a temple in south Delhi’s Shahpur Jat.The alleged perpetrator can be heard saying that Sai Baba was a Muslim, as he takes hammer swings at the idol in the viral video that surfaced online last week.According to Atul Kumar Thakur, deputy commissioner of police (south), the police began their enquiry into the incident after receiving a complaint from a bunch of local devotees. “We are looking into the incident. We are yet to register a case,” said Thakur.While the police said that the people they interrogated so far have claimed that the idol was already “khandit” or broken and was to be replaced, the a middle-aged man dressed in a pale-blue shirt captured on the video, identified as Padam Panwar, can be heard saying that he decided to get the idol removed as Sai Baba was a Muslim.“I personally got the statue installed in 2009. But now that I got to know that Sai Baba was a Muslim, I got the statue removed. Sai Baba was no God, he was a common man,” Panwar, 55, is captured saying on the video,Panwar said he lives in Shahpur Jat itself and has a real estate business.In the video doing rounds on social media, Panwar first instructs a worker to uproot the idol with a crowbar. He then wields a hammer himself and hits the statue multiple time, before talking to the camera and stating that Sai Baba was no god, but a Muslim.A second video later emerged in which Panwar is purportedly seen in the company of Yati Narsinghanand Saraswati — a priest of Dasna Devi temple in Ghaziabad — who was booked by the Delhi Police on Saturday for allegedly making inflammatory comments against the Prophet at a press conference.Saraswati couldn’t be reached for a comment on the issue, with Delhi police also stating that they were yet to ascertain if Panwar was the man seen in the other undated video with Saraswati. Contacted, Panwar, however, said it was indeed him in the video.“This temple was constructed by my ancestors even before Sai Baba was born. But I have got to know now that he was a Muslim. He cannot share the same space that is occupied by Hindu gods,” said Panwar.Panwar claimed that he was questioned by the police on Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/police-probe-demolition-of-sai-baba-idol-in-shahpur-jat-101617561673191.html
05-04-2021||Delhi||Supporting farmers curbed my powers in Delhi: CM Kejriwal||Stating that the Centre has curbed his powers in Delhi as he extended support to the farmers protesting against the agricultural reforms, Delhi chief minister and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) chief Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday said that he is ready to “make the supreme sacrifice” for the farmers.Addressing a mahapanchayat at Jind, Kejriwal said, “The Union government has been pressuring me to convert nine stadiums in Delhi into temporary jails for farmers who reached Delhi’s borders on November 26 last year. I had refused the Delhi police’s proposal. The Haryana government, on the other hand, dug up roads to stop the farmers from marching towards the Capital and even resorted to lathi-charge. Where the UP police snapped all facilities on their side of the border, the Delhi government made arrangements for water, toilet, electricity and free wi-fi for the farmers.”He added, “I called up Rakesh bhaisahab (Tikait) and asked him not to break down as we provided all facilities within an hour to the farmers.”“I had to bear the brunt of supporting the farmers’ movement as the BJP government at the Centre snatched my powers and gave it to the Lieutenant Governor. The people of Delhi have given me enough mandate to solve their issues but the government has given powers to LG. There seems to be no importance for an elected representative,” he added.The Delhi chief minister further said the real patriots are those supporting the farmers while those standing against them are ‘traitors’.Speaking about the lukewarm response at the rally, the AAP supremo said farmers have blocked all roads in the state to lodge their protest against the Haryana government, which had directed the police to lathicharge farmers in Rohtak a day earlier. “I have come here to thank the people of Haryana for leading the agitation with the brothers of Punjab. I condemn the Rohtak incident where police used force on the protesters,” said Kejriwal.Also Read | Centre should withdraw NCT Bill, restore powers of Delhi govt: Mallikarjun Kharge‘They have power, no intention to serve’ Stating that his government has been able to bring in more development than the states ruled by the BJP, Kejriwal said, “They have formed governments in many states and at the Centre too but they have failed to bring development projects. In the last seven years, the BJP government failed to construct new schools, hospitals or other institutions. Our government has worked many times more than the combined works done by the BJP governments in other states. They have more powers but have no intention to do work, but we have less power and clear intention to serve the people.”“If our government can provide water, education, health and electricity free of cost, why could the BJP and Congress government not do so for the last 75 years? I have only one dream—that is to make India the number 1 country in the world,” he added.MP Sushil Gupta trains guns on Khattar Rajya Sabha MP Sushil Gupta said, “The BJP leaders called farmers terrorists, Khalistanis and traitors. But the sons of these farmers are protecting our borders.

05-04-2021||Delhi||Row after Messi images painted over street art||The wall leading to the entrance of the primary municipal corporation school in south Delhi’s Hauz Khas Village is painted with “Clean India” slogans, and the back of the school’s building now has murals of footballer Lionel Messi – as part of a campaign launched by Budweiser India.Three such murals have come up in the neighbourhood in the past one month. At least two of the new artworks were painted over existing murals created by artists Okuda San Miguel and Mariusz Waras in 2014.On Saturday, several artists – under the banner of St+art India Foundation, which works to promote street art, shared pictures of the murals on social media, raising concerns over “advertising in the name of street art” and promoting an alcohol brand on a school building.Hanif Kureshi, artistic director at the foundation, said: “We had painted the school in 2014 by collaborating with the famous Spanish artist Okuda. Now, in the name of art and football, this is like subconsciously advertising alcohol by removing iconic artwork. We are not targeting a specific company, but any brand should not use public walls for such purposes. It defeats the purpose of street art.”The mural on the building, made by Okuda, consisted of a mix of geometric patterns and animals in bright colours to depict the theme of “spiritual capitalism”. According to the artist, the artwork aimed to show the conflict between roots and capitalism by using forms of animals revered in Indian culture, such as monkeys, cows and bears.On Sunday, that wall, which faces the HKV parking lot, had a mural covering almost the entire length of the three-storey school building depicting Messi’s journey. It includes details on his life, like his birthplace Rosario, Argentina and his youth team. A young “Leo” is also seen holding hands with an elderly lady, and standing with a football under his right foot. In the far right corner of the mural is a QR code that provides the link to the website ‘budspace.in’, which now states that The Budweiser Road to Glory campaign is over.Despite repeated attempts, the South Delhi Municipal Corporation’s (SDMC) press director, Sanjay Sahay, did not comment.Deavinder Kumar Chaudhary, president of HKV-Residents Welfare Association, said: “They had come to us to seek permission saying they wanted to make football-related artwork. So we allowed them. We don’t want any controversy, so if there is something related to liquor, they have misled us and I will get it removed tomorrow [Monday] itself.”Narendra Chawla, leader of the House in SDMC, said: “No such murals or paintings which directly or indirectly promote liquor are allowed on any of our school walls. We are checking if any permission was sought to create this mural on our school wall.”A Budweiser India spokesperson said that they believed in the “power of art” and wanted to show Messi’s journey to inspire people.“As part of curating these murals, we reached out to multiple artists including St+art India, and collaborated with artists that met our creative and commercial direction through these illustrations that they curated over months. Our aim was always to offer the insider perspective into the G.O.A.T’s (greatest of all time) iconic journey and inspire fans through creative murals that celebrated his journey. As part of curating these murals, we ensured that these walls are first restored and will continue to support the creator community,” the spokesperson said.Kureshi said that they had been approached for the same campaign in August last year. “They (Budweiser) had contacted us and wanted to do 100 murals. We said at that point that they had to do something meaningful and not just paint anything because then it would be outright advertising. It was a difference of vision and there was no further communication on it,” he said.Meanwhile, a group of graffiti artists defaced two of the Messi murals in the area on Sunday.Kulveen Trehan, who teaches advertising to postgraduate students and research scholars at Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University, said: “Liquor brands often roll out campaigns where their product is not mentioned i.e. surrogate advertising as they are not allowed to advertise liquor directly.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/row-after-messi-images-painted-over-street-art-101617561613610.html

The police and the victim’s family suspect that the boy was allegedly kidnapped and murdered. According to the family members, they did not get any ransom call.The family of the victim placed the body on a road on Sunday afternoon, and held a protest demanding the arrest of the suspects involved in kidnapping and murdering the child.The three-year-old lived with his family in Dadri. His father, who works in Greater Noida as an engineer, said his son and two elder daughters — aged five and six — were playing outside their home on Wednesday. “The three were eating ice-cream outside the house around 10.30am. My son stayed outside while the girls returned. After some time, we came out and could not find him. We searched our neighbourhood, and informed our friends and relatives, but failed to trace him,” Munendra said.Sub-inspector Johar Singh said the Dadri police have registered a case of abduction against an unknown person under Indian Penal Code (IPC) Section 363. “We could not find the boy in the neighbourhood. The Bulandshahr police informed us on Sunday that it found a child’s body,” he said.The victim’s family visited Bulandshahr and identified the child by his clothes and shoes.Santosh Kumar Singh, senior superintendent of police, Bulandshahr, said the local police had spotted the body floating in the Ganga canal in Bulandshahr police station area. “The canal route connects Greater Noida with Aligarh, via Bulandshahr. It appears someone killed the boy and dumped his body three days ago, as it was swollen,” Singh said, adding that the body was sent for post mortem, and the report is awaited.The report will be shared with the Noida police for further investigation, Singh added.Meanwhile, Vishal Pandey, additional deputy commissioner of police, Greater Noida, said a police team is at the spot of the protest by the victim’s family, held between 3:45pm and 6pm. The protesters cleared the road after the police assured them of swift action in the case. “We are investigating the matter, and the suspects will be arrested soon,” Pandey said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/missing-3-year-old-found-dead-in-ganga-canal-in-bulanshahr-101617561612542.html
05-04-2021||Noida||Noida board meeting to be held on April 9||NOIDA: The Noida authority is scheduled for a board meeting on April 9, during which it might approve a proposal that allows it to acquire agricultural land from owners through ‘land pooling’ policy.Once the proposal is approved, land needed for infrastructural, industrial and other developmental projects will be acquired via this policy.Officials said this policy will help acquire land in a litigation-free manner with ease, help the authority ready a land bank, and use the ready land for setting up industrial and IT-enabled units. The authority wants to adopt this policy as it has a task at hand to acquire 20,000 hectares of agricultural land in 80 more villages. The policy will make it easier for the authority to ready developmental land as officials said they believe that farmers will be happy with it because it gives them an opportunity to become stakeholders in the projects.“In land pooling, farmers have a choice to take back some part of developed land for his use or earn rent. As a result, it will be in favour of farmers and make the land acquisition task easier,” said Santosh Kumar Upadhyay, officer on special duty of the Noida authority.Under this police, land will be acquired at those sites where at least 80% farmers are willing to give up the same. Besides, the authorities can acquire the remaining 20% land by using the 2013 Land Act provisions. At least 25 acres or above sized land should be given priority under this policy and the land should be located at an 18 metres or wider road so that parking and other supporting services can be developed. Instead of money for their land, the policy allows the authority to provide 25% of developed land out of the total acquired to a farmer. Farmers will have the right to use 80% of the land (out of 25% developed) for industrial usage, 12% for residential and 8% for commercial use. If they so wish, the farmers are free to sell it to anyone, including to the government. Once a farmer applies, the CEO will form a committee that will address the farmers’ application suitably. The authority will give a rent of ₹5000 per month for an acre of land to farmers until the owners do not get the developed land.“This policy will help in development of new Noida, where 20,000 hectares of land needs to be acquired in 80 new villages towards Bulandshahr,” said Upadhyay.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-board-meeting-to-be-held-on-april-9-101617561613042.html

KMC Language University has decided that classes for all its undergraduate courses will be run online while classes for PG, B Tech and PhD will be in offline mode. “Teachers taking online classes will have to send a record of what they had taught to students on daily basis to my office,” said vice chancellor prof Vinay Kumar Pathak.Besides, the university has formed a committee to interact with other universities on how the classes will be carried forward in days to come. “All teachers above 45 should get themselves vaccinated. The university will soon call a team of doctors to carry out Covid test on teachers,” prof Pathak added.Likewise, AKTU has decided to shift to online or offline or a mix of both media to conduct classes in the wake of rising Covid cases. The university has empowered its affiliated engineering colleges to decide on taking theory and practical classes either online or offline as per Covid situation in their areas. The university has further asked the colleges to ensure that Covid protocol is followed strictly.Regarding students living in hostels, the university has suggested to allot one room per student on the basis of merit. Lucknow University was among the very first universities to switch to online classes. They will continue with online teaching till April 10. The LU has also postponed its undergraduate first semester examination beginning April 6.Taking a cue from the Lucknow University, a number of degree colleges, including Avadh Girls’ Degree College and IT College, have also switched to online mode. “National PG College has also switched to online mode besides postponing its examination lined up from April 5,” said Dr Rakesh Jain, the college’s admission coordinator. After a number of teachers at degree colleges affiliated to the Lucknow University tested Covid positive, the Lucknow University Associated Colleges Teachers’ Association (LUACTA) chief urged the district administration to take action against the colleges not switching to online mode.
05-04-2021||Delhi||Delhi’s widest fountain to open near AIIMS next month||The widest fountain of Delhi-NCR, located near the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) flyover, is likely to be made operational from May onwards, officials of New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC), which is giving shape to the project, said.The fountain, which has already missed two deadlines, will be located near the steel sprouts on the lawns near the AIIMS flyover. The fountain is coming up in one of the two lawns located on either side of the busy Aurobindo Marg near AIIMS flyover and East Kidwai Nagar.According to NDMC officials, major construction work of the project has been completed, and only some finishing touches and landscaping work remained before the project is thrown open next month.A senior NDMC official associated with the project said that the fountain will be cascading and has been built around the large steel sprouts. It has a circumference of 90-metres thus making it the city’s widest fountain installed at a public place.“We have completed the construction work and are now testing the plumbing and lighting. Also, the work to improve the landscape with the use of ornamental and flowering plants and the grass is going on. These are all finishing touches and will be completed this month. We are planning to open the fountain from next month,” the NDMC official, said requesting anonymity.The official said that a request for the inauguration of the fountain will be sent to higher NDMC authorities later this month. “They will then decide the date of the opening ceremony,” he added.In one of the lawns facing the East Kidwai Nagar redevelopment project, a 35-foot-high steel artwork — comprising eight big stainless-steel sprouts — was installed in 2008. In the lawn opposite to it, 80 smaller sprouts were installed.Officials said that after the redevelopment of Kidwai Nagar, the landscape of the area has changed. So the civic body has decided to develop the area with the help of fountains, flowers, and decorative lightings.The project was planned in May 2018 and as per initial plans, the civic corporation was to dismantle the iconic steel sprouts near AIIMS to make space for the water fountain. A few months later, however, the Delhi Urban Art Commission (DUAC) rejected the proposal and directed the NDMC not to remove the steel sprouts. After that, the NDMC re-worked the design and decided to retain the sprouts.Officials said that the project was supposed to be completed by May 2020 but was delayed because of the Covid-19 pandemic. The deadline was then extended to January 2021, which again couldn’t be met because of labour shortage.“During the lockdown period, the work on the project had stopped completely. Work finally resumed in September last year, but then too progress remained very slow because of a shortage of labourers, many of whom had gone back to their hometowns. The project was fast-tracked towards the end of 2020 and is likely to be opened next month,” said a second NDMC official, associated with the project said.Neeraj Gupta, president Delhi Art Society, however, believed that improving the decor of an important with the help of a fountain was a bad idea. He said that the AIIMS roundabout is among the most important locations of the city and such places should be developed aesthetically with artwork in such a way so that every visitor felt connected to the city.“There are already a number of fountains in the city. Instead of constructing a large fountain here, authorities should have showcased Delhi’s history and its contribution to the country’s freedom struggle through modern art sculptures and other artworks. Artworks are like magnets, they draw the public and feel them connected to the area,” Gupta said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/citys-widest-fountain-to-open-near-aiims-next-month-101617561611955.html

Police on Friday evening arrested the key suspect and his two associates when they were on their way to meet the victim and pressurise him to withdraw the complaint registered against them, said police. Police said the three men shot twice at Mohammad Ahmad (28), who sustained an injury on his knee and will survive.  Ahmad lives with his family in Zakir Nagar and runs a general store on the ground floor of his building. On March 28, he noticed a young man, later identified as Salman alias Pollard, smoking right outside his building. “There was a heated exchange between them when Ahmad asked Salman to not smoke outside his building. Salman left, but soon returned with two men, Yasir and Danish,” said R P Meena, deputy commissioner of police (south-east). According to the DCP, Yasir and Danish are close associates of an alleged notorious gang leader, Taslimullah Khan, who has been on the run for a while. The duo is allegedly involved in murder, attempt to murder, kidnapping and arms cases, said police. Police said Salman and his two associates started abusing Ahmad and asked him to come out of his house. “When I came out to my balcony, one of them fired at me twice. One bullet missed me but the other hit me on the knee,” said Ahmad.Soon after the firings, the suspects fled the spot while Ahmad was rushed to AIIMS trauma centre in a PCR van.Subsequently, the police registered an attempt to murder case and scanned CCTV footage to identify the suspects. Police received information that the suspects fled to Darbhanga in Bihar to escape arrest. “We arrested them after receiving a tip-off that they were on their way to visit Ahmad to ask him to withdraw his case,” said the DCP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/shopkeeper-shot-at-for-objecting-to-man-s-smoking-3-held-101617561553523.html
05-04-2021||Delhi||Learning will be hit, say students who will take board exams next year||The Delhi government’s order to continue teaching-learning activities in online and semi-online mode for the new academic session in view of the rising number of Covid-19 cases in the city has left students of Class 10 and 12 worried.On Sunday, the city recorded over 4,033 cases with a positivity rate of 4.64%.Students said that the recent order by the government, will impact their board examination preparations for next year and leave them at a disadvantage.One such student, Vansh Arora, 15, a Class 10 student of The Indian School, said he too was looking forward to going to school as his seniors had been called back for practical classes and doubt-clearing sessions in January. However, the Delhi government latest circular, released on Thursday, left him “disappointed.”“Unstable internet connection leads to constant disruptions, which impacts our concentration. Our teachers are trying their best to use various technological tools, but offline classes are more suitable for senior classes. Besides, there is little clarity if we will have the entire syllabus to study or if the reduced syllabus introduced last year will continue,” he said.For government school students, the situation is more challenging as the final examinations of class 9 and 11 students are yet to take place — effectively meaning that they are yet to start their Class 10 and 12 lessons. Tanya Garg, 16, a student of Rajkiya Pratibha Vikas Vidyalaya, Shalimar Bagh, who will be appearing for her Class 11 final examination in May, said, “The classes in the previous years started in April. All my classmates are stressed because we will start our session in July this year and may have to cover the entire syllabus in a shorter duration of time, that too in online mode. I study using my smartphone and there are a lot of distractions during online classes. Offline classes would have helped students more.”A primary concern among several students is whether the syllabus rationalization that was introduced by the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) in July last year would continue. The CBSE, in order to mitigate academic losses caused by the Covid-19 pandemic and the ensuing lockdown, had reduced the syllabi of classes 9 to 12 by 30% for the academic session 2020-21, while retaining core concepts.Sanyam Bhardwaj, controller of examinations of CBSE, said, “The syllabus rationalisation was a one-time measure only for the extraordinary situation last year, which caused academic losses. Last year, people did not have the methodology to conduct classes. But this year, schools are better prepared to conduct online classes so there may not be academic losses. So as of now, the entire syllabus is in place.”Teachers at Delhi government schools are also concerned as many among their students would have to continue to rely on worksheets and WhatsApp lessons during a crucial academic year.Vandana Mittal, who has been teaching Mathematics in Class 10 at Sarvodaya co-ed Vidyalaya in Rohini Sector 8 for the last two decades, said the teachers will be forming new strategies to help students.“We have learnt something about the learning pattern of children in the last one year, even after they returned to school for two months. So the focus during online classes will be on core concepts, which we can explore once they come to school for offline lessons in a staggered manner. However, since we may have to cover the full syllabus, we expect the number of working days [in school lessons] to be more than last year. Otherwise, it will be difficult.”Jyoti Arora, principal of Mount Abu Public School in Rohini, also expressed concern for students starting their class 10 and 12 in the 2020-21 academic session. “For these children, contact with teachers, peers and regular classes has been limited for over a year. It is an area of concern, because these students need a few physical classes with their teachers even if it is in smaller batches and in a staggered manner.”Aprajita Gautam, president of Delhi Parents’ Association, however said it was better to hold online classes. “Most parents approve of the decision and are satisfied with the order considering the rising number of cases in the city,” she said.Lalit Kant, former head of the epidemiology and communicable diseases department in ICMR, said, “Younger children don’t get the illness but are spreading the infection. Children in adolescent and higher age groups are spreading infection and also getting ill and we need to be careful about them. If we open schools for higher classes, chances of spread can increase.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/learning-will-be-hit-say-students-who-will-take-board-exams-next-year-101617561552774.html

On Sunday, the authority demolished parts of a newly built six-floor building located at Barola in Sector 49 after it found out that the construction was done on a land identified as enemy property. Enemy property is owned by the government because it was of people who left it and chose to go to Pakistan during the 1947 Partition, authority officials said. “We are taking action against all kinds of buildings, which are being built in violation of laid down rules. We have demolished some parts of this building in Barola as it is being built in violation of norms,” said Santosh Kumar Upadhyay, officer on special duty, Noida authority.The authority has also decided to remove all nurseries operational across the city in violation of rules. “The crackdown against illegal nurseries will continue until we demolish all of them,” Upadhyay said. According to the authority, it has removed 15 nurseries built on government land in last one month and the 20 others will be removed in the next one month.“We have demolished 15 nurseries, which were operational on the government land with an intention to grab the land. Now, we will demolish another 20 nurseries, which are operational on private land not meant for commercial activities,” said another Noida authority official, not authorized to speak to media.The authority has also decided to demolish the structures, which are being constructed without any approval of the town planning department, the officials said.As far as the issue of building on enemy property in Barola is concerned, the authority has planned to demolish remaining part soon. “We have filed an FIR against those who have built this building on enemy property. We have also sealed it. Now, further action will be taken once we measure the area of land identified as enemy property,” said Upadhyay.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-authority-launches-crackdown-against-illegal-construction-activities-101617561131422.html

05-04-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh MC plans year-round drive to curb water wastage||Instead of the usual drive against water wastage during summers in Chandigarh, the municipal corporation is planning to extend it throughout the year.In view of an increase in water demand in summers, watering of lawns and washing of courtyards and vehicles with hosepipes are prohibited from April 15 to June 30 every year, and fine is imposed on the violators.Stating that the restricted drive does not make much sense, mayor Ravi Kant Sharma said: “Water wastage has to be curbed all year round, and not just in summers. Just like we impose fines for flouting of sanitation norms and for encroachments, fines for water wastage should also be imposed as and when the violation comes to light.” A Chandigarh Smart City Limited study last year revealed that 38% of water supplied to the city is wasted. The MC has been suffering huge losses due to such wastage every year. In 2019-2020, it spent ₹215 crore on water supply, but earned only ₹87 crore.“I will be calling a meeting of the engineering department officials on Monday to work out the implementation of the year-round imposition of the drive. The consumers should understand that water wastage is not acceptable in any season.”Get ready to pay up ₹5,000 from April 15Come April 15, the MC will be imposing a fine of ₹5,000 for water wastage. A repeat violation will lead to disconnection of water supply.The fine was increased from ₹2,000 through a notification on water tariff hike in September last year. However, in the MC General House’s recent resolution on rollback of the hike, the penalty was proposed to be decreased to ₹3,000. The administration has not taken any call on it yet.If the wastage is unintentional, such as leakage in pipe or water storage tank, the violator will be given a two-day notice to rectify the problem. In case of non-compliance, the fine will be imposed. However, if the wastage is intentional, such as washing of cars or watering of lawns, the challan will be issued on the spot, said an MC official, privy to the development. In case the fine is not paid, it will be added to the water bill. MC chief engineer Shailender Singh will be holding a meeting to finalise details of the drive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-mc-plans-year-round-drive-to-curb-water-wastage-101617561073050.html

05-04-2021||Kolkata||‘CM Banerjee fears losing Bengal polls, sought Sonia Gandhi’s help’: Adhir Chowdhury||West Bengal Congress president Adhir Chowdhury on Sunday said that chief minister Mamata Banerjee fears losing the assembly polls as well as the Nandigram seat in East Midnapore district. While addressing a campaign rally at Berhampore in Murshidabad district, Chowdhury said Banerjee has written a letter to UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi, seeking her help. “Mamata Banerjee has understood that she will face defeat. She has written a long letter to Sonia Gandhi, seeking her help. In the letter, the Trinamool Congress (TMC) chief has sought help from the Congress to stop the BJP from coming to power in Bengal,” said Chowdhury. On April 1, Banerjee contested the Nandigram seat against her aide-turned-adversary Suvendu Adhikari who reiterated on Sunday that he will win. Results of the eight-phased polls for the state’s 294 seats will be announced on May 2. The Congress is contesting the elections in alliance with the Left parties and cleric Abbasuddin Siddiqui’s Indian Secular Front. Chowdhury, who is a Lok Sabha member from Berhampore, said, “Didi (Banerjee) has understood that it is impossible for her to stop the BJP without help from the Congress. I would like to ask her to withdraw all TMC candidates in Murshidabad. She should raise a new slogan and ask people to vote for the Congress so that the BJP can be stopped.” There are 22 assembly seats in Murshidabad district.Also read: On Mamata’s Nandigram claims, EC replies ‘allegations factually incorrect’About a month ago, Congress Lok Sabha member from Malda (South), Abu Hashem Khan Chowdhury, said the Congress may help Banerjee if the TMC fails to secure the required numbers. Chowdhury reacted, saying it was not the official stand of the Bengal unit of the Congress.On Sunday, Chowdhury did not refer to any post-poll alliance. Congress leaders close to him, however, said the party’s central leadership might think of an alliance of opposition parties if the mandate turns out to be a fractured one.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/cm-banerjee-fear-losing-bengal-polls-sought-sonia-gandhi-s-help-adhir-chowdhury-101617550033545.html

Earlier, two tenders for 50,000 tonnes each had to be scrapped mainly due to high quotes.    Faced with production shortages, Pakistan is trying to import sugar in order to boost domestic availability and check retail prices which have shot up to PKR 100 per kg.   Last week, there was sudden hope of trade reopening between the two nations in sugar and cotton after Pakistan's Economic Coordination Committee allowed import of these two commodities from India. However, Pakistan's federal cabinet back-tracked on the decision.   Issuing a fresh international tender for import of 50,000 tonnes of white sugar, TCP made it clear to global suppliers that "the cargo (white sugar) should not be originated from Israel or any other banned country."   Global suppliers should submit bids by April 14 and deliver the commodity at any port in Karachi, it said.Commenting on the development, All India Sugar Trade Association (AISTA) Chairman Praful Vithalani said, "Bad luck for Pakistan. Will you get sugar at prices, quality and speed with lowest freight parity of Indian sugar?"For Pakistan, importing white sugar from India would have been much cheaper and faster via land route compared from other countries, he told PTI.   "Through land route via Punjab, white sugar would cost about USD 398 per tonne (which includes freight charges and delivery at godown)," he added.   According to AISTA, TCP had scrapped earlier two tenders for import of sugar because of high quotes. The lowest bid it received was around USD 540 per tonne by Al Khaleez, Dubai.   Pakistan, which is expecting sugar production of 5.6 million tonnes in the ongoing 2020-21 marketing year (October-September), is facing a shortage of 5,00,000 tonnes, according to Pakistani traders  Whereas India, the world's second largest sugar producing nation after Brazil, is sitting on a surplus stock and targeting to export 6 million tonnes in the ongoing 2020-21 marketing year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-issues-global-tender-for-import-of-50-000-tonnes-of-sugar-101617645067728.html

Health officials have said the country's vaccination effort could limit deaths even with rising cases.For a sixth week, vaccinations set a record, with an average of 3.1 million shots given per day last week. As of Sunday, 32% of the US population has received at least one dose and 19% was fully vaccinated, according to the CDC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-hospitalizations-cases-continue-to-rise-in-us-for-third-straight-week-101617644346042.html

He also asked people to get tested even in the lack of Covid-19 symptoms."We can't be complacent. We can see the waves of sickness affecting other countries and we have seen how this story goes. We still don't know how strong the vaccine shield will be when cases begin to rise as I am afraid that they will and that's why we are saying please get your vaccine or second dose when your turn comes, and please use the free NHS tests even if you don't feel ill," he said.According to the latest update by Johns Hopkins University, the UK has recorded 4,376,560 total infections and 1,27,104 deaths.More than 31.4 million people have been given the first jab of the coronavirus vaccine, according to the official figures reported by Xinhua.On February 22, Johnson had announced his roadmap for exiting the lockdown, the third of its kind since the start of the pandemic. The four-step plan is expected to see all legal restrictions in England being removed by mid-June.Experts have warned Britain is "still not out of the woods" amid concerns over new variants and the third wave of the pandemic in the European continent, Xinhua reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-to-move-to-phase-two-of-roadmap-to-exit-covid-19-lockdown-101617644108484.html

Trump, a Republican, left office in January, replaced by Democratic President Joe Biden.With Trump no longer president, the justices declined to hear arguments and resolve the case on the merits, tossing out the 2nd Circuit decision.Throughout his presidency, Trump had regularly used Twitter to promote his agenda and attack detractors. Twitter banned Trump from its service days after a mob of his supporters attacked the US Capitol in a deadly riot on January 6.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-supreme-court-brings-end-to-donald-trump-s-moot-twitter-fight-101617632092409.html

Earlier, demonstrators with placards of Suu Kyi and signs calling for international intervention marched through the second-biggest city Mandalay, images posted on social media showed.Brunei, chair of the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), threw its support on Monday behind a regional leaders' meeting to discuss Myanmar.After talks between Malaysian Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin and Brunei Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah, Brunei said both countries had asked their ministers and officials to make the "necessary preparations for the meeting that will be held at the ASEAN Secretariat in Jakarta, Indonesia."No date was given.ASEAN operates by consensus, but the divergent views of its members on how to respond to the Myanmar army's crackdown on civilians and the group's policy of non-interference has limited its ability to act.Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines and Singapore have all expressed alarm over the killings of demonstrators and support an urgent high-level meeting on Myanmar. Besides Brunei, the other ASEAN members are Myanmar itself, Thailand, Laos, Vietnam and Cambodia.The United States and other Western countries have denounced the coup and called for the release of Suu Kyi, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991 for her campaign against military rule. She has been charged with violating an official secrets act that is punishable by up to 14 years in prison.Junta rebuts UN envoyThe junta said on Monday that comments last week by UN Special Envoy Christine Schraner Burgener about an impending "bloodbath" in Myanmar were inaccurate and misleading."Ms. Burgener's remarks contravene the basic principles of sovereignty, and the fact that the United Nations is meant to work towards peace and stability of the world's nations," it said in a notice in the state-run Global New Light of Myanmar newspaper.Schraner Burgener told the 15-member U.N. Security Council on March 31 that it must consider "potentially significant action" to reverse the course of events as "a bloodbath is imminent," according to comments published by U.N. News.The junta said the remarks were a "a far cry from reality and could delay and destabilise the efforts by the State Administration Council to establish a genuine and disciplined multiparty democracy".The coup and subsequent crackdown has led to Western sanctions on the military and its lucrative businesses.Fitch Solutions said on Monday that a conservative forecast for Myanmar's economy would be for a 20% contraction in the fiscal year that began in October, instead of the 2% seen before the coup.External pressure is growing on the military to stop the violence, with some countries calling for it to cede power and free all detainees, and others urging dialogue and new elections soon.A total of 2,667 people have been detained under the junta, the Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP) activist group said on Monday.The junta at the weekend announced arrest warrants for about 60 celebrities, social media influencers, models and musicians on charges of incitement.The military, which ruled with an iron first for half a century until 2011, has also seen fighting with armed ethnic minorities reignite on at least two fronts, raising fears of growing conflict and chaos in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-protesters-clap-to-denounce-junta-as-region-focuses-on-crisis-101617627219093.html

He has described himself as the victim of a politically motivated witch-hunt.Meanwhile, Israeli President Reuven Rivlin began consulting with party heads on who might form the next coalition government - a toss-up after the March 23 election, the fourth in two years, gave neither Netanyahu nor his rivals a clear mandate.Rivlin told delegates from Netanyahu's conservative Likud party that ethical considerations could factor in his decision, apparently alluding to Netanyahu's trial."I do not see a way in which a government can be established," Rivlin told representatives of centrist Yesh Atid, the largest opposition party, which hopes to unseat Netanyahu."The people of Israel should be very concerned that we may be dragged into a fifth election."At Jerusalem District Court, prosecuters sought to establish that Netanyahu granted regulatory favors to Israel's leading telecommunications company, Bezeq Telecom Israel BEZQ.TA, in return for more positive coverage of him and his wife Sara on a company news website known as Walla.Former Walla CEO Ilan Yeshua testified that he had been "barraged" by emailed and text message demands, from both the Walla owners and Netanyahu confidants, to improve reporting on the prime minister while playing down or attacking his political rivals."How much can you lie?" Iris Elovitch, wife of Walla's owner at the time and a co-defendant in Case 4000, shouted at Yeshua.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/netanyahus-favours-were-currency-prosecutor-says-as-corruption-trial-starts-101617619396869.html

The total number of new Covid-19 infections, including imported infections originating from overseas, stood at 32, marking the highest total since Jan. 31.Genetic analysis of the cases discovered in Ruili suggest the new local infections stem from viruses imported from Myanmar, state media reported. Of the new patients reported in the city, 11 of them were identified as Myanmar citizens.Ruili is a key transit point for Yunnan province, which has struggled to monitor its rugged 4,000 km (2,500-mile) border with Laos, Myanmar and Vietnam for illegal immigration amid a wave of unauthorised crossings last year by people seeking a haven from the pandemic.On Monday evening, city authorities announced three high risk and six medium risk areas in Ruili as of 7pm local time (1100 GMT), reported state broadcaster CCTV.CCTV also reported that Ruili would conduct a second testing drive round from April 6 onwards, and that residents who had visited Jiegaoyu City, a jade market in one of the high risk areas, between March 15 and 29 would need to be quarantined at home.Local authorities have also began a vaccination drive in Ruili in a bid to contain Covid-19 and build up herd immunity in the city.The number of new asymptomatic cases, which China does not classify as confirmed cases, stood at 18, matching the total from a day earlier.The total number of confirmed Covid-19 cases in mainland China now stands at 90,305, while the death toll remains unchanged at 4,636.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-reports-biggest-daily-covid-19-case-jump-in-over-2-months-101617625685767.html

Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin asked police to look into the claims.The prosecutor's office said Monday that the investigation is continuing despite reports that the man featured in the documentary had retracted his claim.French restaurants have been closed since October to slow the spread of the coronavirus virus. France just entered a new partial lockdown in response to intensive care units again filling with Covid-19 patients.Government spokesman Gabriel Attal said on LCI television Sunday night that authorities have been investigating reports of clandestine parties and restaurants for months, and 200 suspects have been identified and face “heavy punishment.”Government ministers “have a duty to be totally irreproachable and exemplary.” Attal said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-amid-covid-19-restrictions-ministers-accused-of-dining-at-secret-restaurants-101617622656140.html

But as friction has grown this year over the arrest and jailing of Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny, it has signalled a tougher line.Russia has since March impeded the speed of Twitter for not removing content it deems illegal, and threatened to block it entirely. Photos and videos take longer to load for some users.However, in a statement on Monday, state communications watchdog Roskomnadzor said Twitter had held talks with Russian authorities on April 1, resulting in an agreement to give it more time and a recognition that banned content was being deleted quicker.On average, Twitter was removing illegal content within 81 hours of receiving a request, the watchdog said in statement. That is still much longer than the 24 hours demanded in law.Twitter did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Russian authorities have accused Twitter and others this year of failing to delete posts that Moscow said illegally urged children to take part in anti-Kremlin protests.Roskomnadzor says it wants Twitter to delete content that contains child pornography, drug abuse information and calls for minors to commit suicide.Twitter denies allowing its platform to be used to promote illegal behaviour, says its has a zero-tolerance policy for child sexual exploitation and prohibits the promotion of suicide or self-harm.After Russia announced the move to slow down its traffic, Twitter said it was worried about the impact on free speech.As well as Russia, major social media companies have been embroiled in an increasing number of disputes around the globe as governments seek to curb their power.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-extends-punitive-twitter-slowdown-until-midmay-101617617388604.html

It comes as the government announced plans for twice weekly free coronavirus tests for everyone in England to be rolled out from the end of this week."One of the things we don't want to see – and just as the vaccination programme is working so well – is getting new variants or risking new variants getting imported into this country," UK health minister Edward Argar told the BBC, in reference to the "very cautious" next phase of lifting lockdown restrictions.As part of the announcements, Johnson is expected to lay out details of trial events in the coming months that will explore how ventilation and testing before and after events could help audiences back into arenas and auditoriums – over a year after being shut down to control the spread of the deadly virus.The pilot schemes involving what is being dubbed as "Covid-status certification" will include the football FA Cup final at Wembley Stadium in London and are expected to involve a smartphone app or a paper certificate.The trials will last until mid-May, when the next phase of lockdown easing is scheduled before a complete easing of restrictions by June 21 under Johnson's roadmap.According to the BBC, the first pilot event will be a comedy night in Liverpool on April 16, where audience members will be tested for COVID before and after the show.However, critics of these plans, including more than 40 parliamentarians from Johnson’s Conservative Party and privacy campaigners, have suggested that such COVID passports could prove counter-productive.Downing Street has also indicated that ministers are finalising plans to allow overseas travel through a traffic light system approach, with countries designated as red, amber and green based on their COVID risk levels.Non-essential international travel remains banned under current lockdown rules and the government advice continues to go against booking any overseas trips for summer holidays at this stage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-passports-travel-traffic-lights-in-boris-johnson-s-unlock-plan-for-uk-101617617425537.html

Some claimed the disease had not killed anyone in their camps, raising concerns about a lack of awareness of the virus among the refugee population, Arab News reported.At least 1.4 million Afghan refugees live in 54 camps across the country, mostly in the northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and southwestern Balochistan provinces, both of which border Afghanistan. Refugee settlements are also located in large urban centres like Karachi and Islamabad.Islamabad bars them from purchasing property, vehicles, and even SIM cards. They cannot attend public schools or universities. Hospitals often refuse to admit expectant Afghan mothers because they cannot issue birth certificates to the newborns. The refugees live each day with the looming threat of being deported to a country they have never set foot in.By most estimates, around a million more immigrants live there without proper documentation. Islamabad bars them from purchasing property, vehicles, and even SIM cards.They cannot attend public schools or universities. Hospitals often refuse to admit expectant Afghan mothers because they cannot issue birth certificates to the newborns. The refugees live each day with the looming threat of being deported to a country they have never set foot in.In 2017, the Human Rights Watch issued a report claiming that Pakistan has turned on the Afghan community. In response to several deadly security incidents and deteriorating political relations between Pakistan and Afghanistan, Pakistani authorities have mounted a concerted campaign to drive Afghans out of the country, the report noted."No one has contacted us for vaccinations," Zahir Pashtun, a youth activist at the New Saranan refugee camp in southwestern Balochistan province, told Arab News."I do not think that even one per cent (of refugees) will get the jab," he said, adding: "Some are even convinced they will die if they get immunised."Zahir said the virus had not killed anyone in his refugee camp but had severely damaged the financial conditions of the most daily wage labourers in his community, as the virus had wreaked havoc on the economy since last March.In Pashtun's camp, a worker said the government should give refugees money instead of vaccinations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dont-need-covid-19-vaccines-give-us-money-afghan-refugees-to-pak-govt-101617617381843.html
05-04-2021||World||Covid mutants multiply as scientists race to decode variations||When Bette Korber, a biologist at Los Alamos National Laboratory, spotted the first significant mutation in the Covid-19 virus last spring, some scientists were skeptical. They didn’t believe it would make the virus more contagious and said its rapid rise might just be coincidence.Now, 11 months later, the D614G mutation she helped discover is ubiquitous worldwide, featured in the genomes of fast-spreading variants from the U.K., South Africa and Brazil. Meanwhile, new mutations are popping up in increasingly complicated patterns, spurring a drive by top biologists to devise new ways to track a fire hose of incoming genomic data.The goal: Quickly detect variants that can lessen the effectiveness of vaccines for a pathogen that’s unlikely to be eradicated any time soon. The SARS-CoV-2 virus could settle down and become a mere nuisance like the common cold. Or much like influenza, it could retain its ability to cause severe disease in some segments of the population, a scenario that could require regular booster shots.“By watching it carefully, we can stay ahead of the virus and that is what everyone is scrambling to do right now,” said Korber, who is working to create new mathematical tools for spotting medically significant variants.The flood of new genome data is so great that the Los Alamos lab had to upgrade its servers to deal with the incoming data. Meanwhile, Korber is on four Zoom calls a week with experts worldwide to devise criteria for deciding when mutations are concerning enough to merit detailed laboratory follow-up on how they may impact vaccines.A key mystery plumbed early-on by top scientists has been what type of virus the coronavirus will prove to be. So far, it looks more similar to influenza, which shape-shifts all the time and requires annual revaccination, than it does measles, a virus so intolerant of mutation that one vaccine regimen lasts a lifetime.“Does it mean we need to make a new vaccine every year?” said Paul Duprex, who heads the University of Pittsburgh’s Center for Vaccine Research. ”We don’t know.”For one thing, mRNA vaccines for Covid-19 have efficacy rates above 90%, much higher than the 60% rate for flu shots in a good year. But vaccine makers Moderna Inc. and Pfizer Inc., along with its partner BioNTech SE, aren’t taking any chances. Just in case, they’re already starting trials of booster shots aimed at B.1.351, the antibody-evading strain first spotted in South Africa.When viruses replicate and copy their genomes, errors can erupt the long string of RNA or DNA “letters” that determine how viral proteins are developed. Many of the errors have no effect, or they can even make the virus less fit. But a tiny percentage of these changes can give the virus an advantage, making it more infectious or giving it the ability to evade the immune system.The HIV virus is notorious for its rapid mutation rate. In comparison, SARS-CoV-2 mutates at a much slower rate, partly due to a proof-reading enzyme that limits changes. But with more than 125 million infections worldwide, some errors are bound to slip through.At the same time, the virus has found devious ways that may avoid its proof-reading mechanism, University of Pittsburgh researchers have found. Rather than making changes in individual RNA letters, it deletes groups of several letters at a time, apparently undercutting the ability of the virus’s natural spell-check systems to see the change.74-Day BoutSome of the first deletions were seen in an immunocompromised cancer patient treated at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center who died after a 74-day bout with Covid-19. In that time, multiple immune-escaping deletions developed, according to the University of Pittsburgh’s Duprex, who reported on the cancer patient’s deletions in November.“If the damn thing is gone you are not going to be able to fix it,” Duprex said.What makes SARS-CoV-2’s future so hard to predict is that viral evolution is like a three dimensional chess game. It’s not just the individual mutations that matter, but also the order and combinations in which they occur. A single mutation may alter the virus in subtle ways that change the impact of others down the line, according to Mark Zeller, a scientist at the Scripps Research Institute in San Diego.Shared MutationsBoth the B.1.351 strain common in South Africa and the P.1 strain that’s battering Brazil share several mutations in the spike protein that the virus uses to gain entry into cells. This includes the D614G mutation discovered by Korber, which makes the spike more stable, and the E484K mutation, which is thought to reduce the ability of some antibodies to bind to the spike.Yet so far, for reasons not fully understood, it’s the B.1.351 that’s appears to have more impact on Pfizer’s and Moderna’s vaccines, at least in laboratory tests.Overall, the track record for eliminating viruses has been poor, with smallpox being the main example. Even pockets of polio are still around in some countries, despite efforts to eliminate it. That doesn’t bode well for the current virus, according to Jesse Bloom, a researcher at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center who studies viral evolution.“Vaccination is going to take the edge off this pandemic in a very substantial way,” Bloom said. “But I don’t think we are going to eradicate SARS-CoV-2.”Bloom predicts it will take “a number of years” for the virus to acquire enough mutations to fully escape existing vaccines. Of the roughly 100,000 possible single letter mutations for the virus, fewer than 1% are likely to help the virus evade antibodies, he said.A Hopeful ScenarioWhile the virus continues to evolve in the short term, one of the most hopeful scenarios is that it may run out of big moves it can make to evade antibodies that make the current vaccines work. Under this scenario, there may be a practical limit to how much the virus can mutate and remain fit to invade our cells.The spike protein must retain a shape that allows it to efficiently latch to its human receptor, according to Shane Crotty, a researcher at the La Jolla Institute for Immunology.“There is not an infinite number of possibilities,” he said. “It is like putting your foot in a shoe. It still has to be basically the right shape and size and it still has to be recognizable as a shoe.”Still, evidence from other common cold coronaviruses indicates they can mutate to evade the immune system over time.In a recent study, Bloom and his colleagues compared the 1984 version of a common cold coronavirus called 229E to a version of the same strain that circulated in 2016, three decades later. Fully 17% of RNA letters in a key part of the spike protein that binds the virus to cells had been swapped out due to mutations.To test what this meant for human immunity, they obtained patient blood samples from the 1980s that could neutralize the 1984 viral strain. These people likely had been exposed to the 1984 virus and developed protective antibodies against it.Faded ProtectionsWhen the researchers tested the samples against strains of the 229E virus that appeared in the 1990s or later, the protection had faded: Only 2 of 8 blood samples were able to neutralize the 2016 strain, and those two showed vastly reduced activity against the most recent virus.That provides some hints for how much could change in the future, given enough time. “It’s pretty clear that human coronaviruses undergo substantial antigenic evolution,” Bloom said in an interview.However, it remains unknown whether the virus can retain its ability to cause severe disease as it mutates and more people gain immunity through infections or vaccines.In research published in January in the journal Science, disease modelers at Emory University found that a key factor will be whether protection against severe illness lasts significantly longer than protection against mild or asymptomatic reinfections, something that’s typical of coronaviruses that cause common colds.While the study was done before the current variants emerged, its basic conclusions hold up, according to Jennie S. Lavine, a postdoctoral researcher at Emory University.“What we see with Covid-19 on a molecular and cellular level is not inconsistent with what we see with endemic coronaviruses,” said Lavine, who was the paper’s lead author. “Immunity wanes, but not all of it wanes fast.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-mutants-multiply-as-scientists-race-to-decode-variations-101617614473774.html
05-04-2021||World||China warns US not to take 'superior' position on global affairs||Amid rising tensions between the US and China over a slew of issues, Beijing has warned Washington not to take a superior position and presume it has a final say on global affairs.Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi said China would not accept a list from Washington of unilateral demands for negotiations with Beijing. "The door for dialogue with China is open. But the dialogue should be done on an equal basis and with mutual respect," he said."China will not accept that there is any nation in the world that [can] put itself superior to the others, and that any nation will have a final say on world affairs. If the US continues to confront, China will take it calmly without fear."Wang said, while China-US cooperation was possible, both sides should respect each other's core concerns, and China would not accept unilateral demands and conditions from Washington, South China Morning Post reported."We resolutely resist gross interference in China's internal affairs, and even more resolutely oppose unlawful unilateral sanctions imposed on the basis of lies and false information," he said.Diplomatic observers said Beijing was looking to improve ties with the US that had been badly damaged under former US President Donald Trump, but was facing a dilemma overdrawing a line between cooperation and resisting US pressure.Following the Alaska summit, the relations between China and the US have deteriorated and tensions have escalated.Washington slapped additional sanctions on Chinese officials and entities over alleged human rights violations in Xinjiang, following a similar move by the European Union. Both countries have also stepped up their military presence in the disputed East and South China Seas.Wang said China and the US should hold more dialogues on regional affairs and cooperate on the pandemic but added that the rise of China could not be overturned."It is inevitable for China to continue development and becoming strong. This is in line with the long-term interest and common aspiration of regional countries, and this trend cannot be resisted," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-warns-us-not-to-take-superior-position-on-global-affairs-101617612758953.html
05-04-2021||World||Japan fears Covid-19 variants are behind possible fourth wave||Japanese health authorities are concerned that variants of the coronavirus are driving a nascent fourth wave in the pandemic with just 109 days remaining until the Tokyo Olympics.The variants appear to be more infectious and may be resistant to vaccines, which are still not widely available in Japan. The situation is worst in Osaka, where infections hit fresh records last week, prompting the regional government to start targeted lockdown measures for one month from Monday.A mutant Covid-19 variant first discovered in Britain has taken hold in the Osaka region, spreading faster and filling up hospital beds with more serious cases than the original virus, according to Koji Wada, a government adviser on the pandemic."The fourth wave is going to be larger," said Wada, a professor at Tokyo's International University of Health and Welfare. "We need to start to discuss how we could utilize these targeted measures for the Tokyo area."Japan has twice declared a state of emergency that covered most of the country in the past year, most recently just after New Year as the pandemic's third and most deadly wave struck. Officials are now opting for more targeted measures that allow local governments to shorten business hours and impose fines for noncompliance.Osaka cancelled Olympic Torch relay events there, but Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga has insisted Japan will carry out the Games as scheduled. Suga said on Sunday that measures employed in Osaka could be expanded to Tokyo and elsewhere if needed.There were 249 new infections in Tokyo on Monday, still well below the peak of over 2,500 in January. In Osaka, a record 666 cases were reported on Saturday.The true extent of the mutant cases is unknown, as only a small fraction of positive Covid-19 cases undergo the genomic study necessary to find the variants.A health ministry report last week showed 678 cases of mutant variants from Britain, South Africa, and Brazil had been discovered nationwide and at airports, with the biggest clusters in Osaka and nearby Hyogo prefecture.But another strain, known as E484K, may be more widespread. Around 70% of coronavirus patients tested at a Tokyo hospital last month carried the mutation that was different from the British and South African varieties, Japanese public broadcaster NHK said on Sunday.The rebound in cases came within weeks of the government lifting state of emergency measures, and the priority measures being rolled out now are intended to halt an unexpected rise in mutant cases, said Makoto Shimoaraiso, a Cabinet Secretariat official for Japan's Covid-19 response."We take the criticism when people say that we have not been able to detect any variants," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-fears-covid-19-variants-are-behind-possible-fourth-wave-101617612238493.html
05-04-2021||World||New coronavirus variant 'Eek' found in Japan, lowers vaccine protection||As the coronavirus continues to mutate, a new variant, nicknamed 'Eek' by scientists, has now emerged in Japan, news agency Reuters reported on Sunday. Citing Japan's public broadcaster NHK, the agency reported that the new E484K mutation, known for reducing vaccine protection, was detected in around 70% of the coronavirus disease patients at a Tokyo hospital last month.According to the NHK report, reviewed by Reuters, the E484K mutation was found in as many as 10 out of 14 Covid-19 patients at the Tokyo Medical and Dental University Hospital, back in March. For two months, 12 of 36 Covid-19 patients carried the mutation, but none of them had recently travelled abroad or reported contact with people who had, the report said.Variants of the coronavirus have cropped up around the world since last year. Japan is presently grappling with a fresh wave of coronavirus infections, a worrying trend ahead of the summer Tokyo Olympics planned for July. On Sunday, 355 new infections were reported in Tokyo, although that is still well below the peak of over 2,500 in January. A total of 594 new coronavirus disease cases were reported in Osaka prefecture on Sunday, a day after a record 666 were confirmed.Also Read: Covid-19: Japan to expand emergency measures as needed amid fears of new strainsAlthough large-scale vaccinations of the general population have not yet begun, health experts are particularly worried about the spread of mutant strains, Reuters reported, adding that hospital officials were not immediately available for comment.Japan's prime minister Yoshihide Suga said on Sunday that he would expand emergency measures as needed to contain the new wave of coronavirus infections, amid fears over the spread of virus mutations. Asked on a Fuji TV programme whether Tokyo might be added to a list of areas set to come under lockdown, Suga simply said, "All possibilities are being considered. It doesn't matter specifically where, we will act without hesitation if needed."(With inputs from Reuters)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-coronavirus-variant-eek-found-in-japan-lowers-vaccine-protection-101617601060352.html

05-04-2021||World||Thailand households struggle with record debt, Covid-19 increases burden||Thai farmer Jamras Kongchai is struggling to pay off 500,000 baht ($16,082) in debt as money from the sale of her crops is not enough to make payments.Adding to the strain, the coronavirus outbreak has shut a small construction firm where she worked for $10 a day for much needed extra income."I'm so heavily indebted and don't know what to do," said the 51-year-old, single mother of two, who travelled from the northern province of Kamphaeng Phet to join a demonstration of indebted rice growers in Bangkok late last month, asking the government to help reduce their debt burden.Jamras has only repaid some of the interest since 2013, and hasn't put a dent in the principle. This year, she has to pay 40,000 baht in interest, but she has no money. "I hope to get some help".Such protests have put further pressure on the Thai government, which is already grappling with mounting pro-democracy demonstrations and struggling to revive the pandemic-hit economy.Thai households are among the biggest borrowers in Asia, racking up a debt mountain of 14 trillion baht, or 89.3% of gross domestic product (GDP) by the end of December, a sharp rise from 78.1% in 2017. And, they are finding it increasingly difficult to keep up with payments.The level of household debt is the highest since the central bank began keeping records in 2003.High debt also poses a risk to financial stability and restrains consumer spending in Southeast Asia’s second-largest economy, impeding a recovery from the coronavirus crisis. The economy suffered its deepest slump in over two decades last year as exports shrank and the vital tourism sector reeled from the absence of foreign visitors.New COVID-19 outbreaks have added to the pressure on some businesses and households, the central bank said last month, when it cut its 2021 gross domestic product (GDP) growth outlook to 3% from 3.2%, noting the economy would not return to pre-pandemic levels until mid-2022.While the latest flareup in infections has been largely contained, it has reinforced fears that an economic rebound will be slow and patchy, prolonging the pain."Even before COVID, our debt to GDP was already the highest among emerging markets," said Yunyong Thaicharoen, chief economist at Siam Commercial bank."It's above a level that has quite an impact on GDP and household spending," he said, adding the debt ratio could peak at 90-91% of GDP in the first quarter.The government has promised 1 trillion baht in relief to ease the impact of the outbreak, but some say relief is not being rolled out fast enough for many Thais. Last year, a woman took rat poison outside the finance ministry to protest the slow response. She survived and was promised her payment days later.DEBT MOUNTAINThe growing debt burden is likely to curb private consumption, which accounts for half of Thailand's $502 billion GDP, and will hurt lenders' earnings if more loans turn sour.To be sure, the pandemic slowed down loan demand last year, but the slumping economy also made it more difficult for people to repay their loans.Consumer loans rose 4.6% last year, slowing from a 7.5% rise in 2019 as the outbreak cut household purchasing power, according to the central bank.But loans with a significant increase in credit risk jumped, with autos loans hitting 9.5% of lending, the highest in at least three years.Still, lender Muangthai Capital, remains upbeat, targeting annual loan growth of 20-25% over the next four years."The industry still has ample room to grow", said deputy managing director Parithad Petampai, noting the firm’s lending increased 10-fold to 70 billion baht last year from 2014.For years, easy credit for consumers and businesses has prompted many warnings about the dangers of rising household debt in Thailand, and now the pandemic has left millions of people out of work.About 4.7 million workers are at risk of being affected by the outbreak, of which 1.2 million workers might become unemployed or underemployed, the central bank said in January.Even after the economy has recovered and more jobs are available, the debt overhang will take a long time to tackle."We may earn more but that will go to debt servicing, not much left to spend," said Aree Onkloi, 22, worker from the northern province of Phitsanulok, whose family owes nearly a million baht."We will have to keep borrowing and never get out of it".($1 = 31.09 baht)(Reporting by Orathai Sriring, Satawasin Staporncharnchai and additional reporting by Kitiphong Thaichareon,; Editing by Kay Johnson and Kim Coghill)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thailand-households-struggle-with-record-debt-covid-19-increases-burden-101617580471882.html
05-04-2021||World||Colombia to extend Covid-19 restrictions as cases rise||Colombia will extend coronavirus restrictions based on intensive care unit occupancy rates, President Ivan Duque said on Sunday, amid rising case numbers.The Andean country, which has recorded more than 2.4 million coronavirus cases and nearly 64,000 deaths, has so far administered nearly 2.4 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines.The government has repeatedly warned people not lower their guard during the Easter holidays - traditionally a popular travel period - and put in place weekend curfews."It's clear that ... some municipalities have shown increases in recent weeks and there also exists the risk of a new national increase in the coming weeks," Duque said in remarks broadcast on social media. "We must act, prevent and take appropriate decisions."Capital Bogotá and the cities of Manizales, Armenia, Tunja, Barranquilla, Monteria, Leticia and Pereira are under observation for increasing cases and deaths, Duque said, while Medellin, Cali, Santa Marta and Barranquilla are also being watched for decreasing intensive care unit capacity.Curfews based on ICU capacity will be in place from Monday and continue through April 19, he said.Cities with an ICU occupancy of above 85% will have a curfew from 6 p.m. through 5 a.m., while those with between 80% and 85% capacity will have curfews beginning at 8 p.m.Curfews will start at 10 p.m. for cities with between 70% and 79% occupancy, while those with between 50% and 69% will be restricted from midnight until 5 a.m.Bogota, the country's largest city, had ICU occupancy rates of 65.5% as of Saturday evening. Coastal cities including Caribbean port Barranquilla had rates hovering around 90%.Shopping and other activities will be regulated by ID numbers, Duque added.Those who travelled over the holiday to areas with high contagion should self-isolate for at least seven days upon returning home, Duque added.Colombia held a gradually loosened five-month national lockdown between March and September of last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/colombia-to-extend-covid-19-restrictions-as-cases-rise-101617579786973.html

People have been asked not to move out from their homes from 6 pm to 6 am, the report said.The decision was taken in light of the current situation in the country where the rate of infections and deaths have increased in recent weeks. The government has said that they are increasing the number of Covid-19-designated hospitals and ICU beds to deal with the rising number of patients, it said.Bangladesh has registered 7,087 fresh Covid-19 cases, taking the tally to 637,364, in the last 24 hours until Sunday which is the highest number of infections since the start of the pandemic, the United News of Bangladesh reported.Besides, the deaths due to coronavirus rose to 9,266 with 53 news fatalities during this period. The mortality rate fell to 1.45 on Sunday from Saturday's 1.46 per cent.All public transport services (roads, river, railway and domestic flights) were suspended and only emergency services remained operational.However, all government/non-government/autonomous offices, courts and private offices will be able to facilitate the commute of their employees to work using their own transport on a limited scale.Thousands of people left Dhaka on Sunday fearing getting trapped during the lockdown. Most of the people who left were unemployed or in poverty.Many shop owners and employees have, however, taken to the streets protesting the government's decision to shut down all shopping malls and markets during the weeklong lockdown, the Dhaka Tribune reported.Several hundred traders staged their demonstrations in Dhaka's New Market area blocking the road.This the second time lockdown has been imposed in Bangladesh. The country earlier imposed a 66-day lockdown from March 26 to May 30 last year when a nationwide holiday was also enforced.Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina urged people to help curb the spread of the virus in a speech in Parliament.“I know everyone will face difficulties. Despite this, I say lives should be given preference over everything,” Hasina said Sunday.Hasina has sought everyone's cooperation to combat the ongoing second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic in Bangladesh.Speaking on the new strain of coronavirus in the country, the premier said: “The damage done by the new virus variant is hard to detect right away.

The ferry sank just after it departed from the industrial Narayanganj district about 20 kms (12 mies) from Dhaka, to Munshiganj, said Mustain Billah, Narayanganj district administrator."Most of the bodies were found inside the sunken boat after it was dragged to the bank," he said, adding a few still could be missing.Police and officials said some of the passengers managed to swim ashore.Relatives gathered at the river bank to search for their loved ones. Rescuers, including divers from the fire brigade, were searching for survivors on Monday while salvage operations were hampered by a storm last night.The boat was packed with people rushing to leave the city after the government announced a week-long nationwide lockdown from Monday to tackle a spike in Covid-19 cases.Bangladesh reported a record daily jump of 7,087 coronavirus infections on Sunday, taking its total number of cases to 637,364 with 9,266 deaths.Hundreds of people die each year in ferry accidents in Bangladesh, a low-lying country that has extensive inland waterways but lax safety standards.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bangladesh-ferry-accident-kills-at-least-26-101617610246899.html

He said he was speaking over satellite Internet, but expected that service to be cut as well. The BBC says it received the statement from Hamzah's lawyer.In the statement, Hamzah said he had been informed he was being punished for taking in part in meetings in which the king had been criticized, though he himself was not accused of being a direct critic.He said he told the army chief: “I am not the person responsible for the breakdown in governance, for the corruption and for the incompetence that has been prevalent in our governing structure for the last 15 to 20 years and has been getting worse by the year. I am not responsible for the lack of faith that people have in their institutions. They are responsible.”The country's top general had earlier denied that Hamzah — a former crown prince stripped of the title in 2004 — was arrested or under house arrest, even as authorities announced the arrests of former senior officials close to the ruling monarchy.Hamzah was asked to “stop some movements and activities that are being used to target Jordan's security and stability,” said Gen. Yousef Huneiti, the army chief of staff.He said an investigation was ongoing and its results would be made public “in a transparent and clear form.”“No one is above the law and Jordan’s security and stability are above all,” he told the official Petra news agency.Petra had earlier reported that two senior officials who formerly worked for the palace, along with other suspects, had been arrested for “security reasons,” without providing further details.The Petra report said Sharif Hassan bin Zaid, a member of the royal family, and Bassem Ibrahim Awadallah, a former head of the royal court, were detained. Awadallah, also previously served as planning minister and finance minister and has private business interests throughout the Gulf region.The agency did not provide further details or name the others who were arrested.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/jordans-prince-hamzah-says-he-won-t-obey-orders-audio-recording-101617609208682.html
05-04-2021||World||Israel PM Netanyahu's trial resumes as parties weigh in on his fate||Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's corruption trial is to resume Monday as the country's political parties weigh in on whether he should form the next government after a closely divided election or step down to focus on his legal woes.Netanyahu is Israel's longest-serving prime minister and has clung to power through four hard-fought elections in less than two years, even as he has faced allegations of bribery, fraud and breach of trust. The March 23 election was largely a referendum on his leadership but produced no clear verdict.Israel's political parties will begin meeting with President Reuven Rivlin later on Monday to recommend which candidate should be tasked with forming the next government.Neither Netanyahu's allies nor his foes secured a governing majority in the Knesset, Israel's parliament. So his fate could come down to Naftali Bennett, a right-wing former ally with whom he has strained ties, and Mansour Abbas, the leader of a small Arab Islamist party who also has yet to commit to either the pro- or anti-Netanyahu blocs.Netanyahu will meanwhile appear in Jerusalem District Court for the start of the evidentiary stage of his trial.Netanyahu is charged with accepting bribes, fraud and breach of trust in three cases. The first involves Netanyahu allegedly receiving gifts worth hundreds of thousands of dollars from wealthy friends, including Hollywood film producer Arnon Milchan and Australian billionaire James Packer. In the second case, Netanyahu is accused of trying to orchestrate positive coverage in a major Israeli paper in exchange for curbing distribution of a free pro-Netanyahu tabloid.The third, dubbed Case 4000, which will be the focus of Monday’s first witness testimony, alleges that Netanyahu backed legislation worth hundreds of millions of dollars to the owner of Israeli telecom giant Bezeq in return for positive coverage on its news site Walla.Netanyahu has denied any wrongdoing, dismissing the charges against him as part of a media and law enforcement “witch hunt” to unseat him. His trial began last year and could last for another two years.In January, prosecutors alleged 315 instances of Walla being requested to amend its coverage so it was more favorable to Netanyahu and his family. They said 150 of them involved Netanyahu himself.According to the charges, Shaul Elovitch, CEO of Bezeq, “exerted heavy and continuous pressure” on Ilan Yeshua, the former chief editor of Walla, to change articles on the website to meet the demands of Netanyahu and his family. Yeshua is expected to take the stand on Monday.Israeli law does not require prime ministers to resign while under indictment, and Netanyahu has refused to do so. That has left the country deeply divided. A emergency unity government formed last year to address the coronavirus crisis was mired in political bickering and fell apart in less than a year over its inability to approve a budget.Netanyahu passed Israel’s founding father David Ben Gurion in 2019 as the country’s longest-serving prime minister, having held office continuously since 2009 and for several years in the 1990s.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israel-pm-s-trial-resumes-as-parties-weigh-in-on-his-fate-101617602567723.html

There was no official toll of casualties on Sunday.The Seroja cyclone hit the Savu sea southwest of Timor island in the early hours of Monday, Indonesia's weather agency said, warning that it could bring yet more rain, waves and winds.Extreme weather in the Nusa Tenggara area has obstructed the distribution of oil fuel there, state energy firm Pertamina said, with filling stations, a kerosene shop and four tank cars flooded.Pertamina has alerted fuel terminals in nearby islands to support the supply of fuel to the impacted region, it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indonesia-death-toll-from-floods-landslides-rises-to-55-at-least-40-missing-101617599949468.html

05-04-2021||World||More than 75 dead in Indonesia, East Timor floods, dozens missing||More than 75 people have died and dozens are still missing after flash floods and landslides hit Indonesia and neighbouring East Timor, officials said Monday.Floods sparked by torrential rain have wreaked havoc and destruction on islands stretching from Flores in Indonesia to East Timor, sending thousands fleeing into shelters.The deluge and subsequent landslides caused dams to overflow, submerging thousands of houses and leaving rescue workers struggling to reach trapped survivors."There are 55 dead, but this number is very dynamic and will definitely change, while some 42 people are still missing," Indonesia disaster management agency spokesman Raditya Djati told broadcaster MetroTV.At least 21 people had also died in East Timor, said an official in the tiny half-island nation that lies between Indonesia and Australia.Many of the deaths were in Timor's inundated capital Dili.Mud covered homes, bridges and roads in Indonesia's East Flores municipality, where rescuers struggled to reach a remote and badly-hit area because of rains and strong waves."The mud and the extreme weather have become a serious challenge and the debris piling up has hampered the search and rescue team," Djati said.- 'Medicine, food, blankets' -Scared residents flocked to temporary shelters across the remote region or took refuge in what was left of their homes."The evacuees are spread out. There are hundreds in each sub district but many others are staying at home," said Alfons Hada Bethan, head of the East Flores disaster agency."They need medicine, food, blankets."Pounding rains challenged efforts to find any survivors."We suspect many people are buried but it's not clear how many are missing," Bethan said.In Lembata, an island halfway between Flores and Timor, parts of some villages were swept down a mountainside by torrents of mud, ending up down on the shore of the ocean.Earlier, road access had been cut off and local officials were forced to deploy heavy equipment to reopen the roads.Images from Lembata showed barefoot locals wading through mud and past collapsed houses to evacuate victims on makeshift stretchers and surrounded by collapsed houses.Fatal landslides and flash floods are common across the Southeast Asian archipelago during the rainy season.January saw flash floods hit the Indonesian town of Sumedang in West Java, killing 40 people.And last September, at least 11 people were killed in landslides on Borneo.The country's disaster agency has estimated that 125 million Indonesians -- nearly half of the country's population -- live in areas at risk of landslides.The disasters are often caused by deforestation, according to environmentalists.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/more-than-75-dead-in-indonesia-east-timor-floods-dozens-missing-101617596254692.html
05-04-2021||World||UK to announce new international travel rules||Britain will on Monday set out plans to restart international travel, using a "traffic-light" system as the country cautiously emerges from lockdown.The announcement comes as the UK has set a tentative date of May 17 to relaunch international travel.Travel destinations will be ranked green, amber or red according to virus risk, Downing Street said in a statement late Saturday, with the government to provide more details on Monday.International travel is currently banned except for a handful of permitted reasons. This has created massive pent-up demand for summer holidays abroad."We are doing everything we can to enable the reopening of our country... as safely as possible," Prime Minister Boris Johnson said.The government said the new system "will help ensure the UK's vaccine progress isn't jeopardised and provide clear guidance for travellers".People heading to low-risk "green" countries will simply take a virus test before and after they travel, the government said.But those going to amber or red countries will have to self-isolate or quarantine afterwards.Currently people arriving in the UK from abroad are required to self-isolate for 10 days.British nationals who arrive from a banned "red list" of high-risk countries face costly quarantine in government-approved hotels.The government urged people not to book summer holidays, saying it was "too early to predict" which would be the green-lighted countries.The government has announced it will allow a number of people to attend public events such as football matches from this month in trials of a virus certification system.But it has not made clear whether it will issue "virus passports" for international travel, an idea backed by many tourism-dependent countries and airlines but opposed by more than 70 UK MPs.The UK has already given out more than 31 million first vaccine doses and over 5 million second doses.The rollout has far outstripped popular holiday destinations such as France.This has boosted the public mood after more than 126,000 people died from the virus in the United Kingdom, the highest toll in Europe.From Thursday, those living in England will be able to access two free rapid virus tests per week, a measure aimed at curbing symptom-free virus spread.This will make such tests far more accessible than currently. "More cases will be detected, breaking chains of transmission and saving lives," the government said Monday.Health Secretary Matt Hancock urged people to take up the offer, saying "getting back to normal hinges on us all getting tested regularly".The lateral flow tests will be available at workplaces, community sites, schools and colleges. People will also be able to order delivery of the tests.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-to-announce-new-international-travel-rules-101617596361827.html
05-04-2021||World||Malaysia's ex-PM Najib starts appeal against 1MDB-linked conviction||Malaysia's Court of Appeal on Monday will begin hearing a bid by former prime minister Najib Razak to set aside his conviction on corruption charges in a case linked to a multibillion-dollar scandal at state fund 1MDB.Najib, who was voted out in a historic 2018 election, faces several trials over allegations that $4.5 billion was stolen from 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB), a state fund he co-founded in 2009. He has plead not guilty to all charges.Last year, Najib was sentenced to 12 years in jail and a $50 million fine after being found guilty of criminal breach of trust, abuse of power and money laundering for illegally receiving about $10 million from SRC International, a former 1MDB unit.The sentences were stayed pending an appeal.Defence lawyers are set to argue on Monday that the trial judge had erred in dismissing evidence showing that Najib was misled by Malaysian financier Jho Low and other 1MDB officials into believing that the funds in his account were a donation from the Saudi royal family, according to documents submitted to the court ahead of the hearing. Low, whose whereabouts is unknown, has denied wrongdoing."(Najib) had no knowledge of the 42 million ringgit transactions into his account or knowledge that the same were from the account of SRC," the documents seen by Reuters said.Muhammad Farhan Muhammad Shafee, a lawyer for Najib, confirmed that the documents were filed last month.The court has fixed 12 days between April 5 and 22 to hear the appeal.Prosecutors have said more than $1 billion of 1MDB funds made its way into Najib’s personal accounts, over which he faces a total of 42 criminal charges.At least six countries have opened investigations into 1MDB, in a globe-spanning scandal that has implicated high-level officials and major financial institutions.In recent months, Malaysia has recovered more than $3 billion from U.S. bank Goldman Sachs, audit firm Deloitte, and Malaysian banking group AmBank in separate deals to settle claims linked to 1MDB probes.($1 = 4.1440 ringgit)(Reporting by Rozanna Latiff; Editing by Martin Petty)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/malaysias-ex-pm-najib-starts-appeal-against-1mdb-linked-conviction-101617587006197.html
05-04-2021||World||Minorities in Myanmar borderlands face fresh fear since coup||Before each rainy season Lu Lu Aung and other farmers living in a camp for internally displaced people in Myanmar's far northern Kachin state would return to the village they fled and plant crops that would help keep them fed for the coming year.But this year in the wake of February's military coup, with the rains not far off, the farmers rarely step out of their makeshift homes and don't dare leave their camp. They say it is simply too dangerous to risk running into soldiers from Myanmar's army or their aligned militias.“We can’t go anywhere and can’t do anything since the coup,” Lu Lu Aung said. “Every night, we hear the sounds of jet fighters flying so close above our camp.”The military's lethal crackdown on protesters in large central cities such as Yangon and Mandalay has received much of the attention since the coup that toppled Aung San Suu Kyi's elected government. But far away in Myanmar's borderlands, Lu Lu Aung and millions of others who hail from Myanmar's minority ethnic groups are facing increasing uncertainty and waning security as longstanding conflicts between the military and minority guerrilla armies flare anew.It's a situation that was thrust to the forefront over the past week as the military launched deadly airstrikes against ethnic Karen guerrillas in their homeland on the eastern border, displacing thousands and sending civilians fleeing into neighboring Thailand.Several of the rebel armies have threatened to join forces if the killing of civilians doesn't stop, while a group made up of members of the deposed government has floated the idea of creating a new army that includes rebel groups. The U.N. special envoy for Myanmar, meanwhile, has warned the country faces the possibility of civil war.Ethnic minorities make up about 40% of Myanmar’s 52 million people, but the central government and the military leadership have long been dominated by the country's Burman ethnic majority. Since independence from Britain in 1948, more than a dozen ethnic groups have been seeking greater autonomy, with some maintaining their own independent armies.That has put them at odds with Myanmar's ultranationalist generals, who have long seen any ceding of territory — especially those in border areas that are often rich in natural resources — as tantamount to treason and have ruthlessly fought against the rebel armies with only occasional periods of ceasefire.The violence has led to accusations of abuses against all sides, such as arbitrary taxes on civilians and forced recruitment, and according to the United Nations has displaced some 239,000 people since 2011 alone. That doesn't include the more than 800,000 minority Rohingya who fled to Bangladesh to escape a military campaign the U.N. has called ethnic cleansing.Since February anti-coup protests have taken place in every border state, and security forces have responded much as they have elsewhere with tear gas, rubber bullets and live ammunition. But residents and observers say the post-coup situation in geographically isolated borderlands has been made worse by increased skirmishes between the military and armed ethnic organizations jockeying for power and territory.Lu Lu Aung, who hails from the Kachin ethnic group, said she participated in protests, but stopped as it was now too dangerous. She said Myanmar security forces and aligned militias recently occupied their old village where they planted crops and no one left the camp because they feared they would be forced into work for the army.“Our students can no longer continue the schooling and for the adults it’s so much difficult to find a job and make money,” she said.Humanitarian aid for civilians in the borderlands — already strained by the pandemic as well as the inherent difficulty outside groups face operating in many areas — has been hard it since the coup as well.Communications have been crippled, banks have closed and security has become increasingly uncertain, said the director of a Myanmar-based organization supporting displaced persons who spoke on condition of anonymity for security reasons.“There is no more humanitarian help and support,” she said.In eastern Karen State, where the airstrikes have displaced thousands, there are concerns that the arrival of rainy season could exacerbate a humanitarian situation already made difficult by reports that Thailand has sent back many of the civilians who fled. Thailand has said those who went back to Myanmar did so voluntarily.Yet there are parts of the country’s borderlands that have hardly been impacted by the coup.In Wa State, a region bordering China and Thailand that has its own government, army and ceasefire agreements with the Myanmar military, videos being shared online show life going on as usual, including the rollout of a coronavirus vaccination campaign.Near Bangladesh in coastal Rakhine State, where the Rohingya were driven from and where violent clashes with the Arakan Army group have been ongoing for years, the junta last month removed the group from its list of terrorist groups, raising hopes a lowering of hostilities. The Arakan Army, unlike a number of other armed groups, had not criticized the coup.The group, however, since released a statement that declared its right to defend its territory and civilians against military attacks, leading some to fear a fresh escalation in fighting.Other armed groups have issued similar statements. Some such as the Karen National Union have provided protection for civilians marching in anti-coup protests.Such actions have contributed to the calls for a “federal army” bringing together armed ethnic groups from across the country. But analysts says such a vision would be hard to achieve due to logistical challenges and political disagreements among the groups.“These groups are not in a position where they can provide the support against the Myanmar military needed in urban centers with large populations, or really too far outside their own regions,” said Ronan Lee, a visiting scholar at Queen Mary University of London’s International State Crime Initiative.Despite the uncertainty of what's to come, some minority activists say they have been heartened since the coup by the increased focus on the role ethnic groups can take in Myanmar's future. They also say there appears to be greater understanding — at least among anti-coup protesters — of the struggle minorities have faced for so long.“If there’s any silver lining in all of this, that’s it," said one activist, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of fears for their safety.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/minorities-in-myanmar-borderlands-face-fresh-fear-since-coup-101617589362329.html
05-04-2021||World||Island of Phuket ahead of the rest of Thailand in mass vaccination drive||In Thailand, it's the all-important tourism sector that has jumped to the head of the Covid-19 vaccination line, with the country's most popular resort island embarking on a mass inoculation programme two months ahead of the rest of the country.The island of Phuket aims to deliver shots to at least 460,000 people - most of its population - as it gears up for July 1, when vaccinated overseas visitors will no longer be required to quarantine.Phuket also has its own international airport and tourists would be able to roam the island freely without posing any coronavirus risk to the rest of Thailand's population."If we can build immunity for 70-80% of the population on the island, we can receive foreign tourists who have been vaccinated without the need for quarantine," Phuket's Vice Governor Piyapong Choowong told Reuters.While medical workers, members of the cabinet and the elderly were the first to be vaccinated, Thailand's decision to prioritise Phuket over other parts of the country underscores the central role of tourism to the economy.Spending by foreign tourists accounted for 11-12% of GDP pre-pandemic and the sector has been devastated by the virus with 1.45 million jobs lost since last year.Just 6.7 million foreign tourists visited Thailand in 2020, spending some $11 billion. That compares with nearly 40 million in 2019, when they spent $61 billion.The government wants to see at least 100,000 tourists come to Phuket in the third quarter. It also hopes that as vaccinations worldwide progress it will see a spike in demand in the fourth quarter and that nationwide some 6.5 million visitors will have spent 350 billion baht ($11 billion) by the end of the year."It's a challenge. But that will contribute to GDP to some extent," said Tourism Authority of Thailand Governor Yuthasak Supasorn."We don't expect tourists will come in like a broken dam but we hope to have quality visitors with high spending."Visitors from Europe, the United Arab Emirates and the United States are expected to return first, Yuthasak said.Strict 14-day quarantine requirements for overseas visitors have helped Thailand limit coronavirus infections to around 29,100 cases and 95 deaths but have proven to be too great a hurdle for most tourists.Programmes to attract long-term tourists who test negative for the coronavirus have largely flopped, even with creative measures such as quarantine at golf resorts.Songklod Wongchai, an analyst at Finansia Syrus, believes Thailand could see a quick rebound in tourism, citing the example of the Maldives which has seen hotel occupancy rates bounce back to 70-80% despite cases of the virus."Pent-up demand may come back faster than expected. I think the Land of Smiles will start smiling again," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/island-of-phuket-ahead-of-the-rest-of-thailand-in-mass-vaccination-drive-101617587315141.html

The total number of new Covid-19 infections, including imported infections originating from overseas, stood at 32, marking the highest total since Jan. 31.Genetic analysis of the cases discovered in Ruili suggest the new local infections stem from viruses imported from Myanmar, state media reported. Of the new patients reported in the city, 11 of them were identified as Myanmar citizens.Ruili is a key transit point for Yunnan province, which has struggled to monitor its rugged 4,000 km (2,500-mile) border with Laos, Myanmar and Vietnam for illegal immigration amid a wave of unauthorised crossings last year by people seeking a haven from the pandemic.Local authorities have also begun a vaccination drive in Ruili in a bid to contain Covid-19 and build up herd immunity in the city.The number of new asymptomatic cases, which China does not classify as confirmed cases, stood at 18, matching the total from a day earlier.The total number of confirmed Covid-19 cases in mainland China now stands at 90,305, while the death toll remains unchanged at 4,636.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-china-reports-biggest-jump-in-daily-cases-in-over-2-months-101617587508974.html
05-04-2021||World||Britain's PM Johnson pushes for Covid tests for all to help reopen economy||Everyone in England will be urged to take a coronavirus test twice a week as a new system of Covid passports is assessed for wide-scale use, under Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s plan to reopen the economy after lockdown.Free test kits will be made available through local pharmacies, community centers and home delivery services, when the new regime goes live on April 9.With most of the adult population now having received a vaccine, the government believes rapid testing of the whole population and a system of Covid status certification will help keep control over the pandemic as restrictions are eased.Johnson is due to set out the details later on Monday, ahead of the next step in lifting curbs for businesses and citizens due on April 12.“Massive efforts have been made by the British public to stop the spread of the virus,” Johnson said in a statement released by his office. “As we continue to make good progress on our vaccine program and with our road-map to cautiously easing restrictions underway, regular rapid testing is even more important to make sure those efforts are not wasted.”The U.K. has suffered the highest death toll in Europe from the pandemic and is still reeling from the country’s deepest recession in 300 years.A vaccination program that has rapidly outpaced the rest of Europe has seen 31.5 million people given at least one shot so far, and puts the U.K. in a good position to reopen even as nearby countries such as France are locking down again.Under Johnson’s plans:Many of the measures contained in Johnson’s plan will need to pass votes in Parliament. Johnson is likely to face battling demands from some of his own Conservative Party colleagues to lift the lockdown faster, while more than 70 members of Parliament have launched a campaign to oppose vaccine passports, citing concerns over the erosion of liberties.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2021 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/britains-pm-johnson-pushes-for-covid-tests-for-all-to-help-reopen-economy-101617579531985.html

The Financial Times said Johnson was not expected to set out a specific timeframe.The gradual relaxation of rules will also be aided by an increase in testing availability, with everyone in England entitled to take a rapid COVID-19 test twice a week to prevent outbreaks and find those people not displaying symptoms."As we continue to make good progress on our vaccine programme and with our roadmap to cautiously easing restrictions underway, regular rapid testing is even more important to make sure those efforts are not wasted," Johnson said in a statement.Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are following their own, similar paths out of a strict lockdown that was imposed at the beginning of this year.Britain is able to pursue a recovery after it gave AstraZeneca and Pfizer shots to more than half the adult population. A reopening of schools in March has also not yet led to a spike in cases, despite a ramp-up in more testing.But the United Kingdom has been badly hit by the pandemic. With almost 127,000 deaths, it has the fifth highest toll in the world behind the United States, Brazil, Russia and India.In 2020 its gross domestic product fell by 9.8%, the most in more than three centuries and one of the deepest contractions in the world. Households have saved however, and sterling has gained against the euro ahead of the reopening.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/boris-johnson-to-update-covid-19-roadmap-to-announce-plans-to-reopen-economy-101617582058383.html

The carrier said Wednesday it would resume selling middle seats on May 1, ending the coronavirus-related social-distancing policy after more than a year. With rivals American Airlines Group Inc. and United Airlines Holdings Inc. saying their planes are now flying as much as 80% full, Delta will become the last major U.S. carrier to resume selling all of its seats.As the pandemic stymied U.S. air travel for much of 2020, Delta cut personnel expenses, contributing to flight cancellations. About 17,000 of its workers left voluntarily and another 40,000 took unpaid leave. The Atlanta-based company posted a loss of $12.4 billion last year.The rebound in air travel with the acceleration of coronavirus vaccines has put pressure on airlines that downsized. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said last week that vaccinated individuals don’t need a Covid test and don’t need to quarantine when traveling domestically.More than a million customers have flown Delta over the past few days, reaching levels the company hasn’t seen since before the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/delta-cancels-100-flights-due-to-staff-shortage-to-open-booking-of-middle-seats-101617581582383.html

Most in the queue were young Pakistanis still not eligible for government's free vaccination."I am very happy to get it, since now it is required for travelling," Saad Ahmed, 34, told Reuters on Sunday after he got his shot at an upscale private sector hospital in Karachi.While the private sale of vaccines has begun, the government and importers are still locked in a pricing dispute.Pakistan initially agreed to exempt imported vaccines from price caps, but later rescinded the exemption and said it would set maximum prices.One pharmaceutical company, which had already imported 50,000 doses of Sputnik V, took the government to court, where it won an interim order allowing it to sell it until pricing is decided.As soon as vaccination was opened for walk-in customers, there were long lines of people, Dr Nashwa Ahmed, who runs vaccination at Karachi's South City Hospital, told Reuters.Pictures of queues outside the hospital late into the night were shared on social media.The hospital procured 5,000 doses of Sputnik V and in just over two days all its stock had been administered or pre-booked, said a hospital official who asked not to be identified.Companies, including one of Pakistan's largest banks, have also purchased large quantities to have staff inoculated, the official said.The private sales start as the country deals with a fresh wave of Covid-19 infections and healthcare facilities are fast filling to capacity.The number of patients now in critical care has reached 3,568, the highest since the pandemic started, a cabinet minister, Asad Umar, said on Twitter. Pakistan has thus far reported 687,908 infections and 14,778 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/young-pakistanis-rush-to-purchase-russian-vaccine-as-private-sales-open-101617576639054.html
05-04-2021||World||Capitol attack raises questions of security vs public access||Lawmakers are trying to balance openness with safety after Friday's attack within steps of the Capitol, a challenge for Congress, nearly three months after a mob stormed the seat of American democracy, to “make it as secure as it needs to be but as free as we could possibly make it,” as one senator said Sunday.The sprawling complex has been ringed by security fencing and National Guard troops since the deadly January 6 riot, when supporters of then-President Donald Trump breached the Capitol as members of Congress were certifying Joe Biden's election victory.Friday's attack, now believed to be an isolated incident by a disturbed man, came just weeks after the outermost layer of fencing was removed and the military's footprint was reduced at the Capitol. The man rammed a car into two officers at a barricade outside the Capitol, killing one of them before he was shot to death by police.It quickly underscored the persistence and the range of threats to Congress and the officers charged with protecting the legislative branch.“I think the Capitol has always been a target. ... We need to be aware of that,” said Missouri Sen. Roy Blunt, the top Republican on the Senate Rules and Administration Committee, which oversees that chamber's side of the Capitol.He told ABC's “This Week” that the Capitol is "an important element of who we are. It's an important symbol of who we are. And we need to keep that in mind with every decision we make.”Retired Lt. Gen. Russel Honoré, who was tapped by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., to undertake a security review of the Capitol following the insurrection in January, said it was clear the building had become a greater target.His task force recommended steps to Congress to bolster the complex's physical security, including hiring hundreds more police officers, hardening entrances, enhancing its surveillance system and developing plans for quickly deployable fencing. But he indicated on Sunday that large-scale permanent fencing was unlikely.“From inside the Capitol, talking to many members of Congress on both the Senate and the House side, both parties, they all left us with the impression their number one mission is to secure the Capitol, but make sure it has 100 per cent public access,” Honoré said on ABC.He said that after the September 11, 2001 attacks, 250 National Guard “stayed at the Capitol for two years. And we may look forward to seeing that happen again.”Blunt said the permanent fencing should come down. “I don't think it does the job. In fact, the fencing was right there when the car drove through,” he said. “I think it would be a mistake for fencing to be a permanent part of the Capitol.”Police identified the slain officer as William “Billy” Evans, an 18-year veteran who was a member of the department's first responders unit. That was the same unit to which officer Brian Sicknick, who died from injuries suffered during the January 6 insurrection, belonged. Dozens of officers were injured in the riot, many seriously, and another officer died by suicide later.Federal prosecutors, in court documents, have argued that the riot was planned in advance, with Trump supporters, militia groups and others plotting in advance to disrupt the counting of Electoral College votes. Chatter of a follow-on attack in March kept thousands of guard troops in Washington for months.Friday's attacker, identified by police as 25-year-old Noah Green, rammed a vehicle into Evans and another officer at a barricade just 100 yards from the Capitol building. He exited the car with a knife before he was shot to death by police, officials said. He had been suffering from delusions, paranoia and suicidal thoughts, a U.S. official told The Associated Press.Investigators are increasingly focused on Green's mental health as they work to identify any motive for the attack, said the official, who was not authorized to speak publicly about an ongoing investigation. The official said investigators had talked to Green's family, who spoke of his increasingly delusional thoughts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/capitol-attack-raises-questions-of-security-vs-public-access-101617576030708.html
05-04-2021||World||Florida works to avoid 'catastrophic' pond collapse||Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said Sunday that crews are working to prevent the collapse of a large wastewater pond in the Tampa Bay area while evacuating the area to avoid a “catastrophic flood.”Manatee County officials say the latest models show that a breach at the old phosphate plant reservoir has the potential to gush out 340 million gallons of water in a matter of minutes, risking a 20-foot-high (about 6.1-meter-high) wall of water.“What we are looking at now is trying to prevent and respond to, if need be, a real catastrophic flood situation,” DeSantis said at a press conference after flying over the old Piney Point phosphate mine.Authorities have closed off portions of the U.S. Highway 41 and ordered evacuations of 316 homes. Some families were placed in local hotels.A local jail 1 mile (1.6 kilometers) away from the 77-acre pond is not being evacuated, but officials are moving people and staff to the second story and putting sandbags on the ground floor. Manatee County Administrator Scott Hopes said the models show the area could be covered with between one foot (30 centimeters) to 5 feet (1.5 meters) of water, and the second floor is 10 feet above ground.County officials say well water remains unaffected and there is no threat to Lake Manatee, the area’s primary source of drinking water.The Florida Department of Environmental Protection says the water in the pond is primarily salt water mixed with wastewater and storm water. It has elevated levels of phosphorous and nitrogen and is acidic, but not expected to be toxic, the agency says.Crews have been discharging water since the pond began leaking in March. On Friday, a significant leak that was detected escalated the response and prompted the first evacuations and a declaration of a state of emergency on Saturday. A portion of the containment wall in the reservoir shifted, leading officials to think a collapse could occur at any time.Hopes, the county administrator, said Sunday that with new state resources, crews will be nearly doubling the amount of water being pumped out of the pond and taken to Port Manatee. Currently about 22,000 gallons of water are being discharged per minute, and Hopes said he expects the risk of collapse to decrease by Tuesday.Early Sunday, officials saw an increase of water leaking out, but Hopes says it seems to have plateaued. The water running out on its own is going to Piney Point creek and into Cockroach Bay, an aquatic preserve in the Tampa Bay north of the facility.“Looking at the water that has been removed and the somewhat stability of the current breach, I think the team is much more comfortable today than we were yesterday," he said. “We are not out of the critical area yet.”Hopes said he could not rule out that a full breach could destabilize the walls of the other ponds at the Piney Point site.The Florida DEP Secretary Noah Valenstein said another pond has higher levels of metals.“The radiologicals are still below surface water discharge standards. So, again this is not water we want to see leaving the site,” he said.Officials said the federal Environmental Protection Agency is sending a representative to be at the command center in Manatee County. The agency did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Calls to the owner of the site, HRK Holdings, for comments went unanswered Saturday and Sunday.The ponds sit in stacks of phosphogypsum, a solid radioactive byproduct from manufacturing fertilizer. State authorities say the water in the breached pond is not radioactive.But the EPA says too much nitrogen in the wastewater causes algae to grow faster, leading to fish kills. Some algal blooms can also harm humans who come into contact with polluted waters, or eat tainted fish.Environmental groups urged the federal government this weekend to step in to halt sending more wastewater to the existing so-called gypsum stacks and halting the creation of more phosphogypsum, which is left behind when phosphate rock is mined to produce fertilizer.“We hope the contamination is not as bad as we fear, but are preparing for significant damage to Tampa Bay and the communities that rely on this precious resource,” Justin Bloom, founder of the Sarasota-based nonprofit organization Suncoast Waterkeeper, said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/florida-works-to-avoid-catastrophic-pond-collapse-101617575828790.html
05-04-2021||World||China pushes vaccine on bankers, colleges to catch up with US||China is ramping up its Covid-19 vaccination push, aiming to be twice as fast as the US by pressuring Communist Party members, bank workers and college staff to get shots, as the lagging rollout threatens to undermine the advantage it secured by effectively wiping out the virus.The inoculation effort has been stepped up markedly in recent weeks, with China now administering an average of 5 million doses a day from less than a million at the start of the year. While a significant increase, that translates to 5 doses for every 100 people, compared to 25 in the US and 56 in Israel, according to Bloomberg’s vaccine tracker.Like other countries in the Asia Pacific region that have quashed the coronavirus, China is facing significant hurdles in its vaccination drive, as people don’t see the same urgent need to get inoculated as those in places still battling Covid-19. However, the prospect of other countries -- particularly geopolitical rivals like the US-- achieving herd immunity and re-opening their economies and borders sooner is hardening the resolve to speed up vaccinations in China.“It will challenge the success of China’s Covid response if developed countries are reopening to each other and China still tries to contain the virus from coming in,” said Yanzhong Huang, director of the Center for Global Health Studies at New Jersey’s Seton Hall University.The Chinese Center for Disease Prevention and Control upped its vaccination target earlier this month, and now aims to get as many as 560 million people, or 40% of its vast population, injected by the end of June. That means China will need to give out some 460 million doses in the next three months -- more than two times as much as the goal stated by US President Joe Biden for roughly the same timespan.‘From Commanding Heights to Troughs’Just as some in the US are eligible for donuts after vaccination, part of China’s approach to get people to vaccinate involves dishing out freebies.One poster in downtown Beijing, for example, says that residents over 60 are eligible for a basket of eggs after getting vaccinated. The city’s Daxing district, home to major technology companies, is luring residents by offering shopping coupons. On one such voucher, slogans encourage people to heed the call to get vaccinated in order to secure the ultimate Covid victory.Accompanying the accelerated rollout is also a hardening propaganda campaign that increasingly links vaccination to maintaining national pride and China’s place on the world stage.“Injecting the Covid vaccine is not simply an option, it is the responsibility and duty of every Chinese citizen,” according to a news anchor on a program broadcast on state broadcaster CCTV last week. “If we do not rely on vaccinations to consolidate our hard-earned strengths in fighting the virus, we could suddenly slide from commanding heights to troughs.” The news clip has been distributed widely by community workers on chat groups to convince people to get vaccinated.To achieve its goals, China is calling on its 92 million Communist Party members, plus tens of millions of people employed at state-owned companies.Some party members have been summoned to meetings where they’ve been told to get shots as soon as possible in order to set an example, according to people familiar with the matter. At one such meeting in Beijing, cadres were told they had to get vaccinated, unless they got a medical exemption.Employees of at least three state-owned banks and at least one major university who would not speak on the record said that staff have been repeatedly urged to get vaccinated, and had to provide an official reason if they declined.The information office of China’s State Council didn’t respond to requests for comment. The State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission, or SASAC, which oversees China’s government-run companies, didn’t immediately respond to a fax seeking comment.“We’ve seen populations of entire cities queue up and be tested within a few days, and the same kind of infrastructure could be used for mass vaccination,” said Benjamin Cowling, head of epidemiology and biostatistics at the University of Hong Kong.Indeed, China has experience in getting vaccination on such a large scale accomplished in the past. In 2010, the government launched a measles inoculation blitz, giving out 100 million doses to children around the country in 10 days to quell a resurgence in the disease.Punitive MeasuresThe question is whether the current approach, comprising of small incentives and societal and peer pressure, can get China’s vaccination numbers sufficiently high enough in the face of widespread vaccine hesitancy.Observers expect officials may need to escalate incentives, for example using punitive measure like restricting the movement of people who haven’t been inoculated.Cowling said that the government could further link vaccination status with the existing health code system, which allows vaccinated people to travel more easily and perhaps be exempt from some quarantine policies.Some local officials are already escalating measures: a city in Hainan province put out posters warning that if people didn’t get vaccinated they would be blacklisted, and barred from public transport, receiving government subsidies and other benefits. The city government later apologized for the harshness of the notice and rescinded the rules.Lin Liwei, a 35-year-old migrant worker in Beijing, is waiting to receive her second dose of the vaccine. Lin fears that she wouldn’t be allowed to board a train to return home to Inner Mongolia if she isn’t inoculated.“If you’re not vaccinated, you’re out,” said Lin.For the time being, the government is still waiting to see how far the existing approach can get them in the vaccination drive, said Seton Hall’s Huang. It could ultimately move to make vaccines compulsory, as some other countries like Indonesia have done.“I don’t think China would mind eventually making vaccination mandatory considering they have implemented far more draconian measures,” said Huang. “As long as you have the vaccine supply and the ability to widely administer shots, it won’t be a problem to make vaccination an obligation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-pushes-vaccine-on-bankers-colleges-to-catch-up-with-us-101617573890654.html

Tokyo considers its US alliance to be the cornerstone of its diplomatic and security policies.Taiwan is expected to be on the agenda as the leaders seek ways to deal with China’s growing security threat in the region.Chinese warplanes are increasingly entering Taiwanese airspace, and China has protested an agreement to bolster cooperation between the US and Taiwanese coast guards that followed Washington’s new sales of arms equipment to Taipei.“It is important for Japan and the United States to cooperate and use deterrence to create an environment where Taiwan and China can find a peaceful solution,” Suga said on a television talk show on Sunday.Philippines, China war of words escalate over SCSManilaThe Philippines defence minister has accused Beijing of planning to occupy more “features” in the South China Sea (SCS), in an escalating war of words over Chinese vessels in the waters.A fleet of more than 200 Chinese ships that sparked a diplomatic row last month after parking at Whitsun Reef off the Philippines is now scattered across the contested Spratly Islands.Manila has called on Beijing to withdraw the “maritime militia” vessels from the area.China has refused, insisting they are fishing boats and are allowed to operate there. But defence secretary Delfin Lorenzana said the vessels were there for other reasons. “The continued presence of Chinese maritime militias in the area reveals their intent to further occupy features in the West Philippine Sea,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taiwans-peace-stability-key-to-region-says-japan-s-yoshihide-suga-101617569886377.html
05-04-2021||World||UK vaccine passport trials to begin in coming months||Britain’s government is planning to trial a coronavirus status certification plan over the coming months to allow the safe return of mass gatherings at places like sports grounds and nightclubs.Officials are expected to consider passports that show whether a person has received a vaccine, has recently tested negative for the virus, or has immunity due to having tested positive in the previous six months.The trial events will include soccer’s FA Cup semi-final and final, the World Snooker Championships, and a comedy club show. Prime Minister Boris Johnson is expected to set out more details on Monday.Pope urges jabs for poorRome: Millions of Christians around the world celebrated a second Easter under coronavirus restrictions on Sunday with Pope Francis calling for vaccines to be shared among the poorest nations as Covid-19 surges.Despite vaccine rollouts gathering pace in many richer countries, dramatic spikes in cases have seen deeply unpopular restrictions enforced from Canada to Europe and South America. Vaccination was “an essential tool” in the fight against the virus, the pope said in his Easter Sunday address, with Italy under a strict lockdown over the weekend.“I urge the entire international community... to commit to overcoming delays in the distribution of vaccines and to facilitate their distribution, especially in the poorest countries,” he said to a congregation of only around 100 people inside the vast St Peter’s Basilica.Stricter curbs have come into effect in Belgium as well as in France, where authorities are scrambling to deal with a serious spike in cases.Across the Atlantic, Canada marked a grim milestone of one million Covid-19 cases. According to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, the number of cases was at 1,001,651 on Saturday, becoming the 23rd nation to cross the million mark. The increase in caseload has resulted in several provinces enforcing restrictive measures again.And celebrations have been dampened in South America too, where Brazil is in the grip of a devastating outbreak. The worrying situation led Peru to go into an Easter lockdown, Bolivia to seal the frontier with Brazil, and Chile to close all borders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-vaccine-passport-trials-to-begin-in-coming-months-101617569636996.html
05-04-2021||World||107 arrested in London as protesters clash with police||A total 107 people have been arrested after clashes between officers and demonstrators at a "Kill the Bill" protest in central London on Saturday, the Metropolitan Police has said.Projectiles were thrown around as Met Police officers pushed protesters away in an effort to disperse crowds. Earlier, the police said that around 10 of its officers had received injuries during the operation.In an update on Sunday, the Met Police said the arrests were made for a variety of offences including breach of the peace; violent disorder; assault on police and breaches of Covid legislation.In one instance, a woman was arrested on suspicion of possession of an offensive weapon after a knife was recovered.“While our advice to people remains not to attend large gatherings, the vast majority of people who attended central London yesterday [Saturday], adhered to social distancing, and engaged and listened to my officers. However, as the afternoon wore on it became clear that a small number of people were intent on remaining to cause disruption to law-abiding Londoners,” Commander Ade Adelekan, who led the policing operation in Parliament Square in London, said on Sunday.“Despite repeated instructions from officers to leave, they did not and, amid increasing levels of disorder, arrests were made. We should not allow the behaviour of a few individuals who attend these events with the purpose of committing criminal acts to taint the good behaviour of the majority who attended yesterday,” he said.“We remain in the middle of a global pandemic and we have made great progress in controlling the spread of the virus; we will not allow the selfish actions of a small number of people to put Londoners progress in jeopardy,” he added.The so-called “Kill the Bill” demonstrations also took place in Birmingham, Liverpool, Manchester, Bristol, Newcastle, Brighton, Bournemouth, Weymouth and Luton to protest against the Police and Crime Bill – which propose to give police in England and Wales more power to impose conditions on non-violent protests, including those which are deemed too noisy or a nuisance.Anyone refusing to follow police directions about a protest could be fined up to 2,500 pounds under the law.Former Labour Party Leader Jeremy Corbyn was among those who addressed the protest in London and said the bill would prevent protest without police approval."Stand up for the right to protest, stand up for the right to have your voice heard," he told the crowds.Protesters also carried anti-sexism placards and chanted "women scared everywhere, police and government do not care" as they marched past Downing Street.In Bristol, more than 1,000 people gathered for a peaceful protest, after demonstrations on 23 March and 26 March ended in clashes with police, and in Manchester, people were seen sitting on tram tracks before police moved in.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/107-arrested-in-london-as-protesters-clash-with-police-101617561713634.html
05-04-2021||World||Europe ramps up vaccinations as coronavirus haunts Easter holidays||The French city of Lyon's main stadium opened as a mass vaccination centre during Easter weekend, and thousands spent the holiday lining up for injections at hippodromes, velodromes or other sites as France tried to speed up shots amid a new rush of coronavirus cases.But as Europe celebrated its second Easter in a row under the cloud of the pandemic, some cities put vaccinations on hold over during the long holiday weekend - defying French President Emmanuel Macron's insistence that “there are no weekends or days off during vaccination.”Medical workers need “a little rest at last,” said an official with the French city of Strasbourg, which shut down vaccination facilities from Good Friday through Easter Monday, a public holiday. To ensure that residents still had access to potentially life-saving vaccines, Strasbourg expanded vaccination hours and administered all of its weekly supply of doses between last Monday and Thursday, the official said.Spain, Italy and Germany faced a similar holiday vaccination challenge.Spaniards lined up for shots on Easter Sunday in Barcelona and other points around the country, but Madrid halted vaccinations at local health centers to give staff a break. The Spanish capital continued to give shots at a soccer stadium and a new hospital built to help handle pandemic cases.With Spain fearing yet another surge of infections like the one now overwhelming French intensive care wards, Spanish Health Minister Carolina Darias had urged regional authorities to keep up vaccinations throughout Easter Week.The French city of Sarcelles, north of Paris, was among those whose vaccination center stayed open Easter Sunday, amid mushrooming infections and demand. The center's organizers planned to inject 2,000 doses Sunday - twice their daily average.Those waiting to get inside felt lucky and relieved. The surrounding Val d'Oise region now has the highest coronavirus infection rate in France, and the situation in Sarcelles symbolizes how the pandemic has worsened existing inequalities.“The problem is with people who do not qualify yet and are in a hurry, which I understand as they want to get back to a normal life," said Dr. Majida El Mokhtari. "Unfortunately we are not able to vaccinate everybody with the doses that are distributed to us.”The city's working class residents have higher exposure to the virus because many can't work remotely. In the area's housing projects, many families have multiple generations living in close quarters. Language barriers make sorting out vaccination arrangements a challenge for many immigrants.In Lyon, French first division soccer club Olympique Lyon opened its stadium and provided volunteer employees to help medical workers and firefighters with a mass vaccination drive that started Saturday. Authorities plan to administer 3,000 doses per day during the first three days.Club President Jean Michel Aulas expressed hope that the effort would help create “social cohesion” at a time of strain and uncertainty, as France entered a third partial lockdown starting Sunday.Meanwhile, the French military announced that it would open seven vaccination centers starting Tuesday to help inject civilians.In Italy, those fortunate to get a vaccine in Milan on Sunday received an extra reward: an Easter cake in the shape of a dove and packages of pasta. Only one hospital in the city administered vaccines on Easter, according to Italian media. Among those administering the injections at Milan's Niguarda Hospital were retired hospital doctors volunteering their time.“We're just making our contribution to this important battle” against COVID-19, Dr. Vincenzo Rapisarda told SkyTG24 TV.German vaccination centers appeared to mostly stay open over the holiday, but numbers of injections are typically slower on weekends.The accelerated Easter actions in some European Union countries stood in contrast to the slow beginning of Europe's vaccine rollout over Christmas and New Year's.While France remains far behind Britain and the United States in terms of vaccinating its population, the pace is starting to pick up. France has administered 12 million vaccine doses overall, including nearly 1 million in the last three days.Spanish authorities are speeding up vaccination efforts with the arrival of 2 million doses over the past week, its biggest lot yet. Spain had administered 8.5 million doses as of Friday.Across the Channel, authorities in Britain were planning to test a series of measures including “coronavirus status certifications” over the coming weeks to see if they can allow people to safely return to mass gatherings at sports arenas, nightclubs and concerts.People attending a range of events, including conferences and soccer's FA Cup, will need to be tested both before and after. The trials will also gather evidence on how ventilation and different approaches to social distancing could enable large events to go ahead.British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is expected to set out more details about the coronavirus passports on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/europe-ramps-up-vaccinations-as-coronavirus-haunts-easter-holidays-101617561271164.html

At 9,879 new cases, its capital Mumbai too reported a dip in the number of cases in the 24-hour span. Dharavi, one of the worst-affected areas in Mumbai during last year's peak, reported 47 new cases on Monday. The state-wide total now stands at 30,57,885.This decrease in daily caseload is due to a dip in the number of samples. On Sunday, 1,96,988 tests were carried out, whereas today, this number dipped to 1,75,682, the health bulletin showed. So far, 2,07,15,793 samples have been tested in Maharashtra.The state reported 155 deaths on Monday, taking the death toll to 56,044. Mumbai reported 21 deaths in the last 24 hours, and the city's death toll now stands at 11,800. The state currently has 4,51,375 active Covid-19 cases.26,252 patients were discharged today, bringing the recovery rate in the state to 83.36%, the health bulletin showed. Till date, a total of 25,49,075 people have been discharged, said the bulletin.Dr Shekhar Mande, director-general of the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), told reporters via a video conference on Sunday that a mutant variant of Covid-19 has been a cause of concern in Maharashtra. Mande said the mutant was first observed in the United States and probably reached the state through people who travelled to India from the US. He also urged people to follow Covid-19 preventative behaviour.“We have asked the state government to monitor L452R mutant, which is causing concern. On this, I am in constant touch with the state government,” Mande told reporters.Maharashtra continues to be the worst affected state in the country followed by Punjab. The state has added 426,108 Covid-19 cases to the country's coronavirus tally in the last two weeks as of March 31. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray wrote to the Prime Minister on Monday, urging him to reduce the age limit of vaccine eligibility to 25 years, owing to the rise in the number of daily cases. So far, the Centre has only allowed states to vaccinate those above 45 years of age.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtras-daily-covid-19-caseload-dips-by-10-000-mumbai-s-tally-down-too-101617637218043.html
05-04-2021||India||Unparalleled feat: Indian Railways completes arch of world’s highest rail bridge||Indian Railways on Monday achieved an unparalleled feat when the 5.6-metre-long last piece of metal (a closure segment) was fitted at the highest point of the arch of the world’s highest railway bridge. The bridge runs over Chenab river in Jammu and Kashmir’s Reasi district. The bridge, which is 35-metre higher than the Eiffel Tower in Paris, is expected to be completed within a year, said Northern Railway General Manager Ashutosh Gangal at the work site in Reasi.“It is a historic day for the Northern Railways and a milestone in the completion of the USBRL project, connecting Kashmir with the rest of the country. The project will be completed within two and a half years,” Gangal added.The final metal closure joined the two arms of the arch that currently stretch towards each other from both banks of the Chenab.The construction of the arch of the world’s highest railway bridge, which soars 359 metres above the bed of the Chenab river in Jammu and Kashmir, was completed on Monday.The 1.3 kilometre-long bridge aims to boost connectivity to the Kashmir Valley and is being constructed at a cost of ₹1,486 crore as part of the Udhampur-Srinagar-Baramulla Railway Link (USBRL) project.Railway minister Piyush Goyal watched the lowering of the closure segment of the arch by cable crane through a video link from Delhi. The Arch looms over Chenab, flowing 359 metres below.“This was one of the most difficult parts of the bridge over Chenab. This achievement is a major leap towards the completion of the 111 km-long winding stretch from Katra to Banihal. It is arguably the biggest civil-engineering challenge faced by any railway project in India in recent history,” Gangal said. The 5.6-metre last piece of metal was fitted at the highest point Monday and joined the two arms of the arch that currently stretch towards each other from both the banks of the river. With this, the shape of the arch got completed which will loom over the treacherous Chenab.After the completion of the arch work, removal of the stay cables, filling of the concrete in the arch rib, erection of the steel trestle, launching of the viaduct and track laying work will be taken up.Indian Railways is constructing the iconic Arch Bridge on river Chenab as a part of the USBRL project to connect the Kashmir valley to the rest of the nation. This bridge is about 1,315 meters long. The construction of the bridge involved the fabrication of 28,660 MT steel, 10 lakh cum earthwork, 66,000 cum concrete and 26 km motorable roads.The sophisticated ‘Tekla’ software was used for its structural detailing and the structural steel is suitable for -10 degrees Celsius to 40 degrees Celsius temperature, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/unparalleled-feat-indian-railways-completes-arch-of-world-s-highest-rail-bridge-101617640217489.html
05-04-2021||India||Uddhav Thackeray writes to PM Modi, asks for lowering the age bar for Covid-19 vaccine to 25||Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Monday urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to widen the ambit of vaccinating people against the Covid-19 disease outbreak and permit the inoculation of people aged 25.In a letter to the Prime Minister, Thackeray reasoned that the move will benefit Maharashtra - the worst-affected state - and those vaccinated by reducing the severity among the young and working population falling in that age bracket."I request you to lower it to 25, as the states facing the surge are having to place curbs to safeguard lives of the population. However, if a larger number of our young and working population is vaccinated, the intensity of the cases would be much lower than the treatment that they need today," Thackeray said in his letter. A copy of the letter was shared by the chief minister's official Twitter account.Underlining that the state has remained at the forefront of vaccination drive by administering the most doses, Thackeray said, "Maharashtra has taken Covid-19 vaccination very seriously and we are the number one state in the country in terms of total number of Covid vaccine doses administered."CM Uddhav Balasaheb Thackeray has written to the Hon’ble Prime Minister Shri @narendramodi to further lower the age group eligible for vaccination to 25years old to curb the intensity of the rising cases in the state. pic.twitter.com/YWwebaYW9X"As of Sunday, we have administered 76.86 lakh doses of Covid vaccine, which is highest in the country. We have recently ramped up our vaccination drive and on April 3, we administered more than 4.62 lakh covid vaccine doses in a single day," the CM said in his letter.Amid the second wave, Thackeray said that the state, with its increased testing and absolute transparent methods of reporting, is reaching out to each and every possible Covid-19 positive person to assist her/ him on the way to recovery.India, currently in its third phase of Covid-19 vaccination, has started vaccinating people above the age of 45. In the first phase, which started on January 16, India vaccinated healthcare workers with two vaccines - Covishield (Oxford-AstraZeneca's vaccine manufactured by Serum Institute of India) and Covaxin (manufactured by Bharat Biotech Limited). The drive was further opened up to 20 million frontline workers February 1 onwards.In the next phase of the Covid-19 vaccination drive, authorities aimed to inoculate people above 60 years and those over 45 with comorbidities against the coronavirus from March 1.The vaccine drive was meant to first immunise 300 million people who belong to three categories: healthcare workers, frontline workers, and those at greater risk from Covid-19 due to their age or existing medical conditions.Thackeray also reminded the PM that the state has also requested for additional vaccine doses so that the six districts "facing the surge of Covid-19 can be covered on priority and in greater speed"."Mumbai, Pune, Thane, Nashik, Nagpur and Aurangabad can be covered in a matter of 3 weeks, for the population above 45, if 1.5 crore doses are made available to the state by the government of India," he said.India recorded the highest single-day rise of 1.03 lakh new Covid-19 cases, prompting PM Modi to convene another round of meetings with chief ministers and state health ministers on Thursday amid growing calls to open up the vaccination drive against the disease to all age groups.Additionally, Union health minister Harsh Vardhan will hold a meeting on Tuesday with health ministers of 11 states that have been witnessing a surge in cases to review the situation there.The 11 states are Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Delhi, Gujarat, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab and Rajasthan.While a few states like Delhi, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu have announced closure of schools for an indefinite period, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Bihar and Punjab among others have suspended classes for a brief period. Schools have been directed to impart education through online mode.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uddhav-thackeray-writes-to-pm-modi-asks-for-lowering-the-age-bar-for-covid-19-vaccine-to-25-101617636637958.html

05-04-2021||India||Elections promise no relief for Tiruppur’s stressed textile industry||It’s about 6pm and the workers at SJ International, a textile firm that specialises in embroidery, have just completed their ‘April 1’ prayers to herald in the new financial year. There is an eerie silence in the small factory as the swanky looking machines from Japan, extending from one end of the room to the other, have been switched off since the company has just one order and the machines can only be used when embroidering over 10 pieces of clothing at one go.“There is nothing we can say. Just take a look at the switched off machines and you will understand our position,” said Kumar, the manager of this establishment. Orders have been hard to come by. The company only provides value added services to the larger exports business, but poor order books have cast a shadow of uncertainty in Tiruppur’s once thriving textile business.Five years ago, the cost of embroidery on one piece was ₹40 and the salary of an operator was ₹7000. Now the cost of embroidery is ₹20, but the salary of the operator has more than doubled to ₹15000, Kumar said, listing out one of the many challenges of this textile town.As we walk out, we stumble upon a poll-pamphlet promising ₹1500 per family per month, a washing machine, one government job, a solar stove and other attractive offers if All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) comes to power. Similarly, the loudspeakers used for campaigning by the Communist Party of India candidate, who is in alliance with the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), can be heard for several hundred meters in the bylanes of the Appaji Nagar, where several small and medium size units operate.Elections in the state have brought with it no hope for an industry that has taken one blow after another since demonetisation in 2016, introduction of goods and services tax (GST) and then the Covid-19 outbreak last year. The latest of the challenges for the industry are the surge in Yarn prices that have gone up by as much as ₹60-70 per kg, hurting orders and margins.“We are just not getting Yarn as suppliers say they do not have any even if we are willing to pay a higher price. The delays add to pressure on delivery targets, and we are forced to shell out more for freight cost,” Ravi Kumar, an entrepreneur who runs a medium size textile unit said.The city of Tiruppur has thousands of small and big textile companies who specialise in knitwear and readymade garments. The first knitwear unit in this parched district was set up in 1925 and by the 1940’s it started to turn into a large hub for textiles. Coimbatore, one of the three centres (including Bombay and Ahmedabad) in India that was referred to as ‘Manchesters’ is just 40 kms away.Though Tiruppur focused on the domestic industry till about the 1980’s, the fortunes of this small town took a turn for the better since then as it began exports, first to Italy.Legend has it that popular Italian brand Verona first came to this town in 1978 through Mumbai (then Bombay) to buy white T-shirts.Today there are hundreds of internationally reputed brands whose base for production is Tirupur like Nike, Tommy Hilfiger, Adidas, Ralph Lauren, Polo, GAP and Primark among scores of others.In 1984, Tirupur exported 104 lakh pieces of clothing, valued at ₹9.69 crore which has reached ₹22,715 crore till February 2021, data shows. Tiruppur accounts for 52% of India’s knitwear production and earns revenues of around ₹50,000 crore per annum just from textiles (both exports and domestic market).The lockdowns in European countries have also impacted demand as they account for the majority of Tirupur’s exports.The first lockdown in India also saw the departure of around 30% of the nearly 800,000 labourers to their hometowns and majority of whom are yet to return.“We have asked the government to construct permanent housing for migrant workers so that they also have a sense of belonging here. That could help us mitigate our labour crisis,” S Sakthivel of the Tiruppur Exporters Association (TEA) said.Compounding the crisis for the industry, there is uncertainty on the Remission of Duties and Taxes on Exported Products (RoDTEP) scheme since it is a new Financial Year. Under this scheme, duties on taxes levied at the central, state and local levels such as electricity and VAT on fuel will be refunded to exporters.Both the AIADMK and DMK have promised everything from monthly salaries to government jobs and all kinds of freebies but nothing for this industry, which is clearly struggling currently.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/elections-promise-no-relief-for-tiruppur-s-stressed-textile-industry-101617634575006.html

The new cases pushed the total cases to 679,962. The fatality count also rose to 11,096 after 15 new deaths were recorded in the last 24 hours, the bulletin showed.The slight dip in the daily cases, down from 4,033 seen on Sunday, was seen amid reduced testing on Monday as only 64,003 tests were conducted in the last 24 hours, as opposed to 86,899 conducted a day earlier.Out of the 64,003 tests conducted, 43,960 people were tested through RT-PCR tests and 20,043 were tested via rapid antigen testing method.The virality of infection and its spread has also surged in the last 24 hours, as indicated by the positivity rate which has crossed the 5% mark. On Sunday, the positivity rate in Delhi rose to 4.64% from 4.48% a day earlier but on Monday, it reached 5.54% - suggesting that more people are testing positive in the bracket of those being tested.After witnessing a constant surge in cases since March, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal confirmed that the city-state is witnessing the fourth wave of infections, even as the rest of the country is reeling from the second wave.“For the rest of the country, one may call it the second wave. But for Delhi, this is the fourth wave. We are heading towards the fourth peak. This wave is witnessing exponential increase in cases and spreading very fast. It is concerning but there is nothing to panic because this wave is also less severe in terms of number of deaths and cases that require hospitalisation, admission to ICU, etc,” Kejriwal said at a digital news briefing.Delhi reported its first wave in June, the second in September and the third in November, which has been the worst so far, with the highest case tally of 8,593.The rise in cases and deaths comes even as the authorities have ramped up testing and tracing the cases as a strategy to tackle the viral contagion.Recording a further increase, active cases in Delhi were logged at 14,589 on Monday, as opposed to 13,982 from Sunday.As the country finds itself in the grip of second wave, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is set to interact with chief ministers on Thursday to discuss the Covid-19 situation and the ongoing vaccination drive.Modi's last interaction with chief ministers was on March 17 during which he had expressed concern over the rise in cases in parts of the country and called for "quick and decisive" steps to check the "emerging second peak".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-records-3-548-new-covid-19-cases-over-3-000-containment-zones-created-101617632461346.html

We are living through some interesting times," he said."It is the right time for all of us, the military operators, the industry, the think-tanks and all the AI specialists for creating next-generation AI enablers for air war," the IAF chief said.He said it was time to plant a "robust tree" for development of AI in the country.At the same time, he mentioned that different nations with different threat perceptions would have different requirements and this would have evolved over a period of time and experience."We have already embarked on an AI journey and having gone through some of the important automation projects in the recent past, we have started testing AI and AI- based applications on some projects which are in different stages," he added.The air chief marshal elaborated that AI is being developed in multiple areas in the air domain to accrue diverse and asymmetrical operations benefits.Air Chief Marshal Bhadauria added that currently AI has not matured to an extent where completely autonomous missions can be executed."However, there is a need to address some questions to this effect- whether algorithms can be trained to effectively execute mission planning behaviours in unpredictable scenarios; can machines be taught combat strategies; can sufficiently generalised representations be built to capture the richness of the planning problem itself across the threat matrix," he said."The answer to these questions will help us firm up our requirement specifications that will essentially be a starting document vis-a-vis the expected outcomes. If we tend to utilise AI heavily in combat aviation, we may need to redefine or even abandon certain traditional principles," he added.The defence ministry has been focusing on application of AI in the three services.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ai-can-bring-enormous-changes-in-way-we-train-and-fight-wars-iaf-chief-101617632946203.html

But it is the misfortune of the country that the prime minister goes to Bangladesh and does not mention how Indira Gandhi contributed and 90,000 soldiers surrendered,” Gehlot said.The Congress leader said the respect Modi has got from foreign governments and Non Resident Indians during his visits abroad is not just for him.It is respect for the journey of 70 years of independent India, the CM added in his video conference address to North Western Railway employees.Now a US paper has written that democracy in India is shrinking, and the country’s system are being criticised, the CM said. He claimed that the nation is heading towards a “dangerous turn”.The BJP is committed to carrying out the agenda of the RSS, Gehlot said, referring also to “love jihad” – the right-wing allegation that Muslim youth are marrying Hindu women to convert them.Gehlot alleged that the judiciary, Election Commission of India, Income Tax Department and other agencies are working under pressure.On Railways, he said it was a priority sector for former prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru.He said the rail network has played an important role in keeping a country of different languages and religions united.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-mum-on-indira-gandhi-s-role-in-creation-of-bangladesh-ashok-gehlot-101617628241991.html

So tum bhi lagwaao so ache ho ja ho. Kuchhu dikkat nainuaan...(I took the vaccine so that I feel better. You also take it so that you feel better. No troubles at all)."According to her Aadhaar card 790309436468, Tulsabai was born on January 1, 1903 and is a resident of Sadarpur area of Sagar, which is part of the Bundelkhand region, news agency PTI reported.Frm April 1, the Centre expanded the nationwide vaccinatin drive to include everyone above thr age of 45. The Centre has warned that the situation is going from "bad to worse" and urged states to achieve 100 per cent vaccination coverage of those above the age of 45 years in surge districts within the next two weeks.India started its second phase of the Covid-19 vaccination drive to inoculate people above 60 years and those over 45 with comorbidities against the coronavirus from March 1.The first phase of the world's largest inoculation drive was kicked off on January 16 with two vaccines - Covishield (Oxford-AstraZeneca's vaccine manufactured by Serum Institute of India) and Covaxin (manufactured by Bharat Biotech Limited).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/118yearold-madhya-pradesh-woman-vaccinated-against-covid-19-shows-no-side-effects-officials-101617626437851.html
05-04-2021||India||UK, California, Manaus: What they suggest about the Covid crisis in Maharashtra||In the middle of February, when India recorded its lowest Covid-19 numbers in a year, the state of Maharashtra began bucking the trend. The inflection point appears to be right in the middle of the month – on February 14. In the first 14 days, the state logged an average of roughly 2,500 cases a day. In the latter half, this number swelled more than twice to 5,300.And the rate doubled again over the next fortnight – the first two weeks in March.For the rest of India, the inflection point would not arrive till March 3. By this time, Maharashtra’s trajectory had begun ringing alarm bells.Also Read | Covid-19: India second country after US to record over 1 lakh daily casesImperfect sampling for serological surveys and whole-genome testing has meant that the government has not been able to determine whether this trend is due to a factor beyond simply people being careless, although it has found an increasing number of samples showing two particular mutations: E484Q and L452R.The deviation in Maharashtra’s trajectory (and to some extend Punjab’s) resembles examples from three other regions where mutations have in fact been implicated: United Kingdom (UK)’s London and south-east, Brazil’s Manaus and California in the United States (US). All three are believed to be the ground zero for variants that make the coronavirus spread more readily or cheat immunity from a previous infection (or both).Parallel 1: London and SE England, the UKAll things being equal (in terms of restrictions), Maharashtra’s case trajectory against the backdrop of the rest of the country has a particularly similarity with what happened in the UK at the outset of last winter.Within a fortnight, beginning November 29, London and parts of UK’s south-east turned into new hotbeds of coronavirus infections. This was particularly stark since the country was in the middle of a lockdown (UK’s lockdowns have typically been less stringent than what Indians are used to) to avoid an expected surge during the Christmas holiday season.This surge would eventually be attributed to the variant known as B.1.1.7, or VOC 202012/01 – the first coronavirus variant under investigation. The variant has since been correlated with the virus becoming more infective and slightly more lethal.Parallel 2: California, USA little over halfway into January, the state of California overtook the New York state to become the hardest hit region in terms of fatalities in the US. What would be its fourth wave, infections in California began surging in the run-up to Christmas for a peak that would last roughly three weeks beginning late December.To be sure, California is US’s most populous state, but the December-January wave is unique for its magnitude — at one point it was detecting over four times as many cases in a day in December as its second wave in July.The holiday season has been seen as a clear link. But increasingly, scientists are also suspected a new variant to be causing it. Over five months beginning September, this variant rose to account for more than 50% of all samples subjected to genetic analysis, the LA Times reported.This variant is known as B.1.427 and B.1.429 and scientists believe that it may be drawing its more worrying nature from the particular mutation that has also been detected in Maharashtra: L452R.At least two studies, here and here, find that the L452R mutation in particular was more resistant to antibodies drawn from people who had a previous infection with the globally predominant variant or from those that had taken vaccine doses. Both the studies were lab tests, and how this increased resistance translates needs to be verified.Parallel 3: Manaus, BrazilThe region of Manaus in Brazil has been mysterious for scientists since the end of last year. For roughly seven months from May to November, the city with one of the highest population densities in Brazil reported very few Covid-19 cases, despite considerable relaxation of restrictions.Researchers estimated that roughly three quarters of the population may have been infected, surpassing the theoretical herd immunity threshold. This partly supported the May-November lull in cases — until the outbreak exploded again.Researchers now believe there are four possible explanations for the lull and the resurgence — one, that the initial three-fourths attack rate was exaggerated and the population was never this protected; two, the seven-month period is when immunity from the first infection waned to cause re-infections; three, the new outbreak is triggered by a variant that is resistant to antibodies from previous immunity; and lastly, that a new variant that is more transmissible has taken hold.The strongest suspicion now falls on the variant known as P.1, which has a constellation of mutations including the N501Y from UK’s B.1.1.7 variant and a mutation at the location 484 (known as E484K). N501Y has been linked to the UK variant becoming more infective while E484K has shown to be more resistant to antibodies generated in response to the older virus.The link with Maharashtra Similar trends have also been seen in South Africa, where the variant B.1.351 too has E484K mutation. But the examples of UK, US and Brazil have significant overlaps with what has been observed in Maharashtra and what little is known about the virus there.The London-South-East England and California examples shows a sudden, relentless outbreak can be due to a fitter mutation – the latter case shares a particular mutation that has been found in Maharashtra.The Manaus example too reinforces the risk from mutations, but it also points to the fact that herd immunity may not translate to any sort of protection in a region such as Maharashtra, which has consistently had high levels of outbreak since the pandemic began in India.In all three cases, the outbreaks have spread out – driving new surges as the variants travel beyond states and borders.The lack of data from genomic surveillance means India is unlikely to determine whether Maharashtra’s worsening situation is due to something similar, and the longer that question remains unanswered, the more difficult it becomes to take proactive decisions on measures to tackle it — for Maharashtra itself as well as the rest of the country.India set up a consortium of labs called INSACOG and targeted genome sequencing of at least 5% of all positive. But since January, a little under 11,000 had been done — this number is short of the at least 48,000 it should have been, based on the 966,376 cases recorded in the country between January 1 and March 23.Experts have called on the government to increase the whole genome sequencing volumes. What could also help is if the government releases the timeline of the genomes sequenced till now, which determine how proportion of mutation samples change in a region — helping establish at least one proxy for epidemiological estimation.Determining the threat from variants is key not only to head off the current outbreak, but also to tweak India’s vaccination strategy — including the question whether the government now needs to look at approaching other developers with more immunogenic products.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uk-california-manaus-what-they-suggest-about-the-covid-crisis-in-maharashtra-101617628516252.html

The state and central government have deliberately done this. We also found that around 19,000 voters’ names, who are AMMK supporters, are missing,” he said. Sasikala’s counsel Raja Senthoor Panidan, who approached the election commission for her name to be included from the new address on March 17, said he came to know about her name deletion on March 16.“The very next day I met with chief election officer Satyabrata Sahoo but he said his powers to make any changes in the electoral rolls was only till March 9,” he added. According to Sasikala’s team members, besides her, names of other family members, including her sister-in-law J Ilavarasi, and workers who were living at late J Jayalalithaa’s Poes Garden residence, Veda Nilayam, have also been deleted after the AIADMK government acquired the residence for it to be converted into a memorial.A total of 19 people who were living in the house, including cook Rajammal who lived there for three decades, are missing from the electoral rolls, Sasikala’s team stated. The case to transform the residence is pending with the Madras High Court as Jayalalithaa’s niece and nephew have claimed the property as her legal heirs.The Chennai election office said that Sasikala’s name was deleted in 2019 itself before the Lok Sabha elections. “Only now it is being made into an issue,” said Thousand Lights’s assistant electoral rolls officer, Ravi Kumar.“We sent a notice to the concerned party asking if they are residing there and gave ample time but since we didn’t get any response, we had to delete the names as per the protocol. I have an election to conduct tomorrow and have given my detailed response to the election commission. They will give a reply to the media,” Kumar added.Sasikala and Ilavarasi were lodged in prison since February 2017 in Bengaluru in the disproportionate assets case and returned to Chennai in February this year after serving a four-year prison term. The two currently live in T Nagar in Chennai which also falls under the Thousand Lights constituency.“Just because the government took over the property, how can they delete the names without issuing any notice to us? As her advocate, we will seek action against the officer who deleted her name without a valid reason because of which she has lost her franchise,” Panidan said.According to the Representation of People’s Act, a person who is residing in a particular area can register for enrollment in electoral rolls by applying with booth level electoral officer with relevant proof of residence documents. While enrollment is a continuous process throughout the year, for election-bound states, the Election Commission has a cut-off date.“This cut-off date is to enable a level-playing field and to prevent last-minute addition to the electoral rolls. Also, most of the personnel engaged in updating electoral rolls are also deployed on election-related duty and therefore, the cut-off date is given. In exceptional cases, where the name of the person has been wrongly removed, the name can be added even after the cut-off date,” a senior election commission official said. He added that Sasikala was not residing at the Chennai address for several years and therefore, the election officers had the right to delete her name. The name could have been added had she applied on time, he added.Meanwhile, the AMMK candidate has written to the ECI for the election in the Thousand Lights constituency to be postponed until Sasikala’s name is included. In his letter, Sasikala is still addressed as the AIADMK’s general secretary. The AIADMK has abated the general secretary post and expelled Sasikala and Dhinakaran in September 2017.While Sasikala was still in jail, Dhinakaran floated the AMMK with a breakaway faction of her supporters. After her release, Sasikala made moves to reclaim the AIADMK but the party, under chief minister Edappadi Palaniswami, decided against taking her back and she decided to ‘step away’ from politics.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-caused-her-civil-death-ammk-candidate-on-sasikala-s-name-deletion-from-voters-list-101617627914699.html

Ram Kumar, an employee of a private oil drilling company was released at a remote location on the Indo-Myanmar border in Nagaland. His colleague, Pranab Kumar Gogoi from Assam, who was also abducted at the same time, was released on Saturday in Changlang district in Arunachal Pradesh. “Ram Kumar has been released in a village on the Indian side in Nagaland close to the Indo-Myanmar border. Nagaland Police handed him over to Assam Police,” Shwetank Mishra, superintendent of police, Charaideo district, Assam, said. He added that Kumar, who spent 105 days in custody of ULFA-I, appeared to be healthy. “I would like to thank Paresh Baruah (commander-in-chief of ULFA-I). He had called me over phone during the period in custody and assured me that I would be released as he doesn’t have any personal enmity with me,” Kumar told journalists after his release. Also Read | In Assam, the election is all about the arithmeticGogoi, a drilling superintendent, and Ram Kumar, a radio operator, employed with Quippo Oil and Gas Infrastructure Limited, a Delhi-based company, were abducted on December 21 from a drilling location in Changlang district. Following his release, Gogoi had said that both of them were kept together till March 4 after which they were separated by the banned outfit. On January 12, Paresh Baruah had admitted to abducting the two employees and told TV channels in Assam that Kumar, who hails from Bihar, would become a “victim” if the oil drilling company didn’t pay the outfit it’s “due share” for extracting natural resources from Assam and rest of northeast region. Baruah had said that Gogoi, who is an Assamese, won’t be harmed. Later, ULFA-I set a deadline till February 16 to complete talks and secure the release of the two abducted employees. It also said that chief ministers of Assam and Arunachal Pradesh would be held responsible if the two employees died in an “undesired incident”. In February this year, the outfit threatened to take ”final action” against Gogoi and Kumar in a phased manner since the deadline for talks as well as discussions with the company had failed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bihar-man-abducted-by-ulfa-i-from-arunachal-released-after-105-days-101617627614782.html

As the vaccination drive continuously upscales in India and guided by the learnings of India's successful management of pandemic during its first wave, India is now well armed to combat any downside risk posed by the recent surge in COVID-19 cases,"the report said.With the end of a challenging 2020-21, the crest of a brighter and self-reliant 2021-22 awaits India, the Finance Ministry report said. The fiscal position of the Centre has witnessed improvement in the recent months due to a revival in the economic activities, it said. "During April 2020 to February 2021, the Centre's fiscal deficit stood at ₹14.05 lakh crore, which is 76 per cent of Revised Estimate 2020-21. Net Tax Revenue of the Central Government for 2020-21 is set to overshoot the RE despite 41 per cent higher income tax refunds this year," it said. To share the revenue buoyancy seen in Q4 2020-21 and in the true spirit of fiscal federalism, an amount of ₹45,000 crore has been released as additional devolution to states in 2020-21, an increase of 8.2 per cent over RE, it said. The Centre raised ₹13.7 lakh crore as gross market borrowings during 2020-21 at a weighted average borrowing cost of 5.79 per cent - the lowest in 17 years, it said. The government's capital expenditure sharply turned around to grow at 104.4 per cent during October 2020 to February 2021 (YoY), recovering from a decline of 11.6 per cent in the first half of 2020-21 (YoY), it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-well-prepared-to-combat-second-wave-of-covid-19-finance-ministry-report-101617626644159.html

05-04-2021||India||Centre seeks listing of Isro spy case on Kerala poll eve, SC sees no urgency||The Supreme Court on Monday turned down the Centre’s plea for taking up on Tuesday a report by a committee headed by a retired apex court judge which probed the conspiracy behind framing former Indian Space Research Organization (Isro) scientist Nambi Narayanan in an alleged espionage case in 2014.The Supreme Court had in September 2018 directed the state government to award ₹50 lakh as compensation to Narayanan for his wrongful incarceration, malicious prosecution and humiliation suffered by him for being dragged in a false case by Kerala Police and state Intelligence bureau officials. The top court constituted a committee headed by retired SC judge DK Jain and sought a report on proposed action to be taken against the delinquent official of state police and IB. This committee submitted its report to the SC in a sealed cover recently. Also Read | SC junks Bihar’s plea, asks to pay ₹20,000 for ‘utter wastage’ of judicial timeSeeking urgent listing of the matter, the Centre, led by solictor general Tushar Mehta, mentioned the case for urgent listing on Tuesday before a three-judge bench headed by CJI SA Bobde. Mehta said the case involves a serious issue as the 79-year old scientist, who is a former Padma Bhushan awardee, was humiliated and tortured in a false case over alleged leak of secret classified information to enemy countries. The CBI, which probed the case, found the allegation false and a trial court acquitted Narayanan of serious charge under Official Secrets Act in 1998.The SC bench said, “We understand the importance of the case but there is no urgency.” The court directed the matter to be listed next week. The urgent mentioning by Centre has evoked some anxiety as Kerala goes to polls on Tuesday. The case against Narayanan was filed by the Congress government in the early 1990s. In its probe, the CBI found that a false case was concocted by the state police and named three officials of Kerala Police -- former DGP Siby Mathews, and retired superintendents of police KK Joshua and S Vijayan. In addition, the court also found fault with then IB deputy director RB Shreekumar. After his acquittal, Narayanan had approached Kerala high court for compensation. The same was denied following which he approached the apex court. The Justice Jain Committee also comprised a representative each of Centre and Kerala government. The contents of the report are not known as the same were filed in a sealed cover.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-seeks-listing-of-isro-spy-case-on-kerala-poll-eve-sc-sees-no-urgency-101617623474441.html

They are demanding a repeal of the three laws along with a legal guarantee for Minimum Support Price (MSP) for their produce.The protesting farmers took out a tractor rally in Delhi on January 26."Farmers will conduct an agitation in Gujarat using their tractors. Time has come to gherao Gandhinagar and block roads. If needed, we will have to break barricades too," Tikait said.The BKU leader is on a two-day tour of Gujarat since Sunday to campaign against the Centre's three farm laws.On the second day of his visit, Tikait, accompanied by former Gujarat chief minister Shankersinh Vaghela, paid tributes to Mahatma Gandhi at the Sabarmati Ashram."Farmers are suffering because there is no agitation here. There is no backing from courts also. Farmers are compelled to say they are happy and making profit. Please give us that technology which is helping Gujarat's farmers to reap benefits," said Tikait.He claimed farmers of Banaskantha are compelled to sell potatoes for ₹3 per kilogram."Is that enough to make farmers happy? We have come here to remove fear from the minds of farmers. We will agitate in a peaceful manner," Tikait said, when asked about his future plans for Gujarat.Later, Tikait and Vaghela reached Karamsad town in Anand district and paid tributes to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel at his native place.Tikait then headed to Bardoli in Surat, where he would address farmers in the evening.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bku-leader-rakesh-tikait-threatens-tractor-agitation-in-gujarat-after-delhi-101617622221251.html
05-04-2021||India||Kejriwal urges PM Modi to expand coverage of Covid-19 vaccination drive||Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeking speedy vaccination and its increased coverage for citizens in the national capital and the country.In his letter, Kejriwal requested PM Modi to relax conditions for opening new vaccination centres as well as relaxation in the age limit for vaccination and making it available for all.The request for a widespread vaccination plan by Kejriwal for citizens comes on a day when India marked a grim milestone by recording its highest ever single-day spike in the number of Covid-19 cases.India on Monday shattered its previous daily infection rate and recorded 1,03,558 new infections pushing the nationwide Covid-19 tally to 1,25,89,067, according to the Union health ministry data.The single-day rise in cases surpassed the earlier peak of 97,894 infections reported on September 17 last year. The fatalities due to the viral contagion also spiked sharply after 478 new deaths were recorded in the last 24 hours."The increase in the rate of transition of Corona across the country has presented new concerns and challenges. The vaccination campaign needs to move more rapidly in this context," Kejriwal wrote in the letter.If rules for opening new centres are simplified and everyone is allowed to be vaccinated irrespective of age, then the Delhi government can vaccinate all Delhi residents within three months, the Delhi CM reasoned."The rapid spread of infection between immunization campaigns in this way suggests that we must move the vaccination campaign forward in a more swift manner," the letter to the prime minister read.Suggesting a two-pronged approach, Kejriwal said, "First, there is an urgent need to increase the number of vaccination centers. For this, the pre-conditions placed by the Centre regarding vaccination centers need to be relaxed.""Second, it should be made available to everyone by removing the age limit to immunization. Except for those who cannot get vaccinated medically, we should start vaccinating everyone. This will remove the hesitation among people and increase the number of people getting vaccinated. The more people get vaccinated, the more we will be able to reduce the spread of the disease," he added.Kejriwal has told PM Modi that the vaccination drive has to be organised as a "war-level effort" in the fight."I hope the support that the Centre had extended to Delhi would continue and you would respond positively to my request," the CM said.The Covid-19 cases in India have surged at a rate higher than that witnessed last year. It took 76 days for the single-day numbers to reach the then peak of 97,894 (in September 2020) from 20,000. However, this time the daily rise in cases have galloped at a much faster pace taking just 25 days (March 10 to April 4) to cross the grim milestone of one-lakh infections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kejriwal-urges-pm-modi-to-expand-coverage-of-covid-19-vaccination-drive-101617621696600.html

India reported 103,558 fresh infections on Monday, the highest since the beginning of the pandemic, taking the nationwide tally to 12,589,067.Two days ago, Prime Minister Narendra Modi held a review meeting with officials where he discussed measures to reduce the number of cases in badly-hit states like Maharashtra, Punjab and Chhattisgarh. PM Modi also asked officials to implement the strategy of testing, tracing, treatment, and following Covid-appropriate behaviour and vaccination with seriousness in order to curb the spread of the pandemic.At PM's review meeting, it was pointed out that severe complacency in following Covid-19 preventative measures such as using masks and social distancing coupled with pandemic fatigue and lack of proper implementation of containment measures could have led to this major spike in the number of cases. It was also highlighted that 10 states are contributing more than 90% cases and related fatalities.India’s daily caseload dropped after September 17 last year and the gradual decline continued for five months before the current surge, which experts have described as the ‘second wave’. Maharashtra has contributed to the spike with 57,074 fresh infections along with Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Punjab, all of which reported highest-surge in daily Covid-19 infections. The Maharashtra government on Sunday announced weekend lockdown in the entire state and ordered closure of private offices, asking employees of such firms to work from home.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-surge-harsh-vardhan-to-meet-health-ministers-of-11-states-uts-101617621002191.html

05-04-2021||India||Centre seeks urgent hearing in ISRO espionage case, SC to hear matter next week||The Centre Monday moved the Supreme Court seeking urgent hearing on the report filed by a high-level committee regarding the role of erring police officials in the 1994 espionage case relating to ISRO scientist Nambi Narayanan who had been acquitted and was eventually awarded ₹50 lakh compensation by the top court.The matter was mentioned for urgent hearing by Solicitor General Tushar Mehta before a bench, headed by Chief Justice S A Bobde, which said that the case would be heard next week.Mehta told the bench, also comprising Justices A S Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian, that the report has been filed by the committee and it be considered as this is a “national issue”.The bench said it understands that it is an important matter but “not a very urgent matter”.“We will take it up next week,” the bench said.The apex court had on September 14, 2018 appointed a three-member panel, headed by its former judge Justice (retd) D K Jain, while directing the Kerala government to cough up ₹50 lakh compensation for compelling Narayanan to undergo "immense humiliation".It had ordered setting up of the committee to take appropriate steps against the erring officials for causing "tremendous harassment" and "immeasurable anguish" to Narayanan and had directed the Centre and state government to nominate one officer each in the panel.Terming the police action against the ex-scientist of the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) as a "psycho-pathological treatment", the apex court had in September 2018 said that his "liberty and dignity", basic to his human rights, were jeopardised as he was taken into custody and, eventually, despite all the glory of the past, was compelled to face "cynical abhorrence".The espionage case, which had hit the headlines in 1994, pertained to allegations of transfer of certain confidential documents on India's space programme to foreign countries by two scientists and four others, including two Maldivian womenThe scientist was arrested when the Congress was heading the government in Kerala.The three-member investigation panel submitted its report in a sealed cover to the apex court recently.The CBI, in its probe, had held that the then top police officials in Kerala were responsible for Narayanan's illegal arrest.The case also had its political fallout, with a section in the Congress targeting the then Chief Minister late K Karunakaran over the issue, that eventually led to his resignation.Over a period of almost two-and-a-half years, the panel headed by Justice Jain examined the circumstances leading to the arrest.The 79-year-old former scientist, who was given a clean chit by the CBI, had earlier said that the Kerala police had "fabricated" the case and the technology he was accused to have stolen and sold in the 1994 case did not even exist at that time.Narayanan had approached the apex court against a Kerala High Court judgement that said no action needed to be taken against former DGP Siby Mathews, who was then heading the SIT probe team, and two retired superintendents of police K K Joshua and S Vijayan, who were later held responsible by the CBI for the scientist's illegal arrest."There can be no scintilla of doubt that the appellant, a successful scientist having national reputation, has been compelled to undergo immense humiliation. The lackadaisical attitude of the state police to arrest anyone and put him in police custody has made the appellant to suffer the ignominy,” the apex court had said in its September 2018 order."The dignity of a person gets shocked when psycho-pathological treatment is meted out to him. A human being cries for justice when he feels that the insensible act has crucified his self-respect," the top court had said.It had accepted Narayanan's plea that the authorities, who were responsible for causing such a "harrowing effect" on his mind, should face "legal consequences".The CBI, while giving clean chit to the scientist, had said that Siby Mathews had left "the entire investigation to IB surrendering his duties" and ordered indiscriminate arrest of the scientist and others without adequate evidence being on record.The case had caught attention in October 1994, when Maldivian national Rasheeda was arrested in Thiruvananthapuram for allegedly obtaining secret drawings of ISRO rocket engines to sell to Pakistan.Narayanan, the then director of the cryogenic project at ISRO, was arrested along with the then ISRO Deputy Director D Sasikumaran, and Fousiya Hasan, a Maldivian friend of Rasheeda.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-seeks-urgent-hearing-in-isro-espionage-case-sc-to-hear-matter-next-week-101617618395094.html
05-04-2021||India||'Govt exported 64.5 million Covid-19 vaccines, haven't inoculated these many here': AAP||The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Monday questioned the Centre on its vaccine diplomacy. The party said that instead of sending “64.5 million” doses of Covid-19 vaccines all over the world, the government could have accelerated the nationwide vaccination drive.“The government has exported 64.5 million doses of the vaccine to 84 countries, they haven’t vaccinated these many people in their own country yet,” AAP spokesperson Raghav Chadha while addressing a press conference in the national capital."Where has the Centre's vaccine nationalism gone? The AAP demands an increase in the rate of vaccinations against Covid-19 so that each and every Indian can get vaccinated," Chadha told reporters.“The rate at which we are vaccinating our citizens, it will take 15 years to vaccinate the entire population,” said Chadha.“The ministry of external affairs said a few days ago that India is competing with China in terms of exporting vaccines. Proudly stating that India is ahead of China in terms of vaccine diplomacy. A country which has a total of 90,000 Covid-19 cases is being compared to a country where 90,000 cases are recorded everyday,” Chadha told reporters at the press conference.Chadha read out the names of the countries where vaccines have been exported, jocularly adding that vaccines have been exported to countries whose names he's hearing for the first time.The AAP leader's comments came days after Delhi chief minister and party president Arvind Kejriwal urged the centre to open up vaccination for everyone. The Centre recently allowed all those above the age of 45 to take Covid-19 vaccine. This expanded the scope of the second phase of the drive in which people above the age of 60 and 45+ with comorbidities were being inoculated. From May 1, the drive will open for everyone between the age of 35 and 45.Many experts have been sounding alarm bells over the deteriorating situation in the country in the wake of the rising number of Covid-19 cases. They have urged the Centre to inoculate more people.India has so far administered 7,91,05,163 of the Covid-19 vaccines in 12,31,148 sessions, according to the ministry of health and family welfare’s dashboard. These numbers remain significantly behind the government’s inoculation targets - the Centre has set a target of vaccinating over 300 million people by the end of July.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-exported-64-5-million-covid-19-vaccines-haven-t-inoculated-these-many-here-aap-101617621217334.html

Two Indian warships and a long-range maritime patrol aircraft are taking part in the French Navy-led exercise called La Pérouse for the first time. India, the US, Japan and Australia constitute the Quadrilateral security or Quad. China has been wary of the Quad that was revived in late 2017. And Beijing’s suspicions have increased since the four countries upgraded the forum to the ministerial level in 2019. Indian warships INS Satpura with an embarked helicopter and INS Kiltan, and a Boeing P-8I submarine hunter aircraft are taking part in the three-day exercise being held from April 5 to April 7. The exercise will showcase high levels of synergy, coordination and inter-operability between the friendly navies, an Indian Navy spokesperson said on Monday. “Participation by the Indian Navy in the exercise demonstrates the shared values with friendly navies ensuring freedom of seas and commitment to an open, inclusive Indo-Pacific and a rules-based international order,” Commander Vivek Madhwal said. Also Read | Amid rising Covid cases, Raisina Dialogue to go fully digitalFrance is being represented at the multi-lateral exercise by amphibious assault ship Tonnerre and frigate Surcouf, the US Navy has sent its amphibious transport dock USS Somerset for the drills, Australia has deployed its frigate HMAS Anzac and tanker Sirius, and Japan has sent Akebono, a destroyer, for the drills. “Exercise La Pérouse will witness complex and advanced naval operations including surface warfare, anti-air warfare and air defence exercises, weapon-firing exercises, cross-deck flying operations, tactical manoeuvres and seamanship evolutions such as replenishment at sea,” he said. Last November, navy chief Admiral Karambir Singh said a “great power competition” was playing out vigorously in IOR, where the navy has stepped up surveillance to check China’s ambitions. “IOR is one of the most militarised regions… Also, there are differing interpretations of international laws and there is this fear that ‘Global Commons’ can change to ‘Contested Seas’, threatening free flow of commerce and trade,” the navy chief then said. From carrying out naval drills with like-minded countries to reaching out to states in IOR, the Indian Navy is focusing on checking China’s rising ambitions in the region and sending out a strong message that Beijing’s power play in South China Sea cannot be replicated in the Indian Ocean, as previously reported by Hindustan Times.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/quad-navies-join-france-led-drills-in-indian-ocean-101617621554810.html
05-04-2021||India||Anil Deshmukh out, BJP’s Ravi Shankar Prasad aims next at Uddhav Thackeray||Shortly after Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh resigned over corruption allegations, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) said targeted chief minister Uddhav Thackeray. BJP leader and Union minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said that Thackeray has lost the moral right to govern."I find it interesting that Anil Deshmukh has taken moral responsibility. How about responsibility of CM? Uddhav Thackeray has forfeited the moral responsibility to govern," Prasad said.In the resignation letter he posted on Twitter, Anil Deshmukh said that he doesn't find it morally correct to continue as the home minister after the order of Bombay high court, which gave a go-ahead to Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to conduct a preliminary investigation against the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader.The allegations were made by former Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh, who said in a letter to Thackeray that Deshmukh asked suspended cop Sachin Vaze to collect ₹100 crore per month from hotels and bars in the city. Singh sent the letter to Thackeray after being transferred to Home Guards, a "low-key" post. He was shunted out after mishandling of the Mukesh Ambani bomb scare case.Vaze was arrested by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) in the same case and is also being probed in connection with the death of Thane businessman Mansukh Hiran whose car was found with gelatin sticks near Ambani's residence Antilia in Mumbai.On Monday, Prasad questioned the silence of Maharastra chief minister on the entire issue."When will CM Udhhav Thackeray speak? The consistent, conspicuous silence of Uddhav Thackeray is itself raising a lot of questions. NIA is finding out new details of Sachin Vaze everyday, new details of how many cars he has," said the Union minister."The BJP expects that all the ramifications of this issue ought to be investigated fairly and those who are responsible must be brought to book," he added.Maharashtra BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis too has attacked Thackeray, asking him to sack Deshmukh if he doesn't resign. The Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), which is part of the ruling Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) alliance, has been defending Deshmukh but was under pressure, especially after the high court order on Monday.A meeting of NCP leaders took place at party chief Sharad Pawar's residence, and it was expected that he will ask Deshmukh to resign.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/thackeray-has-lost-moral-responsibility-to-govern-bjp-after-deshmukh-resigns-101617619343011.html

Our Jawans are not cannon fodder to be martyred at will,” Gandhi tweeted.If there was no intelligence failure then a 1:1 death ratio means it was a poorly designed and incompetently executed operation.Our Jawans are not cannon fodder to be martyred at will. pic.twitter.com/JDgVc03QvDThe Congress leader also cited a media report quoting Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) director general Kuldiep Singh as saying there was no intelligence failure in the operation and an equal number of Maoists were killed in Chhattisgarh, which is ruled by his party. "There is no point in saying that there was some kind of intelligence or operational failure. Had it been some intelligence failure, forces would have not gone for the operation. And if there was some operational failure, so many Naxals would have not been killed," Singh, who visited Chhattisgarh following the attack, told news agency ANI on Sunday.Out of the 22 security personnel killed after Saturday’s ambush in Chhattisgarh’s Bastar region, CRPF lost eight men, including seven commandos of its elite CoBRA, one jawan was from the Bastariya battalion, eight from the District Reserve Guard (DRG) and five from the Special Task Force. In addition to the fatalities, 30 others were also wounded in a four-hour gun battle with the Maoists. The attack, which took place near the Bijapur-Sukma border, came during a combing operation for wanted Maoist commander Madvi Hidma.Gandhi also said all Indian soldiers should get body armours. “No Indian jawan should face an enemy without body armour in the 21st century. It needs to be made available to every soldier,” tweeted Gandhi.Meanwhile, Union home minister Amit Shah said the government is determined to end the Maoist menace during his visit to Chhattisgarh. Shah also chaired a meeting attended by chief minister Bhupesh Baghel, senior officials of the state police and CRPF, to review the security situation. “I want to assure the country that this fight will not be stopped, rather it will continue with more intensity till the end. In this fight, our victory is definite in the end,” Shah said.The former Congress president took to Twitter to condole the deaths of the personnel on Sunday, calling for decisive action on locating and rescuing the missing jawans, and requesting the state government to ensure a speedy recovery for the injured.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jawans-are-not-cannon-fodder-rahul-gandhi-days-after-chhattisgarh-maoist-attack-101617618822007.html

Out of which, 15,40,676 people were vaccinated across 21,508 sessions for the first dose and 97,788 received the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine.The ministry said that eight states account for 60% of the cumulative vaccine doses given so far. Maharashtra, which is India’s worst-affected state, alone accounts for 9.72% of the total doses given in the country, it added.Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan on April 3 directed all states and Union territories to immediately stop new registrations for Covid shots in the categories of healthcare and frontline workers. Bhushan said that ineligible beneficiaries are getting the Covid-19 vaccine. “Various inputs have been received from different sources that in some of the CVCs (Covid Vaccination Centres) some ineligible beneficiaries are being registered as healthcare workers and frontline workers and are getting vaccinated in complete violation of the prescribed guidelines,” he said in a letter.The vaccination drive that started on January 16 was meant to first immunise 300 million people who belong to three categories-- healthcare workers, frontline workers and those at greater risk from coronavirus disease due to their age or existing medical conditions. The first to receive the shots were 10 million healthcare workers and the drive was opened up to 20 million front line workers from February 1 onwards. On March 1, the government allowed people above the age of 60 and those between the ages of 45 and 59 years with a combination of 20 specified comorbidities to take the jabs. On April 1, the government relaxed it further to allow anyone above the age of 45 to take the dose.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/over-79-million-covid-19-vaccine-doses-administered-in-india-health-ministry-101617605223335.html

He also chaired a meeting that was attended by chief minister Bhupesh Baghel, and senior officials of the state police, and the Central Reserve Police Force, to review the security situation arising out of the Maoist attack. In Jagdalpur, Shah paid his last respects at the Police Lines, where the mortal remains of 14 personnel were kept in coffins draped with the national flag.Besides Shah, Chhattisgarh chief minister Bhupesh Baghel and other dignitaries were also present for the wreath-laying ceremony. Later, tweeting about it in Hindi, he said, “Paid tributes to the brave security personnel who were martyred while fighting the naxalites at Jagdalpur in Chhattisgarh.” “The country will never forget your bravery and sacrifice. The whole country stands behind the bereaved families. We are determined to take the ongoing fight against the unrest created by the Naxals to its logical conclusion,” he said.After the review meeting at the Police Coordination Centre in Jagdalpur, Shah said that the fight against Maoists will be intensified to end the menace. “I want to assure the country that this fight will not be stopped, rather it will continue with more intensity till the end. In this fight, our victory is definite in the end,” Shah said.Also Read | Maoist attack: How Sikh jawan took off turban to help wounded colleagueSpeaking to journalists after the review meeting, Baghel said the fight against Maoists will continue. “In the last few years, we have managed to establish camps in their core area and more camps will be opened soon. The development works will also be accelerated in the area,” he said. After paying tribute to the security forces personnel in Jagdalpur, the CM said, “I salute their sacrifice and express my condolences to their families. Our forces have fought bravely with courage causing huge damage to the Maoists.” He said that Maoists are rattled because the forces are going to establish a new camp in Tarrem area. “Central and state governments are working together to accelerate the development works in the area. Efforts are being made to provide connectivity with construction of roads and to extend the benefits of the schemes to the interior areas. Meaningful discussions have taken place in the meeting with the home minister and we are hopeful that the Centre will take appropriate steps to fulfil our demands,” said Baghel. During his visit, Shah is also slated to meet some of the injured security personnel in hospital. At least two dozen others were injured in Saturday’s attack.The gunfight also resulted in the death of a suspected Maoist, the police said. Intel inputs suggest that the extremists used grenade launchers in the ambush, according to home ministry and Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) officials. Surveillance inputs captured by a Heron drone indicated that two tractor-trolleys were used to ferry the dead extremists back into deep forests.Chhattisgarh’s worst Maoist attack in four years also triggered a political slugfest. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi alleged that the anti-Maoist operation was “incompetently” executed and “poorly designed” even as his party’s chief minister Bhupesh Baghel was already under Opposition fire for being away, campaigning in Assam. “Our jawans are not cannon fodder to be martyred at will,” Gandhi tweeted.Citing a media report quoting CRPF Director General Kuldeep Singh as saying there was no intelligence failure in the operation and an equal number of ultras were killed, Gandhi said, “If there was no intelligence failure then a 1:1 death ratio means it was a poorly designed and incompetently executed operation.” The security personnel were ambushed on a combing operation in a forest along the border of the Bijapur and Sukma districts of the state.Senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader and former Chhattisgarh chief minister Raman Singh hit out at Baghel on Sunday, saying, “He is holding rallies there (in Assam), taking out marches ...dancing there ...after such a big incident ...elections have become the chief minister’s first priority...”.While Baghel returned to Chhattisgarh on Sunday evening, his party accused the BJP of politicising the martyrdom of the personnel.“Raman Singh should first answer what Amit Shah was doing? Was he campaigning in Assam or not? There is no need to politicise Maoist violence. We all know that Maoists are a national problem and both the state and Central governments are working on it,” said Congress spokesperson Shailesh Nitin Trivedi.The BJP also demanded fixing of responsibility for the operation that went wrong even as the CRPF ruled out intelligence or operational failure. Leader of the Opposition in the state assembly, Dharamlal Kaushik, said responsibility must be fixed for the operation which went wrong despite the “input of presence of a large number of Maoists”.In the wake of the Maoist ambush, police in neighbouring Telangana has sounded an alert and intensified combing operations and beefed up security in the bordering areas of the state.The Telangana Police have mounted vigil particularly in Bhadradri Kothagudem and Mulugu districts, a senior police official told news agency PTI. “We are alert and regular combing operations are going on. In view of the [Chhattisgarh Maoist attack], combing has been intensified and security has been beefed up in areas (near the Telangana-Chhattisgarh border),” the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-will-end-maoist-menace-says-amit-shah-on-chhattisgarh-visit-101617616994252.html

Their leaders say they are fighting on behalf of the poorest, who have not benefited from the economic boom in Asia's third-largest economy.Shah told reporters the government will "not tolerate such bloodshed and a befitting response will be given to put an end to the ongoing battle with Maoists".Security experts said the latest attack by Maoist rebels, considered India's biggest internal security threat, has forced Prime Minister Narendra Modi's right-wing government to re-evaluate counter-insurgency operations against the ultra left-wing fighters, who have been able to increase new followers during the pandemic."In the last few years the Maoists have had opportunity to regroup themselves in their core region of dominance," said Uddipan Mukherjee, a joint director for government agency, the Ordnance Factory Board. He has been researching the Maoist strategy for more than a decade.Mukherjee and others with expert knowledge said the pandemic had allowed the insurgency to recruit more to its cause."We have intelligence reports that the Maoist leaders during the pandemic have managed to recruit hundreds of new foot soldiers, including women, living in the forests who leak details about security force patrols," a New Delhi-based bureaucrat who oversees country's internal security said."The pandemic has made the intra-state movement of Maoist leaders much easier," the senior official said on condition of anonymity as he is not authorised to speak to the media.Chhattisgarh, one of the fastest-developing states in India, has 28 varieties of major minerals, including diamonds and gold, a government website said. The state has 16% of India's coal deposits and large reserves of iron ore and bauxite.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-grapples-with-rising-maoist-violence-fuelled-by-pandemic-101617616227893.html

A three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde stayed the January 5,2021 order passed by Karnataka high court restoring the criminal case against Yediyurappa and two others. Earlier, the SC had stayed their arrest while taking up Yediyurappa’s appeal against the high court order. On Monday, senior advocate KV Vishwanathan, appearing for the Karnataka CM, said that despite stay of arrest, the trial was proceeding against him and that needs to be stayed. Also Read | ISRO espionage case: SC-appointed probe panel submits reportThe bench, also comprising justices AS Bopanna and V Ramsubramanian, agreed to grant stay as it is examining the legal questions raised in Yediyurappa’s appeal. The allegation was made against Yeddyurappa by public spirited persons led by A Alam Pasha, alleging that during his tenure as CM between 2008-11, he denotified 26 acres land acquired by the government for construction of houses for low income and middle income families. This project was part of an upcoming IT park project at Devanahalli Industrial Park in Bengaluru Rural district. A Bengaluru court had ordered investigation by State Lokayukta in May 2012 on Pasha’s complaint. In June 2013, Yediyurappa, along with former industries minister Murugesh Nirani and two others, was framed for alleged forgery and provisions under Prevention of Corruption Act. He took the matter to Karnataka high court which set aside the criminal case against the accused in October 2013 citing lack of sanction to prosecute Yediyurappa. This led to dismissal of case by the trial judge on August 26, 2016.Pasha later challenged this order, resulting in the order of January 5 this year. The high court held in its order that since Yediyurappa had demitted office in 2011, taking sanction was not necessary. Yediyurappa had challenged this finding of the high court, claiming fresh sanction will be necessary to proceed further.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-stays-trial-proceedings-against-k-taka-cmyediyurappa-101617613093883.html
05-04-2021||India||After French report on Rafale payment, Congress demands independent inquiry||The Congress on Monday demanded an independent inquiry and posed five questions to the Narendra Modi government after a French journal alleged the Rafale deal involved payment of 1.1 million euros to an Indian middleman, and asked if the latest revelation has vitiated India’s biggest defence deal. Referring to the first of a three-part series by Mediapart, Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said, “Was the payment of €1.1 million shown by Dassault as ‘gifts to clients’ in reality a commission paid to middleman for the Rafale Deal? How can ‘middleman’ and ‘payment of commission’ be permitted in a ‘government to government defence contract’ or in any defence procurement in India in violation of the mandatory defence procurement procedure?” Arguing that the latest media report vitiated the Rafale deal, Surjewala said the revelation entailed imposition of heavy financial penalties on Dassault, banning of the company, registration of an FIR and other penal consequences.Also Read | 3 more Rafales land in India; IAF thanks UAE for mid-air refueling“Does it now not require a full and independent investigation into India’s biggest defence deal to find out as to how much bribery and commission in reality, if any, was paid and to whom in the Indian government?” the Congress said, asking if Prime Minister Narendra Modi would answer to the nation on this. According to the French report, the country’s anti-corruption agency AFA found the payment was made in October 2018 and questioned Dassault, the manufacturer of Rafale fighter jets. The report said that the jet-makers have not been able to answer the queries. The Congress demanded that the standard procedure—lodging an FIR, independent investigation and related moves—must follow and reminded the government that during the UPA rule, then defence minister AK Antony had followed the stipulated procedure in the case of AgustaWestland. The Opposition party said that defence procurement has an “integrity clause” that says there can be no middleman or payment of commission or bribe. “Any evidence of middleman or commission or bribery has serious penal consequences of banning of the supplier defence company, cancellation of contract, registration of FIR and imposition of heavy financial penalties on the defence supplier company,” said Surjewala. After the report was released, Union minister of law and justice Ravi Shankar Prasad called it baseless and said, “It’s completely baseless. The Supreme Court, CAG found nothing wrong.”The National Democratic Alliance’s decision to enter a $8.7 billion government-to-government deal with France to buy 36 Rafale warplanes made by Dassault was announced in April 2015, with an agreement signed a little over a year later. This replaced the previous United Progressive Alliance (UPA) regime’s decision to buy 126 Rafale aircraft, 108 of which were to be made in India by the state-owned Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd (HAL).The deal became controversial, with the Opposition, led by the Congress, claiming that the price at which India is buying Rafale aircraft now is ₹1,670 crore for each, three times the initial bid of ₹526 crore by the company when the UPA was trying to buy the aircraft. It has also claimed the previous deal included a technology transfer agreement with HAL. The NDA has not disclosed details of the price, but the UPA deal, struck in 2012, was not a viable one, former defence minister Manohar Parrikar has previously said, implying that it would have never been closed and that, therefore, any comparison is moot. Indeed, the UPA was not able to close the deal till 2014, largely over discussions related to pricing of items not included in the initial bid.The NDA government has said that it cannot disclose the details of the price on two counts: a confidentiality agreement with France, and the strategic reason of not showing its hand to India’s enemies; however, it said that the current deal also includes customised weaponry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-french-report-on-rafale-payment-congress-demands-independent-inquiry-101617612494051.html

05-04-2021||India||In election season, the raids are back—against Opposition leaders||Four states — West Bengal, Assam, Tamil Nadu, Kerala—and one union territory—Puducherry—are currently in the middle of an intense political campaign for state assembly elections.But what they also have in common are political leaders, primarily those belonging to parties other than the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), who are facing significant raids, summons and arrests by country’s top agencies—the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), the Enforcement Directorate (ED), National Investigation Agency (NIA) and the Income Tax department—over the last few months. Opposition parties have repeatedly alleged that they are being targeted at the behest of Centre, a charge denied by the ruling party and Central agencies. In the south, a string of casesIn its latest action, on Friday, the income tax (I-T) department raided the premises of Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) chief MK Stalin’s son-in-law Sabareesan’s residence as well as the premises of DMK leader Senthil Balaji, claiming the searches were part of unearthing “political cash distribution”.In September 2020, the CBI registered a case against DMK leader Poonjolai Srinivasan in connection with the recovery of ₹11 crore in a raid by the I-T department. The same month, ED issued an order seizing properties worth ₹89 crore of DMK Lok Sabha Member of Parliament S Jagathrakshakan for alleged violation of the foreign exchange management act. Also Read | Tamil Nadu: An election that is Stalin’s to loseCentral agencies, particularly the ED, have also been active in another key poll-bound state – Kerala—with ED itself now facing a state police First Information Report (FIR) for allegedly forcing an accused—Swapna Suresh—in the gold smuggling scam to name chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan. The central anti-money laundering agency also arrested suspended IAS officer—M Sivasankar, former principal secretary to Vijayan, in connection with the gold smuggling scam in October 2020, while both NIA and Customs also arrested multiple accused in the case. The ED, last month, also registered a foreign exchange violation case against officials of Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board (KIIFB) for external borrowings through Masala Bonds without the Centre’s nod. Vijayan is Chairman of the Board and the Communist Party of India (Marxist), or CPI(M), alleges that ED wants to target him. Prior to this, ED arrested Bineesh, son of CPI(M) state secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan in a money laundering case in August 2020. Vijayan, while addressing the media last month, targeted the BJP saying, “The Central agencies would have seen people who surrender before them. They would have seen Congress leaders who can be cowed down. But that will not work here. This is Kerala. People will not remain silent when BJP and Congress come together to destroy the state.” Investigations in the eastIn West Bengal, while the main adversaries—Trinamool Congress (TMC) and the BJP—battle it out on the streets, several TMC leaders, and businessmen associated with them, are under the CBI and ED scanners in Ponzi scams (Saradha and Rose Valley chit fund schemes), and for illegal coal mining and cattle smuggling. The CBI, last month, examined Mamata Banerjee’s nephew and TMC’s de facto number 2, Abhishek Banerjee’s wife Rujira, his in-laws Menaka Gambhir and Ankush Arora. The case, registered in November 2020, relates to illegal coal mining operations worth over ₹1200 crore at the Eastern Coalfields Ltd mines in West Bengal’s Kunustoria and Kajora areas. In fact, both CBI and ED have raided over 100 places on different dates in West Bengal and other states in connection with this case. The ED, last week, also arrested Vikas Mishra, the brother of TMC youth leader Vinay Mishra, as part of its money laundering probe in a multi-crore cattle smuggling case, registered first in 2020. The BJP had earlier alleged that kickbacks from the cattle smuggling used to reach Abhishek Banerjee through Vinay Mishra. Also Read | In Bengal, the battle for Mahishya vote and the politics of turning OBCSimilarly, probing Saradha scam, the ED on March 19 questioned two TMC leaders—Madan Mitra, West Bengal’s former transport minister who is contesting from the Kamarhati constituency in North 24 Parganas, and Vivek Gupta, a former TMC MP who has been fielded from the Jorasanko assembly constituency in Kolkata. In the same scam, the ED, on Saturday, attached properties of party spokesperson Kunal Ghosh and its Lok Sabha Member of Parliament Satabdi Roy. Ghosh was questioned last month in the case. On March 15, the CBI also summoned Mamata Banerjee’s close aide, Partha Chatterjee, in connection with its 2014 probe into a ponzi scam pertaining to ICore Group of Companies, which allegedly raised over ₹3,000 crore from people by offering high returns on investments and diverted a portion of these funds. The National Investigation Agency (NIA), last Sunday, also arrested Trinamool Congress leader Chhatradhar Mahato, the poster boy of the Maoist-backed tribal-movement in Lalgarh during 2008-2011, who was inducted into party last year by TMC to woo tribal votes. Mahato was given the responsibility of at least 10 constituencies in three districts by TMC ahead of the first phase of polls. Other than that, several top officials in Bengal have been summoned by ED and CBI—including state security advisor Surajit Kar Purakayastha, principal secretary in the CM’s office, Gautam Sanyal, state additional chief secretary B P Gopalika, and Kolkata additional police commissioner Laxmi Narayan Meena in separate cases. Mamata Banerjee has repeatedly said in the last few weeks, during her public appearances, that BJP’s only allies are now CBI and ED. She wrote to 15 Opposition leaders on March 31 urging them to unite against BJP to defend democracy and claimed that the BJP government at the Centre has been brazenly and vindictively using CBI and ED in the functioning of non-BJP states. In Assam, the NIA arrested peasant leader Akhil Gogoi in December 2019 for anti-national activities. While jailed, he is contesting elections from Sibsagar constituency after launching a party—Raijor Dal—about five months back. The spike in action against Opposition leaders was also visible during the 2019 Lok Sabha elections as well as assembly elections in Maharashtra, Karnataka, Rajasthan and Jammu and Kashmir. For example, the I-T department raided the premises of Karnataka Congress leader DK Shivakumar for several days in August 2017 when he was playing a role in securing Ahmed Patel’s Rajya Sabha re-election by hosting legislators from Gujarat in Karnataka. In July last year, after a rebellion by Sachin Pilot against Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot, multiple raids were carried out by I-T on several politicians and businessmen in the state. Gehlot’s brother, Agrasain Gehlot, immediately faced an ED probe in a fertilisers scam and was even summoned. The politics behind the raids The BJP has denied that the raids have any political subtext and attribute it to the law taking its own course. According to BJP’s Nalin Kohli, “This is best answered by the agencies directly who are constantly criticised when they act or when they don’t.”The Opposition doesn’t buy the government’s version. Congress MP Manish Tewari said, “The National Democratic Alliance-BJP government has four frontal organisations—the IT, ED, CBI and the NIA. They have, over the past seven years, normalised the misuse/abuse of the State. India is now staring at an abyss. And even the shreds of moral or constitutional behaviour lie shattered and ripped by these people.” The Central agencies did not officially comment on the raids and summons to Opposition leaders before elections but several officers HT spoke to deny allegations of “political misuse”. A CBI officer, who didn’t want to be named, said, “The raids and summons are crucial part of process in CBI, and the time is decided only after certain allegations are verified or Investigation Officer feels he/she need clarification.” But others were more candid. A former head of one of the top agencies, requesting anonymity, agreed they face some pressure from dispensation to act against Opposition leaders. “It is true action intensifies around elections, particularly in those cases which were lying unattended for years. But, this happens in all governments.” Political analysts believe the issue reflects a systemic crisis in the political structure and spans across governments, though there have been questions raised about the degree to which such raids and investigations have increased under the current government. Sandeep Shastri, author and political scientist said, “I think this is not a challenge just with the current government. If you look at the last two-three decades, irrespective of which party has been at the Centre, they have tried to use the public institutions to their benefit. There needs to be stronger and vigilant public campaign to ensure autonomy of these agencies”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-election-season-the-raids-are-back-against-opposition-leaders-101617609673969.html

05-04-2021||India||Amid rising Covid cases, Raisina Dialogue to go fully digital||The organisers of Raisina Dialogue, the external affairs ministry’s flagship conference on geo-politics and geo-economics, announced on Monday that the event will be fully digital instead of a hybrid affair because of a spike in Covid-19 cases around the world.A number of in-person meetings between external affairs minister S Jaishankar and his counterparts from several countries had been planned on the margins of the Raisina Dialogue, and the list of foreign dignitaries who will make in-person visits is still being worked out, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity.The Observer Research Foundation and the ministry, which jointly organise the Raisina Dialogue, had earlier planned to hold the event with limited in-person attendance of around 100 people, including foreign dignitaries, within a bubble in New Delhi. The event is scheduled for April 13-15.Also Read | ‘Build on Pangong Lake drawdown, disengage at other points’: India tells China“The organisers of Raisina Dialogue 2021 have decided to host this year’s edition as a fully digital event, instead of the hybrid event planned earlier that envisaged both online as well as in-person speakers and delegates,” external affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said.The decision to move to a fully digital version was made as a “measure of abundant caution, given the Covid-19 situation in various parts of the world”, he said.“It underlines the strong sense of responsibility that the organisers feel towards the safety of all those involved with the dialogue,” he added.India has become only the second country in the world, after the US, to add more than 100,000 Covid-19 cases in a single day at any time during the pandemic. According to data from the health ministry on Monday, the country recorded 103,796 cases in the past 24 hours.The day’s spike pushed India’s infection tally up to 12.5 million, according to the health ministry’s dashboard.Bagchi said the fully digital Raisina Dialogue will use technology to give participants an opportunity to engage and debate on the most pressing issues facing the global community while avoiding any Covid-19-related risk.“The impact of the change in format will be appropriately reflected in our diplomatic engagements,” he added.Jaishankar and his French counterpart Jean-Yves Le Drian were expected to hold separate trilateral meetings with Australian foreign minister Marise Payne and Indonesian foreign minister Retno Marsudi. Jaishankar was also expected to hold bilateral meetings with leaders such as Maldives foreign minister Abdulla Shahid.There were already questions about an in-person visit by Marsudi, given Indonesia’s leading role in efforts by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) to address the situation in Myanmar following the February 1 coup.More than a dozen foreign and defence ministers had been listed among the speakers at the Raisina Dialogue. There is still a possibility that some leaders, who had planned bilateral engagements, will go ahead with their visits and the list is still being worked out, people familiar with developments said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amid-rising-covid-cases-raisina-dialogue-to-go-fully-digital-101617607574419.html

05-04-2021||India||Explained: African Swine Fever, suspected, after over 80 pigs die in Mizoram||After more than 80 pigs died in south Mizoram's Lunglei district over the last two weeks, the cause of their death has been suspected to be the African Swine Fever (ASF). The first death was reported on March 21, according to officials, after which veterinary officers were sent to the district to ascertain the cause. The confirmatory test for ASF is yet to be done at the National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases (NIHSAD) in Madhya Pradesh, but the deaths have triggered fears in the state government which has already sounded alert for the disease.What is the African Swine Fever?African Swine Fever is a deathly and contagious viral disease which affects both domestic as well as wild pigs of all ages. The disease is not a threat to human health as it cannot be transmitted from pigs to humans. The case fatality ratio (CFR) of the disease is almost 100 per cent and the disease can be transmitted through direct contact with the infected pig (alive or dead) or the wild pig (alive or dead), indirect contact through consumption of contaminated food waste, garbage by the swine.What are the symptoms of the disease?The symptoms of the disease include high fever, loss of appetite, weakness, red skin, skin lesions, diarrhoea, vomiting and difficulty in breathing, among others. The disease can cause sudden death in pigs. The disease has no approved vaccine and therefore culling of animals is required to prevent the spread of the infection.When was the last outbreak of the disease in the world?The disease was reported in China in August 2018 and by September 2018, the country had culled more than 38,000 hogs. By December, the disease spread in at least 23 provinces and municipalities across China. In 2019, the disease was reported in almost all regions of China as well as in southeast Asia which included Cambodia, Laos, Thailand and Vietnam. Due to the disease, the pig population in China declined by almost 100 million in 2019 as compared to the previous year. The disease later spread to the Philippines, South Korea, East Timor and Taiwan within the year 2019.Has the disease ever affected India?The disease was first reported in India in April 2020 in Assam and Arunachal Pradesh. According to the official data available with the veterinary department, over 15,000 pigs died because of the disease in 9 affected districts which were Golaghat, Majuli, Dibrugarh, Kamrup, Dhemaji, Biswanath, North Lakhimpur, Sibsagar and Jorhat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/explained-african-swine-fever-suspected-after-over-80-pigs-die-in-mizoram-101617602884917.html

Also, the drug reduced the duration for supplemental oxygen to 56 hours from 84 hours in moderate Covid-19 patients.“…the interim results indicate that PegIFN, when administered early on, could help patients recover faster avoiding much of the complications seen in the advanced stages of the disease. PegIFN in Covid-19 has several add-on advantages compared to other anti-viral agents. The treatment regimen would be less cumbersome and more affordable for patients as Pegylated Interferon Alpha 2b, is a single dose regimen. It would also ensure better compliance,” said the company in a statement.The drug— PegIFN— has well-established safety with multiple doses in chronic hepatitis B and C patients over the years.Aging reduces the body’s ability to produce Interferon Alpha in response to viral infections and may be associated with higher mortality in elderly patients. If given early during infection, the drug can replace this deficiency and aid a faster recovery process.Also Read | India becomes second country after US to record over 100,000 daily Covid casesPatients on Pegylated Interferon Alpha 2b during the trial also showed lesser need for supplemental oxygen, indicating that it was able to control respiratory distress and failure that has been one of the major challenges in treating Covid-19.“The findings are in line with recently reported importance of early IFN treatment given in combination with steroids in the treatment of Covid-19 (Lu et al, Signal Transduction and Targeted Therapy (2021) 6:107, a Nature publication. With these positive results, the company has applied for an approval for additional indication with the DCGI for the use of PegIFN in the treatment of Covid-19,” said the company.The Phase 3 trials were conducted on 250 patients across 20-25 centres in India, and the company is in the process of publishing detailed results of the trials in a peer-reviewed scientific journal.“We are encouraged by the results of Phase 3 study of Pegylated Interferon alpha 2b which has confirmed the potential to reduce virus titres when given earlier in the disease. With Indian Innovation at the forefront helping the country fight the pandemic with diagnostics, vaccines and therapeutics, this marks an important milestone.

While the sky remained overcast in several parts of Kashmir since evening, it started raining at midnight.“A fresh western disturbance, bringing winds from the Mediterranean, will cause light rain and thunder on April 4 and 5 and moderate rain and snow accompanied by thunderstorms and gusty winds on April 6 and 7,” the forecast said.“The system is likely to cause heavy rainfall and snowfall, primarily in the upper reaches of Kashmir such as Gulmarg, Sonamarg, Baramulla, Bandipora, Kupwara , Shopian, Qazigund-Banihal axis, in the Pir Panjal range in Jammu division, and in Dras and Zanskar subdivisions of Ladakh,” meteorologist MH Mir said in a weather advisory to the divisional commissioners of J&K and Ladakh.The fresh precipitation may lead to temporary disruption of surface traffic mainly on the Jammu-Srinagar and Srinagar-Leh national highways, Leh-Manali highway, Mughal Road and Sadhna Pass on April 6 and 7.

05-04-2021||India||Central employment scheme figures fudged in Odisha, says CAG, seeks probe||Odisha has been faulted by the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) for failing to achieve targeted employment of youth and for inflated expenditure under the Deen Dayal Upadhyay Grameen Kaushal Yojana (DDUGKY), run by the ministry of rural development. CAG also underlined massive irregularities in implementation of the scheme, for which the state was earlier adjudged top achiever for two consecutive years.The DDUGKY was started by the Centre in September 2014 for imparting skills to rural youth between the ages of 15 and 35 years and giving them regular jobs and was tied into the National Rural Livelihoods Mission programme. Of the 6.28 lakh rural youths who were employed till December last year, Odisha claimed to have placed the highest number of youth--1,33,853, followed by Andhra Pradesh (67,128) and Jammu and Kashmir (60,433), according to data available on the DDUGKY website.The CAG audited the scheme for the period between 2014 and 2019 and found that 14% training and 77% placements claimed by Odisha Rural Development and Marketing Society (ORMAS), the implementing agency of the scheme, were false and fabricated. ORMAS engaged 95 Project Implementing Agencies (PIAs), mostly private, to provide training in placement-linked skill development courses, but the CAG audit found that many of these agencies were unfit while several of them exaggerated the employment figures.ORMAS received ₹657.90 crore during 2014-19 under DDUGKY and spent ₹568.43 crore as of March 2019 for its target of training 2.02 lakh rural youth. It claimed to have trained 1.31 lakh youth by March 2019 and placed 97,198 of these in jobs.But the CAG audit team found that ORMAS provided undue favour to project implementing agencies by skipping the laid-down appraisal process, a crucial internal control mechanism. The PIAs were selected again and again despite a poor record of placing youth.The audit also found that many of the PIAs, though financially ineligible, were awarded projects in violation of the laid-down procedures due to the intervention of executive director of ORMAS and secretary of panchayati raj department. Four PIAs were sanctioned five projects worth ₹102.13 crore during September 2016 to September 2018 while they were only eligible for projects worth ₹25.20 crore.“The PIAs were selected arbitrarily without conducting mandatory qualitative assessment in terms of their financial strength, commitment to captive placement, parent company structure and core sector presence, etc., which amounted to extension of undue pecuniary benefits to certain PIAs. The PIAs misused the provisions in the DDUGKY reporting system that allowed them to revise MIS figures at their level,” the CAG audit found.One PIA was supposed to provide overseas placements and set up a centre of excellence in Odisha. It continued to get the projects despite failing in both stated objectives. Two PIAs who claimed to have earlier provided placement to 916 and 257 candidates, respectively later revised the figures to 619 and 234 candidates respectively.Claims by PIAs of having provided jobs to the youths also turned out to be exaggerated. CAG audit found that bank statements of several youths did not show any entry, forget salary credit. At least six bank accounts were found to be non-existent and no transactions were seen in 33 accounts. Some of the PIAs even faked ESIC numbers and salary slips of 19 candidates, who they claimed to have provided jobs.The CAG recommended a thorough investigation of all the placement claims. “Ensure that after the verification is conducted, placement percentage is recalculated and any excess money released is recovered with penal interest,” the CAG advised.The CAG report on DDUGKY has come at a time when the state government is under fire from opposition over lack of employment for youths. Recently, leader of opposition Pradipta Naik alleged Odisha has more than 9 lakh registered unemployed youths while thousands of people migrate to other states in search of jobs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/central-employment-scheme-figures-fudged-in-odisha-says-cag-seeks-probe-101617597073700.html

05-04-2021||India||Maoist ambush: Baghel was campaigning in Assam after jawans died, says BJP||Senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader and former Chhattisgarh chief minister Raman Singh hit out at chief minister Bhupesh Baghel on Sunday alleging he was busy campaigning for the Congress in Assam despite the death of 22 security personnel in a Maoist ambush back home on Saturday. Baghel returned from Assam on Sunday evening.“He is holding rallies there (in Assam), taking out marches ...dancing there ...after such a big incident ...elections have become the chief minister’s first priority..,” Raman Singh said.22 police and paramilitary personnel were killed and at least two dozen others were injured in Bastar region as the extremists led by their commander Madvi Hidma ambushed the forces after possibly luring them to a stronghold area near the Bijapur-Sukma border during a combing operation. Deaths of five security personnel were confirmed on Saturday, while 18 more bodies were found on Sunday. One jawan was missing after the attack. This was the worst Maoist attack in the last 4 years.Eight of the deceased were from district reserve guard, six were CoBRA commandos, six others were special task force (STF) members, and one jawan was from the Bastariya battalion of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF). The police suspect about a dozen Maoists were likely killed in the encounter. While CM Bhupesh Baghel ruled out any intelligence failure, Union home minister Amit Shah said that a befitting reply will be given to Maoists at the right time.“The entire state is mourning the death of our jawans but the chief minister is enjoying the festival in Assam. What can be more unfortunate than the fact that Bhupesh Baghel is still busy in Assam electioneering despite such a major incident,” said Dharamlal Kaushik, the leader of opposition in the state assembly.Kaushik said responsibility must be fixed for the operation which went wrong despite the “input of presence of a large number of Maoists”.In response, the Congress accused the BJP of politicising the martyrdom of slain jawans.“Raman Singh should first answer what Amit Shah was doing? Was he campaigning in Assam or not? There is no need to politicize Maoist violence. We all know that Maoists are a national problem and both the state and Central governments are working on it,” said Shailesh Nitin Trivedi, spokesperson of the Congress.Trivedi further alleged that all major attacks in Bastar region took place during the BJP’s rule and the party had no right to sermonise others.“During the BJP rule of 15 years (2003-2018), the state witnessed some of the biggest attacks. The Bhupesh Baghel government has been using the three-pronged strategy of trust, development and security in Maoist-affected areas, and it has resulted in the weakening of Maoists,” said Trivedi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maoist-ambush-bjp-says-baghel-was-campaigning-in-assam-after-jawans-died-101617591014586.html

All you need to know||With the completion of its majestic arches on Monday, the construction of the iconic Chenab Arch Bridge, which will soar 359 metres above the bed of the river and 30 metres higher than the Eiffel Tower in Paris, will reach another milestone. The bridge will provide the much-needed all-weather connectivity between Kashmir and the rest of the county. The bottom ends of the main arch have already been connected, after which the upper arch will now be completed and the two will now be closed. The next step would be the laying of the tracks.Read more: Rail Ministry posts clip about Chenab bridge construction reaching a milestoneHere’s everything you need to know about the Chenab Arch Bridge:1. The bridge is part of an ambitious 272-km rail link project and is being constructed by the Northern Railway at an estimated cost of ₹28,000 crore.2. The bridge will be able to withstand earthquakes with a magnitude of up to eight and high-intensity blasts.3. The bridge, which will include a 14-metre dual carriageway and a 1.2-metre-wide central verge, will have a design speed of around 100 kilometres per hour with a lifespan of 120 years.4. Steel was specifically chosen for the construction of the bridge as it will make the project more economical. The metal will also be able to resist temperatures of minus 20 degree Celsius and wind speeds of above 200 kilometre per hour.5. The preparations of the rail link began in 2002 and the initial plan was to connect Kashmir’s northernmost city Baramulla to New Delhi. The project was given high priority by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led Atal Bihari Vajpayee government but the project suffered several delays owing to the weather conditions and contractual issues, according to officials.6. Work on the bridge started again in July 2017 with the aim of completing the construction by the end of 2019 but due to contractual issues in 2018, it was delayed. The coronavirus pandemic also added to the delay in the construction of the project and the revised guideline for the completion of the project has now been for December 2021.(with agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chenab-arch-bridge-set-to-be-world-s-highest-rail-bridge-all-you-need-to-know-101617586363601.html

However, with the discovery of 18 more bodies on Sunday, the death toll climbed to 22, making it the worst such incident in four years. One jawan was missing after the attack.The police said that out of the 22 jawans killed in the attack, eight were from district reserve guard, six CoBRA commandos, six special task force (STF) members, and one jawan of the “Bastariya” battalion of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF).The gunfight also resulted in the death of a suspected Maoist, the police said, adding that about a dozen others were likely killed in the encounter.Inspector general of police, Bastar range, Sunderaj P said 18 jawans were missing after five security personnel were killed and 31 others injured on Saturday in the gunfight. “On Sunday, bodies of 17 missing personnel were recovered during a search operation. With this, a total 22 personnel have been killed in the incident,” he said.A police officer aware of the developments said it was a “U-shaped attack” in which the security personnel were trapped at a lower level and the Maoists fired indiscriminately from two hilltops in Bijapur, about 400km from the state capital, Raipur. The officer said on condition of anonymity that the Maoist operation was led by Hidma, who was waiting for the forces to enter Terrem jungles. There was intelligence input that Hidma was present in the area for the last 17 days, the officer added.On Friday night, about 1,700 security personnel from different camps in Bijapur and Sukma districts began one of the biggest recent combing operations to look for Hidma. On Saturday, a team of about 450 security personnel was in Jeeram Jonaguda and Tekulguda villages at about 11.45am, when it was ambushed. The security personnel were returning to their camp, the police officer quoted above said.Another senior police officer said that the forces were trapped in the “killing area” of the Maoists in the two villages, which were already vacated by the ultras before the ambush. About 350 Maoists fired at the security forces from the two hillocks and later chased the jawans as they ran to take cover inside huts. The encounter went on for almost three hours, the officer said.The combing operation was launched based on the intelligence inputs about the presence of Maoists belonging to the PLGA (Peoples’ Liberation Guerilla Army) battalion number 1, which is led by Hidma. The second officer did not rule out that it was a false input meant to trap the forces.Director general of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), Kuldiep Singh, who is in Chhattisgarh to monitor the situation following the Maoist attack, however, said there was no intelligence or operational failure.“There is no point in saying that there was some kind of intelligence or operational failure. Had it been some intelligence failure, forces would have not gone for the operation. And if there was some operational failure, so many Naxals would have not been killed,” the CRPF DG told ANI.Prime Minister Narendra Modi condemned the incident and Union home minister Amit Shah and Chhattisgarh chief minister Bhupesh Baghel, who were campaigning for elections in Assam, cut their visits short to review the situation. Shah spoke to Baghel over the incident and said a “befitting response” will be given to the attackers, people aware of the developments said.“My thoughts are with the families of those martyred while fighting Maoists in Chhattisgarh. The sacrifices of the brave martyrs will never be forgotten. May the injured recover at the earliest,” Modi tweeted.Shah said: “Both sides have suffered losses. Our jawans have lost their lives. I pay tributes to them. I want to assure their families that their sacrifice will not go in vain.”Defence minister Rajnath Singh, too, paid tributes to the security personnel. “They fought with utmost courage; their sacrifice will never be forgotten. My deepest condolences to their families,” he said.Congress leader Rahul Gandhi appealed to the state government to help locate the missing soldiers and ensure speedy recoveries for those injured. “My condolences to the families of the martyrs who sacrificed their lives in combat in Chhattisgarh. Decisive action needs to be taken to locate and rescue the missing Jawans. I appeal to the state govt to ensure best care for a speedy recovery of the injured,” he tweeted.Of the injured, seven people were admitted to hospitals in Raipur, while 24 were undergoing treatment at the Bijapur district hospital.Chhattisgarh police’s additional director general Ashok Juneja told AFP that a search operation was on till Sunday evening, and the exact figure of deaths and casualties would be known after the operation was over. Another officer said the death toll was likely to rise in the attack.Juneja said the Maoists looted weapons, ammunition, uniforms and shoes from the security forces who were killed. A senior official told PTI that the Maoists used light machine guns and low-intensity improvised explosive devices to mount the attack.The toll was the worst for security forces battling Maoists since 2017, when 25 jawans were killed in an attack. Seventeen personnel from a commando patrol were killed in an attack by more than 300 armed Maoists in Chhattisgarh in March last year.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/22-jawans-killed-in-ambush-in-chhattisgarh-s-bastar-101617563027094.html

They tried to encircle CoBRA, black panthers and DRG-STF troops but were not successful. We will retaliate on our own terms,” said a senior CRPF official who asked not to be named.The Maoists regrouped and tried to surround another area on Sunday morning after the initial attack, but the attempt was repelled, and security forces reached their base safely, the CRPF official said.The casualty numbers in the ambush on both sides were high as the encounter took place in the nerve centre of the Maoist operations, the Bijapur-Sukma area in the Bastar region, another official said.The official added that the Maoists used barrel grenade launchers in the attack, which resulted in several deaths, many due to splinter injuries. The security forces also retaliated with grenade launchers attached to automatic weapons, the official said.Wireless intercepts indicated that the Maoists managed to track the movement of the security forces, but the Heron drone also picked up movements of multiple Maoist teams, a fourth person said a review of the incident indicated.Around 11.10am on Saturday, a firefight broke out between the forces and the Maoists, with grenade launchers being used by both sides, the person added. The team of the security forces, about 460 of them, later moved towards an open area to facilitate the evacuation of the injured. The troops retrieved the body of a woman from the Maoist group along with an INSAS rifle in an operation later.Also Read | After Maoist attack in Chhattisgarh's Sukma, Amit Shah vows befitting replyUnion home minister Amit Shah on Sunday held a top-level meeting with senior officers in New Delhi on the incident. Home secretary Ajay Bhalla, intelligence bureau director Arvind Kumar and senior CRPF officers were present at the meeting.While CRPF director-general Kuldiep Singh was in Raipur, the home ministry’s adviser on Maoist activities, K Vijay Kumar, was in Jagdalpur to review the situation.Shah, who is scheduled to chair another meeting on the incident on Monday, said a befitting response will be given to those responsible for the Maoist attack.“Our securitymen have lost their lives, we will not tolerate this bloodshed and a befitting reply will be given at an appropriate time,” Shah said. He added that both sides suffered losses and the exact casualty figures were being ascertained.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/up-to-20-maoists-killed-in-gunbattle-officials-101617577770857.html
05-04-2021||India||Ambulance used to ferry Ansari to Mohali found abandoned in Rupnagar: Police||An ambulance used to ferry gangster-turned-politician Mukhtar Ansari to a Mohali court was found abandoned outside a roadside eatery on the Chandigarh-Nangal highway in Punjab's Rupnagar district, police said on Sunday.The police said they have taken the vehicle in their custody."We have taken the ambulance in our custody," Rupnagar Deputy Superintendent of Police T S Gill said over the phone.The police said they got information that the ambulance bearing a registration number of Uttar Pradesh was lying abandoned on the roadside.Ansari, the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) MLA from Mau who is wanted in Uttar Pradesh for various cases, was ferried in the ambulance from the Rupnagar jail to a Mohali court in connection with a 2019 case of extortion.Amid tight security arrangements, Ansari was taken to the court on a wheelchair. He was sent back to the Rupnagar jail, where he is lodged since January 2019, in the ambulance after the court appearance.A case was registered in Uttar Pradesh's Barabanki after the documents of the ambulance were found to be fake, the Uttar Pradesh police had said.The FIR was registered under the relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), including 420 (forgery), 471 (fraudulently or dishonestly using documents as genuine), 467 (forgery of valuable security) and 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating).Amid a row over the issue, a Punjab police official had clarified that an inmate can be transported in a private ambulance on medical grounds and the cost of conveyance has to be borne by the prisoner.According to the Punjab Prisoners (Attendance in Court) Rules, 1969, police can allow a private vehicle on the request of a prisoner, the official had said.The Supreme Court recently directed the Punjab government to hand over the custody of Ansari to the Uttar Pradesh police, saying it was being denied on trivial grounds under the guise of medical issues.The apex court had also said a convict or an undertrial prisoner, who disobeys the law of the land, cannot oppose his transfer from one prison to another and the courts are not to be helpless bystanders when the rule of law is being challenged with impunity.The court had said Ansari's custody be handed over to the Uttar Pradesh police within two weeks so as to lodge him in the Banda district jail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ambulance-used-to-ferry-ansari-to-mohali-found-abandoned-in-rupnagar-police-101617577269664.html

The embassy has not yet put out Kerry’s schedule.“As one of the world’s largest economies, and a global leader in science and innovation, India is a critical part of the solution to the climate crisis. We see India as an important partner on future clean energy research, development, and deployment, not least because of their successful domestic agenda in this area. A key focus for our Administration is supporting and encouraging India’s decarbonisation efforts through clean, zero, and low-carbon investment, and supporting India in mitigating its fossil energy use,” the spokesperson said on Sunday.Officials in the Union environment ministry said there is a diplomatic push to announce a target of achieving net zero emissions by the mid-century, like 58 other countries have announced.India is the third-largest global emitter of carbon dioxide, after China and the US, despite extremely low per capita CO2 emissions, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). India emits 7.1% of global emissions and its per capita emissions are 60% lower than the global average. It is also among a handful of countries whose nationally determined contributions (NDCs) are compatible with keeping global warming under 2 degrees Celsius, as specified in the 2015 Paris Agreement. Only five other countries—Bhutan, Costa Rica, Ethiopia, Kenya and Philippines—are 2°C compatible.India is also on track to overachieve its NDCs. Emission intensity of India’s GDP has reduced by 24% between 2005 and 2016. Its commitment was to reduce emission intensity of GDP by 20-25% from 2005 levels by 2020. India is implementing one of the largest renewable energy expansion programmes with a target of achieving 175GW of renewable energy capacity by 2022, and later up to 450GW, according to a report submitted in February to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).The report, however, said that coal will remain essential for India’s developmental needs and energy security.Experts said India will have to do a careful balancing act. For example, former climate negotiator and ambassador, Chandrashekhar Dasgupta, said in an interview to HT that achieving net zero emissions by the 2050s would be a challenge. “First, it would require us to immediately scrap all existing coal-based power plants and factories, or alternatively, retrofit them with carbon capture and storage technology. This would entail astronomical costs at a time when the economy is already reeling from the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. Second, it would hit our ‘Aatmanirbhar Bharat’ (self-reliance) policy. It would necessitate an immediate switchover to imported, existing clean energy technologies at huge cost, denying our own industry the time required for indigenisation or development of affordable indigenous technologies... Third, we need to examine the trade-related implications of surrendering our principled position on common and differentiated responsibilities (CBDR).” He recommended that India should not bind itself to a global date on achieving net zero emissions.CBDR, a principle under the Paris Agreement, requires richer countries to take historical responsibility for emissions caused in the past by them.Responding to a query on whether India has a policy on net zero emissions, a senior environment ministry official last week said: “The world will be better placed to declare any new targets when global stocktaking process concludes in 2023.”Meanwhile, the Climate Action Tracker (CAT) said on March 11 that if the Biden administration wants the US to be consistent with the target of keeping global warming under 1.5°C, its new 2030 Paris Agreement target should aim for emission reductions of at least 57%-63% below 2005 levels.The US’s action on climate change is presently “critically insufficient”, according to CAT."A net-zero target is not a trivial endeavour for any country—especially for a lower-middle income country like India that has the dual challenge of providing modern energy services to millions while protecting the environment. We will need a number of technologies to become better and cheaper—energy storage, faster EV charging, fuel cells, hydrogen electrolysers, agricultural technologies, carbon capture, and direct air capture - which will be absolutely crucial to achieve any net zero target. Public and private partnerships with the US can play a very important role in technological innovation and adaptation to India's needs. The quest for a net-zero emissions future could bring new jobs and better health for Indians. But much depends on infusion of international capital and disruptive technologies,” said Ulka Kelkar, director, climate at World Resources Institute.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/on-india-visit-kerry-to-push-for-cutting-fossil-fuel-imprint-101617573330831.html
05-04-2021||India||WWII veteran on new mission to motivate others to get vaccinated||Ninety-five-year-old World War II veteran Ramlal Sabharwal is on a special mission — that of motivating others to get vaccinated against Covid-19. The retired army subedar received his first dose of the coronavirus (Covid-19) vaccine on March 16.“I fought in the World War II, the Sino-Indian War, and the India-Pakistan War. I know that even 10% protective shield is enough to increase the survival rate. Here, vaccines are 80% effective,” Sabharwal said.The Indore resident said that the Covid-19 pandemic is one of the longest battles faced by the world, after the two World Wars.“When people ask me about the side effects [of the vaccine], I tell them that in a war even a small stone is enough to save from bullets, the vaccination is like a bulletproof jacket,” said Sabharwal, who suffers from a heart ailment.Sabharwal received his first dose at Apollo Hospital in Indore. He was administered the Covishield vaccine, manufactured by Pune-based Serum Institute of India. “I have seen many tough times — wars, Emergency, communal riots. We always adopted an attacking strategy with weapons to destroy the enemy as we were aware of the power of the enemy. But this time enemy is a small virus and its mutants. We have only one strategy — to fight defensively and the vaccine is the only defensive shield we have,” he said.When the pandemic struck last year, Sabharwal and his family of six devised a protocol of their own to avoid getting infected.“I live with my son, daughter-in-law, grandson, granddaughter-in-law and two great-grandsons, one of whom is a “coronial” baby (born during the pandemic). They used to keep a distance of six feet after coming from outside. They are still extra cautious and come to my room only after taking a bath and sanitising everything,” he said.Sabharwal believes that the government has done a good job in containing the spread of the disease.“When the pandemic broke early in 2020, the whole world was ill-prepared for the situation. There were crises of masks and PPE kits, most important things to save themselves from virus, but we fought bravely…”Now, we have enough masks, PPE kits, and the most important thing, which is vaccines, he said.His son and daughter-in-law, both aged over 60, have also received the first dose of the vaccine. India opened up its vaccination drive to all people above 45 last week. The previous two phases of the drive – the first was aimed at health care and frontline workers and the second at those above 60 and or above 45 with comorbidities – were dogged by a slow roll-out, teething problems, vaccine hesitancy, and misinformation.So far, nearly 2.1 million people have been vaccinated in Madhya Pradesh, said state immunisation officer Santosh Shukla. Of these, 776,112 frontline and health care workers have received the first dose, while 500,917 have received the second dose.MP medical education minister Vishwas Sarang said: “We are happy that people are taking interest and coming out for vaccination. But at the same time, many people are not coming out as they believed the lie which is being spread by some antisocial elements.” “After this second wave of Covid 19, we are hoping that people will understand the seriousness and will come out for vaccination,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/wwii-veteran-on-new-mission-to-motivate-others-to-get-vaccinated-101617569283185.html
05-04-2021||India||Poor quality of legal education worrying, says justice Ramana||Chief Justice of India (CJI)-designate NV Ramana said on Sunday that poor quality of legal education, along with other issues, was to be blamed for staggering pendency of cases across courts in the country.“There are many substandard colleges in the country, which is a very worrying trend... One of the consequences of the poor quality of legal education in the country is the exploding pendency in the country. There are nearly 3.8 crore cases pending in all the courts in India despite the large number of advocates in the country,” said justice Ramana, as he addressed the convocation ceremony of Andhra Pradesh-based Damodaram Sanjivayya National Law University.According to the National Judicial Data Grid (NJDG), the total number of pending cases in the subordinate judiciary (courts below the level of the high court) was 37.2 million at the end of January 2021. More than 4 million cases were pending in high courts at that time. As on March 1 this year, the Supreme Court had over 66,000 pending cases.The issue was also flagged by government think-tank Niti Aayog. In its 2018 strategy paper, titled “New India @75”, the body underscored that at the current rate of disposal of cases by courts, it would take more than 324 years to clear the backlog. The total number of cases pending at the time was 29 million.Delivering his address virtually, justice Ramana pointed out that although around 150,000 students graduate from law colleges every year, but less than 25% of them are actually ready for the profession.“This is in no way a comment on the graduates themselves, who certainly possess the required attributes to be successful lawyers. Rather, it is a comment on the large number of substandard legal educational institutions in the country, which are colleges merely in name,” he said, adding that the judiciary was also making efforts to improve the situation.Justice Ramana said that legal graduates should be made to understand from the very beginning about the true duty of a lawyer, which was to unite people. He also said they should get practical experience through association with lok adalats, legal aid centres, and arbitration and mediation centres during their studies.“Lawyers can play an important role in reducing the pendency by advising their clients to settle their disputes at the pre-litigation stage itself. They should also give proper advice to their clients as to how to pursue their legal claims without abusing the process. They must keep in mind not only their duty to their clients, but also their duty to the courts, to society and to the law,” he emphasised.Imploring graduates to act as “the conscience bearers of the nation”, justice Ramana said that they had a duty to render voice to the voiceless and make contributions to society.He also lamented that the education system was currently not equipped to build the character of the students, or to develop social consciousness and responsibility.“Students are often caught in the rat race. All of us should therefore make a collective effort to revamp the educational system to ensure that students can have the right outlook to their career and life outside,” said justice Ramana.On March 24, Chief Justice of India SA Bobde designated the second most senior judge, justice Ramana, as his successor. Justice Bobde retires on April 23 and justice Ramana will become the 48th CJI the next day. He will serve till August 26, 2022.Manan Kumar Mishra, senior advocate and Bar Council of India chairman, told HT: “The BCI is taking all possible steps and we now have an advisory committee to prescribe standards of legal education. This committee, incidentally, is headed by justice Ramana.”Mishra added that BCI has also imposed a three-year moratorium in August 2019 for opening of new law colleges as a measure to stop mushrooming of institutions without adequate infrastructure and proper academics.“You must have good law teachers too if you want good lawyers. Be it affiliation of law colleges or having competent teachers, universities have the first and foremost responsibility. BCI’s role is limited to giving approvals once universities grant affiliation. But we are still taking utmost steps to ensure improvement of quality of legal education,” said Mishra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/poor-quality-of-legal-education-worrying-says-justice-ramana-101617564381469.html
05-04-2021||India||Fuel prices may fall further, says oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan||State-run oil marketing companies have recently cut petrol, diesel and cooking gas rates, and fuel prices may fall further in the near future, Union petroleum minister Dharmendra Pradhan on Sunday said in Kolkata ahead of the third-phase polling for the assembly elections in West Bengal.Fuel prices were frozen since February 27 immediately after the Election Commission (EC) announced assembly elections in five states. But public sector retailers have reduced petrol and diesel rates in three small doses -- by 61 paise per litre and 60 paise a litre, respectively -- since March 24. State-run companies cut cooking gas price by ₹10 a cylinder last Thursday.“In last few days, petrol and diesel rates have started falling. We had said earlier that when crude oil prices will fall in the international market, we will pass on the benefit to the consumer... Price of LPG (liquefied petroleum gas or cooking gas) has also started falling. It will fall further in coming days,” Pradhan told reporters.Politically sensitive fuel prices will fall further in coming days, a senior government official with direct knowledge of the matter said on Sunday, requesting anonymity. The cut in diesel prices are expected to be steeper compared to petrol, the official said. HT reported on April 1 that a fall in fuel rates was imminent.According to state-run Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), the country’s largest fuel refiner and retailer, prices of crude oil and petroleum product in the international market softened in the second fortnight of March due to growing worries about rising Covid-19 cases in Europe and Asia, and some concerns over side effects of vaccines.“We are hoping international prices would remain stable and would not go up so that the benefit can be passed on to the consumer,” petroleum secretary Tarun Kapoor was quoted as saying in an HT report last week as prices of crude and petroleum products softened from a peak of nearly $70 a barrel.Brent crude, which was below $60 a barrel until February 5, 2021, saw a strong rally for over a month to peak at $69.63 per barrel on March 11 because of supply squeeze by the oil producers’ cartel, the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, including Russia (together known as OPEC+). Its latest rate, before the weekend’s close, was around $64 a barrel.The cartel resorted to cut about one-tenth of global output in April 2020 after Brent crude plunged below $20 per barrel due to weak demand because of lockdowns in global economies. Also, Saudi Arabia cut additional output by 1 million barrels per day since February this year. The cartel is reluctant to raise output matching the spurt in demand.An official working with a state-run refiner said on condition of anonymity that public sector oil marketing companies (OMCs) will be asked to absorb some price volatility to keep petrol, diesel and cooking gas prices stable since the firms have made decent profits this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fuel-prices-may-fall-further-says-oil-minister-dharmendra-pradhan-101617563906163.html

Sodhi was among the 22 security personnel killed in the attack in which around 31 others sustained injuries.“We were five brothers and out of that four are serving as policemen -- fighting against Maoists. We are saddened and mourning the loss of my brother but we are not afraid...The locals and villagers are very angry after the attack as many young tribals from the village have joined the security forces in last few years,” Bheema said. The brothers hailed from Kunnur village in Bijapur district.Narayan is survived by his wife and four children.On Saturday, five security personnel were said to have been killed shortly after about 1,700 men launched a combing operation for Maoist commander Madvi Hidma. However, with the discovery of 17 more bodies on Sunday, the death toll climbed to 22, making it the worst such incident in four years. One jawan was missing after the attack.The police said that out of the 22 jawans killed in the attack, eight were from district reserve guard, six CoBRA commandos, six special task force (STF) members, and one jawan of the “Bastariya” battalion of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF).A soldier from the CRPF’s newly formed Bastariya Battalion, Somiaya Mandavi, was also killed in the ambush. Mandavi, a native of Awaapalli village, joined the CRPF five years ago. “He got married three years ago and had a 10-month-old son. Somiaya recently built a house and was planning a house warming party after his return,” said his brother Shankar Mandavi.“After joining the force, he changed the fortune of our family. We don’t know what would happen to us now,” he said.Residents of Assam, Uttar Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, and Andhra Pradesh were also among the security personnel killed in the attack. Chief ministers of several states including UP’s Yogi Adityanath and Assam’s Sarbanda Sonowal mourned the deaths of the soldiers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/we-are-saddened-but-not-afraid-say-families-of-slain-jawans-101617563591467.html
05-04-2021||India||Daily cases may double in 15 days if norms flouted: Expert||The daily cases in Bengaluru are likely to double by April 20 if people continue to neglect maintaining social distancing and do not adhere to Covid-19 protocols , a member of the expert panel constituted by the state government said on Sunday. Girdhara R Babu, epidemiologist and professor at the Public Health Foundation of India (PHFI) and a member of Karnataka’s technical advisory committee (TAC) on Covid-19 said that most of the congregations are preventable and measures that could have been taken at a local level is fast evolving and necessitating national level mitigation. “At this rate, #Bengaluru will have about 6,500 daily cases by April 20. Even if 10% of them require hospitalisation, the health system will run out of capacity in (a) few days. We need action now, not tomorrow. Stay home people, wear masks if going out and get (a) vaccine when eligible,” Babu said in a Twitter post on Sunday. Bengaluru reported 2,787 new infections in the 24 hours on Saturday that takes its active case count to 28,098. The active case count in Karnataka approached the 40,000 mark as 4,553 more infections were reported across the state. Babu said that this was a “conservative estimate” and not a pessimistic approach. He said that even if 10% of those testing positive each day require hospitalisation, the system will collapse. The predictions come at a time when Bengaluru and several other districts of Karnataka have seen a sharp spike in cases, indicating that the second wave of infections were spreading faster than what was seen the first time around since last March. “While the lockdown in 2020 was mostly unavoidable, the impending one in 2021 is mostly preventable,” Babu added.The area of concern remains the rapidly surging positivity rate in the state. In the 24 hours on Saturday, the positivity rate remained at 3.79% and 331 persons were in the intensive care units of various hospitals in the state including 158 in Bengaluru alone. Mysuru, about 125 kms from Bengaluru reported 260 new cases while the situation in Bidar, Kalaburagi, Tumakuru, Bengaluru Rural, Hassan and Dharwad among other places also deteriorated steadily, shows official data. There were 93 new infections in Ballari, 147 in Bidar, 155 in Bengaluru Rural, 83 in Dakshina Kannada, 100 in Dharwad, 104 in Hassan, 170 in Kalaburagi and 107 in Tumakuru, data shows. The state government is hoping that the vaccination will help contain the spread of the virus. However, Babu said that the vaccination can prevent Covid-19 from turning serious or fatal but does not provide immunity from the virus. Those who have got both doses of the virus should continue to wear masks as they are not immune from the virus and can spread it further, he added The Karnataka government has so far vaccinated 4,355,893 persons in all categories that include both the first and second doses.In a brief statement on Sunday, the Chief Minister’s Office (CMO) said that on request from Karnataka, the government of India is making an emergency supply of 15.25 lakh doses to the state. The statement added that the state has 7 lakh vaccines and that the state inoculated 2.5 lakh people in one day on Saturday. “Karnataka will receive 15,25,500 doses of Covid-19 vaccine tomorrow in two consignments. One consignment of 5,25,500 doses will arrive at Belagavi by road and another consignment of 10,00,000 doses will arrive at Bengaluru by air through a late evening flight,” K Sudhakar, Karnataka’s health, family welfare and medical education minister said on Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/daily-cases-may-double-in-15-days-if-norms-floutedexpert-101617563531571.html
05-04-2021||India||BJP releases clip to mount attack on Abhishek over coal case||Kolkata: The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Sunday released an audio clip claiming that Trinamool Congress youth wing president and chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s nephew Abhishek Banerjee received ₹900 crore from corruption.BJP leader Suvendu Adhikari, who contested against the CM on the East Midnapore district’s Nandigram assembly seat on April 1, released the audio clip at a press conference and claimed that Abhishek Banerjee received ₹900 crore from rackets that smuggled cow, coal and sand. The purported audio clip, he said, allegedly contains conversation that took place between Kolkata-based businessman Ganesh Bagaria and the absconding general secretary of the youth wing of the TMC, Vinay Mishra, both of whom are suspects in the coal smuggling scam that the CBI and ED are probing. In the audio clip, the veracity of which was not independently verified by HT, one man could be heard telling the other that money from the coal scam went to Abhishek Banerjee. The BJP released the clip a few hours after the Enforcement Directorate (ED) arrested Ashok Mishra, an inspector of the West Bengal police who was posted in Bankura district in the coal pilferage case. “He has more evidence, which will be released later,” said Adhikari. Dismissing the fresh allegations made on Sunday, Bengal’s deputy parliamentary affairs minister Tapas Roy said, “Why is the BJP making these allegations in the middle of the elections? They brought similar charges in the past as well. It had no effect. This, too, will prove to be a futile attempt.” The CBI and ED officials did not comment on the audio clip on Sunday.In February, the CBI questioned Abhishek Banerjee’s wife Rujira Naroola and her sister Maneka Gambhir, the latter’s husband Ankush Arora and his father Pawan Arora in the coal smuggling case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-releases-clip-to-mount-attack-on-abhishek-over-coal-case-101617563171509.html
05-04-2021||India||Maharashtra steps up restrictions as cases continue to surge||The state of Maharashtra returned to near-lockdown levels of curbs on Sunday with authorities imposing a night and weekend curfew, ordering non-essentials businesses shut, and requiring most offices to switch to remote working as the relentless surge in Covid-19 continued, reinforcing fears that the state could soon see a shortage of hospital beds, doctors and medical oxygen supply.On Sunday, Maharashtra recorded 57,074 – by far the highest number for a single day yet – while the state’s capital became the first Indian city to add new infections in the five digits with over 11,206 new infections. The new infections in the state account for 54% of the cases recorded countrywide, with Maharashtra’s count being close to ten times of the state with the next highest number.According to the government’s “break the chain” order, there will be a complete lockdown on weekends and for 11 hours – from 8pm to 7am – on the other days. People will only be allowed outside for essential services such as to buy groceries or to go to a hospital.Click here for complete Covid-19 coverageAt no point can more than five people gather outdoors, and places of worship, malls, theatres, swimming pools and gyms will be closed. Restaurants and eateries will be allowed to serve only take-out food, the order added.The decisions were taken after chief minister Uddhav Thackeray convened an urgent meeting of council of ministers on Sunday to deliberate on the stricter curbs in the state. The partial lockdown was allowed after the cabinet meeting and the detailed SOP was issued later in the day.Before the cabinet meeting, Thackeray spoke with leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis and Maharashtra Navnirman Sena chief Raj Thackeray, held meetings with key industrialists and producers of TV serials and films.Thackeray, in his address to the people of Maharashtra on Friday, hinted at the stricter curbs by weekend. On Saturday, he said if the choice had to be made between saving lives or saving jobs, it would have to be lives.The surge in cases has resulted in shortage of the beds and oxygen in several cities and districts, forcing the state government to shut industrial units grazing oxygen in large quantities.Now, private offices have been instructed to switch to remote working while government offices are allowed to work at 50% strength. Private offices in essential services, including banking, insurance, pharmaceuticals and those involved in water or power supply, have been allowed to operate as usual.“We are not touching the industrial sector as it directly linked with the financial health of the state. The industrial units, construction sites are allowed to operate, while the shooting of films and TV serials can go on by adhering to the Covid-19 protocol,” Nawab Malik, minority affairs minister, said after the cabinet meeting.The government has not reduced the timings of commuting in the local trains for the general public in Mumbai Metropolitan Region. The state expects the crowding to reduce as private offices, shops, establishments in non essential services are not allowed to operate.Similarly e-commerce sector has been allowed to operate with home delivery allowed between 7am and 8pm. The vaccination of the delivery boys has been made mandatory though the notification is silent how they will be vaccinated if they are below 45 years of age.Housing societies with more than 5 active patients will now be declared as mini containment zones, with no outsiders allowed to visit the premises, the statement issued by publicity department has stated.Leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis supported the decisions. “We are going through a very scary stage of second wave of Covid-19 pandemic. The transmission of the virus is faster and proving fatal leading to rise in the mortality rate. We have appealed BJP workers and leaders to cooperate with the state authorities and actively participate in the vaccination drive. But at the same time, the state government should undertake awareness drive to apprise people with the fatality of the new strain,” he said.State health minister Rajesh Tope said that besides stepping up of the health care infrastructure, the state government is aiming at ramping up the vaccination drive. “After vaccinating 462,000 citizens on Saturday we are now aiming to increase the daily number to more than 6 lakh people per day by increasing vaccination centers and operating them 24X7. Our entire focus will be breaking the chain of transmission. Similarly, districts administrations have also been directed to increase the number of beds. To overcome the shortage of oxygen supply which we have been facing even after reserving 90% of the production for medical purposes, we have decided to shut down the industrial unit gazing oxygen in large quantity,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maha-steps-up-restrictions-as-cases-continue-to-surge-101617562932554.html
05-04-2021||India||U’khand sounds alarm over forest fires, govt sends NDRF||Several new forest fires flared in the hills of Uttarakhand over the weekend, triggering alarm in the state as well as the central government, which has decided to rush teams of the National Disaster Relief Force (NDRF) and deployed helicopters to airdrop water over what at present are 45 blazing clusters of woodlands spread over 68 acres. Unusually dry and warm weather has ignited one of the worst episodes of forest fires in Uttarakhand this year, claiming the lives of four people and numerous animals, in addition to damaging 1,359 hectares of land. Since January 1, 1,028 fires have been recorded with Pauri-Garhwal region hit the hardest.“I have spoken to Uttarakhand chief minister Tirath Singh Rawat to get an update on forest fires in the state. Instructions have been issued to send helicopters and National Disaster Response Force teams to the state to minimise loss of lives and property due to the wildfires,” Shah said in a tweet. The NDRF team was likely to arrive by Monday.Rawat called an emergency meeting of senior officials of the forest and disaster management departments and all district magistrates to assess the situation and discuss ways to effectively control it, state government officials said.The worst affected districts also include Almora, Nainital, Pithoragarh and Tehri. In Nainital, Oak forests, which typically have higher water content than Pine trees and are comparatively resistant to forest fires, are ablaze.Experts said the lack of rains this year has contributed to the problem of wildfires, which typically peak in the month of May. Man Singh, nodal officer for forest fires in the state forest department said that this year, there has been 65 % less rainfall while temperatures have been higher. “We are taking a lot of measures to contain the alarming situation. It seems that 2021 could be a repeat of 2016 when over 4,400 hectares of forest land was damaged in forest fires. We will make all possible efforts to reduce forest fires and seek the help of locals in this regard,” he said. Rohit Thapliyal, scientist at Indian Meteorological Centre, Dehradun, said this year, Uttarakhand reported below normal rainfall. “The rainfall was below normal by around 30% in January, by around 50 % in February and by around 70 % in March. Besides, on many days, the maximum daily temperature was above the normal in the state, creating dry conditions, a cause for forest fires,” he said. With over 71% of its total geographical area under forests, human habitation in Uttarakhand is often adjacent to heavily wooded areas, which increases the chances of forest fire. In Uttarakhand, 0.17% of total forest cover comes under the extremely fire-prone category, while 1.60% is very highly fire-prone, 9.32% highly fire-prone, 21.66% moderately fire-prone and 67.25% under what is known as the less fire-prone category. Wildfires are ignited in several ways: they can either by manmade or sparked by lightning, the friction from falling rocks and even from sparks caused by rocks dislodged by monkeys. Hemant Gauniya, who had filed RTI on forest fires in the state in the past, said despite spending money on fire control, large chunks of forests are hit every year. “Why have we not been able to come out with an effective mechanism to reduce these forest fires that damage so much of our biodiversity over the years”, he asked, questioning the efforts. Typically, a triad of factors is required for wildfires to rage: dry air, high temperature and fuel load. Fuel load refers to combustibles in the forest, which typically are the pine needles that blanket the forest floor this time of the year. Experts believe if one of the factors are removed from the equation, the problem may not be as severe. Since temperature and air can’t be controlled, the best strategy would be to manage the fuel load by removing pine needles, experts have said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ukhand-sounds-alarm-over-forest-fires-govt-sends-ndrf-101617562631506.html
05-04-2021||India||Forces lured into a ‘U-shaped’ attack in Chhattisgarh||Maoists carried out a “U-type” ambush in Chhattisgarh’s Bijapur district after luring security personnel into a trap with the input of the possible presence of a top Maoist commander, officials familiar with the matter said on Sunday.Also Read | Up to 20 Maoists killed in gunbattle: OfficialsThe Maoist operation was led by commander of battalion number-1 Madvi Hidma — forces have been looking for him for years — who gathered at least 300 armed cadres in a fortnight and vacated the three villages that were the site of the gunfight, officials aware of the details of the encounter said, adding that Hidma was trying to lure the forces into the Terrem jungle area for 17 days.“The security personnel were caught unawares and were at a disadvantageous position. The Maoists planned a U-type ambush. At a particular area, there were hills on two sides and when Maoists started firing, the security forces tried to return. The Maoists encircled them,” said one of the officials quoted above.In a “U-shaped ambush”, there is only one escape route which is also the entry point, an official explained. The Jeeragaon village is surrounded with hills on three sides and as soon as the security forces entered the villages, the rebels started firing at them, forcing the security personnel to run further ahead, and thereby getting trapped in a U-shaped encounter, the officer said.Also Read | ‘He recently built a house...’: Kin of soldier who died in Chhattisgarh encounter“Hidma called over 300 armed cadres from different parts of Bastar and they gathered close to the encounter spot,” a police officer said on condition of anonymity.“His plan was to lure security forces but for 15 days the security forces did not reach the area. He was getting desperate because the arrangements of 350 people were costing a lot,” another official said.Director general of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), Kuldiep Singh, who is in Chhattisgarh to monitor the situation following the Maoist attack, however, said there was no intelligence or operational failure.“There is no point in saying that there was some kind of intelligence or operational failure. Had it been some intelligence failure, forces would have not gone for the operation. And if there was some operational failure, so many Naxals would have not been killed,” the CRPF DG told ANI.Following a specific input that Hidma was hiding in the area, the Chhattisgarh police decided to enter the forest as the elimination of the top commander would have been a major setback for the Maoist forces, officials said.On Friday, at around 11pm, nearly 1,700 security personnel from different camps in Bijapur and Sukma districts began a combing operation.The following morning, around 11.45am, a team of about 450 security personnel was returning to their camp through the Jonaguda , Jeeragaon and Tekalgudum villages when it was attacked, the officials said. The three villages were vacated by the Maoists prior to the attack.The Maoists ambushed the forces in the area, which is a stronghold of the rebels due to difficult terrain, large tracts of forests and a smaller number of security forces’ camps.A senior Chhattisgarh police officer, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that the forces “underestimated the efficiency of the Maoists”. “We had information about the Maoist strength but somewhere there was lack of strategic planning. We have also underestimated the efficiency of Maoists. It seems that they had practised everything earlier in the terrains,” the officer said.A local intelligence officer said that the personnel tried to take refuge in the vacant huts in the villages. “But the Maoists tactically targeted the commanders of security forces who were leading the team,” the officer said, asking not to be named.Another senior police officer said: “The reason behind high casualty was that the field commanders of security forces were targeted by Maoists. Bullet injuries to CRPF CoBRA and District Reserve Guard (DRG) field commanders led to disarray in command and control,” said the official.One apparent reason for the attack was the Chhattisgarh police’s plan to set up a security camp in Silger village, near Terrem, another police officer said. The camp would have interrupted the Maoist corridor connecting Bijapur to Sukma and the rebels would have lost control over the core area, the officer said.The attack has come amid the annual tactical counteroffensive campaign, from March to July, during which rebels carry out maximum attacks against security forces and attempt to increase their cadre strength.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/forces-lured-into-a-u-shaped-attack-101617562571434.html
05-04-2021||India||Centre sends NDRF, choppers to douse raging forest fires in Uttarakhand||The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) on Sunday decided to deploy the National Disaster Relief Force (NDRF) and choppers to control Uttarakhand's raging forest fires. Chief minister Tirath Singh Rawat has already directed the forest department to deploy all resources to control the fires which have wreaked havoc in six districts due to continuing dry conditions and hot weather.According to the forest department, since January 1, the state has reported 1,028 forest fire incidents in which 1,359 hectares of forest land has been damaged. Currently, over 45 forest fires are raging in hill districts, which have damaged over 68 acres of forest land in the past 24 hours. The worst-affected districts include Pauri, Almora, Nainital, Pithoragarh and Tehri. In Nainital, even Oak forests, which have high water content and are comparatively resistant to forest fires, have been caught in raging fires.This year till April 4, of 1,028 forest fire incidents, the maximum incidents of fires (254) have been reported in Pauri Garhwal, followed by 94 in Pithoragarh, 94 in Bageshwar, 91 in Nainital, 88 in Tehri, 71 in Uttarkashi and so on, data provided by the state forest department stated. Even plain districts like Haridwar and Uddam Singh (US) Nagar reported forest fires this year. Four people were killed in these fires this year, compared to one last year.The officials said that this year's alarming forest fires are a grim reminder of 2016 when over 4,400 hectares of forests were damaged in fires during the summer months.The official forest fire season starts in February and ends in June with the arrival of the monsoon.Given the alarming forest fire situation, CM Rawat convened an emergency meeting of the senior officials on Sunday through videoconferencing and directed them to reduce the response time to forest fires.Rawat also cancelled the leaves of all forest officials and directed the forest watchers to keep a tab on fire incidents. He directed officials to seek the help of van (forest) panchayats and local people in checking forest fires. He also ordered officials to chalk out a long-term plan to reduce forest fire incidents to a minimum and set up fire control rooms and fire stations at tehsil and block level.Rawat spoke to home minister Amit Shah regarding the situation in the state. Shah told Rawat about the two choppers being sent by the Centre. While one chopper will be stationed at Gochar and draw water from Srinagar, the other one will be stationed at Haldwani and will draw water from Bhimtal lake for dousing the fires.Also Read | 964 locations, 40 active spots: All you need to know about Uttarakhand forest fire“I spoke with Uttarakhand chief minister Tirath Singh Rawat and sought information about the forest fires in the state. The Central government has given orders to deploy NDRF teams and provide helicopters to the Uttarakhand government to control the forest fires,” the home minister tweeted on Sunday.Man Singh, nodal officer for forest fires in the state forest department, said that this year there has been 65% less rainfall which, coupled with a rise in temperatures, led to a spike in forest fires. “We are taking many measures to contain the alarming situation. It seems that 2021 could be a repeat of 2016 when over 4,400 hectares of forest land was damaged in forest fires. We will make all possible efforts to reduce forest fires and seek the help of locals in this regard,” he said.Rohit Thapliyal, scientist at Indian Meteorological Centre Dehradun, said this year Uttarakhand reported below normal rainfall. “The rainfall was below normal by around 30% in January, by around 50% in February and by around 70% in March. Besides, on many days the maximum daily temperature was above normal in the state, creating dry conditions - a cause for forest fires,” he said.Why Uttarakhand reports so many forest firesUttarakhand has a rich forest area of over 38,000 sq km which constitutes 71% of the total geographical area of the state. More area under forests with neighbouring human habitations means more chances of forest fires. Given the diversity of forests in the state, Uttarakhand forests are prone to fires. About 0.17% of the total forest cover of the state comes under the extremely fire-prone category, 1.60% under very highly fire-prone, 9.32% under highly fire-prone, 21.66% under moderately fire-prone and 67.25% under less fire-prone category.Forest fire activity is generally reported from February to June, with a peak in fire incidence in May and June. Three types of forest fires are reported in the state including ground fires, surface fire and crown fires. Besides man-made, other reasons for forest fires in the state include lightning, friction of falling rocks and monkeys accidentally throwing stones that create sparks leading to forest fires.Over the years, many activists, experts and even courts have raised questions over the forests fires in the hill state. Last year, 172 hectares of jungles were affected by forest fires. The forest area affected due to fires in 2019 was 2,981 hectares. The corresponding figure was 4,480 hectares in 2018, 1,228 hectares in 2017, 4,433 hectares in 2016 and 701 hectares in 2015.Hemant Gauniya, who had filed an RTI on forest fires in the state in the past, said despite spending so much money on fire control, large chunks of forests get damaged every year. “Why have we not able to come out with an effective mechanism to reduce these forest fires that damage so much of our biodiversity?” he question.In May 2018, the Uttarakhand High Court, while taking suo moto cognisance of the forest fires in the state, directed the state government to submit the details of the forest fires, the kind of damage caused and what steps the government was taking to prevent them. The state government in its response informed the HC that 90% of the forest fires in the state were “man-made”. The HC remarked, “We were very shocked to hear the reply of the government. How is it possible when people have migrated from thousands of villages, they have a role in 90% of the forest fires in the state”.In June 2019, a public interest litigation (PIL) on forest fires in Uttarakhand, filed in the Supreme Court by a Tehri Garhwal-based advocate, highlighted that forest fires were wiping out entire species of birds, small insects and animals. It said that carbon dioxide emitted from the fires was causing temperature rise in the hills resulting in a faster meltdown of glaciers, besides causing pollution and ecological imbalance.The PIL sought urgent steps to be taken to protect/safeguard the forests, wildlife and birds from the forest fires in Uttarakhand and also ensure the right to a healthy environment.According to forest experts, for forest fire incidents to occur, a fire triangle of air, temperature and fuel load is needed. If even one of the factors from this triangle is removed, then fire cases will automatically drop. As temperature and air can’t be controlled, the best strategy is to manage the fuel load. When the fuel load (pine needles) from the forest floor is removed, cases of forest fires can be reduced.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-sends-ndrf-choppers-to-douse-raging-forest-fires-in-uttarakhand-101617561765179.html
05-04-2021||India||Need to strike a balance while imposing lockdown, says CSIR's Dr Mande||Lockdown helps in containing the spread of coronavirus, but affects the economy adversely and hence there is a need to strike a balance while imposing it, Director-General of the CSIR, Dr Shekhar Mande, said on Sunday.While speaking to reporters virtually, he also said that the L452R mutant of coronavirus that was detected in California in the USA, is causing concern in Maharashtra right now.Dr Mande said there is very little evidence that the vaccine would not work on the virus mutant and added that vaccination reduces the intensity of the disease."Lockdown will help in containing the spread as people stay indoors. Even if the virus spreads, it will only affect the family members and it will not spread outside. If you see the last year's lockdown in India, the spread of the disease was quite slow in the country as compared to other countries, including Italy which witnessed an explosion of Covid-19," he said.But in India, it did not happen because lockdown had been imposed in the country in March, the DG of the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research said."But there are side-effects of the lockdown as it affects the economy adversely which leads to job losses. So, we need to look for the balance while imposing lockdowns. Possibilities need to be seen whether full or partial lockdown can be imposed," he said.His remarks come on the day the Maharashtra government announced a weekend lockdown and a slew of restrictions in the state to curb the spread of the virus.Speaking about mutations of the virus, Dr Mande said, "L452R mutant of the virus detected in California, is causing concern in Maharashtra right now. At this moment, we can only hypothesise and as per the hypothesis. it is possible that some people might have carried this mutant from California to other destinations and that is spreading wildly."He added that as far as sequencing is concerned, a lot of samples have been sequenced from different districts of Maharashtra and many of them actually fell in the category of this L452R mutation and its other combinations are E484Q and E687.Dr Mande said that the Scientific Advisory Group of the Indian SARS CoV 2 Genomics Consortium (INSACOG) has completed more than 10,000 sequences till now."In Maharashtra, National Institute of Virology and National Centre of Cell Science are currently sequencing. To step up sequencing, we are also roping in National Chemical Laboratory in Pune," he said.He said that since it has been revealed that L452R is spreading in Maharashtra rapidly, the government has been asked to keep a close watch on those whose samples had this mutant."If today one person tests positive and it comes to light that the sample of the person has this particular mutant, then it is the responsibility of the authorities to inform the person and get him quarantined," he said."We are keeping a close watch on those who have this particular mutant in their samples," he added.He said that he and others from INSACOGare in constant touch with the Maharashtra government and members of the task force."We have already sent them a format on how to do the sampling (for sequencing) and it has been communicated to all the district administrations that how we have to do the sampling in every district," he added.Speaking about the vaccines and mutations of the virus, Dr Mande added that there is very little evidence that the vaccine would not work on the mutants."There are two divergent views that have emerged in the scientific literature in the last one or two months that some vaccines are less effective on mutants. But these views are challenged by others, who say that the vaccines are equally effective on mutants."So, the debate is on in the scientific world at this stage about the definite benefit of the vaccines that have been found. But one thing is sure that vaccination reduces the intensity of the disease," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/need-to-strike-a-balance-while-imposing-lockdown-says-csir-s-dr-mande-101617560738046.html

05-04-2021||Today's||Will bitcoin follow the mania, panic and crash trajectory?||On March 11, 2020, bitcoin was valued at around $8,000. By the end of December, it had risen nearly four times to touch $29,000. And by mid-March 2021, it had further doubled to $60,000 levels. To understand this surge, let us return to the basics.In October 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto released a research article, Bitcoin: A peer to peer electronic cash system, on the internet. This was after the failure of Lehman Brothers, which, in turn, led to the global financial crisis. The 2008 crisis led to a complete breakdown of trust and raised questions about the cultural norms of the financial firms.As the existing system of fiat currencies and banking was seen as corrupt and manipulated by a few, Satoshi’s vision was the creation of a new digital currency, named bitcoin, which would enable peer-to-peer payments using cryptography and blockchains. The bitcoin system was radical as it did away with the existing central bank-banking system.Technologists may have contributed to this idea of creating a denationalised currency, but it has economic foundations. Economists such as Ludwig von Mises and Friedrich Hayek had written about denationalising currency by allowing banks to issue their own currency, returning to the era before central banks. The bitcoin project was more radical as the idea was to decentralise the currency creation and management to people.Bitcoin did become reality and also led to multiple players offering their own variant of private cryptocurrencies. However, in this frenzy, the original objective of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies of being a currency and form of payment were soon lost.Money serves three broad functions — as a medium of exchange, unit of account and store of value. These cryptocurrencies hardly serve any of the three functions. Instead, cryptocurrencies became cryptoassets and started trading like any other security, but without any business model. In this phase, they hardly posed any challenge to existing currencies and were mostly ignored by central banks. But some of the cryptos were also used for criminal purposes, and some countries, including India, banned cryptocurrencies.In 2018, Facebook proposed a new digital currency named Libra, which could be used for payments and transfers by Facebook’s large subscriber base. Libra’s value would be more stable as it was to be backed by a reserve of fiat currencies. This new proposition suddenly woke the central bankers up. The central banks started working towards their own digital currencies, called central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). Satoshi would be disappointed, not just seeing cryptocurrencies become cryptoassets but to learn how his initiative eventually led to the creation of CBDCs.Bitcoin’s current surge is difficult to decipher. If the world was preferring bitcoin as a currency, one could still understand this frenzy. But bitcoin’s user base is still insignificant. The likes of Elon Musk have tweeted in support of bitcoin and suggested Tesla would accept payments in Bitcoin. But these are rare exceptions. Bitcoiners forget Hyman Minsky’s words on money: “Everyone can create money; the problem is to get it accepted”.The State plays a critical role in making money acceptable. The State either asks citizens to pay taxes in only State money/currency, driving other currencies out or simply bans them. Bitcoin and other digital currencies never really had a chance unless a country declared them as legal tender.The frenzy reminds one of Charles Kindleberger’s iconic book, Manias, Panics and Crashes: A History of Financial Crises. Most manias are fuelled by easy money/credit, which, in turn, is invested in new investment fads. Eventually, a policy change or firm failure turns the mania into first a panic and finally a crash. Since the 2008 crisis and more so after the 2020 pandemic, the financial markets have been flush with liquidity. This has also been a period where prices of not just bitcoin but most other asset classes have also risen beyond expectations. The big question is how and when this mania will unravel.While it is tempting for investors to be part of this mania, they should remember the words of John Maynard Keynes: “The markets can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent”.Amol Agrawal is a faculty member at Ahmedabad University.

05-04-2021||Today's||Tracing the roots of the US-China discord||Last month, the Joe Biden administration held high-level talks with the Chinese government in Alaska. It did not take long for the talks to descend into acrimony. China’s director of the central foreign affairs commission of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), Yang Jiechi, lost no time in condemning the United States (US) government on a variety of issues — from its problems with racism and the Black Lives Matter movement to undermining stability around the world and meddling in China’s affairs in particular. The response was triggered by US secretary of state Antony Blinken calling out China for its crackdowns in Hong Kong and Xinjiang province, its increasing cyberattacks, and for “threatening the rules-based order that maintains global stability.”The tone reflected sharply, and unusually publicly, the rapidly deteriorating state of US-China relations over the past few years. This downward turn in the relationship could not necessarily have been predicted a couple of decades ago. Rather, it is an outcome of failed expectations, and subsequent frustration on both sides.Today, in the US, there is a widely-held perception that it tried a policy of engagement with China, and this policy was an abject failure. The policy of engagement, whose roots can be traced to President Richard Nixon’s visit to China in the 1970s, was based on bringing China into the US-led liberal international order. Thus, Deng Xiaoping’s economic reforms of the 1980s and 1990s gave hope to American officials that China, by opening its economy, would deeply integrate into the liberal multilateral order. Getting China to embrace free trade, join numerous international institutions, and follow “the rules-based order” would, the US believed, not only perpetuate the primacy of the liberal order but also quite possibly lead to political reform within China. In the most ideal scenario, China would democratise, but failing that, it would at least liberalise its society.The events of Tiananmen Square slightly dented such rosy visions. Other crises — such as the 1996 Taiwan Straits crisis (which demonstrated, to the shock of the US, the level of China’s commitment to Taiwan), and the 1999 accidental North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade (which led to widespread anti-US riots in China) — combined with the fact that the CCP showed no signs of losing its authoritarian grip on Chinese politics and society, eventually led to US disenchantment with the engagement policy.By the 2000s, as China’s military build-up increased, and it became the US’s largest foreign creditor, the US was seeing it as a bone fide threat. In 2018, Aaron Friedberg, Princeton professor and former aide to vice-president Dick Cheney, testified before the US Congress that, “China is now quite clearly a revisionist power. It seeks to change important aspects of the existing order in Asia and increasingly the wider world, as well.”China, meanwhile, began responding to the US in the 1980s and 1990s by adopting Deng Xiaoping’s famous maxim of taoguang yanghui (hide one’s strength and bide one’s time). In doing so, in China’s view, it not only took steps to respond to and engage with the US but it also integrated into the international order — not by adopting American liberal ideologies perhaps, but certainly by engaging with the pieces of it that would facilitate its economic development, particularly financial and monetary institutions and norms. Thus, China believes that a strategy such as the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is the outcome of Beijing successfully following, not flouting, the rules-based order.When the US comments on thorny issues, whether Hong Kong or Xinjiang, China thinks America has neither the standing nor the right to apply its own ideological standards to what are China’s sovereign internal affairs. Accordingly, many Chinese are convinced the US, and western media’s portrayal of China as a threat is both unfair, and racist. And since 2010, when it became the world’s second-largest economy, China has not only become more confident but also convinced that a more assertive stance, its so-called “wolf-warrior diplomacy,” is necessary in order to counter the US’s narratives and naked containment of it.Given these clashing frustrations and the frequent war of words, it is obvious that the Biden administration intends to continue its predecessor’s policies of intensifying strategic competition with China while the Xi Jinping government makes its disdain and belief of American decline clear. The Covid-19 disaster has, far from inducing cooperation in health against a common enemy, added kindling to the fire.Yet, it is worth remembering that the current state of bilateral relations is, as Columbia University professor and former deputy assistant secretary of state for East Asia, Tom Christensen, has pointed out, alarmingly akin to a Greek tragedy with the interaction of flawed actors unwittingly, and even accidentally, leading to painful outcomes. And if left to continue on its current course, it will have catastrophic results for the rest of the world.

05-04-2021||Editorials||At stake, the future of the Indian polity | HT Editorial||On Tuesday, voters in Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Puducherry, Assam and West Bengal will choose elected representatives for their state assemblies (Bengal’s polls will continue through the month). What voters decide on April 6 will play a key role in determining the future of the Indian polity in two fundamental ways.One, the polls will shape the distribution of political power in the system. If the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) wins Assam and Bengal, and is able to retain Tamil Nadu with its ally in the state, the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, it will mark the continued eastern and southern expansion of the party. It will also mark the continued centralisation of the polity, where the idea of a “double engine” government — having the same party in power at the Centre and in the state — has voter approval. This will shrink the space for the Opposition and impact the balance in the federal system. Alternatively, if the Congress wins Assam, the Trinamool Congress retains Bengal, the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam comes back to power in Tamil Nadu, and irrespective of whether the Left or the Congress leads the next government in Kerala, power will get diffused, the Opposition will get energised, and the BJP will face challenges.Second, the outcome will also determine the balance of power within the Opposition camp — and whether it is the Congress which is still seen as the de facto challenger to the BJP or whether it is regional parties which will mount the more decisive challenge. There has been a disjunct between state and national politics, but both intersect too and this intersection will be on test on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/at-stake-the-future-of-the-indian-polity-hteditorial-101617633556959.html

While reports suggest that up to 20 Maoists were killed in the encounter too, there is little doubt that the incident represents a grave setback to the Indian State in general, and security forces in particular. It appears that Maoists planted intelligence about the presence of a dreaded commander, Madvi Hidma, in a particular location; over 1,700 men from various security agencies launched an offensive from Sukma and Bijapur; Maoists then executed a “U-shaped attack” where they fired from the two hilltops as the jawans were at lower levels in two villages, both of which had already been evacuated by the Maoists. The forces walked into the trap, losing brave men and dealing a blow to India’s battle against the Maoist insurgency.The incident reveals State failure at two different levels. One, at the level of principle, any State must have a monopoly over force — the fact that there is an armed insurgent outfit in the country that openly espouses war against the State, in itself, reflects the continued failure of governments across the political spectrum. Two, more specific to this incident, despite denials by security agencies, there has been a clear operational and intelligence failure. Did the forces exercise due diligence on the intelligence they received? Did they follow all SOPs before launching the combing operation? Was there any contingency planning for a scenario where Maoists would launch a surprise attack, which they have done in the past too?While home minister Amit Shah has promised a fitting reply, it is important that the government embark on a careful multi-pronged approach. One, ramp up security and intelligence, track Madvi Hidma, and bring the culprits of the recent attack to justice. Two, enhance coordination between the Centre and all Maoist-affected states. Three, ensure that any security offensive does not lead to human rights violations, which provide fertile ground to Maoists to recruit. Four, ensure participatory development and greater incomes to local population, and ensure justice to stem any sense of alienation. The State must act against Maoist terror, but smartly and carefully. And quickly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/maoists-cross-a-red-line-again-hteditorial-101617633554928.html
