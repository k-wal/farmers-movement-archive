24-03-2021||India||Rajya Sabha clears NCT Bill amid uproar, walkout by opposition parties||The Rajya Sabha on Wednesday cleared the contentious National Capital Territory of Delhi (Amendment) Bill, 2021 that seeks to give overarching powers over Delhi’s daily functioning to the Centre-appointed Lieutenant Governor, despite uproar in the Upper House and a walkout by several opposition parties.The bill was cleared following several hours of heated debate followed by a division of votes demanded by the opposition. Several parties including the Congress, BJD, YSRCP and Samajwadi Party also opposed the Bill and staged a walkout. The opposition also sought a division on votes. During voting, 83 members were in favour while 45 opposed the bill. The bill was cleared by Lok Sabha on Monday. “I would like to tell the people of Delhi and the whole country that we have full belief in the Constitution. We did not bring this bill to create problems for the Delhi govt...I request every member to support the Bill unequivocally,” MoS G Krishna Reddy said in the Rajya Sabha. Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said it was a “sad day for Indian democracy.”“RS passes GNCTD amendment Bill. Sad day for Indian democracy. We will continue our struggle to restore power back to people. Whatever be the obstacles, we will continue doing good work. Work will neither stop nor slow down,” he tweeted.Opposition parties, including the Congress opposed the Bill stating that the proposed legislation was unconstitutional and demanded that it be referred to a select committee for scrutiny.Reddy said the amendments to the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi Act were in no way undemocratic. “We’re making amendments to the Act brought in by Congress in 1991. These are not new. We are bringing these amendments to ensure that Delhi Government functions properly,” Reddy said.The controversial bill says the “government” in Delhi will mean the L-G in the context of all legislation passed by the city-state’s assembly. Also, it makes it mandatory for the city government to seek the L-G’s opinion before any executive action. On Tuesday too, the Rajya Sabha was adjourned following a ruckus by the Opposition as the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi (Amendment) Bill, 2021 was introduced in the House.Amid protests by the opposition, the house witnessed two adjournments in the second half. Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge also said that the Bill should be sent to a select committee.Opposing the bill, AAP MP Sanjay Singh said that the BJP government at the Centre has brought the bill as the party had lost the Delhi assembly elections twice. He said that by opposing the bill he was seeking “justice” for the two crore people of Delhi.Explaining the rationale behind the bill, Reddy said that the amendments have been brought to remove ambiguities in the 1991 Act. He stressed that changes in the law have been sought in the spirit of what has been said in the Supreme Court judgement. He asserted there was no political angle and the amendments were on “technical” grounds.After Rajya Sabha Deputy Chairman Harivansh Narayan Singh asked if the motion on the bill could be adopted, the opposition raised the demand for a division of votes. The division of votes took place manually through paper slips due to Covid-19 protocols.With 83 ‘ayes’ and 45 ‘noes’ the motion that the bill be taken up for consideration was adopted. Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge announced that the Congress too would stage a walk-out to oppose the bill.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajya-sabha-clears-nct-bill-amid-uproar-walkout-by-opposition-parties-101616608158010.html

24-03-2021||India||Twitter vows to crack down on manipulative, misleading content ahead of state assembly elections||Ahead of assembly polls, Twitter on Wednesday resolved to crack down on content that "manipulates or interferes with elections" or contains "misleading information", as the micro-blogging platform outlined a slew of election integrity measures.In a blogpost, Twitter said it is implementing "significant" product, policy, and enforcement updates that have been drawn based on learning from previous elections, both globally and in India. The measures are aimed at tackling poll-related misinformation.Towards this, Twitter has expanded its team, continues to invest in technological solutions and has deployed tools backed by technology to detect abusive content more efficiently.Twitter asserted it is taking proactive measures to prevent prohibited political advertising through comprehensive and nuanced enforcement mechanisms."A global cross-functional team with local, cultural, and language expertise will run our election integrity work. Their role is to keep the service safe from attempts to manipulate the platform and content that can incite violence, abuse, and threats and trigger the risk of offline harm," Twitter explained in the blog.The platform said investment in technological solutions and deployment of tools mean that content that is most likely to cause harm is prioritised for review by the team of specialists to determine whether the content violates the the platform's rules.Voting for five assembly elections will begin on March 27, with West Bengal hosting eight phases over a month. Counting of votes in the four states and one union territory will take place on May 2."Our goal is to make it easy to find credible information on Twitter while limiting the spread of potentially harmful and misleading content. In the context of these elections, we are focussed on Civic integrity and Synthetic and manipulated media," Twitter said.Elaborating on the civic integrity policy, Twitter said it will remove content that manipulates or interferes with elections and is false or contains misleading information about procedures to participate in the election process, amongst others.It also vowed to combat false information intended to intimidate or dissuade people from participating in the elections and voting, such as misleading claims that polling places are closed, polling has ended, or other misleading information relating to votes not being counted, as well as accounts that misrepresent their affiliation with a political candidate or party.Asserting its zero tolerance for platform manipulation and spam, Twitter said it will continue to strengthen the platform against attempted manipulation, including malicious automated accounts and spam, as well as other activities that violate its terms of service."Inauthentic engagement, which includes things like selling/purchasing Tweet or account metric inflation (like Retweets, Likes, mentions, Twitter Poll votes), is a violation and we will take action on accounts that engage in this behavior, which may include permanent suspension," it said.The platform also said that it has not observed any significant manipulation or interference but will continue to conduct proactive enforcement sweeps to detect instances of inauthentic and networked activity that may be associated with the elections.Twitter banned political ads in 2019, the blogpost said, adding, "We believe that political message reach should be earned, not bought, bringing ads from political candidates and political parties to an end.""We are taking proactive measures to prevent prohibited political advertising through comprehensive and nuanced enforcement mechanisms. These include identifying and blocking ads from referenced candidates, parties, and other election-related content," it said.When people attempt to retweet content with a synthetic and manipulated media label, they will see a prompt pointing them to credible information."These Tweets won't be algorithmically recommended by Twitter, which further reduces the visibility of misleading information," it said.Twitter is taking extra measures to ensure people have context to what is trending for them and will include a representative tweet, Twitter Moment or description to the top trends."As explained in our Help Center, there are rules for trends and we will prevent certain terms that violate our Rules from appearing in the Trends section," Twitter pointed out.The micro-blogging platform will be launching an events page dedicated to the assembly elections on voting days and for the election results day."The page will include a timeline of Tweets from credible accounts to provide the latest information on the days of voting and election results," it said.These will be visible to account holders in India in the Explore Tab, and will provide continuous updates and context throughout the election period with multiple language videos from a variety of news partners in the carousel.Twitter has an estimated 1.75 crore users in India, as per data cited by the government recently.Twitter had recently drawn flak over inflammatory tweets and hashtags around farmers' protests, with the micro-blogging service initially refusing to comply with orders to take down about 1,500 such posts and accounts.Twitter had complied after the government showed the rule book that contained penal provisions.Amid growing concerns over rampant abuse of social media platforms and spread of fake news, the government recently announced new regulations for digital platforms, requiring them to take down contentious content quicker, appoint grievance redressal officers and assist investigations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/twitter-vows-to-crack-down-on-manipulative-misleading-content-ahead-of-state-assembly-elections-101616606027659.html

24-03-2021||India||Covid 2nd wave: Doubling time, new mutant, highest spike in Maharashtra | 10 points||On the one-year anniversary of the nationwide lockdown for Covid-19 pandemic, India on Wednesday reported the highest single-day spike of fresh infections in 2021. The health ministry reported that a new double mutant strain of the virus has been found, apart from several other mutant strains (UK, South Africa, Brazil). The uptick in the number of fresh cases continued with Maharashtra reporting the highest single-day spike since the beginning of the pandemic.Here are the top 10 developments regarding Covid-19 in India.> The doubling time of Covid-19 cases has come down from 504.4 days on March 1 to 202.3 days on March 23. This means the infection is taking less time to get doubled.> Maharashtra, Gujarat, Punjab, Madhya Pradesh, Delhi, Tamil Nadu, Chhattisgarh, Karnataka, Haryana and Rajasthan are displaying an upward trajectory in the daily spike.> The situation of Maharashtra and Punjab is of grave concern, the health ministry said.> A total of 771 'variants of concerns' have been detected since December in a total of 1,07,87 positive samples. Out of these 1,07,87 positive samples, 736 samples were found positive for viruses of the UK (B.1.1.7). About 34 samples were found positive for viruses of the South African (B.1.351) lineage. One sample was found positive for viruses of the Brazilian (P.1) lineage.> What is a double mutant strain? When two mutated strains form a third strain, it is called a double mutation. According to government data, the double mutant in India has been formed by E484Q and L452R. Thi has been found in 206 samples from Maharashtra, two samples from Punjab, nine samples from Delhi, one sample from Ladakh and Jammu each, three samples from Gujarat and one sample from Odisha.> Mutation of a virus is very common, Niti Aayog (health) member Dr VK Paul said adding that there is no reason to worry. "When a virus replicates, it does something wrong and that's why something new (a mutant) gets developed. We have to stop the virus from replicating itself. It can happen only if we wear a mask and maintain social distancing because the virus is not getting replicated in the air," he said.> The variants are there for the past six months and they have no resulted in any new symptom of the infection, National Centre for Disease Control's director Dr Sujeet Kumar Singh said.> The variants can not be held responsible for the surge of cases, the Centre said. "Wherever the pool of susceptible population is bigger and when they lower the guard by not following Covid appropriate behaviours, they are prone to infection," Dr Singh said. > Maharashtra on Wednesday reported 31,855 new Covid-19 cases, the highest since the beginning of the pandemic. Mumbai reported 5,185 new infections in its highest spike ever.> Registration for vaccination of anyone above the age of 45 years will be open on April 1 on Cowin.gov.in. There is no scarcity of vaccines in the country, the Centre said. The gap between two doses of Covishield has been increased to six to eight weeks. But it should not be increased more than that, the Centre said. It also dismissed concerns of blood-clotting by the Covishield vaccine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-2nd-wave-doubling-time-new-mutant-highest-spike-in-maharashtra-10-points-101616603449496.html

24-03-2021||India||Day after IED attack on bus carrying DRG jawans, Chhattisgarh police clueless||A day after the IED attack on a bus ferrying security forces in Narayanpur by Maoists, the Chhattisgarh police is perplexed about how the IEDs were planted and triggered near a culvert on the road, when a Road Opening Party (ROP) was guarding the stretch for the safe passage of security forces.On Tuesday, special director general (Anti-Naxal operations), Ashok Juneja told the media that demining of the road was also done for the movement of security forces, which raises questions about how IEDs were not detected even after the exercise.In Maoist affected areas, a police party which is called ‘ROP’ is deployed on both sides of the road before any movement of security forces or VIPs.The ROP sanitizes around 100 meters on both sides of the road to avert any possible ambush or Maoist movement.Intelligence sources said that the IEDs were wrapped in a carbon paper and were planted just ahead of the culvert where the blasts took place, but senior police officials denied the theory.Officials also believe that a better network of human and technical intelligence would have alerted security agencies regarding the incident, but it was not properly done.Around 90 DRG jawans were returning in four buses after a two-day anti-Naxal operation which took place in the jungles of Abujhmad in Narayapur district when the blast took place on Tuesday evening on the under-construction Barsoor-Palli road which is surrounded by the dense forest of Abujhmad. The buses were moving on the road with a gap of 15 minutes and the first bus was targeted by Maoists with three IEDs.Five jawans who were sitting on the front seats of the bus, including the driver were killed since the blast took place as soon as the bus reached a culvert on the road. A total of 17 were injured and four are admitted to a hospital in Raipur.“As most of the IED incidents have happened near culverts, security forces should have been present near the culvert so that IED handlers would not have dared to trigger the IED. How is this possible that even after ROP was deployed, someone was within 100 meters near the culvert and triggered the bomb? This raises serious concerns over the ROP. What if the Maoists were in a team and ambushed the jawans? It would have led to more casualties,” a senior police official who did not wish to be named said.Officials believe that a blast could have been averted if bikes were used to bring back companies to base camps instead of buses.“As the location of the forces was revealed during the operation, the Maoists must have noticed that DRG comes back to district headquarters after every operation. Maoists must have been following the bus from the origin and thus must be doing real time monitoring,” another official said.Director General of Police, DM Awasthi, who visited the spot said that he had ordered an investigation to arrest the accused.“I have asked the concerned official to provide all necessary details about the attack,” the DGP said.When asked how the Maoists managed to trigger the IED when there was ROP guarding the road, Inspector General of Police, Bastar Range, Sunderaj P said that the cadres who triggered the explosion were in civil camouflage.“The Maoists must have used IEDs of around 30 kg. It was a command IED operated by electric wire and battery for power source. Since, the place of the incident is a dense forest and most likely the IEDs were operated by a couple of cadres in civil camouflage. After road opening was done by security forces, demining was also done but unfortunately the IED were not detected. We are examining the reasons and modus operandi,” said the IG.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/day-after-ied-attack-on-a-bus-carrying-security-forces-in-narayanpur-chhattisgarh-police-still-clueless-101616598077389.html
24-03-2021||India||Highest-ever spike in Maharashtra: Over 31,000 new Covid cases in 24 hours||Maharashtra on Wednesday reported 31,855 new Covid-19 cases, in the highest-ever single-day spike in the state since the beginning of the pandemic in March last year, as Mumbai for the first time recorded more than 5,000 cases in 24 hours. The spike comes at a time when the health ministry has expressed serious concerns over the present Covid-19 situation in a few districts, including Maharashtra. The state recorded 30,535 infections on March 21, 2020, which was the highest single-day spike for the state so far.Among the districts contributing to the state's sharpest spike ever is Nagpur, which on Wednesday reported 3,717 new cases. This is also the district's highest single-day figure so far.Out of the top 10 districts in the country that have the highest number of active Covid-19 cases at present, nine are in the state, including Pune, Nagpur, Mumbai, Thane, Nashik, Aurangabad, Nanded, Jalgaon and Akola, the Union health ministry said on Wednesday.The Union health ministry has also confirmed that a new double mutant strain has been found in over 200 samples from Maharashtra. But it can not be linked to the spike, it said.The Covid-19 situation of Maharashtra is particularly worrying as the spike started just ahead of a festive season. Though the Centre has asked all states to resort to local restrictions and lockdowns during the upcoming festivals of Holi, Navratri, crowding is still taking place. Amid the ongoing strict lockdown in Nagpur, people on Wednesday were seen taking a bus in the district.Here's how Maharashtra's daily cases spiralled in MarchThe state has been witnessing a sharp spike in the number of daily infections since February. But the rate of increase tripled between February and March, according to data.Between February 14 and March 23, in the span of 37 days, 4,68,748 cases were added in the state, taking the caseload to 25,33,026. On average, 12,668 cases were added daily, PTI reported.What triggered the spikeAccording to the reports, prepared by the government's expert panel, the spike can not be attributed to any single reason. Civic body elections, pandemic fatigue which translated to flouting social distancing norms, not wearing masks in public places, crowded public transport — all contributed to the spike.Is lockdown solution?The Centre has asked district authorities to impose local lockdown after reviewing the situation, but increasing testing and the pace of vaccination is being seen as the only way out of the worsening situation, apart from a strict adherence to Covid-19 guidelines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/over-31-000-new-covid-cases-95-deaths-in-maharashtra-in-24-hours-101616597605207.html

Such probes typically take several months.WhatsApp's conduct in sharing users' data with other Facebook firms, in a way that is "neither fully transparent nor based on voluntary and specific user consent", appears unfair to users, the watchdog added.The CCI said WhatsApp had told the antitrust body that the policy update, which becomes effective in May, raised no competition law concerns.WhatsApp did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday.In India, users concerned about privacy have downloaded rival apps such as Signal and Telegram, according to data from research firms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/competition-commission-of-india-orders-probe-into-whatsapp-s-new-privacy-policy-101616594816949.html

Many of them were using their ranks after retirement even before this decision.“The SSC officers, after completion of their mandated terms and conditions of service, had not been authorised to use the military ranks. This has been causing dissatisfaction and discontentment among the SSC officers who serve under the same service conditions and face similar hardships as permanent commission officers with similar service profile,” the ministry said in a statement.The decision will not only remove dissatisfaction and discontentment among the retired SSC officers, but it will serve as a big boost to young aspirants, it said. “In addition, this decision will act as morale booster for the existing SSC officers.”According to the ministry, the demand for use of ranks by SSC officers after release from service was pending since 1983. “There have been several attempts to make the SSC attractive. Permission to allow use of military ranks by these officers has been one of their major demands,” the statement said.Several retired SSC officers Hindustan Times spoke to said they were using their military ranks after retirement and were never told that they were not authorised to do so.“I have always used my rank after retirement. Lot of my course-mates also use their rank in Civvy Street,” said a retired SSC woman officer.The SSC officers form the backbone of the support cadre of the army, the statement said. “It appears there was some ambiguity about the use of ranks by SSC officers after 10-14 years of service. The government has now made it official that they can use their ranks,” people familiar with the development said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-allows-retired-short-service-officers-to-use-their-ranks-101616590305130.html
24-03-2021||India||Opposition parties caution government against going ahead with disinvestment amid pandemic||Opposition parties in Rajya Sabha on Wednesday urged the government not to go ahead with its ambitious disinvestment plan, saying it would not yield the desired results due to the coronavirus pandemic.Participating in a discussion on the Finance Bill 2021, NCP leader Praful Patel said that while disinvestment is a core theme of this Budget, the government should proceed cautiously on it, given the backdrop of the pandemic.The government on Monday budgeted ₹1.75 lakh crore from stake sale in public sector companies and financial institutions, including two PSU banks and one insurance company, in 2021-22.For 2020-21, the government had set a target of raising ₹2.1 lakh crore from privatisation and sale of minority stakes in state-owned companies. This includes ₹1.20 lakh crore from selling stake in CPSEs and ₹90,000 crore from stake sale in financial investment.So far this fiscal, the government has garnered around ₹31,000 crore through divestment in PSUs, according to the latest update on the portal of the Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM).Emphasising that he is not against divestment, Patel, however, questioned the "timing" and said the exercise may not yield the best possible results that the government is hoping for."I worry because of the Covid situation, you may not be able to realise the full value, so you should go cautiously into it," he said.Patel claimed that the disinvestment process had "not been resounding success so far"."I am not against disinvestment at all. But I want to remind you that in the last 1-2 years if you see the divestment process, you have said our collection is as per target. But if you go into the fine print, proceeds have come from where? LIC or another PSU. There is hardly any money you have recovered from the market or private source," he said.On GST, he said many states were facing the problem of delay in payment. "As we speak, there is a large number of recoveries of GST to be made by states," he said.Despite a firm assurance by the Centre in the past that states will not be worse off, somewhere down the line, those assurances have been reneged on, he said and referred to the issue of guarantee of minimum collection."In Finance Committee, we have asked this question to your officers and we have been told that nothing of that sort exists, whatever is collected, you will get it. There is no guarantee of minimum collection, which would have been given to states as was promised in the House during the passage of the GST Council Bill," he said, urging the government to consider corrective action.Manoj Kumar Jha (RJD) said that while the need to raise revenue is understandable, must it be done "by entering into the brazen sale of public assets.""Every third day I get representation from Vizag Steel plant...there is representation by bank employees... When you take decisions, it impacts the relations and identity of the employees of those organisations. Why not have a dialogue with them," Jha said.On the disinvestment target for 2021-22, Congress Member Rajeev Satav said it is very ambitious and the government has not met the targets in recent years."If the disinvestment target is not achieved then the deficit would grow," he added.Even the CAG in one of its reports had said some disinvestments have only resulted in the transfer of resources within the public sector and did not lead to any change in the public sector, Satav said.Citing the sale of oil PSU HPCL to another government-run ONGC, Satav said the government was merely transferring assets of one public enterprise to another.Over the government's policy on disinvestment, BJP member Jyotiraditya Scindia said some PSUs have become a liability."The government is doing disinvestment of capital assets. It is not selling the country but making efforts to develop the nation," he said alleging that the opposition is doing politics even at the time of such crisis, while the government is striving for the country's development.V. Vijayasai Reddy (YSRCP) was not in favour of disinvestment plans particularly for Vizag steel plant and also demanded special status for Andhra Pradesh.Others who spoke included Ram Gopal Yadav (SP), T K S Elangovan (DMK), Amar Patnaik (BJD) Ram Nath Thakur (JD-U), Ram Gopal Yadav (SP), and Jharna Das Baidya, (CPI-M) and Arpita Ghosh (TMC).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/opposition-parties-caution-government-against-going-ahead-with-disinvestment-amid-pandemic-101616589556117.html

He said the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is killing democracy and questioned that if this is happening with elected leaders, then the law and order situation in the state beggars descriptionOn Tuesday evening, the Bihar assembly witnessed unprecedented ruckus over the Bihar Special Armed Police Bill 2021, where police personnel reached the assembly premises and evicted the MLAs from the assembly. Women MLAs of the opposition parties were also carried out of the assembly building by women security personnel. This happened after a few of the opposition leaders restricted Speaker Vijay Kumar Sinha from leaving his chamber.Also Read | RJD walks out from Rajya Sabha as members not allowed to raise state issue"Incident in Bihar Assembly is condemnable. I have never seen police beating women MLAs. BJP is killing democracy. If this is happening with elected leaders, then what about the law & order situation in the state. If Bihar Police law passed, it'll give leeway to them,” said Mallikarjun Kharge, reported news agency ANI.The opposition is opposing the bill as its provision allows special armed police to conduct searches and make arrests without the requirement of a warrant.Earlier in the day, opposition party the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader Tejashwi Yadav threatened to boycott the assembly session if the state government of Nitish Kumar does not apologise.Attacking the BJP and the Janata Dal (United)-led government that passed the bill, Kharge said they talk about democracy but passed the bill. Citing the misuse of central agencies like the ED, CBI, I-T by the Centre, he said the same misuse will happen in Bihar and create problems in the future.“They (BJP & JDU) talk about democracy but passed the bill. We know they will misuse it. Today ED, CBI, I-T are being misused at the Centre, the same misuse will happen in Bihar & create problems in future,” ANI quoted Kharge as saying.In protest of Tuesday’s ruckus over the bill, opposition MLAs held their parallel assembly session chaired by RJD leader Bhudev Choudhary in the lawns of the assembly while the state legislative assembly proceedings were carried out on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-is-killing-democracy-kharge-on-bihar-assembly-ruckus-101616588865916.html

The quantum of sentence will be pronounced this Friday.While Touseef and Rehaan have been found guilty by the court, a third accused, Mohammad Azruddin, has been acquitted. Azruddin had allegedly supplied weapons to the other two, news agency ANI reported.21-year-old Tomar was shot dead in broad daylight by her former classmate outside her college in Faridabad on October 26 last year. The family of the woman linked the killing to the reported cases of 'love jihad'. Tomar's kins claimed that her attacker was infatuated with her while the other accused is his associate.CCTV camera footage of the incident purportedly shows Touseef and Rehaan trying to force Tomar, a BCom final-year student, into their vehicle when she exits Aggarwal College after writing an exam, the police said. The brutal murder was caught on camera, which showed that the accused, who arrived at the spot in a vehicle, tried to pull Tomar inside, in a possible bid to abduct her. But he was instead met with resistance from the woman, after which the accused shot her. After the murder, a special investigation team (SIT) was formed on October 27, led by Anil Kumar Yadav, assistant commissioner of police (crime), to probe the case. On November 6, the SIT filed a 700-page charge sheet, listing as many as 60 witnesses, in the murder case. Fingerprints were also matched from three samples — from the car, the pistol, and the woman’s arm.The charges against the suspects were framed on November 23 and the trial in the case began on December 1.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nikita-tomar-murder-2-including-prime-accused-found-guilty-by-haryana-court-101616587271122.html
24-03-2021||India||Double mutant Covid strain found in Nagpur, but not linked with surge: Centre||The Union health ministry on Wednesday clarified that the double mutant strain of the Covid-19 virus is not being directly linked to the surge in the number of infections. The surge can be attributed to the pool of susceptible population in any particular area, who are not adhering to Covid-19 appropriate norms. Such a population will be vulnerable to any strain, including the one seen in 2020, National Centre for Disease Control's director Dr Sujeet Kumar Singh said.The Union health ministry of Wednesday published a detailed report on the genome sequencing work that the Indian SARS-CoV-2 Consortium on genomics did in the past few months and said 771 variants of concerns (VOCs) have been detected in a total of 10,787 positive samples shared by states and UTs. These included the UK variant, the South African variant and the Brazil variant.Apart from these three mutants, the Centre also mentioned a double mutant variant, which is new. "Such mutations confer immune escape and increased infectivity," it said.According to government data, the double mutant strain has also been found in two samples from Punjab, one sample from Ladakh and Jammu each, three samples from Gujarat and one sample from Odisha."...double mutant is evolving. We have seen this double mutant E484Q and L452R. This is the double mutant which has been observed in 206 samples in Maharashtra and then in a varied number in Delhi, nine samples, and so on," Dr Singh said."Now when we link we have to see from where the samples have been picked. This is very very relevant. In Nagpur, yes, we have found a substantial number of this, around 20 per cent. But correlating the surge with this 20 per cent is not possible," he added.Going further into the details of the strain found in Nagpur, Dr Singh said, "Eight wards of Nagpur saw a surge. These eight wards are those which were least affected in the earlier surge. So the pool of susceptible population in those eight wards was comparatively large."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/double-mutant-covid-variants-found-in-maharashtra-delhi-not-linked-to-surge-says-centre-101616587065758.html

Apart from these two states, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Chandigarh, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka are reporting a concentration of cases, health secretary Rajesh Bhushan said, adding that a meeting has been called with these states on Saturday to review their Covid-19 situation.Nine out of the top 10 districts with the highest active number of Covid-19 cases — Pune, Nagpur, Mumbai, Thane, Nashik, Aurangabad, Nanded, Jalgaon and Akola — are in Maharashtra, the ministry said. Only one, Bengaluru Urban, is in Karnataka, the ministry said.Terming the situation as "concerning", Niti Aayog (health) member VK Paul said the solution lies in strengthening surveillance as it was done last year. He also added that vaccination must be stepped up in these states Covid-19: Double mutant strain, 771 variants detected in India, says govtExplaining the Centre's decision on opening the vaccination drive to anyone above the age of 45 years, Rajesh Bhushan said, "About 88 per cent of all Covid-19 deaths in the country are taking place above the age group of 45 years. The case fatality rate above 45 years is 2.85 per cent. So this age group is vulnerable and the decision has been taken based on scientific inputs."The age-based approach towards vaccination is recognised by the World Health Organizations as well, VK Paul said. "We have enough vaccines. We have a seamless connection with the states. We take stock of the situation every day," he said."There is room for great improvement as far as the involvement of private facilities in vaccination. As of now, there are 5,425 private centre administering vaccines, while the number of government facilities is 34,481. From April, the private sector should increase their involvement more as we are opening up the vaccination drive," Paul said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-rise-in-8-states-including-punjab-is-of-grave-concern-centre-101616584042787.html

A crowd soon gathered and attacked the cops, confined and thrashed them, police said.Following this, Buxar’s sub divisional police officer (SDPO) K K Singh rushed to the village with reinforcement and rescued them. Police said that a case was lodged against Rajbhar in Nagsar police station of Gazipur district of UP for abducting a minor girl. According to the FIR, Rajbhar who was residing in his sister’s house at Khadwal village, abducted the minor and took her to his native village.The SDPO said Rajbhar dodged the Gazipur police team and managed to escape while his family members and accomplices obstructed the cops and also tried to snatch their firearms. Some of them also pelted stones at the policemen. The injured police personnel are undergoing treatment and their condition is now out of danger. The girl’s brother and mother who had come with the Gazipur police team were also attacked. The girl was not found either. “They attacked the police team and created a ruckus. Bhulan’s father and women confined the local chowkidar Harendra, mother and brother of abducted girl in their house. They also thrashed them. Soon, the additional force reached there and rescued them. The police have arrested Shivpujan Rajbhar, Tetri Devi, Guriya Devi and Sarita Rajbhar,” said the SDPO.A case has been lodged against 15 identified and several unknown accused under sections 307 (attempt to murder), 353 (assault or criminal force to deter a public servant from discharge of his duty), 186 (obstructing a public servant in discharge of public functions), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 506 (criminal intimidation), 201 (causing disappearance of evidence of offence) of the IPC.A senior official at the Bihar police headquarters in Patna revealed that the Englishpur village of Buxar district is notorious for attacks on policemen.In September 2009, villagers attacked a police team when it tried to catch two absconders. On August 11, 2012 they attacked on police team when a contraband smuggler was caught. On May 27, 2020 a Government Railway Police (GRP) team of six men from Chhapra came under attack when they raided a house to arrest train robbers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/6-up-cops-injured-during-raid-in-bihar-s-buxar-to-recover-abducted-girl-101616582045373.html
24-03-2021||India||Covid-19: Double mutant strain, 771 variants detected in India, says govt||A double mutation found in the Sars-CoV-2 virus that causes coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in Maharashtra is of concern as these mutations have not been yet catalogued, the Union ministry of health and family welfare announced on Wednesday.“The analysis of samples from Maharashtra has revealed that compared to December 2020, there has been an increase in the fraction of samples with the E484Q and L452R mutations. Such mutations confer immune escape and increased infectivity. These mutations have been found in about 15-20% of samples and do not match any previously catalogued variants of concern (VOCs),” said health ministry in a statement.“These have been categorised as VOCs but require the same epidemiological and public health response of ‘increased testing, comprehensive tracking of close contacts, prompt isolation of positive cases & contacts as well as treatment as per National Treatment Protocol’ by the states and Union Territories,” the statement added.Since the Indian SARS-CoV-2 Consortium on Genomics (INSACOG) initiated its work, 771 variants of concerns (VOCs) have been detected in a total of 10,787 positive samples shared by States/UTs. These comprise 736 samples positive for viruses of the UK (B.1.1.7) lineage, 34 samples were found positive for viruses of the South African (B.1.351) lineage, and 1 sample was found positive for viruses of the Brazilian (P.1) lineage.The samples with these VOCs have been identified in 18 states of the country.Genome sequencing and analysis have been carried out on samples from arriving international travelers, contacts of those positive for VOC and community samples from most of the states at INSACOG partner laboratories.In December, 2020, the ministry of health established INSACOG that is a group of 10 national laboratories meant to perform genome sequencing of positive samples. INSACOG has been carrying out genomic sequencing and analysis of circulating Covid-19 viruses. Also Read | 6 states which added the most to India’s highest 1-day death toll in this yearAccording to the health ministry, from Kerala 2,032 samples (from all 14 districts) have been sequenced. The N440K variant that is associated with immune escape has been found in 123 samples from 11 districts. This variant was earlier found in 33% of samples from Andhra Pradesh, and in 53 of 104 samples from Telangana. It has also been reported from 16 other countries, including UK, Denmark, Singapore, Japan, and Australia. As of now, these can be, at best, said to be variant under investigation.“Though VOCs and a new double mutant variant have been found in India, these have not been detected in numbers sufficient to either establish a direct relationship or explain the rapid increase in cases in some states. Genomic sequencing and epidemiological studies are continuing to further analyse the situation,” the ministry statement further read.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-double-mutant-strain-771-variants-detected-in-india-says-govt-101616582043779.html
24-03-2021||India||' ₹7 lakh crore being spent on building green express highways': Nitin Gadkari||The government is spending ₹7 lakh crore on building green express highways through modern technology which in turn would provide smart transportation and reduce pollution, Union Minister Nitin Gadkari said on Wednesday.Of these, ₹1 lakh crore Delhi-Mumbai Expressway is likely to be completed within a year while Delhi-Meerut Expressway will be inaugurated in a month or two, the Road Transport and Highways Minister said while addressing a virtual event organised by PHD Chamber of Commerce here."We are spending ₹7 lakh crore on building green express highways. These...will reduce air pollution, traffic jam and minimise logistics and transportation cost," he said at the National Roads & Highways Summit "Focus on Green Infrastructure".He said these are being built with state-of-the-art technique with advanced engineering to provide intelligent traffic while taking care of the ecology and environment conservation with an aim to reduce green house emission.The Prime Minister has set a target of ₹111 lakh crore under the National Infrastructure Pipeline and it would be the government's effort to adopt a green approach and "development without destruction," the minister said.Of the 22 green highway corridors, Delhi-Mumbai Expressway on a new alignment would reduce the travel time between both the metropolises to 12 hours by car in comparison to 40 hours at present, he said."Sixty per cent of this 1,300 km project has been completed and we are trying to complete it within one year," the minister said adding that the first phase of Delhi-Mumbai Expressway project will have 8 lanes while the second phase will have 12.A separate electric highway lane will be constructed in it, he said and added that within a year electric trucks will be available.Gadkari said work on Delhi-Amritsar-Katra project is likely to start in two to three months and in the pipeline are ₹4,063 crore Delhi-Faridabad-Sohna express highway and ₹4,000 crore Ahmedabad-Dholera highway.As far as Delhi is concerned, Gadkari said projects worth ₹60,000 crore are being implemented to reduce air pollution in the national capital and said ₹10,000 crore Dwarka-Express Highway is an "engineering marvel".He said 50 per cent work has been completed on the 30 km project that has one tunnel and flyovers.Urban Extension Road-II (UER-II) project for Delhi has also been cleared, Gadkari said."Delhi-Meerut expressway will be inaugurated in next one to two months and it will reduce the travel time to Meerut from Delhi to 45 minutes from the present 4 hours," Gadkari said.The minister said with the completion of Delhi-Saharanpur-Dehradun project, the travel time between Delhi and Dehradun will reduce to two hours and "it is a promise not declaration.".Projects will also ensure Delhi to Chandigarh in 2 hours and Delhi to Haridwar also in 2 hours, he said.The minister said the ₹12,000 crore Chardham project to provide all-weather connectivity to Gangotri, Yamunotri, Badrinath and Kedarnath is nearing completion and will boost tourism in Uttarakhand.In addition, priority will also be given to the ₹12,000 crore Raipur-Visakhapatnam project and ₹10,000 crore Bengaluru Ring Road project besides Surat-Ahmedabad, Durg-Raipur, Chennai-Salem projects.The minister exuded confidence that the national highways' building pace will reach 40-km a day by March-end.He said the ministry has already exceeded the target for building 11,000 km of highways in the current fiscal year and till date it has constructed 12,205 km which translates into 34-km a day.Also, he said the Centre has signed a USD 500 million contract with the World Bank for constructing safe and green corridors in Rajasthan, Himachal Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh.He also warned the cement and steel industry to not indulge in cartelisation and said that he was "not happy with the attitude of steel and cement industry".He noted that emphasis was being laid on using innovative materials like jute, coir, plastic, rubber and other material.Asserting that toll income was likely to reach ₹1,34,000 crore in next three to four years, he said ₹10,000 crore was lost due to COVID-19 but by March-end, toll collection was likely to reach ₹31,000 crore.He said as part of automation, GPS-based tolling is being planned where toll collection will be done based on actual distance traversed by the vehicle through GPS.Smart vehicle tracking system is on the anvil, the minister said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rs-7-lakh-crore-being-spent-on-building-green-express-highways-nitin-gadkari-101616580321379.html

Jha and some other members of the RJD then staged a walkout in protest.Jha stood up to raise the issue soon after scheduled papers were laid on the table of the House, and said a "heinous crime" has taken place and even women MLAs were not spared."I have gone through your (Jha) notice. It is a matter concerning the state so I cannot take it up...You can take up the issue in the State itself," Naidu said.As Jha insisted on raising the issue, Kharge said the Rajya Sabha Chairman has the discretion to allow a discussion on an issue related to "injustice" in a state, and urged Naidu to let Jha speak.However, Naidu did not agree and suggested that a common policy be evolved on whether state related issues should be taken up or not."Next time, let us have a meeting of all parties, not in the Business Advisory Committee, but in the general purpose committee and you all people can come to a conclusion that Rajya Sabha can take up issues of states," he said.He said the other day some people wanted to take up the Maharashtra issue, but he did not permit them."Now somebody want to raise the Bihar issue and tomorrow somebody else wants to raise some other state issue. If we can discuss and have a common approach, and a common policy. If it suits me I will raise this issue otherwise I will oppose. I can't do that," Naidu said.The Bihar Assembly witnessed unprecedented turmoil on Tuesday and the police was called in to physically evict opposition legislators who had laid siege to the Speaker's chamber. They were protesting against the Police Special Powers Bill.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rjd-walks-out-from-rajya-sabha-as-members-not-allowed-to-raise-state-assembly-issue-101616579655021.html

Diesel now comes for ₹81.30 a litre in the national capital, down from ₹81.47 previously.Rates have been reduced across the country and vary from state-to-state depending on the local incidence of taxation (VAT).This is the first reduction in fuel prices in over a year. The prices were last reduced on March 16, 2020."It is not possible to bring petrol and diesel under GST regime in the next eight to 10 years because states would not be ready for an annual revenue loss of ₹2 lakh crore (collectively by all states)," Modi told the House."If petrol or diesel would be brought under the Goods and Services Tax (GST) regime then how would the loss of ₹2 lakh crore revenue to states be recovered. The Centre and states together earn over ₹5 lakh crore from tax on petroleum products," he said.He explained that if petroleum products are brought under the GST, 28 per cent tax would be collected on them as that is the highest slab in the tax regime."Presently, 60 per cent tax is being collected on petroleum products. This would result in shortfall of ₹2 lakh crore to 2.5 lakh crore (to both Centre and states)," he explained in the House."If we collect 28 per cent tax on petroleum products, then only ₹14 would be collected (per litre) against ₹60 at present," he pointed out."If petrol or diesel price is ₹100 (per litre) then the tax component is ₹60 which includes ₹35 for Centre and ₹25 for respective states. Besides out of the ₹35 tax per litre, 42 per cent goes to states," Modi added.He also stated,"It is said that tax collected on petrol, diesel goes into the pocket of government. There is no separate pocket of government. From where the money will come for providing electricity and tap water to all households. The spending of tax collection on welfare of country is being challenged."Reacting to remarks against the GST regime, he said,"Some people also said that this is Gabbar Singh Tax. No state has opposed the tax structure of GST in any GST Council meeting. You can see the proceedings of the council (to verify that)," he said.He stressed that only the government under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi had the guts to implement the GST regime in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/not-possible-to-bring-petrol-diesel-under-gst-for-next-8-10-years-sushil-modi-101616573802423.html

Anybody can be shareholders of that company like Senthil Balaji," he further said."Senthil Balaji tried to topple our government. History always showed that 'Dharma' always wins.

24-03-2021||India||Kerala CM Vijayan condemns 'harassment' of nuns in UP||Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Wednesday strongly condemned the alleged harassment of a group of nuns by some Bajrang Dal activists in UP's Jhansi recently and urged the Centre to take action, saying such incidents tarnish the image of the nation. In his letter to Union Home Minister Amit Shah, Vijayan sought strict action against those "who disrupt and impair the freedom of individual rights" guaranteed by the Constitution.Citing reports, he said two postulants, who had recently joined a Christian congregation were travelling for the first time to their homes accompanied by two nuns and were "harassed and intimidated" by the Bajrang Dal activists. The CM further said the nuns and the postulants were forcefully removed from the train by the police following a complaint from the Bajrang Dal members alleging that the two girls were being taken for forceful religious conversion."You would agree with me that such incidents tarnish the image of the nation and its ancient tradition of religious tolerance and practice." "Such incidents require utmost condemnation by the Union Government," Vijayan said. Earlier, addressing the media in Pathanamthitta, Vijayan said the Constitution gives freedom to everyone in the country to believe and not to believe in any religion. Everyone here has the right to live according to their faith, he added. ".. What happened yesterday was an encroachment on the freedom. Both these freedoms are fundamental rights of Indians. The nuns faced the violation of these rights during the train journey," he pointed out. What happened in Uttar Pradesh should not have happened in the country and it is a "very serious matter." Vijayan also attacked the ruling BJP in UP, saying the northern state is 'notorious' for such matters. "Violence in the name of religion is on the rise in many parts of our country. Violence against women and marginalized groups are on the rise." "Uttar Pradesh is notorious for such matters. All such illegal activities are taking place under the ruling BJP government there. It should also be taken seriously that all this is happening on an uncontrolled scale," Vijayan said. He asserted that his government would not allow Kerala to become a breeding ground for communalism andsecularism would be fully protected. According to officials in Jhansi, the nuns were detained after local Bajrang Dal activists complained that two of the women were allegedly being taken forcibly for religious conversion. The police said there was no basis in the complaint and all four women later took the next train to their destination in Odisha. Expressing concern over the matter, Kerala Catholic Bishops Council had called for strong action against the culpritsinvolved in the incident. The Congress and BJP had taken up the matter with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, respectively.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-cm-vijayan-condemns-harassment-of-nuns-in-up-101616575612141.html

24-03-2021||India||Biden administration views India as important partner in countering China: Experts||With China's growing assertiveness in the Indian Ocean region, the Joe Biden administration in the US sees India as its most important partner to counter Beijing's ambitions.US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin called India an "increasingly important partner among today's rapidly shifting international dynamic", saying the bilateral relationship is a "stronghold of a free and open Indo-Pacific region", reported The Standard.Recently, Austin met Defence Minister Rajnath Singh over the weekend on his first foreign trip in the role as the two sides concluded talks on defense cooperation. Austin also visited Japan and South Korea last week, Washington's closest military allies in Asia."It's important that the secretary of defence has made a trip to India on his first trip to Asia, along with Japan and South Korea," Dhruva Jaishankar, Executive Director at think tank Observer Research Foundation America, said on an American news channel.He also said the Biden administration's investment in the Quad -- the informal strategic alliance between the US, India, Australia and Japan -- is equally important.Beijing has significantly expanded its engagements in the Indian Ocean over the last three decades and has been especially active since 2008.A Brookings Institution report last June said American and Indian strategists are worried about China's growing naval presence as well as its use of "debt-trap diplomacy," which could provide Beijing with military advantages, reported The Standard.China set up its first overseas military base in Djibouti in the Horn of Africa in 2017 and has invested in developing, managing or acquiring strategically located ports in countries surrounding India, including Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Myanmar."There is a growing Chinese presence in the Indian Ocean region," said Arun Singh, a former Indian ambassador to the United States.According to ORFA's Jaishankar, India's navy has also increased its patrols over the last few years as New Delhi has taken a much more activist approach to humanitarian assistance and disaster relief across the Indian Ocean region.As China and India more frequently bicker over the area, there is bound to be some natural convergence between New Delhi and Washington, he said. While it is not as significant as its presence in the Pacific Ocean, the United States does have a permanent presence in the Indian Ocean region through military bases in the Middle East, Djibouti and Diego Garcia island, which is part of British Indian Ocean Territory, Jaishankar explained.The US-India relationship has developed in "significant leaps and bounds" over past years, in part driven by shared concerns about China, according to Jaishankar."We are at a stage where, while they are not allies, the US and India conduct a significant number of military exercises between themselves and with other partners involving all three military services," he said.This includes a trilateral naval exercise between the US, Japan and India called the Malabar games. Last year, India also invited Australia to participate.Under the Donald Trump administration, the US last year had also signed an agreement that grants India access to US satellite data crucial for targeting missiles and other military assets. It was the last of four foundational defence agreements that the US typically signs with close allies which allow for the exchange of sensitive and classified information.Furthermore, US is becoming a major supplier of military equipment to India, behind Russia, reported The Standard.India intends to buy 30 armed drones from the US to step up sea and land defenses as tensions with China and Pakistan persist.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/biden-administration-views-india-as-important-partner-in-countering-china-experts-101616575905786.html

Passengers who could not fly due to the pandemic-induced lockdown last year were to be provided full refund by order of the Supreme Court. IndiGo, the country’s largest airline by market share, said that since the resumption of complete operations in May 2020, it has been rapidly refunding amounts owed to customers whose flights were cancelled during the lockdown.The airline spokesperson said, “The airline has already processed close to ₹1,030 crore in refunds, which amounts to about 99.95% of the total amount owed to its customers. The pending credit shells are mostly cash transactions wherein IndiGo is awaiting bank transfer details from the customers.”Also Read | Roll back ban on posting on social media, digital platforms: Air India pilotsAdvocate Shirish Deshpande, chairman of Mumbai Grahak Panchayat, a Mumbai-based consumer organisation, said that the situation seems to be improving as the number of complaints against airlines have decreased.Ronojoy Dutta, chief executive officer, IndiGo said, “The sudden onset of Covid-19 and the resulting lockdown, brought our operations to a complete halt by the end of March, 2020. As our incoming cash flow through ticket sales was impacted, we were unable to immediately process refunds for cancelled flights and had to create credit shells for the refunds that were due to our customers. However, with the resumption of operations and a steady increase in demand for air travel, our priority has been to refund the credit shell amounts in an expedited manner.

24-03-2021||India||Healthcare workers bill will give dignity to health professionals: Harsh Vardhan||Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan on Wednesday said paramedics and allied healthcare workers are a critical part of the medical profession and their contribution is similar to doctors, if not more.Initiating the debate on the National Commission for Allied and Healthcare Professions Bill, 2021, Vardhan said the proposed legislation has the potential to bring a paradigm shift in health professionals' situation."The paramedics and allied healthcare workers are critical part of the medical profession and their contribution is similar to doctors, if not more. The group of allied professionals is large and the bill is trying to regulate this field, by providing dignity to their roles," he said.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageThe bill has already been passed by the Rajya Sabha.Recalling the role played by paramedics and allied health care workers lab technicians, radiographers, dieticians during the Coronavirus pandemic, the minister said they were as much part of the people's recovery as the doctors.He said the bill aims to establish a statutory body or commission that frames policies and standards, regulate professional conduct and qualifications for allied healthcare professionals besides providing uniformity of service standards across institutions.Vardhan said all standards have been coded by international yardsticks and there will be representations from all States and Union Territories on this commission with each state having state-level commissions."A common regulator has been prepared for all allied professions. This will enable a team-based approach to patient care," he said.The bill provides for regulation and maintenance of standards of education and services by allied and healthcare professionals, assessment of institutions, maintenance of a central and a state register and creation of a system to improve research and development and adoption of latest scientific advancement.The allied and healthcare professions include a wide range of workers for diagnosis, evaluation and treatment of acute and chronic diseases. These professions also work to optimise patient outcomes and attend to overall prevention, promotion, wellness and management of diseases.As per the statement of objects and the reasons of the bill, the advancement in the health sector, changing preferences of consumers and service providers, had warranted creation of a fresh vision of healthcare delivery with a patient-centric approach and focus on moving to a multi-disciplinary team-based care."This has necessitated the need to implement new ways of deploying health workers, strengthening the workforce by task-shifting models and improving access to quality services through qualified and competent allied and healthcare professionals," it added.Earlier in December 2018, the Allied and Healthcare Professions Bill, 2018, was introduced in the Rajya Sabha and the same was referred to the Department Related Parliamentary Standing Committee, which after a detailed examination recommended certain amendments.Therefore, it was withdrawn and a new bill called the National Commission for Allied and Healthcare Professions Bill incorporating the recommendations made by the panel, was introduced last year.A total of 110 recommendations were made by a parliamentary committee on it and the government accepted 102 while six recommendations were accepted with slight modifications. Only two recommendations were not incorporated.Participating in the debate, Congress member Balubhau Narayanrao Dhanorkar said his party supports the bill as allied healthcare workers are a key to providing treatment to the patients.He said the allied health workers have worked very hard, especially during the pandemic and deserve to be taken care of.Dhanorkar, however, said it is sad that the government does not have any figure about how many of these allied health workers passed away while fighting the pandemic.BJP member Subhash Bhamre said the bill reflected that the Narendra Modi government is dedicated to the service of the poor and through the bill the government wants to bring over 50 types of professionals under the regulatory network."The bill has the potential to bring path-breaking changes in the healthcare services. It is a landmark bill for the welfare of the allied healthcare professionals," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/healthcare-workers-bill-will-give-dignity-to-health-professionals-harsh-vardhan-101616574427902.html
24-03-2021||India||Maha Vikas Aghadi enjoys support of over 175 MLAs: NCP||Mumbai, Mar 24 (PTI) With the BJP questioning Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray's "silence" on various issues and asking the state Governor to seek a status report from the government, NCP leader Nawab Malik on Wednesday said the CM will speak at right time and that the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) has support of more than 175 MLAs.He also termed as "baseless" the BJP's allegations against the Shiv Sena-led government on several issues.Taking a swipe, Malik, who holds Minority Development portfolio, said leaders of BJP must understand that President's Rule cannot be imposed in a state "just like that".He claimed the MVA- comprising the Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress- has support of more than 175 MLAs.The state Assembly has 288 MLAs.Malik's reaction came after a BJP delegation met Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari on Wednesday morning and requested him to send a report on current situation in the state to President Ram Nath Kovind.Senior BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis, who led the delegation, questioned Thackeray's "silence" on various issues.The BJP has been targeting the Thackeray-led government over former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh's graft charges against state Home Minister Anil Deshmukh and also on a purported state intelligence department report on "corruption" in police transfers in Maharashtra."The chief minister will speak at the right time. He need not speak on every issue....He will speak at appropriate time. BJP's allegations are baseless," Malik told PTI.He said people of the state have started realizing that the BJP is involved in a conspiracy to defame the state government by peddling "half-baked information".The minister alleged the BJP has adopted a strategy through which it is trying to confuse people by claiming that the state government will not last long.Fadnavis on Tuesday claimed the MVA government did not act on an "incriminating" state intelligence department report containing audio intercepts of a "large scale corruption" in police transfers and postings, and sought a CBI probe into the episode.Malik on Wednesday reiterated that no due permission was sought to tap phones."The truth is that there is no substance in that report," Malik alleged.He said BJP leaders have been demanding imposition of President's Rule in the state since the last few days."However, the MVA has numbers stacked in its favour. There is a Supreme Court verdict that a government cannot be dissolved until it loses majority on the floor of the House," he said.Issuing a video statement, Malik said, "We (MVA) had support of 169 MLAs (when the government was formed). Now, we enjoy support of more than 175 MLAs. The BJP is restless, it cannot live without power. Hence, it is doing all these things". Malik added.He said the BJP's attempts to "destabilize" the government have failed."Earlier, the BJP said the government will not survive even for a month. Then it said the government won't last for three or six months. Then they said MLAs will break away. As the BJP failed not do anything, it is now bent on defaming the state government," Malik said and accused the BJP of using Central agencies to malign the image of the government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maha-vikas-aghadi-enjoys-support-of-over-175-mlas-ncp-101616572793883.html

The team picked up Polai on the basis of scientific and technological investigation and he confessed that he planned the loot with local criminals as he needed money desperately due to the financial crisis,” Ajay Linda, West Singhbhum superintendent of police (SP), said. The SP said Champua-based 30-year-old Md Salim and Saqib Javed along with 30-year-old Rajendra Laguri from Noamundi and Kripa Sindhu Patra alias Madan Patra from Keonjhar were arrested following Polai’s interrogation.“We have recovered ₹11, 84, 500 from the looted ₹15 lakh and the Pulsar motorcycle used in the crime and mobile phones. We will also seek departmental action against the branch manager of ICICI Bank Champua branch as he did not inform the police beforehand about his staff going to collect ₹15 lakh from a customer though he was bound to inform police about such collection above ₹10 lakh,” added Linda.Police said Polai claimed that he needed the money desperately for the treatment of his mother who he said is suffering from cancer.Salim and Saqib had looted ₹15 lakh from Polai and another bank employee Shib Sahu at Rangamati by firing in the air and escaped easily on a motorcycle on March 19 when Polai and Shib were returning to ICICI Bank Champua branch after collecting the money from bank customer Biswajit Kar, a businessman in Jaintgarh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bank-officer-who-allegedly-staged-rs-15-lakh-heist-arrested-in-jharkhand-101616571722694.html

24-03-2021||India||SC asks Param Bir Singh to approach Bombay HC with plea against Deshmukh||The Supreme Court on Wednesday asked former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh to approach the Bombay high court with his plea for a CBI probe against Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh for allegedly running a “money collection scheme” through the police department. A bench of justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and R Subhas Reddy noted in its order that the issue was “serious” since it related to administration at large, but added that the high court was a more appropriate forum for deciding the issue. The bench was emphatic that Singh should have approached the high court first since his request for a CBI probe could also be allowed by the high court. Senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, representing Singh, then opted to withdraw the petition and said he would approach the high court in the afternoon today, seeking a hearing on Thursday. On Rohatgi’s request, the court also included Deshmukh and National Investigation Agency (NIA) as parties to Singh’s petition. Singh, who was shunted out over the case of explosives being found in an abandoned SUV outside billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s residence, Antilia, and the subsequent arrest of suspended police officer Sachin Vaze in the case, had filed a writ petition in the top court on Monday. In his plea, Singh claimed that he was transferred to a low-key post in Mumbai Police’s Home Guards by an order on March 17 “immediately” after he brought the corrupt practices of Deshmukh to the knowledge of Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar and some other senior leaders in the state government. Also Read | ‘What did Param Bir Singh, Sachin Vaze discuss for 3 hours before arrest?’: NCP“The petitioner has invoked writ jurisdiction of this Hon’ble Court to seek unbiased, uninfluenced, impartial and fair investigation in the corrupt malpractices of Shri Anil Deshmukh, the Hon’ble Home Minister of Government of Maharashtra, before the evidence are destroyed,” said the petition, filed through advocate Abhinay. It contended that NCP leader Deshmukh held various meetings in February 2021 at his residence with police officers, including Sachin Vaze of Crime Intelligence Unit, Mumbai and Sanjay Patil, ACP (Social Service Branch), Mumbai, bypassing their seniors, and asked them to collect ₹100 crore every month from establishments such as bars, hookah parlours, restaurants. Singh also submitted that he was being made a “scapegoat to divert attention” from the Antilla case, highlighting that while there were vertically five officers between him and Vaze, Deshmukh was the one meeting Vaze at his residence. In that case, now being investigated by the NIA, Vaze has already been arrested. The state ATS has also named Vaze the main accused in the death of Mansukh Hiran who was in possession of the SUV found with the explosives, but reported it stolen a few days before the incident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-asks-param-bir-singh-to-approach-bombay-hc-with-plea-against-deshmukh-101616570702847.html

Bonds can be purchased only through cheque or DD, he said.Senior advocate Rakesh Dwivedi, who represented the Election Commission, said that the EC it is not opposed to these bonds but raised concerns over its anonymity.The petition has been filed by Association For Democratic Reforms (ADR) seeking to stop fresh sale of electoral bonds from April 1 till the top court decides on their validity.The NGO sought an urgent hearing stating that the sale of fresh electoral bonds should be stopped till the top court decides the three pending petitions challenging the electoral bond scheme 2018 which grants anonymity to donors of political parties.An electoral bond is an instrument in the nature of a promissory note or bearer bond which can be purchased by any individual, company, firm or association of persons provided the person or body is a citizen of India or incorporated or established in India. The bonds are issued specifically for the purpose of contributing of funds to political parties.In its PIL, the ADR had sought that the amendments carried out to the Finance Act be struck down. This lack of transparency in the accounts of all political parties was cited as the ground by ADR to oppose this scheme. These donations enjoy 100% tax exemption as they need not be reported to the Income Tax department either, the petition added.The electoral bond scheme was notified by the central government on January 2, 2018.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-reserves-order-on-electoral-bonds-but-expresses-concern-over-their-possible-101616569964442.html

But one of them bearing a red-green banner — lucknowkabadiwala.com – stands out from the rest.Owned by a 29-year-old civil engineer Om Prakash Prajapati, it is a start-up. He had launched it during lockdown, after quitting his job with a construction firm, where he was working as a civil engineer on a salary of ₹30,000 a month. The USP of this outlet is that it enables smart phone users to sell scrap online in a convenient way and at decent prices. “Never in my dreams I imagined that my idea of selling scrap online will get so much appreciation from people,” said Prajapati, who is the youngest in a family of five, including his parents and two brothers. “I first thought of coming up with an online scrap shop mobile application almost a year back when I observed a scrap dealer at a construction site in Varanasi, where I was working as a civil engineer. But that was just a dream and now I am surprised how this dream became a reality,” said Prajapati. He said the idea eventually took shape during lockdown when he decided to proceed with his start-up. But as it happens in most of the success stories, Prajapati too had to face lot of opposition from people within the family. “People, especially my relatives laughed at my idea and said who will marry a kabadiwala,” he recollected. But criticism did not deter him. In July 2020, Prajapati launched his office/cum warehouse and a mobile application ‘kabadiwala’ (scrap dealer). As the name suggests, kabadiwala is a scrap-dealing mobile application through which smart-phone users can sell scrap online. He said smartphone users can download the mobile application from Playstore. “Once downloaded, the mobile user can log in to the app that is pre fed with the list of scrap material and their prices. One can select the category of scrap to be sold and book an appointment. On the given time, our boys will go there and collect the scrap after paying the due amount,” he added. Once collected, the scrap is segregated and handed over to a recycler. “As there are no middlemen involved, we are offering the highest price for the scrap,” he added. Initially, the response was poor, but it improved gradually. “In eight months, our consumer database increased to around 9,000. On an average, we collect around 5 to 8 tonnes of scrap daily and earn around ₹50,000 to 60,000 monthly. The income often increases during festive seasons like Diwali,” he said. “They offer good prices. Newspapers at ₹14 a kg, aluminum at ₹80 per kg, battery ₹50-70 per kg and brass at ₹270 per kg and so on. The prices are comparatively higher as compared to what is offered by other scrap dealers. It’s an innovative approach that is also very convenient for people,” said Sudhakar Mishra, a private employee, who is a customer of the start-up||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lucknow-engineer-turns-kabadiwala-in-online-avatar-with-app-to-sell-scrap-101616568722524.html

However, the consumers is now looking for hygiene, sanitisation and safe travel and that is where organised players have done better than others.”“Overall, we have witnessed that bookings on all our pre-Covid operational routes are rising fast, especially on high-velocity routes like Delhi-Lucknow, Delhi-Amritsar, Bengaluru-Hyderabad, Bengaluru-Chennai, and Chennai-Madurai,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/more-people-making-domestic-trips-this-long-weekend-portal-101616567222692.html
24-03-2021||India||Heavy rain continues in Kashmir for third day, Jammu-Srinagar road remains shut||Heavy rain continued to lash Kashmir for the third consecutive day on Wednesday even as the India Meteorological Department (IMD) predicted improvement in the weather by late afternoon.The rainfall triggered landslides and mudslides on the Srinagar-Jammu national highway at more than 10 places which remained closed for the third day with hundreds of vehicles stranded at various places. Efforts are underway to clear the highway for traffic, officials said.“No vehicular movement shall be allowed from either side on Jammu-Srinagar highway in view of inclement weather prediction issued by MeT department,” a spokesman of the Jammu and Kashmir Traffic Police said. In Jammu, senior superintendent of police (traffic) national highway, JS Johar said that landslides at Cafeteria Morh, Digdol, Panthial, Shabanbass, Seri and Marog have blocked the highway in Ramban district.“Men and machinery have been pressed into service to clear the debris from affected stretches,” he said. Around 300 vehicles were stranded on the highway between Nashri and Chanderkote since Monday night but the traffic department and NHAI authorities worked overnight and the majority of the stranded vehicles in Ramban were cleared.“The weather has started improving and we hope to restore the affected stretches soon,” said Johar. The Mughal Road which is an alternate route to connect Kashmir with Jammu, was closed for traffic in December and is expected to be opened in the first week of April after completion of snow clearance operation. The Road connects Shopian in south Kashmir with Rajouri in Jammu. The upper reaches in Kashmir h slight snowfall that led to a fall in temperature. The continuous rain also led to water logging at many places and pushed up the water level of the Jhelum river and other big streams in south and north Kashmir.IMD officials in Srinagar said the upper reaches of Kashmir are witnessing fresh snowfall.“There will be significant decrease in the amount of rainfall today, but the system will prevail over Jammu and Kashmir till the evening,” a senior IMD official said.Schools in some areas of Kupwara district were closed for two days due to rain and snow.Srinagar recorded a maximum of 4.6 degrees Celsius during the night while Jammu recorded 15.9 degrees. Gulmarg was the coldest place in Kashmir as night temperature was recorded at minus 2.5 degrees.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/heavy-rain-continues-in-kashmir-for-third-day-jammu-srinagar-road-remains-shut-101616566326664.html

He looked forward to re-joining work at a private firm as the Covid-19 pandemic and the lockdown imposed to check its spread had forced Singh to return home in Jharkhand and left him without any source of income. A month later, Singh was shocked to learn that his employer’s generosity came at a price. The employer deducted ₹3,000 from his ₹10,000 salary as airfare reimbursement.Singh’s case is not isolated. The Jharkhand government’s labour department has prepared a report highlighting the plight of migrant workers like him who faced similar deductions--between ₹3,000 to ₹10,700--from their meagre salaries. HT has reviewed a draft of the report submitted to the Centre’s policy think tank Niti Aayog.Also Read | Covid-19 migrant crisis: How they returnedEmployers flying back migrant workers to return to work hit the headlines when economic activity restarted after the easing of the lockdown in the summer of 2020. India’s estimated 100 million migrants were among the hardest hit when the hard lockdown was imposed between last March and June. The lockdown triggered an exodus of hundreds of thousands of migrant workers from cities. A large number of them walked, cycled, and hitchhiked to return to their homes before special trains and buses were arranged for them. As many as 900,000 migrant workers returned to Jharkhand alone between March and July.Also Read | “There are endless stories of neglect, apathy, and exploitation in the destination cities and states,” said Jharkhand chief minister Hemant Soren.The labour department, which set up a 24-hour helpline, said it has been able to track at least 100 cases where employers made deductions for flying migrants back to their workplaces in Bengaluru, Mumbai and Chennai. “We have taken a serious note of these findings and contemplating how to take action,” said Soren.Singh said he had no choice but to return to Bengaluru. “I had to work. So, I do not feel so bad that they cut my plane fare,” he said. “I have parents and a young son. So, I was glad to go back. We did ask the contractor if he can find a way of helping us.”In Singh’s case, his employer partly subsidised his plane fare. But Mohammed Irshad had to repay the full amount--- ₹4,800-- spent on him to return to work at a garment factory in Mumbai.Irshad said it made sense for him to take the flight as a bus would have cost him ₹5,000 besides additional money for meals en route. “They [employers] have taken what we owed. If we did not work, then we would not have jobs... how would I then have fed my parents.”Jharkhand’s labour commissioner, Muthu Kumar, said the deductions amounted to a violation of the Payment of Wages Act, 1936. “We will write to all those employers for immediate action. It is inhuman that people were doing this during the lockdown. We see a clear violation of laws.”Zubair Ansari, another migrant worker from Jharkhand’s Palamu, hoped the government will reimburse their airfares. “Tickets were very expensive in June when I returned.”Johnson Topno, who worked for a helpline for migrant workers during the pandemic, said the employers have taken advantage of the vulnerabilities and distress of the migrants. “While the government is pursuing this, there is at the same time, a fear of losing one’s job, and that is too risky.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fare-deducted-from-pay-of-workers-who-flew-back-to-rejoin-work-j-khand-report-101616564702356.html
24-03-2021||India||For Navy, 6 nuclear-powered submarines take priority over 3rd aircraft carrier||The Indian Navy has informed the Narendra Modi government that the induction of six nuclear-powered submarines would take priority over a third heavy aircraft carrier discussed earlier to counter the rapid expansion of the People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) and dominate the Indian Ocean, people familiar with the matter said.According to South Block officials, the Indian Navy told the country’s national security planners at the Combined Commanders Conference this month that the plan to build the nuclear-powered attack submarines or SSNs should take priority over the project to build a third aircraft carrier (also called indigenous aircraft carrier 2). It is understood that the Navy will seek “acceptance of necessity” or AON approval from the government on the submarine project soon as China has developed the capacity to produce 12,000-tonne Renhai class destroyers in just five years.While even Pakistan’s Agosta 90B submarine, the only one of the five that are operational, can make its way to the Bay of Bengal with an intrepid crew, the SSN class of submarines, carrying a conventional missile and weapon systems, is only limited in range by food supplies.The nuclear-powered submarines can patrol the entire Indo-Pacific without even surfacing once and remain detected on high seas and equatorial waters. China has nearly a dozen such submarines in operation. Its latest, the Type 095 attack submarine has a reduced acoustic signature as compared to the Han class of submarines.While India has a number of options to jointly design and develop the submarines with countries such as Russia, France and the US under the Atma Nirbhar Bharat rubric, India’s preferred partner appears to be Paris as it is already designed Kalvari class of diesel attack submarines for Indian Navy and is currently jointly developing a nuclear attack submarine (named Alvaro Alberto) for Brazil under a strategic partnership.Apart from being India’s closest allies in defence technology, joint development of submarines with France is free from any regulatory regimes such as the International Traffic in Arms Regulation (ITAR) with the US or any future sanctions in case of Russia. India already operates one Akula class SSN from Russia on lease with an agreement to get another one when the lease on the first expires.The government’s emphasis on upgrading naval assets is an attempt to counter China’s navy in the Indian Ocean and beyond. The PLA’s navy is larger than the US navy in terms of the number of ships, although the US is still ahead in terms of tonnage and capability.It is in this context that the Navy is also seriously thinking of reviving its heavy-destroyer project to counter the 12,000-tonne cruisers being built by China. The first of India’s 7,500 tonne INS Visakhapatnam class of guided-missile destroyers is expected to be commissioned within a year.Indian national security planners believe that the next threat from China will come on Indo-Pacific, particularly in the Indian Ocean with the US Navy continuously deployed in the South China Sea and ensuring that the PLAN ballistic missile submarines do not cross the first island chain. This means that PLAN will have to take a circuitous route to deploy its nuclear submarines in the Indian Ocean as it is mandatory for sub-surface vessels to surface when they cross Malacca Straits, Sunda or Lombok straits.As part of India’s effort to match China, India will commission its second aircraft carrier INS Vikrant - it is New Delhi’s first indigenously-built aircraft carrier - later this year. It will be home-based on the eastern seaboard while INS Vikramaditya, the other carrier built by Russia, will be on the western seaboard of India. INS Arighat, the second nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarine (SSBN) will also be commissioned this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/for-navy-6-nuclear-powered-submarines-take-priority-over-3rd-aircraft-carrier-101616564522467.html

Aquilino also commended India's efforts to protect its northern border during a months-long standoff with China."The mistrust between China and India is at an all-time high. In addition to the rupture of bilateral relations as a result of the LAC (Line of Actual Control) skirmish, India is deeply suspicious of Chinese activities as part of the 'One Belt, One Road' initiative," Aquilino told members of the Senate Armed Services Committee on Tuesday during the confirmation hearing for commander, US Indo-Pacific Command."China's posture initiatives in both Gwadar, Pakistan, and Hambantota, Sri Lanka, also cause India concern. As is the case across the Indo-Pacific, PRC's lack of transparency and duplicitous actions in the Indian Ocean region threaten stability and security in the region," he said in a written response to a set of questions from Senators for the confirmation hearing.Replying to a question from Senator Deb Fischer about China's actions along India's borders and the future of the India-US military cooperation, Aquilino commended the work done by India to protect its northern border. He also highlighted the need for cooperation and working with allies and partners to build deterrence.Aquilino said the US-India military relationship is at its best level in years, and the United States continues to experience growth in both bilateral and multilateral engagements and exercises, high-profile joint operations, and an increased number of senior level engagements.Recent operations by the Chinese have helped highlight the threat China's actions pose to all nations, including India. "The conclusion of enabling agreements over the past several years has allowed us to operate more closely, and we are able to work together more than ever before to secure a free and open Indo-Pacific," he said.If confirmed, the top US admiral said, his priorities would be to maintain the momentum that has been generated by his predecessor and build information sharing and security agreements, support India's defence transformation efforts through exchanges and exercises, continue to encourage India's acquisition of US equipment to promote interoperability, and increase military-to-military contacts throughout standing dialogues, senior leader contacts, and working-level exchanges.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mistrust-between-china-india-at-all-time-high-says-us-admiral-101616562411618.html

"CM Uddhav Thackeray has maintained silence on the entire political crisis. We have requested Governor to make him speak and seek a report from him," said the former chief minister.The BJP has been attacking the three-party ruling Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) alliance over the allegations against state home minister Anil Deshmukh, demanding his resignation. The NCP leader has been accused of corruption by Param Bir Singh, an IPS officer who was transferred as Mumbai police commissioner during the investigation into security threat case against billionaire Mukesh Ambani.Singh said in a letter to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray that Deshmukh gave Assistant Police Inspector Sachin Vaze, arrested in the Ambani bomb scare case, a target to extort ₹100 crore from various establishments of Mumbai. Singh has moved the Supreme Court against his transfer and to seek a CBI probe against Deshmukh. The court will hear the petition today. The minister has, meanwhile, denied all the charges.Also Read: MVA may announce probe in Vaze-Deshmukh row todayThe NCP, part of MVA, has also backed the minister, ruling out his resignation. NCP chief Sharad Pawar - credited with stitching the three-party alliance of Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress - acting as the chief crisis manager, held a press conference and multiple meetings with party leaders and discussed the issue. He told reporters on Monday that Deshmukh was recuperating from Covid-19 during the period Param Bir Singh has claimed that he was indulging in "extortion activities" through police officers.But Fadnavis took a jibe at the senior politician from Maharashtra over the statement. "Deshmukh was in home quarantine from February 15-27 but met officers and was not in isolation. I feel Pawar Sahab was not briefed properly yesterday," the BJP leader said.Fadnavis claimed the Maha Vikas Agadi (MVA) government in the state did not act on a state intelligence department report containing audio intercepts of "large scale corruption" in police transfers and postings, and said he would seek a probe by the CBI.The BJP leader met the Union home secretary in Delhi on Tuesday and submitted all the evidence. "The Union home secretary told me that they will verify documents and evidence submitted and a report will be sent to the Central government, which will take appropriate action," Fadnavis told reporters after the meeting.However, Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut said that there is nothing serious in the documents Fadnavis gave to the home secretary. "The government will not come under threat with it," he added.Meanwhile, amid the calls for his resignation, Deshmukh met Thackeray at the latter's residence 'Varsha' in Mumbai on Tuesday. Maharashtra Cabinet is scheduled to hold a meeting on Wednesday in Mumbai and is likely to discuss the issue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fadnavis-meets-maharashtra-governor-amid-row-over-anil-deshmukh-101616560502174.html

Here is all you need to know about its impact:• It is likely to result in harsh summer as La Niña is associated with the cooling of Pacific waters. • A La Niña year generally receives good rainfall and temperatures are lower than normal.• La Niña has started weakening after being at its peak in January and February. • It is often associated with lower temperatures in India. • But that is now unlikely during the rest of the summer and monsoon months. • The actual weather conditions will depend on local synoptic features.Also Read | Early onset of summer in NW India despite La Niña’s cooling effect?• The interaction of westerlies and easterlies over central India is currently causing thunderstorm activity and temperatures have dropped. But overall, La Niña will phase out gradually.• IMD’s monsoon mission coupled forecasting system has indicated the likely warming of sea surface temperatures (SSTs) over the central and eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean in April and May, which indicates a transition of La Niña condition to El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO)-neutral condition. • This means neither El Niño nor La Niña. • El Niño is a warming of the ocean surface or above-average sea surface temperatures.• There is also a high probability that La Niña will re-emerge after or during the monsoon, according to IMD. • The weakening of La Niña conditions indicates a harsh summer is likely. • There is a 60% probability of ENSO-neutral conditions in April.• There is no chance of El Niño which makes summer even harsher in India. • Monsoon is likely to be also normal this year. • La Niña is expected to re-emerge after the monsoon so it may remain moderate during the upcoming winter.• ENSO is a periodic fluctuation in sea surface temperatures and the air pressure of the overlying atmosphere across the equatorial Pacific Ocean. • It has a major influence on weather and climate patterns such as heavy rains, floods, and drought. • El Niño has a warming influence on global temperatures, while La Niña has the opposite effect. • In India, El Niño is associated with drought or weak monsoon, while La Niña is associated with strong monsoon and above average rains and colder winters.• This winter was the third warmest since 1901 when IMD began keeping records. • It was also the second warmest in the past 120 years when minimum or early morning temperatures were considered.

24-03-2021||India||NIA files charge sheet against organisation claiming Manipur’s freedom from India||The National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Tuesday filed a charge sheet against five persons in its probe related to formation of a self-styled organisation which declared Manipur’s independence from India and collected funds for its illegal activities. Those named in the charge sheet are: Narengbam Samarjit Singh, Yambem Biren, Narengbam Biswajit Singh, Elangbam Brojendro Singh, and Akoijam Deepa Anand. Officials said that the five have been charged under the Indian Penal Code and the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. The charge sheet was filed before a special NIA court in Imphal, Manipur.According to NIA spokesperson Jaya Roy, this case pertains to the formation of Manipur State Council in London on October 29, 2019. Self-styled external affairs and defence minister of said council, Narengbam Samarjit Singh, and its chief minister, Yambem Biren, then declared Manipur independent of the Union of India.“Investigation has revealed that Narengbam Samarjit Singh was the chairman and managing director of Salai Group of Companies and SMART Society. He, along with his associates Elangbam Brojendro Singh and Akoijam Deepa Anand, illegally collected huge amounts of money by inviting deposits to his companies with the promise of 36% annual returns,” said Roy. “These illegal funds were laundered by Singh and his associates through various companies of the Salai Group of Companies/SMART Society. The illegitimate funds were utilised for unlawful activities like declaration of independence of Manipur from the Union of India and the formation of Manipur State Council at London and also for funding the army of the Manipur State Council,” she added. The agency didn’t share further details on accused persons.

24-03-2021||India||Supreme Court to hear today petition seeking stay on fresh sale of electoral bonds ahead of Assembly polls||The Supreme Court will on Wednesday hear plea of a non-governmental organisation seeking a stay on the sale of fresh electoral bonds ahead of state assembly elections in West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Assam and the union territory of Puducherry.The petition has been filed by Association For Democratic Reforms (ADR) seeking to stop fresh sale of electoral bonds from April 1 till the top court decides on their validity.The petition will be heard by a bench headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde.Advocate Prashant Bhushan, representing the ADR, last week mentioned the matter before the bench, which also included justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian, for an urgent listing of the case.The plea of the NGO sought an urgent hearing stating that the sale of fresh electoral bonds should be stopped till the top court decides the three pending petitions challenging the electoral bond scheme 2018 which grants anonymity to donors of political parties."There is a serious apprehension that any further sale of Electoral Bonds before the upcoming state elections in West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Assam, would further increase illegal and illicit funding of political parties through shell companies. Thus, the petitioner seeks a direction that no further opening of the window for the sale of electoral bonds be allowed during the pendency of the instant writ petition," the petition stated.The Petitioner-NGO in it is application stated that previously, on two occasions, the government opened a special sale window of electoral bonds right before the State assembly elections, and so far more than ₹6500 crores worth of electoral bonds have been sold with the majority of donations going to the ruling party.An electoral bond is an instrument in the nature of a promissory note or bearer bond which can be purchased by any individual, company, firm or association of persons provided the person or body is a citizen of India or incorporated or established in India. The bonds are issued specifically for the purpose of contributing of funds to political parties.In its PIL, the ADR had sought that the amendments carried out to the Finance Act be struck down. This lack of transparency in the accounts of all political parties was cited as the ground by ADR to oppose this scheme. These donations enjoy 100% tax exemption as they need not be reported to the Income Tax department either, the petition added.The electoral bond scheme was notified by the central government on January 2, 2018.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-to-hear-plea-seeking-stay-on-fresh-sale-of-electoral-bonds-ahead-of-assembly-polls-101616555938131.html

RT-PCR testing levels must be increased as per the targets communicated to districts. For all positive cases, contact tracing must be done and the guideline of Test-Track-Treat be followed,” the government order said.It also said that wherever a cluster of cases is detected, mini-containment zones can be set up.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/as-covid-cases-rise-odisha-caps-marriage-gatherings-at-200-funeral-at-50-101616556002089.html

It also recorded 132 deaths, taking the toll to 53,589.Mumbai also recorded 3,514 cases and eight fatalities, taking the tally to 369,451 and the toll to 11,604. There are 230,641 active cases in the state, while the positivity rate is 13.63%.However, despite the surge in cases, experts are not recommending a lockdown since the economy is limping back to normal. Instead, they say the state should start vaccinations for everyone above 18, and the public must follow the Covid-19 protocol to contain the spread of the infection.Dr Rahul Pandit, who is part of the state’s Covid-19 task force, said, “No one wants the economy to be hampered again due to a lockdown. But curbs can be put on non-essential activities, such as morning and evening walks, and on those who leave homes just for an outing in the parks or beaches. This will not affect any businesses or those dependent on such businesses for their day-to-day income.”Meanwhile, the state has issued guidelines regarding celebration of Shab-e-Barat this weekend, asking organisers to hold the event online. If the religious congregation is being performed in the mosque, appropriate measures must be taken to sanitise, social distancing must be maintained and everyone should be wearing masks, the state government said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-reports-28-699-fresh-covid-cases-132-deaths-101616555281674.html
24-03-2021||India||Odisha sends back tigress from Satkosia reserve to Madhya Pradesh||The much-vaunted inter-state tiger translocation drive ended in a whimper after Sundari, the four-and-half year-old tigress relocated from Madhya Pradesh in 2018 to Satkoisa tiger reserve in Odisha’s Angul district was sent back to the Kanha reserve in Madhya Pradesh on Tuesday evening.Angul Regional Chief Conservator of Forest Pradeep Raj Karat said the 160-kg tigress was tranquilised after several attempts to put it in a cage ended in failure. “After a tranquilising shot was given to the tigress, she took 15 minutes to lose consciousness. The forest personnel then brought her into a cage,” said Karat. The RCCF said.The tigress was then loaded in a special vehicle brought in by a team from Kanha National Park. The tigress would reach Ghorela rewilding centre of Kanha National park on Wednesday afternoon.In June 2018, Sundari was brought to Satkosia tiger reserve of Angul district from Bandhavgarh tiger reserve of Madhya Pradesh under country’s first interstate relocation exercise for tigers. Mahabir, another tiger from Madhya Pradesh which was brought in the same month as part of state government’s plan to repopulate Satkosia tiger reserve, died a few months later after being caught in metal snares laid by poachers. Sundari too was shifted to a special enclosure in Satkosia tiger reserve after it killed a 45-year-old woman and a 65-year-old man living inside the reserve in September 2018, triggering violence by locals who burnt the forest department’s boats and beat house.The ₹19-crore ambitious tiger relocation exercise conceived by the Union ministry of environment and forests, National Tiger Conservation Authority and Wildlife Institute of India was started in June 2018 under the project of “augmentation and recovery of tiger population in Satkosia tiger reserve”. Six tigers (three pairs) from different reserves of Madhya Pradesh were to be sent to Odisha under the project. The NTCA spent ₹8 crore for translocation of Sundari and Mahabir.However, after the death of Mahabir and captivity of Sundari, the National Tiger Conservation Authority in December 2019 had asked Odisha government to send back Sundari from Satkosia accusing the Odisha forest and wildlife department of making a mess out of the monitoring and management of the relocated tigress. NTCA said Sundari was not monitored and managed as per the standard operating procedure set by it.Expressing dismay over the lack of preparation for the reintroduction of tigers in Satkosia reserve, the NTCA said the Odisha forest and wildlife department could not take steps for prey augmentation, creation of inviolate space, ecodevelopment, capacity building of staff and enhancement of protection in spite of availability of sufficient funds and technical support.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-sends-back-tigress-from-satkosia-reserve-to-madhya-pradesh-101616554861730.html

24-03-2021||India||One year of lockdown: How country was halted due to Covid-19||On March 23 last year, the Centre announced the strictest measure in the wake of Covid-19 pandemic which had just started to ravage the country. India, said Prime Minister Narendra Modi, will be put under a "lockdown" from the next day. Explaining what it means, PM Modi said it will be more stringent than the one-day Janta Curfew announced on March 22, 2020. "Stay wherever you are," the Prime Minister announced in a special address to the nation.Lockdown meant the entire country stopped. Offices were closed, transport services halted and flights grounded. The unprecedented measure sought to break the chain of infection and stop the further spread of the coronavirus disease.Also Read | Covid curbs changed the way India livesWednesday marks the first anniversary of the lockdown, which saw multiple extensions and eventually ended with a phased unlocking.

24-03-2021||India||Param Bir Singh's plea challenging his transfer, seeking CBI probe against Deshmukh in SC today||The Supreme Court (SC) on Wednesday will hear former Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh's petition seeking a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) into allegations levelled by him against Maharashtra Home Minister Anil Deshmukh.Singh, ousted in connection with the Ambani security scare and the arrest of police officer Sachin Vaze that followed, has accused Deshmukh of running a 'money collection scheme' through the police department.A two-judge bench, comprising Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and R Subhash Reddy, will hear the plea in which the senior police officer also seeks a stay on his transfer to a low-key post in Maharashtra Police’s Home Guards.Singh claims that immediately after he accused the state home minister of corruption in front of Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar and some other senior leaders, he was transferred.“The petitioner has invoked writ jurisdiction of this Hon’ble Court to seek unbiased, uninfluenced, impartial and fair investigation in the corrupt malpractices of Shri Anil Deshmukh, the Hon’ble Home Minister of Government of Maharashtra, before the evidence are destroyed,” said Singh's petition, filed through advocate Abhinay.According to Singh, in February 2021, Deshmukh tasked police officers, including Sachin Vaze, with collecting ₹100 crore every month from bars, hookah parlours, restaurants etc. He also contended that he was being made a “scapegoat to divert attention” in the Ambani security scare case. Even though there were five officers ranked between him and Vaze, Deshmukh used to meet Vaze at his residence, he said.Vaze has been arrested by the National Investigation Agency (NIA), which is investigating the Ambani security scare probe, and has also been named prime accused in the death of Mansukh Hiran, who was linked with the SUV found with the explosives in front of the Ambani's residence Antilia in Mumbai.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/param-bir-singh-s-plea-challenging-his-transfer-seeking-cbi-probe-against-deshmukh-in-sc-today-101616549486682.html
24-03-2021||India||Playing to no audience: How arts and culture survived the pandemic||“It felt weird,” said 37-year-old Kolkata-based guitarist Bodhisattwa Ghosh, talking about the first time he stood in front of a live audience nine months after the lockdown was first announced in March 2020 to curb the spread of the coronavirus disease. It was at the Bengal Music Fair, organised in South Kolkata’s Deshapriya Park in the last week of December, and Ghosh remembers it being a fairly clinical affair: each band had separate cubicles, and none lingered on stage to interact with the audience – most of who were in masks – after its performance. His own, a vernacular contemporary rock band, Lakkhichhara, played its set and left shortly afterwards. Still, it was better than playing to no audience at all, Ghosh said.The lockdown months were not fallow as they forced Ghosh and other members of his band – he is also part of The Bodhisattwa Trio, a jazz fusion band – to come up with ways of working remotely. In August, the Trio released a single, Europa Swim, though the members were in different cities: pianist Arunava Chatterjee (Shonai) in Delhi, drummer Premjit Datta and Ghosh in Kolkata. “We kept making new stuff and sending new compositions to Shonai. For the single we released in August, we recorded our parts individually in our respective places. That’s very unusual for a jazz band where we record live what we’re playing, together, in the moment,” Ghosh said. The Trio live streamed a performance from popular Kolkata jazz club Skinny Mo’s in June. It was a ticketed event but the audience heard them in a closed group on Facebook.If the timbre of performances changed in 2020, several performers were also forced to rethink the relevance of their art form as they explored digital avenues from Instagram live videos to Zoom calls. New technology came up that allowed people to watch live performances with friends, and make decisions on the video calling application. For some it worked:British singerDua Lipa broke online live stream records with her lavish Studio 2054 show, pulling in more than five million views. For several others, it wasn’t that easy. Several artistes were also forced to deal with a more precarious future as the lockdown led to cancellations of shows across the country.The big shift for 32-year-old harmonium player Zakir Dhaulpuri was turning to the web to continue to impart lessons to his students. The New Delhi-based accompanist learnt to play the instrument from his father, the famed late harmonium player Mehmood Dhaulpuri who accompanied vocalists such as Kishori Amonkar and Bhimsen Joshi. But to go on Zoom, Dhaulpuri took the help of his 22-year-old nephew, a student of Delhi University and a tabla player. In the online class, it was not difficult to teach the students where they were going wrong with the note, or how they needed to improve their technique, Dhaulpuri said. “It was good to learn something new. At least the children were occupied. But music is a prayer (ibadat) and children need to learn it, and experiment with it, in your physical presence,” he said.Theatre and film actor Danish Husain, famous for his Dastangoi performances, was in the US to give a performance and a lecture in March (both got cancelled), and was stranded there till July. “I began to wonder that if the pandemic goes on for three or four years and shoots don’t resume or theatres don’t open and I am never able to perform again, what would I do to reinvent myself,” he said.Husain, who most recently appeared in the Netflix series Bombay Begums, produced a series of 20 Instagram videos titled, A Dastango stranded in America, starting March 2020. “I had a lovely view from my room in my sister’s house. I love reciting poetry. So why not memorise poems and have a series of videos, I thought? In a conversation, friends suggested that I use the window blinds as a stage curtain,” he said.“I was not used to performing to my phone. Instead of going to a stage, we now went into a Zoom call and saw audience there. Just like theatre to film, this was a new medium for me. I needed to adjust the grammar of my performance to adjust to this medium.”The shift to the digital medium also required investment, Hindustani classical singer Shubha Mudgal pointed out. Through the lockdown, Mudgal performed in digital concerts, participated in online conversations on the arts, and even gave master classes online.“The realisation that I would have to equip myself for a long period of online events also meant investing in some semi-professional equipment for such activities. But by then, every mike, every piece of live streaming equipment that one could buy for this purpose was either unavailable, or was selling at hugely escalated prices. And by that I mean, that the prices had gone up, in some cases, by 200% or even more. Eventually, I did buy some equipment and asked colleagues and even young students to teach me how to use a sound interface. That’s how I have managed all this while, as have so many artistes. We have survived by sheer dint of our ability to adapt and move ahead,” she said.Dhaulpuri also gave two concerts online, which were streamed live on Facebook: he played from his home, street sounds notwithstanding. “These are not things you can do much about,” he said.Theatre actor and radio jockey Roshan Abbas, who co-founded arts collective Kommune, said that the “pivot” to the digital space was necessary if artists had any chance of surviving the lockdown months. Together with his team, he produced a digital play Lockdown Love ,directed by Sheena Khalid, where various actors enacted their parts over Zoom in a play that was, helpfully, about online dating. It was a ticketed event and gave Abbas an insight into how the digital space could be monetised for performances. The team at Kommune held several events over the lockdown months, trying everything from learning workshops to midnight podcasts (for the insomniacs, “a big hit”, Abbas said) and even a mehfil of Urdu poetry on August 15.“Instead of a stage manager, what we needed was a Zoom manager who knows when to cut and switch screens and a sound manager who could manage mics on the platform. It was like internet 1.0, and what we were telling performers is that technology needn’t scare you,” Abbas said.Through the lockdown, efforts were made to monetise the digital medium: the Indian Singers’ Rights Association set up a series of virtual concerts, and the funds collected went to the PM-Cares fund to help people affected by the pandemic. Together with arts consultant Rashmi Dhanwani, entrepreneur Megha Desai, lawyer Priyanka Khimani, and marketing professional Gaurav Wadhwa, Abbas helped set up StayInALive, a platform where artists’ performances contributed to a fund for those struggling under the lockdown.A report brought out by online arts repository, Sahapedia, quoted budgetary figures over the past five years to show how arts and culture in the country needed enhanced funding; the lockdown only augmented the economic crunch the industry finds itself in. When asked about the budget slash, a culture ministry spokesperson refused to comment.The Bodhisattwa Trio saw their earnings slashed by almost a fifth compared to 2019, which, Ghosh said, was a highly successful year for them. The band toured Europe and several Indian cities, performed in jazz venues like Blue Note in Poland and B Flat in Berlin, and released an album with a Croatian label. The Trio was well on its way to release its fourth album when the lockdown was imposed. The concerts that they had lined up for 2020, including one in the Jaiyede jazz festival in Denmark, were cancelled.However, as things return to normal, the rising number of Covid cases in the country remains a concern. Last month, Dhaulpuri gave his first paid performance -- a stage performance in Bhopal – after almost a year since the lockdown was imposed. He had two performances in March.As for his students, he now takes the classes with them in another flat that is not too far from his home. The students sanitise their hands before they sit down. They keep their masks on when they play the harmonium.According to Abbas, the pandemic taught performers to collaborate and think beyond physical performances. Online performances aren’t going anywhere, he said. “Like concerts have directors for DTH specials, so will live performances.

The car has been sent for analysis by the Forensic Science Laboratory in Mumbai.The Maharashtra ATS late on Saturday also arrested two persons who were previously detained in connection with the case and has recorded the statements of at least 25 people.The arrested have been identified as a Mumbai Police constable Vinayak Shinde and a bookie Naresh Dhare.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mansukh-hiran-death-maha-ats-yet-to-hand-over-documents-to-nia-despite-mha-orders-101616546663673.html

The improvised explosive device (IED) blast took place between Kanhargaon and Kadenar villages under Dhaudai police station limits, they added.“The incident has also left 14 security personnel injured, including two critically, who were airlifted to Raipur,” said director general of police (Chhattisgarh) DM Awasthi. The bus carrying the personnel was passing through the under-construction Barsoor-Palli road, which is surrounded by the dense forest of Abhujmad, when the Maoists triggered a landmine blast near a culvert.The impact was such that the bus fell off the culvert, he said.Chhattisgarh chief minister Bhupesh Baghel condemned the incident. “We will increase anti-Maoist operations in the region,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/5-jawans-killed-in-bastar-ied-blast-101616544760799.html
24-03-2021||India||One year of lockdown: Unlocked, and holding on to hope||On March 24, 2020, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced a countrywide lockdown, starting at midnight, to contain the spread of Covid-19. The decision followed a 14-hour voluntary “janata curfew” (public curfew) on March 22.Till then, India had reported 536 infections. “There is absolutely no need to panic,” PM Modi said at the time, initially announcing a shutdown for three weeks. But a continuous surge in cases forced the Centre to extend restrictions several times, eventually extending the hard lockdown to 68 days.In addition to restrictions on movement of people, the lockdown halted all transport services — road, air and rail — with exceptions for transportation of essential goods, fire, police and emergency services. Essential services such as grocery shops, banks and ATMs, petrol pumps, among others, remained open, but the streets fell silent in a manner they had never before.By June 1, when the country had over 198,000 infections, the Centre announced a phased easing of restrictions — bringing life back to some regions. After a gap of over two months, the Indian Railways, too, announced that it was resuming operations of nearly 100 trains.Domestic flight services were resumed a little earlier, on May 25.A year later, the country is now facing a second wave of Covid-19 infections, with worst-hit states such as Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Gujarat imposing district-level partial lockdowns and restrictions.On Tuesday, India registered 47,239 new Covid-19 cases and 276 fatalities, which have taken the country’s cumulative tally to 11,733,595 and the toll to 160,497, according to the Union health ministry data.Faced with an unprecedented situation and prevailing uncertainty, here’s how the Capital’s heart stopped beating, and then slowly stuttered back to life, even as normalcy is a fair distance away.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/one-year-of-lockdown-unlocked-and-holding-on-to-hope-101616542986285.html
24-03-2021||India||Covid-19 migrant crisis: How they returned||Millions of labourers spilled out of India’s cities in a desperate attempt to reach home during the lockdown. Their plight holds important takeaways for the country’s policymakers and development strategistsWALKING OR CYCLINGRoughly a week after the lockdown was imposed, workers started appearing on highways, bags slung on their backs, a bundle on their heads and children cradled in one arm. The most famous examples of this were Odisha resident Mahesh Jena, who pedalled 1,700km to get home, and Jyoti Kumari, who cycled with her ailing father in tow, from Gurugram to Darbhanga.BY BUSRemember the thousands-strong crowd at Delhi’s Anand Vihar bus terminus in the last week of March? Desperate migrant workers jostled with each other to get back home, often spending nights on the road so that they didn’t lose their place in the queue and eating only a small packet of biscuits. After a few days, some states organised buses to take them home.BY TRAINThe Centre started Shramik Special trains on May 1. Many of them ran from western states to northern and eastern India. Overall, 4,621 trains carried 6.3 million passengers between May 1 and August 31. The trains also ran into rows, first over fares, then delays and finally about poor facilities, especially when the image of a child trying to wake up his dead mother in Bihar went viral. The government denied the charges.BY FLIGHTStuck for months, some workers reached their home states after students and activists raised funds to charter flights. The first such flight took workers from Mumbai to Ranchi in the last week of May; after that, similar flights were funded by student groups, actors, activists and NGOs, though the overall numbers remained small.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-migrant-crisis-how-they-returned-101616542346065.html

However, we have grave concerns regarding the rules, which can fundamentally alter how news publishers operate over the Internet and undermine the freedom of the press,” the EGI said in a letter to Prime Minister Modi.

24-03-2021||India||HT Interview: ‘BJP provided road map for Sonar Bangla,' says Amit Shah||It might not be incorrect to say that West Bengal has been on Union home minister Amit Shah’s mind for a long time. Indeed, at the peak of the campaign in the Bihar assembly elections, Shah landed up in the state (as he has been doing regularly for several years), where his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has become a significant political force in the past decade. Not surprisingly, in the coming round of assembly elections to four states and a Union territory, Shah’s primary focus has been West Bengal.Shah has set the party the target of winning 200-plus of the 294 assembly seats in the state. In an interview to HT, he said anyone sceptical of this claim need only look at the party’s performance in the 2019 general elections when the party improved its tally from two MPs to 18 and nearly equalled the Trinamool Congress’s (TMC’s) vote share.While the TMC’s campaign centres around “Bengal Ki Beti” Mamata Banerjee versus an outside force, the BJP, Shah asserts that the people of West Bengal are rooting for a change.Shah sees the BJP winning Assam and West Bengal, the BJP-AIADMK alliance winning Tamil Nadu, and the party improving its seat share in Kerala and Puducherry. Edited excerpts:There is an accusation that the BJP has polarised the elections in West Bengal on religious lines. There is also a charge that it lacks a narrative.If giving voice to issues that matter to the people of West Bengal is seen as religious polarisation, then it’s a new definition of polarisation I have come across. We say there should be unfettered celebrations for Durga Puja; why should anyone object to it? So why did they [TMC] stop it? Why was Saraswati Puja stopped? Wasn’t that religious polarisation? The BJP has not said a word against any religious celebration; we do not have any objection to anyone observing Ramzan or holding Christmas celebrations.As for the lack of narrative in Bengal, the Opposition may have nothing to say, but we have provided a road map for Sonar Bangla (golden Bengal).You have stated that the BJP will get 200-plus seats in West Bengal. What makes you so sure of achieving that target?The people of West Bengal have accepted the vision for the state’s development that has been put forth by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.The BJP’s performance in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections in the state, when it won 18 seats, needs to be studied to understand how we came up with the number of 200-plus. If you juxtapose the performance of the BJP in the last Lok Sabha with the assemblies, you will get the drift of how we have arrived at that figure.After winning 18 seats, the confidence has gone up that the BJP can win. And the party already has strengthened its presence on the ground, and in 85% of the booths, our organisation and booth infrastructure is in place. There has also been an erosion in the TMC camp; so many of their leaders have left.Women voters have emerged as a crucial constituency in all elections. There seems to be a tussle between the BJP and the TMC for their votes.We are not fighting for their votes; the women are already with us. There are a few states in the country where women are the worst-affected because of the state government’s apathy, and West Bengal is one of them. Besides lack of opportunities, women in West Bengal have been subjected to violence by the TMC cadre, and the state tops the charts in as far as crimes against women are concerned. We have promised job reservation for women in the state because they were 100% ignored (by the previous government). There is a huge gap which needs to be bridged. Moreover, women have been at the centre of the Modi government’s schemes in the last six-and-a-half years. And once the BJP comes to power in West Bengal, the double-engine BJP government (at the Centre and at the state) will ensure that women in state get all the benefits of the women-centric policies of the Modi government.The conversation around the implementation of CAA is intriguing. It is panning out differently in Assam and West Bengal?All I will say is that CAA is a central law.The Congress has stated multiple times during its election campaigns in various states, including most recently in Assam and West Bengal, that it will not allow the implementation of CAA?The Congress needs to be asked to spell out its policy clearly. They have been saying they will not implement CAA, but why are they not saying that they won’t implement NRC (National Register of Citizens) as well? Rahul Gandhi should tell people of Assam what his party’s policy is about NRC.How does the BJP perceive the Opposition’s alliance in Assam?The Congress will be pulled down by [aligning with] Badruddin Ajmal (of the AIUDF). The people of Assam are tired of terrorism, illegal infiltration, and protests. By staying with Ajmal, you ( Congress) cannot ensure an end to any of these problems. There was a time in Assam when protests, killings and curfews were common; we managed to change all that. The state has been set on the path of development.The Opposition’s alliance has been forged anticipating our victory. Under the leadership of Prime Minister Modi, we’re promising an andolan (protest), atankwad (terrorism), ghuspaith (intrusion) and now a baad (flood)-mukt (free) Assam.In West Bengal, too, there is an alliance of the opposition parties. The Congress is aligning with the ISF there.I cannot understand the Congress — in Assam they are aligning with the AIDUF, in Kerala with the Indian Union Muslim League, and in West Bengal with the Pirzada of Furfura (Abbas Siddiqui’s ISF). What kind of a secular party is this?What are the issues on which the BJP is seeking re-election in Assam. How is it poised to take on the Congress alliance?There is nothing left for them here. We will win with a comfortable majority. In Bodoland, for instance, more than 5,000 people were killed when the Congress was in power; in the last five years, after we signed the Bodo settlement agreement, more than 2,000 extremists laid down arms and agreed to join the mainstream. We will also work out a rehabilitation programme for them.In the past five years, our government has undertaken several initiatives that did not happen in the last 60 years, such as building five bridges over the Brahmaputra, laying out a network of over 20,000km of roads, and building hospitals including a cancer hospital in PPP model. After a long time, there has been no curfew for over 7-8 days, and this is a big achievement.It was the BJP government that gave Bharat Ratna (highest civilian honour) to Bhupen Hazarika and rid the jungles of Kaziranga of illegal encroachment. The people of this state recognise this, and we will win with a better majority than 2016 because of the government’s achievements.The Congress has promised to hike the wages of tea garden workers...We are already providing two-and-a-half times the wages that were given during the Congress rule. When the Congress was in power, the workers had to pay cut money (commission) from their wages; the BJP ensured that salaries are credited straight to their accounts, for which 7.5 lakh accounts were opened. In the Union Budget, PM Modi has kept a separate fund of ₹1,000 crore for their health care, education and other needs. The tea workers know which party works for them; it is quite another thing to come for paryatan (tourism) and photo sessions.Have you set a target of how many seats the BJP will win in Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Puducherry?We will improve the seat share in all these states. In Tamil Nadu, there will be an NDA government.In West Bengal, there has been a lot of heartburn over ticket distribution, in some places you’ve had to change the candidates following protests.These are internal issues; since ours is a disciplined, cadre-based party, we will resolve these issues. These things will not impact the election. This election is of the people of Bengal and our cadre is with us and we are working together for parivartan (change).Some people complain that instead of organically increasing the strength, the party is relying on acquisition.But the party has already grown till the booth level. We have booth-level committees across 85% of the booths and it is a strong organisation that we have built in the state. You must know we are a cadre-based party and that is what matters to us the most.The issue of political violence has been flagged by the BJP. The party has sought the Election Commission’s intervention.Whenever a government is about to change, the police and the anti-social elements are the first ones to sniff the change...||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ht-interview-bjp-provided-road-map-for-sonar-bangla-says-amit-shah-101616541143665.html
24-03-2021||India||After alleged threats, Hathras victim’s kin refuse to attend hearing||Family members of the Hathras gang rape and murder victim will not appear for hearing in the case in the Hathras district court on Wednesday, the family’s counsel said.“Family members of the victim and I have decided to not attend court proceedings on Wednesday due to security concerns. On my behalf, an application will be submitted in the court informing it about the decision due to security concern,” counsel for the victim’s family, Seema Khushwaha, said. Khushwaha travels to Hathras from Delhi for court proceedings on every hearing.On March 5, a group of people allegedly threatened the victim’s family and their counsel in the court room after which the Lucknow bench of the Allahabad high court ordered the Hathras district judge to submit a report on the incident. “During the last hearing in Lucknow high court (on March 19), the CBI had submitted an application in the court seeking transfer of the case from Hathras to any other court in the state,” said Khushwaha. “Now, the high court will decide what to do in the next hearing.”The Dalit woman was gang-raped by four men in Hathras district on September 14. She died early on September 29.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-alleged-threats-hathras-victim-s-kin-refuse-to-attend-hearing-101616540787825.html
24-03-2021||India||Congress alters campaign strategy for southern states||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi’s engagements with students at a school in Kochi on Monday were part of a well-calibrated campaign of the party to leverage Gandhi’s popularity in the poll-bound state, some party leaders have suggested.Visuals of the former Congress president teaching Aikido, a Japanese martial art, at St Theresa school in Kochi were widely circulated on Monday.In the two southern states of Kerala and Tamil Nadu, both will vote on April 6, the Congress’s campaign strategy has shifted emphasis to local-level interactions, freewheeling sessions with targeted groups or sharing experiences with locals.“Instead of asking people to come to meet Rahul Gandhi, he is going to them,” a senior party strategist involved in the campaign in the two states said, requesting anonymity.The elections in Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Assam, West Bengal and Puducherry are crucial for the Congress after the party lost power in three states in the last three years due to internal conflicts. The Congress also faced defeats in the 2014 and 2019 Lok Sabha elections.Ahead of the assembly polls, the Congress is trying out the campaign strategy in the two states where Gandhi remains a popular figure. The former Congress president represents Kerala’s Wayanad in Lok Sabha.“90% of Gandhi’s campaign will revolve around small, roadside meetings, interactions with sub-local groups and students and roadshows. Large public rallies would be limited because we want to create images and moments which can go viral on social media. His speech might get lost in translation, but the images will remain for a long time,” said a second strategist who is currently based in Chennai, preferring anonymity.On Tuesday, Gandhi held a meeting in the corner of a street at Paruthumpara in Kerala’s Kottayam, followed by three public meetings at Manarkadu, Ponkunnam and Pala.Later in the day, receptions were held for him in Piravom and Kolencherry in Ernakulam and corner meetings at Muvattupuzha and Perumbavoor.In the early days of the campaign, Gandhi danced with the students of St Joseph’s Matriculation Hr Sec School in Kanyakumari’s Mulagumudu. He also accepted a push-ups challenge by a student at the school. In Kerala, he also dived into the sea with some fishermen and helped a group of villagers cook mushroom biryani in Tamil Nadu.“People are still talking about him cooking biryani. In the coming days, he would interact with coir mat makers and participate in their work. Lots of similar activities have been planned and a few more interaction with students will happen,” said the second strategist.The party has also roped in local marketing agencies to circulate images of Gandhi’s campaign and attract media attention.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-alters-campaign-strategy-for-southern-states-101616540313514.html
24-03-2021||India||Delhiwale: Glacier in a cart||Hot afternoon. Empty lane. Kamruddin enters. A young girl runs after his cart, asking the man for his signature treat, which she calls “baraf ka gola”—a ball of crushed ice on a wooden stick.Also known as chuski, the pavement speciality enters our world every year this time, though last year the successive lockdowns kept it away. The ice lolly is actually an unsung part of a vast buffet that keeps Delhi cool in summer: smoothies, gelatos, juices, kulfis, nimbu soda, roohafza sherbet, chaas, lassi, jaljeera, sugarcane juice, coconut water etc. The rendezvous with chuski, though, makes for a more intense elemental experience. You are literally eating the ice, composed of minuscule crystals, as if it was just scraped out of a Himalayan glacier.Chuski-seller Kamruddin is polite and restrained. He swiftly grates the ice on his special apparatus called “gola machine”, and addresses the little girl with the formal “aap” instead of “tum” or “tu,” inquiring about her preferred flavour — she picks kala khatta.It must be said that many chuski vendors resort to artificial flavouring. Kamruddin is one of them, he admits. It’s also true that some chuski establishments use natural flavours — a stall in Kamla Nagar serves a mango version during the mango season. There was a coffee chuski stall in Netaji Subhash Place, but alas, not many liked the combo. Pavement vendor Ashok, who hangs about Chandni Chowk’s Central Baptist Church, doles out refreshing bel-flavoured chuski. An air-conditioned Connaught Place restaurant serves chuski margarita, but the absence of the street takes away half the fun.Kamruddin’s no-fuss version is the one you are likely to find across the city alleys. The first bite is the most striking, as it sends a rush of cold waves across the body.A typical chuski cart, too, is a sight. The tall glass bottles of multicoloured syrups are lined up along both sides, while the old-fashioned ice grater is always of wood. Kamruddin has covered his block of ice in a grey handkerchief. He operates in south Delhi neighbourhoods, especially in Khirki village. “In winters, I sell peanuts,” he says, as he goes ahead pushing his cart.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhiwale-glacier-in-a-cart-101616540061902.html
24-03-2021||India||No public gatherings on Holi as Covid cases spike, orders DDMA||Celebrations and gatherings at public places and religious sites in the Capital are banned for Holi, Navaratri and Shab-e-Barat, and people arriving at the airport, train stations and bus terminals will be randomly tested, the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) ordered on Tuesday as the resurgence in the Covid-19 outbreak continued, with the city adding the highest number of new cases in more than three months. The 1,101 cases added on Tuesday were the highest since December 19. New cases in a single day have not been more than 1,000 since December 24.“It is anticipated that gatherings, congregations and public celebrations during upcoming festivals like Holi, Shab-e-Barat, Navratri, etc. may pose a considerable threat of spread of virus and may cause setback to the appreciable gains made in the suppression of chain of transmission of Covid-19 cases in Delhi. Considering this, it has been decided that public celebrations and all gatherings/congregations during upcoming festivals should not be allowed in public places,” said the order signed by chief secretary Vijay Dev.In Delhi, the DDMA order was flagged by various district administrations for more clarity as it did not state whether celebrations inside clubs, resorts and farmhouses will be allowed. “Clarity on this will be given on Wednesday. The matter has been raised to the DDMA,” said a senior government official, asking not to be named.Private parties in houses and private lawns will be allowed.The chief secretary issued a second order directing district health officials to start random testing of passengers coming from states that have seen a spike in Covid-19 cases.“All district disaster management authorities shall conduct random testing (RAT/RT-PCR) of passengers coming from the states where Covid-19 cases are increasing, at all airports, railway stations, inter-state bus terminals (ISBT) and other alighting points (for private buses) in NCT of Delhi,” the order stated.In a third order issued by divisional commissioner Sanjeev Khirwar late on Tuesday night, DDMA directed all DMs to intensify vaccination and crack down on those not adhering to Covid-appropriate behaviour.“There are several super-spreader areas like weekly markets, cinema, malls, metro services, religious places, etc. All the DMs should greatly intensify their enforcement efforts and awareness campaigns in these areas. Areas where sero surveillance is low should also be targeted with more intensive efforts,” read the order.DDMA asked the district teams to ensure samples are taken randomly at alighting points. “After collection of samples, the travellers would be allowed to exit. However, those passengers who are found positive, shall be mandatorily quarantined or isolated,” it said.District health teams will have to ensure that records of all such passengers are maintained, and surveillance, tracking and tracing is conducted as per the State Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (State IDSP) protocols.The district magistrates and DCPs have been asked to adequately inform and sensitise the field functionaries for strict compliance in letter and spirit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-public-gatherings-on-holi-as-covid-cases-spike-orders-ddma-101616538839121.html
24-03-2021||India||Two sisters found dead in field day after they went missing in UP||A 20-year-old girl and her 17-year-old sister were found dead in Bilsanda area of Pilibhit district of western Uttar Pradesh on Tuesday, police said.The sisters went missing from their house on Monday evening. The body of the younger sister was found in a field while that of the elder sister was found hanging from a tree, police said.“Both the girls have marks on their neck. It appears that they died of hanging or strangulation. We are waiting for the detailed post-mortem report. Three police teams have been formed to investigate the case,” said Jaiprakash, superintendent of police (SP), Pilibhit.The bodies were sent for post-mortem investigations and an FIR of murder has been registered, said police.The sisters worked at a brick kiln in the area and lived in shanties nearby. They left home around 7pm to relieve themselves but when they did not return after a few hours, their family members went out to search for them. “Around midnight, they found the body of the younger sister while that of the elder sister was found in the morning,” said the SP.The body of the younger sister was found in the field some 200 metres from their home. The body of elder sister was found hanging from a tree in a sugarcane field.“The family members informed police about the incident in the morning. A team of local police inspected the area. A dog squad and team of local field unit also visited the area and collected evidence,” the SP said.According to police, the family members have neither blamed anyone for the deaths nor alleged rape. Based on their complaint, police have lodged a case of murder (section 302 IPC) against unknown people. “Additional charges will be added in the case on the basis of findings of post-mortem investigation report,” said the SP.A mobile phone was found near the body of the older girl and police are taking help of IT experts to recover data from it. Police teams also quizzed over a dozen people, including family members and relatives. “People involved in the murder of the sisters will be arrested soon,” said the SP.A number of incidents of rape and murder have been reported from the state in the last few months, with the opposition questioning the Uttar Pradesh government over safety of women. Last year in September, people in different parts of the country took to the streets after a Dalit woman was allegedly gang-raped and brutalised by upper caste men in Hathras district. She later died in a Delhi hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/two-sisters-found-dead-in-field-day-after-they-went-missing-in-up-101616538573595.html
24-03-2021||India||Expect harsher summers as La Niña weakens||The cooling effect of La Niña, a global weather pattern, has started waning, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), which said that it may completely turn neutral during April, resulting in a harsh summer.La Niña is associated with the cooling of Pacific waters. A La Niña year generally receives good rainfall and temperatures are lower than normal.“La Niña has started weakening. It was at its peak in January and February. La Niña is often associated with lower temperatures in India. But that is now unlikely during the rest of the summer and monsoon months. But the actual weather conditions will depend on local synoptic features. For example, the interaction of westerlies and easterlies over central India is currently causing thunderstorm activity and temperatures have dropped. But overall, we can say La Niña will phase out gradually,” said DS Pai, senior climate scientist at IMD.IMD’s monsoon mission coupled forecasting system has indicated the likely warming of sea surface temperatures (SSTs) over the central and eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean in April and May, which indicates a transition of La Nina condition to El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO)-neutral condition. This means neither El Niño nor La Niña. El Niño is a warming of the ocean surface, or above-average sea surface temperatures.There is also a high probability that La Niña will re-emerge after or during the monsoon, according to IMD. “The weakening of La Niña conditions indicates a harsh summer is likely. There is a 60% probability of ENSO-neutral conditions in April. Thankfully, there is no chance of El Niño which makes summer even harsher in India. Monsoon is likely to be also normal this year as both the impact of El Niño or La Niña will not impact. We are also expecting La Niña to re-emerge after monsoon so it may remain moderate during upcoming winter,” said Mahesh Palawat, vice president, climate change and meteorology, at Skymet Weather.ENSO is a periodic fluctuation in sea surface temperatures and the air pressure of the overlying atmosphere across the equatorial Pacific Ocean, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). ENSO has a major influence on weather and climate patterns such as heavy rains, floods and drought. El Niño has a warming influence on global temperatures, while La Niña has the opposite effect. In India, for example, El Niño is associated with drought or weak monsoon, while La Niña is associated with strong monsoon and above average rains and colder winters.This winter was the third warmest since 1901, when IMD began keeping records, according to an IMD Pune analysis. It was also the second warmest in the past 120 years when minimum or early morning temperatures were considered. The warmest winter was recorded in 2016 followed by 2009.Scientists were surprised by the warming this winter despite moderate La Niña, which normally has a cooling effect.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/expect-harsher-summers-as-la-ni-a-weakens-101616538396048.html
24-03-2021||India||Supreme Court waives compound, penal interests on loans during moratorium||The Supreme Court on Tuesday ordered banks against charging borrowers any penal interest or compound interest (interest on interest) on loans during the moratorium on repayment of loans from March to August 2020 in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. It rejected a request by individuals and traders’ associations for waiver of complete interest during the moratorium. The court refused to extend the moratorium or tinker with the resolution mechanism proposed by Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to waive compound interest on six categories of loans up to ₹ 2 crore.A bench of Justices Ashok Bhushan, RS Reddy, and MR Shah issued the order on a clutch of petitions filed by corporate bodies, business associations, and individuals demanding extension of moratorium beyond August.At the instance of the court, the Centre agreed to waive compound interest on loans for six categories. The business associations and corporate bodies had demanded the extension of this benefit to borrowers with loans of above ₹2 crore.Also Read | Government planning crackdown on apps offering cash loans onlineThe bench said courts are not experts and such decisions lie in the realm of economic policy in which interference should be rarely made.It added the Covid-19 pandemic affected even the government. The bench said the Centre and RBI still came out with schemes and packages to reduce stress on businesses and granting any further relief would have consequences on the economy.The court clarified any penal interest or compound interest charged by banks for non-payment of any loan amount during moratorium shall be refundable. And if the bank is not in a position to refund, the same shall be adjusted in the loan amount, it added.The bench said decisions on economic policy matters should be left to the government and courts should not interfere even if a second view is possible.During the hearing of these cases, the Centre and RBI argued that compound interest on loans of up to ₹two crore was waived keeping in mind fiscal constraints and the viability of banks. Any order to further extend the benefit to other borrowers will make banks inviable, which an economy like India will be unable to sustain, the Centre and RBI argued.Some petitioners questioned the ceiling limit of ₹2 crore for waiving compound interest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-waives-compound-penal-interests-on-loans-during-moratorium-101616537545361.html
24-03-2021||India||81% of samples tested in Punjab positive for UK’s B.1.1.7 variant||Eighty one per cent of the 401 positive Covid-19 samples the Punjab health department had sent for genome sequencing to the National Institute of Virology, Pune, showed the presence of the new UK (B.1.1.7) strain, a more infectious variant of the virus.These samples were taken randomly from containment zones in all districts of the state between March 1 and 10.The UK strain has been found in 12 Punjab districts, including Mohali, Jalandhar, Patiala, Kapurthala, SBS Nagar, Hoshiarpur, Gurdaspur, Amritsar, Ludhiana, Rupnagar, Bathinda and Tarn Taran.In January, the state health department had sent 478 positive samples to the National Institute of Biologicals (NIB), Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (IGIB), Delhi, and the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) for genome sequencing, of which the results of 90 samples were received. Only two of these 90 samples had the N440K variant, also known as ‘Kerala’ strain, which according to health experts was the mutated version of the coronavirus in India.A Union ministry of health team had visited Punjab to review the increase in positivity rate. Thereafter, 401 more samples, collected between January 1 and March 10, were sent to the NCDC for genome sequencing, and worryingly, 326 showed the presence of the B.1.1.7 variant.Former PGIMER, Chandigarh, director and head of the state government’s Covid-19 management group Dr KK Talwar said, “This is worrying as the samples were taken from all districts. The new strain is 70% more infectious that the older one and that is why the rate of the spread is more during the second wave.”“Since the new strain spreads faster, more youngsters and those going out for work are getting infected now. Only ramping up of vaccination and less movement of people can help control the spread,” he added.Nearly two-thirds of Covid-19 patients in Punjab, which is witnessing a second virus wave, are aged between 20 and 60 (working-age population). The trend suggests that people in the age bracket have a high rate of mobility as they have to venture out of their homes for work or other purposes. The figures also show that those aged between 31 and 40 are the most vulnerable to contracting the virus, with 17.2% of the total cases falling in the category.Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Tuesday thanked Prime Minister Narendra Modi for widening the ambit of Covid-19 vaccination.All aged above 45 will now be vaccinated. Earlier in the day, he appealed to the Centre to do the needful, expressing concern over the emerging situation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/81-of-samples-tested-in-punjab-positive-for-uk-s-b-1-1-7-variant-101616536308386.html
24-03-2021||India||Covid-19 vaccines for all above 45 in India||Everyone above the age of 45 will be eligible to seek a coronavirus vaccine from April 1, the Union government announced on Tuesday, heeding to requests from experts as well as several states to allow more people to take shots at a time when the country is grappling with a sharp resurgence in cases.India recorded 47,239 cases on Tuesday, according to HT’s dashboard of data reported by states, the highest since November 8. The government’s Co-WIN dashboard showed that as of 7pm on Tuesday, a little over 41.5 million people have received their first doses, leaving less than 8 million who have gotten both their doses. The country targets inoculating 300 million people by the end of July.“Our appeal is that all above 45 should take vaccine as early as possible,” Union information and broadcasting minister Prakash Javadekar said following a Cabinet meeting, adding that the decision was based on scientific evidence and recommendations of experts in India’s Covid-19 Task Force. “There is no scarcity, and supply chains and supply lines are intact,” Javadekar said.In the 67 days since the campaign was launched, close to 50 million doses have been administered to people, but the recipients have been limited to those who are at higher risk due to their age (60 and above), pre-existing health conditions (as long as they are 45 and older) or their profession (if they work as health workers or as front line service staff).Javadekar said that from April 1, people above the age of 45 will not need to present medical certificates showing that they suffer from any of the predetermined medical conditions.“The registration process for this category will begin from April 1,” said Rajesh Bhushan, Union health secretary. The Co-WIN platform is being tweaked to allow this.According to an analysis of Covid-19 infection and mortality trends in India, 62% of all infections have been among people below the age of 45. However, people above this age account for almost 9 in 10 (87%) deaths, making targeting this age band more crucial for inoculation.At least three states — Maharashtra, Punjab and Kerala — urged the government in recent days to allow more people to seek doses and expedite deliveries. The latest of these appeals was by Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh, who said the urgency deepened after the variant B.1.1.7 (first identified in UK) was detected in 81% of samples taken from the state at random for genomic sequencing.B.1.1.7, first found in UK’s Kent, has been established to spread more readily and has been connected to new waves in several countries. The variant has not been established to reduce the efficacy of vaccines in a significant manner, unlike the B.1.351 and P.1 variants first found in South Africa and Brazil.Experts welcomed the decision to allow more people to be covered. “There is no other way but to vaccinate as many as possible, and quickly, to cut the cycle of Covid-19 transmission,” said Dr GC Khilnani, former head of pulmonology department, New Delhi’s All India Institute of Medical Sciences.Government data showed that in February, when only health and front-line workers were eligible, around 300,000 doses were being administered on average. This number has increased to at least 1.5 million in March, when the government allowed the first of the general public to come forward.A second expert said the country should now target higher numbers. “Covering about 10 million a day will ensure that India covers the entire vulnerable population within a month or so, as it will help prevent any sort of second waves in the country,” said Dr Giridhara R Babu, professor and head, epidemiology division, Indian Institute of Public Health.“It is a wise thing that the government has done as in our country vulnerability does extend to younger population as well, especially in urban areas,” said Dr K Srinath Reddy, founder, Public Health Foundation of India.Last week, the government placed orders for 120 million more doses of Covishield and Covaxin – the two coronavirus vaccines approved in the country at present.During the media briefing, Javadekar added that the Cabinet endorsed Union health ministry’s decision to increase the interval for administering the second dose of Covishield to a maximum of eight weeks, compared to six before, in order to gain better efficacy.Some states have also given doses to a few outside the priority groups to avoid vaccine wastage. About 6.5% of India’s vaccine doses go to waste, the health ministry said last week, making it vital for health workers to coordinate the flow.India is also expected to soon approve Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine for emergency use.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-vaccines-for-all-above-45-in-india-101616536031715.html
24-03-2021||India||Focus on test-track-treat protocol: MHA to states||Amid a spike in coronavirus cases, the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) on Tuesday issued fresh guidelines, directing all states and Union territories to enhance RT-PCR tests, ensure strict enforcement of test-track-treat protocol and increase the pace of vaccination to cover all priority groups.While the Centre did not consider imposing another fresh lockdown to keep the economy running, it is important that citizens follow coronavirus-related appropriate behavior such as wearing masks, maintaining social distance and hand hygiene, people familiar with the developments said.“…to ensure that the resumption of activities is successful and to fully overcome the pandemic, there is need to strictly follow the prescribed containment strategy, and strictly observe the guideline issued by MHA and Ministry of Health & Family Welfare (MOHFW) and other ministries/departments of the central government and state/ UT governments,” the guidelines released by the ministry said.In its latest guidelines, the ministry announced that all fresh cases will require to be isolated or quarantined at the earliest and provided timely treatment. All contacts of the infected cases will also have to be traced quickly and isolated, it added.Considering a surge in Covid-19 cases (over 40,000 cases were reported on Tuesday), the new guidelines made it mandatory for states and UTs to strictly enforce the ‘test-track-treat’ protocol, emphasizing that the proportion of RT-PCR tests should be increased to prescribed level of 70% or more.Based on the positive cases and tracking of their contacts, containment zones shall be carefully demarcated by the district authorities at the micro level, the ministry said.Expressing concerns over the uneven vaccination in several states, the ministry said: “The vaccination against Covid-19, in the present scenario, is critical to break the chain of transmission and hence all state and union territory governments should rapidly step up the pace of vaccination to cover all priority groups in an expeditious manner.”The Centre allowed states to impose their own local restrictions like night curfew or weekend restrictions in the district, sub-district or city level, based on the situation, but added that there won’t be restriction on any inter-state and intra-state movement.It also directed states to impose appropriate fines on those not wearing masks in public as well as work spaces.All activities have been permitted outside containment zones and standard operating procedures (SOPs) have been prescribed for various activities. These include movement by passenger trains, air travel, metro trains, schools, higher educational institutions, hotels and restaurants, shopping malls, multiplexes and entertainment parks, yoga centres and gymnasiums, exhibitions, assemblies and congregations, the guidelines said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/focus-on-test-track-treat-protocol-mha-to-states-101616531223194.html
24-03-2021||India||Nuns’ detention in Uttar Pradesh fans Kerala poll furore||The brief detention of a group of nuns by Government Railway Police (GRP) following complaints of alleged forced conversion by Bajrang Dal activists in Uttar Pradesh’s Jhansi district has generated a political firestorm in Kerala ahead of the crucial assembly elections next month.The nuns’ congregation belongs to Syro-Malabar Church which is based in Kerala.While the Kerala Catholic Bishops Conference (KCBC) and Syro-Malabar Church have sought action against the activists, opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala rushed a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi demanding immediate action in the case.The incident occurred at a time when the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is wooing Christian minorities who form 16 per cent of the votebank to get a foothold in the central Travancore area.In a detailed statement, the church media commission said that the nuns and a group of girls were on their way from Delhi to Odisha in a train on March 19 for Easter celebrations when they were confronted by the Bajrang Dal activists in Jhansi. The church claimed that the nuns were verbally abused and activists tried to attack the girls, whom they believed, were being taken away for religious conversion.“They did not believe nuns’ words that all were born Christians and continued to question them. Later, the nuns were taken into police custody at Jhansi after they alerted the railway police. They were threatened and terrorised by the right wing workers,” Father Jerry Joseph, spokesperson of the commission, said. He added that the nuns were released after three hours of questioning and transferred to the Bishop’s House in Jhansi.“It was a terrifying incident. They were not even considerate towards the women. Around 150 Bajrang Dal activists surrounded us and behaved as though we were criminals,” one of the nuns said, preferring anonymity.“It is totally unacceptable. Thousands of nuns and priests are engaged in humanitarian activities across the country. We want a high-level intervention,” KCBC said.Sunil Singh, SHO and GRP, Jhansi, said the nuns and girls were deboarded after the activists suspected that the girls were being taken away for religious conversion. “The police investigated and found no such thing. The nuns and students were later sent with a reverend,” he said.The leaders from the church also plan to meet Union Home Minister Amit Shah, who is arriving in the state on Wednesday for campaigning, in this regard.In his letter to Modi, Chennithala said: “It is a serious incident. Poor nuns were terrorised and attacked. The government will have to ensure speedy justice to them.”The ruling CPI(M) also condemned the incident. “It exposes intolerance towards minority communities in north India,” the party said in a statement.The state BJP sent a letter to Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on the matter.“The party condemns the incident. It seems the police also took hasty action without verifying the facts. We want action against the perpetrators and police officials who detained the nuns,” party vice president George Kurian said in his letter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nuns-detention-in-uttar-pradesh-fans-kerala-poll-furore-101616531211204.html
24-03-2021||India||MVA didn’t act on evidence of scam in police dept: Devendra Fadnavis||Leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis on Tuesday accused the ruling Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government of not acting on “incriminating evidence” supplied as a report by former Commissioner of State Intelligence Rashmi Shukla on a “money for transfer” scam in the state police department.HT has seen a copy of the report, dated August 25, 2020, which names senior politicians, middlemen and police officers, who allegedly sought transfers and postings of their liking.The report, which is based on intercepted phone calls of six people -- it was not immediately clear if this was done through proper channels -- states that they were middlemen who helped police officials seek postings of their choice, and brought up names of politicians such as Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar and home minister Anil Deshmukh, in their alleged conversations.The report does not state that the middlemen spoke to these leaders directly. It contends that one middlemen is an assistant in the home minister’s office.The report does not talk about any direct transfer of money to these politicians. It does, however, refer to “monetary exchange” between police officers and middlemen acting in close connection with politicians.There was no reaction from chief minister’s office to the report. Deshmukh was not available for comments.In a press conference held in Mumbai on Tuesday, Fadnavis said Shukla submitted the report to the then Director General of Police Subodh Kumar Jaiswal on August 25, 2020, who in turn forwarded the report to Sitaram Kunte, the then additional chief secretary, home, the following day.Fadnavis met the Union home secretary in Delhi and demanded a CBI probe. “The Union home secretary clearly told me that they will verify the documents and evidence and a report will be submitted to the central government. The government will take appropriate action accordingly,” he told reporters in the national capital.Fadnavis said that he had 6.3GB of data from the intercepted calls, which contained the voices of police officers and politicians closely related to the home minister and home department.While Fadnavis said Shukla had “sought proper permissions from then additional chief secretary-home and intercepted phone calls of several police officials and politician”, NCP spokesperson and state minister Nawab Malik said on Tuesday that Shukla had intercepted calls illegally.“She prepared the call records illegally hence she was transferred as a punishment,” Malik said. He added that “80% of the transfers mentioned in the report did not take place.”The State Intelligence Department (SID) is a sensitive wing of the police and it is a serious issue if communication between its chief and a DGP came out in the open, Maharashtra NCP chief and minister Jayant Patil said on Tuesday.A question also arises about how the previous BJP-led government used the SID, Patil said. “On whose directions was the phone tapping done? Who had given the right to (then Commissioner of Intelligence) Rashmi Shukla to tap the phones? Was permission to tap phones taken? All this needs to be investigated,” he said.The report names police officers who were in touch with six middlemen for transfers to desired posts.“It is a serious matter and necessitates urgent action by the state government. It is recommended that this be brought to the notice of Hon. Chief Minister at the earliest and an immediate and comprehensive enquiry by State CID (Crime), Pune be ordered to identify concerned individuals and take necessary legal action. It is also advised that the secrecy of this report be ensured, in order to prevent unnecessary scrutiny, which may bring disrepute to the government,” Jaiswal wrote in the covering letter when he submitted the report to ACS, Home.The report cited an instance of an IPS officer who wanted to be posted in Nashik. The report said that the officer met deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, environment minister Aaditya Thackeray, home minister Anil Deshmukh. He also met NCP chief Sharad Pawar along with a few local MLAs belonging to the Congress and the NCP.“Since Nashik has a sitting Shiv Sena MLA, Ajit Pawar suggested the transfer will need the approval from chief minister Uddhav Thackeray. As suggested by Ajit Pawar, the DCP met Sharad Pawar at his Nariman Point office. In turn, Pawar sent a message to Thackeray on WhatsApp. The DCP will get his desired posting done for sure,” the report stated, quoting the conversation from the intercepted calls of the middleman.There was no mention in the report of any money changing hands, or an any explicit impropriety in the transfer.In the summary to the report, Shukla wrote: “The aforesaid brokers were in close contacts and embroiled in these negotiations with several influential and the police officers ranging from inspectors to several high-ranking officers are in contact with such undesirable individuals. The information obtained and evidence collected is highly incriminating and gravely implicates a number of individuals engaged in this activity.”Malik, however, said on Tuesday that the transfer of policemen was a procedural affair and did not occur as mentioned in the report.Shukla, who is on central deputation, did not respond to the phone calls or text messages.A delegation of BJP leaders including Fadnavis, state unit chief Chandrakant Patil, Sudhir Mungantiwar and Ashish Shelar will meet Maharashtra governor BS Koshyari on Wednesday. “We want governor Koshyari to seek a detailed status report from the chief secretary of Maharashtra,” said a senior BJP leader.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mva-didn-t-act-on-evidence-of-scam-in-police-dept-devendra-fadnavis-101616530216145.html
24-03-2021||India||Indian Army signs contract for 1.7 million medals||Soldiers will no longer have to buy replicas of medals from the market, with the Indian Army on Tuesday announcing that it has concluded a contract for procuring 1.7 million medals.Soldiers are awarded medals for gallantry and distinguished service among other key landmarks in their military careers.Resolving a decade-old problem, the army said it has signed a contract for 17 different types of medals. “Integrated Headquarters of Ministry of Defence (Army) has concluded a contract for procurement of a total of 17.27 lakh service medals of 17 different types,” it said on Twitter.“The procurement has enabled Indian Army to meet all outstanding demands of service medals in respect of soldiers who have served and are serving in the Indian Army,” the army added.In contrast to original medals, the replica medals do not have the names of the soldiers and their service numbers engraved on them. For almost 10 years, soldiers have been purchasing medals from the market as the army grappled with the shortage.Soldiers could just approach shops selling service medals and buy them as per their requirement, an official familiar with the matter said. There was no need to produce any certificate to make the purchase.Gopinath Bazar in Delhi Cantt is a popular place for soldiers to buy replica medals. Other cantonments in the country also have shops that sell medals and other military items such as uniforms and boots. Soldiers and veterans wear these medals only during ceremonial functions.While there was no shortage of medals awarded to soldiers for gallantry, the defence ministry’s department of medals had failed to issue other varieties of medals, another official said on condition of anonymity.In 2016-17, the medals department was saddled with more than 1.4 million medals of various types.The soldiers, by default, are entitled to a variety of medals after completing a certain number of years in service, serving in difficult areas or taking part in various operations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indian-army-signs-contract-for-1-7-million-medals-101616530209175.html
24-03-2021||India||Bihar’s new police bill explained and why it has evoked protests||The Bihar Special Armed Police Bill, 2021 has triggered strong protest from the Opposition, which is demanding its withdrawal due to “unbridled powers to the police to carry out raids and arrests without warrant”, while the government terms it the need of the hour in view of growing needs to safeguard important installations. Once enacted, the Bihar Military Police will be called Bihar Special Armed Police and it will give such powers to the Bihar Special Armed Police that the Opposition feels would usher in ‘police raj’. There have been widespread protests against it both within the House and outside. Police had to resort to lathi-charge to rein in protesting RJD workers in the state capital. However, the Opposition has declared that it would not accept anything less than the withdrawal of the ‘black law’. Here are the highlights of the bill: Why is the bill necessary? As per the preamble says, the Bihar Police Act 2007 was published in the official gazette on March 30 2007. Prior to that police services of the state were governed by the Police Act, 1861 and the rules framed there under and Bihar Military Police in the State was governed by Bengal Military Police Act, 1892. Bihar, being a rapidly developing state, requires an armed police force with multi-domain expertise to meet requirements of industrial security, security of vital installations, airports, metro rail etc in larger interest of the State. The internal security of Bihar needs to be strengthened through a dedicated, well trained and fully equipped armed police force of the state. Keeping in view the role of Bihar Military Police and its distinct organizational structure, it is necessary that its separate identity should continue to be maintained as a Special Armed Police to achieve the above objectives; Therefore, it is expedient to make provision for the constitution, organized development and better regulation of a multi-domain Special Armed Police Force. What will it do? The bill says it will be for maintenance of public order, combating extremism, ensuring the better protection and security of specified establishments in such manner as may be notified and perform such other duties, as may be notified. The Special Armed Police shall be constituted into one or more Battalions in such manner and for such period as may be prescribed. The general superintendence of the Special Armed Police shall vest in and be exercised by the Government. The command, supervision and administration 19 of the Special Armed Police shall vest in the Director General of Police, Bihar. The Government shall appoint to the Special Armed Police such number of Inspectors General, Deputy Inspectors General, Commandants and such other rank police officers, as may be notified. Power to arrest without warrant Any Special Armed Police Officer, while being entrusted with the security of specified establishment may without any order from a Magistrate and without a warrant, arrest any person who voluntarily causes hurt to, or attempts voluntarily to cause hurt to, or wrongfully restrains or attempts wrongfully to restrain or assaults, threatens to assault, or uses, or threatens or attempts to use, criminal force to any employee of such specified establishment, or to him or any Special Armed Police Officer, in discharge of his duty as such employee or in execution of his duty as such Special Armed Police Officer, as the case may be, or with intent to prevent or to deter him from discharging his duty as such Special Armed Police Officer, or in 20 consequence of anything done or attempted to be done by him in the lawful discharge of his duty as such Special Armed Police Officer Arrests on suspicion The officer can arrest any person who has been concerned in, or against whom a reasonable suspicion exists of his having been concerned in, or who is found taking precautions to conceal his presence under circumstances which afford reason to believe that he is taking such precautions with a view to committing, a cognizable offence which relates to property belonging to, or in the premises of, any such specified establishment. Arrests can also take place if any person who commits or attempts to commit a cognizable offence which involves or which is likely to involve danger to the life of any person engaged in carrying on any work relating to any specified establishment. If any person is found trespassing on the premises of any specified establishment, he may, without prejudice to any other proceedings which may be taken against him, be removed from such premises by any Special Armed Police Officer. Power to search without warrant Whenever any Special Armed Police Officer, not below the notified rank, has reason to believe that any offence has been or is being committed and that a search warrant cannot be obtained without affording the offender an opportunity of escaping or of concealing evidence of the offence, he may detain the offender and search his person and belongings forthwith and, if he thinks proper, arrest any person whom he has reason to believe to have committed the offence. The provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 relating to searches under that Code shall, so far as may be, apply to searches under this section. Procedure to be followed after arrest Any Special Armed Police Officer making an arrest under this Act, shall, without unnecessary delay, make over the person so arrested to a police officer, or, in the absence of a police officer, take such person or cause him to be taken to the nearest police station together with a report of the circumstances occasioning the arrest. Privileges of Senior Officers of Special Armed Police The Director General/Additional Director General/such other rank police officer appointed as head of the Special Armed Police and other police officers including Inspectors General, Deputy Inspectors General, Commandants and Deputy Commandants of the Special Armed Police shall be entitled to all the privileges which a police officer has under the Bihar Police Act, 2007, the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 and any other enactment for the time being in force. Procedure for court taking cognizance of offence No court shall take cognizance of any offence under this Act when the accused person is a special armed police officer except on a report in writing of the facts constituting such offence and with the previous sanction of an officer authorised by the Government in this behalf. Protection of Special Armed Police In any suit or proceedings against any member of the Special Armed Police for any act done by him in pursuance of an order of a competent authority, it shall be lawful for him to plead that such act was done by him under the authority of such order. Rules to be laid before the House Every rule framed under this Act shall be published in the Gazette. (b) All rules made by the State Government under this Act shall be laid as soon as may be after they are made, before each house of the State Legislature while it is in session, for a total period of thirty days, which may be comprised in one session or more successive sessions. If the State Legislature agrees to modify the rule or the legislature agrees that the rule should not be made, the rule shall thereafter have effect only in such modified form or be of no effect, as the case may be; So however that, any such modification or annulment shall be, without prejudice to the validity of anything done under that rule. Provisions of this Act to override other laws The provisions of this Act shall have overriding effect, notwithstanding anything inconsistent therewith contained in any other law for the time being in force or any instrument having effect by virtue of any such law. References in any Act, rule, notification or order to the Bengal Military Police Act, 1892 shall, on the commencement of this Act, be construed as reference to the Bihar Special Armed Police Act, 2021.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bihars-new-police-bill-explained-and-why-it-has-evoked-protests-101616530858499.html
24-03-2021||India||Atmosphere devoid of terror must for cordial ties, PM Modi writes to Imran Khan||An atmosphere of trust, devoid of terror and hostility, is “imperative” for better relations between India and Pakistan, Prime Minister Narendra Modi told his Pakistani counterpart Imran Khan on Tuesday.The message was part of a letter of greetings send by Modi to Khan on the occasion of Pakistan Day. People familiar with developments, speaking on condition of anonymity, described the letter as a routine message sent to heads of government or state on national days.“As a neighbouring country, India desires cordial relations with the people of Pakistan. For this, an atmosphere of trust, devoid of terror and hostility, is imperative,” said the letter.The letter also referred to the impact of Covid-19 as a “difficult time for humanity”, and conveyed Modi’s best wishes to Khan and the people of Pakistan “for dealing with the challenges” of the pandemic.A separate message was sent by President Ram Nath Kovind to his Pakistani counterpart Arif Alvi, the people cited above said.After it emerged on Saturday that Khan had tested positive for Covid-19 and was self-isolating at home, Modi had tweeted: “Best wishes to Prime Minister @ImranKhanPTI for a speedy recovery from COVID-19.”Earlier on Tuesday, Pakistan’s chargé d’affaires Aftab Hasan Khan said his country desires friendly relations with all nations, including India, and the two sides should resolve all outstanding issues through dialogue.The diplomat made the remarks while addressing an event organised at the Pakistan high commission to mark Pakistan Day. The comments came against the backdrop of a thaw in bilateral relations after the armies of the two countries recommitted themselves to the 2003 ceasefire along the Line of Control (LoC) last month.“Pakistan wants to have friendly relations with all countries including India,” Aftab Hasan Khan said, according to a statement issued by the Pakistani mission.“To achieve peace between Pakistan and India, both countries shall resolve all outstanding issues including [Jammu and Kashmir] through dialogue,” he said. Peace within South Asia is “inevitable” for the larger interest of the region, he added.The chargé d’affaires spoke after raising the Pakistani flag at the brief ceremony with limited participation in view of the pandemic. Messages from the president and prime minister of Pakistan were also read out at the ceremony.Noting that Muslims under the leadership of Muhammad Ali Jinnah had made a resolve to create a separate homeland on March 23, 1940, the chargé d’affaires said the day is observed as Pakistan Day every year.The Indian and Pakistani high comissions in Islamabad and New Delhi are currently headed by the deputy chiefs of mission as Pakistan decided not to post an envoy in the Indian capital after Jammu and Kashmir’s special status was scrapped in August 2019. Pakistan also expelled the Indian envoy and downgraded diplomatic ties.The Indian and Pakistani armies began strictly adhering to the 2003 ceasefire on the LoC in Jammu and Kashmir from the midnight of February 24 – the apparent outcome of behind-the-scenes contacts between senior security officials of the two countries.Last week, Pakistan Army chief Gen Qamar Bajwa said the time has come for India and Pakistan to “bury the past and move forward”, though he cautioned that any peace process would be susceptible to disruption without the resolution of the Kashmir issue.Bajwa’s conciliatory remarks came a day after Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan said India will have to take the first step for improving bilateral ties by addressing Kashmir, the only issue standing in the way of better relations.The foreign ministers of India and Pakistan are set to participate in the ministerial meeting of the Heart of Asia-Istanbul Process in the Tajikistan capital of Dushanbe on March 30. However, it is still not clear whether they will hold a bilateral meeting in Dushanbe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/atmosphere-devoid-of-terror-must-for-cordial-ties-pm-modi-writes-to-imran-khan-101616530192152.html
24-03-2021||India||Early lockdown helped shore up infra: Experts||On March 25, India entered one of the world’s strictest lockdowns aimed at slashing the transmission of the coronavirus disease. When Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced it (first as a 21-day period), the country had 536 reported infections. The most stringent phase of the restriction would eventually be extended several times, lasting 68 days. By June 1, when the first of the measures were eased the country had over 198,000 infections.India thus became possibly the only large country that locked down even before it was hit by a surge of cases. The country’s first wave began building progressively as the country “unlocked” – rising steadily through the months between July and October, and peaking right around the festival season in November.The variation in the strategy from the rest of the world – which mostly rolled out restrictions only when cases surged – has divided experts, although they mostly see it to have helped.“If we had a situation where everybody follows the government instructions, then there would have been no need for a lockdown. Countries like Vietnam, Thailand, and Japan have all shown that it is possible to manage without the lockdown as long as you have the resources, the ability and the commitment,” said Dr Gagandeep Kang, professor of microbiology at Christian Medical College, Vellore.“If your life is so desperate that you cannot follow the government instructions, then you won’t. In that sense, I think the lockdown was necessary because it conveyed to the people that it is a serious issue and it stopped the movement of people,” said Dr Kang.The lockdown, she added, had significant consequences for livelihoods, especially among migrant workers. “It also created a fear in the minds of people, leading to stigmatisation. I was really worried about the government controlled testing of Sars-Cov-2. When they set up testing in January, it was only NIV (National Institute of Virology, Pune) doing the testing, only NIV confirming it. And, that is impossible for a country the size of India.”The lockdown helped buy time for India to at least improve its testing capacity. “Fortunately for us, when we had the lockdown, it slowed things down. If the lockdown had been a lockdown where imports were still allowed, it would have been better.”A second expert said the early lockdown was also crucial for India’s stressed health infrastructure to prepare itself. “The lockdown was important at that point of time. One, it slowed the spread of the infection as there was less interaction among people, less movement of people. If it hadn’t been done, the curve would be sharper, and it would have been sooner. Two, it gave the states time to build their infrastructure. There weren’t adequate oxygen or ICU beds then,” said Dr Rakesh Mishra, director, Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology, Hyderabad.“Whether it could have been implemented in a better manner to avoid the difficulty of people, maybe. In hindsight, we can say anything but at that time, there was a lot of panic in the European countries, we did not know anything about the disease. It was an unprecedented situation,” he added.At present, with cases rising again, the country could be in a better position to avoid such harsh suppression measures. “Now, we are much better placed. We have the infrastructure, we know how the disease can be managed. And, we have a vaccine. For the current increase in the number of cases – assuming that states are conducting enough tests and the more accurate RT-PCR – we should have local restrictions based on local data,” Dr Mishra added.“In places where there isn’t a surge in cases, people should still remember to mask up at all times. And, in places where the numbers are going up, there have to be some restrictions put in place,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/early-lockdown-helped-shore-up-infra-experts-101616530187207.html
24-03-2021||India||The tragic lessons of Covid migrant crisis||In August last year, Bamda Paharia finally gave up.The 48-year-old worker had migrated from Jharkhand in February that year to work at a construction site for ₹7,000 a month – the first time he was stepping out of his remote tribal hamlet, ravaged by acute unemployment.Weeks later, the government locked down the country to arrest the spread of Covid-19. Public transport went off the roads, trains stopped, and industry ground to a halt. Overnight, Paharia was thrown out of his rented accommodation after his contractor refused to pay his wages.No job in hand or penny in his pocket, Paharia started scrounging the Capital’s deserted streets for food and shelter. He sometimes slept on the streets, sometimes in homes started by the government and social organisations, and ate at community kitchens started across the city.When his fellow labourers started pouring out of Delhi into the highways, Paharia kept put. A frail man hailing from an impoverished tribe, he had neither the physical strength nor the networks required to undertake the 1,400km journey.With his meagre savings dwindling, Paharia took to begging when the city started opening up from May. He spoke only Santhali, had few friends and didn’t own a phone, so no one told him when the government started special trains to ferry workers like him back to their homes.In the last week of August, Paharia suddenly found himself at the New Delhi railway station. He had never been there before, having been brought in a bus from Jharkhand’s Sahibganj to Delhi.He looked up, and other groups of workers were leaving for their home states. “But I had no money to buy a ticket, and anyway, no one understood my language,” he said. Paharia stood at station for a long time, trying to talk to people. From broken conversations, he inferred the direction and tracks taken by Jharkhand-bound trains.“I decided to start walking along the railway track to reach home. I had no idea how far it was and how many days it could take,” he said.PAINFUL JOURNEYWith a pair of fraying rubber chappals, Paharia started walking. The Jharkhand administration later estimated that he quickly got lost as he strayed from the railway track in search of food and shelter.For weeks, he walked through forests, villages, fields – often on an empty stomach. He made do with green leaves or fruits that had fallen from trees along the tracks. Sometimes, he begged for food and water in villages that fell along the route.He slept near tracks, railway stations or adjoining villages. Many people offered him food on the way, thinking he was a beggar or mentally ill. “But I just walked, thinking I will reach home one day,” he said.On March 11, members of a local NGO found an exhausted man wandering along a railway crossing in Mahuda town, 1,200km from Delhi. “He said he did not eat for many days. We provided him food and clothes, and raised fund for his transportation to Sahebganj,” said Suraj Kumar, a member of the NGO Roti Bank.On March 13, he reached his home village of Amarbitha to the shock and surprise of his wife, Nandri Paharia, and three daughters. “We did not know about his journey. We thought he was earning in Delhi. I could not contact him for past eight months, as he had no phone with him,” said his wife.The local administration has started a probe into the middleman, identified as Rajesh Thakur, who sent Paharia to Delhi and later duped him of his wages. “Thakur is absconding since Paharia reached his village. We have lodged a complaint with police,” said block development officer Suman Sourabh.The government is now providing Paharia with free ration, monthly pension of ₹1,000 and signed them up for housing scheme. At any rate, Paharia is determined to never leave his two-room thatched house in the scenic foothills of the Rajmahal range. He never wants to go back to Delhi.TRAGIC ICONSThe pandemic threw up many such Paharias.There is Mohammad Saiyub, whose photo cradling his dying best friend Amrit Kumar, on the side of a highway in the middle of the lockdown, went viral. Saiyub, a 23-year-old resident of Uttar Pradesh and Kumar were childhood friends who moved away for better fortunes. They shared a tenement at a textile unit in Surat and were on their way back home when Kumar fell sick and died in Madhya Pradesh. Saiyub returned home to Basti district but he finds it difficult to sustain with his local business, and cannot fulfil his one wish: help his best friend’s family.There is Rampukar Pandit, who broke down near Delhi’s Nizamuddin bridge while talking to his wife on the phone. Pandit, a construction worker, had moved to the Capital from Bihar’s Begusarai district and was stuck in the city after March 25. But in early May, his wife told him that their youngest son was grievously ill and could die. Desperate to reach home, Pandit tried to dodge restrictions, get some money for a ticket, but failed. By the time he reached home in the second week of May, his son was dead.And, there was Jyoti Kumari, a 17-year-old girl who pedalled her purple bicycle from Gurugram to Darbhanga district in Bihar with her injured father in tow. With help from other migrant workers, short lifts from truck drivers and food from local people, they reached their village nine days later.A tweet from Ivanka Trump and national media attention brought her accolades, an offer of a biopic, and a trial at the cycling federation of India. It also improved their social status in the village as upper-caste families suddenly wanted to bask in the glory of their Dalit neighbour.Together, they became the face of the plight of millions of workers who brought home the horrors and pain of India’s deeply unequal development process that spawned the internal migration crisis.“The migrant crisis exposed and made visible the brutal spatial pattern of India’s economy: that there is a spatial rift between the regions of surplus labor and regions where work is available,” said Sai Balakrishnan, a professor at the University of Berkeley.IMPLICATIONS ON PUBLIC HEALTHAt the time, experts and government officers worried about the public health implications of migrant workers carrying back the virus from cities to the countryside, where poverty was widespread and medical infrastructure thin.But with the exception of some districts – Ganjam in Odisha that saw the second-highest virus deaths in the state – there was no major correlation between migrants returning and massive infection spikes.“It turned out better than we thought, and indeed, better than anyone else might have predicted. Some states saw a rise in cases but not all and it’s not specifically clear whether migrants were responsible for the increase in numbers or simply some travel from cities, where the disease was well entrenched initially, to more rural areas,” said Gautam Menon, a professor of Physics and Biology at Ashoka University.According to him, the migrant crisis was tackled differently in different states.In rural Karnataka, stringent control measures and targeted testing appeared to have checked the disease spread. In Odisha, some districts saw a spike that was directly correlated to the return of migrants. In Bihar, there didn’t seem to be any correlation between migrant return and increase in cases, he said.Uttar Pradesh and Bihar – two highly populous states with the largest number of migrant workers – consistently reported a relatively smaller numbers of cases and deaths relative to their population. Their test positivity rates were also low, suggesting that this isn’t just a fallout of inadequate testing. “This is a priori surprising, but suggestive of the fact that the influx of migrants returning from the cities might not have been a key contributor to the spread across these states,” said Menon.Scientists now estimate that the relatively young age of the local population in the migrant’s home states and measures taken by district administration to quarantine them may have worked. “There’s little doubt that many of those who returned carried the infection with them… but as far as we can see, the impact was reduced compared to what was feared initially,” said Menon.LESSONS LEARNTExperts and policymakers are still learning from the crisis that is considered the biggest incident of internal movement of people since the Partition.The government says it swiftly moved to help migrants.The ‘one nation, one ration card’ programme to enable countrywide access to subsidised grain for 20.4 million migrant workers is now operational in all states.The Union government announced relief under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana (PMGKY), which includes a one-time ex gratia payment of ₹500 per month for three months, hiked rates under the rural jobs scheme, and instituted the ₹50,000 crore Garib Kalyan Rojgar Abhiyaan to boost employment and livelihood opportunities for returnee migrant workers in India’s most backward districts.“More than 50 crore man-days of employment was created under the abhiyaan with an expenditure of Rs. 39292.81 crore,” rural development minister Narendra Singh Tomar told Parliament last week.The government ordered last September a nationwide survey of internal migrants to plug data gaps. The Union labour ministry told Lok Sabha last week that the number of internal migrants was currently estimated at around 100 million.The government also ran 4,621 Shramik special trains between May 1 and August 31, carrying 6.3 million passengers. But workers said these trains were packed, had no water or food and were poorly scheduled. At least 97 people died while travelling in these trains. This didn’t include 16 people who were run over by a freight train while sleeping on the tracks.“These migrant deaths raise urgent questions on public infrastructure, who was allowed to remain mobile and who was made immobile, why was capital allowed to circulate but not labour, and how these decisions around public infrastructure make visible the differentiated rights amongst India’s publics,” said Balakrishnan.RETHINKING STRATEGY Experts urge more robust responses that fundamentally re-imagine the country’s development strategy. They identify three main challenges.One, reorient the country’s development strategy that has spurred internal migration in the belief that it was labour’s business to reach capital, wherever it is. This resulted in labour sinks in the east and north that provide workers to the industrial powerhouses of the south and west.“How, for instance, can India develop thriving economic clusters in the lower Gangetic plain? The lower Gangetic plain is now a peripheral location that exports surplus labour that creates value in the core regions of western India; how can these unequal core-periphery relations be dismantled?” asked Balakrishnan.Two, imagine new labour relations in the wake of the pandemic.Usually, contractors in rural districts act as middlemen to aggregate workers and send them to big cities. Workers often migrate with the help of a friend or relative in the same city. “But this system has no time for formal training and can only work for low-skilled jobs. So workers are trapped in a low-income, low-skilled jobs cycle,” said Narender Pani, a professor at the National Institute of Advanced Studies in Bengaluru.Pani said even the one nation, one ration scheme may not help because it doesn’t change labour relations. “The ration card is used by the entire household, and migrants come individually. Plus, the system is digital so there can be many gaps,” he said.Three, make cities more habitable and accessible for poor migrant workers. This is especially tricky given that migration patterns are based on workers finding cities too expensive to live in long-term. “Moreover, many contractors lost credibility last year when they failed to get workers back home. So that system is also collapsing,” said Pani.When workers got back to their villages, many found no source of income and poor agricultural returns forced them to go back to cities after a few months. “At the root of the crisis was an intertwined agrarian and urban crisis. Our cities are becoming more and more exclusionary…one response is to think about rental housing and other urban social-welfare programs that can provide some safety nets for informal workers in cities,” said Balakrishnan.Of course, this doesn’t even touch the strain put on workers who spend months away from their families, the mental health impact of being poorly paid and working in inhospitable conditions and the growing desperation of vulnerable labourers who are women or come from marginalised castes, and are now pitted against each other for meagre rural resources in a ravaged rural economy.“There are pressure points emerging all over. We cannot get back to the old system,” said Pani.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/the-tragic-lessons-of-covid-migrant-crisis-101616529601176.html
24-03-2021||India||Days later, four more held with second elephant tusk in Uttarakhand||A joint team of special task force (STF), wildlife crime control bureau and forest department officials on Tuesday arrested four people and recovered an elephant tusk from their possession in Rudrapur area in US Nagar district. This second tusk belongs to the same elephant whose first tusk was recovered from four people held on March 17. Later after questioning the four accused, the carcass of the elephant was spotted at Peepal Parao forest range of Terai Central forest division said officials. Abhilasha Singh, divisional forest officer of Terai Central forest division said acting on a tip-off, a joint team of STF and forest department officials conducted an operation on Rampur road at UP border in Rudrapur area on Tuesday and arrested the four men. “We recovered an elephant’s tusk from them. We also seized a vehicle in which the accused were travelling. The tusk can fetch up to ₹1 crore in the international market,” she said. Abhilasha Singh further said, “This tusk belongs to the same elephant whose tusk was recovered from the four people arrested last week. After the elephant’s carcass was recovered from the Peepal Parao forest range, its second tusk was found to be missing. Since then, we were looking for it.” She said the accused have been identified as Karnail Singh—a resident of Gadarpur, Raju, a resident of Rampur, Ravindra Singh—a resident of Swar Rampur and Kishan Singh, a resident of Lalkuan, Nainital. The four accused are being questioned on how they got this tusk and where they were going to sell it. They are also being questioned on whether they are a part of any wildlife racket, she added. “We have registered a case against the accused under relevant sections of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/days-later-four-more-held-with-second-elephant-tusk-in-uttarakhand-101616529899264.html
24-03-2021||India||Covid curbs changed the way India lives||It has now been a year since India announced the start of a hard lockdown to slow the rate of Covid-19 infections. For many across the country, March 24 marks the one-year anniversary of the start of an entirely new way of life. A year that will likely go down as the toughest in the lives of many, and one that will mark lifestyle changes that may even end up being permanent.To understand how a nationwide lockdown changed behavioural patterns across the country, Google in April 2020 started publishing Covid-19 “Community Mobility Reports” to provide insights into what has changed in the lives of people with new policies in place for work from home, shelter in place, and shutdown of recreation centres such as malls and cinema halls. The reports used aggregated data to chart movement trends over time across different categories of places such as retail and recreation, groceries and pharmacies, parks, transit stations, workplaces, and residential areas, spread across a wide variety of geographies.This data, shared publicly by Google, enables us to understand how a year of lockdown may have permanently altered recurring aspects of our daily lives, such as going to office five days a week, that have been commonplace since as far back as the Industrial Revolution.To calculate each day’s baseline of activity/mobility, Google took the median day-value from the five-week period in January 2020 (January 3 to February 6). The data must be looked at keeping in mind local events and seasonal changes that might bias the findings, such as public holidays or drop in daytime activity during peak summer.To be sure, Google’s calculations are based on data from users who have opted in for “location history” to be shared for their Google accounts, so that the data represents a sample of people using devices that have Google’s Andriod OS. As with all samples, this may or may not represent the exact behaviour of a wider population, but tends to serve as a good example of larger trends of movement in a country such as India with millions of Android users.WORST HIT: SHOPPING AND RECREATIONThe retail and recreation category refers to mobility data at places such as restaurants, cafés, shopping centres, theme parks, museums, libraries, and cinemas. This category was not only the sector that was most affected by the lockdown in the country initially; it is also the sector that has seen the least activity even in recent weeks. At its worst, activity and mobility in this category dropped 87% (towards the middle of April). Even though restrictions have largely been lifted at restaurants, cinemas, malls etc., this sector remains the one that has recovered the least from the lockdown. In the past week, activity at retail and recreation centres remained 21% below baseline levels.The lockdown impact gets further emphasised when looking only at metros. Mumbai and Chennai, in particular, appear to have recovered the least. The mobility trend in Mumbai dropped by 94% during peak lockdown, while in Chennai it fell 97%. In the past week, activity has far from resumed to normal levels – in Mumbai, activity remains 41.6% below baseline, while in Chennai, Kolkata and Bengaluru, it is around 30% below baseline. In Delhi, the fall is 27%.LEAST HIT: GROCERY AND PHARMACYAt the other end of the spectrum, the least affected category from the lockdown was grocery and pharmacy. At its worst, when the nationwide lockdown was kicked off in the final week of March, activity in the field dropped 64% from baseline. Since then, this essential sector was not only the one with the fastest recovery, but also the one that saw a significant improvement over baseline levels. In the past week, activity at supermarket and pharmacy outlets across India was nearly 20% above levels considered normal.In terms of metros though, this recovery appears to have been rather sedated – in the past week, mobility at shops has increased around 5% above baseline in Mumbai and Chennai, while it is only 3.5% in Delhi and 1.4% in Bengaluru. Kolkata, meanwhile, is yet to even recover in this field – the city remains 9.4% below baseline levels.WORKPLACE SHIFT PERMANENT? Another interesting sector to look at is workplaces and offices, as it is possibly the one that has suffered the most long-lasting changes due to the lockdown, both in India and globally. Work from home, commonly abbreviated as WFH, has become common parlance across the globe since lockdowns forced most organisations to shift their employees to work remotely. This was also, unsurprisingly, the second quickest sector to start its recovery (it was rising fast by mid-April), behind only grocery and pharmacy. During peak lockdown, movement at offices across India dropped as low as 72% from baseline, but as of last week, it has remains only 15% below baseline nationally.There are two interesting points to note from this sector, however.First, while recovery was fast in this field initially, it tapered off towards October, and has been inching relatively slowly since. Several sectors that were behind, such as transit stations and parks, are now ahead. This may be a sign that the WFH shift may have moved the baseline permanently (or at least for the near future) to significantly lower than what it was in 2020.Second, Bengaluru remains the city with the largest drop from baseline – the city is still nearly 40% below the January 2020 baseline, while other metros are in the 20% drop range (the national average is higher still at -15%). This may be because the city is home to the Silicon Valley of India, and the IT firms in the city could implement remote working far more effectively than non-IT sector companies located in other metros.OTHER SECTORS The category of transit stations includes movement at places that are public transport hubs, such as Metro rail, bus and train stations. This was the field that saw the second fastest recovery across the country – in the past week, activity at transit hubs is only 5% below normal levels across India. This is a crucial indicator of how mobility, in a wider sense of the word, is nearly back to normal. This field has made a steady recovery since March last year.Residential movement, meanwhile, was the only category which understandably saw a positive reaction to the lockdown as more people were confined to their homes than usual. Starting with the lockdown, activity levels at homes remained in the +30% zone till mid-May (the period that saw the hardest level of lockdown in the country). Even in the last week, activity remains slightly above baseline levels in all metros, as well as the national average, which may be a knock-on effect of the WFH impact on activity at workplaces.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-curbs-changed-the-way-india-lives-101616529595314.html
24-03-2021||India||City holds events in memory of Bhagat Singh on Martyr’s Day||While the Delhi government organised cultural programmes on revolutionary freedom fighter Bhagat Singh on Tuesday, to mark his death anniversary (also observed as Martyr’s Day in the country), the farmers at Delhi borders drew parallels between the current agitation and the freedom struggle, and a Delhi college invited people to attend an Urdu storytelling (dastangoi) session on the revolutionary leader, to pay homage to the iconic leader.On March 23, 1931, three freedom fighters Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev Thapar, and Shivaram Rajguru were executed by the British for “conspiring against the Crown”.The Delhi government also organised a Shaheed Diwas function in Connaught Place on Tuesday to commemorate the contributions of Singh to the freedom struggle. HT had earlier reported how the Delhi Archives was putting up photo galleries and a light and sound show at Central Park to mark the day.“Through this light and sound show, I want all of you to become familiar with patriots such as Shaheed Bhagat Singh. During India’s freedom movement, there were two schools of thought. One, which used to appease the British rulers for their own benefits and was against the growth of India and, two, which wanted equal rights and freedom for all,” said Delhi minister Gopal Rai.“Today, the British are gone, but there is another type of autocratic power in India. Today, we have a government that puts nails in front of farmers and is scared of students, farmers, labourers and others. We need to learn from Shaheed Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, Rajguru and others on how we can fight against an arrogant and autocratic power,” he said.The farmers at Delhi borders marked the day at the protest sites in Singhu, Tikri, and Ghazipur. “Women leaders from Haryana reminded us of how Singh had warned us that the country would not get freedom only by the British leaving the country; that this country would be truly independent only when the exploitation of farmers and labourers ends,” said Harmeet Singh Kadiyan, a member of Samyukta Kisan Morcha.Soil was collected from historical places associated with martyrs -- Sunam, Khatkadkalan, Shri Anandpur Sahib, Shri Fatehgarh Sahib, Sarabha, Jallianwala Bagh, Hussainiwala, Shri Chamkaur Sahib -- and brought to Singhu and Tikri borders.Union education minister Ramesh Pokhriyal ‘Nishank’ also paid homage to freedom fighters at an event organised by Delhi University. Singh was imprisoned for a day in the basement of DU’s Vice Regal Lodge.“The University of Delhi opened a library and a research centre in the same room where the writings of Shaheed Bhagat Singh and works of scholars on him are displayed,” Pokhriyal said, stressing on the need of more events that instil pride among youngsters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/city-holds-events-in-memory-of-bhagat-singh-on-martyr-s-day-101616525280084.html
24-03-2021||India||Daily cases surge past 1,000 as experts call for stricter enforcement of Covid norms||The number of new Covid-19 cases in Delhi surged past the 1,000-mark on Tuesday, with the city reporting 1,101 viral infections. This is also the first time that the city has recorded a four digit tally of daily cases, since December 20 last year — when 1,091 new cases had been reported.Tuesday’s daily tally was also the highest single day surge in number of cases that the city has seen since December 19 last year, when 1,139 new infections had been detected, according to daily data released by the Delhi government.The uptick in number of cases comes even as the Delhi government is looking to expand its ongoing vaccination drive in order to prevent a new wave of the disease surging through the city. The Delhi government has increased the number of vaccination sites and directed its centres to remain open for 12 hours from March 22 (Monday) onwards. On Tuesday, the Union government also announced that the vaccination drive will now be open for anyone over the age of 45 years even without comorbidities, even as the Delhi government asked the Centre to do away with the age cut-off altogether for people getting the jabs.Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain in a tweet said, “The central government has allowed vaccination for everyone over the age of 45 years. The Delhi government has gone a step further and asked the Central government to allow everyone over the age of 18 years to get the vaccine. This will be an example not only for the country but for the entire world in beating Covid-19.”On Tuesday, Delhi’s positivity rate — proportion of samples that return positive among the total tested — dipped slightly to 1.31% as compared to 1.32% recorded a day earlier. This was largely owing to 84,237 samples being tested on Monday — reported a day later in the health bulletin — as compared to 67,418 tests conducted on Sunday.“There was euphoria among people when the number of infections in the city went down. With over 50% of the population exposed to the infection, the transmission had slowed down. But, people gathering for events, such as weddings, has again led to an increase. This is exactly what happened after Dussehra and Diwali,” said Dr GC Khilnani, former head of the department of pulmonary medicine at All India Institute of Medical Sciences and chairman of PSRI Institute of Pulmonary and Critical care.Dr Jugal Kishore, head of the department of community medicine at Safdarjung hospital said, “I am expecting the number of cases to increase two or three times, because people are not following Covid appropriate behaviour. People became complacent as the number of cases had come down. They thought that Covid is like any other infection. And then there is the vaccine euphoria.”He added, “However, now to control the number of cases, there is a need for the government to strictly enforce certain restrictions, such as wearing masks in public. A local lockdown does not help much, as the spread inside the area continues and further it disrupts the economy and society within. Instead, there is a need for more communication with the people urging them to follow Covid appropriate measures.”He also suggested vaccinating high risk categories, such as migrant workers, to slow down the transmission of the infection. So far, the city has immunised 324,654 people over the age of 60, 54,672 over the age of 45 with comorbidities, 281336 front line workers, and 185,527 health care workers. The turnout for the vaccination drive remained low on Tuesday — the second day of the expanded vaccination drive in Delhi — with only 33477 shots being administered. District officials say it was mainly due to the rain that kept people at home.Not only the cases, the number of deaths due to the viral infection has also seen an uptick since Monday when seven deaths had been reported. On Tuesday, the city recorded four deaths due to the viral infection.Just over 3 persons died of the infection each day on an average during the last seven days. In comparison, 2.4 people died each day for the two weeks before, and 1.1 on average each day the week before that, according to government data.The increase in the number of deaths is following the trajectory of the increase in the number of infections, experts say.“We have already started seeing an increase in the number of patients being admitted with severe disease over the last one week. The patients do not usually die on the very first day of admission; the severity of the infection peaks between the eight and 12th day. This means, if there is an increase in the number of cases today, the increase in the number of deaths will be seen only after ten days,” Dr Khilnani said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhis-daily-covid-19-cases-surge-past-1-000-experts-call-for-caution-101616525273131.html
24-03-2021||India||Caution not the keyword at Chandni Chowk market||Covid caution was thrown to the wind, as thousands flocked Chandni Chowk market on Monday ahead of Holi festivities, disregarding all social distancing norms and triggering fears of another outbreak of the virus in the city.A spot check by HT at the popular market in Old Delhi on Monday, found a majority of shoppers not wearing masks or wearing one improperly. Rampant violations of social distancing norms was also visible with the market being absolutely chock-a-block and no thermal screening happening at any of the entry points of the shopping hub, which is surrounded by congested residential neighbourhoods of Chandni Mahal, Ballimaran and Dariba Kalan, making it vulnerable to a “super-spreading” event. There were no announcements being made to caution people about Covid appropriate behaviour or asking them to follow social distancing norms and wear masks.There were only two civil defence volunteers deployed near Fountain Chowk, who were seen telling people to wear masks but their efforts clearly fell on mostly deaf ears.“We cannot challan everyone because of the excessive crowd. We can only advice them to wear masks and maintain a distance of two metres. However, maintaining social distancing in such a busy and crowded market is almost impossible,” one the civil defence volunteers said, requesting anonymity.Chandni Chowk is one of the busiest markets in the city and is a popular shopping hub for wedding clothes, readymade garments, wholesale trade of medicines and is also dotted with a number of famous eating joints.. According to traders, on any normal day, the market witnesses a footfall of around two to three lakh people per day. Chandni ChowkPriya Mishra (28), a shopper said, “Hassle-free shopping is a dream here. No social distancing is being followed anywhere. Since the wedding season is going to start, more people are thronging the market as this is a hub for wedding clothes. The authorities should at least make announcements to remind visitors about wearing masks and maintain necessary distance between themselves, while shopping.”Unauthorised hawkers and cycle rickshaws on the stretch were seen occupying road space and had a rush of visitors around them.Market associations in Chandni Chowk have issued directions to shopkeepers to not allow anyone without masks inside their shops and also to sanitise their hands before entering their establishments. Representatives of market association said they would write to the district administration to enhance vigil in the market area to ensure safety of shoppers as well as traders.“The crowd has increased in the market because of Holi, but we have to be careful about the virus. So we have issued strict guidelines to shopkeepers stating no one without a mask be allowed inside shops and they should be thermal screened. In a day or two, we are going to write to the district magistrate about violations of Covid-19 in the market by shoppers and request an increase in vigil and deployment of more teams to strictly enforce social distancing norms,” Sanjay Bhargava, president Chandni Chowk Sarva Vyapar Mandal, said.He also said that “unauthorised vendors” on streets and lanes in the busy market were adding to the virus spread scare.Similar concerns were echoed by other traders of the market.Puneet Chadha, who owns a garment store in Chandni Chowk, said that the number of hawkers have increased because Holi is round the corner.“We conduct thermal screening of every visitor and sanitise their hands at the entrance of our shops. But these rules are not being followed by roadside vendors. The authorities should ensure that they also follow Covid-19 guidelines,” Chadha said.Similar chaotic situation prevailed at Bhagirath Place Market, which is a part of Chandni Chowk market and is known for wholesale business of medicines.Ashish Grover, general secretary Delhi Drug Traders Association Bhagirath Place, said that along with authorities, the public should also act responsibly and adhere to Covid-19 appropriate behaviour. “We have distributed nearly 6,000 kits containing sanitisers, disinfectants, masks and gloves to traders in Chandni Chowk and instructed them to not allow anyone without masks including their own staff. People should not wait for authorities to issue challans to wear masks.They should understand the gravity of the situation and follow social distancing,” Grover said.District administration authorities, however, said that all necessary steps were being taken to check spread of Covid-19 in the area.Akriti Sagar, district magistrate (central) said that continuous monitoring was happening in the entire district, including the Chandni Chowk market. “Every day we are issuing 100-150 challans against violators. We have recently conducted meetings with market associations in Chandni Chowk and appealed them to ensure that their staff and shoppers follow Covid-19 appropriate behaviour,” Sagar said.Dr GC Khilnani, chairman of the PSRI institute of Pulmonary, Critical care and Sleep medicine, said that that there was a definite surge in Delhi. He said that there is need to follow Covid-19 guidelines. “There has been an uptick in cases in the last 15-20 days. People should not be complacent,” he said.Deputy commissioner of police (north) Anto Alphonse said, “Our teams are imposing fine on those found loitering without mask, spitting, or not adhering to government’s COVID safety protocols. We have also placed barricades to keep distance between the crowds visiting the market. Regular announcements are also being made asking people to wear masks at all times when they are out in public,” Alphonse said.The DCP said they have also held meetings with market welfare associations to make sure that every shopkeeper ensures that the norms are also being followed by visitors to their shops. “Watch is being kept through CCTV footages and wherever overcrowding is noticed, staff I sent to disperse people,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/caution-not-the-keyword-at-chandni-chowk-market-101616525233405.html
24-03-2021||India||81% of samples in Punjab confirm UK variant||Chandigarh: Of the 401 samples sent for genome sequencing from across Punjab, 81% turned up positive for the new UK Covid variant B.1.1.7 in the state on Monday. These random samples were collected from various containment zones with high Covid-19 cases from all districts of Punjab between March 1 and 10. They were sent to a virology lab in Pune. In January, the state health department sent 478 Covid-19 positive samples to National Institute of Biologicals (NIB), Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (IGIB), Delhi, and the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), for genome sequencing, of which results of 90 samples were received. Of those, only two samples were positive for N440K variant, also known as ‘Kerala’ strain. State health experts said ‘Kerala’ strain was the mutated strain of the virus spread in India. In last week of February, a team from the ministry of health and family welfare, Government of India, visited Punjab to review the increase in positivity. The team was informed about the pending results of genome sequencing. Thereafter, 401 more samples, collected between March 1and March 10, 2021, were sent to NCDC for genome sequencing. The results on Monday were worrying as they showed the presence of the B.1.1.7 variant in 326 samples. The presence of UK strain was found in 12 districts of Punjab, including SAS Nagar, Jalandhar, Patiala, Kapurthala, SBS Nagar, Hoshiarpur, Gurdaspur, Amritsar, Ludhiana, Ropar, Bathinda and Taran Taran. What does presence of UK variant mean? “Such a high presence of UK strain is worrying as these samples were taken from all districts. This new strain is 70% more infectious than the older virus and that is why the speed of the spread is more in the second wave,” said Dr K.K Talwar, former director, PGIMER Chandigarh, and head of the state government’s Covid management group. Stating that the new strain spread faster, Dr Talwar said that is why more young population and those going out for the job were getting infected in the second wave. Notably, health department’s internal analysis, already reported by HT, has found that nearly two-thirds of Covid-19 patients in Punjab are aged between 20 and 60 (working-age population). The trend suggests that people in the age bracket have a high rate of mobility as they have to venture out of their homes for work or other purposes. The figures also show that those aged between 31 and 40 are the most vulnerable to contracting the virus, with 17.2% of the total cases falling in the category. Punjab’s active cases on Tuesday reached 19,423 with new infections in the last one week growing at an average of 1.1% every day. In September last year, when the state witnessed peak in the first wave, maximum active cases in the state was 22,778, as reported on September 22. Talwar said in such a scenario only increase in vaccination and less movement of people can control the situation. CM appeals PM to widen vaccination ambit While disclosing the news about presence of the UK strain in large number of samples in Punjab, chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh appealed to people to get themselves vaccinated and urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to widen the vaccination ambit to cover those younger than 60. However, later in the day when the Centre issued new guidelines making everyone above 45 eligible for vaccination, the chief minister took to Twitter to thank the Centre for responding to his request.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/81-of-samples-in-punjab-confirm-ukvariant-101616525937795.html
24-03-2021||India||Nuns’ detention in UP fans Kerala poll furore||Thiruvananthapuram: The brief detention of a group of nuns by Government Railway Police (GRP) following complaints of alleged forced conversion by Bajrang Dal activists in Uttar Pradesh’s Jhansi district has generated a political firestorm in Kerala ahead of the crucial assembly elections next month.The nuns’ congregation belongs to Syro-Malabar Church which is based in Kerala. While the Kerala Catholic Bishops Conference (KCBC) and Syro-Malabar Church have sought action against the activists, opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala rushed a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi demanding immediate action in the case. The incident occurred at a time when the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is wooing Christian minorities who form 16 per cent of the votebank to get a foothold in the central Travancore area. In a detailed statement, the church media commission said that the nuns and a group of girls were on their way from Delhi to Odisha in a train on March 19 for Easter celebrations when they were confronted by the Bajrang Dal activists in Jhansi. The church claimed that the nuns were verbally abused and activists tried to attack the girls, whom they believed, were being taken away for religious conversion.“They did not believe nuns’ words that all were born Christians and continued to question them. Later, the nuns were taken into police custody at Jhansi after they alerted the railway police. They were threatened and terrorised by the right wing workers,” Father Jerry Joseph, spokesperson of the commission, said. He added that the nuns were released after three hours of questioning and transferred to the Bishop’s House in Jhansi.“It was a terrifying incident. They were not even considerate towards the women. Around 150 Bajrang Dal activists surrounded us and behaved as though we were criminals,” one of the nuns said, preferring anonymity.“It is totally unacceptable. Thousands of nuns and priests are engaged in humanitarian activities across the country. We want a high-level intervention,” KCBC said.Sunil Singh, SHO and GRP, Jhansi, said the nuns and girls were deboarded after the activists suspected that the girls were being taken away for religious conversion. “The police investigated and found no such thing. The nuns and students were later sent with a reverend,” he said.The leaders from the church also plan to meet Union Home Minister Amit Shah, who is arriving in the state on Wednesday for campaigning, in this regard. In his letter to Modi, Chennithala said: “It is a serious incident. Poor nuns were terrorised and attacked. The government will have to ensure speedy justice to them.” The ruling CPI(M) also condemned the incident. “It exposes intolerance towards minority communities in north India,” the party said in a statement. The state BJP sent a letter to Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on the matter. “The party condemns the incident. It seems the police also took hasty action without verifying the facts. We want action against the perpetrators and police officials who detained the nuns,” party vice president George Kurian said in his letter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nuns-detention-in-up-fans-kerala-poll-furore-101616525877951.html
24-03-2021||India||BJP fields ex-CEA from another seat after row||Kolkata: The Bharatiya Janata Party on Tuesday fielded former chief economic advisor Ashok Lahiri as its Balurghat candidate for the upcoming West Bengal assembly polls after party workers protested his candidature from Alipurduar constituency seeking the nomination of a local leader.Actor Mithun Chakraborty, who recently joined the BJP, has not been fielded for the elections.The party named 11 candidates in its final list for the elections and changed its nominees in two other constituencies. The BJP has now named all 294 candidates for the eight-phase polls, set to begin on March 27. In a list released last week, the BJP named Lahiri as its Alipurduar candidate. After protests, he was replaced with Suman Kanjilal. Speaking to news agency PTI on Tuesday, the former CEA said, “I had left West Bengal in 1971 (when the Naxal movement was at its peak in the state) as the situation here was not conducive for studies, but I was always mentally present in Bengal... I always had the feeling that I needed to get back to my roots and do some work here.”The party also named retired Lt Gen Subrata Saha, former deputy chief of army staff, from Rashbehari in South Kolkata. The list put an end to speculations that Mithun Chakraborty, a former superstar in Bollywood and an icon in Bengal, might be the BJP’s chief ministerial face in the assembly polls. While he registered himself as a voter in North Kolkata on Monday, he was not named a candidate for the polls.“If the BJP wants it can field Chakraborty in a by-election later on. In 2011 when the TMC came to power Mamata Banerjee did the same thing. She won the Bhowanipore constituency in a by-election,” said Amal Mukhopadhyay, political commentator. The BJP also fielded new candidates from Chowranghee and Kashipur-Belgachia seats, after the initial nominees – Sikha Mitra and Tarun Saha—refused to contest polls last week.From Chowranghee, the BJP has fielded Debabrata Majhi, replacing Sikha, wife of former state Congress chief Somen Mitra. The party’s district unit president Shibaji Singha Roy has replaced Saha, husband of TMC MLA Mala Saha, in Kashipur-Belgachia. “Mitra and Saha had refused to contest the polls and hence had to be replaced. Later the party’s central election committee decided to field separate candidates. There may have been some communication gap and the party is looking into it,” said a senior BJP leader, requesting anonymity.The party namedtwo Matua community candidates -- Subrata Thakur from Gaighata and Ashok Kirtonia from Bangaon Uttar, both in North 24 Parganas. Thakur is the grandson of Matua leader Binapani Devi and the son of former TMC leader Manjul Krishna Thakur. The Matua population is estimated at 50 million, of which about 30 million are in West Bengal alone and 15 million are listed as voters. The state’s Matua strongholds including parts of 24 North Parganas, Nadia, Cooch Behar, Dinajpur and Burdwan, have become the centre of a struggle for control between the ruling Trinamool Congress and the BJP. After the BJP’s announcement, the ruling TMC said that the party was politically bankrupt. “The BJP may field anyone from anywhere, but their defeat is imminent. Infighting has broken out within the party over selection of candidates. That the BJP is politically bankrupt and has no proper leaders in Bengal, has been proved as it had to bring in its central leaders and MPs to fight assembly polls,” TMC spokesperson Kunal Ghosh said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-fields-ex-cea-from-another-seat-after-row-101616525877287.html
24-03-2021||India||Vaze the mastermind, will seek his custody, says Maha ATS chief||Mumbai: Maharashtra Anti-Terrorism Squad chief Jaijeet Singh on Tuesday said that suspended police officer Sachin Vaze was a “prime accused” in the Mansukh Hiran murder case, adding that the investigating agency has procured a transfer warrant from a Thane court with which it will approach the special National Investigation Agency (NIA) court seeking his custody.Vaze is in custody of NIA till March 25 for allegedly planting an SUV filled with explosives outside industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s residence last month. Hiran, a Thane-based auto spare parts dealer who was linked to the car, was found dead at the Reti Bunder Creek on March 5.Speaking to reporters at a press conference outside the agency’s office in south Mumbai, Singh said that more arrests were likely in the case.“Accused in the said crime, Sachin Vaze is in the custody of the National Investigation Agency till March 25. Since, it is necessary to thoroughly interrogate him in connection with the crime, a transfer warrant has been obtained from the Chief Judicial Magistrate at Thane and a comprehensive application has been filed before the Special NIA court at Mumbai. We are sure that after thoroughly interrogating him, the ATS team will get to the bottom of the crime and unearth the conspiracy,” Singh said. ATS on March 21 arrested two men, Vinayak Shinde, a convicted constable on parole in an encounter case, and bookie Naresh Gor in the murder of the 48-year-old spare parts dealer, who was in possession of the SUV, and which he reported stolen before it was found parked outside billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s Antilia residence last month containing 20 loose sticks of gelatin and a threatening letter addressed to the businessman and his wife.“It has come to light in the investigation that some of the 14 SIM cards obtained through accused Naresh Gor were activated and given to Vinayak Shinde, and Shinde in turn transferred the activated SIM cards to others involved in the crime and the SIM cards were used in commission of the said crime. Preliminary investigation has revealed that some of the SIM cards used in commission of the crime and some of the mobile handsets in which those SIM cards were used, were destroyed by the accused,” Singh said.The probe agency also claimed to have detained a person from Ahmedabad who allegedly provided SIM cards to the accused.ATS interrogated Vaze on March 8, following a statement by Vimla, Hiran’s wife, accusing the suspended cop of having a hand in her husband’s death.Her statement also revealed that Vaze and Hiran knew each other well and that Vaze had borrowed the Scorpio that was later found outside Antilia, for four months between November 2020 and February 2021. He returned it to Hiran in early February. Hiran reported the car stolen on February 18.Following Vimla’s statement, ATS registered a case of murder against unknown persons.“In interrogation, Vaze refuted all the allegations leveled against him. He claimed that the vehicle in question (Mahindra Scorpio) had never been in his possession and also maintained that he had nothing to do with the deceased. He denied having any involvement in the said crime and that he had no knowledge about the said crime. But ATS officials have collected evidence showing that the claims made by Vaze are false and further probe is on to find out his exact involvement in the said crime,” Singh said.The ATS chief said that it was Vaze who contacted Shinde when the latter walked out of jail on parole last year and took his help, he said.According to ATS, Shinde contacted Hiran, posing as “Tawde saab from Mumbai crime branch”on the evening of March 4, the day before Hiran’s body was found in a Thane creek.“Preliminary investigation suggests that Shinde along with others was involved. A Volvo car seized from Daman is suspected to have been used in the crime,” the ATS chief said.The Forensic Science Laboratory at Kalina in Mumbai examined the car on Tuesday, he added.A team of five forensic officers from Pune also visited Thane on Tuesday afternoon along with ATS officials. The forensic team examined the blue coloured Volvo seized by ATS. The officials refused to talk but collected several samples from the car for over two hours. “The team did not find any documents or equipments in the car. They were collecting fingerprints, footprints and any other forensic evidence which will help in the investigation,” an official said.  ATS has also obtained CCTV footage from various spots even though the accused destroyed some CCTV footage in a bid to destroy evidence of their movement, officials said.“To understand how exactly the crime was committed, a demonstration was conducted by taking the arrested accused at the crime scene. Analysis of the information collected by raiding the residences, offices and godowns of the arrested accused is going on,” Singh said.Meanwhile, NIA is also conducting a parallel probe in the Hiran murder case as well as the explosives case. A team searched the premises of a room in Trident hotel, where Vaze reportedly stayed between February 16 and 20. According to a senior NIA officer, CCTV footage from the hotel shows Vaze entering with five bags. The bags are yet to be recovered, this officer added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vaze-the-mastermind-will-seek-his-custody-says-maha-ats-chief-101616525818526.html
24-03-2021||India||BJP promises corrected NRC to protect ‘genuine’ Indian citizens||GUWAHATIThe Bharatiya Janata Party on Tuesday promised to initiate the process of correcting the National Register of Citizens (NRC) to “protect genuine Indian citizens and exclude all illegal immigrants” as part of its manifesto for the poll-bound Assam. Releasing the party’s manifesto, BJP president JP Nadda announced 10 commitments for an ‘Atmanirbhar Assam’ in the presence of chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal and other party leaders. “Assam was full of problems five years ago, but our government has been able to address some of them by providing inclusive development. We have gained momentum and are now ready to take a big leap in coming years. Besides the 10 commitments, we will work on improving connectivity, health, education, women empowerment etc and take Assam to newer heights,” Nadda said. The BJP is committed to protect and preserve the “identity and culture” of Assam, keeping the “natural process of cultural change intact”, Nadda said. The updated NRC for Assam, released in August 2019, excluded 1.9 million of the nearly 33 million applicants. Calling the list faulty, the BJP said that the names of many genuine citizens were left out. The NRC is yet to be notified. The document comes days after the release of Congress’s manifesto, which included five guarantees such as ₹2,000 monthly to housewives, 200 units of free electricity to all households, an increase in daily wages of tea garden workers to ₹365, and the creation of 500,000 government jobs. The Congress has said that if voted to power, it will not implement the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) passed in 2019 to fast-track the citizenship process for non-Muslims from Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Afghanistan.The CAA triggered protests in Assam amid fears that it could dilute the 1985 Assam Accord and lead to a fresh influx of Bangladeshi Hindus. The accord provided for the deportation of all refugees and migrants, who have entered Assam after March 25, 1971. The CAA extends the deadline until December 31, 2014.The BJP has promised to implement CAA in poll-bound West Bengal but has not included the issue in its commitments to Assam’s voters.“CAA has been passed by parliament and it will be implemented. I should not question Congress’s ideology or intellect, but how can central legislation passed by parliament get changed by a state legislation? Either Congress leaders are ignorant about it or they are cheating people of Assam and both of it are detrimental to the state,” Nadda told mediapersons. On the implementation of the clause six of the Assam Accord, Nadda said, “it is under process and we are committed to it”. The party also promised to speed up the process of delimitation in the state to protect the rights of the people indigenous to the state. The BJP president said the party is committed to strengthening and scientific management of international borders. “Border management is a continuous process and we will continue to improve it,” he said.Under the state government’s Orunudoi scheme, the BJP has committed to enhance payments to women to ₹3,000 a month from the existing ₹830 for economic empowerment and extend the scheme to cover 3 million families in the state.“As part of Mission Shishu Unnayan we will aim to provide quality education to children. This commitment includes free education in all government schools and free bicycles to all girl students from Class 8 and above,” said Nadda. The party also promised that Assam will be freed from the vagaries of flood by launching “Mission Brahmaputra” with a multi-pronged strategy involving the dredging of rivers and building reservoirs to store excess water from Brahmaputra and its tributaries.The party announced setting up of a task force to recover lands of Sattras (Vaishnav monastery) and places of worship from illegal encroachment and strengthen all Namghars (prayer halls) and places of worship of the tribals in the state by providing grants of up to ₹2.5 lakh each.The BJP president again targeted the Congress for forming an alliance with Badruddin Ajmal’s All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF). Assam’s identity is inextricably linked to Vaishanav saint Srimanta Sankardeva, Bharat Ratnas Dr Bhupen Hazarika and Gopinath Bordoloi and “now can we allow it to be linked with Badruddin Ajmal”, Nadda said.The party also stated that if voted to power again, it would introduce legislation to curb love jihad and land jihad. The manifesto did not give any details on what these legislations would entail. Love jihad is a term used by Hindu outfits to describe relationships between Muslim men and Hindu women. BJP governments in Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh recently enacted laws to check conversion for marriage through fraud, coercion or enticement.Last month, Assam minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said that the BJP manifesto for Assam would include action against land jihad, alleging that plots of land, including those belonging to monasteries, were being grabbed by a certain section of people. He said that the party would also bring in a policy mandating a prospective groom to disclose information like religion, employment details, income etc, before marriage.Reacting to the announcements, Congress media committee chairperson Bobbeeta Sharma said: “The BJP has failed miserably in giving the people of Assam a fool-proof NRC. Their sincerity in solving the illegal migrants’ issue is questionable. If they could not do in it the last five years, what is the guarantee that they will be able to do it in the next five years.” Political analysts said the BJP was trying to polarize voters through its election manifesto.“BJP’s manifesto for 2016 included substantive issues like doubling of farm output and implementation of Assam Accord in letter and spirit. Subsequently, when the party was in power, it shifted to launching many beneficiary schemes. From that they have now switched to talking about clash of civilisations and ways to protect Assam’s ‘sanskriti’. Perhaps, the party is not confident that it will win election with its work in the past five years. That’s why they are trying to polarize voters as a key strategy,” said Akhil Ranjan Dutta, professor of political science at Gauhati University. Assam goes to polls in three phases on March 27, April 1 and April 6; the votes will be counted on May 2.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-promises-corrected-nrc-to-protect-genuine-indian-citizens-101616525817385.html
24-03-2021||India||MVA didn’t act on evidence of scam in police dept: Fadnavis||: Leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis on Tuesday accused the ruling Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government of not acting on “incriminating evidence” supplied as a report by former Commissioner of State Intelligence Rashmi Shukla on a “money for transfer” scam in the state police department. HT has seen a copy of the report, dated August 25, 2020, which names senior politicians, middlemen and police officers, who allegedly sought transfers and postings of their liking.The report, which is based on intercepted phone calls of six people -- it was not immediately clear if this was done through proper channels -- states that they were middlemen who helped police officials seek postings of their choice, and brought up names of politicians such as Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar and home minister Anil Deshmukh, in their alleged conversations.The report does not state that the middlemen spoke to these leaders directly. It contends that one middlemen is an assistant in the home minister’s office.The report does not talk about any direct transfer of money to these politicians. It does, however, refer to “monetary exchange” between police officers and middlemen acting in close connection with politicians. There was no reaction from chief minister’s office to the report. Deshmukh was not available for comments.In a press conference held in Mumbai on Tuesday, Fadnavis said Shukla submitted the report to the then Director General of Police Subodh Kumar Jaiswal on August 25, 2020, who in turn forwarded the report to Sitaram Kunte, the then additional chief secretary, home, the following day. Fadnavis met the Union home secretary in Delhi and demanded a CBI probe. “The Union home secretary clearly told me that they will verify the documents and evidence and a report will be submitted to the central government. The government will take appropriate action accordingly,” he told reporters in the national capital.Fadnavis said that he had 6.3GB of data from the intercepted calls, which contained the voices of police officers and politicians closely related to the home minister and home department.While Fadnavis said Shukla had “sought proper permissions from then additional chief secretary-home and intercepted phone calls of several police officials and politician”, NCP spokesperson and state minister Nawab Malik said on Tuesday that Shukla had intercepted calls illegally.“She prepared the call records illegally hence she was transferred as a punishment,” Malik said. He added that “80% of the transfers mentioned in the report did not take place.”The State Intelligence Department (SID) is a sensitive wing of the police and it is a serious issue if communication between its chief and a DGP came out in the open, Maharashtra NCP chief and minister Jayant Patil said on Tuesday.A question also arises about how the previous BJP-led government used the SID, Patil said. “On whose directions was the phone tapping done? Who had given the right to (then Commissioner of Intelligence) Rashmi Shukla to tap the phones? Was permission to tap phones taken? All this needs to be investigated,” he said.The report names police officers who were in touch with six middlemen for transfers to desired posts. “It is a serious matter and necessitates urgent action by the state government. It is recommended that this be brought to the notice of Hon. Chief Minister at the earliest and an immediate and comprehensive enquiry by State CID (Crime), Pune be ordered to identify concerned individuals and take necessary legal action. It is also advised that the secrecy of this report be ensured, in order to prevent unnecessary scrutiny, which may bring disrepute to the government,” Jaiswal wrote in the covering letter when he submitted the report to ACS, Home.The report cited an instance of an IPS officer who wanted to be posted in Nashik. The report said that the officer met deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, environment minister Aaditya Thackeray, home minister Anil Deshmukh. He also met NCP chief Sharad Pawar along with a few local MLAs belonging to the Congress and the NCP. “Since Nashik has a sitting Shiv Sena MLA, Ajit Pawar suggested the transfer will need the approval from chief minister Uddhav Thackeray. As suggested by Ajit Pawar, the DCP met Sharad Pawar at his Nariman Point office. In turn, Pawar sent a message to Thackeray on WhatsApp. The DCP will get his desired posting done for sure,” the report stated, quoting the conversation from the intercepted calls of the middleman.There was no mention in the report of any money changing hands, or an any explicit impropriety in the transfer.In the summary to the report, Shukla wrote: “The aforesaid brokers were in close contacts and embroiled in these negotiations with several influential and the police officers ranging from inspectors to several high-ranking officers are in contact with such undesirable individuals. The information obtained and evidence collected is highly incriminating and gravely implicates a number of individuals engaged in this activity.”Malik, however, said on Tuesday that the transfer of policemen was a procedural affair and did not occur as mentioned in the report. Shukla, who is on central deputation, did not respond to the phone calls or text messages.A delegation of BJP leaders including Fadnavis, state unit chief Chandrakant Patil, Sudhir Mungantiwar and Ashish Shelar will meet Maharashtra governor BS Koshyari on Wednesday. “We want governor Koshyari to seek a detailed status report from the chief secretary of Maharashtra,” said a senior BJP leader.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mva-didn-t-act-on-evidence-of-scam-in-police-dept-fadnavis-101616525817960.html
24-03-2021||India||Army signs contract for 1.7 million medals||New DelhiSoldiers will no longer have to buy replicas of medals from the market, with the Indian Army on Tuesday announcing that it has concluded a contract for procuring 1.7 million medals.Soldiers are awarded medals for gallantry and distinguished service among other key landmarks in their military careers.Resolving a decade-old problem, the army said it has signed a contract for 17 different types of medals. “Integrated Headquarters of Ministry of Defence (Army) has concluded a contract for procurement of a total of 17.27 lakh service medals of 17 different types,” it said on Twitter.“The procurement has enabled Indian Army to meet all outstanding demands of service medals in respect of soldiers who have served and are serving in the Indian Army,” the army added. In contrast to original medals, the replica medals do not have the names of the soldiers and their service numbers engraved on them. For almost 10 years, soldiers have been purchasing medals from the market as the army grappled with the shortage.Soldiers could just approach shops selling service medals and buy them as per their requirement, an official familiar with the matter said. There was no need to produce any certificate to make the purchase.Gopinath Bazar in Delhi Cantt is a popular place for soldiers to buy replica medals. Other cantonments in the country also have shops that sell medals and other military items such as uniforms and boots. Soldiers and veterans wear these medals only during ceremonial functions. While there was no shortage of medals awarded to soldiers for gallantry, the defence ministry’s department of medals had failed to issue other varieties of medals, another official said on condition of anonymity.In 2016-17, the medals department was saddled with more than 1.4 million medals of various types. The soldiers, by default, are entitled to a variety of medals after completing a certain number of years in service, serving in difficult areas or taking part in various operations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/army-signs-contract-for-1-7-million-medals-101616525757265.html
24-03-2021||India||India abstains from key UNHRC vote on Lanka||New Delhi India on Tuesday abstained from a crucial vote at the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC) on Sri Lanka’s rights record, though New Delhi called on Colombo to carry forward the reconciliation process and address the aspirations of the Tamil minority. The 47-member UNHRC adopted a resolution – sponsored by a group of countries that includes the UK, Germany and Canada – which gives UN human rights chief Michelle Bachelet the mandate to collect and preserve evidence of crimes related to Sri Lanka’s civil war that ended in 2009 with the defeat of Tamil Tiger rebels. A total of 22 countries voted for the resolution that was very critical of Sri Lanka’s failure to address human rights violations that occurred during the civil war. The resolution also contended the human rights situation has deteriorated under the Rajapaksa administration and that rights defenders and ethnic and religious minorities are facing problems. Eleven countries, including Bangladesh, China and Pakistan, voted against the resolution, while 14 countries, including India, Indonesia, Japan and Nepal, abstained. In a statement before the voting on the resolution on “Promoting reconciliation, accountability and human rights in Sri Lanka”, Pawankumar Badhe, first secretary at India’s permanent mission in Geneva, said New Delhi believes states have the primary responsibility for protecting human rights. “We would urge the government of Sri Lanka to carry forward the process of reconciliation, address the aspirations of the Tamil community and continue to engage constructively with the international community to ensure that the fundamental freedoms and human rights of all its citizens are fully protected,” Badhe said. India’s approach to human rights in Sri Lanka, he said, was guided by “two fundamental considerations” – support to the Tamil minority for equality, justice, dignity and peace, and ensuring the unity, stability and territorial integrity of the island nation. “We have always believed that these two goals are mutually supportive and Sri Lanka’s progress is best assured by simultaneously addressing both objectives,” he added. India also supports the world community’s call for Sri Lanka to fulfil its commitments on devolution of political authority to the Tamils, including through early holding of elections to provincial councils and ensuring that these councils are able to operate effectively in line with the 13th amendment to Sri Lanka’s Constitution, Badhe said. India has traditionally shied away from backing direct UN intervention on human rights issues because of its sensitivities related to the Kashmir issue. At the same time, the Modi government has repeatedly pressed Sri Lanka to take steps to devolve powers to the Tamil minority and address their aspirations. The Tamil Nadu assembly election, to be held during April-May, is also believed to have been a factor behind India’s decision to abstain. The status of Sri Lanka’s Tamil minority is often a factor in Tamil Nadu’s politics. Though the Sri Lankan government reached out to India to vote against the resolution at the UNHRC, New Delhi has been irked with Colombo for reneging on a 2019 tripartite India-Japan-Sri Lanka agreement for developing the East Container Terminal at Colombo port. The Sri Lankan government scrapped the deal last month following pressure from labour unions and instead offered to develop the West Container Terminal with Indian and Japanese investors. Sri Lanka’s foreign minister Dinesh Gunawardena made a distinction while thanking countries that voted against the resolution or abstained. In a tweet, he appreciated “the support shown at Geneva” by countries such as India and Japan that abstained, and in another tweet, he extended a “very warm Thank You for solid support” shown by countries that voted against the resolution. While presenting the resolution at the UNHRC, British ambassador Julian Braithwaite said: “Impunity has become more entrenched, progress in emblematic cases has stalled.” But Sri Lankan ambassador MCA Chandraprema rejected the document as “unhelpful and divisive”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-abstains-from-key-unhrc-vote-on-lanka-101616525697868.html
24-03-2021||India||India legitimate partner in peace process: Afghan min||New Delhi Afghanistan envisages a greater role for India in building regional and international consensus for the country’s fraught peace process, though a decision on engaging the Taliban is entirely up to New Delhi, Afghan foreign minister Haneef Atmar said on Tuesday. Atmar is on a three-day visit to New Delhi, during which he held talks with his Indian counterpart S Jaishankar and National Security Adviser Ajit Doval on security and economic cooperation and collaboration on efforts to overcome the Covid-19 pandemic. The two sides also reviewed latest developments in the peace process between the Afghan government and the Taliban. During an interaction with the media, Atmar responded to a question on the role envisaged by the Afghan government for India in the peace process by saying that New Delhi has legitimate interests in the peace and stability of the region. “There are those out there that threaten not just Afghanistan but also India. So, India is a legitimate partner in peace-making and we are seeking a greater role for India in the process,” he said. Lasting peace in Afghanistan depends on national, regional and international consensus, irrespective of the venue where talks are held by the Afghan government and the Taliban, he said. India has a key role in the process of “regional and international consensus-building”, Atmar said. Atmar said he had not discussed India’s approach to the Taliban with his interlocutors. “We leave it entirely to India to make that decision. We’ve asked for a greater role by India in regional and international consensus-building and the mature policies pursued by the Indian government will always place emphasis on any kind of contact with the Taliban on condition that would serve the peace process – that they will be part of a legitimate government of Afghanistan,” he said. Both Afghanistan and India as well as the region have been affected by terrorism and the two countries have the responsibility to work together to defeat such threats, he said. The Afghan government is negotiating with the Taliban to make sure that the country doesn’t become a safe haven for international terrorists who could target India or the West, he said. “The best strategy to secure the world is to separate the Taliban from the regional and international terrorists, [and] make peace on the condition that Afghanistan remains a sovereign, peaceful, unified and independent country,” he said. Responding to a question about the targeting of Afghanistan’s Hindu and Sikh minorities by terrorists, he said: “The violence against Afghans didn’t spare our minorities either. So, it’s not a kind of persecution against [a] specific minority, it’s the general violence against the entire nation, in which this part of our population has been disproportionately affected.” He added it was the responsibility of the Afghan government to provide protection and security to the Hindu and Sikh minorities. Atmar also said the upcoming meeting between the Afghan government and the Taliban in Turkey on April 1 will focus on three issues – a permanent and comprehensive ceasefire, a political settlement consistent with a vision acceptable to the Afghan people, and regional and international guarantees for the settlement. “And in that political settlement, the key will be both sides agreeing to accept the free will of the Afghan people through elections,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-legitimate-partner-in-peace-process-afghan-min-101616525697278.html
24-03-2021||India||Atmosphere devoid of terror must for cordial ties, PM writes to Imran||New Delhi An atmosphere of trust, devoid of terror and hostility, is “imperative” for better relations between India and Pakistan, Prime Minister Narendra Modi told his Pakistani counterpart Imran Khan on Tuesday. The message was part of a letter of greetings send by Modi to Khan on the occasion of Pakistan Day. People familiar with developments, speaking on condition of anonymity, described the letter as a routine message sent to heads of government or state on national days. “As a neighbouring country, India desires cordial relations with the people of Pakistan. For this, an atmosphere of trust, devoid of terror and hostility, is imperative,” said the letter. The letter also referred to the impact of Covid-19 as a “difficult time for humanity”, and conveyed Modi’s best wishes to Khan and the people of Pakistan “for dealing with the challenges” of the pandemic. A separate message was sent by President Ram Nath Kovind to his Pakistani counterpart Arif Alvi, the people cited above said. After it emerged on Saturday that Khan had tested positive for Covid-19 and was self-isolating at home, Modi had tweeted: “Best wishes to Prime Minister @ImranKhanPTI for a speedy recovery from COVID-19.” Earlier on Tuesday, Pakistan’s chargé d’affaires Aftab Hasan Khan said his country desires friendly relations with all nations, including India, and the two sides should resolve all outstanding issues through dialogue. The diplomat made the remarks while addressing an event organised at the Pakistan high commission to mark Pakistan Day. The comments came against the backdrop of a thaw in bilateral relations after the armies of the two countries recommitted themselves to the 2003 ceasefire along the Line of Control (LoC) last month. “Pakistan wants to have friendly relations with all countries including India,” Aftab Hasan Khan said, according to a statement issued by the Pakistani mission. “To achieve peace between Pakistan and India, both countries shall resolve all outstanding issues including [Jammu and Kashmir] through dialogue,” he said. Peace within South Asia is “inevitable” for the larger interest of the region, he added. The chargé d’affaires spoke after raising the Pakistani flag at the brief ceremony with limited participation in view of the pandemic. Messages from the president and prime minister of Pakistan were also read out at the ceremony. Noting that Muslims under the leadership of Muhammad Ali Jinnah had made a resolve to create a separate homeland on March 23, 1940, the chargé d’affaires said the day is observed as Pakistan Day every year. The Indian and Pakistani high comissions in Islamabad and New Delhi are currently headed by the deputy chiefs of mission as Pakistan decided not to post an envoy in the Indian capital after Jammu and Kashmir’s special status was scrapped in August 2019. Pakistan also expelled the Indian envoy and downgraded diplomatic ties. The Indian and Pakistani armies began strictly adhering to the 2003 ceasefire on the LoC in Jammu and Kashmir from the midnight of February 24 – the apparent outcome of behind-the-scenes contacts between senior security officials of the two countries. Last week, Pakistan Army chief Gen Qamar Bajwa said the time has come for India and Pakistan to “bury the past and move forward”, though he cautioned that any peace process would be susceptible to disruption without the resolution of the Kashmir issue. Bajwa’s conciliatory remarks came a day after Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan said India will have to take the first step for improving bilateral ties by addressing Kashmir, the only issue standing in the way of better relations. The foreign ministers of India and Pakistan are set to participate in the ministerial meeting of the Heart of Asia-Istanbul Process in the Tajikistan capital of Dushanbe on March 30. However, it is still not clear whether they will hold a bilateral meeting in Dushanbe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/atmosphere-devoid-of-terror-must-for-cordial-ties-pm-writes-to-imran-101616525637261.html
24-03-2021||India||IMD launches new climate data portal||A steep rise in mean temperatures have been recorded across all seasons since 1996 onwards over India with the sharpest rising trend recorded in the pre-monsoon season, shows India Meteorological Department’s latest offering—Climate Data Service Portal.The data highlights the impact of climate change on India’s mean temperature trends.The portal launched on Tuesday on the occasion of World Meteorological Day has real time visualisation of meteorological data from across the country; climatological tables; visualisation of historical meteorological data including of monsoon rainfall pattern; mean temperature rise; frequency of cyclones etc.According to IMD, the CDSP will help researchers and the government in climate change studies; planning and mitigation strategies; early warning to people etc. Statistical analysis of meteorological data in the portal is still under development.CDSP also offers climatological data for each station. For example, for Safdarjung station, the mean maximum temperature from 1981 to 2010 has been 35.3 degree C and the highest temperature recorded in March at the station was 40.6 degree C on March 31, 1945. The mean wet bulb temperature recorded in June at 5.30 PM is 25.4 degree C; 27 degree C in July and 26.9 degree C in August—the three monsoon months.Wet bulb temperature is the lowest temperature to which air can be cooled by the evaporation of water into the air at a constant pressure. It is therefore measured by wrapping a wet wick around the bulb of a thermometer and the measured temperature corresponds to the wet bulb temperature according to a paper in Science Direct.A paper titled “The emergence of heat and humidity too severe for human tolerance” published in May 2020 said when it’s very hot and humidity is also extremely high, evaporation slows down and eventually stops. That point comes when the so-called the wet-bulb temperature reaches 35 degrees Celsius (95 degrees Fahrenheit).IMD’s theme for World Meteorological Day was “Oceans, Our Climate and Weather’ with scientists highlighting the Ocean’s impact on weather and climate especially during the El-Nino and La-Nina phases. The Ocean is also a major driver of the global economy, carrying more than 90% of world trade and sustaining the 40% of humanity that lives within 100 km of the coast.“Oceans absorb the greatest amount of solar radiation over 90%, the earth’s surface absorbs on 2.3% rest is absorbed by glaciers and other surfaces. So, you can imagine the impact of oceans on meteorology. ENSO episodes for example have a profound impact on weather conditions in US, India and many parts of the world,” said M Mohapatra, director general, IMD.El Niño and the Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is a periodic fluctuation in sea surface temperature and the air pressure of the overlying atmosphere across the equatorial Pacific Ocean according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).ENSO has a major influence on weather and climate patterns such as heavy rains, floods and drought. El Niño has a warming influence on global temperatures, whilst La Niña has the opposite effect. In India for example, El Nino is associated with drought or weak monsoon while La Nina is associated with strong monsoon and above average rains and colder winters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/imdlaunches-new-climate-data-portal-101616524956129.html
24-03-2021||India||In the BJP’s universe, the space of intellectuals and lateral entrants||On Saturday, senior journalist Swapan Dasgupta filed his nomination as a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) candidate in the West Bengal assembly polls, after stepping down as a nominated member of the Rajya Sabha.While Dasgupta has been a prominent supporter of the party for three decades, he isn’t the only career professional without direct roots in the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) to switch to the saffron outfit. In the central government, union ministers S Jaishankar, Hardeep Puri and RK Singh are among the former bureaucrats who have joined the party.The party has had a longer history of association with journalists who may or may not have joined it but are aligned with its world view and have assumed formal positions — Surya Prakash was appointed the chair of Prasar Bharti, Ashok Malik is now a policy advisor with the ministry of external affairs after having served a stint as press secretary to the President of India, and Chandan Mitra, before he switched to the Trinamool Congress, was a BJP leader and Rajya Sabha MP.These are just some representative names, but they point to a larger story — even as the BJP has drawn criticism from intellectuals of Left and liberal persuasions, the party has also, over the decades, engaged with intellectuals and professionals and sought to bring them within the party fold.The roots of the engagement Party veterans recall that this initiative was often led by LK Advani, who, with his articulate English-speaking skills and ability to communicate to elite audiences and engage with ideas, had opened doors for newer professionals; — indeed, Dasgupta was considered close to Advani in the 1990s. Atal Bihari Vajpayee too worked with talent from outside the party fold, with his prime minister’s office home to three former journalists — Sudheendra Kulkarni, Kanchan Guptà and Ashok Tandon. Both the towering leaders of the BJP enjoyed the company of those who were a part of the larger intellectual and media ecosystem of Delhi.Over the years, said a Rajya Sabha MP from the ruling party on the condition of anonymity, the BJP has steadfastly worked to expand its footprint in the intellectual circles with two objectives — to expand its legitimacy and to gain experience that helps in governance.Also Read | In TN manifesto, BJP vows laws on prohibition and forceful conversionA second BJP leader said that the party’s push to bring the intelligentsia gained momentum in the 1990s. “The party created cells back then, like the economic cell, the intellectual cell and the media cell,” the BJP leader said. “The aim was to bring the professionals sympathetic to the BJP closer to it.” This got momentum after the party formed the government in the wake of the 1998 polls. “After the BJP came to power, during the coalition era, a lot of talent joined the party. It comprised a number of professionals, including government officers,” he added.“This is a calculated approach that has been continued by the Prime Minister,” said the MP. “When the Congress took power in 1947 under the leadership of Jawahar Lal Nehru, the party had a whole crop of experienced professionals to choose from who became members of it. Indira Gandhi emulated the same model.” The MP added that while BJP has a mass base and cadre on the grassroots, the elites have traditionally been opposed to the BJP’s core ideology. “So, the idea is to make a dent in that segment. It also draws from a need for governance experience and add legitimacy to the party,” the MP said.The MP further added that the party is consistently trying to expand its base among the liberal elite, while keeping its Hindutva ideology intact. “People who are active, intelligent and futuristic, and most importantly aligned to the party’s core ideology, have been made ministers, others have been made MPs,” he said.The challenge for the new entrants While the BJP is home to leaders and activists who have not come from the RSS, there is often more than a direct connection between the rise in the party and the roots in the Sangh — from Vajpayee to Advani, Narendra Modi to Amit Shah, Nitin Gadkari to Manohar Lal Khattar, Devendra Fadnavis to Jairam Thakur, Murali Manohar Joshi to JP Nadda, top leaders proudly trace their roots to the Sangh or one of its affiliate organisations.In this backdrop, how do lateral entrants from professional backgrounds navigate the party?Also Read | Lok Sabha clears contentious bill on Delhi governance after heated debateBJP spokesperson Nalin Kohli said that the party was formed as an outfit that is not limited to the RSS. “The party has attracted a lot of talent. Many people, including some like me, who do not have a formal background with the Sangh, have been given responsibility in the party,” Kohli said.A senior government official working in a BJP-ruled state, who is closely affiliated with the Sangh, said that whoever joins the party from outside the RSS fold has to work extra hard rise in the party. “The party considers the individual very carefully,” the BJP member said. “Only after the loyalty to the party has been proven, does the individual rise in the organisation.” Giving the example of AK Sharma, a bureaucrat who worked closely with PM Modi and has now been inducted in the party fold as a member of the legislative council in Uttar Pradesh, the official said, “If people can reach the prime minister and the home minister, and have their confidence, it helps them rise even if they are from a non-RSS background.” the official added.The rise, and limits of the rise According to political analyst Suhas Palshikar, as the party grows, it requires intellectuals and experts to join it. “But these intellectuals and experts will have a limited brief,” he said. “They wouldn’t cross the line. Otherwise, they will not have the same leeway in the party.”He added that the leaders would have to uphold the cultural vision of the party. “Dasgupta has culturally upheld the vision in a different manner. There will hardly be anyone who directly contradicts the culture of the Sangh. Also, because it is not just the culture of the Sangh, it also the vision that the prime minister puts forth. Vajpayee did not necessarily do that.”Also Read | Row over Maharashtra minister rocks ParliamentThere have also been long standing differences between the RSS and the BJP on questions of organising the economy, he added. “To talk about the RSS as a single organisation would not be adequate. There is a larger network of organisations not directly controlled by the RSS. Post the 1970s, the RSS tasked several people with the intention of preparing for statecraft for when it came to power,” he said. “So, they have a primer on foreign policy, security and economy.”He added that now that the BJP is in power, the Sangh will want its share of the power. “Intellectuals are often enamored by power, so it is easy for organisations such as the Sangh and the BJP to attract persons with intellectual pretensions now that the BJP is in power. However, at this moment if you’re an intellectual without the backing of the RSS, it is highly likely that there will be a limit to which you will rise and you will either stagnate or be set aside,” Palshikar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-the-bjp-s-universe-the-space-of-intellectuals-and-lateral-entrants-101616480634180.html
24-03-2021||India||The story of IAF’s tryst with MiG-21 fighter planes||The March 17 crash of a MiG-21 Bison in Gwalior — the second this year — has turned the spotlight on India’s longest-serving fighter plane, its safety record and the Indian Air Force (IAF)’s plans to replace the ageing jets with newer ones in the coming years.The air force got its first single-engine MiG-21 in 1963, and it progressively inducted 874 variants of the Soviet-origin supersonic fighters to bolster its combat potential, said officials familiar with the MiG-21 fleet. But more than 400 MiG-21s have been involved in accidents that have claimed the lives of 200 pilots during the last six decades, earning the fighters ominous epithets such as “Flying Coffin” and “Widow Maker”.The two Bisons that crashed this year — the first accident took place near Suratgarh in Rajasthan on January 5 — are the most advanced variants of the MiG-21 fighter planes. The MiG-21 Bis (an upgraded variant of the plane flown for the first time in 1976) was further upgraded to MiG-21 Bison in India in 2000.IAF operates four squadrons of MiG-21 Bison aircraft — a squadron has 16 to 18 fighter jets. The last of these upgraded MiG-21s are set to be phased out in the next three to four years. Of the 874 variants inducted by the IAF, more than 60% were licence-produced in India.IAF’s overwhelming dependence Experts say that more MiG-21s have crashed than any other fighter because they formed the bulk of the fighter aircraft in the IAF’s inventory for a long time. IAF had to keep its MiG-21 fleet flying longer than it would have liked because of delay in the induction of new fighters.“Was there a choice? You have to have a certain number of fighter planes to guard your skies. The induction of multi-role fighters was delayed, only 36 Rafales came instead of the projected requirement of 126 jets, the light combat aircraft (LCA) programme is behind schedule and fighters such as Sukhoi-30 have had serviceability issues. IAF had to make do with its MiG-21 fleet,” said Air Vice Marshal Sunil Nanodkar (retired), a former assistant chief of air staff.Also Read | A woman pilot to join MiG-29 squadron after Bison, Sukhoi, RafaleDelay in the induction of advanced jet trainers led to supersonic MiG-21 fighters being used for training pilots in the 1980s, 1990s and early 2000s. This period witnessed an increase in the accident rate of these fighters, said one of the officials cited above. The accident rate of the MiG-21s in the 1990s was 2.89 per 10,000 flying hours, which came down to 0.27 per 10,000 hours after the induction of Hawk-132 advanced jet trainers in late 2000s, official data accessed by Hindustan Times shows.Before the induction of the British-origin Hawks, MiG-21s accounted for half of the total flying hours of the IAF. The Hawks were inducted in 2008 to meet a long-standing need of the IAF. The planes are crucial for the training of combat pilots as they serve as a bridge between subsonic trainers and supersonic fighters.IAF trained its pilots on the MiG-21s for a long time before the Hawks were inducted, Nanodkar said.“That added to the MiG-21 losses. Pilots went straight from subsonic Kiran trainers to supersonic MiG-21s. The requirement for servicing and spares also went up as the MiG-21s were flying a lot in the training role. Maintenance became a nightmare after the end of the Soviet Union in 1991,” said Nanodkar.The leap from Kiran trainers to MiG-21 was daunting as the pilots faced a huge variation in aircraft speed, performance and technology. The MiG-21 has a takeoff and landing speed of more than 330 kmph compared to 200 kmph for the Kiran tainers.An operational assetThe Bison is not the same aircraft as the one inducted in the 1960s and has been modernised to meet the IAF’s requirements, said a senior official.The Bison was involved in IAF operations after the unprecedented, peacetime, cross-border strike against terror targets in Pakistan’s Balakot two years ago.Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman scripted military aviation history by downing a Pakistan Air Force (PAF) F-16, seconds before his own MiG-21 Bison was hit by a missile forcing him to eject on February 27, 2019. He was later awarded the Vir Chakra, India’s third-highest wartime gallantry award. The citation, published in the Gazette of India in December 2019, said his aggressive manoeuvres forced enemy fighters into tactical chaos and he courageously engaged the hostile aircraft package despite its numerical and technological superiority.The aerial combat with PAF took place a day after IAF’s Mirage-2000s struck targets in Balakot in response to the Pakistan-backed Pulwama suicide attack in Kashmir in which 40 Central Reserve Police Force men were killed on February 14.Also Read | IAF group captain killed in MiG-21 Bison crash in GwaliorExperts said the Bison was an extremely capable platform that the IAF will stretch to the end of its service life — 2024.“The (Bison) upgrade was significant and essentially on avionics, radar, electronic warfare suite and weapons. The aircraft is very safe to fly, has had a good safety record and will see IAF through till 2023-24,” said Air Marshal Anil Chopra (retd), who was the team leader of the MiG-21 upgrade programme, on March 17.The modernisation plansIAF will induct different variants of Tejas LCA in the coming years to replace the ageing aircraft. The defence ministry last month awarded a ₹48,000-crore contract to Hindustan Aeronautics Limited for 83 LCA Mk-1A jets for IAF. The first Mk-1A aircraft will be delivered to the air force in three years, with the rest being supplied by 2030. The deal involves the supply of 73 Mk-1A fighter jets and 10 LCA Mk-1 trainer aircraft.The deal for the 83 Mk-1A jets took the total number of Tejas variants ordered to 123. The 40 LCAs already ordered by IAF are in the initial operational clearance (IOC) and the more advanced final operational clearance (FOC) configurations. The LCA Mk-1A will come with additional improvements over the FOC aircraft, making it the most advanced Tejas variant so far.IAF is also looking at building 114 fighter jets in the country in partnership with a foreign manufacturer under the government’s Make in India plan. IAF is among the last air forces to be flying the MiG-21 variants and even Jaguars, said Chopra.Also Read | Second Rafale squadron to be raised in Bengal’s Hasimara in April“Even smaller air forces retired MiG-21s long ago. Every crash of an old aircraft is a reminder for IAF to replace older fleets. Modernisation of IAF is behind schedule. Two things are needed immediately. Accelerate the development of LCA variants, increase their rates of production and speed up the advanced medium combat aircraft (AMCA) project. Secondly, send out the request for proposal for 114 new fighters,” Chopra said.The government is likely to approve India’s homegrown fifth-generation fighter programme - the AMCA - by mid-year, with design, development and first prototypes set to cost around ₹15,000 crore. The IAF’s modernisation map envisages the deployment of around 120 AMCA (six squadrons) 2032 onwards, with the stealth planes forming an important element of future air combat.Quality and quantity should top the IAF’s modernisation priorities, Nanodkar said.The count of IAF’s fighter squadrons has shrunk to 31 compared to an optimum strength of 42-plus. Five years ago, IAF’s then vice chief BS Dhanoa (who went on to become the IAF chief) admitted that the air force did not have sufficient number of warplanes to fight a two-front war with China and Pakistan.“Our numbers are not adequate to fully execute an air campaign in a two-front scenario,” Dhanoa said in March 2016, drawing attention to the sharp drawdown of India’s fighter fleet. IAF then had 33 fighter squadrons.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/the-story-of-iaf-s-tryst-with-mig-21-fighter-planes-101616475053938.html
