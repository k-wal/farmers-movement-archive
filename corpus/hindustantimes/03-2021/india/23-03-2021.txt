The single-judge bench of Justice V Bharathidasan granted bail to Karnan arrested in December 2020 on the condition that a personal bond of ₹50,000 along with two sureties would be furnished.Other conditions include refraining from ‘committing similar offences’ of releasing defamatory videos, making abusive statements and he will have to remain in Chennai. Karnan has had to give an undertaking that he will not abscond during investigations and will not tamper with evidence. His bail would be cancelled if he doesn’t follow the conditions laid down by the court. Karnan’s bail petitions were rejected earlier and he was granted conditional bail this time as he needs treatment for post-Covid-19 complications.Ten FIRs have been registered against Karnan under various sections of the Indian Penal Code and Information Technology Act on complaints from the Bar Associations of Tamil Nadu and Puducherry on charges that he had uploaded as many as 33 abusive videos on social media such as YouTube and Facebook. He also faces a complaint of trespassing into the residence of a woman Supreme Court judge. During the course of the case, Karnan had admitted to uploading videos as he was suffering from mental depression, the court said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/madras-hc-grants-conditional-bail-to-former-judge-cs-karnan-101616523846199.html
23-03-2021||India||Supreme Court stays OTT regulation proceedings in various High Courts||The Supreme Court on Tuesday restrained High Courts from hearing petitions to regulate content of releases on over-the-top platforms such as Amazon Prime, Netflix, Hotstar and Zee5.On Tuesday, a three-judge bench headed by Justice DY Chandrachud stayed proceedings in separate petitions pending in this regard before the Punjab & Haryana High Court, Madhya Pradesh High Court and Allahabad High Court. The bench, also comprising Justices MR Shah and Sanjiv Khanna pointed out that about 20 petitions are pending in other High Courts as well following which the top court applied the stay order to such other High Courts where a similar issue is pending.The order was passed on a petition moved by the Centre seeking transfer of all petitions to regulate OTTs from various High Courts to Supreme Court. Last month, the top court had issued notice on this petition moved jointly by the Ministry of Information & Broadcasting, Electronics and Information Technology and the Ministry of Law and Justice.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta appearing for the Centre pointed out that despite notice on the transfer petition, the Punjab and Haryana High Court was continuing to hear the petition. He requested the Court to stay the proceedings before the respective High Courts.Along with Centre’s plea, the bench took up two PILs filed separately by NGO Justice for Rights Foundation and advocate Shashank Shekhar Jha. The petitions had demanded an autonomous body much on the lines of Censor Board to screen, filter and regulate content shown on OTT platforms.In response to one of these petitions, the Centre submitted an affidavit indicating the legal position governing OTT platforms. “There is a mechanism for regulation of the OTT Platforms under the provisions of the Information Technology Act, 2000 and the newly framed Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules 2021 notified on February 25, 2021.”The Centre informed the Court that it received complaints of members of civil society, Parliamentarians and Chief Ministers on the content streamed by OTT platforms and the need to regulate the same. The IT Rules 2021 now provide for an oversight mechanism and a self-regulatory body, the affidavit filed by Information Technology Ministry stated. With the mechanism already been put in place, the Centre demanded dismissal of the petitions which were filed prior in time to the 2021 Rules.Even the 2021 Rules are under scrutiny in a separate proceeding before the Supreme Court. Early this month, the Supreme Court had termed the 2021 IT Rules on OTT Platforms to “lack teeth” as it contained no penal provision for enforcing its implementation. The matter is pending consideration as the Centre expressed its willingness to revise the Rules.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-stays-ott-regulation-proceedings-in-various-high-courts-101616523074280.html
23-03-2021||India||Atmosphere of trust, without terror imperative: PM Modi’s message to Imran Khan||An atmosphere of trust, devoid of terror and hostility, is “imperative” for better relations between India and Pakistan, Prime Minister Narendra Modi told his Pakistani counterpart Imran Khan on Tuesday.The message was part of a letter of greetings sent by Modi to Khan on the occasion of Pakistan Day. People familiar with developments, speaking on condition of anonymity, described the letter as a routine message sent to heads of government or state on national days.“As a neighbouring country, India desires cordial relations with the people of Pakistan. For this, an atmosphere of trust, devoid of terror and hostility, is imperative,” said the letter.The letter also referred to the impact of Covid-19 as a “difficult time for humanity”, and conveyed Modi’s best wishes to Khan and the people of Pakistan “for dealing with the challenges” of the pandemic.A separate message was sent by President Ram Nath Kovind to his Pakistani counterpart Arif Alvi, the people cited above said.After it emerged on Saturday that Khan had tested positive for Covid-19 and was self-isolating at home, Modi had tweeted: “Best wishes to Prime Minister @ImranKhanPTI for a speedy recovery from Covid-19.”Earlier on Tuesday, Pakistan’s chargé d'affaires Aftab Hasan Khan said his country desires friendly relations with all nations, including India, and the two sides should resolve all outstanding issues through dialogue.The diplomat made the remarks while addressing an event organised at the Pakistan high commission to mark Pakistan Day. The comments came against the backdrop of a thaw in bilateral relations after the armies of the two countries recommitted themselves to the 2003 ceasefire along the Line of Control (LoC) last month.“Pakistan wants to have friendly relations with all countries including India,” Aftab Hasan Khan said, according to a statement issued by the Pakistani mission.“To achieve peace between Pakistan and India, both countries shall resolve all outstanding issues including [Jammu and Kashmir] through dialogue,” he said. Peace within South Asia is “inevitable” for the larger interest of the region, he added.The chargé d'affaires spoke after raising the Pakistani flag at the brief ceremony with limited participation in view of the pandemic. Messages from the president and prime minister of Pakistan were also read out at the ceremony.Noting that Muslims under the leadership of Muhammad Ali Jinnah had made a resolve to create a separate homeland on March 23, 1940, the chargé d'affaires said the day is observed as Pakistan Day every year.The Indian and Pakistani high commissions in Islamabad and New Delhi are currently headed by the deputy chiefs of mission as Pakistan decided not to post an envoy in the Indian capital after Jammu and Kashmir's special status was scrapped in August 2019. Pakistan also expelled the Indian envoy and downgraded diplomatic ties.The Indian and Pakistani armies began strictly adhering to the 2003 ceasefire on the LoC in Jammu and Kashmir from the midnight of February 24 – the apparent outcome of behind-the-scenes contacts between senior security officials of the two countries.Last week, Pakistan Army chief Gen Qamar Bajwa said the time has come for India and Pakistan to “bury the past and move forward”, though he cautioned that any peace process would be susceptible to disruption without the resolution of the Kashmir issue.Bajwa’s conciliatory remarks came a day after Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan said India will have to take the first step for improving bilateral ties by addressing Kashmir, the only issue standing in the way of better relations.The foreign ministers of India and Pakistan are set to participate in the ministerial meeting of the Heart of Asia-Istanbul Process in the Tajikistan capital of Dushanbe on March 30. However, it is still not clear whether they will hold a bilateral meeting in Dushanbe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/atmosphere-of-trust-without-terror-imperative-pm-modi-s-message-to-imran-khan-101616518073600.html

It was further agreed that, in return for getting access to the AZ technology AZD1222, Serum Institute Of India Pvt. Ltd will treat AstraZeneca as a priority customer, whether it is for drug substance or finished product," Singh stated.According to the agreement, Serum Institute has to supply millions of doses of Covishield to AstraZeneca according to their requirement. "We have to supply at least 50 lakh doses to AstraZeneca immediately for use in the UK.""This is of utmost priority as AstraZeneca has conveyed and is also reminding us of our obligation to supply Covishield to them according to the agreement. AstraZeneca and representative of the UK Government have also conveyed to us today morning that if these minimum 50 lakh doses are not supplied to the UK immediately this week then the UK government might have to halt the vaccination programme," Singh said.The letter also reminded the government that the Serum Institute has received the technology to manufacture Covishield from AstraZeneca-Oxford and need to honour the commitment to supply at least 50 lakh doses of the vaccine."We are sure, considering the gravity of the situation and prestige of our company as well as our country is at stake, you will definitely intervene and give permission to us to supply at least 50 lakh doses of Covishield to the UK this week. We will be highly obliged for the same. We assure you that the Government of India's vaccination programme will not be disturbed because of this supply," Singh stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sii-seeks-govt-s-nod-to-supplu-50-lakh-covishield-covid-19-vaccine-doses-to-uk-101616519343038.html

23-03-2021||India||'Considerable threat': Delhi bans public fests of Holi amid daily Covid surge||The Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) on Tuesday ruled that there will be no public celebrations for Holi, Navratri in general, as the Capital is witnessing a steady surge in the number of Covid-19 cases. Unlike Maharashtra, Punjab, the Capital is not among the states that are reporting the highest number of daily Covid-19 cases. However, on Tuesday, Delhi reported 1,101 fresh Covid-19 cases, the highest in this year.Noting that there has been a "persistent rise" in Covid-19 cases in the NCT of Delhi during the last fortnight, the DDMA, in its order, said, "It is anticipated that gathering, congregations and public celebrations during upcoming festivals like Holi, Shab-e-Barat, Navratri etc., may pose a considerable threat of the spread of virus and may cause a setback to the appreciable gains made in the suppression of chain of transmission of Covid-19 cases in Delhi. Considering this, it has been decided that public celebrations and all gatherings/congregations during upcoming festivities should not be allowed in public places."Public places include parks, grounds, markets, religious places etc., the authorities noted."In case any person is found violating the aforesaid instructions, the defaulting person(s) shall be proceeded against as per the provisions of Section 51 to 60 of Disaster Management Act, 2005, Section 188 of IPC and other applicable laws," the DDMA said.The authorities have also notified that at all airports, railway stations and inter-state bus terminals, there will be random testing of passengers coming from other states.For the past one week, the Capital has been witnessing a steady surge in the number of daily cases.

On Thursday, there were 607 cases, on Friday 716, on saturday 813, on Sunday 823, on Monday 888 to reach to the three-month high on 1,101 on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-celebration-for-holi-navratri-in-delhi-orders-delhi-govt-as-cases-reach-1k-101616514451498.html
23-03-2021||India||Delhi court upholds 2-year jail term to Somnath Bharti for attack on AIIMS staff||A Delhi court Tuesday upheld an order sentencing AAP MLA Somnath Bharti to two years in jail for assaulting the AIIMS security staff after which he was taken into custody and sent to prison, his lawyer said.A magistrate court had in January sentenced him to two years in prison.Special Judge Vikas Dhull partly dismissed Bharti's appeal and convicted him for the offences under sections 147 (rioting) read with 149 (unlawful assembly) of IPC and under section 3 (mischief causing damage to public property) of the Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act.The court, however, set aside his conviction under sections 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 353 (assault or use of criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty) read with section 149 of IPC.According to the prosecution, on September 9, 2016, Bharti, along with nearly 300 others, brought down the fence of a boundary wall at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) here with a JCB operator.According to Bharti, AIIMS had no authorisation to cover the 'nallah' (drain) between Gautam Nagar and Ring Road as it was public property and had to be opened for general use. During the course of the investigation, it came on record that the drain was given on lease to the AIIMS for covering and maintenance.The sessions court said in its order that the evidence of eyewitnesses to the incident was consistent to the effect that a gathering of around 200-300 people along with Bharti was present near the boundary wall of AIIMS and they were trying to break the wall and the fence by the use of JCB machine.It added that when some of the eyewitnesses resisted the bringing down of the fence, they were abused and injured due to stone-pelting by the mob."The evidence which has come on record of the eyewitnesses shows that unlawful assembly was comprised of 200-300 persons of which appellant (Bharti) was the member."It is true that only five accused persons were charged for the offence under Section 147 IPC read with Section 149 IPC and out of which four accused persons have been acquitted but still I do not find any illegality in the conviction of the appellant for the offence under section 147 IPC read with Section 149 IPC as the evidence which has come on record shows that unlawful assembly was comprising of 200-300 persons and the remaining persons could not be identified or apprehended," the judge said in his order.The judge said however that the magistrate court had committed "grave illegality" in convicting the AAP leader for the offence of voluntarily causing hurt as the evidence of the injured persons were not reliable and trustworthy.It said no explanation has been given by the prosecution as to why the injured persons were not medically examined on the date of the offence and on what basis, opinion was sought when no injuries were observed by the doctor or reported by the injured."The opinion regarding injuries has been taken by the IO (investigating officer) on May 5, 2018, i.e. almost after two years of the incident," it said.It further said the manner in which the persons had suffered injuries was not corroborative and was contradictory to each other which made their testimony doubtful and unreliable.The court said the prosecution has not brought any such medical record which made this court raise an adverse inference against prosecution that no such injuries were suffered by the injured."In the light of the evidence which has come on record, the evidence of injured persons namely...was not at all reliable and trustworthy and the MLCs could not have been relied upon."Therefore, the trial court had committed grave illegality in convicting the appellant for the offence under section 323 IPC read with Section 149 IPC when the evidence which has come on record, was not reliable and trustworthy. Accordingly, the appellant is acquitted for the offence under Section323 IPC read with Section 149 IPC," it said.In his appeal filed through advocate Mohd Irshad, Bharti had claimed the magistrate court's order was based upon a totally false and fabricated story of the prosecution which failed miserably to provide even an iota of evidence to prove his guilt.The public prosecutor, appearing for the police, said there was no illegality or infirmity in the judgment for conviction and sentencing order of the magistrate court and the judgment has been delivered based upon the reliable evidence which has come on record.In January, Bharti was granted bail to enable him to file an appeal before the high court against his conviction in the case and jail term.The magistrate court had acquitted Bharti's associates and co-accused -- Jagat Saini, Dileep Jha, Sandeep Sonu and Rakesh Pandey -- citing a lack of evidence against them.The case was lodged on the basis of a complaint from R S Rawat, Chief Security Officer, AIIMS.Bharti had told the court that police officials and other witnesses had deposed against him in order to falsely implicate him in the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-court-upholds-2-year-jail-term-to-somnath-bharti-for-attack-on-aiims-staff-101616512680890.html

23-03-2021||India||Maha Covid-19 spike: 132 deaths in last 24 hours, single-day surge of over 28k||Maharashtra on Tuesday recorded 28,699 fresh infections, taking the total tally to 25,33,026. The 24-hour death toll in the state projected a sharp jump from Monday's toll as from 58 deaths of Monday, the single-day toll jumped straight to 132. The spike comes on a day the Centre alerted all states and Union territories to be on guard in view of the upcoming festivities of Holi.With Tuesday's spike, active cases in Maharashtra jumped to 2,30,641 — the highest in the country. The state's 24-hour recovery tally on Tuesday was 3,165, which is a considerable increase from Monday's recovery figure of 11,314. But the gap between daily recoveries and daily infections is not narrowing as the rate of increase in infections is more than that of the recoveries.Among the districts contributing the highest to Maharashtra's single-day surge is Nagpur which recorded 3,095 fresh cases and 33 deaths on Tuesday. Pune district, which has the highest number of active Covid-19 cases in the country, reported 5,722 fresh infections. Mumbai city on Tuesday reported 3,512 fresh infections, continuing its trend of the daily surge.Joining the list of districts that are observing partial lockdown and night curfews to bring the spread of the infection under check, Parbhani district in Maharashtra's Marathwada region announced on Tuesday that the entire district will remain under a lockdown from March 24 to March 31, as all previous measures to stop people from crowing have failed.District collector Deepak Mugalikar said the earlier measures like preventing people from stepping out of their houses at night didn't prove to be effective as the graph of new cases went up, PTI reported."The lockdown will come into force at 7 PM on Wednesday. It will be strictly implemented till March 31 with an objective to curb the rising number of Covid-19 cases in the district," he said.As from April 1, vaccination will be open to everyone above the age of 45, the Centre has asked all states to bolster their testing, tracking and treating mechanism. Lockdowns can be imposed at district or city level, but there should be no restriction on interstate and intrastate travel, the ministry of home affairs said on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maha-covid-19-spike-28-699-cases-today-lockdown-in-parbhani-from-tomorrow-101616511048785.html
23-03-2021||India||4.85 crore people administered Covid-19 vaccines so far: Govt||As many as 4.85 crore people have received anti-Covid-19 vaccine till now, with over 32.5 lakh taking it in the last 24 hours, the government told Rajya Sabha on Tuesday.Replying to supplementaries during the Question Hour, Health Minister Harsh Vardhan said the pace of inoculation in the country is not slow and 40 per cent of the total vaccines administered across the world in a single day are in India."I have to say that it is not correct that the speed of vaccination is slow. Till today morning, 4.85 crore people have taken vaccines in the country, and in the last 24 hours, as many as 32,53,095 people have taken vaccines," he said when asked about the vaccination drive being slow."Of the total vaccines administered in a single day, 40 per cent of it is administered in India," Vardhan told the House.The minister in a written reply said that the government of India is coordinating with state governments at all levels and the highest example is the prime minister's continuous dialogue with chief ministers on Covid-19 and how the vaccination drive can be sped up.The Centre is providing vaccines to all states, he said."The government of India is in touch with state governments. We have a national expert group on vaccine administration which guides us on vaccination," Vardhan said.On a question about private hospitals allegedly overcharging and not providing free services to the poor despite being given free or subsidised land, he said health is a state subject and state governments make agreements when such land is given, and they monitor the process."When required, the government of India holds meetings with different hospitals on capping hospital charges," he said, citing the example of capping the price of Covid-19 vaccines.Vaccines are being provided to all states, including Maharashtra, on the basis of a ratio of vaccines provided and used by states, the minister informed when a member asked for more vaccines for the state which has the highest number of coronavirus cases in the country."Adequate vaccines are available to all states and there is no shortage.

23-03-2021||India||Rajya Sabha adjourned after protests over NCT Bill||Rajya Sabha on Tuesday witnessed a series of adjournments amid protests by the Opposition over the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi (Amendment) Bill, 2021 that seeks to give overarching powers over Delhi’s daily functioning to the Centre-appointed Lieutenant Governor. Lok Sabha passed the bill on Monday. No sooner had minister of state for home G Kishan Reddy moved the bill for consideration in the Upper House than the Opposition members began their protests, with some MPs walking down to the Well of the house. Amid protests by angry members, the house witnessed four adjournments before it was finally adjourned for the day. Soon after Reddy moved the bill, leader of Opposition Mallikarjun Kharge said it was a “dangerous bill” that sought to take away the rights of elected representatives. The bill says the “government” in Delhi will mean the L-G in the context of all legislation passed by the city-state’s assembly. Also, it makes it mandatory for the city government to seek the L-G’s opinion before any executive action. Before the house was finally adjourned for the day, Parliamentary affairs minister Prahlad Joshi said the government and the Opposition had reached the consensus that the house will meet at 10 am on Wednesday. He said the NCT bill would be taken up after a discussion on the Finance Bill on March 24, and there would be no Zero Hour, Question Hour or lunch break.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajya-sabha-adjourned-after-protests-over-nct-bill-101616510816231.html

The state has been witnessing a steady increase in the number of Covid-19 cases for the past several days with a large number of infections being reported from a few schools in the state. The education minister said the decision to close down all educational institutions and student hostels was taken in view of the outbreak of the second wave of infections across the country. “Except medical colleges, all government and private schools, colleges and universities will remain closed from Wednesday till further orders,” Sabita said, adding that online classes, however, would continue. She said there had been reports of a large number of Covid-19 cases from various educational institutions across the state.

All movements, including that of trains, flights, buses, were prohibited. Only essential services were allowed. As one year of the imposition of the lockdown approaches, several states are imposing local lockdowns and border restrictions to make sure cases are not imported from areas that are particularly reporting a massive outbreak.However, there is not likely to be another national-level lockdown, the Centre has made it clear as the focus is on tracking new infections, not shutting down establishments. In its latest guideline for the month of April, the ministry of home affairs said all activities have been permitted outside containment zones. These activities include movement by passenger trains; air travel; metro trains; schools; higher educational institutions; hotels and restaurants; shopping malls, multiplexes and entertainment parks; yoga centres and gymnasiums; exhibitions, assemblies and congregations, etc.Focus on Covid-19 test-track-treat, may impose district-level lockdown: CentreWhile the SOPs (Standard operating procedure) for each of these activities will have to be followed, there will be no restrictions on the interstate and intrastate movement of persons and goods, the Centre said. By restrictions, it meant separate permission, approval, e-permit, while most states are making Covid-19 tests mandatory for people coming from other states.Lockdown ensures containment of the infection for just a specific period of time, but tracking, testing should be the focus at this moment, the Centre has been emphasising, after the process of unlocking began in 2020.However, lockdown can be an option at district/sub-district and city/ward level, with a view to containing the spread of the infection, based on the assessment of the situation, the Centre said.On being asked about what the Centre is thinking on lockdown given the sudden spurt in infections, Union minister Prakash Javadekar on Tuesday said, "Centre is in constant touch with the states which are reporting a surge in Covid-19 infections. We are hopeful that the situation will improve in the coming days."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-2nd-peak-as-daily-cases-rise-what-centre-says-on-lockdown-101616503241947.html

23-03-2021||India||Gold smuggling case: ED moves Kerala HC, seeks quashing of FIR against officials||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Tuesday moved the Kerala High Court seeking to quash the FIR registered against its officials by Kerala police for allegedly forcing Swapna Suresh, key accused in the gold smuggling case, to give statements against chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan.In its plea, the ED alleged the FIR was registered against its unnamed officials with "ulterior motive of derailing the statutory investigation" under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) into a large economic offence of smuggling of huge quantities of gold.In its prayer, the ED submitted that the FIR filed be quashed or the investigation be transferred from the state police to the CBI to ensure an impartial investigation.The central agency also wanted the court to stay all further proceedings pursuant to the FIR against ED officials and direct no coercive action against the officers of the Enforcement Directorate "who are performing their official duties" under the PMLA 2002 pending disposal of the petition.The impugned FIR has been registered with an oblique motive to put pressure on the Investigating Officers,besides also "ensure that trial is not conducted in a fair and impartial manner because certain highly placed persons are involved in this case," the ED submitted. It also submitted that the preliminary inquiry allegedly conducted by the state police was clearly a farce.The Crime Branch registered the case on March17 on the basis of a report filed by the Crime Branch team which was probing the leak of a voice clip, purportedly belonging to Suresh.According to the FIR, the ED officials, probing the gold smuggling case while questioning an accused named Swapna Prabha Suresh on August 12 and 13, 2020, have forced her to give false statements against the state chief minister in order to make fake evidence.The Crime Branch case has been registered under section 120-B (criminal conspiracy), 167 (public servant framing an incorrect document with intent to cause injury), 192 (fabricating false evidence), 195-A (threatening any person to give false evidence), among others, of the Indian Penal Code.Suresh, a former employee of the UAE consulate here, is the prime accused in the case relating to the smuggling of 30 kg of gold worth ₹14.82 crore in a diplomatic baggage and now under judicial custody since her arrest.In a voice clip purported to be that of Suresh circulated a few months ago, it was alleged that some ED officials had threatened her while she was being interrogated at the agency office in Kochi in August last year to give statements against Vijayan and some ministers.Later, two women civil police officers, who had been with Suresh when she was interrogated by the ED, had also reportedly claimed they had heard the ED officials forcing her to name Vijayan.Besides the ED, the Customs and the National Investigation Agency are also probing the smuggling of gold through the diplomatic channel.Vijayan has been accusing the Central agencies of targeting his government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gold-smuggling-case-ed-moves-kerala-hc-seeks-quashing-of-fir-against-officials-101616501326869.html

What's happening in the state is not 'vikas' (development), it is 'vasuli' (extortion)."Dubbing the Maharashtra dispensation as "the most confused government", Prasad said the ruling coalition partners themselves don't know what is happening in the state and who is running the show.Prasad said the Maharashtra government led by Shiv Sena leader Uddhav Thackeray has lost the right to govern the state as "it is a government of vasuli (extortion), by vasuli and for vasuli."Taking on NCP supremo Sharad Pawar, Prasad said the political credibility of the senior leader has taken a hit and that he was forced to speak a patent falsehood for defending his party colleague and state home minister Deshmukh.Prasad further said Pawar's credibility can be restored only if he ensures resignation of Deshmukh.Days after he was shunted out, former Mumbai Police commissioner Singh wrote a letter to Thackeray alleging that the state home minister had asked Sachin Waze, currently in custody of the National Investigation Agency (NIA), and other police officers to collect ₹100 crore monthly, including ₹50 crore to ₹60 crore from bars and restaurants in Mumbai.Deshmukh had denied these allegations.The NIA is probing Waze's alleged role in placing an explosives-laden SUV outside industrialist Mukesh Ambani's residence on February 25.The SUV was in possession of Thane-based businessman Mansukh Hiran, who was found dead at a creek near Mumbai. The case related to the death of Hiran was also handed over to the NIA.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-govt-is-of-extortion-by-extortion-and-for-extortion-rs-prasad-101616501433460.html

As the number of fresh infections in the country is skyrocketing and local restrictions are coming back, the Centre in its new directive made it clear that such restrictions are okay to be imposed at district/ sub-district and city/ ward level, ruling out statewide lockdown at this situation. It also said there will be no bar on the inter-state and intra-state movement of persons and goods. The guideline will remain effective till April 30, it said."There shall be no restriction on inter-State and intra-State movement of persons and goods including those for cross land-border trade under Treaties with neighbouring countries. No separate permission/ approval/ e-permit will be required for such movements," it said.The new rules are to address the sudden rise in the number of Covid-19 cases in the country, the order said.All those above 45 years will be eligible for Covid-19 vaccine from April 1Most of the new orders have been derived from the recent discussion held between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the heads of the states and the Union territories. Apart from increasing the proportion of RT-PCR tests to the prescribed 70 per cent, states will have to bring back their focus on tracking cases, isolating and treating them while demarcating containment zones like they did last year, it said. "Local district, police and municipal authorities shall be responsible to ensure that the prescribed Containment measures are strictly followed and State/ UT Governments shall ensure the accountability of the officers concerned in this regard," the new order said.With several districts, cities going under fresh lockdown in the wake of what is being considered as the second wave of Covid-19, the Centre said states and UTs, based on their assessment of the situation, may impose local restrictions, at district/ sub-district and city/ ward level, with a view to containing the spread of Covid-19.On vaccination, the Centre said that the pace is uneven across different states and UTs and the slow pace in some states is a matter of concern.

Soldiers are awarded medals for gallantry, distinguished service and several key landmarks in their military careers. The army has signed a contract for 17 different types of medals. “Integrated Headquarters of Ministry of Defence (Army) has concluded a contract for procurement of a total of 17.27 lakh Service Medals of 17 different types,” the army wrote on Twitter. The move has resolved a decade-old problem. The procurement has enabled the army to meet all outstanding demands of service medals of soldiers who have served and are serving the force, the army said. Also Read | Myanmar: Army uproots ethnic villagers amid anti-coup protestsFor almost 10 years, soldiers were buying medals from the market as the army was grappling with a short supply. While there was no shortage of medals awarded to soldiers for gallantry, the defence ministry’s department of medals failed to issue the other variety of medals for almost a decade, officials familiar with the development said. The difference between original and duplicate medals is that the latter don’t have the names of soldiers and their service number engraved on them.

23-03-2021||India||Covid vaccine above 45: Which vaccine should you take? What should be the gap between doses?||As the vaccination drive will be open for all above the age of 45 years from April 1, India is set to cross a major milestone in its fight against Covid-19, which is completing a year in March, 2021.Here is all you need to know about vaccination above 45.Who are eligible?Everyone above the age of 45 years is now eligible for vaccination. This includes those with co-morbidities and those who do not have any health issues.Is there no need for a medical certificate regarding co-morbidities?As vaccination is open for all above 45 years, there is no need for medical certificates from April 1. The government earlier published a list of comorbidities which included heart issues, hypertension, diabetes, kidney, liver issues, leukaemia among many other conditions.Why did the government specify health conditions in the second phase only to do away with it now?The second phase of vaccination commenced on March 1. Senior citizens and people with comorbidities between the age of 45 and 59 were considered priority groups in this phase. Now as the vaccination has gained pace, based on scientific advice, the government is opening the drive a little more to accommodate more beneficiaries. The government started the vaccination drive with the most vulnerable groups, healthcare workers and frontline workers. Then it moved to senior citizens and people with co-morbidities, as they are at a greater risk of contracting the infection than young people, because of their age and health conditions, respectively.Covaxin or Covishield: Which vaccine to takeThe Centre has emphasised that both the vaccines have proved to be successful and has advised to go for any vaccine.Four weeks or eight weeks: What should be the gap between the doses?The two doses of a vaccine were being administered 28 days apart so far. But now the expert group has reviewed recent scientific evidence and has advised widening the gap to six to eight weeks for Covishield, the vaccine developed by Oxford University and pharma company AstraZeneca and manufactured in India by Pune's Serum Institute of India.There has been no new instruction for Bharat Biotech's Covaxin.Doctors in the health centre, hospitals where you will get your first dose will advise you regarding the timing of the second dose.How much will the vaccine cost?At government facilities, the vaccination will be free while private facilities can charge a maximum of ₹250 for a dose.Will you still have to register on Co-Win now that the vaccination is being made open?Yes. Without registration on Co-Win, there will be no vaccination as the government is maintaining every vaccination data through this interface.Will this move help address vaccine wastage? How?At present, vaccine wastage is a concern for India, as many states are reporting over 10 per cent vaccine wastage. The issue was raised in Prime Minister Narendra Modi's recent meeting with the heads of the states and Union territories. Vaccines get wasted when the vial is opened but the beneficiary does not turn up. If there are enough beneficiaries, then this problem might be mitigated. Allowing more people for vaccination is one step to ensure that there are more beneficiaries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-vaccine-above-45-which-vaccine-should-you-take-what-should-be-the-gap-101616497689150.html

Addressing the Lok Sabha, Vardhan said, “Vaccine doses administered in India in a single day amount to 30-40% of the doses given across the world during the same time period.”Citing Monday’s vaccination data, Vardhan said that 32,53,095 beneficiaries were vaccinated in the last 24 hours. The health minister also informed the lower house of Parliament that more than 2.2 crore beneficiaries above the age of 60 were inoculated in a short period of time since the start of the second phase in March.#LargestVaccineDrive #Unite2FightCoronaभारत में सबसे तेज़ गति से कोरोना के खिलाफ टीकाकरण किया जा रहा है। बाकी देशों में जितनी वैक्सीन रोज़ाना मिलकर लगाई जा रही है, उसकी 30% से 40% वैक्सीन रोज़ाना सिर्फ भारत में लगाई जा रही है।- @drharshvardhan @PMOIndia @AshwiniKChoubey pic.twitter.com/CuEQCIDrYGThe Centre launched the first phase of the nationwide vaccination drive from January 16, where all healthcare and frontline workers were inoculated against the disease. Under the second phase, which started from March 1, doses are being administered to people above the age of 60 and those between 45-59 with specific co-morbidities. According to the health ministry’s data at 7am, around 4,06,31,153 beneficiaries have been administered the first dose while 78,63,441 have received both doses. Five states - Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Gujarat, West Bengal - have vaccinated the highest number of beneficiaries in the country, the data showed.Also Read| All those above 45 years will be eligible for Covid-19 vaccine from April 1India on Tuesday recorded 40,715 new Covid-19 disease cases and 199 related fatalities in the last 24 hours, taking the caseload and death toll to over 1.168 crores and 160,166 respectively. The active cases have climbed to 345,377 while 1,11,81,253 people have recovered till now.With the daily cases in the country spiking since February, several states requested the Centre to remove or reduce the age limit for getting vaccine doses so that more citizens can be inoculated as quickly as possible. Keeping this in mind, Union minister Prakash Javadekar announced on Tuesday that from April 1, all those above the age of 45- with or without co-morbidities - will be allowed to take the vaccine. The decision was taken on the basis of scientific advice, Javadekar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indias-vaccinating-rate-highest-in-the-world-health-minister-harsh-vardhan-101616496396830.html
23-03-2021||India||Almost 300% rise in cyber attacks in India in 2020, govt tells Parliament||Cyber attacks amid the Covid-19 pandemic rose by almost 300% last year in the country to reach 1,158,208 compared to 394,499 in 2019, the Union home ministry told Parliament on Tuesday, citing the data from Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-In).The ministry did not elaborate on the attacks or the profile of attackers. But cyber experts said the spike could be linked to an increase in online activity last year particularly during the lockdown imposed to check the Covid-19 spread. The experts blamed a lack of cybersecurity awareness for phishing and malware attacks.“CERT-In receives inputs from its situational awareness systems and threat intelligence sources about malware infections in networks of entities across sectors. Whenever any incident comes to notice of CERT-In, it issues alerts and advisories to the entities concerned and sectoral CERTs for remedial measures,” Union minister of state for home affairs G Kishan Reddy told Parliament. He was responding to a query on cyber attacks on India’s power supply and on a company supplying Covid-19 vaccines.Also Read | After power sector, transport ministry gets alert about attempted cyberattackEarlier this month, American cyber intelligence company Recorded Future said it uncovered a suspected China-linked cyber operation that was focused on India’s electricity grid and other critical infrastructure. While the company did not link a wide power outage in Mumbai to the operation, which it titled RedEcho, it did not rule out a link. Recorded Future said RedEcho deployed malware known as ShadowPad, which has been previously linked to Chinese cyber soldiers.Reddy said the government has issued guidelines to chief information security officers regarding their key roles and responsibilities for securing applications/infrastructure and compliance. “All the government websites and applications are audited with respect to cybersecurity prior to their hosting. The auditing of the websites and applications are conducted on a regular basis after hosting also. [The] government has empanelled security auditing organisations to support and audit [the] implementation of information security best practices.”Reddy said the government has formulated a Cyber Crisis Management Plan for countering cyber attacks for implementation by all ministries/ departments of the central government, state governments, and their organisations.He added the government is operating the Cyber Swachhta Kendra (Botnet Cleaning and Malware Analysis Centre). “The centre is providing detection of malicious programmes and free tools to remove the same.” Reddy said the government has set up the National Cyber Coordination Centre to generate necessary situational awareness of existing and potential cybersecurity threats.Pavan Duggal, a cyber law expert said, there are mainly two reasons for the increase in cyber-attacks last year. “...first, the fear and panic due to Covid-19, which cyber-criminals were able to weaponize to their benefit. Secondly, the work-from-home ensured that cyber security did not get the kind of attention it was supposed to get. It was far easier to breach the systems at home than at the workplace. But, keeping numbers aside, this can be called the golden age of cyber-crimes. The cyber breaches will be a new normal now with both state and non-state actors involved.”HT on Monday reported the Union transport ministry on Sunday received an alert from the Cert-IN regarding “targeted intrusion activities” directed towards the country’s transport sector with “possible malicious intentions”. This came after a slew of cybersecurity attacks on the Indian government’s domains over the past few months. On February 25, HT reported about new phishing emails using compromised government accounts to target groups of officials, attempting to lure them into sharing their passwords on a page that mirrored the government’s official mail server sign-on website.On February 21, HT also reported that the devices of multiple former defence personnel may have been compromised in a phishing attack launched through similar attacks carried out by government domain email addresses.Last year, the National Highways Authority of India reported a cyberattack on its email server and said prompt action resulted in no data loss. It shut down its server then as a precaution.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/almost-300-rise-in-cyber-attacks-in-india-in-2020-govt-tells-parliament-101616496416988.html

23-03-2021||India||PM Modi's visit to Bangladesh to bolster bilateral ties, says report||The visit of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to Dhaka on the eve of Bangladesh's 50th Independence Day on 26 March as the 'honoured guest' will not only be a diplomatic tour but also a bridge of the cultural connect of the two countries.PM Modi is slated to travel to Bangladesh on March 25-26 for the second time since 2015, his first-ever foreign tour after the Covid-19 pandemic.PM Modi's visit to Dhaka will be in connection with three epochal events - Mujib Borsho (birth centenary of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman); 50 years of the establishment of diplomatic ties between Bangladesh and India; and 50 years of Bangladesh liberation war, reported eureporter.Bangladesh-India relations are multifaceted in nature and rooted in a shared history, geographical proximity and commonality in their cultures. The emotional bonds stemming from the contribution of India towards the liberation of Bangladesh remain a dominant factor in the country's political, social and cultural web.Louis Auge, in an article in eureporter, states, "Economically and commercially, the two countries are becoming increasingly closer. Besides, the dependence of Bangladesh on the common river waters remains an ever-present reminder of the umbilical links between the two countries."Economic relations between these two countries have over the last couple of years become multifaceted, embracing trade transactions, joint ventures, transit facilities and transport development.Bangladesh is the recipient of India's largest-ever financial assistance. Prime Minister Modi, during his last visit to Dhaka (June 6-7, 2015), had announced that India would provide Bangladesh a Line of Credit of $2 billion. The credit carries the lowest ever one per cent interest rate with a repayment period of 20 years and a five-year grace period.These credit lines are used by Bangladesh to complete its 14 infrastructure and transport projects. Out of these 11 projects are in the railways' sector for the supply of locomotives, tank wagons, flat wagons and brake wagons to Bangladesh, as per eureporter.The private sector initiative comes in parallel to the Indian government's effort to bolster relations with Bangladesh. 38 Indian investments had been registered with the Board of Investments (BoI) in Bangladesh for about $183 million in the preceding years, writes Auge.Major Indian companies such as Bharti Airtel, Tata Motors, Sun Pharma, Asian Paints, Marico, Godrej, Venky's Hatcheries, Parle Products, Forbes and Marshall have invested in Bangladesh in the recent past. At the Bangladesh Investment and Policy Summit held in Dhaka in 2016, two big industrial groups of India, Reliance and Adani, committed to making huge investments in Bangladesh to the tune of $1,100 crores.Moreover, Dhaka's average economic growth rate has been over 7.0 per cent for the last couple of years, thereby attracting Indian investment.The middle class is rising steadily and creating demand for consumer goods and services. The country has also graduated as a developing nation.Further, the recent virtual summit between Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and PM Modi while inaugurating 'Maitri Setu' (Friendship Bridge) on March 9, has shifted the focus on regional connectivity.'Regional connectivity is not only strengthening friendship between Bangladesh and India but also proving to be a strong link of business', Hasina had remarked. PM Modi also expressed the view that connectivity between Bangladesh and India will prove to be very important for the north-east region of India and Bangladesh trade as well.Auge also focussed upon security aspects and said that Bangladesh-India relations have never been better. Bangladesh has already addressed major issues that remained matters of concern from India's security point of view for a long period. Bangladesh has handed over to India a large number of North-East Indian insurgents who had been camping and executing anti-India operations from Bangladeshi soil. Bangladesh government did this even though there was no extradition treaty between the two sides. Anup Chetia, a major United Liberation Front of Assam (ULFA) insurgent and a constant headache for the Indian security establishment, has also been handed over to India by the country.Bangladeshi security forces have seized huge stockpiles of explosive materials, broken up numerous camps and apprehended a number of Indian insurgents.Prime Minister Hasina has delivered on all of India's concerns ranging from security to connectivity. India on its part has done its best to reciprocate by giving priority to supply Covid 19 vaccine to Bangladesh, writes Auge.Many of the long outstanding problems that had existed since the partition of India in 1947 have been resolved. The most important of these being strengthening connectivity between the two countries through resuming the long suspended rail, road and waterway links.The exchange of enclaves and the long-standing border disputes were also solved and the Indian Parliament showed a rare gesture of good-will when both houses of the Indian Parliament unanimously voted to ratify the Mujib-Indira accord of 1974 agreeing to exchange adversely located enclaves and demark the boundaries, reported eureporter.Meanwhile, Teesta river water sharing continues to remain a nagging problem. PM Modi has indicated that the problem will be resolved during this tenure.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-s-visit-to-bangladesh-to-bolster-bilateral-ties-says-report-101616493610354.html
23-03-2021||India||Goa CM rules out making Covid test mandatory on arrival||Goa Chief Minister Pramod Sawant on Tuesday ruled out making Covid-19 testing mandatory for those entering the state saying that such a move could lead to shuttering to economic activity which the state couldn’t afford. On Monday, state Health Minister Vishwajit Rane told the media that he had ‘sent a file’ to the Chief Minister seeking that all arrivals into the state should either bring a negative certificate on arrival or be tested upon arrival in view of the increasing cases. “Yesterday there were 84 cases, prior to that there were 100. We should all take care including tourists coming to the state. We cannot once again close all economic activity. We have ramped up testing and am requesting all to maintain social distancing and use masks,” Sawant said. “I am in constant touch with the Health Minister. For now there is no decision to be taken (regarding testing on arrival) except that we will test on a bigger scale. Those who have signs and symptoms should get themselves tested and those who are eligible should get vaccinated,” Sawant said. “There are several neighbouring states such as Kerala, Maharashtra Karmnataka who have made it mandatory for people from Goa flying into those states to carry Covid-19 negative certificates, without which they don’t allow them entry into the states,” Rane had said on Monday.“We need to make Covid-19 negative certificates mandatory for people from other states, which already have such restrictions in place. The trouble has started from these states. They have put us in trouble. I am personally in favour of testing at the airport and on arrival. The proposal will be put before the Chief Minister,” Rane said.Goa has witnessed an uptick in cases and a rise in the number of active cases that now stand at 1017. The number of active cases was less than 700 a few weeks ago. The state’s tourism industry had expressed apprehensions that any restriction on arrival to the state would further dampen the already weak enthusiasm for travelling.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-cm-rules-out-making-covid-test-mandatory-on-arrival-101616494555018.html
23-03-2021||India||India delivers second batch of heavy equipment to Chabahar port||India has delivered the second consignment of heavy equipment, including two 100-tonne mobile cranes, to Iran’s Chabahar port, reflecting New Delhi’s commitment to the strategic connectivity and transit initiative. The cranes and other loading equipment reached the port on the Gulf of Oman on Sunday, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity. India had delivered the first consignment of heavy equipment, including two 140-tonne mobile harbour cranes, in January. “Continuing with our commitment to develop Chabahar Port, second shipment of equipment reaches Shahid Behesti Terminal,” minister of state for ports and shipping Mansukh Mandaviya said in a tweet. The new loading equipment is worth $7.5 million, said Behrouz Aghaei, director general of the ports and maritime department of Iran’s Sistan-Baluchestan province. This is part of the Indian side’s commitment to make a total investment of $85 million in the Iranian port under a long-term contract, he added. Farhad Montaser Kouhsari, the deputy head of Iran’s Ports and Maritime Organization, recently told the Iranian media that the new cranes supplied by the Indian side will help increase the annual loading and unloading rate at Chabahar to 20 million tonnes. More heavy equipment from the Indian side is expected in the coming months, Kouhsari said. Afghanistan, Iran and India signed a tripartite agreement on developing Chabahar port and setting up a trilateral transport and transit corridor in 2016. India then set up India Ports Global Limited to operate the Shahid Behesti terminal at Chabahar. The mobile harbour cranes provided in January are part of a contract for six such cranes, worth more than $25 million, with the Italian firm Italgru S.r.l. Last year, India cancelled a $30-million contract with Shanghai Zhenhua Heavy Industries for heavy cranes because of delays by the Chinese company in supplying the equipment ordered in 2017. India recently proposed that Chabahar port be included in the International North South Transport Corridor (INSTC), a 7,200-km multi-mode route spanning 13 countries. Despite Chabahar port being granted a waiver from US sanctions on Iran, India has faced problems in acquiring heavy equipment from foreign countries, mainly because of the reluctance of foreign banks to open letters of credit (LoCs) for a project within Iran. Since India Ports Global Limited began operations in December 2018, the port has handled 123 vessels, 13,752 containers and 1.8 million tonnes of cargo. There has been an increase in average monthly calls by merchant vessels, and 110,000 tonnes of wheat and 2,000 tonnes of pulses have been shipped to Afghanistan via Chabahar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-delivers-second-batch-of-heavy-equipment-to-chabahar-port-101616493174886.html

Most of these fire incidents have been in Maoist affected districts of the state where the reach of the forest department is less. Forest department officials claimed that till now total 13.51 square kilometers of forest has been affected in the bush fires which suggest that most of the fire incidents were small and were doused on time. Fire incidents between February 15 and June 15 are recorded in the forest fire season every year. “Around 20 per cent of total fire incidents were reported in Bijapur district and Udanti Sitanadi Forest Reserve in Gariyaband district. Both are Maoist affected districts of the state hence the reach of the forest department is less in comparison to other areas. Secondly, this year the season is dry compared to previous years and no rainfall was recorded, hence the fire incidents increased,” said Rakesh Chaturvedi, Principal Chief Conservator of Forest (PCCF). In Bijapur district total 705 fires were reported till Monday while in Udanti Sitanadi Tiger Reserve 599 incidents of fire were recorded. The official further claimed that the movement of people was less in 2020 due to the lockdown in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic and hence, a lesser number of fires - 4713 - were reported. In 2019, a total of 17,835 fire incidents were reported in the state and around 138 square kilometers of area was affected. “In 2021, most of these recorded fire incidents, till now, were minor and were contained by the department within an hour. The satellite system which alerts us for any fire incident in the jungle is very sensitive hence it alerts us even for small fire incidents. The local forest officials were alerted in most cases and the fires were contained within a few hours,” said OP Yadav, Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (Protection). Activists believe that most of these fires were reported in protected areas which indicates that the poachers and hunters are active in these areas. “Hunters burn forest to push the wild animal in a corner of a jungle so that they can kill or trap them. The figures suggest that the forest department should be more active in the jungle since the forest fire season continues till June,” said Amlendu Mishra, member of the State Wildlife Advisory Board. Some activists also alleged that the forest department was not prepared to contain fire incidents in the state. “The way fire incidents are reported in the state, it is clear that the department was not prepared and has not provided resources at village-level to contain incidents. These incidents also suggest that the management and protection of forests is possible only with the participation of the community and village. That is why under Community Forest Resources (CFR), the forest resources can be protected and managed only by handing over forest resources to the gram sabhas and empowering them,” said Alok Shukla, convener of Chhattisgarh Bachao Andolan. Sundeip Shrivasatva, an environmental activist, said that the government should focus on better forest management to contain fire incidents in the state. “Beat guards can play an important role. The forest department should clear dry leaves more effectively and ensure availability of water to douse fires,” said Shrivastava. “Forest fire destroys not only big trees but also herbs, insects, smaller vertebrates and their eggs. Also the grasslands are destroyed which in turn affects herbivorous animals. It hits the entire forest ecosystem. Further this is the time for forest produce collection particularly mahua. Forest department along with public support can stop forest fires,” Mishra added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/6520-forest-fires-scorch-chhattisgarh-in-last-37-days-101616492877203.html
23-03-2021||India||All those above 45 years will be eligible for Covid-19 vaccine from April 1||In a major move, the Union Cabinet on Tuesday decided to open the vaccination drive for everyone above the age of 45 years starting from April 1. Union minister Prakash Javadekar announced that there will be no need for medical certificates as evidence of co-morbidity conditions, as the government had stipulated earlier for the second phase of vaccination.The decision has been taken based on scientific advice, the minister said adding that the gap between Covishield doses has also been extended up to eight weeks, from its earlier four weeks, as this is more effective.Widen gap in Covishield jabs to 6-8 weeks: CentreIndia's vaccination drive entered the second phase from March 1 as senior citizens and people above the age of 45 years with co-morbidities were made eligible to receive the vaccine shots. For people between the age group of 45 and 59, medical certificates in proof of their health conditions were mandatory. But as the Centre is aiming to speed up the vaccination drive in the face of an alarming rise in the number of daily Covid-19 infections, now anyone above the age of 45 can get vaccinated, the Cabinet decided on Tuesday.In the past few weeks, several states have urged the Centre to open vaccination for all. Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Tuesday requested the Centre to include people younger than 60 years of age under the vaccination drive."Vaccination is going on well and at a fast pace. Around 4.85 crore people have already got vaccinated. Many of them have got their second doses too. 32.5 lakh doses were administered yesterday in 24 hours. In February, our daily average was 3.77 lakh, it surpassed 15 lakh in March," the minister said."Would urge everyone above 45 years to get themselves registered and inoculated," the minister said adding that adequate doses of vaccines are available at present in India. "We are proud that both of India's vaccines are successful. Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself took Covaxin. So you can take any vaccine. And take a doctor's advice regarding the gap between the two doses," Javadekar said.The vaccine is the only shield against Covid-19, the minister said, adding, "We will have to continue using masks for another one year and a half. Similarly, we will have to wash hands, maintain social distancing. Vaccination is the only shield."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vaccine-for-all-those-above-45-years-from-april-1-cabinet-clears-proposal-101616492383386.html

March 23 is observed as 'Shaheed Diwas' to pay tribute to the trio who were hanged for killing British police officer J P Saunders. The trio wanted to avenge the death of Lala Lajpat Rai.Earlier on December 19, the farmers organised a 'turban langar' at the Singhu border. The initiative at the Delhi-Haryana border was conducted by a group of volunteers from Punjab.In February this year, the farmers again marked the 'Pagdi Sambhal Divas' at the Delhi borders. Donning traditional turbans and singing songs of the peasant movement, the farmers protested against the three agri laws.Called by the Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM), the day-long event was inspired by the "Pagdi Sambhal Lehar" of 1906.Farmers have been protesting in and around the national capital since November 26 against the three farm laws -- the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020; and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.Enacted in September last year, the three farm laws have been projected by the Centre as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove the middlemen and allow farmers to sell their produce anywhere in the country.The protesting farmers, on the other hand, have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of the Minimum Support Price (MSP) and do away with the "mandi" (wholesale market) system, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/protesting-farmers-organise-pagdi-langar-at-ghazipur-border-on-shaheed-diwas-101616489114683.html

He was later suspended from service.On Monday morning, theATS team took accused Shinde to the residence of Waze in Thane and later to the creek in Mumbra were Hiran's body was found.Though the Hiran murder case was transferred to the NIA on March 20, the ATS is still conducting investigation.The ATS had lodged a murder case under section 302 (punishment for murder), 201 (causing disappearance of evidence of offence or giving false information to screen offender) 120B (criminal conspiracy) and 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code against unknown persons and on Saturday his murder case have been handed over to National Investigation Agency (NIA) for further probe, official added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hiran-murder-case-ats-seizes-high-end-car-from-daman-101616488674273.html

Singh said that the process needs to be expedited, pointing that experts have found the existing Covishield vaccine to be equally effective against the UK variant - B.1.1.7. “It was essential to vaccinate more and more people to break the chain of transmission,” he said, according to a statement released by his office.According to the statement, 81% of the latest 401 samples sent by the state for genome sequencing were positive for the new UK Covid variant.Also read | India sees slight dip in daily Covid-19 cases at 40,715, tally over 11.68 mnThe chief minister also urged people to strictly follow all Covid protocols, including wearing masks and maintaining social distancing.

The result of these samples was worrying as it showed the presence of B.1.1.7 variant in 326 Covid samples, said Dr Talwar,” the statement added.Singh, the statement said, has been informed by Dr Talwar that though this UK variant B.1.1.7 is more infectious yet not more virulent.Punjab along with Maharashtra, Karnataka, Gujarat, Chhattisgarh and Tamil Nadu collectively account for 80.90 per cent of the 40,715 infections reported in a span of 24 hours, according to the Union health ministry.

Though the CM expressed his concerns over the report and corruption in police transfers, he has kept quiet on the entire episode maybe because of political compulsions. Surprisingly, the report was forwarded to the home minister for further action. Since the entire matter relates to the transfer of IPS officers that come under the ministry of home affairs, I am meeting Union home secretary in Delhi on Tuesday evening. I will submit the records of the intercepted calls and a copy of the report to him, and will demand a CBI inquiry,” Fadnavis said.Also Read | After Pawar’s remark on Anil Deshmukh, Fadnavis accuses him of diverting issueFadnavis claimed that Jaiswal opted for Central deputation because he was disillusioned that no action was taken on the report. He added that Shukla’s promotion as director general was also blocked by the government. He also alleged that officers whose names came up in the intercepted calls managed to land plum postings.On home minister Anil Deshmukh’s February meeting with now suspended police officer Sachin Vaze, an allegation made by former Mumbai police chief Param Bir Singh, Fadnavis produced police records listing out the minister’s movement when he was reportedly in home quarantine. “Sharad Pawar saheb yesterday said that Deshmukh was home quarantined from February 15 till the end of the month. But the police records show that he attended meetings at Sahyadri guest house on February 17 and 24. Pawarsaheb has been given wrong information and thus, his attempts to shield Deshmukh have failed,” he said.Responding to Fadnavis’s allegations, state health minister and NCP leader Rajesh Tope said, “The investigation into all these allegations have already been ordered and all the facts will come to the fore. Appropriate action will be taken after that.”Maharashtra Congress’s general secretary and spokesperson Sachin Sawant also said, “Fadnavis has been diverting the main issue of Antilia bomb scare by raising other matters not related to it. He has not been able to give evidence related to the bomb scare and Mansukh Hiran’s death case. The call interception by Rashmi Shukla is under scanner over the permissions for them.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fadnavis-demands-cbi-probe-in-alleged-corruption-in-police-transfers-101616485314462.html

The pilots said that they faced the brunt of unjust pay cuts of around 58% from April 2020 and 55% from October 2020. They asked the airline to pay them their full salary as they have been the first and constant ones to serve the nation throughout the pandemic when they operated repatriation flights during the peak of Covid-19.“By taking away the fixed pay, which is the industry norm, pilots infected with this deadly virus could not operate flights and earn their rightful livelihood similar to other pilots. It is unfair to deny these pilots their monthly flying allowance despite them being available to the company and remaining unutilised due to varied reasons lain alongside the pandemic,” ICPA said.Also Read | Address concerns on bookings, refunds: Country’s largest tourism body to Air IndiaThe pilots also questioned the airline on amending international layover allowances to government rates instead of referring to the aviation industry standards for allowances. A member pilot said,“The international layover allowance should be paid at par with industry-standard or rather, the Ministry of civil aviation (MoCA) should treat us at par with other public sector undertakings while considering any pay cut from March 2020.”The ICPA said that while the Indian aviation industry is set on the road to recovery, and all private airlines have scaled back the severity measures by a vast margin, denying wages and allowances to the pilots of Air India, Air India Express and Alliance Air defies a rational justification.The letter written to Puri read, “...We have long lost hope that our management will ever stand by us or fulfil its responsibilities to Air India and its pilots. We request you to kindly intervene to restore our rightful wages and allowances in line with current Industry practices and standards..”Air India did not comment on the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ai-airbus-pilots-body-writes-to-minister-puri-for-pay-as-per-industry-standards-101616482794198.html
23-03-2021||India||Supreme Court waives compound, penal interests on loans during moratorium||The Supreme Court on Tuesday ordered banks against charging borrowers any penal interest or compound interest (interest on interest) on loans during the moratorium on repayment of loans from March to August 2020 in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. It rejected a request by individuals and traders’ associations for waiver of complete interest during the moratorium. The court refused to extend the moratorium or tinker with the resolution mechanism proposed by Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to waive compound interest on six categories of loans up to ₹ 2 crore.A bench of Justices Ashok Bhushan, RS Reddy, and MR Shah issued the order on a clutch of petitions filed by corporate bodies, business associations, and individuals demanding extension of moratorium beyond August.At the instance of the court, the Centre agreed to waive compound interest on loans for six categories. The business associations and corporate bodies had demanded the extension of this benefit to borrowers with loans of above ₹2 crore.Also Read | Government planning crackdown on apps offering cash loans onlineThe bench said courts are not experts and such decisions lie in the realm of economic policy in which interference should be rarely made.It added the Covid-19 pandemic affected even the government. The bench said the Centre and RBI still came out with schemes and packages to reduce stress on businesses and granting any further relief would have consequences on the economy.The court clarified any penal interest or compound interest charged by banks for non-payment of any loan amount during moratorium shall be refundable. And if the bank is not in a position to refund, the same shall be adjusted in the loan amount, it added.The bench said decisions on economic policy matters should be left to the government and courts should not interfere even if a second view is possible.During the hearing of these cases, the Centre and RBI argued that compound interest on loans of up to ₹two crore was waived keeping in mind fiscal constraints and the viability of banks. Any order to further extend the benefit to other borrowers will make banks inviable, which an economy like India will be unable to sustain, the Centre and RBI argued.Some petitioners questioned the ceiling limit of ₹2 crore for waiving compound interest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-waives-compound-penal-interests-on-loans-during-moratorium-101616482074879.html

23-03-2021||India||Explained: Ken-Betwa river interlinking project and environmental concerns||Union Jal Shakti minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat signed a tripartite agreement with the states of Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh on Monday on the occasion of World Water Day to start the work on India’s first major river interlinking project that will connect the Ken and the Betwa Rivers. The Memorandum of Agreement (MoA) was signed almost 18 years after the idea of the project was conceived owing to disagreement between the two states over sharing of water. Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan said that the project will help in irrigating at least 1 million hectares of land and people of nine districts of the state will benefit from it.What is the Ken-Betwa interlinking project?The project is part of the National Perspective Plan aimed at interlinking rivers of the country. According to the project report, 2,800 million cubic metres (MCM) of water from the Ken River basin will be diverted to the water-deficient Betwa basin through a 73.8-meter-high dam proposed on Ken at Daudhan in Madhya Pradesh’s Chhattarpur district. Both of the rivers are rain-fed and are tributaries of the Yamuna. The project, which is estimated to take eight years to complete, has an estimated cost of ₹35,111.24 crore.Read more: Climate change likely to affect Maharashtra’s agricultural productivity: StudyWhat is the history of the Ken-Betwa interlinking project?The project was conceptualised in the 1980s but the water-sharing agreement could not be reached between the two states. The work on the project was originally slated to begin in 2015 but only got a fresh push last year with the government making a revised deal with the two states.What are the environmental concerns?Several committees, including the Supreme Court-appointed panel, have raised doubts about the project. Environmental activists say that the project will be very harmful to the Panna Tiger reserve, which is located in Madhya Pradesh and is home to more than 52 tigers and endangered vulture species like the white-rumped vulture. Himanshu Thakkar, convenor of South Asia Network on Dams, River and People said that the decision to interlink the rivers was “very unfortunate” and cited a report of the forest advisory committee which said that an estimated 4.6 million trees will be cut down for the project which will adversely affect the rain in the already dry Bundelkhand region.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/explained-ken-betwa-river-interlinking-project-and-environmental-concerns-101616479775802.html
23-03-2021||India||About 300 sequenced Covid-19 samples found to be of UK, SA, Brazilian variants||At least 284 samples that tested positive for Sars-CoV-2, which causes Covid-19, across the country have been found to be of the UK variant, officials aware of the matter said. Another 11 turned out to be of the South African and one of the Brazilian variants. All three contain the N501Y mutation that makes them more transmissible. The South African and Brazilian variants also carry the E484K mutation that helps them evade some of the immune responses generated by a previous infection or through vaccination. A report in the British Medical Journal said the UK variant may increase the risk of mortality from 2.5 deaths per 1,000 detected cases to 4.1.The Indian Sars-CoV-2 Genomic Consortia (INSACOG) was set up to conduct genomic surveillance of the strains of the virus when reports about the UK variant emerged in January. The government announced the consortium will sequence 5% of all the positive cases in the country.Also Read | Centre wants gap in Covishield jabs widened to 4-8 weeks: All you need to knowThe consortium received 19,092 RT-PCR positive samples for sequencing as of March 10 with the highest from Kerala (5,191), followed by Maharashtra (2,826), and Rajasthan (1,963). Delhi submitted 1,232 samples to the consortium, which is almost 14% of the total cases reported between January 22 and March 10.The sequencing of 4,869 samples was completed by March 10, the government told Parliament.INSACOG has detected E484K mutations in some of the samples collected from Maharashtra.Rakesh Mishra, director of the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB), said there is no evidence to suggest that the current surge in the number of cases has anything to do with mutant viruses. “This is because the proportion of samples that contain these variants is very small – about 6% of the total. The increase is likely driven by the behaviour of the people. Everything has gone back to normal – marriages are happening, elections are happening, schools are opening up,” said Mishra. “We are also looking for the new local variant, but we are yet to pick up any that is circulating faster or is of any concern. And, no matter what variant it is, the same mask will protect us from all.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/about-300-sequenced-covid-19-samples-found-to-be-of-uk-sa-brazilian-variants-101616479494455.html
23-03-2021||India||Maritime, air defence theatre commands to be announced by June 2021||When Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed the Combined Commanders Conference at Kevadia in Gujarat on March 6, the first signs of joint manship among the three services were more than evident. The Indian Air Force commanders were wearing Indian Army’s combat disruptive camouflage uniform to signal joint spirit and Indian Navy commanders were in their dark grey disruptive camouflage gear.While PM Modi impressed on joint manship and synergy among the forces, the three services led by the Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) meant business as if spurred by the 100-day eyeball to eyeball stand-off with China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) in east Ladakh. “It was not a business conference of the past. The commanders were told to be battle-ready at all times with the inter-services silos showing signs of breaking and giving way to new military reform,” said a senior commander.Also read | Next round of India-China talks looks positive on Gogra-Hot SpringsPM Modi’s address not only charged up the commanders but also has speeded up the process of creation of theatres commands with the announcement of key maritime theatre command and air defence command expected by June this year. The maritime and air defence command will be raised by the 75th year of Indian Independence.The fact is that the PLA’s aggression against India in east Ladakh has really made the Indian military much more responsive and ready for battle than ever before. When the Indian Army was standing up to PLA in Galwan, Gogra-Hot Springs and Pangong Tso, the air force was aggressively patrolling the skies and the navy was harassing Chinese warships with submarines as far as the Gulf of Aden. This posture continues with the navy now questioning each Chinese survey ship, trying to map the Indian Ocean in the name of the mineral and heavy metals survey.Also read | East Ladakh stand-off with China on US top official Lloyd Austin’s India agendaWhile the IAF is awaiting its next instalment of Rafale fighters from France, the navy is preparing to receive its first of the 24 MH-60R Seahawk multi-role helicopters from the US this year. Called a “ship on a ship” the Seahawk helicopter is a command and control machine proficient in anti-submarine warfare with torpedoes, anti-surface warfare with Hell-Fire missiles and functions as an attack helicopter at sea in a special operations role. The navy will also get six more Boeing P8I, known for anti-submarine warfare, anti-surface warfare and ship interdiction, from the US. “The Indian Navy, henceforth, will project force in the entire Indo-Pacific. The time has come for deployment as the era of naval diplomacy is over,” said a senior Admiral.The new-found attitude of the Indian Army is exemplified by its XIV Corps Commander Lt General PGK Menon, who meets his Chinese counterparts on equal footing if not more. With all the aggressive attitude of a Sikh Regiment soldier, Lt Gen Menon has asked his troops to patrol up to designated points on the Line of Actual Control (LAC) and be prepared for the worst-case scenario. The same mood prevails all along the LAC.Another attribute of the fundamental changes taking place within the Indian military establishment is accountability from the Military Engineer Services and looking at the Indian private sector and not only the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) for the completion of the Aatmanirbhar Bharat mission. In this context, DRDO is being questioned on delays in the development of weapon systems as well as indigenous content in the proven systems like Brahmos missile, Arjun tank and Tejas fighter. The Indian armed forces finally have decided to shrug off their imperial baggage and are prepared for a more professional tri-service future.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maritime-air-defence-theatre-commands-to-be-announced-by-june-2021-101616478448044.html

Everyday hundreds of trucks leave a huge trail of dust while passing by our homes. How long should we face the pollution by trucks carrying coal,” asked Anjana Pradhan, one of the children sitting on dharna.The school children, most of them Hill khadia, Bhuyan and Gond tribals, are the latest to join the protest against coal transportation that started in Hemgir block on January 19 this year. Over 5,000 tribals of Sundargarh started a road blockade at Taparia area to stop the trucks carrying coal from Sundargarh to Chhattisgarh. The villagers had a temporary relief when the Odisha Human Rights Commission on February 10 ordered a ban on movement of trucks on the village roads for up to six weeks. But the relief was short-lived after Orissa High Court on March 9 stayed the recommendations of OHRC when the state government petitioned through Mahanadi Coalfields Limited.Prominent activist Prafulla Samantra who visited the area said the situation is becoming volatile. “The people have a constitutional right to protest peacefully the state fails to protect their right to clean air and clean water. But people who are protesting the coal dust pollution are being arrested arbitrarily without any reason. A few days ago women along with children of anganwadi Centre of Kandadhuda, Ratanpur and Beleimunda villages were forcefully taken to police station and kept there for 30 hours without food. Around two dozen villagers including 12 women were sent to jail on false charges of attempt to murder and dacoity. Social activist Sura Mishra has been slapped with a dacoity case as he supported the villagers’ protest,” said Samantra.Sundargarh sub-collector Abhimanyu Behera said a new corridor for the trucks has been planned to be built at a cost of ₹146 crore.“The construction of the corridor would soon start. But till the new road is made the villagers should not try to block the trucks. We have ordered MCL to transport the coal by covering with tarpaulins,” he said.Meanwhile, coal transportation on Bankibahal-Taparia road, which resumed on March 11, had stopped from March 15 following the protest at Ratanpur village.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/school-children-in-odisha-s-sundargarh-district-protest-pollution-by-coal-trucks-101616476974013.html

"Salute to the revolutionaries of Independence, Martyrs Veer Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru on Martyrdom Day. The sacrifice of these great sons of mother India will remain an inspiration for every generation of the country. Jai Hind! #ShaheedDiwas," the PM Modi wrote in a tweet in Hindi.Vice president M Venkaiah Naidu also paid his tributes. “My humble tributes to the fearless freedom fighters, Bhagat Singh, Shiva Ram Rajguru and Sukhdev Thapar, on their martyrdom day today. Their indomitable courage and love for our motherland inspired many to join the freedom movement,” Naidu also tweeted.Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh paid floral tributes to the martyrs and said in a tweet, “Their unparalleled courage, when they gladly embraced death in the cause of India’s freedom, will continue to inspire generations. Jai Hind!”Martyr’s Day is observed every year on March 23 in India to mark the anniversary of the hanging of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev Thapar, and Shivaram Rajguru. The three young freedom fighters were hanged by the Britishers on March 23, 1931, in Lahore Jail.Bhagat Singh, who was born on September 28, 1907, in Punjab's Lyallpur, fought against the British with his companions Rajguru and Sukhdev. Sukhdev, who was born on May 15, 1907, in Ludhiana, came in contact with Singh in 1921 when the latter was a student of National College. Sukhdev later joined the underground revolutionary organisation, Hindustan Republican Association (HRA), which included Singh, Rajguru and Chandrashekhar Azad.Singh, Rajguru and Sukhdev were deeply affected by the assassination of Lala Lajpat Rai who was killed in a non-violent protest against the Simon Commission on October 30, 1928. The British lathi-charged the protesters and during the brutal attack, Rai was injured and eventually died of a heart attack.Singh and his partners decided to strike back at the British and in 1929 threw a bomb at the central legislative assembly in Delhi while cheering the slogan ‘Inquillab Zindabad’ (long live the revolution). Bhagat Singh, Rajguru and Sukhdev were hanged to death by the British in 1931 and were cremated on the banks of the Sutlej River.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/martyrs-day-2021-pm-modi-vice-president-naidu-pay-tributes-101616475664743.html
23-03-2021||India||Supreme Court seeks status of vacancies in tribunals||The Supreme Court on Monday directed the Centre to provide information by Thursday on vacancies across tribunals and stages at which the appointment processes are held up. The direction came as the court expressed displeasure over inaction in filling vacancies at the National Green Tribunal (NGT) despite the approval for them from the Appointments Committee of the Cabinet (ACC).“We need concrete data on the names cleared by the search-cum-selection committee on not just the National Green Tribunal (NGT) but the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal, Armed Forces Tribunal, etc,” said a bench of Justices AM Khanwilkar and Dinesh Maheshwari.The court was hearing a petition filed by the NGT Bar Association (Western Zone) highlighting vacancies at the tribunal even as the NGT Act provides for a maximum of 20 judicial and 20 technical members as the tribunal’s ideal strength. The tribunal should not have less than 10 members from the judicial and technical sides at any given time.“...there are only five members (three judicial and two expert members) besides Chairperson at the Principal Bench, Delhi, and the pendency of cases at the tribunal has scaled the 2,500-mark,” said lawyer Raj Panjwani, who represented the association.The Supreme Court suggested a change in the composition of the search-cum-selection committees, which recommend names for appointment of chairpersons and members of tribunals, under the Tribunals, Appellate Tribunal, and Other Authorities (Qualification, Conditions of Service of Members) Rules in November. This came as the court was considering the validity of rules for filling up posts in tribunals across the country.Also Read | Delhi HC restrains Future, upholds Singapore tribunal’s ruling“In case the search-cum-selection committees have made recommendations after conducting selections in accordance with the 2020 Rules, appointments shall be made within three months from today and shall not be subject matter of challenge on the ground that they are not in accord with this judgment,” the court said.In an affidavit filed in January, the Centre told the court that seven names had been cleared for NGT appointments to bring it in conformity with the November judgment. The search-cum-selection committee cleared their names in September following which ACC approval came in December.Additional Solicitor General N Venkataraman told the court that he required three weeks to compile data on all tribunals where appointments were held up despite clearance of names.“All the orders we have passed are going down the drain. All tribunals are waiting for appointments. Almost every month, new vacancies are getting created. You [Centre] have to sort out this matter. If the selection process is complete, you must take it to the logical conclusion,” the court said and posted the matter for hearing on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-seeks-status-of-vacancies-in-tribunals-101616474573865.html
23-03-2021||India||Night curfew returns to Odisha’s Malkangiri district after 3 months||Authorities in Odisha’s southern district of Malkangiri clamped night curfew on Monday between March 23 and 31 to stop the spread of Covid-19 in view of a series of upcoming festivals.It is for the first time in three months that night curfew has been reimposed in the district.Though Malkangiri has no active Covid-19 cases currently and did not report any new positive cases on Monday, district collector Yeddula Vijay imposed the night curfew in view of the Bada Yatra, Dola Jatra and Holi festivities in different parts of the district. The order issued by the district administration said no one can venture out of their homes between 9 pm and 6 am for the next nine days except for essential activities.The night curfew order came on a day Odisha reported 146 new Covid-19 cases, its single-day highest in the last two months with Bhubaneswar’s premier B-school Xavier Institute of Management reporting 45 cases.“The institute has been sealed and close watch is being maintained. All the 45 positive cases are asymptomatic and all of them had travelled to Rajasthan, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu recently,” said special relief commissioner (SRC) Pradip Jena. Jena, who reviewed the preparedness of the state government to tackle rising infections, on Monday asked all district collectors and superintendents of police to strictly enforce Covid-19 guidelines in marketplaces, malls and other commercial establishments across the state. The SRC said already restrictions have been clamped in the state for Holi and Dola Purnima this weekend. “We do not want to unnecessarily clamp restrictions but if the situation needs, we will take an appropriate call,” said Jena hinting at a possibility of a lockdown once again.The SRC said panchayati raj institution (PRI) members like sarpanch, ward members and panchayat samiti members as well as anganwadi workers would be deployed in the fight against Covid resurgence. Chief minister Naveen Patnaik is expected to review the situation on Tuesday.The detection of the large number of cases from XIMB prompted the Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation officials to restrict the participation of people in Dola Purnima. In an order, the BMC said a maximum of 6 people would be allowed to take part in Dolajatra. All six must wear masks. In Ganjam district, which had become a Covid hotspot in July-August last year, the administration made RT-PCR test report compulsory for people visiting the district from places like Surat.Ganjam district collector Vijay Amruta Kulange said entry into the district will be allowed only to people with health-related issues. Those without RT-PCR reports will have to undergo mandatory home quarantine for seven days.“As festivals like Danda Nacha and Yatras are approaching, residents of Ganjam district who are settled outside Odisha for jobs or business will return to their homes. Therefore, I request the concerned organisers not to invite them for the festivals. I also urge the non-resident Odias not to visit the district only to participate in these festivals,” appealed Kulange, warning that if the district administration received reports of devotees coming to the district from outside stations for Danda Yatra, the celebrations will be cancelled.He said that lockdown and shutdown situations may return to the district if safety precautions are not followed by citizens.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/night-curfew-returns-to-odisha-s-malkangiri-district-after-3-months-101616473435133.html

The demonstration included a live video-conferencing with quantum key encrypted signals between two line-of-sight buildings at Space Application Centre in Ahmedabad.This experiment can form the basis for a future quantum key encrypted data transmission between satellites and ground stations. A satellite-based quantum encrypted communication can be used to create a network for sharing secret messages. “This is a major milestone achievement for unconditionally secured satellite data communication using quantum technologies,” said Isro in a release.Also Read | Space Technology Incubation Centres opened at NIT Nagpur, Bhopal and RourkelaQuantum cryptography “future proofs” any data transmission as the encryption cannot be cracked by existing computers. The current data security – for sensitive information such as banking – depends on large prime factorisation problems. A present day computer will be able to tell that the prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3 but it would not be able to do so for a number that is big enough.For that, quantum computers are needed. There is no country that has figured out how to develop one yet, but they are all in the race to do so.Computers around us work on a system of silicon transistors that store information as bits – either in the state of 0 or 1 –on a binary logic analogous to an on-off switch. But quantum computers use qubits – either a proton or an electron – that can exist as O, 1 or any superposition of any possible combination of 0 and 1.The space agency is now gearing up to demonstrate the technology between two Indian ground stations.A number of key technologies were developed indigenously for the demonstration including a NavIC receiver for time synchronization between the transmitter and receiver modules. NavIC or Navigation with Indian Constellation is India’s regional version of satellite-based positioning system.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/isro-demonstrates-technology-for-quantum-encrypted-data-transmission-101616473433925.html

Here is all you need to know about the MoA and why has it alarmed environmentalists:• Environmental activists said the project would spell doom for the Panna tiger reserve, known for its critically endangered white-rumped vultures besides a thriving big cat population.• According to the project report, 2,800 million cubic metres (MCM) of water will be diverted from the Ken basin to the water-deficient Betwa basin through a 73.8-meter-high dam proposed on Ken at Daudhan in Madhya Pradesh’s Chhattarpur district.• The report also said 6,017 hectares of forest land of Panna Tiger Reserve and the Ken Ghariyal Sanctuary would be submerged in the dam reservoir.• Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan said people of nine districts will benefit from the project and about 1 million hectares of land will get irrigated. • He added 6.2 million people, mostly in the water deficit Bundelkhand region, will get drinking water.Also Read | Ken-Betwa project could hit wildlife: Report• Himanshu Thakkar, convenor of South Asia Network on Dams, River and People said it was “very unfortunate” that the Central and state governments signed the MoA on World Water Day even though the project would prove to be a curse for water conservation. • He cited a report of the forest advisory committee and added an estimated 4.6 million trees will be cut down for the project. This will lead to poor rainfall in an already parched Bundelkhand. • Thakkar said the project will also destroy Panna Tiger Reserve, home to over 52 tigers and several species of endangered vultures, including the white-rumped vulture. • Of the nine vulture species found in India, six can be seen in Panna, which has run a successful vulture population revival programme.• Several committees, including the Supreme Court-appointed Central Empowered Committee have raised doubts about the project. • A petition opposing the approval of the project is pending before the Supreme Court.• Former environment minister Jairam Ramesh said the project will all but destroy the Panna Tiger Reserve, a success story in translocation and revival. • The MoA was signed 18 years after the project was first conceived.• Officials said the delay was because of lack of agreement between the two states on sharing of water.• The Uttar Pradesh government, which was initially demanding 930 MCM water during the Rabi season, settled for 750 MCM while Madhya Pradesh will receive 1,834 MCM water.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mp-up-sign-ken-betwa-pact-here-s-why-it-alarmed-environmentalists-101616471813855.html

Entitled "H2Ooooh! - Waterwise program for children of India", this innovative initiative encouraged school students between the age of 6-14 years to submit story ideas for animated short films to raise awareness on water conservation and its sustainable use.As many as 93 shortlisted students, including eight children with disabilities, underwent a training in basics of 2D animation including script writing, character sketching and storyboarding by Toonz Animation mentors as part of the programme. The students had been shortlisted after multiple screenings from over 17,000 participants from 43 schools across the country."We thank all our partners for this unique initiative, through which we hope children learned about the importance of water, which has enormous value for households, food, culture, health, education, economics and the integrity of our natural environment", said Eric Falt, UNESCO New Delhi Director."Creativity of children and youth is boundless. I compliment UNESCO in coming up with this innovative idea to make them #WaterWise through animation films and learn while doing.

23-03-2021||India||Supreme Court to pronounce order on loan moratorium extension today||The Supreme Court on Tuesday will pronounce its order on the extension of moratorium offered by Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on loan instalments accrued during March to August 2020 when a nationwide lockdown was imposed to curb the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic. A bench of justices Ashok Bhushan, RS Reddy and MR Shah will pronounce its decision on a clutch of petitions filed by corporate bodies, business associations and individuals demanding an extension of the moratorium beyond August 2020. At the instance of the court, the Centre had agreed to waive compound interest on loans for six categories of borrowers who secured loans of up to ₹2 crore. The various business associations and corporate bodies have demanded an extension of this benefit to borrowers who obtained loans of amounts beyond ₹2 crore.Also Read | Government planning crackdown on apps offering cash loans onlineThe Centre and RBI have opposed these requests. Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, representing the Centre, and senior advocate V Giri representing RBI, said that compound interest on loans of up to ₹2 crore was waived keeping in mind fiscal constraints and viability of banks. Any order to further extend the benefit to other borrowers will make banks unviable, which no economy like India will be able to sustain, the Centre and RBI had argued. Big borrowers like power producers, real estate developers, textile mill owners, knitwear association, jewellery manufacturing association, contract carriage operators, hotel and restaurant associations of states, financial technical institutions, and shopping centre associations are all represented before the Supreme Court. These petitioners had either obtained big loans (of over ₹1,500 crore) and not-so-big loans (of up to ₹1,500 crore) and expected some relief from the court as businesses were severely hit during the lockdown. Some petitioners even questioned the ceiling limit of ₹2 crore for waiving of compound interest. The RBI and Centre have maintained that problems of big borrowers were remedied by the KV Kamath Committee which fixed parameters for sector-specific resolution for industries and businesses under stress due to the pandemic. The RBI had filed an affidavit in Supreme Court last October stating that the moratorium on loan repayment cannot be extended beyond six months and requested the court to lift the stay on classifying defaulting accounts as non-performing assets (NPA) passed by the top court on September 3, 2020. The court had held, “The accounts which were not declared NPA till August 31, 2020 shall not be declared NPA till further orders.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-to-pronounce-order-on-loan-moratorium-extension-today-101616470793972.html

23-03-2021||India||One year of lockdown: Where India stands now?||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on March 23 last year announced a stringent lockdown in the country for 21 days to curb the spread of the coronavirus pandemic. One year on, Wednesday will mark a complete year of the restrictions in the country even as the Covid-19 threat is far from over."This virus has been spreading very fast across the world. It spreads like wildfire. Looking at the experience of these countries, and what the experts say, the only successful way to tackle the spread of the virus is social distancing,” PM Modi said while announcing the lockdown.Along with many countries around the world, India is also witnessing a surge in the daily Covid-19 cases. The country's death toll has mounted to 159,967 and its infection tally is above 11.64 million. At the time of the lockdown announcement last year, the infection tally was around 500 and 50 people had died due to the viral disease.The lockdownThe lockdown came into effect from midnight on March 24. All establishments, including private, commercial, educational and government, were asked to remain shut. At the time of his address, PM Modi described the situation as a "curfew" like. "Every state, every Union territory, every district, every village and every locality is being put under a lockdown. This is in effect a curfew, more stringent than the Janta Curfew,” the Prime Minister said while explaining the new measure.Limiting the movement of the entire 1.38 billion people, India's nationwide lockdown was one of the most stringent lockdowns in the world.The aftermathFor many industries lockdown became a transformative time as they tried to reinvent themselves according to the new norms. Among this was health industries, OTT platforms, e-commerce companies, whereas, travel, tourism, hospitality and related sector took the worst hit and are still in a process of recovery.The lockdown also triggered a massive exodus of migrants due to the shutdown of factories and the workplace. Millions of migrant workers walked or cycled hundreds of kilometres to go back to their native villages, triggering a countrywide outrage and criticism of the Centre.Covid-19 situation nowToday, there are more than 2,400 laboratories in the country that conduct Covid-19 testing through multiple mediums. According to the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR), out of the 2,425 labs, 545 government facilities conduct tests through RT-PCR. While 637 others conduct testing through TrueNat Test. At the time of the beginning of the pandemic, the number was just around 100.In terms of testing samples in a day, the country has improved its numbers to multiple folds. Until March 16 last year, India tested 9,100 samples for Covid-19. At that time India was among the lowest in the world in terms of people tested with respect to population. Today, the number is in millions. As of March 21, the country tested 3,44,45,774 samples for Covid-19, according to the ICMR figures. It tested 880,655 samples on March 21 alone.India has two vaccines—Covishield developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca and being manufactured by the Serum Institute of India and Bharat Biotech's Covaxin. It is also the second country after the United States to inoculate the highest number of people. As of March 21, the country immunised 4,50,65,998 people in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/one-year-of-lockdown-where-india-stands-now-101616470205132.html

Here is all you need to know about the move and what prompted it:• The decision is likely to also help cover more people during the current vaccination campaign as it will allow hospitals and clinics to give out more first doses to people instead of worrying about stocking adequate supplies for second doses for the time being.• A Union health ministry statement cited emerging scientific evidence and added the interval between two doses of Covishield has been revisited by the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation and subsequently by the National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for Covid-19.

Sadly, even after 74 years of Independence, we are still discussing the same issue...Although the reality is sad, it should not demotivate us. As long as we are a nation which continues to face such dual realities, such discussions must continue,” said justice Ramana, who is also the executive chairman of the National Legal Services Authority (NALSA). Justice Ramana is expected to take over as the Chief Justice of India (CJI) next month.Underscoring the significance of free legal aid, the judge urged lawyers to extend a helping hand to those who could not afford legal fees by extending them legal services for free as a part of their duty towards the society.Justice Ramana also highlighted that more than a million people were provided legal assistance between November 2019 and February 2021 through legal services clinics while ₹218.81 crores was awarded as compensation during the same period under the Victim Compensation Scheme.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/poverty-illiteracy-hinder-access-to-justice-apex-court-judge-nv-ramana-101616468272464.html

In 2020, suspended Jammu and Kashmir deputy superintendent of police Davinder Singh was arrested in connection with the case.In its charge sheet, filed in a Jammu special court, the agency alleged that Parra, a close aide of J&K former chief minister and PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti, was a crucial player in sustaining the “political-separatist-terrorist” nexus, apart from financing the activities of the Hizbul Mujahideen. “The investigations revealed that charge-sheeted accused Parra was part of the conspiracy for raising and transferring of terror funds to Hizbul Mujahideen (HM) militants for procurement of terrorist hardware and was also a crucial player in sustaining political-separatist-terrorist nexus in J&K,” said NIA spokesperson Jaya Roy.Others named in the charge sheet include Shaheen Ahmad Lone and Tafazul Hussain Parimoo for their alleged involvement in gunrunning from across the Line of Control (LoC), Roy added.On November 25 last year, the central agency arrested Parra after multiple rounds of questioning.A PDP spokesperson refused to comment on the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nia-says-mehbooba-mufti-key-player-in-terror-funding-case-101616467964597.html
23-03-2021||India||Param Bir Singh moves Supreme Court for CBI probe against Anil Deshmukh||Shunted out over the case of explosives being found in an abandoned SUV outside billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s residence, Antilia and the subsequent arrest of suspended police officer Sachin Vaze in the case, former Mumbai Police Commissioner Param Bir Singh moved the Supreme Court on Monday, demanding a CBI probe against Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh for allegedly running a “money collection scheme” through the police department.In writ petition, Singh claimed that he was transferred to a low-key post in Mumbai Police’s Home Guards by an order on March 17 “immediately” after he brought the corrupt practices of Deshmukh to the knowledge of Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar and some other senior leaders in the state government.“The petitioner has invoked writ jurisdiction of this Hon’ble Court to seek unbiased, uninfluenced, impartial and fair investigation in the corrupt malpractices of Shri Anil Deshmukh, the Hon’ble Home Minister of Government of Maharashtra, before the evidence are destroyed,” said Singh’s petition, filed through advocate Abhinay.It contended that NCP leader Deshmukh held various meetings in February 2021 at his residence with police officers, including Sachin Vaze of Crime Intelligence Unit, Mumbai and Sanjay Patil, ACP (Social Service Branch), Mumbai, bypassing their seniors, and asked them to collect ₹100 crores every month from establishments such as bars, hookah parlours, restaurants.“The Home Minister has been instructing them to carry out official assignments and collection schemes, including financial transactions as per his instructions based on his expectations and targets to collect money,” said Singh, adding it was imperative to order a CBI probe before the CCTV camera footage at Deshmukh’s residence is destroyed.Singh has also submitted that he was being made a “scapegoat to divert attention” in the Antilla case, highlighting that while there were vertically five officers between him and Vaze, Deshmukh was the one meeting Vaze at his residence.In that case, now being investigated by the National Investigation Agency, Vaze has already been arrested. The state ATS has also named Vaze the main accused in the death of Mansukh Hiran who was in possession of the SUV found with the explosives, but reported it stolen a few days before the incident.Alleging that Deshmukh had also been interfering with investigations into several other cases, Singh claimed that the home minister pressured him “to probe the role of certain leaders of the Bharatiya Janata Party and somehow implicate them” in the abetment to suicide case of Mohan Delkar, the seven-time Lok Sabha MP from Dadar and Nagar Haveli who was found dead in a hotel in Mumbai’s Marine Drive area on February 22.“Fair CBI investigation is thus warranted in each of such acts of Shri Anil Deshmukh in abuse of the official position of the Hon’ble Home Minister,” said the petition. It added that Singh approached the top court for a CBI probe since the Maharashtra government has withdrawn its general consent for the central agency to carry out investigation in the state.Singh is likely to be represented in the top court by senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi. The petition is still to get a date of hearing in the top court.Singh, in his plea, has also called the decision to transfer him “a political move with oblique purposes and sinister motives”, besides in violation of the Rule 7 of the Indian Police Service (Cadre) Rules, 1954 which lays down that every officer shall hold the post for at least two years.The petition further said: “The transfer of the petitioner in the aforesaid circumstances is for reasons smeared with malice, when there is no iota of material or evidence – far from proof – found or even imputed against the petitioner, and is solely based on conjectures, surmises and pure speculation, without detail of any sort against the petitioner having been noticed by anybody. .”Singh said he was constrained to write a letter to the chief minister on March 20 regarding Deshmukh’s conduct after his transfer owing to adverse media publicity by Deshmukh, in violation of his right to reputation, dignity, equality and liberty.In his letter which came out in the public domain a day ago, Singh made a spate of accusations against Deshmukh, who refuted the allegations.On Monday, NCP chief Sharad Pawar also rejected Singh’s claim, saying Deshmukh was in the hospital from February 5-15 and later in home quarantine till February 27 – the period when Param Bir Singh claimed Vaze had met the home minister.Meanwhile, Singh on Monday took charge as the Director General (DG) of Maharashtra Home Guard, a police official said.Singh reached the Home Guard office in south Mumbai around noon but avoided speaking to media persons, the PTI reported.The Maharashtra government transferred Singh from the post and appointed senior IPS officer Hemant Nagrale, who was holding additional charge of Maharashtra DGP, as the new commissioner of Mumbai Police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/param-bir-singh-moves-supreme-court-for-cbi-probe-against-anil-deshmukh-101616467693324.html

23-03-2021||India||Mercury drops as parts of city get light rain; showers likely today too: IMD||Parts of Delhi received trace rainfall on Monday, with strong winds and cloudy skies during the day, bring the Capital some respite from rising mercury levels that have consistently been above normal levels this month. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) said that with more clouds passing over the city, there is a possibility of light rains continuing on Tuesday.“More clouds are moving over the region. Though Delhi is not expected to receive any intense rainfall, it will be largely cloudy with light rains in some parts,” a senior Met official said on Monday.The overcast skies brought some respite from the rising heat in the city. The maximum temperature recorded at the Safdarjung weather station, which is considered the official marker for the city, was 33.6 degrees Celsius, down from 35.2°C in the previous day.However, Delhi on Monday also recorded the highest minimum temperature for the season, with the mercury levels touching 20°C.Scientists explained that temperatures usually tend to rise during the onset of a western disturbance, as in the early hours on Monday from when the minimum temperature recordings are noted.A western disturbance is an extra-tropical storm that originates in the Mediterranean, which brings with it rain and a drop in temperature and is mostly associated with winter rain in India.

23-03-2021||India||Contentious bill on Delhi clears Lok Sabha after heated debate||The Lok Sabha on Monday passed the The Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi (Amendment) Bill, 2021, that seeks to make it mandatory for the Delhi government to seek the prior opinion of the L-G before any executive action, following a heated debate which saw the Opposition parties rallying behind the AAP and accusing the Centre of trying to run Delhi through an administrator.Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal said by passing the Bill, the BJP has cheated the people and termed it an insult to the people of Delhi. “Passage of GNCTD Amendment Bill in Lok Sabha today is an insult to people of Delhi. The Bill effectively takes away powers from those who were voted by people & gives powers to run Delhi to those who were defeated. BJP has cheated the people,” Kejriwal tweeted.Senior Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader Gopal Rai said the Bill was an insult not only to the people of Delhi but also the Constitution.“It will be remembered as a black day in the history of democracy,” he tweeted.During the debate, the treasury bench argued that according to the laws, the Delhi government can only enjoy “crippled power”.Both sides sparred over legal arguments, power of Delhi’s L-G, the Balakrishna Committee report and even debated the performance of the Arvind Kejriwal government.The Bill, introduced in the House last Monday, says that “government” in Delhi will mean the L-G in the context of all legislation. It also says that the Delhi assembly cannot constitute any committees to look into the day-to-day and administrative issues.Since Delhi is a Union territory, its elected government does not have full control over the city-state. Law and order, land and services come directly under the L-G. This unique duality has led to frequent tussles between the Delhi government and the Centre.Congress leader Manish Tewari accused the BJP of turning 180 degrees in their stand on Delhi and pointed out that LK Advani as union home minister introduced 102nd constitutional amendment to give entire Delhi apart from New Delhi region full statehood. “The same NDA government brought a bill to end the democratic system in Delhi. This bill is unconstitutional and has a targeted and mala fide intention that seeks to take away Delhi’s character,” he said.He argued that the proposed law defies pragmatic federalism and violates the laxman rekha formed by Supreme Court for the Delhi government. “How can the Delhi government mean the LG when SC has said LG is only an administrator? You (the Centre) want to end democracy and run Delhi through LG,” Tewari accused.“If an assembly can’t have oversight of government activities, what is the utility of having an assembly?” asked Tewari.Tewari and New Delhi MP Meenakshi Lekhi argued over Article 239 AA and 239 B that defines the power for the L-G and the Delhi government. Lekhi said a governor works as per the advice of a council of ministers but an L-G is assisted by the council of ministers. “The rights of the state government and L-G haven’t been changed. They have been defined,” she said.Lekhi narrated several instances — water logging under Minto Bridge, non-availability of piped water in Patel Nagar, and how Delhi Police were denied buses to tackle farm law protesters—to label the AAP government as “anarchists”.She alleged that Kejriwal government spent ₹524 crore on advertisements while the former Delhi CM Sheila Dikshit had just ₹32 crore budget for publicity. “Union home minister sets up new hospitals which were to be done by Delhi CM. PM Awas scheme, Kisan samman nidhi are not given to people in Delhi,” she said, accusing the government of mismanaging the national capital.AAP MP from Sangrur (Punjab) Bhagwant Mann slammed the Centre as “specialist in snatching power of states”. He gave examples of Madhya Pradesh and quipped, “Where the BJP doesn’t come to power through elections it comes through by-elections”.He said the Delhi CM, a “Magsaysay award winner”,sought votes on his performance and asked if the BJP can do the same. “What is the problem in sitting in Opposition? You didn’t give Leader of Opposition to Congress in Lok Sabha but we gave your leader [the status of] LoP in Delhi assembly. We didn’t hand over a stadium to you because you wanted to make it a prison for farmers. Tomorrow, you might bring a Bill for no elections in the country.”Shiv Sena MP Vinayak Raut argued that “just as Lok Sabha is supreme, an assembly is supreme in its own state” and said, “Are we going towards the British Raj? We are imposing a bureaucrat on top of people’s representatives. This Bill would mean the assembly or a minister can’t take any steps.”BSP’s Danish Ali was critical of the AAP government but attacked the BJP saying, “It’s very unfortunate that this NDA government tramples upon BR Ambedkar’s constitution. Instead of decentralisation of power, it is being given to a person.”While the YSR Congress Party supported the Bill, the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) opposed it.The Bill will now be taken up in the Rajya Sabha for consideration, before it becomes the law.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/contentious-bill-clears-lok-sabha-after-heated-debate-101616465859412.html

The woman said she got tested at the hospital on Monday afternoon after she started sweating and experiencing severe body aches.Experts said fully vaccinated people getting infected is not surprising, particularly since now vaccine is 100% effective. But a coronavirus vaccine is still expected to offer 100% protection against severe illness.“Around 12.50pm Monday, I started getting severe body aches and also started sweating profusely. So, I got tested at the hospital itself and found out that I have the infection,” said Wadhwa.“Efficacy of none of the vaccines, whether for Covid-19 or for other infections such as the flu is 100%,” said Dr GC Khilnani, former head of the department of pulmonology, the All India Institute of Medical Sciences.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nurse-tests-positive-for-covid-over-a-month-after-getting-both-vaccine-doses-101616465671235.html
23-03-2021||India||Ease of purchase: Better experience for buyers ahead in Delhi's liquor policy||Letting private sector handle alcohol retail, requiring shops to mandatorily allow customers to enter for purchases, and opening doors for new “super-premium” liquor vends for high value products are expected to significantly improve the experience for consumers, experts and citizens on Monday said, listing problems in the way sales happen in most parts of the Capital at present.The Delhi government announced details of an overhaul of its liquor policy, which was approved by the chief minister. The new rules will now be drafted and sent to Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal.Also read | Liquor policy: Govt divides Delhi into 32 ‘zones’ to streamline excise earnings“The current retail experience is like a jail. When you go to a shop, there is a grille and people rush and throw money to buy liquor. There is no dignity. It will no longer be like that,” deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia said at a press briefing.Among the main measures to improve the buying experience is a rule that will need any liquor vend in the city to be at least 500 square feet in size. “There can be no counters facing towards the road. They will have to ensure that liquor sale and pick up takes place properly inside the shop premises. The shop owners will have to ensure law and order outside the shop,” Sisodia said.The government also decided that it will exit the retail sale business, and allow private companies to step in. “We have detected revenue leakages in the government shops -- through tax evasion, brand pushing and other means. Also, most government shops operate with 150 sq ft space. Several of them have grilled counters,” said Sisodia.The proposed policy includes a new license category to enhance the liquor-buying experience for those looking for high-end products. The government wants these to be at least 5,000 sq ft in area, and deal in sales of premium brands only. The plan allows these to be open for an hour longer than the usual closing time.Also read: Microbreweries likely to be allowed take-away and supply to barsConsumers said the proposed policy could improve customer experience.“The new policy sounds good. For women, most government shops are no-go zones. They are very crowded and women do not feel safe. Then there is this taboo about women buying liquor. That is one reason why most of my women friends prefer going to private outlets,” said Akanksha Nagpal, manager at an audit firm based in Delhi.Arijit Sen, who works with a legal consultancy company, said the biggest concern with government retail shops has been the lack of room to explore brands, “In peak hours, one has to have a certain brand in mind. Sometimes, shop owners push another brand as an alternative. The range of stock too is a major issue. These problems are likely to get resolved with private players taking over,” he said.Industry representatives welcomed the move, but said the implementation needs to be carefully done and the policy studied further.“If the government has decided to exit the retail sector, it must do so in a carefully calibrated and phased manner — their exit from the retail sector at one go can potentially give disproportionate power to private license holders, lead to cartelisation with undue control on brand availability — thus disrupting the organic demand-supply mechanism. That will lead to customers facing the same old problems,” said Vinod Giri, director-general of the Confederation of Indian Alcoholic Beverage Companies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ease-of-purchase-better-experience-for-buyers-ahead-in-delhi-s-liquor-policy-101616465192295.html
23-03-2021||India||Man held for floating ponzi scheme, duping over 500 of ₹8 lakh in Delhi||Delhi Police on Monday claimed to have arrested a 45-year-old man for allegedly running a ponzi scheme and cheating more than 500 people on the pretext of providing them rations for a period of 15 months. Senior police officers said the suspected con man collected ₹1,500 from each person to fraudulently enrol them as a member of an NGO named “Target Welfare Association” to avail of rations and later fled with the money. Till date, over 500 people have been duped of more than ₹8 lakh cumulatively, police said.Police have identified the arrested man as Rajesh Kumar Bhartiya. Senior police officers said the forgery came to light when multiple complaints were received against the “NGO Target Welfare Association” that despite paying ₹1,500 and enrolling for free distribution of ration -- flour, rice, sugar, and refined oil etc -- for 15 months, the NGO did not give any ration.Deputy commissioner of police (economic offences wing) Mohammad Ali said preliminary probe revealed that the NGO is run by one Rajesh Kumar Bhartiya and his associates. “It was also found that the same NGO was running similar schemes in the areas of Jhandewalan, Pratap Nagar, Manakpura, Kishanganj, Mukundpur, Dabri etc. Complainants further alleged that the NGO is neither supplying the ration nor answering the phone since the membership amount was paid. A case of cheating was registered, and investigation was taken up,” Ali said.The DCP said during investigation, it was established that Bhartiya is the key accused who is running the ponzi scheme and he is also the beneficiary of the money duped from people. “When our teams tried to contact him, he never joined the investigation and frequently changed his address. With the help of technical surveillance, our teams managed to zero in on him in Nangloi and he was arrested on Friday following a search,” the officer said.During questioning, police found that Bhartiya and his associates have cheated at least 535 persons so far by enrolling them in their NGO. “They initially used to distribute some ration but later would flee with the membership amount and change their contact details,” a police office said, adding that efforts were on to arrest the remaining suspects.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/man-held-for-floating-ponzi-scheme-duping-over-500-of-8-lakh-in-delhi-101616455179666.html

In the scheme, people will get a thali (food plate) at a subsidised rate of ₹15. The idea was proposed in SDMC’s final budget presentation in February this year.The SDMC had in 2018-19 implemented the step on a pilot basis by opening five kiosks but the project was put on hold after the coronavirus pandemic struck the country.Senior SDMC officials said nearly 40 kiosks will be established at different places in south Delhi.The outlets will prominently cater to the lower-income groups as due to financial constraints, they mostly partake of unhygienic food, risking their health.“Initially, 10 kiosks with inbuilt kitchen mobile vans (IKMV) will be placed in each of the four zones and later, their number will increased or decreased, depending upon the requirement (in each zone). SDMC will provide bare spaces of 5X3 metres on a “as in wherein basis“ to the bidder who will be allowed to construct eco-friendly kiosks with no permanent structure. The bidder will bid considering the revenue potential and SDMC will not be responsible for losses,” stated the proposal which was approved by the standing committee. It will now be placed before the house meeting for a final nod.A senior SDMC official said the outlets will sell breakfast from 8am to 11am and lunch from noon to 3pm. “The maximum rate for breakfast would be ₹10 and lunch would ₹15. The menu will include puri and stuffed paratha in breakfast and rice, dal, raita, and roti in lunch,” said the official.The proposal also mentioned that a bidder can apply for a maximum of five sites at a time.Officials said chairs or temporary structures, which may hinder the movement of pedestrians, will not be allowed at these kiosks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sdmc-clears-plan-to-provide-a-plateful-of-food-for-15-40-kiosks-to-be-set-up-101616455190742.html
23-03-2021||India||Liquor policy: Govt divides Delhi into 32 ‘zones’ to streamline excise earnings||The Delhi government has made some structural changes to the state’s excise policy to augment its liquor revenue, including dividing the city into 32 zones and ensuring allotment of licenses on a zonal basis. The proposed policy, unveiled on Monday, also aims to recover projected revenues mostly through rationalisation of licenses as well as reducing duties and tax imposed on each bottle to “nominal rates”, apart from tightening protocols for issuing license to wholesale distributors, according to a document that HT has seen.Delhi currently earns ₹6,574 crore each year through excise revenue. Through the proposed policy, the government plans to increase its annual revenue by ₹1,500-2,000 crore, Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia said in a press briefing on Monday.Delhi currently has 849 liquor shops. These, however, are not equally distributed, which Sisodia said has proved to be an obstacle to the revenue Delhi earns through liquor trade.He said. “There are some areas of Delhi where liquor is overserved and there are some areas of Delhi where liquor is underserved or unserved. This is the fundamental reason why in Delhi liquor mafias work. You all know that Delhi has 272 wards. Of these, 79 wards have zero liquor shops. Around 45 wards have just one shop.”“Around 58% of Delhi is either unserved or underserved. Based on liquor sale distribution only 8% area of Delhi is normally served. There are around 37 wards where more than three liquor shops are present. On the other hand, there are 54 wards in Delhi where liquor is over-served some of these wards have more than 10 shops. This means in 20% of Delhi liquor is over-served. It is also to be noted that 50% of liquor shops in Delhi are present in just 45 wards. This clearly shows that in Delhi the liquor sale distribution is very unequal. The maximum revenue is coming from 189 liquor shops of just 46 wards. This also shows that from other areas misappropriation of revenue is taking place,” said Sisodia.The government plans to keep the total number of vends intact, reshuffling them to ensure a more equitable distribution across 272 municipal wards in the city, the New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) area and the Airport, which has been classified as a ‘special zone’.“Delhi will be distributed into pre-defined zones. Each zone will have an equal number of A category, B Category and C Category wards. A category would be the wards where the vends have the history & potential for higher sale, B category would be wards with history & potential for medium-level sale and C category would be wards which have history & potential of low sales. This method of zoning will ensure that each zone operator will have a fair and equal chance of generating optimum revenue,” read the recommendations by a Group of Ministers (GoM) in the document concerning the excise policy.Under the proposed policy, Delhi is supposed to be divided into 30 zones with 27 retail liquor shops in each. Other than that, the NDMC area will be one zone with 29 shops and the airport will be another zone with 10 retail shops.It also recommended that wholesale licenses should only be to experienced distributors who cannot be into manufacturing of liquor and in retail trade. The government in its report cited that manufacturers and retailers doubling up as distributors or using proxies in distribution leads to lapse in duty collection that arise on trade of liquor in each level – starting from a distillery to a household or a bar.The proposed policy also stresses on rationalising licenses. It has either merged or discontinued several licenses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/liquor-policy-govt-divides-delhi-into-32-zones-to-streamline-excise-earnings-101616455231720.html
23-03-2021||India||Microbreweries likely to be allowed take-away and supply to bars||New Delhi: The proposed excise policy for Delhi allows microbreweries in the city to offer take-away services for draught beer, and supply to bars and restaurants by meeting certain protocols.“Draught beer will be allowed to be taken away in bottles or growlers (pitcher or can like containers used for measuring beer) as applicable in other states such as Punjab and Karnataka. This will help fuel the micro-brewery industry. Draught beer will also be allowed to be served at permitted events who have the P10, P10A P11, P13 license. However, wherever draught beer is being served as a take away, clear signage and information will be needed to put up about its short shelf life and the bottles will have to mention the expiry date clearly,” read the report of group of ministers set up last September.The recommendations were cleared by the Delhi cabinet. Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia said on Monday that the excise department will start drafting the new Delhi Excise Policy, 2021 on the basis of the GoM report.The report also recommended that micro-breweries will be allowed to supply to other bars and restaurants who have L12, L15, L16, L17, L18, L19, L20, L21 licences. It said the orders can only be placed by the these licence holders through a retail vend who will procure the product from an L1 distributor. “Each microbrewery will have to appoint a L1 (wholesale license category) distributor for any off-premise sale. The L1 distributor and the micro-brewery will have the responsibility to reinforce the expiry date and ensure no product outside the expiry date is being sold at the outlets,” the report read.Delhi has only two microbreweries – Ministry of Beer and Connaught Club -- both located in Connaught Place, said a senior official in the excise department.Manpreet Singh, treasurer of the National Restaurants Association of India, said the proposed move will help in the growth of microbreweries in Delhi, and the owners expand their business. “The move to allow microbreweries use their additional capacity for distribution will be a major relief in the winter months when their capacities usually remain under-utilised because of drop in demand but they still have to pay a flat monthly fee.”In 2015, the Delhi government had introduced a provision in its excise policy to allow restaurants, hotels and clubs to have microbreweries. The first application for licence was received the same year. To be sure, the microbreweries in Gurugram had already existed for several years by then – expanding their range products and splashing big offers. But Delhi had a difficult road ahead.The Delhi Development Authority (DDA) in the Master Plan 2021 included microbreweries under the category of “liquor-making plants” that are prohibited in the Capital. In September 2018, lieutenant governor (L-G) Anil Baijal approved a proposal, which said microbreweries be excluded from the prohibited list. Matters related to land use in the Capital comes under the domain of the L-G.In February 2019, the DDA notified the change. Since then, two microbreweries have been functional in Delhi. According to current rules, a microbrewery can only have a capacity of up to 500 litres per day and has to install an on-site waste treatment plant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/microbreweries-likely-to-be-allowed-take-away-and-supply-to-bars-101616455237710.html
23-03-2021||India||Delhi riots: CCTV cams of police station not working when man assaulted, forced to sing national anthem, was ‘detained’||The Delhi Police on Monday told the Delhi high court that the CCTV cameras at the Jyoti Nagar police station, where a man was detained after being allegedly beaten up by police officers and forced to sing the national anthem in an injured condition during the north-east Delhi riots last year, were not working due to a “technical fault”.In an affidavit filed before justice Yogesh Khanna, through advocate Amit Mahajan, the city police said the CCTV cameras were not working owing to technical reasons and no tampering was noticed by the technician who had come to repair them.The police’s response comes on a plea by Kismatun, mother of Faizan, who had sought an SIT probe into her son’s death, who along with four other Muslim men, was seen in the video allegedly being assaulted by police officers and forced to sing the national anthem on February 24, 2020.According to the plea by Faizan’s mother, through advocate Soutik Banerjee, the police had illegally detained her son and denied him critical health care as a result of which he succumbed to injuries on February 26. She said her son was mercilessly beaten by the police on February 24 which is evident from the video of the alleged incident that had gone viral back then.On the last date, the court had asked the police to file an affidavit with info about CCTV cameras functioning in the relevant month along with relevant documents. It also asked the police to file an affidavit about preservation of relevant documents.In response, the police affidavit stated that apart from the service report about the repair of cameras, a report has also been obtained from the office of station house officer, Jyoti Nagar police station, north-east district, confirming that on the date and time of the incident, the CCTV Cameras on the premises of the police station were not functional -- the issue was got rectified only on March 4, 2020.Earlier, the police had told the court that it had pinpointed a probable police officer who could have shot a viral video wherein police officers were seen assaulting the youth and forcing him to sing the national anthem in his injured state.The police had also said they have not been able to identify the police officers in the video footage as they were wearing helmets and did not have name plates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-riots-police-station-cctv-cams-were-not-working-where-man-was-detained-101616455224688.html
23-03-2021||India||Not enough checks at Kumbh mela as concerns of Covid-19 spread mount||A day after the Union health secretary wrote to the state chief secretary raising concerns over “inadequate” preparations to handle Covid-19 spread in Haridwar Mahakumbh amid the rising number of Covid-19 cases across the country, the Haridwar district administration and mela authorities have stepped up the preparations for the same. The administration continues to face challenges given the pilgrim numbers that will turn up during the world’s largest religious congregation.The health department has decided to increase the number of tests during Mahakumbh mela which is scheduled to start from April 1 and go on till April 30. A government order on the same is yet to come. It has also decided to especially focus on the devotees coming from states, including Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Punjab, Madhya Pradesh, Delhi, Gujarat, Karnataka, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, where the cases have significantly increased in the past few days. Many experts are terming it the “second wave” of Covid-19 spread.Chief medical officer, Haridwar, Dr SK Jha said that following the Centre’s instructions to ramp up Covid-19 precautions, the district health department has decided to increase the number of tests in the mela area by roping in private pathology companies also.“To ensure maximum random testing of pilgrims during the peak of Mahakumbh, especially during the Shahi Snans, we would increase the tests by about four times. We have also tied up with seven private pathology companies to conduct the Covid-19 tests,” said Dr Jha.He said that the administration has built a 1,500-bed Covid-19 facility for the purpose of isolating those devotees who test positive for the virus.“Apart from this, six temporary hospitals are also being built in the entire Mahakumbh area. Also, ashrams and medical colleges in Haridwar would also be utilised to ensure adequate beds for Covid-19 isolation during the fair which is expected to witness millions of devotees, especially during the Shahi Snans,” said Dr Jha.Chief minister Tirath Singh Rawat had earlier eased out the Covid-19 restrictions in the Mahakumbh, including ending the mandatory Covid-19 RT-PCR negative test report, saying that, “the mega-event is held after every 12 years, hence devotees cannot be stopped from coming.” He had also promised to run extra buses to ferry devotees from neighbouring states to Haridwar apart from requesting railways to run extra trains during Shahi Snans during the Mahakumbh.His move was questioned by many experts apart from previous CM Trivendra Singh Rawat who had said that “lifting of restrictions would be highly risky for the state considering the rising number of cases in the country.” Later, on Saturday, during his visit to Haridwar, the chief minister had said that “the faith of devotees will overcome the fear of Covid-19” after which he tested positive for the virus on Monday.As part of precaution, the authorities would also conduct random sampling of people coming from public transport and private vehicles.“If any person is tested positive for the virus in public transport then he would be isolated in the Covid care centres as per the norms. However, if any person coming by his private vehicle tests positive, he would be turned back,” said Mahakumbh nodal health officer Dr AS Sengar. The official said that apart from trained doctors and nurses, medical students would also be deployed in the health facilities during Mahakumbh.He also stressed the strict adherence to Covid-19 precautions by those attending the mega-event.“To ensure compliance with the Centre’s guidelines, mela administration has started making relevant arrangements. Masks will be mandatory for all pilgrims which will be provided to them free of cost. Installing sanitiser dispensers, regular sanitization of Ganga ghats and water tap-soap facility for washing of hands is also being ensured by the mela administration,” he said.He also informed that during the first Shahi Snaan of Mahakumbh on March 11, around twenty teams of health department were formed for random checking of RT-PCR negative reports of pilgrims and tourists staying in hotels, lodges, ashrams, dharamshalas and guest houses.Amid the recent spike in Covid-19 positive cases, the administration on Monday held a meeting with dharamshala, hotels, tour-travel association, and traders to take adequate preventive measures regarding Covid-19.“From now onwards, the authorities would be checking hotels, lodges and dharamshalasas daily to ensure that they are adhering to the Covid guidelines,” said additional mela officer Ramji Sharan Sharma.Apart from the health administration, the police have also geared up to implement the Covid-19 precautions during Mahakumbh.Circle officer Kumbh traffic, Prakash Deoli, said, “Owing to a large number of pilgrims coming from buses and private vehicles, we have already enhanced the infrastructure at border check posts along with a ready to implement route diversion plan in case of pilgrim influx increasing during Mahakumbh.”He added, “The entry points to Haridwar from Narsain, Mandavar, Kali Nadi, Chidiyapur, Chila canal and Raiwala will be manned by state police and paramilitary forces personnel to ensure that the Covid-19 guidelines are followed by all.”The experts are, however, sceptical with the administration’s claims regarding the Covid-19 precautions, especially on the number of tests being done by it on a daily basis in Haridwar.Social activist Anoop Nautiyal, who had been keeping an eye on the pandemic situation in the state since the lockdown, said, “As far as the letter by the Union health secretary to state chief secretary is concerned, it suggests that the state has informed him that the government is conducting about 55,000 Covid-19 tests daily, something that is hard to believe.”“As per the daily health bulletin issued by the state health department, from March 1-21, a total of about 1 lakh tests have been conducted with about 5,000 tests every day, which is much less than what is claimed by the state before the Centre. With the number of cases rising again, the state should ensure foolproof facilities to handle the spread else it could prove very deadly for us considering the limited resources we have,” said Nautiyal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/not-enough-checks-at-kumbh-mela-as-concerns-of-covid-19-spread-mount-101616453809545.html
23-03-2021||India||Holes in NCP defence as Sharad Pawar backs Anil Deshmukh||Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar continued to defend his party colleague and Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh on Monday, claiming that at the time Deshmukh met police officer Sachin Vaze in February according to former Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh’s tell-all letter to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, the minister was at a Nagpur hospital being treated for Covid-19.This is the second day in a row Pawar has defended Deshmukh, who has been named by Singh as having asked Vaze to collect ₹100 crore a month from restaurants, hotels, and other sources.The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was quick to point out that Deshmukh addressed a press conference and also met with a Congress delegation on February 15 and February 8 respectively, and that video and photographic proof of these meetings were posted on Twitter by Deshmukh himself, putting a cloud over Pawar’s defence. This was also raised by some journalists at the NCP chief’s media briefing.The minister subsequently said that he met with the delegation virtually, and that he addressed the conference after his discharge and before going into home quarantine. But the BJP also pointed out that the police officer’s letter mentions the timing of the meeting as February end.The debate over Deshmukh’s whereabouts in February played out even as Singh followed up his letter with a plea in the Supreme Court, seeking an investigation by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) into the charges he has levelled against the minister. Singh was transferred on March 17 for his handling of the Antilia-Vaze-Hiran case, but said in his plea that the transfer was “arbitrary” and “illegal”.Singh did not respond to repeated calls and messages.Chief minister Thackeray has not responded to Singh’s letter so far, although his party, the Shiv Sena, has supported the home minister thus far.In the press briefing, Pawar showed a certificate issued by Alexis multi-specialty Hospital, Nagpur, where Deshmukh was admitted for Covid-19 treatment between February 5 and 15. After being discharged, Deshmukh was home quarantined till February 27, following medical advice, he added.“In view of fresh evidence... it would not be fair to take Anil Deshmukh’s resignation… The BJP’s demand for home minister’s resignation has no substance… I am absolutely clear that allegations made against Deshmukh are incorrect as he was in Nagpur,” the NCP chief said.He also claimed the allegations against Deshmukh are aimed at diverting investigations in the Antilia bomb scare case, in which gelatin sticks were planted in a car parked near billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s residence in south Mumbai.“There are some names which need to be investigated, which certain people may not like and thus, allegations were made against the home minister.”The BJP alleged that Pawar is misleading the public.“Shri Sharad Pawar ji said, from 15th to 27th February HM Anil Deshmukh was in home quarantine. But actually along with security guards & media, he was seen taking press conference!,” Fadnavis tweeted.Responding to Fadnavis, home minister Deshmukh said in a video statement that he met the media before leaving the hospital. He added that he was “home quarantined till February 27. I stepped out of my home on February 28”.BJP IT cell’s Amit Malviya also tweeted, “On 8th February, a delegation of the Congress party met Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh, claiming that influential voices tweeted against anti-India voices, under pressure from the BJP. Where did the delegation meet Anil Deshmukh? In the hospital?”Reacting on the claims, state Congress spokesperson Sachin Sawant said the meeting was held online. “I had two online meetings with @AnilDeshmukhNCP one on 8th Feb with a demand to inquire into the tweets of celebrities and another on 24th February to demand investigation into the Delkar suicide case because HM was infected with Covid and was hospitalized and then quarantined.”Pawar earlier suggested a probe by a former senior police officer and suggested former Mumbai Police chief Julio Ribeiro who demurred saying he did not want to get involved in a probe at his age (91) nor wants to “touch such a murky situation”.In his letter, Param Bir Singh accused Deshmukh of asking Vaze to “accumulate ₹100 crore per month” from bars, restaurants, and other establishments. Deshmukh has denied all the allegations. The National Investigation Agency has arrested Vaze in relation with that case.The Maharashtra Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) has named Vaze the prime accused in the murder of Mansukh Hiran, the Thane auto spare parts dealer who was linked to the vehicle in which the explosives were found. Hiran filed a complaint about the car being stolen on February 18. The explosives were found on February 25. Hiran was found dead in a creek on March 5. The ATS arrested two people, Vinayak Shinde and Naresh Gore, in connection with the crime on March 21.Param Bir Singh, who was transferred from his post to Commandant General of Home Guards, Maharashtra, on March 17, made the charges in a letter on March 20, a few days after Deshmukh told reporters that the transfer was not routine but due to “serious and unpardonable mistakes” committed by police officers in the Antilia security scare investigation.The Congress’s senior leaders and state ministers Ashok Chavan and Balasaheb Thorat met Thackeray to discuss the matter on Monday. After the meeting, Thorat said the CM will take a decision and that the home minister’s resignation will not happen just because the Opposition demanded it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/holes-in-ncp-defence-as-sharad-pawar-backs-anil-deshmukh-101616449096169.html
23-03-2021||India||Delhi reduces age bar in major liquor reform||The Delhi government on Monday announced it will slash the legal age of drinking in the Capital from 25 to 21, exit the retail alcohol business, and overhaul a labyrinthine tax system as part of a sweeping new policy meant to boost the city’s revenue, crack down on the liquor mafia, and improve user experience.Deputy CM Manish Sisodia said no additional liquor shops will be opened and that the government — which runs roughly two-thirds of the city’s 849 vends — will redistribute its stores to the private sector.The new policy will abolish the levying of taxes on each bottle, focusing instead on generating revenue upfront from the auction of store licences. It will introduce age gating, or checking of age proof at establishments.The policy aims at providing a more equitable distribution of stores, scraps several antiquated laws regulating service in restaurants, and reduces the number of dry days from 21 to 3.The steps were cleared by the cabinet on the recommendation of a group of ministers. Sisodia said the excise department will start drafting the new Delhi Excise Policy, 2021, on the basis of the report, and the changes will be sent to the L-G.It could take about three months till the policy is notified, but the government said it expected backlash.“Excise reforms announced today will act as a major blow to liquor mafia in Delhi. The mafia will do everything to obstruct these reforms. AAP govt has ended mafia raj in many sectors like education, water, elect, health etc. We are committed to reforming this sector too,” tweeted chief minister Arvind Kejriwal.Queries sent to the L-G’s office with regard to the development remained unanswered at the time of going to the print.“In the policy, proxy ownership of manufacturers or wholesalers in the retail business and low-quality shops will be gone. There will be zero-tolerance to liquor shops creating disturbances in localities. Also, all government liquor shops will shut as it’s not the state’s job to sell liquor,” Sisodia told reporters.He said the excise revenue is projected to increase by ₹1,500-2000 crore annually because of the new policy. Currently, the government gets around ₹6,000 crore from this revenue stream that is important because, unlike full states, Delhi doesn’t have access to all sources of income.For decades, Delhi’s liquor business has been notoriously unwieldy, as reported in a five-part series by HT in February. A high drinking age, coupled with outdated regulation, a thriving liquor mafia, and poor oversight, robbed the government of precious revenue, made premium brands scarce, and soured the experience for customers, especially women. The HT series was mentioned in the GoM report.Sisodia admitted the shortcomings, and said the current retail experience at state-run liquor shops was like jail.“When you go to a shop, there is a grill and people rush and throw money to buy liquor. There is no dignity. Bootlegging and illicit liquor will stop in these areas,” he said.The GoM report notes that Delhi is among a handful of states that kept 25 as the legal age of drinking. “The GoM is of the view that the this should be brought in line with majority of states in India …Hence we recommend the age to be reduced and be brought in parity with these states and especially neighbouring cities like Noida, Ghaziabad etc,” read the report, which was reviewed by Hindustan Times.But the government also stressed on robust checking of age for any patrons. “This concept of age gating is practised internationally and the same should be set up in Delhi,” the report said.The GoM report suggests strict parameters or checks for retail liquor license in Delhi. All liquor vends will need a minimum area of 500 square feet to provide a walk-in experience. Delhi will also have five “super-premium” liquor vends that will be allowed to be open till 11pm, an hour beyond usual vends.“The retail shopping experience for an average customer in Delhi is very pathetic. The scene outside any government vend resembles a zone of mob craving for liquor. The customer has no choice to choose any product and large-scale brand pushing and extra charging happens rampantly. The customers are made to feel like criminals,” the report read. Brand pushing refers to a practice of suppressing certain brands and pushing others, often at the behest of colluding manufacturers and retailers.For the retail trade, the government will divide the Capital into 32 zones — including an airport and an NDMC zone — where the existing 849 vends will be redistributed equitably. It has proposed three categories of retail liquor vends – high sale (category A), medium sale (B), and low sale (C), with the same number of vends under each category. The airport zone will have 10 stores and NDMC 29.To end cartelisation and brand pushing, the draft policy prohibits alcohol manufacturers from opening liquor stores. In wholesale, the government intends to introduce L1 license that will be issued only to high-end professional companies with years of distribution experience comparable to global industry standards.“Many wholesalers are able to acquire retail licenses through proxy ownership in the existing system. This highly prevalent, though illegal, form of dual ownership facilitates and makes it possible to indulge in sale of non-duty paid liquor… No manufacturer to be given the new L1 wholesale license. Any manufacturer that wishes to sell its product in Delhi will have to choose one of the licensed L1 distributors,” the report stated.Anurag Katriar, president of the National Restaurant Association of India (NRAI), said the reforms will give a big boost to the food and beverages industry. “While we await the formal release of the detailed policy document, we are very hopeful that they will be very progressive and will significantly change the way Delhi looks at the business of bars,” he said.The Bharatiya Janata Party opposed the move. “The truth is that actually government liquor shops were a hurdle for private liquor mafia to sell cheap brands of other states in Delhi, and now the Kejriwal government has given them the freedom,” said Delhi unit spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-reduces-age-bar-in-major-liquor-reform-101616448593581.html
23-03-2021||India||Widen gap in Covishield jabs to 6-8 weeks: Centre||The second dose of Covishield can be given up to eight weeks after the first, the Union health ministry said in a statement on Monday, expanding the maximum interval between the two shots from six weeks after the practice appeared to yield a higher efficacy in preventing Covid-19.The decision is likely to also help cover more people during the current vaccination campaign as it will allow hospitals and clinics to give out more first doses to people instead of worrying about stocking adequate supplies for second doses for the time being.“In view of the emerging scientific evidence, the interval between two doses of a specific Covid-19 vaccine i.e. Covishield, has been revisited by National Technical Advisory Group on Immunization (NTAGI) and subsequently by National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for Covid-19 (NEGVAC) in its 20th meeting. During this meeting the recommendation has been revised to provide 2nd dose of Covishield at 4-8 weeks’ interval after the 1st dose, instead of earlier practiced interval of 4-6 weeks,” said the health ministry statement.The increased interval does not apply to Covaxin, the other coronavirus vaccine India uses.Covishield is the made-in-India version of the Oxford-AstraZeneca AZD1222 vaccine. The Co-WIN platform dashboard showed on Monday evening that it accounted for 92% of the 46 million doses given till 6.30pm across the country.India opened up its vaccination drive for the priority groups among the general public on March 1. As per the schedule decided at first, those who got Covishield would need to get their second doses by mid-April. Now, they can wait until the end of April to do so.Experts in the field said the move to increase the interval will benefit the programme in the long run. “It is possible (there will be better protection) based on immunogenicity and UK trial efficacy data. The US data indicates good protection with shorter intervals, so real world monitoring will show how much extending the gap matters,” said Dr Gagandeep Kang, one of India’s top vaccine experts.A recommendation to delay second doses of AZD1222 was first made by UK’s Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) in December, when the group of experts cited data and an urgency to speed up first shots while the country grappled with a serious wave of infections.On February 1, a group of experts led by those from University of Oxford disclosed new phase III trial data to The Lancet for peer review supporting the decision. The data showed that expanding the interval between the two doses of the vaccine to three months helped increase the efficacy rate to 82.4%, compared to 54.9% if the second dose was given less than six weeks after the first.Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan communicated the NTAGI and NEGVAC recommendation on Monday to the chief secretaries of all states and union territories. “Keeping the existing scientific evidence in view, it appears that protection is enhanced if the second dose of Covishield is administered between 6-8 weeks, but not later than stipulated period of 8 weeks,” the letter said.Bhushan also urged the states to instruct officials concerned accordingly, to undertake necessary steps to widely disseminate the message of revised dosing interval and ensure adherence to the revised dosing interval.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/widen-gap-in-covishield-jabs-to-6-8-weeks-centre-101616447853860.html

I am fine and not facing any difficulty. I have isolated myself under the monitoring of doctors. Those of you who have come into contact with me in last few days, should be cautious and get their tests done. I wish good health to all,” Rawat tweeted.He visited Haridwar three times after becoming CM on March 10, and mingled with pilgrims and ascetics, with hardly anyone following Covid safety norms. Rawat was not wearing a mask in several images taken of him in Haridwar on the day of the “shahi snan” (holy dip) on March 11, when the crowds swelled to 3.3 million.After Rawat took over as CM, he said that there should not be any restrictions on pilgrims wishing to come to Mahakumbh after April 1. Two days ago, during a visit to Haridwar, Rawat said: “Nobody will be stopped in the name of Covid-19, as we are sure the faith in God will overcome the fear of the virus.”Worried about the situation in Haridwar in the context of the Mahakumbh and Rawat’s statements, the Centre on Sunday wrote to the Uttarakhand government to take stringent measures to check Covid spread during the Kumbh.Haridwar has highest active cases of all 13 districts in the state at the moment.Since taking over as chief minister of the state on March 10, Rawat has courted several controversies.On Sunday, at a public function, he said that “the US had enslaved India for 200 years”, and questioned why people do not have 20 children if they wanted more subsidised rations during Covid.On March 16, Rawat objected to people, particularly women, wearing ripped jeans.“Ripped jeans paves the way for societal breakdown and is a bad example parents set for their children. Wearing ripped jeans is not our culture but aping westernisation,” he said.Rights activists and the opposition Congress slammed the CM over his comments.“Don’t know what has happened to the CM. Is it lack of wisdom or lack of education or is he doing it deliberately? First, he made a derogatory statement on the attire of women, and then he made a highly insulting statement on producing children”, Congress spokesperson Garima Dasauni said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/twist-of-faith-uttarakhand-cm-tirath-singh-rawat-tests-covid-positive-101616447083279.html
23-03-2021||India||UP, MP sign deal on linking of Ken and Betwa rivers; experts flag concerns||Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh on Monday signed a Memorandum of Agreement (MoA) for starting work on country’s first major project interlinking two rain-fed rivers, Ken and Betwa, in the presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, even as environmental activists said the project would spell doom for the Panna tiger reserve which is known for its critically endangered white-rumped vultures besides a thriving big cat population.The MoA was signed 18 years after the project was first conceived as a part of country’s ambitious programme to interlink rivers to provide water to areas facing scarcity. Officials said the delay was because of no agreement between the two states on sharing of water during the lean supply months, November to April.The Uttar Pradesh government, which was initially demanding 930 million cubic meter (MCM) water during the Rabi (winter crop) season, settled for 750 MCM while Madhya Pradesh will receive 1,834 MCM water, said an officer of the MP water resources department.According to the project report, 2,800 MCM of water will be diverted from the Ken basin to the water-deficit Betwa basin through a 73.8 meter high dam proposed on Ken at Daudhan in MP’s Chhattarpur district.The report also said 6,017 hectares forest land of Panna Tiger Reserve and the Ken Ghariyal Sanctuary would be submerged in the dam reservoir.MP chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan said people of nine Madhya Pradesh districts, Sagar, Chhatarpur, Vidisha, Shivpuri, Raisen, Damoh, Panna and Tikamgarh, and four districts of Uttra Pradesh, Mahoba, Jhansi, Lalitpur and Banda will benefit from the project.“About 1 million hectares of land will get irrigated and 6.2 million people, mostly in water deficit Bundelkhand region, will get drinking water,” he added.There is, however, opposition to the project from the Panna royal family and environmentalists. “It is very sad that the government and experts overlooked the possible impact of the project on diamond mining in Panna and wildlife in the area. We will lose our world famous diamond site for ever,” said Maharani Jiteshwari Judevi of Panna royal family.Judevi said, “According to a report of 1938 on Diamond mines, the production of diamond took place naturally in Panna and it being excavated since 15th century. The seepage of water due to the dam will reduce the temperature and also reduce the level of nitrogen which is important for the natural production of diamond. I am raising this issue and I want a scientific study should be done to check the impact of dam water on diamond mine.”Himanshu Thakkar, convenor of South Asia Network on Dams, River and People (SANDRP) said it was “very unfortunate” that the Central and state governments signed an MoA on World Water Day even though the project would proved to be a curse for water conservation.“According to a report of the forest advisory committee, an estimated 4.6 million trees will be cut down for the project. This will lead to poor rainfall in an already parched Bundelkhand,” he added.He said that the project will also destroy Panna Tiger Reserve, home to over 52 tigers and several species of endangered vultures, including the white-rumped vulture. Of the nine vulture species found in India, six can be seen in Panna, which has run a successful vulture population revival programme.Several committees, including the Supreme Court-appointed Central Empowered Committee (CEC), have raised doubts about the project. A petition opposing the approval to the project is pending before the Supreme Court.“We are sure the project won’t get forest clearance,” Thakkar said.Former environment minister Jairam Ramesh feared the project would destroy local ecology. “The CMs of UP and MP will sign a pact today to link the Ken and Betwa rivers. This will all but destroy the Panna Tiger Reserve in MP, a success story in translocation and revival. I had suggested alternatives 10 years ago but alas,” he tweeted earlier in the day.Meanwhile, the Prime Minister’s Office said the project will “also pave the way for more interlinking of river projects to ensure that scarcity of water does not become an inhibitor for development in the country.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/up-mp-sign-deal-on-linking-of-ken-and-betwa-rivers-experts-flag-concerns-101616446673949.html
23-03-2021||India||To increase cap on reservation, Karnataka to approach Supreme Court||The Karnataka government on Monday decided to inform the Supreme Court that it favours increasing the cap on reservation beyond the 50% ceiling that would pave the way for chief minister BS Yediyurappa-led Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to heed the growing demands from dominant and politically influential communities for reservation.“The decision to approach the SC was taken today,” said a cabinet minister of the Karnataka government, requesting not to be named.The cabinet decided to inform the apex court to increase the cap on reservation on employment and education on the back of growing number of calls from several communities, seeking an increase in opportunities.However, the state is yet to file an affidavit before the SC, according to a person aware of the developments.At least five other states --- Maharashtra, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu and Jharkhand --- in the country have decided to ask the highest court to increase reservation caps. The reservation in government jobs and education has been capped at 50% by the SC in a 1992 order by a nine-judge Constitution bench. However, the apex court allowed the relaxation of this cap provided there was enough scientific data to justify the raising of the cap.Dominant communities like the Panchamasali, a sub sect of Lingayats, Vokkaligas, Valmikis and Kurubas among others have sought a higher allocation of reservation-based opportunities and a change in category among other requests. Karnataka chief minister BS Yediyurappa, who has been under immense pressure to heed these requests, had set up a committee to study these requests.Yediyurappa, known for his reservation-based politics, has tried to assuage the demands of these dominant communities to earn their support in the 2023 assembly elections. A Lingayat himself, Yediyurappa has enjoyed the support of the community and has attempted to further consolidate the community’s support to fuel his ambition of bringing the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to power on its own in 2023. He has reached out to communities that are not known to back the BJP as well. The dominant Vokkaliga community, found in large numbers in the Old Mysuru region, are known to back former Prime Minister HD Deve Gowda and former chief minister HD Kumaraswamy-led Janata Dal (Secular) or JD(S) while backward classes, the Kurubas and minorities among others are seen to back the Congress.By heeding these requests for higher allocations and even change of category of reservation, Yediyurappa is attempting to expand the support base of the saffron party, analysts said.The Panchamasalis called off their agitation in Bengaluru after assurances by the chief minister while other communities have kept the heat on the chief minister.Yediyurappa is reported to have further strained his relations with the BJP’s top central leadership and has battled dissent within his government, the opposition and growing reservation demands to remain in power at least till the next elections.Yediyurappa has allocated ₹500 crore each to the Lingayats and Vokkaligas and another ₹50 crore for the Brahmin community in the state. He has also budgeted ₹1500 crore for minorities in the state budget.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/to-increase-cap-on-reservation-karnataka-to-approach-supreme-court-101616442832261.html
23-03-2021||India||Sachin Vaze stayed at 5-star hotel using forged Aadhaar card, fake name: NIA||The National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Monday conducted a search in a five star hotel in South Mumbai where suspended assistant police inspector Sachin Vaze, arrested for his alleged role in planting the explosive-laden Mahindra Scorpio found abandoned near billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s residence last month, was staying recently.NIA officials said that a team conducted a search in a room in the Trident hotel at Nariman Point where Vaze reportedly resided from February 16 to February 20. Vaze reportedly booked the hotel room with a forged Aadhar card using his photograph with fictitious name, said an NIA official.A senior official said that documents and CCTV footage have been recovered from the hotel.“The case is being investigated by NIA and anti–terrorism squad (ATS). The probe is ongoing and we are extending our fullest cooperation,” a spokesperson of the hotel said.Read more: Mansukh Hiran murder mystery solved, Sachin Vaze the prime accused, says Maharashtra ATSA Mumbai Police officer said that those dates coincided with the time when Vaze was part of a team that raided various establishments in Mumbai at night for violations of licence conditions such staying open at night beyond allowed hours, among other reasons.Vaze also reported for work at the crime intelligence unit of the Mumbai crime branch during those dates.The NIA team seized some documents from the hotel room, but it is not clear what the documents pertain to as yet. The team has also seized the CCTV footage from the hotel to probe who all met Vaze at the hotel.On March 13, Vaze, who was the lead investigator in the case, was arrested by NIA which took over the probe earlier this month. Vaze has also been named prime accused in the murder of Mansukh Hiran, a 48-year-old Thane businessman who was linked to the Scorpio.Read more: How Param Bir Singh-Deshmukh faceoff puts NCP chief Sharad Pawar in a tough spotAn NIA team visited Hiran’s home to record the statements of his wife Vimala and other family members.The Union home ministry had transferred the murder probe, currently being conducted by the Maharashtra ATS, to NIA on March 20. “The NIA had come home to explain us the status of their investigation and informed that they will take all the details from ATS in the coming days. As of now they haven’t officially filed any case in the murder of my brother. They told us that they will come to meet us in next two days with more information on the case. They have not shed light on the role of Shinde or the bookie to us. They stayed for a short time and left,” Hiran’s brother Vinod said.ATS had on Sunday arrested two persons in connection with Hiran’s murder: a former constable Vinayak Shinde and a bookie Naresh Gor. Shinde, convicted in an encounter killing, was released on parole last year during the decongestion of prisons due to the pandemic.Vinod claimed that Hiran’s family is satisfied with the pace of the investigation and hope it will be resolved soon.A Scorpio that Hiran had been driving for three years and reported stolen on February 18, was found parked outside Ambani’s residence Antilia on February 25. It had 20 sticks of gelatin (but no detonator or timer) and a threatening letter addressed to Ambani.Vimla’s statement to the ATS revealed that Vaze had borrowed this car from Hiran last year, and returned it to him on February 5.Read more: Hiran reported the car stolen on February 18. On February 25, the car was found parked outside Antilia with two identical sets of three different registration number plates kept beneath the rear seat of the vehicle, and its own engine number and body number of the vehicle removed. Even the chassis number embossed on the car near right front wheel was wiped out.The Gamdevi police registered an FIR in the case on multiple charges. On March 7, on the basis of a statement given by Vimala, ATS registered a murder case against an unknown person and started the probe. The next day, NIA took over the probe into the Gamdevi FIR after orders from the Union home ministry..Who is Shinde?In 2013, a Mumbai sessions court had awarded life sentences to 21 people, including 13 Mumbai Police personnel, for an encounter killing of a gangster named Lakkhan Bhaiyya (Ramnarayan Gupta) in 2006. Gupta was a member of the dreaded Chota Rajan gang.One of the policemen convicted was Vinayak Shinde, 55, a constable, who was released on parole last year in the state’s drive to decongest prisons during the coronavirus pandemic.Shinde is one of the co-accused, along with bookie Naresh Gore and prime suspect Sachin Vaze, a suspended assistant inspector currently in custody of the National Investigation Agency (NIA), in the murder of Thane businessman Mansukh Hiran.According to investigators of the state Anti Terrorism Squad, Shinde took care of Vaze’s “illegal dealings in Thane and Kalwa areas” and executed the murder of Hiran on Vaze’s behest.Shinde was in Mumbai Crime branch in the mid 2000s and had a good network in Mumbai as well as Thane. “Shinde has a good network across Thane and also has connections with local goons,” a police officer said on condition of anonymity.One of Shinde’s family members said that after he came out of parole, he would stay home. Shinde celebrated his birthday on March 11 with his family at his house.With inputs from Anamika Gharat||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sachin-vaze-stayed-at-5-star-hotel-using-forged-aadhaar-card-fake-name-nia-101616440213246.html
23-03-2021||India||SC notice to Centre on guidelines against runaway NRI grooms||Moved by the plight of women abandoned by runaway non-resident Indian (NRI) grooms in the country as well as abroad, the Supreme Court on Monday agreed to consider a fresh plea for issuing guidelines to police, immigration authorities and Indian embassies to ensure speedy justice to such victims.A three-judge bench comprising Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde, and Justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian directed the Centre to file its reply by July this year on the guidelines needed to protect the brides who are abandoned, abused or divorced by NRI grooms against whom neither any court proceedings are maintainable nor criminal proceedings can be initiated as their location is not known.The petition was filed in the year 2019 by NGO Pravasi Legal Cell along with two victims fighting a legal battle against their truant grooms settled abroad. The Court directed this petition to be taken up along with a pending petition filed by one Smita Kudaisya where the same issue is already under consideration.The petition by Pravasi Legal Cell filed through advocate Jose Abraham pointed out that in cases where NRI grooms abandon or dupe gullible women in India, police refuse to register a first information report against the husband due to the absence of his overseas address. Even courts cannot proceed with the case as service of summons or warrants to the husbands who are settled abroad becomes difficult.One of the co-petitioners married an NRI settled in Germany and faced severe brutality and harassment there for want of dowry. She managed to reach India and filed a domestic violence case. After much difficulty, she located the new address of her husband to serve him summons through the embassy.The other co-petitioner has not been so lucky. After being married to a Dubai-based NRI, the husband filed for divorce in a local Delhi court. When the wife moved a petition seeking maintenance, the husband fled the country and remains untraced to date. Further maintenance proceedings have been halted as notice cannot be served to the husband.The petition further stated that no help is forthcoming from embassies for Indian brides who are duped or abandoned by NRI grooms in foreign countries. “The embassies do not even bother to respond to the cries of distress of Indian citizens. When the women contact the police of the foreign country directly they are informed by the police that privacy laws do not permit the police to give away the location of their husbands,” the petition stated.The population of Indians settled overseas is quite significant. A report prepared by the United Nations recently pegs the population of the Indian diaspora across the world at 18 million.“Looking at this figure, it becomes imperative on part of the government to immediately frame necessary guideline to be followed by the police, the immigration department and embassies throughout the world for professional and speedy justice to be provided to the women abandoned by their husbands,” the petition added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-notice-to-centre-on-guidelines-against-runaway-nri-grooms-101616440198239.html
23-03-2021||India||UK ‘blames’ SII for delay vaccines priority in India as cases surge: Officials||Vaccine supplies to India have taken a priority as the country records a resurgence of Covid-19 cases, people aware of supply and sourcing have said, amid remarks from officials in the UK that appeared to blame delays in deliveries from Serum Institute of India for a shortfall in its estimated stock of doses.On Thursday, British health secretary Matt Hancock said a delayed delivery of AstraZeneca vaccines made by the Serum Institute, in addition to the need to retest them, would postpone its immunisation program. The same day, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the country would receive fewer vaccines than planned a week ago, in part because of a shortfall from the Serum Institute.“The company has already supplied 5 million doses to UK with the aim of assisting the country in their vaccination programme. There were 5 million more doses to be supplied but since the situation is changing on a day-to-day basis, and new cases rising in India over the past few weeks, the home country has taken priority,” said one of the people familiar with the developments.“Also, India is ramping up its vaccination drive that has also increased the demand for vaccine doses,” this person added.Officials in the Union health ministry refuted allegations that the government had stopped the company from exporting its Covid-19 vaccine doses.“The government has not issued any directions to Serum regarding not to export their Covid vaccine,” said a senior central government official, who asked not to be named.Serum Institute of India is locally manufacturing Oxford-AstraZeneca’s coronavirus vaccine— AZD1222— as the Covishield. It is one of two vaccines approved in India, and accounts for over 92% of the doses given till Monday.“Dear Countries & governments, as you wait Covishield supplies, I humbly request you to please be patient, serum institute of india has been directed to prioritise the huge needs of India and along with that balance the needs of the rest of the world. We are trying out best,” SII CEO Adar Poonawalla said in a tweet on February 21.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uk-blames-sii-for-delay-vaccines-priority-in-india-as-cases-surge-officials-101616438721246.html
23-03-2021||India||Row over Maharashtra minister rocks Parliament||Protests erupted in Parliament on Monday over the allegations of corruption by former Mumbai police chief Param Bir Singh against Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh, with Union minister Anurag Thakur demanding appropriate action against the state minister.The Rajya Sabha was adjourned amid protests and the Lok Sabha also saw sharp exchanges between Bharatiya Janata Party, Congress and Shiv Sena MPs. In the Lower House, BJP MP Manoj Kotak demanded a Central Bureau of Investigation probe into the matter.Speaking during the Question Hour in the Lok Sabha, Thakur said that the allegation that Deshmukh wanted police officers to collect ₹100 crore per month was a “matter of concern”.“The MPs not only from Maharashtra, but from all over India are concerned about the serious allegation of corruption (against Anil Deshmukh ) in Maharashtra... The state government should take appropriate action on the issue,” he said before many ruling party MPs raked up the issue during Zero Hour.Last week, former Mumbai Police commissioner Singh said that Deshmukh wanted police officers to collect ₹100 crore monthly from bars, restaurants and other establishments in Mumbai.In the Lok Sabha, BJP MP Rakesh Sinha emphasised that the allegations were raised by a former top cop and said: “The House wants to know why an API of Mumbai police was given a target of ₹100 crore? Perhaps this is the first such event in the country.”Sena MP Vinayak Raut alleged that the developments are a part of a larger conspiracy and the BJP is trying to topple the Maharashtra government. Congress MP Ravneet Singh Bittu termed the developments as a serious matter but questioned why principals of federalism were broken in all Opposition-ruled states, and central agencies were interfering.“The officers are always the main culprits. But they get away while we politicians fight against each other,” Bittu said. “We can fight against each other in assemblies, newspapers or Parliament. But any officers who are guilty should not get away.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/row-over-maharashtra-minister-rocks-parliament-101616438734191.html

There was no discussion on the current crisis and the class took place normally. Since it was made open for all students at the university, nearly 600 students attended the class using a digital platform along with hundreds who were already present on the campus,” said Biplob Kumar Das, 21, a final-year undergraduate student of Political Science at the varsity. The university’s students’ body – Ashoka University Student Government – said in total around 900 students attended the lecture.News of Mehta’s exit broke on Thursday (he resigned on March 15) and caused a stir among students, faculty, and the larger academic community in India and overseas. In his resignation he wrote that “after a meeting with Founders, it has become abundantly clear to me that my association with the University may be considered a political liability” on account of his “public writing”. On Friday, Subramanian, former chief economic advisor, resigned saying Mehta’s exit reflected poorly on the university’s ability to protect academic freedom.On Sunday, Mehta wrote to students asking them not to “press the matter” and the university’s chancellor Rudrangshu Mukherjee wrote in a letter to students and faculty that the founders “never interfered with academic freedom.”The board of trustees met the students’ body on Sunday, but the previously planned boycott wasn’t called off.Dozens of students were present at the university campus on Monday wearing black to register their dissent over the exits of Mehta and Subramanian . The boycott of classes is slated to continue till Tuesday.While students boycotted most of the classes on Monday, they said that some classes were held using non-university resources.A major demand of students has been to hold an open meeting with University founders. Despite repeated calls, messages, and e-mails, university officials refused to comment on the matter.The Board of Trustees, however, said on Monday that the founders “have never interfered with, nor do they intend to interfere, with academic functioning of the university.”“The founders are supportive with the appointment of the Ombudsperson (as had been decided earlier) by May 31 2021. The Chancellor and Vice-Chancellor will propose candidates for this position for approval by the Governing Body,” the statement read.The statement also called for strengthening existing protocols and processes like the Academic Council and Board of Management which separate academic functioning from Founders.University officials including Ashoka University chancellor Rudrangshu Mukherjee, vice-chancellor Malabika Sarkar, chairperson of Board of Trustees, Ashish Dhawan on Sunday assured students in a statement, also signed by Mehta and Subramanian that they would work to resolve the crisis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ashoka-university-students-begin-class-boycott-demand-changes-101616438765195.html

She said the district administration is conducting RT-PCR tests on all residents and will initiate testing in schools as well.A total of 1,445 new cases were reported from across Karnataka, taking the total active cases to 14,267.

23-03-2021||India||UK ‘blames’ SII for delay Vaccines priority in India as cases surge: Officials||Vaccine supplies to India have taken a priority as the country records a resurgence of Covid-19 cases, people aware of supply and sourcing have said, amid remarks from officials in the UK that appeared to blame delays in deliveries from Serum Institute of India for a shortfall in its estimated stock of doses.On Thursday, British health secretary Matt Hancock said a delayed delivery of AstraZeneca vaccines made by the Serum Institute, in addition to the need to retest them, would postpone its immunisation program. The same day, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the country would receive fewer vaccines than planned a week ago, in part because of a shortfall from the Serum Institute.“The company has already supplied 5 million doses to UK with the aim of assisting the country in their vaccination programme. There were 5 million more doses to be supplied but since the situation is changing on a day-to-day basis, and new cases rising in India over the past few weeks, the home country has taken priority,” said one of the people familiar with the developments.“Also, India is ramping up its vaccination drive that has also increased the demand for vaccine doses,” this person added.Officials in the Union health ministry refuted allegations that the government had stopped the company from exporting its Covid-19 vaccine doses.“The government has not issued any directions to Serum regarding not to export their Covid vaccine,” said a senior central government official, who asked not to be named.Serum Institute of India is locally manufacturing Oxford-AstraZeneca’s coronavirus vaccine— AZD1222— as the Covishield. It is one of two vaccines approved in India, and accounts for over 92% of the doses given till Monday. “Dear Countries & governments, as you wait Covishield supplies, I humbly request you to please be patient, serum institute of india has been directed to prioritise the huge needs of India and along with that balance the needs of the rest of the world. We are trying out best,” SII CEO Adar Poonawalla said in a tweet on February 21.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uk-blames-sii-for-delay-vaccines-priority-in-india-as-cases-surge-officials-101616438571137.html
23-03-2021||India||Gandhi Peace Prize for Mujibur Rahman, late Sultan of Oman||India on Monday announced the Gandhi Peace Prize for the years 2019 and 2020 will be conferred on late Omani Sultan Qaboos bin Said Al Said and Bangladeshi leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, respectively, for their contributions to social and political transformation through non-violent methods. Both Sultan Qaboos, who died last year, and Rahman were unanimously selected for the prize by a jury chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on March 19. The award carries an amount of ₹1 crore, a citation, a plaque and a traditional handicraft or handloom item. A special exception was made for the award to be conferred on the two leaders, as the selection procedure does not allow the Gandhi Peace Prize to be awarded posthumously, people familiar with the development said. However, given the contributions of Sultan Qaboos and Rahman to peace, non-violence and amelioration of human sufferings and their special relationship with India, an exception was made as a special gesture to honour and celebrate them, the people cited above said. The prize is given for social, economic and political transformation through non-violence and other Gandhian methods. The Gandhi Peace Prize recognises the “immense and unparalleled contribution” of Rahman in “inspiring the liberation of Bangladesh, bringing stability to a nation born out of strife, laying the foundation for the close and fraternal relations between India and Bangladesh, and promoting peace and non-violence in the Indian subcontinent”, an official statement said. The announcement came days ahead of Modi’s two-day visit to Dhaka from March to participate in celebrations marking the birth centenary of Rahman, the father of nation of Bangladesh, 50 years of the country’s independence and the golden jubilee of diplomatic relations between the two countries. According to the statement, Modi said “Bangabandhu”, as Rahman is popularly known, was a champion of human rights and freedom, and a hero to Indians as well. He added that Rahman’s legacy and inspiration has made the “heritage of both countries more comprehensive and deep-rooted”, and the path shown by him has “laid a strong foundation for the partnership, progress and prosperity of both countries over the last decade”. India is honoured to commemorate Rahman’s legacy jointly with the Bangladeshi government and people as the neighbouring country celebrates his birth centenary, the official statement said. The Gandhi Peace Prize for Sultan Qaboos recognises his “unparalleled vision and leadership” in strengthening India-Oman relations and his efforts to promote peace and non-violence in the Gulf, the statement read. Modi had recalled Sultan Qaboos’ contribution to India-Oman ties when he passed away in January last year, saying that he was “a true friend of India and provided strong leadership for developing a strategic partnership” between the two sides. Sultan Qaboos’ twin policy of moderation and mediation in addressing international issues won him praise and respect across the globe, the official statement said. He played an important role in supporting peace efforts in various regional disputes and conflicts. The sultan had studied in India and always maintained a special relationship with the country. India and Oman became strategic partners under his leadership.“The Government of Bangladesh acknowledges with deep gratitude the decision of the Government of India to confer the Gandhi Peace Prize 2020 to Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, posthumously for the first time. It is an honour for Bangladesh and its people for the Father of the Nation to be bestowed with this prestigious award,” Bangladesh’s ministry of foreign affairs said.The other members of the jury were the Chief Justice, the leader of the single largest Opposition party in the Lok Sabha, Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla, and Bindeshwar Pathak, founder of Sulabh International Social Service Organisation. Past awardees include former Tanzania president Julius Nyerere, Gerhard Fischer of Germany, the Ramakrishna Mission, Baba Amte, former South African president Nelson Mandela, the Grameen Bank of Bangladesh, Archbishop Desmond Tutu of South Africa, Chandi Prasad Bhatt and the Indian Space Research Organisation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gandhi-peace-prize-for-mujibur-rahman-late-sultan-of-oman-101616438512485.html
23-03-2021||India||Row over Maha minister rocks Parliament||Protests erupted in Parliament on Monday over the allegations of corruption by former Mumbai police chief Param Bir Singh against Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh, with Union minister Anurag Thakur demanding appropriate action against the state minister.The Rajya Sabha was adjourned amid protests and the Lok Sabha also saw sharp exchanges between Bharatiya Janata Party, Congress and Shiv Sena MPs. In the Lower House, BJP MP Manoj Kotak demanded a Central Bureau of Investigation probe into the matter.Speaking during the Question Hour in the Lok Sabha, Thakur said that the allegation that Deshmukh wanted police officers to collect ₹100 crore per month was a “matter of concern”.“The MPs not only from Maharashtra, but from all over India are concerned about the serious allegation of corruption (against Anil Deshmukh ) in Maharashtra... The state government should take appropriate action on the issue,” he said before many ruling party MPs raked up the issue during Zero Hour.Last week, former Mumbai Police commissioner Singh said that Deshmukh wanted police officers to collect ₹100 crore monthly from bars, restaurants and other establishments in Mumbai.In the Lok Sabha, BJP MP Rakesh Sinha emphasised that the allegations were raised by a former top cop and said: “The House wants to know why an API of Mumbai police was given a target of ₹100 crore? Perhaps this is the first such event in the country.”Sena MP Vinayak Raut alleged that the developments are a part of a larger conspiracy and the BJP is trying to topple the Maharashtra government. Congress MP Ravneet Singh Bittu termed the developments as a serious matter but questioned why principals of federalism were broken in all Opposition-ruled states, and central agencies were interfering.“The officers are always the main culprits. But they get away while we politicians fight against each other,” Bittu said. “We can fight against each other in assemblies, newspapers or Parliament.

23-03-2021||India||Param Bir Singh moves SC for CBI probe against Deshmukh||Shunted out over the case of explosives being found in an abandoned SUV outside billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s residence, Antilia and the subsequent arrest of suspended police officer Sachin Vaze in the case, former Mumbai Police Commissioner Param Bir Singh moved the Supreme Court on Monday, demanding a CBI probe against Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh for allegedly running a “money collection scheme” through the police department. In writ petition, Singh claimed that he was transferred to a low-key post in Mumbai Police’s Home Guards by an order on March 17 “immediately” after he brought the corrupt practices of Deshmukh to the knowledge of Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar and some other senior leaders in the state government. “The petitioner has invoked writ jurisdiction of this Hon’ble Court to seek unbiased, uninfluenced, impartial and fair investigation in the corrupt malpractices of Shri Anil Deshmukh, the Hon’ble Home Minister of Government of Maharashtra, before the evidence are destroyed,” said Singh’s petition, filed through advocate Abhinay. It contended that NCP leader Deshmukh held various meetings in February 2021 at his residence with police officers, including Sachin Vaze of Crime Intelligence Unit, Mumbai and Sanjay Patil, ACP (Social Service Branch), Mumbai, bypassing their seniors, and asked them to collect ₹100 crores every month from establishments such as bars, hookah parlours, restaurants. “The Home Minister has been instructing them to carry out official assignments and collection schemes, including financial transactions as per his instructions based on his expectations and targets to collect money,” said Singh, adding it was imperative to order a CBI probe before the CCTV camera footage at Deshmukh’s residence is destroyed. Singh has also submitted that he was being made a “scapegoat to divert attention” in the Antilla case, highlighting that while there were vertically five officers between him and Vaze, Deshmukh was the one meeting Vaze at his residence. In that case, now being investigated by the National Investigation Agency, Vaze has already been arrested. The state ATS has also named Vaze the main accused in the death of Mansukh Hiran who was in possession of the SUV found with the explosives, but reported it stolen a few days before the incident. Alleging that Deshmukh had also been interfering with investigations into several other cases, Singh claimed that the home minister pressured him “to probe the role of certain leaders of the Bharatiya Janata Party and somehow implicate them” in the abetment to suicide case of Mohan Delkar, the seven-time Lok Sabha MP from Dadar and Nagar Haveli who was found dead in a hotel in Mumbai’s Marine Drive area on February 22. “Fair CBI investigation is thus warranted in each of such acts of Shri Anil Deshmukh in abuse of the official position of the Hon’ble Home Minister,” said the petition. It added that Singh approached the top court for a CBI probe since the Maharashtra government has withdrawn its general consent for the central agency to carry out investigation in the state.Singh is likely to be represented in the top court by senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi. The petition is still to get a date of hearing in the top court. Singh, in his plea, has also called the decision to transfer him “a political move with oblique purposes and sinister motives”, besides in violation of the Rule 7 of the Indian Police Service (Cadre) Rules, 1954 which lays down that every officer shall hold the post for at least two years. The petition further said: “The transfer of the petitioner in the aforesaid circumstances is for reasons smeared with malice, when there is no iota of material or evidence – far from proof – found or even imputed against the petitioner, and is solely based on conjectures, surmises and pure speculation, without detail of any sort against the petitioner having been noticed by anybody. .” Singh said he was constrained to write a letter to the chief minister on March 20 regarding Deshmukh’s conduct after his transfer owing to adverse media publicity by Deshmukh, in violation of his right to reputation, dignity, equality and liberty. In his letter which came out in the public domain a day ago, Singh made a spate of accusations against Deshmukh, who refuted the allegations. On Monday, NCP chief Sharad Pawar also rejected Singh’s claim, saying Deshmukh was in the hospital from February 5-15 and later in home quarantine till February 27 – the period when Param Bir Singh claimed Vaze had met the home minister. Meanwhile, Singh on Monday took charge as the Director General (DG) of Maharashtra Home Guard, a police official said.Singh reached the Home Guard office in south Mumbai around noon but avoided speaking to media persons, the PTI reported.The Maharashtra government transferred Singh from the post and appointed senior IPS officer Hemant Nagrale, who was holding additional charge of Maharashtra DGP, as the new commissioner of Mumbai Police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/param-bir-singh-moves-sc-for-cbi-probe-against-deshmukh-101616438391112.html

23-03-2021||India||In TN manifesto, BJP vows laws on prohibition and forceful conversion||Chennai: The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Monday rolled out a dominant Hindutva pitch in its election manifesto for the April 6 Tamil Nadu elections, promising to enact legislations against cow slaughter and religious conversions through force or allurement. The party has also promised total prohibition in the state.The manifesto, released by Union minister Nitin Gadkari in Chennai, also had several promises to appease the Tamil electorate as the BJP is pulling all stops to make its entry into the Dravidian land. The BJP, in alliance with the ruling AIADMK, is facing the elections in 20 assembly constituencies and a bypoll in the Kanyakumari parliamentary seat. In a column titled ‘cow protection’, the BJP said that an ‘anti-cow slaughter Act’ will be “strictly implemented in the state” with a total ban on “smuggling of cows to Kerala and other states for beef and meat”. Goshalas will be established in temples to shelter cows “seized from cattle smugglers”, it added. The party has also said that temple administration would be handed over to a separate board that would be formed with Hindu scholars and saints. “This would replace the system of a secular government controlling only the Hindu religious temples,” the manifesto read. Stating that the right to freedom of religion is not the same as forcible religious conversions, BJP plans to enact “strict anti-conversion laws” to “criminalise religious conversion by force or allurement”. Promising total prohibition in a state where the state run liquor outlets- TASMAC is the highest revenue making business for the exchequer, the party said TASMAC employees who lose their jobs due to prohibition will be transferred to other government departments. Prohibition if often a talking point in Tamil Nadu elections and AIADMK and DMK have promised staggered shutting down of liquor outlets- a demand largely from the women electorate whose spouses are addicted to liquor and from anti-liquor activists. Total prohibition was in force in the state from 1937 to 1971 when the then DMK government headed by M Karunanidhi lifted it first.Besides this for women’s welfare, BJP has promised one-lakh to be deposited in the name of a girl child born in below- the poverty line families and free driving license for two- wheelers for those aged between 18 and 23. BJP has said it will trifurcate the Greater Chennai Corporation like New Delhi.To shed its image of being a north-Indian party imposing Hindi, the BJP has promised several measures for Tamils and the development of the language. A government order will be passed to make Tamil as the medium of instruction in public and private schools for classes 1 to 5. A stone inscription park for more than 1000 couplets from Thirukurral written by Tamil saintThiruvalluvar often quoted by Prime Minister Narendra will be set up in Erode district spanning 20-acres. Tamil will be announced as an official language at the Madras High Court by the party and its bench will be established in Coimbatore. A separate government will be created for Tamil migrants and the diaspora. Recommendations will be made to offer Indian citizenship to Sri Lankan refugees living in the state- a similar step made by their ally AIADMK in their manifesto. BJP has promised to make Tamil Nadu the number one state in south India in ease of doing business. The party has also emphasised on sports by announcing to include Jallikattu players in the sports quota. A 10% reservation under sports quota in education institutions would be revived, it said, adding that efforts will be taken for local martial arts, Silambam, to be recognised as national sports. The party has also stuck to its previous policies of National Education Policy and 10% reservation for economically poor people to be implemented fully. Like its ally AIADMK, BJP has also promised coaching centres to help students to clear NEET & other competitive exams which is a sensitive issue in the state. It has also promised free tablets for students of class 8 and 9 while the AIADMK promised 2G data to students and principal opposition, the DMK retained its 2016 assembly poll promise of free tablets with internet for students. Fishermen would get ₹6000 assistance annually like farmers and a separate budget for agriculture will be introduced like other BJP states. 60-lakh job opportunities will be generated. Free piped drinking water supply to all homes will be provided by 2022 under Jal Jeevan Mission. There will be a ban on sand mining for 5 years to protect riverbeds and several river linking schemes have been announced. In the health sector, multispeciality hospitals in all districts will be established offering free treatment and air ambulances will be available in Chennai and major city public hospitals. The famed Kalakshetra for art forms in Chennai will be established in all districts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-tn-manifesto-bjp-vows-laws-on-prohibition-and-forceful-conversion-101616438273208.html
23-03-2021||India||Stalin blames BJP and AIADMK for deaths of anti-Sterlite protesters||Chennai Raising the poll pitch in Tamil Nadu, Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) chief M K Stalin on Monday alleged that the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) were hand in glove in the police firing that claimed 13 lives during the anti-Sterlite protests in Thoothukudi in 2018. Besides this, Stalin also referred to the alleged custodial deaths of P Jeyaraj and his son, J Bennicks, who were picked up in June last year for reportedly running their mobile shop beyond the designated hours during the coronavirus lockdown.Recalling the protests against the Sterlite plant, Stalin, who was addressing a poll campaign in Thoothukudi, said: “They were peaceful protesters who were marching towards the district administration, demanding that the pollution-causing Sterlite plant be shut and they were shot down like crows.”“As soon as I heard the news, I came to Thoothukudi. I never saw such a scene in my life and we should never see it again. The perpetrators have still not been punished. We should teach this government a lesson,” he added. In 2018, 13 people were killed after villagers in Tuticorin clashed with the police during an agitation against the proposed expansion of a copper smelter of Sterlite Copper, a unit of the Vedanta group, over pollution concerns. Accusing the BJP-led Centre for allegedly stalling the probe led by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) into the firing, Stalin alleged that Justice Aruna Jagadeesan commission appointed by Chief Minister Edappadi Palaniswami had not submitted a report into the incident even after three years. “The two regimes have come together for the election. Don’t you want to teach them a lesson?” Stalin told the crowd. “When reporters asked the chief minister (about the firing), he said that he had just watched it on the news. How can he continue in this post?” Attacking the government over the custodial death of the father-son duo, Stalin alleged that a First Information Report (FIR) filed by the police said that Jayaraj and Benicks died due to the injuries they had sustained when they rolled on the ground to evade arrest, a claim that was later debunked from the CCTV footage of the store. AIADMK’s sitting MLA and incumbent S P Shanmuganathan from Srivaikuntam constituency in Thoothukudi denied the charges. “The wrong-doers are being punished and the victims’ families were compensated by our government,” Shanmuganathan said, adding: “The problem is over, Stalin is just taking it up for politics. Those who were affected by these two incidents are ready to support the AIADMK.”Nine policemen were sent to jail on charges of murder with the Madurai bench of the Madras high court dismissing the bail pleas of four of them on Monday. The DMK chief lauded the district for standing up for their rights during these two incidents. The DMK and its allies (Communist parties, Congress, Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi and Indian Union Muslim League) are contesting in six assembly constituencies in Thoothukudi, where the AIADMK and DMK have three seats each. Stalin’s sister K Kanimozhi was elected as an MP from Thoothukudi Lok Sabha constituency in the 2019 elections and has been at the forefront of the protests in the above two cases. This time, TTV Dhinakaran, the chief ministerial candidate of the Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam (AMMK), is also contesting from one of the assembly constituencies – Kovilpatti – of the district to take on AIADMK’s incumbent MLA and information minister Kadambur Raju. In 2016 assembly polls, Raju won this seat by a thin margin of 428 votes. Dhinkaran, meanwhile, is banking on the support of the Mukkalathor community to which his family, including his aunt and former chief minister J Jayalaithaa’s aide V K Sasikala and deputy chief minister O Panneerselvam belong.CPI(M)’s K Srinivasan will also fight the polls from this seat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/stalin-blames-bjp-and-aiadmk-for-deaths-of-anti-sterlite-protesters-101616437971047.html

Rawat was due to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Delhi this week, but the trip was called off after he contracted the contagious pathogen.“My Corona test report has come positive. I am fine and not facing any difficulty. I have isolated myself under the monitoring of doctors. Those of you who have come into contact with me in last few days, should be cautious and get their tests done. I wish good health to all,” Rawat tweeted.He visited Haridwar three times after becoming CM on March 10, and mingled with pilgrims and ascetics, with hardly anyone following Covid safety norms. Rawat was not wearing a mask in several images taken of him in Haridwar on the day of the “shahi snan” (holy dip) on March 11, when the crowds swelled to 3.3 million. After Rawat took over as CM, he said that there should not be any restrictions on pilgrims wishing to come to Mahakumbh after April 1. Two days ago, during a visit to Haridwar, Rawat said: “Nobody will be stopped in the name of Covid-19, as we are sure the faith in God will overcome the fear of the virus.” Worried about the situation in Haridwar in the context of the Mahakumbh and Rawat’s statements, the Centre on Sunday wrote to the Uttarakhand government to take stringent measures to check Covid spread during the Kumbh. Haridwar has highest active cases of all 13 districts in the state at the moment.Since taking over as chief minister of the state on March 10, Rawat has courted several controversies.On Sunday, at a public function, he said that “the US had enslaved India for 200 years”, and questioned why people do not have 20 children if they wanted more subsidised rations during Covid.On March 16, Rawat objected to people, particularly women, wearing ripped jeans.“Ripped jeans paves the way for societal breakdown and is a bad example parents set for their children. Wearing ripped jeans is not our culture but aping westernisation,” he said.Rights activists and the opposition Congress slammed the CM over his comments.“Don’t know what has happened to the CM. Is it lack of wisdom or lack of education or is he doing it deliberately? First, he made a derogatory statement on the attire of women, and then he made a highly insulting statement on producing children”, Congress spokesperson Garima Dasauni said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/twist-of-faith-u-khand-cm-tests-covid-positive-101616437912335.html

What has the report said and what is the existing legal regime under the POCSO Act?Why has the report made a recommendation for bringing down the juvenile delinquency age?The panel underlined a consistent rise in the cases registered under the POCSO Act between 2017 and 2019. The number of POCSO cases in 2017 was 31,668, which increased to 38,802 in 2018. A total of 46,005 cases were registered in 2019.Noting that there had been a large number of cases under the POCSO Act where delinquent juveniles were the offenders, the committee expressed concerns that minor sexual offenders may commit more serious and heinous crime if the issue was left unaddressed.Also Read | Everyday 4 child victims of sexual abuse denied justice, study finds“The committee believes that minor sexual offenders may commit more serious and heinous crimes if left untreated/uncounselled. Therefore, it is very important to relook at these provisions because more and more juveniles are getting involved in such crimes,” stated the report.It, thus, recommended that the ministry of home affairs should take up the matter with the ministry of women and child development “to review the current age limit of 18 years and see if it can be reduced to 16 years for the applicability of the POCSO Act, 2012.”What is POCSO Act and the definition of a “child” therein?POCSO Act came into force in June 2012, putting in place a legal regime to protect the children from offences of sexual assault, harassment and pornography. The provisions under the law provide for safeguarding the interests of the child at every stage of the judicial process by incorporating child-friendly mechanisms for reporting, recording of evidence, investigation and speedy trial of offences through designated special courts.The Act defines different forms of sexual abuse which includes penetrative and non-penetrative assault, sexual harassment, use of child for pornography, child trafficking etc. It makes it the legal duty of a person aware of the offence to report the sexual abuse, failing which the person can be punished with imprisonment of six months or a fine. The law mandates the special court to complete the trial within one year from the date of taking cognisance of the abuse.Section 1(d) of the Act defines a “child” as any person below the age of 18 years. The definition of “child” applies both to the victims as well as offenders. This definition is in consonance with the definition of “child” under the Juvenile Justice Act. Under Section 2(12) of the Juvenile Justice Act, a “child” means a person who has not completed 18 years of age.How are juveniles tried under the present system of law? Delinquents below 18 are tried under the Juvenile Justice Act, 2000, which calls them “children in conflict of law”. Age on the date of the offence is the basis for determining whether a delinquent should be tried as a child or an adult.Under the juvenile justice system, a delinquent found guilty of committing any offence can be housed in a special home for a maximum period of three years, following which he or she must be released.Also Read | Man raped 5-yr-old last month. Judge fast-tracks trial, orders death penaltyHowever, the Juvenile Justice Act of 2000 was amended in 2015 with a provision, allowing for delinquents between the age of 16 and 18 to be tried as adults under certain circumstances. While the amended Act does not make it mandatory for all in the age group 16-18 to be tried as adults, it states that those committing a heinous offence — one that attracts a minimum punishment of seven years — can be tried as adults before a regular court instead of a juvenile court.This amendment was brought in the wake of the December 2012 gang rape case in the national Capital when one of the perpetrators was found to be a juvenile (17 years of age) and his trial was shifted to a juvenile court. On December 20, 2015, despite massive public outcry, the juvenile was released from the correction home after he completed three years.Set up to revamp the criminal laws, Justice JS Verma committee made several recommendations in 2013 but stated that it was not inclined to reduce the age of a juvenile from 18 to 16. However, the then minister of women and child development, Maneka Gandhi, asserted the need to create a distinction in law based on the gravity of crime committed by a juvenile. The amendment was proposed by her ministry in 2014, leading to the amendment in the Juvenile Justice Act the next year.There are 21 such sections under the Indian Penal Code alone where the minimum punishment is seven years in jail after conviction. Besides, there are a host of provisions in other laws such as Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act, Arms Act, Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act and Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA) in which juveniles can be tried as adults.What is the procedure to try a juvenile as an adult? Section 15 of the Juvenile Justice Act lays down the procedure for a “preliminary assessment” of a juvenile above the age of 16 years in cases of heinous offences. There are three parameters for conducting a preliminary assessment to determine whether the child should be tried as an adult or under the juvenile justice system.This includes his mental and physical capacity to commit such offence, ability to understand the consequences of the offence and the circumstances in which he allegedly committed the offence.A juvenile court relies on a probation officer’s social investigation report and a government hospital’s mental health report and may also take the assistance of experienced psychologists or psycho-social workers or other experts before arriving at a conclusion. If a juvenile court finds that the child can be tried as an adult, the case is transferred to a designated children’s court, which again decides whether the decision is correct or not.Also Read | 65-year-old man held for raping 4-year-old girl in Bihar’s Vaishali districtUnder the new law, juveniles can be sentenced to imprisonment, including imprisonment for life. However, it prohibits imposition of death penalty and life imprisonment without the possibility of release.There are many sections in the POCSO Act where the minimum punishment is more than seven years in jail. For example, the minimum punishment for penetrative sexual assault under the POCSO Act is ten years in jail whereas it is 20 years’ imprisonment for aggravated penetrative sexual assault. In all these cases, a juvenile can be tried as an adult after complying with the procedure prescribed under the 2015 amendment.However, there are several other crimes under the POCSO Act in which the maximum punishment is up to seven years in jail or less. The punishment for sexual assault under POCSO Act is a minimum of three years up to a maximum of five years. Punishment for aggravated sexual assault is for a term not less than five years but may extend to seven years. Similarly, POCSO Act provides that whosoever commits sexual harassment upon a child shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to three years. Commercial use of pornographic material involving a child is an offence punishable up to five years in jail.If one looks at the conclusion of the parliamentary committee, it has recommended a change in the definition of “child” under the POCSO Act by reducing the cut off age from 18 to 16. By doing so, irrespective of the nature or severity of the offence, anyone above 16 will have to be tried like an adult if accused under the POCSO Act. However, this will require parliamentary approval and necessary changes in the POCSO Act as well as the Juvenile Justice Act.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/decoding-the-proposed-changes-in-the-pocso-act-101616387029216.html
