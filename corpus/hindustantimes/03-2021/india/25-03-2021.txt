He died due to Covid-19 related complications on September 23 last year.The party has named Sharanu Salagar as its choice from Basavakalyan in Bidar district.The BJP continued to show its gratitude to the 17 defectors as it named Pratapgouda Patil as its choice from Maski in Raichur district. Patil was one of the 17 legislators who engineered the collapse of the HD Kumaraswamy-led Janata Dal (Secular) or JD(S)-Congress government in 2019, defected to the BJP and helped Yediyurappa come to power as the chief minister of Karnataka for the fourth time.The Janata Dal (Secular) or JD(S) has announced that it will contest both Basavakalyan and Maski by-polls. The Congress on the other hand has announced candidates for all three constituencies that provide Yediyurappa with an opportunity to silence the growing calls for his removal from within his own party, analysts said.BJP won Belagavi in 2019 while the Congress had won both Basavakalyan and Maski seats in 2018.Yediyurappa has shown his gratitude to almost all those who helped him to power as they occupy nearly half of the cabinet berths in the state. However, one of those turncoats, Ramesh Jarkiholi has found himself in the thick of a raging sex-scandal in Karnataka that has further pushed Yediyurappa to a corner.Jarkiholi, one of the catalysts in the defection drama, had to resign from the cabinet after a social activist filed a complaint of sexual harassment on behalf of the alleged victim.The alleged sex-for-job scandal continues to haunt the BJP government in Karnataka as the opposition has sought a court-monitored probe into the case and also demanded that a case of rape be filed.Since the Jarkiholi incident, six other ministers who had defected to the BJP with Jarkiholi have also gone to court and secured an injunction that restricts at least 68 media houses, social media platforms and others from publishing, circulating or broadcasting any material considered defamatory to them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-announces-suresh-angadi-s-widow-as-its-candidate-for-belagavi-bypolls-101616696906084.html

The moves will be implemented in Bengaluru as Bengaluru Urban is one of the top 10 districts of the country with the highest number of active Covid cases at present.The government developed 'Quarantine Watch' app last year to monitor people who are coming from outside. People who are advised home quarantine will have to register themselves on this app giving through mobile number and will have to upload their quarantining photos on the application so that the authorities can verify that such an individual is not flouting home isolation rules. The location of the individual will also be mapped through the application.Negative RT-PCR report must for all passengers arriving in BengaluruThe government is also bringing back the stamping of the hands of people advised to quarantine with indelible ink. This process will begin in a few days, Karnataka health and medical education minister Dr K Sudhakar said.Last year, Karnataka earned praise for its high-tech approach to Covid-19 as the state government readied a Covid war room and developed two apps — Corona Watch and Quarantine Watch to tighten its surveillance on people.As the number of cases went down, the watch became relaxed over time, but now with the resurgence of cases, the tech measures are on their way back, the government said.The government has also made RT-PCR test report mandatory for anyone visiting the state as 60 per cent of Bengaluru's cases have an interstate travel history.Karnataka's 5-point plan to stop the spread of the infection> Strict monitoring of quarantined people through Quarantine watch.> RT-PCR test report mandatory irrespective of the state from where an individual is travelling.> A penalty of ₹5,000 to 10,000 to be imposed on establishments found flouting social distancing norms.> Not more than 50 to 100 people can attend birthday parties, funerals. Open-area wedding can host 500 people while the number should be 200 for closed-space wedding parties.> The state is targeting to test one lakh samples for Covid-19 infection per day.On Thursday, the state recorded 2,523 fresh cases and 10 deaths. This was the third consecutive day that the state's daily dally breached the 2,000-mark. Out of these cases, 1623 infections have been reported from Bengaluru urban district alone.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-brings-back-quarantine-watch-app-hand-stamping-as-covid-cases-rise-101616691572892.html

25-03-2021||India||To meet domestic demand, vaccine exports to be done in phased manner||India will continue to supply Covid-19 vaccines to other countries, though the rollout will be in a phased manner and delivery schedules are expected to be calibrated in sync with domestic requirements, people familiar with developments said on Thursday. Explaining the government’s decision to focus on the domestic vaccination programme and not to expand vaccine exports, the people said on condition of anonymity that the phased supplies to other countries will be made over the coming weeks and months. Noting that no other country had so far matched India in supplying more than 60.5 million doses of vaccines as grants, commercial supplies and supplies to the COVAX facility, the people also made it clear that the government has not imposed a ban on vaccine exports. As reported by Hindustan Times, the government has decided to focus on meeting the needs of the domestic immunisation programme following a sudden spike in the total number of Covid-19 cases in recent days, and the move to open up the vaccination drive to everyone above the age of 45 from April 1. “We had said that keeping in view domestic requirements, India will continue to supply Covid-19 vaccines to partner countries over the coming weeks and months in a phased manner. This position remains unchanged,” said one of the people cited above. “We have not imposed any ban on exports of vaccines unlike many other countries,” the person added. India remains committed to help other countries with vaccines, including through the WHO-backed COVAX facility. In view of the country’s current manufacturing capacity and the needs of the national vaccination programme, “there may be a need to calibrate the supply schedules from time to time”, the person said. All stakeholders will have to work together to adjust the schedules as needed. “Only by such cooperation, we can collectively deal with the pandemic,” the person said. India has so far provided vaccines to 77 countries around the world, including more than 8.5 million doses as grants, 34.1 million doses as commercial supplies and 17.8 million doses through the COVAX facility. However, vaccine exports have slowed down as domestic demands increased over the past week. The last country to receive made-in-India vaccines was South Sudan, which was provided 132,000 doses through the COVAX facility on March 22. India began vaccine exports just five days after rolling out its domestic vaccination programme on January 16. Supplies under the COVAX facility were made as soon as purchase orders were placed. Future vaccine exports are also linked to the ramping up of domestic production capacities and the grant of emergency use authorisations for more vaccines. Serum Institute of India (SII), the world’s largest vaccine manufacturer, plans to increase production of the AstraZeneca vaccine or Covishield to 100 million doses a month by April, up from the current level of 70 million doses. With more than 11.7 million cases, India has reported the highest number of Coronavirus infections after the US and Brazil.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/to-meet-domestic-demand-vaccine-exports-to-be-done-in-phased-manner-101616689944354.html
25-03-2021||India||‘Criticizing govt’s inaction doesn’t amount to hate speech’: Supreme Court||Frowning at the attempt of branding strong disapproval of government’s inaction by citizens as hate speech, the Supreme Court on Thursday said, “Disapprobation of governmental inaction cannot be branded as an attempt to promote hatred between different communities.”Examining a petition by Shillong Times Editor Patricia Mukhim, who sought to quash criminal cases lodged against her over a Facebook post, a bench of Justices L Nageswara Rao and S Ravindra Bhat said, “Free speech of the citizens of this country cannot be stifled by implicating them in criminal cases unless such speech has the tendency to affect public order.”The Court quashed the criminal case lodged against Mukhim in July last year by terming the complaint against her a “figment of imagination”. She faced proceedings under Sections 153A (promoting enmity or doing acts prejudicial to maintenance of harmony), 500 (defamation) and inciting violence punishable under Section 505(c) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) on a complaint by a village tribal body, locally known as Dorbar Shnong, which was offended by the journalist’s Facebook post of July 4.In her post, Mukhim had condemned an attack on some non-tribal boys and sought the intervention of the Meghalaya chief minister, also demanding the Dorbar Shnong to take remedial steps against such attacks against non-tribals which have been continuing since 1979.The bench said, “Where allegations made in the FIR or the complaint, even if they are taken on their face value and accepted in their entirety do not prima facie constitute any offence or make out a case against the accused, the FIR is liable to be quashed.”Advocate Vrinda Grover, who appeared for Mukhim, had challenged the order of the Meghalaya High Court of November 10, 2020, refusing to stay the proceedings. She claimed that the petitioner had a fundamental right of free speech and liberty under Articles 19(1)(a) and 21 of the Constitution.The bench said that the fervent plea made by the appellant in her post for the protection of non-tribals living in Meghalaya and for their equality cannot, by any stretch of the imagination, be categorized as hate speech. “…if the victims voice their discontent, and speak out, especially if the state authorities turn a blind eye, or drag their feet, such voicing of discontent is really a cry for anguish, for justice denied – or delayed. This is exactly what appears to have happened in this case,” added the bench.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/criticizing-govt-s-inaction-doesn-t-amount-to-hate-speech-supreme-court-101616688444428.html

The commercial operation of passenger flights will begin from March 28,” the chief minister said, addressing a gathering after the inauguration of the airport. The first commercial flight of IndiGo from Bengaluru will land at Kurnool airport at 10 am on March 28. “Initially, flights would be operated to four destinations – Visakhapatnam, Chennai and Bengaluru,” he said. The airport, which is owned by the Andhra Pradesh Airports Development Corporation Ltd (APADC) got the aerodrome licence from the Director General of Civil Aviation on January 15 this year. The Bureau of Civil Aviation Security (BCAS) gave the security clearance to the airport on January 27 for the commencement of scheduled aircraft operations after final security vetting. Christening the airport after Uyyalavada Narasimha Reddy, a palegar (a feudal landlord) from this area who fought against British oppression in 1840s, the chief minister said the airport would provide a place for the judicial capital on the national airways map along with other major airports of the country. He said the APADC had spent over ₹110 crore to construct all the facilities including the passenger terminal building, five-storeyed air traffic control, administrative building, police barracks, passenger lounge, VIP lounge and other work on war-footing in the last two years. Jagan complimented the authorities concerned for obtaining all licences and permissions for the Kurnool airport to make it ready for commercial operation of flights in record time. The Kurnool airport was constructed on 1008 acres of land with a runway length of 2 km which could be expandable to 3.1 km in future. There are two taxi ways and four parking stands for the parking of four aircrafts simultaneously.

A university spokesman said in a statement that the mess facility in the university would be closed with effect from Thursday afternoon and all the students have been asked to vacate their hostel rooms with immediate effect. The university authorities also issued a circular stating that all examinations for all courses scheduled from Thursday had been postponed indefinitely. “The university will soon release a revised timetable,” the circular said. The sudden closure of the university hostels and mess facilities left the students in the lurch. On Wednesday night, hundreds of students took out a protest demonstration at the NCC gate and women’s hostel, forcing the authorities to call for deployment of police personnel. As the students blocked the main thoroughfare on the OU campus till the midnight, the police arrested the student union leaders including All India Students Federation state organising secretary RN Shankar, executive member Uday Kumar and OU students’ federation leader Sumer, Progressive Democratic Students Union leaders G Shyam and others. The police shifted the arrested leaders to Nallakunta police station, before releasing them on Thursday morning. “The students lost most part of the academic year due to the Coronavirus pandemic. It has been not even three or four months since the hostels were open for students. Most of them are from rural areas, and have no access to online education. They are staying in hostels and are preparing for the University examinations as well as various competitive examinations. Where would they go suddenly, if they are asked to vacate the hostels?” AISF leader Shankar said. The students’ union leader pleaded with the authorities to allow them to remain in the hostels, even if the mess facilities are closed, but the authorities said they have to follow the government rules. The Telangana State Council of Higher Education (TSCHE), too, announced postponement of all semester exams of various undergraduate and postgraduate courses under different universities across the state. “We have postponed all degree and PG semester exams under all universities. A revised schedule will be announced soon by the universities concerned,” TSCHE Chairman Prof T Papi Reddy said. The University of Hyderabad announced that the decision to allow the return of terminal semester PG students and research scholars (except the 2020 batch) to the campus was being put on hold until further notice.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/osmania-students-protest-against-telangana-s-move-to-close-varsities-hostels-101616683524104.html
25-03-2021||India||‘Dissent is being criminalised’: Mehbooba Mufti after ED questioning||Jammu and Kashmir Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) president and former chief minister Mehbooba Mufti, soon after being questioned by the officials of Enforcement Directorate (ED) in connection with a money laundering case, today said that the country is not ruled according to the constitution and dissent has been criminalised.Without naming the BJP, Mufti said that the country is being run as per the agenda of a political party.The ED had first summoned Mufti to Delhi for investigation in the money laundering case. However, she refused to travel to the national capital due to Covid-19. On Thursday, she was questioned at the ED office Rajbagh for five hours, soon after she went there at 11 am.After coming out, the PDP chief said that she was questioned about the land and property of his father Mufti Mohammad Sayeed at Bijbhera in south Kashmir and other related details including how that was sold and how much money was received. “I was questioned about the funds as the chief minister and any money spent on youth engagement programs and how that was done,” she said.“This country is ruled either by the ED, the CBI or the NIA, either you are charged in sedition or money laundering and whosoever talks on issues EDI/CBI or NIA is used against him. This country is not running according to the constitution of India, it’s running according to the agenda of a particular party. Dissent has been criminalised in the country,” she said.The former chief minister said that she has nothing to hide. “My hands are clean and have nothing to hide. It took them two years to search things and now they are asking details about my father’s land or how much money was spent on the mausoleum of my father. They’re asking about the secret fund, how it was used and the widows who got the fund. Our party PDP will remain steadfast on its agenda for which the party was formed,” she stated.Mufti was summoned for questioning by the ED on March 15 in a money laundering case when a team of the federal agency reached the PDP chief’s Fairview residence with the summons.Soon after the ED officials’ visit to her house, Mufti had said in a tweet that such short-sighted scheming would not work.“GOI’s tactics to intimidate and browbeat political opponents to make them toe their line has become tediously predictable. They don’t want us to raise questions about its punitive actions and policies. Such short-sighted scheming won’t work.”Earlier, she had said that she was ready to appear before the ED in Srinagar for any sort of investigations. However, due to Covid-19, she declined to travel to New Delhi.Since her release, Mufti has been vocal against the Centre, especially the BJP government, for the revocation of Articles 370 and 35A. She even said that her party’s fight is not for Jammu and Kashmir’s statehood but for the special status which was taken away by the Centre on August 5, 2019.She is the second former chief minister of J&K to appear before the ED after Srinagar MP and former CM Farooq Abdullah who appeared before the ED officials at Rajbagh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dissent-is-being-criminalised-mehbooba-mufti-after-ed-questioning-101616683043899.html

This effectively means that passengers may have to wait in the queue to enter metro stations.This comes a couple of days after the Delhi government identified the Metro to be one of the super-spreader zones including other places such as cinema halls, weekly markets and malls. The national capital has been witnessing a steady increase of Covid-19 with a positivity rate touching 1.54 per cent and 1,254 fresh cases on Wednesday.“Due to the strict reinforcement of the social distancing norms, the passengers are advised to plan their journey in advance and allow for additional time of 20-30 minutes for their commute. If possible, off-peak hour travel may also be opted by those who have the flexibility to avoid overcrowding/long wait during peak hours,” Anuj Dayal, executive director (corporate communications), DMRC, said on Thursday.The DMRC is also set to increase the number of flying squads checking for mask and physical distancing violations. Entry would be strictly regulated as per Covid-19 physical distancing protocols at the major metro stations including Rajiv Chowk, Barakhamba Road, Central Secretariat, Patel Chowk, ITO, especially during morning and evening peak hours.“While waiting in the queue, the passengers will be strictly required to wait on the marked social distancing circles/stripes. If it is found that the distancing is not followed at stations, entry gates will be closed for passengers at those stations until the distancing is ensured,” DMRC said in a statement Thursday.Officials also said that they will be writing to district officials to maintain physical distancing outside the metro station as “there might be a spike in passengers waiting outside the stations while waiting for their turn to enter stations in line with social distancing norms.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-metro-to-tighten-measures-to-check-covid-19-spread-101616682623943.html
25-03-2021||India||Union minister Rajnath Singh says Mamata Banerjee took West Bengal back to 19th century||Accusing Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee of "taking back Bengal to the 19th century, with no development work undertaken in the past 10 years", Defence Minister Rajnath Singh on Thursday said the TMC dispensation, just like its predecessor, the Left Front, has wronged the people of the state.Singh, during his public meeting here in Purulia district, took a dig at the TMC's 'khela hobe' (game will be played) slogan, and said Bengal, now on, will witness only work and development.Alleging that the TMC supremo delivers speeches encouraging acts of violence and aggression, the union minister wondered if the chief minister "seeks to divide the country" by repeatedly terming people who have come from other states as outsiders.He also sought to know if people from Bengal are treated as outsiders elsewhere.Stressing that the Bharatiya Jan Sangh, which later became the BJP, was established by Syama Prasad Mookerjee -- a son of Bengal -- Singh said, "Will any brother from this state be considered an outsider in Uttar Pradesh? All people born on the soil of India are brothers to each other."Claiming that the TMC dispensation has done nothing for the people of Bengal, Singh said, "How is it possible that those belonging to one party (BJP) are outsiders, while you, having ruined Bengal, are an insider? The CM, instead of undertaking development work, makes thoughtless remarks."Neither 'Maa nor mati or manush' (mother, motherland, and people) feel safe in the state."'Maa, Mati, manush' is another slogan that was coined by the TMC during 2009 general election.Singh further accused Banerjee of not fulfilling her promise of putting an end to water crisis in the state."Prime Minister Narendra Modi, on his part, has promised piped water availablility in every household of the country by the end of 2024," the defence minister stated.Maintaining that the BJP government at the Centre has never discriminated against the people of the state, as often alleged by the TMC, the senior saffron party leader said, "The Congress-led UPA government at the Centre had given ₹1.32 lakh crore to Bengal under the 13th Finance Commission, while the Modi government allotted ₹4.48 lakh crore to the state under the 14th Finance Commission."Insisting that more than 150 saffron camp workers have been killed in West Bengal, the senir BJP leader said that it is the responsibility of the state's chief minister to ensure the safety and security of its people, no matter which party they bore allegiance to."Bomb-making factories are openly being run in Bengal. If the same had happened in Uttar Pradesh (of which he was once the chief minister), the matter would have been dealt with sternly."The BJP, if allowed to form government in Bengal, will make security arrangements not just for saffron camp workers, but also those belonging to the Congress, Left and the TMC," he said, exuding confidence that his party will bag more than 200 seats in the state.Emphasising that the BJP is not a party that creates enmity between people, he said, the TMC supremo has been trying to divide the people of Bengal on religious lines."The BJP will not practice discrimination on the basis of religion. It would rather punish anyone creating trouble or indulging in such crimes. Now no one will be able to stop Durga Puja celebrations or Saraswati Puja in Bengal," he said.Controversy had erupted in 2017 at a school in Tehatta, Nadia district, over celebration of Saraswati puja, with one section of students apparently trying to stop another group from observing the festival.In that very year, the West Bengal government had tried imposing curbs on Durga idol immersion, as the occasion coincided with Muharram, but the high court later eased the restrictions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/union-minister-rajnath-singh-says-mamata-banerjee-took-west-bengal-back-to-19th-century-101616680181804.html

25-03-2021||India||Despite agitation against privatisation move, Vizag steel plant achieves record production||While continuing their one-and-a-half months-long agitation to prevent the privatisation of Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Limited (RINL), also known as the Visakhapatnam Steel Plant, the workers have also been striving to improve the productivity of the company and bring it back into profits.Between Tuesday and Wednesday, there was a record production of 20,400 tonnes of hot metal in the steel plant.“This is the highest production since the inception of the plant in the 80s. On March 6, the plant achieved a record production of 20,350 tonnes,” RP Sharma, spokesperson of Visakhapatnam Steel Plant, said.All three blast furnaces, each having a production capacity of 7,150 tonnes, are running round the clock. “We have achieved nearly 98 per cent productivity in the company, thanks to the dedication of the workers despite their anxiety over the government’s decision,” Sharma said.Trade union leaders said the workers wanted to prove to the Centre that if given an opportunity, they could completely turn around the company’s financial position and bring it back into profits. According to the trade union leaders, the RINL has been making consistent profits for the last four months. In December 2020, the company made a net profit of ₹212 crore. In January this year, the net profit of the company was ₹134 crore. “After the announcement of privatisation by the Centre in February, too, the workers strived hard to achieve a net profit of ₹165 crore and as the financial year closes by March-end, the company is likely to get the profit of around ₹300 crore,” J Ayodhya Ramu, trade union leader and convenor of Visakha Ukku Parirakshana Samithi (Visakha Steel Protection Committee) said.Though the trade unions have given the strike notice to the management on March 11, stating they would go on an indefinite strike any day after March 25, they have not taken any decision yet. “We have been working like disciplined soldiers. A strike is our last option,” All India Trade Union Congress (AITUC) leader of the steel plant, A Adinarayana, said.The company spokesman said the RINL had, in fact, undergone a tough phase last year due to the Covid-19 pandemic. “We had to shut down two of the three furnaces and only one furnace was in operation for six months. Subsequently, the workers were allowed in full shifts and the plant operations were back in full swing only in the last four or five months,” Sharma said.The steel plant, which had a turnover of ₹16,000 crore in 2019-20, is expected to achieve a turnover of nearly ₹17,000 crore in 2020-21, despite the crisis prevailing in the plant due to the pandemic. “This month alone, the company is targeting a record production of 7 lakh tonnes of hot metal and the turnover is likely to touch ₹3,200 crore,” the spokesman added.The main reason cited by the Centre for privatising the RINL was that it had been consistently making losses for four years out of the last five years. It reported a loss of ₹1,604 crore in 2015-16, ₹1,263 crore in 2016-17 and ₹1,369 crore in 2017-18. The company made a profit of ₹96.7 crore in 2018-19 but plunged into a huge loss of ₹3,319 crore in 2019-20.Besides, the RINL is also facing a huge debt burden of ₹22,000 crore, which is being serviced at 14 per cent.The trade union leaders, however, say the losses or the debt burden of the company were insignificant compared to the huge assets of the steel plant. “The problem is not with the steel plant or the workers. It is with the management. We have all the strength and resources to make it a profitable venture if the government gives us a helping hand,” Ramu said.He reiterated that the RINL can bounce back into profits if it is allotted captive mines, which reduces the burden of procuring iron ore by nearly ₹3,500 crore a year, and the interest on the loan outstanding is reduced from 14 per cent to eight per cent as being extended to private industrialists.“In the name of getting rid of the loss-making company, the Centre is virtually killing a golden goose,” Adinarayana said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/despite-agitation-against-privatisation-move-vizag-steel-plant-achieves-record-production-101616679803729.html

On Wednesday, Rawat had shared information that he and his wife, his daughter and son had tested positive for Covid-19. Rawat had tweeted, “Finally Corona pahalwan (wrestler) has gripped me. During noontime, today, decided to get my wife, daughter, Sumit Rawat, Puran Rawat, tested. I was hesitant to get myself tested. Then I thought I should also get tested, and it was the right thing I did.” Rawat had further tweeted, “I got myself tested. My test report was positive and four members of my family have also tested positive. Those who have come into my contact till noon today should kindly get themselves tested as this caution is a must.” With assembly elections scheduled less than a year later in the state, Rawat had been busy attending various public events and meeting people in different parts of Uttarakhand. On Monday, Uttarakhand CM Tirath Singh Rawat had also tested positive for Covid-19. In December last year, then chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat had also tested positive for the viral infection and isolated himself at his residence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-leader-harish-rawat-airlifted-to-aiims-delhi-day-after-he-tested-covid-19-positive-101616676983461.html

25-03-2021||India||Covid-19: In a first, duration of Haridwar's Kumbh Mela curtailed to one month||The duration of the 'Kumbh Mela' in Uttarakhand's Haridwar has been curtailed to just one month for the first time in its history in view of a recent surge in Covid-19 cases, news agency PTI reported on Thursday. Yesterday, the Uttarakhand government had made it mandatory for devotees to bring a negative RT-PCR report not older than 72 hours for attending the upcoming mega congregation.The occasion usually lasts around three-and-a-half months. Its last edition was held in Haridwar from January 14 to April 28 in 2010. According to a new notification, the congregation on the banks of the Ganges in Haridwar in Uttarakhand will now take place from April 1 to 30, with three 'shahi snan' (major bathing) dates on April 12, 14 and 27.Also Read: Negative Covid test report mandatory to attend Kumbh Mela: Uttarakhand govtThe temple city of Haridwar is in the final stages of preparations to host the 'Kumbh Mela', which is slated to start from April 1. On the other hand, the Covid-19 cases in Uttarakhand, which lay low for a few months, are once again showing a rising trend of late. 200 new coronavirus infections were reported on Wednesday, of which the maximum were detected in Haridwar (71 cases). Dehradun, the state's winter capital, reported 63 cases, while as many as 22 cases were reported from Nainital, according to a Covid-19 control room bulletin.The rising number of cases forms a cause of concern for the administration since thousands of devotees take a dip in the holy river during the mela, with their number increasing manifold on the days of 'shahi snan'. Authorities also expect heavy turnouts on the occasions of Chaitra Pratipada on April 13 and Ram Navami on April 21.The Kumbh Kshetra (area) covers Neergarh, Tapovan, Bitthal Ashram Marg to Muni-Ki-Reti Road and Rishi-Haridwar bypass in the north; and Narendra Nagar-Rishikesh bypass, the forest check-post on Rishikesh-Dehradun Road, Rishikesh-Haridwar bypass, Mansa Devi, Billkeshwar Mandir, Tibri Mohand, BHEL residential buildings, Roorkee-Bahadarabad road and up to 13 km on Haridwar-Delhi road in the west. In the south, the congregation area will extend from Bahadarabad-Haridwar bypass to Siddha Sot Setu and from Siddha Sot Setu to Neelkanth Mahadev temple in the east.Soon after taking over as the chief minister of Uttarakhand, Tirath Singh Rawat had said that it was not compulsory to bring a negative RT-PCR test report for devotees gathering for the Kumbh. It is a religious event that comes once in 12 years and devotees can attend it freely, he had said. However, he later ordered strict compliance with the guidelines issued by the central government in view of the surging positive cases.(With inputs from PTI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-in-a-first-duration-of-haridwar-s-kumbh-mela-curtailed-to-one-month-101616671842219.html

He said that there was no provocation in Tikait’s speech and also called the action “an attempt to silence the voice of farmers.”“The police have booked a case against Bharatiya Kisan Union leader Rakesh Tikait in Shivamogga (Shimoga) and Haveri on the charges of delivering provocative speech. This is nothing but an attempt to silence the voice of farmers,” the former CM tweeted.Also read | Karnataka police book Tikait for ‘lay siege to Bengaluru’ callTwo cases, in Shimoga and Haveri in Karnataka, have been registered against Tikait after his speech earlier on March 20 in Shimoga, where he called the farmers of Karnataka to protest against the farm laws. “You need to make a 'Delhi' in Bengaluru. You need to gherao Bengaluru (like Delhi) from all sides and people will come and join your protest,” news agency ANI quoted Tikait as saying.Kumaraswamy defended these remarks saying that there was nothing provocative in the speech. “There is no provocative element in Tikait’s statement- Farmers need not come to Delhi for the struggle against new farm laws. You can launch a struggle here itself like the one in Delhi”. In fact, it is 'faulty grasping' if someone feels that his statement is provocative,” he tweeted. “If they really wanted to book cases against those indulging in provocative speeches, how many cases should have been booked against BJP leaders by now?” Kumaraswamy further asked.Watch | ‘Farmers will sell their produce in the Parliament…’: Rakesh Tikait﻿He also called for the withdrawal of the two cases by Karnataka police against Tikait. “It is well within the rights granted by the Constitution to take up struggles and to give a call for struggle.

25-03-2021||India||How Delhi’s abstention on Sri Lanka vote in Geneva is playing out in Chennai||In Mannar, the northern province of Sri Lanka, during the civil war, three children woke up on most mornings to dead bodies near their homes and schools. When they were outdoors, and between their school and home, a four-kilometre walk, their father taught them to run to the nearest shelter if they heard distant sounds of aerial bombs or shelling. The bombings took place so often that even the sound of a coconut breaking would send the children running in fear.“...they [the children] were traumatised, so I decided to come to India,” said the father, who wished to remain anonymous because of the fear of reprisal for his family back home. His siblings and extended family stayed back in Sri Lanka.For families like his, the 47-member United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC)’s resolution on Sri Lanka is an important step towards justice. On March 23, UNHRC adopted the resolution for promoting reconciliation, accountability, and human rights in Sri Lanka with 22 of its members voting in favour. India abstained, generating concerns among the Sri Lankan Tamils in India. “Our tears and scars are still fresh... We are at peace now in India but how do we find closure for what happened to us if India takes a neutral position?” the 68-year-old father asked.Also Watch | India abstains from vote on Sri Lanka at UNHRC over civil war crimesAfter living in a transitory camp for four years in Mandapam, his family was shifted to a refugee camp. His four sisters and three brothers stayed back. During the end of the war in 2009, his oldest brother and his children died when they were hiding in a trench. Colloquially called bunkers, these were the safest options to minimise injuries when there was shelling. But death was certain if a bomb landed inside the trench.In Tamil Nadu, successive governments have provided education quota and other benefits for Sri Lankan Tamils. The three children, scarred by war during their childhood, now have a possibly secure future. One is studying for an MBA degree in a London university while two are employed in the state.But to ensure justice for Sri Lankan Tamils, both domestic and international pressure is crucial, say activists. “There is value in the UNHRC process because there is an international spotlight on the issues, so we know there is fairness among the global community on this issue and it is not forgotten,” said Sri Lankan-born social worker Poongkothai Chandrahasan, who has been working with refugees for 17 years in Tamil Nadu.It is voices like these from the ground and the sympathy and solidarity that they evoke among the wider population of the state that has generated pressure on political parties in Tamil Nadu. India’s abstention has embarrassed the ruling All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK). It is being held accountable as it in alliance with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Tamil Nadu, which goes to polls on April 6.Both AIADMK and Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) have promised benefits for Sri Lankan refugees in their election manifesto such as dual citizenship and voting rights. “We know the local parties support our rights and we are aware there may be no immediate solution,” said the father. His generation of refugees wants to return home. “It is our motherland after all,” he said. “But we will advocate for our right to vote and make it a reality before we return.”Also Read | India’s Sri Lanka dilemma | HT EditorialWhile it is not a major electoral poll plank, the issue is sensitive in Tamil Nadu. Some regional parties such as S Seeman’s Tamil nationalist party Naam Tamizhar Katchi (NTK) and Vaiko’s Marumalarchi Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (MDMK) have grown solely maintaining the Sri Lankan Tamils issue as their core ideology. Several Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) leaders, including its chief Vellupuli Prabhakaran, were associated with Dravidian leaders. When they came to the state, they often lived with Tamil families who supported their struggle.Both AIADMK and BJP have said that India’s vote in Geneva would not affect their alliance, but the regional ally has come down heavily on its national partner. AIADMK leaders say that they are ideologically different from the BJP and the alliance is only aimed to defeat the DMK. “This is not the first time that the BJP is making us answerable to criticism just before elections,” said an AIADMK leader, who wished to remain anonymous. “Before the Vellore by-poll, they passed the legislation against triple talaq and our candidate AC Shanmugam lost all the Muslim votes and the seat. On the Sri Lankan issue, however, our electoral prospects would not be impacted as the people who vote based on this issue will anyway choose NTK.”MDMK is with the DMK and Vaiko, who was close to Prabhakaran. It has condemned the Central government for its stand on the vote. DMK president MK Stalin said if there were no elections, the BJP would have voted in favour of Sri Lanka and called abstaining a “great betrayal.” Before the voting, Stalin and AIADMK’s ally, PMK, had urged the Centre to vote against Sri Lanka.The BJP justified its stand, listing Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led government’s schemes and funds for Lankan Tamils. “Though we have abstained, we have issued a strong statement in favour of Sri Lankan Tamils,” said BJP leader CT Ravi. “This is not a political issue but a humanitarian issue between two countries.” Modi had earlier said that the Centre would support the equality and dignity of Sri Lankan Tamils at a public meeting in Chennai in February. “It is like lip-service,” reacted AIADMK’s senior leader C Ponnaiyan.After the three-decade-long war ended in 2009, there have been seven resolutions on Sri Lanka in UNHRC. India’s position has varied. Ahead of the vote in March 2013, the DMK pulled out of the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance, which was in power at the Centre. DMK said the Congress did not do enough to address the alleged human rights violations of Tamils.“The BJP is not bothered about the AIADMK’s position on the issue,” said political analyst Ravindran Duraisamy. “It is not an election issue though it would be spoken about during campaigning and only NTK may get voters on this issue.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/how-delhi-s-abstention-on-sri-lanka-vote-in-geneva-is-playing-out-in-chennai-101616672303412.html

Owing to some financial reasons, he was forced to drop out of school."Faced with financial distress, I dropped out of school in the eighth standard. Then, I went on to work in a couple of IT companies. I have been fond of computers since childhood. I honed my skills and gained knowledge about graphics while working in these companies," Asif said."After working for some time, I started a small set up around graphic designing at home itself. Later, I got a call from one of my mentors who advised me to upgrade my skills to web designing as I was quite good at graphics," Asif added.He said that his 'Thames Infotech' journey started in 2016. Having observed my work in graphic designing, some people contacted him. One of them told him to upgrade to website designing as he was already quite good at graphics. Then, he worked in a UK-based company as an employee and kept learning about websites."I met a man who was a Google-employee, called Hamja Salim. He said we should start a small set-up dealing in website designing. We started our start-up in June 2016. We shifted its headquarters to Manchester in 2018. The start-up was not called 'Thames Infotech' at the start. I took this name from the famous river in London," Asif further added.He returned to Kashmir in 2018 following his wish to create IT awareness in my region."Here we just have one IT professional for every 100 doctors. People think there is no scope in IT. But there is a lot of scope in it. I am giving lessons and teaching the youth here about website and graphics designing now. I don't want my region to fall behind in this particular field," he said.Zubair Ahmad, one of his friends, told ANI that Asif has always been a laborious and talented boy."He struggled a lot in life but I know him as a determined guy from the beginning," Ahamd said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/education/board-exams/school-dropout-creating-it-awareness-among-kashmiri-youth-101616671961788.html

The explosive-laden SUV which was found in front of Ambani house Antilia on February 25 belonged to Hiran, but was stolen a week before the incident. After he was found dead on March 5, Hiran's wife claimed that the car was with Vaze in November last year. She also claimed that Vaze was pressurising Hiran to get arrested in the case.Also Read | Modi insecure about Kejriwal, BJP wants NCT Bill to stem his popularity: SisodiaOn Thursday, as Vaze was produced before the court, he said he had been made a scapegoat in the entire episode. "I have been made a scapegoat in this entire incident and have nothing to do with the crime," he said."I was Investigating officer for one and half day and I did what required to investigate in the case and not only me, all crime branch officers and Mumbai police did," said Vaze before the court.As he is fully co-operating with the probe, Vaze said his custody should not be extended.Vaze told he wanted to share the details of what happened after he went to NIA as he was called for interrogation on March 13. The magistrate asked Vaze to speak with his lawyer and after his discussion with his lawyer Abad Ponda, Vaze said he would give to the court in writing.Vaze was arrested by the NIA for his alleged role in the Antilia bomb scare under section 286, 465, 473, 506(2), 120 B of the Indian Penal Code, and 4(a)(b)(I) of the Explosive Substances Act 1908.The Bharatiya Janata Party leader Devendra Fadnavis earlier said that Sachin Vaze case will not be over until the killer of Mansukh Hiran is revealed.

She has been granted bail upon furnishing a surety of ₹15,000 and a cash surety of ₹20,000, Bar and Bench reported.On March 1, the court ordered a bailable warrant against the actor as she failed to respond to the summons issued by the court."For willful absence of accused (Ranaut) without any justified reasons, despite service of summons, issue bailable warrant of ₹1,000 against accused Kangana Ranaut," Magistrate R R Khan said in the order."As accused (Ranaut) has voluntarily remained absent without any justified reason despite service of summons and even not filed any exemption application, therefore, as per law issuance of bailable warrant of ₹1,000 against accused will be justified," it added.The case pertains to a television interview that Kangana gave on July 19, 2020, and linked Javed Akhtar with Bollywood actor Sushant Singh Rajput's death. Akhtar filed a criminal complaint against Kangana on November 3, under Sections 499 (defamation) and 500 (punishment for defamation) of the Indian Penal Code.On Thursday, she appeared before the court following which the court granted bail. In a parallel development, the Karnataka high court on Thursday set aside an FIR registered against Kangana Ranaut over her tweets where she compared protesting farmers with terrorists.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kangana-ranaut-gets-partial-relief-in-defamation-case-filed-by-javed-akhtar-101616669929794.html
25-03-2021||India||In Assam and Bengal, the BJP’s contrasting approach to CAA-NRC||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)’s dilemma regarding the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC) in election-bound West Bengal and Assam became obvious on Tuesday when the party released its manifesto for the Assam elections.The party’s national president JP Nadda, while releasing the poll manifesto in Assam, said CAA cannot be changed through a state legislation and did not commit to its implementation, two days after home minister Amit Shah, while releasing the manifesto for West Bengal, said the state Cabinet would take a decision on implementing CAA if the BJP comes to power in the state.The BJP’s manifesto in Assam is silent on implementing CAA, which allows citizenship to Hindus, Christians, Buddhists, Parsis and Jains who came to India from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan. Interestingly, before the 2016 elections in the state, which it won, the party promised implementation of CAA, which in the state would have meant automatic citizenship to minorities from Bangladesh, who came after the 1971 war of liberation, without going through the tedious NRC process.Also Read | BJP promises corrected NRC to protect ‘genuine’ Indian citizensIn 2019, the Parliament approved a bill to amend the Citizenship Act, 1955, providing automatic citizenship for non-Muslim minorities from some neighbouring countries who came to India before December 31, 2014. The Assam Accord provides citizenship to migrants after March 25, 1971 as the cut-off date. The difference in the time frame has caused consternation in a state where fear of outsiders resulted in a seven-year-long agitation. The Centre is yet to notify the rules to implement the amended law. In March, a Parliamentary committee gave the home ministry another six months to notify the rules.On Monday, at a road show in West Bengal’s Medinipur, Shah said that CAA will be implemented in Bengal. “Once we are in power, the first meeting of our Cabinet will announce the implementation of the Citizenship Amendment Act,” Shah said.Interestingly, the party is silent on implementing NRC in West Bengal, fearing that doing so could impact Hindu migrants from Bangladesh, including Dalit Hindu communities, the Rajbanshis of north Bengal and Matuas of south Bengal. The two constitute about 28% of the state’s population. Both the communities have demanded CAA and opposed NRC.However, in Assam there were widespread and violent agitations in 2019 against CAA . Most people in the state are in support of NRC, though. Assam’s main opposition party, the Congress, has promised that it will not implement CAA in the state if it comes to power. Also Read | Nobody an outsider in Tagore’s Bengal, says PM Modi; invokes national anthemThere is a fear in Assam that CAA would dilute the 1985 Assam Accord and lead to a fresh influx of Bangladeshi Hindus. The accord provided for the deportation of all refugees and migrants, who entered Assam after March 25, 1971. CAA extends the deadline until December 31, 2014.In Assam, the BJP has announced that it will focus on a corrected NRC after a large number of Hindu migrants were left out of the updated NRC announced on August 31, 2019. NRC for the detection of undocumented foreigners excluded 1.9 million of the nearly 33 million people, who applied for inclusion in NRC. The BJP has rejected NRC as “faulty” saying genuine citizens were left out while foreigners were included. The NRC is yet to be notified.Nadda said the party, if elected in Assam, would make efforts to correct the NRC to protect genuine citizens. The NRC was conducted in Assam under the Supreme Court directions in 2017-18. In the budget session of Parliament, the home ministry said that no decision has been taken on implementing the NRC nationally. Tapas Roy, Bengal’s deputy parliamentary affairs minister, said, “The announcement Shah made regarding CAA is nothing but a jumla (false promise). The BJP knows it can never enforce it in Bengal. The same goes with NRC. Shah needs to explain what happened to the 1.2 million Bengalis whose names got delisted in Assam,” he said. Kolkata-based professor of economics and political analyst Sarthak Roychaudhury said, “If Shah is a seasoned and judicious politician then he should first analyse why such large sections of Bengalis, including Hindus, are opposed to CAA and NRC. Both are double-edged weapons and the BJP needs to be careful about them.”Akhil Ranjan Dutta, a columnist and professor of political science at Gauhati University, said, “The BJP is talking only about a corrected NRC, but the 10 commitments (in its manifesto) don’t mention CAA, which the party has committed to implement in West Bengal. In the 2019 general election, CAA was a core issue. But this time they have avoided it and are more focussed on highlighting the so-called clash of civilisations and promise to protect Assam’s ‘sanskriti’ from cultural threat.

25-03-2021||India||Need to increase maximum age limit for recruitment due to Covid pandemic doesn't arise: Centre||The need for increasing the maximum age limit for recruitment to various categories of posts under the central government, due to the Covid-19 pandemic and lockdown in the country, does not arise, the Rajya Sabha was informed on Thursday.“Insofar as the increase in maximum age limit by two years for all the eligible unemployed youths, who are seeking state government jobs is concerned, it is for the concerned state governments to decide,” Minister of State for Personnel Jitendra Singh said in a written reply.The minister was responding to a question whether the government is considering to increase maximum age limit by two years for all the eligible unemployed youths, who are seeking central and state government jobs as they lost their chances due to Covid-19 pandemic and lockdown in the country.For recruitment to central government posts, the recruiting agencies, such as the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC), have been making necessary arrangements for conduct of examinations in a safe manner considering the Covid-19 pandemic safety protocols, Singh said.While conducting civil services (preliminary) examination-2020 on October 4 last year, the UPSC also gave an option to the candidates to change the centre for civil services (preliminary) examination-2020 so that candidates who had moved to a different location before/during the Covid-19 pandemic could also appear in the examination, he said.“As such, the need for increasing the maximum age limit for recruitment to various categories of posts under the central government due to the pandemic and lockdown in the country does not arise,” the minister said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/need-to-increase-maximum-age-limit-for-recruitment-due-to-covid-pandemic-doesn-t-arise-centre-101616669142931.html
25-03-2021||India||Corporate party’s entry makes enough ripples in Kerala’s polity||After its emphatic win in four local bodies in Ernakulam district in December, the corporate party, Twenty20, took a deep plunge in assembly elections, nine years after its formation, increasing heartbeats of mainstream political parties. It has fielded eight candidates for the April 6 elections and claims at least a couple of them will be in the state assembly.There was a long queue before Kitex group of companies, a successful apparel unit and aluminium utensil producer, headquarters in Kizhakkambalam (16 kilometres away from Ernakulam) before elections but the Twenty20 stood its ground.“Our independent character is our success. If we align with any formations we will lose our identity,” said chief co-ordinator of the party Sabu Jacob who is also chairman of the ₹1,000 crore Kitex group.Due to Twenty20’s presence, many constituencies are witnessing a four-cornered contest in Ernakulam, a first for the state. The fledgeling party got a big push last week when V Guard group chairman Kochouspeh Chittilapilly, known for his philanthropic activities, actor Sreenivasan and cine director Siddique (‘Body Guard’ fame) joined it as mentors.“Everyone needs a change and people are looking to us for this. There were many attempts to run us down and during the last local body elections, all parties teamed up and there were attempts on some of our activists. But these attacks failed to intimidate us,” said Jacob, a second-generation businessman who shuttles between India and the United States.In the 2016 local body election, it swept the power in Kizhakkambalam, a tiny panchayat with 38,000 people, but in 2020, it added four more local bodies to its kit.For the politically conscious state, “corporatization of power” was hard to digest but results are plain to see. Houses for the poor (known as God’s villas), free wi-fi, special package for students, subsidised food, better infrastructure, plug and play stations for startups and organic farms form the results that are visible in the semi-agrarian and urban village of Kizhakkambalam. If a visitor mistakes Kizhakkambalam for a slice of a developed country, he can’t be blamed either. The Twenty20 stamp is everywhere.“We consider our village an extended family. People’s need is the need of the village. Once debt-ridden panchayat, now it has a surplus budget worth ₹13.4 crore. There were many attempts to intimidate us and we spent a good amount for litigation also,” Sabu Jacob explained.Recently, many such apolitical outfits like ‘V for Kochi’ and ‘Thiruvananthapuram Development Front’ came forward to align with the new experiment but Twenty20 remained aloof.“It is not a one-day wonder. We need sustainable and committed people to further it. So we are not for any experiment at this juncture,” he said adding that he was forced to float the party in 2012 after being fed up with the mounting corruption around. He said after gauging the success of the assembly poll experiment, he will think of furthering Twenty20’s wings to other parts of the state.“All I want is to correct the system but nobody is willing to involve with it. Many people are there to make running commentaries without involvement. People will have to come forward to correct it,” he explained his guiding principle. He said the country lacks vision and corruption has seeped into every aspect, hindering development and happiness around.“If we can sweep out corruption and work with some vision, I think 80 per cent of our problems will be over,” he said.The people of Kizhakkambalam and many neighbouring villages are happy but politicians are not amused. “If big corporate houses run parties like this what will be the future of our country? People will be happy with some goodies and services but in the long run, it will destroy democracy,” said former MP and CPI(M) leader P Rajeev who is seeking election from Kalamassery. All parties admit the new party is posing a big threat to established players and are keeping their fingers crossed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/corporate-party-s-entry-makes-enough-ripples-in-kerala-polity-101616669303020.html
25-03-2021||India||Amid protest, Odisha Cabinet okays mineral foundation fund for hockey stadium||On Monday, the Odisha Cabinet approved the development of Bhubaneswar’s Kalinga Stadium and construction of an international hockey stadium in Rourkela ahead of Men’s Hockey World Cup in 2023. Of the ₹356.38 crore the project requires, ₹266 crore will come through District Mineral Foundation (DMF) Trust of Sundargarh, and Odisha Sports Development Fund.The decision has renewed the questions that have been raised over the alleged misuse of DMF funds for a various other projects but those for mining-affected public, which was why the DMF was created. For instance, in January last year, Rourkela city police got 25 Innova Crysta vehicles at a cost of ₹4.65 crore with Sundargarh DMF fund.“How would building stadium or buying police vehicles help mining-affected areas? People in Sundargarh don’t have access to safe drinking water and proper roads. Should the funds not be used for better purposes,” asked Laxman Munda, CPM MLA from Bonai in Sundargarh. Munda’s protests have come at a time when the Shivraj Singh Chouhan government in Madhya Pradesh is using the DMF funds for the construction of an airstrip in Singrauli district, one of the biggest and most polluted coal mining and thermal power hubs in the country.  DMF was instituted through an amendment to Mines and Minerals(Development and Regulation) Act 2015 to “work for the interest and benefit of people and areas affected by mining”. The funds of DMF trust come from mining companies operating in the respective districts and they pay an equivalent of 30% of the royalty amount for leases granted before 2015, and 10% for leases granted after that. DMF fund is to be spent on improving human development indicators through investments in high-priority areas such as healthcare, education, women and child development, improving sustainable livelihood, and income opportunities in areas adversely affected by mining.Also Read | Amid protest, Odisha Cabinet okays mineral foundation fund for hockey stadiumTill January this year, Odisha collected ₹11,984.87 crore in its DMF fund, the highest in the country, and spent ₹5,364 crore out of it, around 44.76% , a little less than the national average. Yet, there are murmurs of protest over the alleged misuse of funds.Kusum Tete, BJP MLA of Sundargarh, one of the districts where DMF money is being spent, said, “Rourkela city is not a mining area while most of my electorate bear the brunt of pollution due to coal and iron ore mining. The government is using DMF funds for sports infra in Rourkela, and policing. Should it not have used the money for providing piped water in Sundargarh?” Tete said Hemagir, one of the blocks in her assembly constituency, suffers from pollution from trucks carrying coal to neighbouring Chhatisgarh. “The first priority should have been using the DMF funds to prevent pollution in the area. The tribals have been agitating for the past two months, but the government is the least bothered,” she said.Chinmayi Shalya, who works with the International Forum for Environment, Sustainability and Technology (iForest) on DMF issues, said DMF fund is not meant for stadium construction and beautification projects. “It is a targeted fund for mining-affected communities. Using it singularly for hockey World Cup would potentially be a misuse,” she said.Chief secretary Suresh Mohapatra and Sundargarh district collector Nikhil Pawan Kalyan did not comment on the allegations.Activists are also severely critical of the state government’s decision to use DMF funds for integrated traffic management system to check road fatalities in the state.“The commerce and transport department has asked all districts to install CCTV surveillance system for enforcement of traffic violations at vulnerable stretches and black spots on highways from the DMF or Corporate Social Responsibility fund where DMF is not available. How will CCTV surveillance help the lot of tribals?” asked activist Pradip Pradhan.The state government also plans to construct integrated infrastructure complex, including old age homes in all the 30 districts, with the funding support from DMF. In Keonjhar, locals pointed out the district authorities are building a handball stadium in Keonjhar. “At least 56% of the people in Keonjhar district are Dalits and tribals and sizeable section of them is below the poverty line. Yet the district administration does not take the suggestion of the common people while finalising the plans for DMF use,” alleged Kiran Sahu, president of Keonjhar Citizen’s Forum.Even as there have been protests over the expenditure on stadiums and police vehicles, the Odisha Commerce and Transport department has sought the permission to build a new railway line project for iron ore transportation in Keonjhar district from DMF fund, triggered another controversy.In a letter to the Keonjhar district collector, the department has asked if the DMF trust can sanction ₹363.38 crore for building the 18 km Banspani-Barbil line that will provide direct rail connectivity to iron ore loading stations on the Noamundi-Bolani Khadan section from Banspani for movement to steel plants in Odisha or to ports. The railway line is proposed to be built by Odisha Rail Infrastructure Development Limited, a state government-led joint venture with Indian Railways.Environmentalists and right activists are decidedly against the project. “When DMF fund is supposed to be spent for the benefit of those affected by mining-related operations, seeking permission for spending it on railway project connecting iron ore loading stations to steel plants is a mad idea. The DMF fund is meant to uplift the living standards of mining-affected people, not make their lives more miserable,” said Prafulla Samantara, rights activist who was awarded the Goldman Environmental Prize in 2017.Prominent environmental activist Biswajit Mohanty said it is laughable to propose spending DMF fund for iron ore transportation when miners are asked to contribute to the fund for the damage they are causing to local environment. CPM MLA from Bonai constituency of Sundargarh district, Laxman Munda said, “Lack of transparency can result in wasteful expenditure, misuse of funds and sub-standard quality of work and corruption.” Shalya pointed out that decision-making needs to involve those directly affected by mining. “There are some good investment examples from Odisha, such as, the use of DMF to increase MGNREGA wages at par with state minimum wage in Keonjhar. States should guide and equip districts for a long-term planning of DMFs so that funds are used wisely and effectively to improve the well-being of local communities,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amid-protest-odisha-cabinet-okays-mineral-foundation-fund-for-hockey-stadium-101616668823177.html

I have challenged in the Delhi High Court the constitutional vires of Section 50 of the PMLA (Prevention of Money Laundering Act), under which these summons are issued," she said in a letter to the ED.Section 50 of the PMLA empowers the authority, that is, officers of the ED, to summon any person to give evidence or produce records. People who are summoned are bound to answer the questions put to them and to produce documents as required by the ED officers, failing which they can be penalised under the PMLA.The PDP leader had said that without prejudice to any of the contentions in the proceedings before the high court, "I state that I am not in a position to attend the summon on March 22 as I have prior commitments that cannot be cancelled at such short notice"."If however you insist we must do it sooner, I am ready and willing to be questioned in Srinagar, preferably at my residence or through video conference from Srinagar," Mehbooba said in her letter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mehbooba-mufti-appears-before-ed-in-srinagar-101616668132512.html
25-03-2021||India||Domestic violence complaints against women spiked in year of lockdown: NCW data||The number of complaints of domestic violence received by the National Commission for Women rose sharply from 2,960 in 2019 to 5,297 in 2020, the year of the lockdown when most people were confined to their homes due to Covid-19. The trend continues this year as well.The NCW received a total of 19,730 complaints of crimes against women in 2019 as compared to 23,722 in 2020, according to official data.A year after the lockdown, the NCW continues to receive over 2,000 complaints every month of crimes against women with nearly one-fourth of them related to domestic violence, it stated. According to the NCW data, 1,463 complaints of domestic violence against women were received from January, 2021 to March 25, 2021.The nationwide lockdown was imposed on March 25 last year to curb the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic, but it also trapped many domestic violence victims with their abusers.Soon after the lockdown was imposed, the NCW reported a surge of complaints related to domestic violence so much so that it started a dedicated WhatsApp number for reporting of just domestic violence complaints.The number of complaints of domestic violence went on increasing through the months and in July, a record number of 660 such complaints were received.Since June, the NCW has been receiving over 2,000 complaints of crimes against women every month out of which nearly a quarter are of domestic violence, the data stated.According to the NCW data, 25,886 complaints of crime against women have been received from April, 2020 till now which includes 5,865 complaints of domestic violence. Also, the NCW received the highest number of complaints against women in six years in 2020 at 23,722 with nearly one-fourth of them of domestic violence.NCW chairperson Rekha Sharma had said economic insecurity, increased stress levels, anxiety, financial worry, and lack of other such emotional support of parents/family's side may have resulted in domestic violence in many instances in the year 2020."More so, home has become the workplace of both the spouses and as well as schools and colleges for their children. In such situations, women are multitasking being professional at the same time supporting their families from the same space. But the biggest challenge for women this year is not only to adapt but to thrive in this unprecedented situation," she had told PTI.Women rights activist Yogita Bhayana, who heads the People Against Rape in India (PARI), said the high rate might also be because of high awareness among women to talk about it and report it."There has been an increase because there is also a rise in awareness because women are getting more proactive reporting it and talking about it. Earlier they used to suppress their grievances and the government is also spreading awareness and women get motivated by other women reporting it," she said."Because of social media, the reporting of domestic violence has increased. Women have become more vocal and they have less tolerance, which is very good," she noted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/domestic-violence-complaints-against-women-spiked-in-year-of-lockdown-ncw-data-101616665002984.html

25-03-2021||India||RBI governor says surging cases a concern, but lockdown unlikely||Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Shaktikanta Das said on Wednesday that while the resurgence of coronavirus infections in the country was a matter of concern, the chances of there being a lockdown like the one last year was unlikely."The renewed surge in Covid-19 cases in the country matter of concern, but we have additional insurances this time to tackle the afflictions," he said at the India Economic Conclave (IEC) 2021 at Delhi. "At this point in time, one does not foresee the kind of lockdown experienced last year."This comes as state governments like Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Gujarat and Punjab are imposing curbs to check the spread of the virus in their respective states.Maharashtra is the state that has been recording the highest number of coronavirus infections in the country for quite a while now and the state government has been forced to impose stringent restrictions in cities like Nagpur and Pune.

25-03-2021||India||Chhattisgarh bars Holi Milan events in Raipur, quarantine must for outsiders||Chhattisgarh, one of the five states powering the surge of Covid-19 cases, has announced restrictions on entry of people to tourist spots and banned social, political and religious programmes in state capital Raipur, an official statement by the government said on Thursday.The new set of guidelines issued by the Raipur district administration also mandates that people entering the capital from other states would have to spend seven days in home quarantine before they can step out.An official said according to the guidelines, Holi Milan celebrations or other public gatherings have been banned, although ‘Holika Dahan’, a religious ritual associated with the festival, has been allowed to take place on the condition that a maximum of only five people are present.Thursday’s restrictions in Raipur comes after a spike in Covid-19 cases in the state. According to data compiled by the Union health ministry, Chhattisgarh reported 1,443 cases in the last 24 hours, next only to Maharashtra’s 16,600 fresh cases. On Sunday, Chhattisgarh ordered all educational institutions and anganwadis to remain closed till further notice.India recorded 53,476 new Covid-19 cases, 26,490 recoveries, and 251 deaths in the last 24 hours.

These five states account for 77% of the total cases in the country.The Union home ministry earlier this week gave states a free hand to introduce restrictions on people to deal with the pandemic, allowing state governments to impose their local restrictions such as night curfew or weekend restrictions in the district, sub-district or city level based on the situation. States are, however, not allowed to stop inter-state and intra-state movement.“All kinds of religious festivals, cultural and political programmes, sports, exhibitions and fairs, functions and public programmes have been banned. Religious places will remain open for only paying obeisance at personal level and people can enter places of worship individually, but organising any kind of group or public programmes will be prohibited there,” the Chhattisgarh government’s statement said.Programmes such as marriage, funeral, etc will be allowed with the maximum presence of 50 persons, and adherence to Covid-19 guidelines, such as wearing masks and social distancing will be mandatory.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chhattisgarh-bars-holi-milan-events-in-raipur-quarantine-must-for-outsiders-101616660662283.html

He was reacting to the passage of the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi (Amendment) Bill, 2021, (GNCTD bill) in the Rajya Sabha."They (BJP) want to run the government through the LG. Then, what's the need for an elected government?" Kharge was quoted by news agency ANI as saying. "We had forced them to send the bill to the select committee but they didn't agree, then, opposition walked out of the House," he further said.On Wednesday, the upper house of Parliament gave a nod to the contentious Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi (Amendment) Bill, amid massive uproar and opposition walkout. The bill has already been passed by the lower house of the Parliament, Lok Sabha.The bill seeks to give overarching powers over Delhi’s daily functions to the L-G who is appointed by the central government. If enacted, a reference to the word 'government' in any law passed by the legislative assembly would directly mean the L-G and not the state government. It also makes it mandatory for the city government to seek L-G’s opinion before any executive action.Since it was tabled in Parliament, there has been major protests by the ruling Aam Aadmi Party (AAP government. The bill has also revived an old-running power tussle between the Centre and the Delhi government over the control of the national capital.On Wednesday, Delhi chief minister and AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal called it a "Sad Day" for the Indian democracy and asserted that the party will continue its struggle to "restore power back to people". " Whatever be the obstacles, we will continue doing good work.

Athawale said that he demanded President’s rule to be imposed in the state amid corruption allegations against the home minister Anil Deshmukh, reported news agency ANI.“...gave him (President Kovind) a memorandum on behalf of RPI (A) party demanding the President's rule in Maharashtra. It is a serious matter. No inquiry can take place until the Maharashtra government is removed. He said that he will consider it,” he told ANI.Watch | Ramdas Athawale meets Kovind, seeks President's rule in MaharashtraAthawale's meeting comes in the backdrop of extortion allegations against Deshmukh levelled by former Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh, who was recently removed from his post. In a letter to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, Singh stated that the home minister tasked now suspended police officer Sachin Vaze with collecting ₹100 crore a month from restaurants and bars in Mumbai. Vaze has been arrested in cases related to bomb scare at billionaire industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s residence last month.The minister, however, has denied the allegations saying he was admitted to a hospital in Nagpur after testing positive for Covid-19 and then home quarantining at his Mumbai bungalow in February, when according to the cop’s letter he met Vaze.As opposition leaders continued to mount pressure on the government, Deshmukh on Wednesday wrote to chief minister Thackeray seeking an investigation into the corruption charges levelled against him by Singh. "If the chief minister inquires the matter, I would welcome it. Satyamev Jayate," he wrote on Twitter and posted the copy of the letter he sent.The top cop on the other hand has approached the Supreme Court demanding a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) probe against Deshmukh. The apex court directed him to the high court saying the latter was a more appropriate forum for deciding on the issue. Following this, the former Mumbai Police chief withdrew his petition.NCP leaders including the party’s national chief Sharad Pawar have backed Deshmukh. The former chief minister and BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis, however, has continued to raise his voice alleging that this is not the first time corruption charges have been made against the state home minister. He has repeatedly demanded Deshmukh’s resignation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/minister-demands-president-s-rule-in-maharashtra-amid-corruption-claim-against-anil-deshmukh-101616655079915.html

The court also asked Deepak Kochhar to surrender passport with authorities and co-operate with the probe in the loan case.A special court had rejected his bail plea in November, 2020. He was arrested in September last year. Both Chanda and Deepak Kochhar are being investigated by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and Enforcement Directorate (ED) for alleged corruption and money laundering. Both of them have been questioned by the ED multiple times.The probe revolves around alleged irregularities in the granting of loans to the Videocon Group.It started after a whistle-blower complaint alleged that Venugopal Dhoot of Videocon invested in a company along with Deepak Kochhar and then transferred his holdings to the latter. The complaint linked this to loans issued by the bank to Videocon.ICICI bank’s board initially backed Chanda Kochhar. However, she stepped down on October 4, 2018. The bank’s board sacked her in January 2019, treating her exit as termination.Kochhar defended herself before ED in March 2019 saying the loans were given on merit and have no link with her husband’s business.The ED is probing 24 loans aggregating ₹7,862 crore during Chanda Kochhar’s tenure as the CEO and Managing Director of ICICI Bank. Out of this, ₹1,875 crore loan disbursed by ICICI Bank to Venugopal Dhoot-led Videocon Group in 2009 and 2011.A special PMLA (Prevention Of Money Laundering Act) court granted her bail in February in the loan case. She was asked to furnish a bond of ₹5 lakh and not leave the country without the permission of the court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/deepak-kochhar-husband-of-chanda-kochhar-gets-bail-in-loan-case-101616656032851.html

The court passed the order while hearing a plea from women Army officers who were rejected for permanent commission."We allow these petitions with a number of directions. Officers will be considered for permanent commission subject to disciplinary and vigilance clearance," the bench headed by Justice Dr D Y Chandrachud said."This shall continue and they shall avail all benefits," it further said, disposing off the writ petition.The court also made strong observations about the Army's evaluation criteria to grant permanent commission to officers, calling it "arbitrary and irrational"."The evaluation criteria adopted by Army constitutes systemic discrimination of women... The criteria requiring them to match the lowest merit of the male officer and requirement to be in SHAPE-1 criteria disproportionately affects women," the bench said."A career in the army comes with many trials. It becomes more difficult when the society puts responsibility of childcare and domestic work on women," the bench said. It, however, added that there can be no judicial review of standards adopted by the Army.In their petition, the women officers claimed that 615 women officers of the Short Service Commission (SSC) were eligible for PC, but only 277 made it to the final list.The court asked the Army to consider the candidature of these women officers within a month in accordance with the directions issued by the court.The top court earlier ordered that the permanent commission will apply to all women officers in the Indian Army in service, irrespective of their years of service. It also ordered that after the judgement of Delhi high court, Centre should grant permanent commission to women officers.Last year, the court ordered the central government to grant permanent commission to women officers in the Army's non-combat support units on par with their male counterparts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-allows-permanent-commission-to-women-officers-101616651773531.html
25-03-2021||India||India will finally have a say in crucial meetings to decide Afghan future||After months of watching from the sidelines as the Trump administration recklessly pushed ahead with a deal with the Taliban, the Indian government will finally have a say in two crucial meetings being held to decide the future of Afghanistan.On March 30, external affairs minister S Jaishankar is set to join a meeting of the Heart of Asia-Istanbul Process in the Tajikistan capital of Dushanbe. Sometime after that, India is expected to join Russia, China, Pakistan, Iran, and the US for a meeting to be convened by the UN to discuss a unified approach on Afghanistan.Both meetings will be crucial opportunities for the Indian foreign policy set-up to present its expectations of the end state that the US appears intent on pushing through in Kabul in order to end its involvement in a war that has dragged on for two decades and bring all its troops home.Also Read | India, Afghanistan to share experience, expertise in public service recruitmentThe meetings are also relevant because India has had virtually no say regarding the negotiations between the US and the Taliban since the signing of a so-called peace deal last year and no role in the “extended troika” meeting on Afghanistan that was convened by Russia on March 18.As the Trump administration pushed ahead with its talks with the Taliban, India had to be content with watching from the margins while carrying on with its vast development portfolio – with pledges of $3 billion, India is the largest regional investor in Afghanistan’s future – and making repeated calls that the peace process must be Afghan-led, Afghan-owned and Afghan-controlled, and that any solution must also address New Delhi’s security concerns.However, even the strongest opponents of the Taliban are now veering around to the conclusion that any future dispensation that emerges in Kabul, thanks to the latest push by the Biden administration, will have to include the militant group that is viewed with deep suspicion in New Delhi because of its deep-rooted links with the military establishment in Rawalpindi.Insiders in Kabul say US secretary of state Antony Blinken resorted to the step of writing a letter to President Ashraf Ghani last month, outlining American plans for the new push for a political settlement, after conveying messages on five separate occasions regarding the need for the government in Kabul to act with more alacrity. This included two phone calls from Blinken to Ghani in January and February, but the insiders say these contacts didn’t elicit the response desired by the Afghans.There is also a feeling in some quarters in Kabul that New Delhi is uniquely placed, because of its influence with Ghani, to persuade the Afghan president to consider the American proposal – which includes a draft peace agreement that envisages a “transitional peace government”.So far, Ghani has shown little inclination to accept this American proposal. Afghan foreign minister Haneef Atmar said during his visit to India this week that any interim set-up would be a departure from the Constitution. He also said Ghani is ready to hold early presidential elections if the Taliban agree that elections are the only legitimate way to transfer power.Also Read | India, Afghanistan ink deal for new dam, PM Modi calls for immediate ceasefireBut insiders in Kabul note that Ghani’s shrinking popularity among the public could ultimately limit his role in the process that is currently being pushed by the US, and the Indian side could nudge him to play a more proactive role in shaping the end state.The most-tricky issues for India, however, remain forging closer links with all political players in Afghanistan and the question of opening a channel with the Taliban. The US special representative for Afghanistan reconciliation, Zalmay Khalilzad, argued last year that India should initiate a dialogue with the Taliban as it would help New Delhi to directly take up its terrorism-related concerns with the militant group.Though there was a nascent debate within Indian decision-making circles some time ago on whether to open a channel with the Taliban, this was set aside at the time of the 2019 general election because of concerns about New Delhi potentially engaging the Taliban leading to questions about the lack of a similar approach with the Kashmiris.Though the Biden administration might ultimately relent on its May 1 deadline for withdrawing all American troops from Afghanistan, thereby addressing some of the immediate security concerns of New Delhi about such a drastic drawdown energising India’s adversaries in Afghanistan, it is becoming increasingly clear that India will have to make some hard choices if it wants to have a seat among the players who will shape Afghanistan’s future.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-will-finally-have-a-say-in-crucial-meetings-to-decide-afghan-future-101616650221948.html

This is the highest daily spike since October 23 last year when 54,366 fresh cases were recorded.The nation’s infection tally has soared past 11.78 million. The fatality count, which has been rising over the last few weeks, has gone up to 160,692.Following the grim figures since the last few weeks, the central government on Tuesday decided to open vaccination for everyone above 45 years of age from April 1.Adding to the worries, a novel variant of the Sars-Cov-2 has been detected in seven states, and especially in high numbers in Maharashtra, the health ministry said on Wednesday. The emergence of the new variant partially explains the surge in cases, experts said. Officials, however, have said that it may be too soon to arrive at a conclusion.Follow latest updates on Covid-19 here The variant carries mutations that include those denoted by the letters E484Q and L452R, which have separately been linked to making the virus spread more readily and defeat, to some extent, immunity from a vaccine or past infection.“The analysis of samples from Maharashtra has revealed that compared to December 2020, there has been an increase in the fraction of samples with the E484Q and L452R mutations. Such mutations confer immune escape and increased infectivity. These mutations have been found in about 15-20% of samples and do not match any previously catalogued VOCs (variants of concerns),” the health ministry said in statment on Wednesday.The director of the National Centre for Disease Control, Dr Sujeet Kumar said though 206 samples from Maharashtra had the new variant, “ data does not allow for us to make a direct correlation yet for the rise in cases.”“Though VOCs and a new double mutant variant have been found in India, these have not been detected in numbers sufficient to either establish or direct relationship or explain the rapid increase in cases in some states. Genomic sequencing and epidemiological studies are continuing to further analyze the situation,” the government said.Other experts, however, have said that the possibility of a correlation is very high.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-logs-53-476-fresh-covid-19-cases-highest-daily-spike-in-5-months-101616645356869.html
25-03-2021||India||3 Rafale fighters landing next week, 9 more in April to add to IAF’s firepower||The Indian Air Force (IAF) is set to acquire more teeth with three more Rafale omni-role fighters on their way to Ambala early next week with another nine slated to land by mid-April from France. The Hasimara forward base in north Bengal will start operations with five fighters next month, people aware of the matter said.According to French and Indian diplomats, an IAF team has already reached Merignac airbase in Bordeaux to finalise the date for ferrying three Rafales to Ambala. The expected date is either March 30 or 31 with the fighters to be refuelled mid-air by French refuellers as per availability with a stop-over at Al Dhafra airbase in the UAE.India ordered 36 planes from France (the equivalent of two squadrons with 18 jets each) in September 2016 for ₹59,000 crore under a government-to-government deal. The IAF’s Ambala-based Golden Arrows Squadron has already inducted 11 Rafale jets between July 2020 and January 2021. These fighter jets have been operated in the Ladakh theatre where the military is on high alert amid a border standoff with China since early May 2020.Dassault Aviation has already handed over seven more fighters to the IAF for training in France and will deliver the remaining six Rafale jets after April to complete the delivery of 36 aircraft by end of this year.The aircraft carries a range of potent weapon systems including long-range Meteor missiles, HAMMER smart munition and SCALP cruise missile. The beyond visual range air-to-air Meteor missile is considered a game-changer by defence experts with undisclosed range well beyond 100 kilometres.Diplomats cited above said there was a remote possibility that IAF chief Air Chief Marshal RKS Bhadauria, who will be on a bilateral visit to France around April 20-22, could flag off the nine fighters from Merignac airbase.The arrival of nine Rafales in April will complete the Ambala squadron with 18 aircraft. The second squadron at Hasimara forward base will be raised with five fighters. Although Hasimara is a front-line airbase for the fourth-generation-plus fighters in the eastern sector to keep a close eye on Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh borders with China, the fighters will be deployed all over the country, particularly north Assam.Air force officials said after the induction of Rafales in Hasimara, India’s eastern flank will enhance the strategic capability of the IAF with a C-130J Hercules squadron based at West Bengal’s Panagarh.National security planners are also pushing for the upgrade of Indian airbases in the eastern sector with more blast pens and surface-to-air missile cover given the rapid upgrade of Chinese infrastructure and military airbases all along the Line of Actual Control. An influential section within the military believes that IAF’s eastern air command, currently headquartered in salubrious climes of Shillong in Meghalaya, should be shifted closer to north Assam for rapid response.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/3-rafale-fighters-landing-next-week-9-more-in-april-to-add-to-iaf-s-firepower-101616645122653.html

Here is all you need to know about the detection and why it in part explains a surge in cases even as officials said it may be too soon to draw conclusions:• The variant carries mutations that include those denoted by E484Q and L452R, which have separately been linked to characteristics that make the virus spread more readily and defeat, to some extent, immunity from a vaccine or past infection.• Two of these, E484Q and L452R, have been seen as a combination in a variant the government described as “double mutant”.• It was found in a large number of samples, 206, in Maharashtra, which is in the grip of its worst wave of infections yet.• “These mutations have been found in about 15-20% of samples and do not match any previously catalogued VOCs [variants of concern],” the Union health ministry said in a statement.• Sujeet Kumar, the director of the National Centre for Disease Control, said that while 206 samples from Maharashtra had the new variant, “data does not allow for us to make a direct correlation yet for the rise in cases.”• But other experts said the likelihood of a correlation is very high.• “If 20% of samples in states like Maharashtra have shown mutant variants, it is very likely that the surge in Covid-19 cases is being driven by these mutations,” said Dr Gagandeep Kang, one of India’s top vaccinologists.Also Read | Maharashtra, Mumbai see a record 31,855 and 5,190 new Covid-19 cases• The government also confirmed the discovery of a large number of people with the UK variant (B.1.1.7) in Punjab (336 cases) and in the case of this variant too.• Delhi recorded the second-highest number of samples with this variant at 75.• The UK variant is one of three VOCs.• The other two were first seen in South Africa (B.1.351) and Brazil (P.1).• In all, 771 samples from 18 states have turned up positive for these VOCs.• Experts said the situation must now be closely watched, particularly in states where a large number of samples have the novel variant or the variants of concern.• On Wednesday, Maharashtra accounted for 60% of the 53,410 daily new cases in the country and Punjab 5% although cases here have risen sharply from a low base.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/double-mutant-variant-of-sars-cov-2-detected-in-india-what-it-could-mean-101616644581280.html

Here is all you need to know about the submission:• It came during the court’s hearing of a plea moved by the NGO Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR) seeking stay on sale of electoral bonds from April 1 to 10 ahead of the assembly elections in West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Assam, and Union Territory of Puducherry.• Senior advocate Rakesh Dwivedi appearing for EC said the Commission is supporting electoral bonds and not opposing it.• The EC said it is also asking for transparency, which the court can consider later.Also Read | TMC calls on EC to create ‘level-playing field’ in West Bengal• Electoral bonds promise anonymity, with only the issuing bank, the state-owned State Bank of India being aware of the identity of the purchaser.• They were notified by the government in January 2018 and were first issued in March 2018.• A three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde recorded the submission of EC and reserved orders on the application filed by ADR.• While doing so, the Court raised an apprehension of possible misuse of these bonds and the mechanism available with the Centre to remedy the situation.• This was not the main objection of the petitioner, who was objecting to the very use of the bonds, not their misuse.• Attorney General KK Venugopal appearing for Centre referred to certain checks and balances.• He said that parties are required to file their income tax returns each year showing how they have expended the money.• A political party can face deregistration if it is found to indulge in anti-national or illegal activities.• Venugopal said the use of bonds is essential for the country as it has curbed black money used in elections.• For the petitioner, advocate Prashant Bhushan submitted that there was complete anonymity about who purchases these bonds and to whom they are subsequently transferred.• He read out an earlier affidavit filed by EC in March 2019 where it raised concerns over a lack of transparency in tracking political party donations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ec-supports-electoral-bonds-seeks-transparency-what-its-submission-to-sc-says-101616642421301.html
25-03-2021||India||Rain, thunderstorm likely over central India today, says IMD||Widespread rain and thunderstorm activity is likely over central and west India today followed by rain and thunderstorms over the western Himalayan region, according to India Meteorological Department (IMD).A cyclonic circulation is lying over Madhya Maharashtra and its neighbourhood and there is another cyclonic circulation over southeast Madhya Pradesh. Under their influence, isolated rainfall with thunderstorm and lightning is likely over east Madhya Pradesh, Vidarbha, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Maharashtra , Marathwada, Konkan and Goa today. Also Read | MP, UP sign Ken-Betwa pact: Here’s why it alarmed environmentalistsA fresh Western Disturbance is likely to affect the western Himalayan region from March 27. Under its influence, scattered to fairly widespread rainfall or snowfall with thunderstorm and lightning is likely over Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand and thunderstorm, lightning, hail and gusty winds are likely over Jammu, Kashmir, Ladakh, Gilgit, Baltistan and Muzaffarabad. The maximum temperatures are likely to rise by 4-6 degrees Celsius (°C) over northwest India and by 3-4°C over west India after 48 hours.Meanwhile, the cooling effect of La Niña, a global weather pattern, has started waning, according to the IMD, which said that it may completely turn neutral during April, resulting in a harsh summer.La Niña is associated with the cooling of Pacific waters. A La Niña year generally receives good rainfall and temperatures are lower than normal.“La Niña is often associated with lower temperatures in India. But that is now unlikely during the rest of the summer and monsoon months. But the actual weather conditions will depend on local synoptic features. For example, the interaction of westerlies and easterlies over central India is currently causing thunderstorm activity and temperatures have dropped. But overall, we can say La Niña will phase out gradually,” said DS Pai, senior climate scientist at IMD.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rain-thunder-likely-over-central-india-todayimd-101616641041173.html
25-03-2021||India||Supreme Court to hear petition seeking to stop deportation of Rohingya refugees||The Supreme Court will on Thursday hear a petition seeking release and protection of over 150 Rohingya refugees in Jammu and Kashmir. The union territory's administration has said it will work on their deportation to Myanmar.The petition will be heard by a bench headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde. Last week, the bench asked solicitor general Tushar Mehta to come with a response to the plea.The intervention application has been filed by Mohammad Salimullah, a Rohingya refugee, through advocate Prashant Bhushan. It also seeks direction to Ministry of Home Affairs to expeditiously grant refugee identification cards through the Foreigners Regional Registration Office (FRRO) to the Rohingyas in the informal camps.The plea said that it is filed to protect rights guaranteed under Article 14 and Article 21, read with Article 51(c) of the Constitution, against the deportation of Rohingya refugees who have taken refuge in India after escaping widespread violence and discrimination against their community in their home country Myanmar.It sought direction to the Union government to refrain from implementing any orders on deporting the Rohingya refugees, who have been detained in Jammu. “There is a military government in Myanmar now. Their life is under threat,” said Bhushan, requesting an urgent hearing of the plea. He was referring to the latest military coup in Myanmar in February.According to official documents from the office of deputy commissioner of Jammu, there are 6,523 Rohingya in Jammu, the petitioner said.The Jammu & Kashmir administration began the process of identifying undocumented immigrants on March 6. Over 150 of them were sent to a holding centre under the Foreigners Act. Officials insisted due process of law was followed and added the immigrants sent to the centre did not carry any valid travel documents.Hundreds of thousands of Muslim Rohingya have fled Myanmar since 2017 to escape persecution and many of them have been staying in the union territory. The UN has called a Myanmar army’s campaign against the Rohingya “a textbook example of ethnic cleansing”.On January 10, last year, the top court had said that it would hear in detail, a batch of pleas challenging the Centre's decision to deport illegal Rohingya Muslim immigrants to Myanmar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-to-hear-petition-seeking-to-stop-deportation-of-rohingyas-101616640748213.html

This variant, the ministry said on Wednesday, has been detected in seven states, including Maharashtra which has been witnessing a second wave of the infection.The "double mutant" variant was detected in Delhi, Maharashtra and some other places in addition to the three "variants of concern" - first noticed in the UK, South Africa and Brazil, the ministry said at its briefing about the Covid-19 situation in the country.The ministry, however, said it could not be sufficiently established yet if these variants were behind the recent spike in Covid-19 cases in some states.Here is everything you need to know about this variant:||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/double-mutant-variant-of-sars-cov-2-found-all-you-need-to-know-about-it-101616638608245.html
25-03-2021||India||India likely to delay Covax vaccine supplies for March, April, says Unicef||India will likely delay deliveries of AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine doses to the GAVI/WHO-backed COVAX facility for March and April, the programme's procurement and distributing partner Unicef told Reuters early on Thursday."We understand that deliveries of COVID-19 vaccines to lower-income economies participating in the COVAX Facility will likely face delays following a setback in securing export licenses for further doses of COVID-19 vaccines produced by the Serum Institute of India (SII), expected to be shipped in March and April," Unicef said in an email."COVAX is in talks with the Government of India with a view to ensuring deliveries as quickly as possible."Reuters reported on Wednesday that India had put a temporary hold on all major exports of the AstraZeneca shot made by SII, the world’s biggest vaccine-maker, to meet domestic demand as infections rise.Unicef also said that Covax participant countries have also been told about lower-than-expected supplies of AstraZeneca doses made in South Korea for March."In line with the challenges of the current global supply environment, this is due to challenges the company faces in rapidly scaling up supply and optimizing production processes for these early deliveries," Unicef said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-likely-to-delay-covax-vaccine-supplies-for-march-april-says-unicef-101616633210574.html
25-03-2021||India||Delhiwale: Greenhouse getaway||Some birds, some cats, a few trees, a few graves, and absolute quietude. Spending five minutes here is enough to secede from the life of everyday. Duties, concerns, plans, worries, prospects, and all other trains of daily thoughts dissolve into silent air.Such is the magic of the place. It is a spacious courtyard tucked deep inside the congested Walled City. There must be many private courtyards and rooftops in the area with such calmly ambience, but this is one of the few that is accessible to all. The way to it passes through narrow crowded noisy lanes, but once you enter the door, you are abruptly transported into an oasis.The courtyard is home to a little-known Sufi shrine. It has about a dozen graves and looks like a miniature qabristan, or cemetery. Its very existence must be the reason behind the neighbourhood’s name in which it is situated—Mohalla Qabristan.This afternoon, every element of the courtyard is conspiring to add to the extraordinary serenity. With one distracting exception. The entire place is painted in light green. All the wall, all the graves. This specific beauty is keeping the senses in suspended excitement. In some places, the green is splashed about in differing hues, possibly because the painter applied varying number of brush strokes. That makes the view more enchanting, as if one was gazing upon some sort of modern art.The Sufi shrine lies on a lower level. The staircase leading to it is also painted green. The few graves over there are in green too. Some of them are at level with the ground. Leaves have fallen around them.One wonders about the people buried here. A man emerges, informing that these are centuries-old resting spots, and that burials no longer take place here. He explained that the green paint was applied recently to celebrate a festivity concerning the Sufi mystic, whom he addresses as Peer Baba.Soon afterwards he goes away, and the place is again still, returning to a quietness that feels extraordinarily fragile and thus doubly intense.Try coming alone.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhiwale-greenhouse-getaway-101616632562185.html
25-03-2021||India||Experts call for curbs as Capital adds 1,254 Covid cases, 6 deaths||The Capital set yet another record of single-day new infections for the year, as 1,254 new cases of Covid-19 were reported on Wednesday, even as health experts urged the Delhi government to reintroduce some curbs on social gatherings and public places to prevent the outbreak from again spiralling out of control with the festive season days away.The seven-day average of new cases, or case trajectory, has now more than doubled in just one week, clearly marking the start of Delhi’s fourth wave of Covid – on average, 886 new cases were reported every day in the past week, against 428 cases a day a week ago.The Delhi Disaster Management Authority on Tuesday banned public celebrations during Holi, Navaratri and Shab-e-Baraat. Experts on Wednesday also called for barring or restricting non-essential activities.“There are some essential activities like going to hospitals or going to banks. All other activities should be stopped,” said Dr GC Khilnani, former head of pulmonology at All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) and the chairman of the PSRI Institute of Pulmonary and Critical Care.Wednesday’s case-spike was Delhi’s highest in 96 days, with the city last adding more infections (1,418) on December 18.The Covid-19 test positivity rate also maintained its steady rise, climbing to 1.52% on Wednesday. While the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends a number below 5% for an infection to be considered under control, the positivity rate in the Capital has risen consistently over the past two weeks, which experts have warned could be an indicator that cases may skyrocket soon.“Large weddings and get-togethers are not essential. Going to restaurants and pubs is not essential. These should be restricted before cases spread further. Yes, there will be economic consequences, but it will save lives,” said Dr Khilnani.He also urged people not to take the infection lightly, adding that hospital beds reserved to treat Covid-19 patients had begun to fill up again.“There is a belief among people that cases now are mostly mild. This is absolutely not true. We are seeing many severe patients who have to be admitted to the intensive care unit and be given high oxygen support. At our hospital, wards that had been declared non-Covid had to be opened up again because of the surge in cases,” he said.The number of hospitalisations in Delhi crossed the 1,000-mark on Wednesday for the first time since January 21, with city hospitals treating 1,063 persons with Covid-19 as on Tuesday night. The number of active cases has inched closer to 5,000, with 4,890 in the city currently infected.Dr T Jacob John, former head of the virology department at the Christian Medical College in Vellore, said, “A total lockdown may not be possible and isn’t necessary. However, sensible restrictions will help. If everybody wears a mask in public, 50% of the problem is gone. If they can avoid crowds where they are touching other people, 20% of the problem is solved. So, instead of closing shops and supermarkets, the people there must be trained to ensure hand hygiene before people go in and after they come out. They need to check the customers for masks and social distancing.”Travel from neighbouring states could also be adding to Delhi’s caseload, he warned.“Delhi has a huge floating population. Many come to Delhi to find work. It is also a hub for international travel. Being the Capital, all official work is also done here. This movement adds to the number of cases. I have seen instances where one person in the family travelled to a neighbouring state and everyone else in the family got the infection later on,” said Dr Khilnani.The Delhi Disaster Management Authority on Tuesday directed the administration to conduct random tests at airport, railway stations and interstate bus terminals on people coming from affected states such as Maharashtra.Experts also called for expediting vaccinations to stem the rise in cases. “We need to increase the pace of vaccinations. This will help curb deaths among the old and those with comorbidities,” said Dr John.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/experts-call-for-curbs-as-capital-adds-1-254-covid-cases-6-deaths-101616629135656.html
25-03-2021||India||Supreme Court sets 45-day deadline for resolution plan||The Supreme Court on Wednesday directed fresh consideration of resolution plans for the debt-ridden Jaypee Group within 45 days, saying no new expression of interest will be entertained for taking over the firm and only state-owned NBCC and Suraksha Realty may file revised proposals, giving new hope for the completion of about 22,000 pending flats in Noida and Greater Noida.The apex court remitted to the Committee of Creditors (CoC) the issue of approval of the resolution plan.For about 22,000 homebuyers who have invested in the Jaypee Group’s housing projects and are still awaiting possession of their flats, the judgment has heightened hopes of an early resolution, even as there is no end in sight to the corporate insolvency resolution procedure (CIRP) of Jaypee Infratech Limited (JIL), pending before the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) since 2017.A bench of justices AM Khanwilkar, Dinesh Maheshwari and Sanjiv Khanna, in its 375-page judgment, said: “We are conscious of the requirements of the discipline of Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) and would hasten to observe that the course which is being adopted is in the complex and peculiar features of this case but, this repeat exercise concerning the CIRP of JIL cannot be an unending process and needs to be taken to its logical conclusion.”In exercise of its extraordinary powers under Article 142, the apex court directed NBCC and Suraksha Realty to submit fresh resolution plans in two weeks and directed the Committee of Creditors (which also has homebuyers) to consider it and submit a report to the adjudicating authority within an extended period of 45 days beginning Wednesday.Since August 2017, when JIL went into the insolvency process after NCLT admitted the application by an IDBI Bank-led consortium, this is the fourth round of litigation which has been decided by the apex court. On March 3 last year, NCLT approved NBCC’s bid to acquire JIL through the insolvency process and complete over 20,000 pending flats over the next three and half years. The order was, however, challenged in the appellate tribunal NCLAT and later in the Supreme Court.NCLAT had asked NBCC to implement its proposal to acquire debt-ridden JIL and complete over 20,000 pending flats, but said that its direction was subject to its final order.Last year, the Supreme Court withdrew to itself all matters pending before the NCLT and NCLAT after NBCC objected to modification in its resolution plan by the NCLT, which was later challenged by it before NCLAT. The court heard NBCC, homebuyers and other stakeholders, including the Jaypee Group, before reserving order on the way forward in October 2020.Homebuyers said that after a long wait, the order passed by the court was not on expected lines. “After so many months, we expected the court to give us a solution. The court held that ₹750 crore deposited by Jaypee Associates Limited could not be part of the resolution plan of NBCC as it was property of JAL. They should have ordered the same to be given towards construction of JAL housing projects,” said Arvind Verma, president of Knight Court Social Welfare Association, a housing project of JAL.

25-03-2021||India||Sad day, says Kejriwal as NCT bill is approved||The ruling Aam Aadmi Party in Delhi on Wednesday called it a “black day” for the Indian democracy as Parliament passed a bill seeking to give overarching powers to the Delhi lieutenant governor over the elected government and the assembly.The Rajya Sabha passed the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi (Amendment) Act, 2021 on Wednesday. The Lok Sabha passed the legislation on Monday. The bill will now be sent for the President’s approval before it becomes a law.Chief minister and AAP national convener Arvind Kejriwal called it a sad day for the Indian democracy, but added that work in Delhi will neither stop nor slow down. “RS passes GNCTD amendment Bill. Sad day for Indian democracy. We will continue our struggle to restore power back to people. Whatever be the obstacles, we will continue doing good work. Work will neither stop nor slow down,” he tweeted.Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia said the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) “fears Kejriwal”.“It is a black day for Indian democracy. The rights of the government elected by the people of Delhi have been snatched away and put in the hands of the lieutenant governor. Look at the irony - Parliament, which is the temple of democracy, was chosen for the murder of democracy. The people of Delhi will fight against this dictatorship,” Sisodia said in a tweet in Hindi.As constitutional experts and senior government officials said the bill will impact day-to-day governance in the city and functioning of the Delhi assembly, the AAP said it may move the Supreme Court against the bill.The passage of the bill comes at a time when the Delhi government is planning to bring in fundamental reforms to excise rules in the Capital and roll out an ambitious scheme to provide ration under the public distribution scheme at the doorsteps of the beneficiaries.AAP spokesperson Raghav Chadha said the bill was an unconditional attempt to make the Delhi government “administratively impotent”. “The GNCT of Delhi (Amendment) Bill, 2021 is an unconstitutional attempt to make Delhi government ‘administratively impotent’ by a political party that has been made ‘electorally impotent’ by the people of Delhi,” he said.According to the bill, “government” in the national capital would mean the “Lieutenant Governor” in context of any law to be made by the legislative assembly.Replying to the debate in the Rajya Sabha, Union minister of state for home affairs G Kishan Reddy sought to dispel the concerns of the opposition members saying the amendments in the Act will create a sound government mechanism in the NCT of Delhi.PDT Achary, former secretary general of Lok Sabha, however, said the bill suffers from serious constitutional infirmities.“It seeks to nullify the July 2018 decision of the Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court. It is against the law laid down by the Supreme Court. The definition of the government can only be the elected government,” he said. Senior government officials said once the bill becomes an Act, L-G Anil Baijal will have the power to call for any file of the Delhi government.A senior official said after the bill becomes law, it will cause increased friction between the legislature and executive.“This is because the amendment states that not just decisions of the council of ministers, but the opinion of the L-G will have to be sought on the decision taken by every minister. Delhi has seven ministers, including chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, and each of them issues dozens of orders/directives daily. The back-and-forth of files will only delay projects,” the official said. Delhi BJP president Adesh Gupta welcomed the passing of the bill, saying it will help improve administration in Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sad-day-says-kejriwal-as-nct-bill-is-approved-101616628061951.html
25-03-2021||India||India rejects Pakistan's objections over hydro projects||India has rejected Pakistan’s objections to the Pakal Dul and Lower Kalnai hydropower projects in Jammu and Kashmir and said both of them comply with the provisions of the Indus Waters Treaty of 1960.This was conveyed to the Pakistani side during a two-day meeting of the permanent Indus commission that concluded in the Indian capital on Wednesday. This was the first meeting of the commission in more than two-and-half years.Pakistan has for long objected to the construction of the Pakal Dul and Lower Kalnai projects on tributaries of the Chenab river, saying their designs are not in line with the treaty.“Discussions continued on designs of...Pakal Dul (1,000 MW) and Lower Kalnai (48 MW). Indian side held that these projects are fully compliant with the provisions of the [Indus Waters] Treaty and provided technical data in support of its position,” said a statement issued by the external affairs ministry.The Pakal Dul project is being built on Marusadar river, a tributary of the Chenab in Kishtwar district. Lower Kalnai is being built on another tributary of the same river.The Pakistani side also requested that India should share information on the design of other hydropower projects being planned. The Indian side “assured that the information will be supplied as and when required to be supplied under the provisions of the Treaty”, the statement said.The statement described the meeting as “cordial manner” and said India’s Indus water commissioner Pradeep Kumar Saxena and his Pakistani counterpart Mehr Ali Shah “reaffirmed their commitment to interact more frequently in an attempt to resolve the issues by bilateral discussions under the Treaty”.The two sides also agreed to hold the next meeting of the permanent Indus commission in Pakistan on mutually convenient dates.The treaty specifies that the waters of the three eastern rivers (Ravi, Beas and Sutlej) have been allocated exclusively to India. The western rivers (Indus, Chenab and Jhelum) are allocated to Pakistan, with India given rights such as agriculture, navigation, domestic use and unrestricted rights to develop hydroelectric power projects within the specified parameters of design and operations.Under the provisions of the Indus Waters Treaty, which was brokered by the World Bank and signed by the two countries in 1960, the two commissioners are required to meet at least once a year, alternately in India and Pakistan.The last meeting of the permanent Indus commission was held in Lahore in August 2018. The current talks were held against the backdrop of a thaw in bilateral ties, which had taken a hit after the 2019 Pulwama suicide bombing.The meeting wasn’t held last year due to the Covid-19 pandemic.Last month, the Indian and Pakistani militaries recommitted themselves to the 2003 ceasefire on the Line of Control (LoC) in Jammu and Kashmir, raising hopes for further improvements in bilateral relations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-rejects-pakistan-s-objections-over-hydro-projects-101616627503496.html
25-03-2021||India||UAPA slapped on Sachin Vaze in Antilia case||The National Investigation Agency (NIA) has invoked sections of the stringent Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA), an anti-terror law, against Sachin Vaze, the Mumbai Police assistant inspector who is the main accused in the Antilia explosives case. NIA officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that after interrogating Vaze for the past 12 days, speaking to several Mumbai Police officers and witnesses, and analysing technical evidence, they have managed to piece together the sequence of events behind the case that has caught the nation’s attention.NIA has used sections 16 and 18 of the anti-terror law against Vaze, claiming that an individual/or group of persons planning such a conspiracy can be booked under terror charges. The two sections deal with conspiring to commit a terror act. It will now seek Vaze’s further custody under UAPA on March 26, when he is produced in court.On February 25, a green Scorpio was found parked outside industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s residence in south Mumbai. It contained a bag with 20 loose sticks of gelatin (with no detonator or timer) and a threatening letter addressed to Ambani. NIA took over the probe into the explosives case on March 9 and arrested him on March 13.Officials said the agency has established that the conspiracy was planned by Vaze as his “comeback” case. HT reported on March 17, citing unnamed NIA officials, that Vaze orchestrated the incident to prove his worth to the police top brass. NIA officials claimed he wanted to regain his lost reputation due to a suspension in 2004, related to a custodial death. Vaze was only reinstated in 2020, after an alliance of the Shiv Sena, Nationalist Congress Party, and the Congress (the MVA or Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi) came to power. And he tripped up, the officials contended, because of his overconfidence.Sharing details, one NIA officer said, “As part of his plan to produce a sensational case in Mumbai and then solve it in record time, the arrested assistant police inspector, who was in charge of the Crime Intelligence Unit (CIU), asked businessman Mansukh Hiran to leave his Scorpio on the highway on February 17.”Hiran, an auto parts dealer, was previously known to Vaze, who had borrowed the same vehicle between November and the first week of February. Investigations have revealed that Vaze used to borrow cars, especially luxury vehicles, from dealers.“Hiran, after leaving the car on Mulund-Airoli Road, met Vaze near Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus the same day, and handed over the keys as asked by the officer. Vaze then asked Hiran to lodge a complaint (of a missing car) with the police, which Hiran filed on February 18,” the first officer said.From February 17 till February 25, the Scorpio was with Vaze and his associates in CIU, investigations revealed.On February 25, a second NIA investigator said, Vaze and a constable of CIU went in a convoy of two cars — the Scorpio and an Innova — to Carmichael Road around 2:20am to drop the Scorpio, laden with gelatin sticks, near Ambani’s residence, Antilia. A threat letter, addressed to Ambani and his wife, had already been placed beforehand in the vehicle. “Vaze and the constable took turns to drive Scorpio and then they returned in the Innova,” the officer said.“But, around 4.30am, Vaze returned to the spot to check the Scorpio as he thought he had left his identity card in it by mistake,” the second officer added. This visit, NIA officials said, has been established by CCTV footage from Mulund toll naka, where the Innova can be seen re-entering Mumbai from Thane around 4am after leaving the city about half-an-hour earlier.NIA officials said the agency will likely make the constable, whom they did not name, a witness rather than charge him in conspiracy. They added that the constable has confirmed the role of Vaze in the conspiracy.Once he was made the investigating officer of the case, Vaze asked Hiran to take the rap, but the latter demurred, said a third NIA officer.NIA officials believe that Vaze’s plan was to create some link between Hiran (once he confessed) and some Pakistani terror group or suspect, to make it look like a conspiracy planned by Pakistan’s spy agency Inter Services Intelligence. The officials admitted that this remains a theory that is yet to be proved.The NIA officials said they cannot comment on Hiran’s murder — his body was found in a creek on March 5— because the Maharashtra Anti Terrorist Squad (ATS) is yet to hand over the case. ATS, which on Wednesday was asked to do so by a Thane court, claims to have solved the case. At a press conference on Tuesday, ATS said that Vaze was the “mastermind” behind the murder, which was carried out by Naresh Gor (a bookie) and Vinayak Shinde (former constable).NIA officials said they have Vaze’s call records, showing multiple calls to and from with Hiran in February and much before that. They also claim to have his location data, his presence at various locations as seen in CCTV footage, and testimony from witnesses.NIA officials said the agency is still probing the role of officers from CIU and Mumbai Police in general, including assistant police inspector Riyazuddin Kazi, a close associate of Vaze in CIU who has already been questioned, and others.The officials added that their investigation has revealed the influence Vaze, a former encounter specialist (a colloquialism used to describe policemen who shoot down gangsters in encounters, real and staged) enjoyed in Mumbai Police — far in excess of what an assistant inspector usually would. Vaze, a member of the Shiv Sena, made no effort to hide either his pelf (he used to occasionally drive to work in a Mercedes SUV that has been seized by NIA), or his power (he was close to several politicians, and former Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh).Tracking Vaze, NIA has also found CCTV footage from several five-star hotels where the policeman used to stay for days on end. NIA officials say he made a lump sum payment of ₹13 lakh to one of the hotels for a total of 100-days stay. “We have information this hotel and others were used for illegal financial dealings of Vaze and extortion activities,” the second NIA officer said.Vaze has given misleading answers to NIA for the past 12 days and has claimed that he is being framed by his rivals in Mumbai Police. He is also yet to disclose where he got the gelatin sticks from.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uapa-slapped-on-sachin-vaze-in-antilia-case-101616627178879.html

It was found in a large number of samples, 206, in Maharashtra, which is in the grip of its worst wave of infections yet. “These mutations have been found in about 15-20% of samples and do not match any previously catalogued VOCs,” the ministry said in a statement. VOCs refers to variants of concern.The director of the National Centre for Disease Control, Dr Sujeet Kumar said at the government’s weekly briefing on Covid-19 later in the day, that while 206 samples from Maharashtra had the new variant, “ data does not allow for us to make a direct correlation yet for the rise in cases.”Also read: How bad is the current wave of Covid in India?But other experts said the likelihood of a correlation is very high. “If 20% of samples in states like Maharashtra have shown mutant variants, it is very likely that the surge in Covid-19 cases is being driven by these mutations,” said Dr Gagandeep Kang, one of India’s top vaccinologists.The officials at the briefing also said that samples from six more states recorded this variant, with Delhi having the next highest numbers at 9.The government also confirmed the discovery of large number of people with the UK variant (B.1.1.7) in Punjab (336 cases) and in the case of this variant too, Delhi recorded the second-highest number of samples with this variant at 75. The UK variant is one of three VOCs. The other two were first seen in South Africa (B.1.351) and Brazil (P.1). In all, 771 samples from 18 states have turned up positive for these VOCs. “Since INSACOG initiated its work, 771 variants of concerns (VOCs) have been detected in a total of 10787 positive samples shared by States/UTs. These include 736 samples positive for viruses of the UK (B.1.1.7) lineage. 34 samples were found positive for viruses of the South African (B.1.351) lineage. 1 sample was found positive for viruses of the Brazilian (P.1) lineage. The samples with these VOCs have been identified in 18 States of the country,” the health ministry said. INSACOG stands for Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genomic Consortia.Officials who asked not to be named said most of these were of people who came back from other countries and their contacts. In Punjab, CM Amarinder Singh said on Tuesday that most of the B.1.1.7 variants (326 out of 336) were found in samples taken from the community.“Mutations in viruses occur naturally. It is a law of nature and we should per se not panic. We should remember if the virus does not replicate, it will not mutate — hence, the way to combat mutations is to suppress the chain of transmission,” said VK Paul, member (health), Niti Aayog, during the briefing.Also read: Covid-19 vaccine drive faces uphill battle against fresh waveExperts said the situation must now be closely watched, particularly in states where a large number of samples have the novel variant or the variants of concern. On Wednesday, Maharashtra accounted for 60% of the 53,410 daily new cases in the country and Punjab, 5%, although cases here have risen sharply from a low base.Kang warned variants can have an impact on vaccine efficacy. “Vaccines may not be quite as effective against variants that are capable of immune escape, but it is very unlikely that vaccines will not protect at all against severe disease. We will have some protection from either prior infection and vaccination.”An expert associated with the Maharashtra government’s Covid-19 response said the state is monitoring the variant’s impact closely. “It will become a cause for grave concern if mortality begins to increase. Presently mortality figures are considerably stable,” said this person, asking not to be named.Dr Anurag Agarwal, director, CSIR-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology, said, “Presence of a variant of concern or suspected variant of concern does not automatically mean that they are causing the outbreak, but rather suggest caution and implementation of public health measures for containment. It is of course concerning, so these measures are being taken in parallel with investigations into the transmissibility, inhibition by antibodies of recovered people and inhibition by antibodies of vaccinated people, of such variants.”Experts have long called for increasing genomic sequencing. The Indian consortium of labs under INSACOG carrying out genomic sequencing targeted 5% of all positive cases to be analysed beginning January, but, at a little under 11,000 , this number is short of the at least 48,000 it should have been, based on the number of 966,376 cases recorded between January 1 and March 23.“The volume (of genomic sequencing) has been increased, I would say exponentially, in the past three months. Before INSACOG was established, we had sequenced 3,000 positive samples, which has gone up to about 11,000 now. It will obviously increase as we go on from here,” said Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan at the briefing.The Sars-Cov-2 virus was seen to be picking up about two mutations a month. But in mid-December, authorities in UK announced they had found a new variant with an unusually high number (17) of mutations and appeared to be spreading at a faster rate because it was more infective.Later analyses showed this variant, which is regarded to get its most serious characteristic from the mutation N501Y, had a transmission advantage that was 0.4-0.7 times more than the predominant variant. This increase may seem minuscule but could lead to a significantly wider outbreak – as it eventually did in the UK, which struggled to bring down cases despite a lockdown over most of the winter.On Wednesday, the government did not disclose how many other mutations are in the variant that has the E484Q and L452R. The two mutations occur on the spike protein, the portion of the virus that latches onto human cells and enters it.The South African and the Brazilian variants both contain the E484K mutation. L452R is a mutation linked to a fast-spreading variant in California, US.(with inputs from Eeshanpriya MS in Mumbai)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/double-mutant-variant-of-virus-found-as-cases-hit-53000-101616626775259.html
25-03-2021||India||Stalkers convicted of murdering Nikita Tomar||A fast-track court in Faridabad on Wednesday held two men, Touseef and Rehaan, guilty of murder in the Nikita Tomar case within five months of the incident that shocked the National Capital Region and brought women’s safety into sharp focus.Tomar was shot dead at point blank range in broad daylight right outside her college in Faridabad by the men who were stalking her, with the shooting captured in CCTV footage.The court of additional sessions judge Sartaj Baswana convicted the two of murder, kidnapping, homicide and conspiracy. The quantum of sentence will be pronounced on Friday, said advocate Adal Singh Rawat, counsel for the victim’s family. Prime accused Touseef was also held guilty under the Arms Act. However, Azruddin, the third accused in the case, who allegedly supplied the murder weapon, was acquitted.The 21-year-old victim was shot dead on October 26, leading to her family alleging that the murder was linked to “love jihad” as Touseef had been stalking her, pressuring her to marry him and change her religion. “Love jihad” is a term popularised by right-wing groups alleging a conspiracy by Muslim men to lure Hindu women into marriage for the purpose of changing their religion.The court on Wednesday found Touseef and Rehaan guilty under Sections 302, 366, 511, 120B/34 of the IPC. Touseef was also convicted under Section 27/1 of the Arms Act.Faridabad police tweeted the timeline of the case and the verdict issued by the court with the hashtag “#justicefornikita”.“Nikita Tomar murder (26/10/2020, accused Touseef arrested the same evening, 27/10/2020 Rehaan arrested, 28/10/2020 Azruddin arrested, 6/11/2020 challan produced in court, 24/3/2021 verdict announced, 26/3/2021 sentence to be pronounced,” the tweet said. Asked to comment on the case, a spokesperson for Faridabad Police said an official statement would be released on Friday after the sentencing.During the course of hearing by the fast-track court, production of evidence started on December 1. The counsel for the victim’s family said 55 witnesses were produced by the prosecution while two were produced by the defence. The court heard the case twice a week and after holding arguments on March 22 and March 23, announced the verdict on March 24.The family of the victim expressed satisfaction at the verdict and demanded that the accused be given maximum punishment for the crime. “The investigation conducted by the police and the speed with which the case was heard by the fast-track court has ensured justice for Nikita,” said Rawat, counsel for the family and also a maternal uncle of the victim.The failed abduction bid and subsequent murder of the young woman was caught on CCTV cameras. The footage showed Touseef and Rehaan trying to push Tomar into their car as she stepped out of Aggarwal College after writing an exam. The footage also showed that as the accused could not push Tomar into the car due to her resistance, Touseef shot at her and escaped with his accomplice.Fingerprints of the accused were matched during the investigation from three samples that included the getaway car, the pistol used for the murder, and the woman’s arm.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/stalkers-convicted-of-murdering-nikita-tomar-101616626262972.html
25-03-2021||India||Parliament passes law on greater power to Delhi LG||Parliament on Wednesday cleared controversial legal amendments that effectively hand executive powers over to Delhi’s lieutenant governor from the city-state’s legislative assembly, following angry protests and a walkout by several opposition parties.The National Capital Territory of Delhi (Amendment) Bill, 2021, cleared with an 83-45 vote in Rajya Sabha, says that “government” in Delhi will now refer to the L-G in the context of all laws passed in Delhi, and the opinion of the L-G will be mandatory before any executive action is taken. The bill was approved by Lok Sabha on Monday.The bill was cleared by the Upper House following several hours of heated debate, followed by a division of votes demanded by the Opposition. The Biju Janata Dal, YSR Congress and Samajwadi Party opposed the bill, but walked out in protest. The Congress walked out after the division of votes.“I would like to tell the people of Delhi and the whole country that we have full belief in the Constitution. We did not bring this bill to create problems for the Delhi govt... I request every member to support the Bill unequivocally,” MoS G Krishna Reddy said in the Rajya Sabha.Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said it was a “sad day for Indian democracy”.“RS passes GNCTD amendment bill. Sad day for Indian democracy. We will continue our struggle to restore power back to people. Whatever be the obstacles, we will continue doing good work. Work will neither stop nor slow down,” he tweeted.Opposition parties, including the Congress, said the proposed legislation was unconstitutional and demanded it be referred to a select committee for scrutiny.Congress MP Abhishek Manu Singhvi said it is “most unconstitutional bill” which the House has ever received and went on to say that “even the Delhi BJP should join us in opposing this”. “Make no mistake, friends, this is not about AAP, or Congress or BJP. It’s about the fundamentals of federalism...,” he said, and alleged that the current regime at Centre was engaged into “coercive federalism”.Reddy rejected the criticism. “We’re making amendments to the Act brought in by Congress in 1991. These are not new. We are bringing these amendments to ensure that Delhi Govt functions properly,” he said.The provisions of the bill say “before taking any executive action... the opinion of Lieutenant Governor... shall be obtained on all such matters as may be specified, by a general or special order”, and that the “legislative assembly shall not make any rule to enable itself or its committees to consider the matters of day-to-day administration or conduct inquiries”.It also adds that “...and any of the rule made in contravention of this proviso before the commencement of the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi (Amendment) Act, 2021, shall be void” -- effectively nullifying the assembly committees.The bill was introduced in the Rajya Sabha on Tuesday, and triggered anger at the time as well. On Wednesday, amid protests by the Opposition, the House was briefly adjourned twice in the second half.Opposing the bill, Aam Aadmi Party member Sanjay Singh said the BJP government at the Centre has brought the bill as the party lost the Delhi assembly elections twice. He said he was seeking “justice” for the 20 million people of Delhi.BJP’s Bhupinder Yadav said the bill is important to strengthen federalism and that the L-G, “who is the rightful head of the state government will be able to take timely decision, thanks to this bill”. He criticised the AAP government for not being able to curb pollution, while claiming that Delhi’s fight against Covid-19 “was fought by the central government when the state gave up” -- sparking protests by the opposition.After Rajya Sabha deputy chairman Harivansh asked if the motion on the bill could be adopted, the opposition sought a division of votes.Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge announced that the Congress will stage a walkout to oppose the bill. “If you make LG the government (of Delhi state) what is the need for elections. And also there is no need then for representatives to chose chief minister. This (bill) is against the Constitution,” he said.Members from Trinamool Congress and Shiv Sena, too, protested the legislation.BJD’s Prasanna Acharya said the Centre should have held wider consultations. “My party does not want to be a party to this bill. We are staging a peaceful walkout,” he said. P Wilson of DMK termed the bill as “blot on the Constitution”. He cautioned that it would be stayed by courts even if it is passed by Parliament. SP’s VP Nishad and CPI-M’s Jharna Das Baidya too said the bill was unconstitutional and RJD’s Manoj Jha said his party was opposing the proposed law “on constitutional parameter and moral principles”.PDT Achary, former secretary general of Lok Sabha, said the bill suffers from serious constitutional infirmities.“It seeks to nullify the July 2018 decision of the constitution Bench of the Supreme Court without changing the basis of that decision. It is against the law laid down by the Supreme Court. The definition of the government can only be the elected government,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/parliament-passes-law-on-greater-power-to-delhi-lg-101616625866549.html
25-03-2021||India||Court summons P Chidambaram and Karti in INX Media case||A Delhi court on Wednesday summoned former Union minister and senior Congress leader P Chidambaram, his son Karti Chidambaram and eight others on April 7 taking cognizance of the Enforcement Directorate (ED) charge sheet in connection with their alleged role in the INX Media money laundering case.Special judge MK Nagpal said that there were sufficient grounds to proceed against the accused including Karti’s chartered accountant S S Bhaskararaman, Peter Mukerjea and six firms including INX Media and INX News.The charge sheet by the ED was filed under section 3 (money laundering) read with section 70 (offences by companies), which is punishable under section 4 (punishment) of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA).According to the ED’s charge sheet, the first instalment of illegal gratification of ₹3,08,62,044­, in furtherance of criminal conspiracy, was allegedly paid by INX Media to M/s Advantage Strategic Consulting Pvt Ltd (ASCPL) and two other shell companies beneficially owned or controlled by Karti, namely M/s Kriya FMCG Distributors Pvt Ltd (Kriya) and M/s CBN Placement and Management Centre (CBNPMC) and this amount was paid during the year 2007-08 through the companies named SpanFibre and M/s Satyam Fibre (India) Pvt Ltd (Satyam Fibre).“Thus, in view of the background and after going through the contents of this complaint and the documents referred to therein and being relied upon in support of the allegations contained in complaint, I find sufficient material and grounds for proceeding further in the matter against all the 10 accused persons named in the complaint, out of which six accused are companies, for commission of offence under section 3 read with section 70 of the PMLA, which is punishable under section 4 of the Act,” the judge said in his order.The ED’s case arises out of a complaint registered by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) where it had contended that P Chidambaram had “misused his official position”, in conspiracy with his son Karti and others, in granting approval to a FDI proposal of INX Media and INX News Pvt Ltd in lieu of “illegal gratification” in India and through offshore payments. The CBI registered an FIR on May 15, 2017 alleging irregularities in a Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) clearance granted to the INX Media group for receiving overseas funds of ₹305 crore in 2007 during Chidambaram’s tenure as the Union finance minister. Subsequently, the ED had lodged the money-laundering case.Both Chidambaram and his son Karti are currently on bail in the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/court-summons-p-chidambaram-and-karti-in-inx-media-case-101616624804764.html
25-03-2021||India||MJ Akbar moves Delhi High Court against acquittal of Priya Ramani||The Delhi high court will hear on Thursday an appeal by former Union minister MJ Akbar against the dismissal of his criminal defamation case against journalist Priya Ramani.A single judge bench of justice Mukta Gupta will hear Akbar’s petition that has challenged the February 17 decision of a city court, clearing Ramani of defamation charges for her allegations of sexual harassment against him.The appeal, filed by Karanjawala & Co, has referred to portions of the trial court’s judgment which admitted in one part that the content referred to by Akbar was “defamatory in nature”, and that the “defence of the accused regarding” only part of the article referring to Akbar and the rest to “other male bosses is rejected” .Akbar has sought to highlight that once the trial court held that the content was defamatory in nature, there was a duty cast upon the trial judge to explain what exactly Ramani opted as her defence to this charge, and how her defence was accepted.It has further pointed out that the trial court dismissed Ramani’s defence that only part of the article was about Akbar and rest were about other male bosses since the article did not mark any distinction but failed to explain why she was not held culpable.Further, Akbar questioned the trial court’s verdict for accepting Ramani’s defence when she called an incorrect tweet by her about resignation by Akbar as an “honest mistake”. The appeal said the trial court did not analyse the evidence in this regard nor did it assess the impact of the wrong post on his reputation.On February 17, the trial court judgment had held that “Akbar was not a man of stellar reputation”, and reasoned that “the right to reputation cannot be protected at the cost of right to life and dignity of women as guaranteed in the Indian Constitution...”.It added that “.. perpetrators of sexual harassment ... can also be a person of reputation...”. Based on this reasoning, laid out in the verdict, judge Ravindra Kumar Pandey acquitted Ramani.The case concerns Ramani’s tweet in 2018, read in consonance with an article she wrote for Vogue magazine in 2017. In the article, she wrote about a situation where an editor interviewing her made her feel uncomfortable by conducting the interview in his hotel room.In the tweet, which came in the wake of the MeToo movement, she named Akbar as the editor. Several other women spoke about their experiences with him at the same time; one of them Ghazala Wahab even testified in favour of Ramani during the case.Akbar resigned as junior foreign minister after the allegations surfaced, and sued Ramani for defamation..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mj-akbar-moves-delhi-high-court-against-acquittal-of-priya-ramani-101616624808839.html
25-03-2021||India||Supreme Court asks Param Bir Singh to move Bombay High Court||The Supreme Court on Wednesday commented that it was all “hunky-dory” between former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh and Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh for a long time before they fell out, and asked Singh to approach the Bombay high court for a Central Bureau of Investigation probe against Deshmukh for allegedly running a “money collection scheme” through the police, the subject of a plea by the former top cop in the apex court.The move provides a temporary respite to both Deshmukh and the state government, which has rallied behind the home minister despite vocal calls for his resignation from several quarters, most notably the opposition Bharatija Janata Party.Singh was transferred to a low-key post in Mumbai Police’s home guards on March 17 over his mishandling of a case where explosives were found in an abandoned vehicle outside billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s residence Antilia and the subsequent arrest of suspended police officer Sachin Vaze in the case.On Wednesday, a bench of justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and R Subhas Reddy declined to entertain Singh’s petition in the first instance, recording in its order that the high court had wider powers under Article 226 (writ jurisdiction) and that it could also examine the need for a probe by a central agency.“We have no doubt that the matter is quite serious and affects the administration at large. It also appears that a lot of material which has come in (the) public domain is a consequence of the personae falling out,” noted the court in its order, as it further took note that the high court could also examine an August 2020 report by former commissioner of state intelligence Rashmi Shukla regarding corruption and the involvement of middlemen in police postings in Maharashtra.“Concerned parties have been hunky-dory for a long period and now they have fallen apart...Here is an issue relating to two personae till the time it erupted in the public glare. One person moved out and then they started saying something against each other. The question for you is why not go to the high court under Article 226?” the bench asked senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, who represented Singh.Rohatgi sought to persuade the bench by listing out several cases, including the Hathras rape and murder case from Uttar Pradesh, in which the Supreme Court directly entertained writ petitions and passed orders. He added that Singh’s petition raised matters of great public interest affecting the citizens of the country.“Agreed, we also note and record that it is a serious issue. But why should the high court not do it under Article 226? You want investigation by an independent agency and that also can be done by the high court. You (Singh) are a directly affected person. You should go to the high court first,” justice Kaul told Rohatgi. The bench also pointed out that Singh has not made Deshmukh a party to his petition despite making a spate of accusations against the home minister.When Rohatgi said that this was a case of political interference in the police department in violation of the Supreme Court ruling in the Prakash Singh case of 2006 that sought to insulate the police machinery, justice Kaul retorted: “Has any state enforced Prakash Singh? No state wants to let go of its power. No reform has taken place despite Prakash Singh and as soon as an episode happens, everyone remembers our judgments.”The court added: “In our view, this is only a mantra recited periodically, wherever the occasion so suits, and there has been no seriousness by all concerned to ever implement the directions enshrined in the judgment.”Rohatgi then opted to withdraw the petition with the liberty to urgently move the Bombay high court and seek a hearing. “I will approach the high court today afternoon itself. I will also request the high court for a hearing on Thursday,” Rohatgi told the bench.He also urged the Supreme Court to record that the high court should take up the case on Thursday since CCTV footage from Deshmukh’s residence was not being handed over to the NIA (National Investigation Agency) by the ATS (anti-terrorism squad) and that Singh apprehended that the evidence of meetings between Deshmukh and Vaze could be destroyed.Justice Kaul, however, told Rohatgi that as a matter of principle, his bench did not fix dates of hearing before the high courts since they were also constitutional courts and must be allowed to decide such housekeeping issues on their own.The bench then disposed of the matter and added Deshmukh and the NIA as parties to Singh’s petition on Rohatgi’s request.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta remained present during the proceedings on behalf of the central government and CBI but did not make any submission as the matter was sent to the high court.In his petition before the top court, Singh said he was transferred to home guards “immediately” after he brought the corrupt practices of Deshmukh to the knowledge of Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar and some other senior leaders in the state government.The petition contended that NCP leader Deshmukh held various meetings in February 2021 at his residence with police officers, including Sachin Vaze of the Crime Intelligence Unit, Mumbai, and Sanjay Patil, ACP (Social Service Branch), Mumbai, bypassing their seniors, and asked them to collect ₹100 crore every month from establishments such as bars, hookah parlours and restaurants.Singh submitted he was being made a “scapegoat to divert attention” in the Antilia case, highlighting that while there were vertically five officers between him and Vaze, Deshmukh was the one meeting Vaze at his residence.In that case, now being investigated by NIA, Vaze has already been arrested. The state ATS has also named Vaze the main accused in the death of Mansukh Hiran who was in possession of the vehicle found with the explosives, but reported it stolen a few days before the incident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-asks-param-bir-singh-to-move-bombay-high-court-101616619251599.html
25-03-2021||India||Amit Shah promises action as row over nuns’ harassment in UP intensifies||Union home minister Amit Shah on Wednesday assured action in the alleged attack on nuns by a group of Bajrang Dal activists on a train in Uttar Pradesh’s Jhansi soon after Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan said that such incidents tarnish the image of the nation.Shah was speaking at a poll rally in Kochi ahead of the April 6 state elections.“Those involved in the Jhansi nuns’ harassment incident will be brought before the law. I want to assure the people of Kerala that the culprits behind this incident will be brought to justice at the earliest,” he said.In a detailed statement on Tuesday, the church media commission said that the nuns, from a congregation of Kerala-based Syro-Malabar Church, and a group of girls were on their way from Delhi to Odisha in a train on March 19 for Easter celebrations when they were confronted by the Bajrang Dal activists in Jhansi. The church said that the nuns were verbally abused and activists tried to attack the girls, whom they believed, were being taken away for religious conversion.While the Kerala Catholic Bishops Conference (KCBC) and Syro-Malabar Church have sought action against the alleged attackers, Vijayan in a letter to Shah sought strict action against those “who disrupt and impair the freedom of individual rights” guaranteed by the Constitution.The CM said the nuns and the postulants were forcefully removed from the train by the police following a complaint from the Bajrang Dal activists alleging that the two girls were being taken for forceful religious conversion.“You would agree with me that such incidents tarnish the image of the nation and its ancient tradition of religious tolerance and practice. Such incidents require utmost condemnation by the Union Government,” Vijayan said.What happened in Uttar Pradesh should not have happened in the country and it is a “very serious matter,” the CM said, attacking the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party in UP.“Violence in the name of religion is on the rise in many parts of our country. Violence against women and marginalized groups are on the rise…Uttar Pradesh is notorious for such matters. All such illegal activities are taking place under the ruling BJP government there. It should also be taken seriously that all this is happening on an uncontrolled scale,” Vijayan said.The incident occurred at a time when the BJP is wooing Christian minorities who form 16% of the votebank to get a foothold in the central Travancore area.At the rally in Kochi, Shah accused Vijayan of having close links with the prime accused in the gold smuggling case.“Who appointed the principal secretary who was arrested in money laundering and smuggling cases? Why was he sacked later? The CM can’t wash away his hands like this. Did the secretary and CM travel abroad with the main accused or not,” Shah said.Without naming the prime accused in the case, Swapna Suresh and M Sivasankar, who were arrested by central agencies in connection with case, the Union minister asked, “Why did the accused woman come to the CM’s residence regularly? Who appointed her in a key post with ₹3 lakh salary? Did the accused make foreign trips with state fund with the permission of the state government.”Justifying the investigation by central agencies in the case, he said if any scandal took place in the country, it will be probed by the Indian agencies and not those from the UN.Last week, the state government booked officials of the Enforcement Directorate for allegedly trying to implicate the CM in the gold smuggling case.Shah said the people of the state see BJP as an alternative for the opposition UDF and ruling LDF.Addressing a road show in Tripunithara on the outskirts of Kochi, Shah said also targeted the LDF government for its handling of the Sabarimala temple issue in 2018.“It is not easy for believers to forget the way the government trampled their customs and jailed thousands of them. The government is answerable to faithful for its various criminal acts at the holy shrine,” he said.During the three-month long annual pilgrimage season in 2018, the Kerala witnessed large-scale violence when the state government tried to enforce the Supreme Court verdict annulling a decades-old bar on the entry of women of child-bearing age to the Sabarimala temple. Nearly a dozen women in the age group of 10-50 were stopped from entering the temple.“It is time to bring a change in Kerala. Senior bureaucrats such as E Sreedharan are also joining the BJP because they know only the BJP can help develop Kerala further under the leadership of PM Modi. LDF-UDF cannot,” he said.The senior BJP leader also hit out Congress’s Wayanad MP Rahul Gandhi, calling his frequent visits to the state “picnic trips”. “In Kerala he talks against left but in West Bengal both are thick friends and fighting elections together. Congress has no qualms in aligning with the Muslim League in Kerala and Shiv Sena in Maharashtra,” he said.(With Agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amit-shah-promises-action-as-row-over-nuns-harassment-in-up-intensifies-101616619274579.html
25-03-2021||India||Covid-19 vaccine drive faces uphill battle against fresh wave||While the rate of vaccination has picked up through the month of March, when India’s drive was expanded to include those most vulnerable to Covid-19, the country’s inoculation campaign still faces an uphill battle as it races against the surge of new infections in the second wave, shows data. The main reason for the pace would appear to be a reluctance among people to be vaccinated (or vaccine hesitancy), something the government is trying to address by expanding the eligibility criteria.The total number of doses administered across the country crossed 50 million on Tuesday night, with 42.7 million people having received at least one dose of the vaccine in the country till Tuesday night. A total of 8.1 million people, meanwhile, have received both doses, according to data from the Union health ministry. In over two months since the start of the vaccination drive on January 16, India has administered only around 8.5% of its target of 600 million doses (to cover 300 million people) by the end of July.This means India has just over four months to achieve the remaining 91.5%. To cover this, the vaccination drive needs to be further expanded to deliver 4.2 million shots every day for the remaining 130 days. To be sure, the government has repeatedly spoken of administering 5 million doses a day. The highest it has achieved on a single day so far is 3.4 million on March 22.Over the past month, an alarmingly strong second wave of infections has raged across India despite the roll-out of vaccines. The seven-day average of daily cases has risen to 39,526 infections a day in the past week from a low of 10,988 on February 11 – an increase of 260% in just over a month.To be sure, the pace of vaccination has also picked up considerably since as the inoculation drive moved into its second phase from March 1. More than half (52%) of all doses administered throughout India’s vaccination drive have come in just the previous two weeks.On Tuesday, the government also announced a further expansion of the eligibility criteria -- all people above 45 years of age will be made eligible to get Covid-19 vaccine from April 1. The move is likely to further boost daily vaccination numbers. With the expansion announced on Tuesday, more than a quarter (25.3%) of the country’s projected population (as on March 1, 2021) is now eligible for the vaccine, according estimates by the Technical Group on Population Projections under the National Commission on Population.Removing even more barriers on eligibility criteria would only go on to improve the coverage of the vaccination drive and further control cases, experts said.Till Tuesday, the world’s worst-hit nation, the United States has vaccinated a quarter of its population – 82.8 million people out of a population of 330 million. The United Kingdom, meanwhile, has vaccinated 41% of its population. Both countries were completely overwhelmed with cases at the start of 2021, are now defying a global trend of new waves. In the US, average daily cases have dropped from over 250,000 in January to around 55,000 in the last week; in the UK, this has dropped from nearly 60,000 new infections a day in January to 5000 in the last week. At the opposite end of this spectrum is Brazil where a slow inoculation drive has failed to arrest rising cases. The South American nation, which has inoculated only 5% of its population till Tuesday, is now the world’s largest Covid hot spot and is reporting a record 75,000 new cases every day.Experts said it’s very clear that the mass vaccination has helped the US and UK.“The short answer (to whether vaccines have helped prevent new waves in the UK and US) is a resounding ‘yes’. Israel is another country that has shifted its curve using vaccines. Of course, the devil is always in the details. India is a big and complex country, but has the advantage of being home to a robust vaccine industry. We can also do this provided three factors: first, there is sufficient vaccine supply coming through; second, there are sufficient delivery points (this can be expanded because the government has the capacity); and third, there is no vaccine hesitancy,” said Dr Shahid Jameel, virologist and director of Trivedi School of Biosciences at Ashoka University.Under the drive’s first phase in India, only health care workers and frontline workers were vaccinated till the end of February. Phase two of the drive included people over 60 years of age and those aged 45 and above with specified co-morbid conditions.Till Tuesday night, 21.8 million people who are above the age of 60 years received a shot each, 8.4 million frontline workers received at least one shot, as did 7.9 million health care workers, and 4.7 million people between 45 and 60 years with comorbidities. Meanwhile, 3.1 million frontline workers and 5 million health care workers received second doses.The Union government is now stressing on the need to speed up the vaccination drive, especially in the light of the second wave.“While the vaccination drive is proceeding smoothly, the pace is uneven across different states and UTs; and, the slow pace of vaccination in some states/UTs is a matter of concern. Vaccination… in the present scenario is critical to break the chain of transmission. Therefore, all state/UT governments should rapidly step up the pace of vaccination, to cover all priority groups in an expeditious manner,” the Union ministry of health affairs said in a statement on Tuesday.Dr Gauri Agarwal, founder, Genestrings Diagnostics, said, “With the announcement of opening Covid-19 vaccines for all people above the age of 45, India has widened the safety net for many more people. Many Indians above 45 have various degrees of lifestyle diseases that makes them susceptible to contracting the infection. This move will play a key role in increasing the number of inoculated people significantly and rapidly, which is the need of the hour in view of the rising cases in many parts of the country.”(With inputs from Rhythma Kaul)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-vaccine-drive-faces-uphill-battle-against-fresh-wave-101616619283699.html
25-03-2021||India||Justice NV Ramana: From a student leader to next CJI||From a student leader who fought for civil liberties during the nationwide Emergency in 1975 while sacrificing an academic year to taking over as the 48th chief justice of India next month, justice NV Ramana has had a remarkable journey.Born into a humble family of agriculturalists in Ponnavaram village of Andhra Pradesh’s Krishna district, justice Ramana was asked by his father in June 1975 to pack an extra change of clothes after he presided over a public meeting against the Emergency.“My father was convinced that I will be arrested,” justice Ramana recounted his experience at an event in the national capital in January when he added that he had no regrets losing a year of college when he saw so many young people sacrifice their lives for the sake of human rights.Before he joined a law college in 1980, justice Ramana worked as a journalist for a regional newspaper for two years. He was enrolled at the Bar in 1983. As a lawyer, he practised in the Andhra Pradesh high court, central administrative tribunal, the AP state administrative tribunal, and the Supreme Court in civil, criminal, constitutional, labour, service and election matters, with specialisation in constitutional, criminal, service and inter-state river laws.He was appointed a permanent judge of the Andhra Pradesh high court in 2000 and was elevated as chief justice of the Delhi high court in 2013. On February 17, 2014, he was elevated as a Supreme Court judge.Over the years, justice Ramana has been a part of several landmark judgments. He headed the bench which in January last year ruled that access to the internet is a fundamental right by extension while pulling the government up for the telecommunications blackout in Jammu & Kashmir after abrogation of Article 370. The bench then ordered the J&K administration to review all orders pertaining to the imposition of curbs on telecom and internet services and put them in the public domain.Adjudicating a bunch of petitions on the Kashmir restrictions, justice Ramana’s bench also underscored the significance of the freedom of the press. “Responsible governments are required to respect the freedom of the press at all times... journalists are to be accommodated in reporting and there is no justification for allowing a sword of Damocles to hang over the press indefinitely,” his verdict held.Justice Ramana delivered another important verdict in the Karnataka assembly case, clarifying the legal position that disqualification under the Tenth Schedule for defection could not operate as a bar for contesting re-election.Emphasising the role of the Speaker, justice Ramana wrote in the judgment: “There is a growing trend of the Speaker acting against the constitutional duty of being neutral. Further, horse-trading and corrupt practices associated with defection and change of loyalty for lure of office or wrong reasons have not abated. Thereby the citizens are denied stable governments. In these circumstances, there is need to consider strengthening certain aspects, so that such undemocratic practices are discouraged and checked.”By a judgment in January this year, justice Ramana held that fixing a notional income for a non-earning homemaker was a step towards the constitutional vision of social equality and ensuring dignity of life to all individuals.The verdict highlighted that fixing a notional income for homemakers was a step towards “recognition of the multitude of women who are engaged in this activity, whether by choice or as a result of social/cultural norms. It signals to society at large that the law and the courts of the land believe in the value of the labour, services and sacrifices of homemakers.”In a more recent ruling, a bench headed by justice Ramana held in February the restriction against grant of bail in a stringent law like The Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967 “per se does not oust the ability of Constitutional Courts to grant bail on grounds of violation” of a fundamental right like the right to a speedy trial.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nv-ramana-from-a-student-leader-to-next-cji-101616619289591.html
25-03-2021||India||Isro’s Chandrayaan-3 launch next year: Govt||The Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) plans to launch its third mission to the Moon next year, the government said on Wednesday. In a written response to a question in the Lok Sabha, minister of state for the department of space, Jitendra Singh, said that the Chandrayaan-3 mission will carry only a lander and a rover.The space agency earlier planned to launch the Chandrayaan 3 mission either in late 2020 or early 2021. However, most missions were rescheduled due to the Covid-19 pandemic.“The integrated spacecraft is being realised for planned launch during 2022,” Singh said, adding that the spacecraft is in “advanced stages” of realisation, with the propulsion system already built and undergoing tests. The lander structure has also been built and is currently being fitted with its propulsion system, he said.India’s second mission to the Moon, Chandrayaan-2, lost contact with Earth just 2.1km away from the surface of the Moon in 2019. While the lander, Vikram, made a hard landing on the lunar surface, the orbiter is expected to remain in position for seven years.“There was a problem at the very last leg of the journey of the lander. For the third mission, we have to ensure -- one, there is no problems with the thrusters; two, the system is fault tolerant so that even if there is some issue, for example thrusters not working, the system can automatically course correct; three, we have to ensure that the Chandrayaan-2 orbiter communicates with the lander throughout the powered decent because it is capable of giving last-minute commands if necessary,” said Dr M Annadurai, former director of the Isro satellite centre in Bangaluru.The Vikram lander and Pragyan rover aboard the Chandrayaan-2 were to land near the lunar south pole, where the mission was expected to observe water molecules frozen in the darker regions of the Moon.This year, Isro has planned two missions in December – the first unmanned flight under the Gaganyaan mission, and India’s first solar mission.The unmanned flight will bring India’s human spaceflight programme one step closer to sending humans to low earth orbit; the final mission will be undertaken after a successful second unmanned flight scheduled for next year.The solar mission, Aditya L1, will see the space agency send a satellite 1.5 million kilometres away to the Lagrangian point, between the Earth and the Sun, which is where the gravitational pull of both the bodies on the satellite is equal to the centripetal force needed to keep the satellite in orbit. These points are like parking spots in space from where a satellite can make observations without expending much fuel. This point between the Earth and the Sun allows an uninterrupted view of the Sun.The mission will carry six scientific payloads that will study the visible surface of the sun (photosphere), the irregular layer over it called the chromosphere, and the layer of plasma called corona that extends for thousands of kilometers and has a temperature of around 6,000 Kelvin (5726.85 degrees Celsius), according to Isro.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/isros-chandrayaan-3-launch-next-year-govt-101616619292766.html
25-03-2021||India||HC again makes -ve Covid report mandatory for Kumbh after CM Rawat scrapped it||Days after Uttarakhand’s new chief minister Tirath Singh rolled back Covid-19 precautions for pilgrims arriving in the state for the Mahakumbh, the state high court on Wednesday directed the government to ensure that the visitors possess negative RT-PCR test reports not older than 72 hours or a vaccination certificate.The order came after a court-appointed team of epidemiologists raised concerns over the mass congregation potentially acting as a superspreader event and the union health ministry warned of the dangers of a mega event if Covid-safety protocols were not followed.Tirath himself, who lost no time in scrapping the requirement for a negative Covid test report put in place by his predecessor, tested positive on Monday, two days after he invited devotees across the world to come to Haridwar for the Mahakumbh saying “nobody will be stopped in the name of Covid-19 as the faith in God will overcome the fear of the Corona virus.” His statement came after a health ministry expert panel recommended several measures to control spread of Covid during Mahakhumb such as an increase in RT-PCR testing capacity and restrictions on people coming from eight states reporting most Covid cases in the country.The high court issued the directions to enforce strict Covid restrictions after state chief secretary Om Prakash on Wednesday gave an undertaking to the court that the condition of the mandatory negative Covid report will be implemented at the festival. The chief secretary’s submission came in response to a report submitted by a court-appointed committee to check arrangements at the Mahakumbh.“Pilgrims will have to comply with the court directions on mandatory testing and vaccination certificates,” Om Prakash told reporters in Dehradun.Between 30 and 50 million pilgrims are expected to visit the shortened month-long festival in April, for which an official notification is yet to be issued. Before the pandemic, over 120 million people were expected to visit a four-month Mahakumbh.The first shahi snan (royal bath) that kicked off the festivities on March 11 saw over 3.3 million people visit Haridwar. Covid cases have been surging across several states, including some that account for a significant number of pilgrims.The high court gave its directions while hearing a bunch of PILs (public interest litigations) on Covid-related issues in the state.On March 5, the court constituted a committee with the mandate to inspect the preparations for the Mahakumbh and submit a report by March 23 with photographic evidence. The team comprised the district judge, Haridwar, the mela adhikari, the petitioner’s counsel Shiv Bhatt and the chief standing counsel. Bhatt said in the report that much of the arrangements were yet to be completed. “We suggested to the court that as some people have completed the vaccination, such pilgrims should also be allowed at the Mahakumbh if they submit a certificate,” Bhatt said.He added the court directed chief secretary Prakash, health secretary Amit Negi, inspector general of police Sanjay Gunjiyal, mela adhikari Deepak Rawat and the petitioner’s counsel (Bhatt himself) to inspect the Mahakumbh area for the following three days and try to address any shortcomings at the earliest. “The court has directed that an interim report based on the action taken after the inspection be submitted by March 30. The next date for hearing the matter has been fixed for March 31,” he said. The Mahakhumb officially starts from April 1.On February 22, the court directed the state government to submit a detailed affidavit by March 3 on its preparations in the light of the standard operating procedures released by the Centre. The court sought details of how many frontline workers had been vaccinated in Haridwar and how much medical staff was available for the Kumbh.The Centre had issued the standard operating procedures on the Mahakumbh in January after the state government approached it for the same on the order of the Uttarakhand high court.The latest court directions came in the wake of new chief minister Tirath Singh Rawat repeatedly saying that there would be no unnecessary restrictions on pilgrims. On March 13, Rawat announced that negative Covid-19 reports were not necessary to participate in the upcoming shahi snans during the mega event.Soon after, Rajesh Bhushan, Union secretary, ministry of health and family welfare, wrote to the Uttarakhand chief secretary to take stringent measures to control the spread of Covid-19 during the Kumbh Mela.Uttarakhand has so far reported 98,646 Covid-19 cases, of which 14,629 cases are from Haridwar district. Currently, Haridwar has the highest active cases among all 13 districts in the state, 351 of a total of 930.The high court noted in its order that “already alarm bells are being rung in some parts of the country, especially from the south, that the Covid-19 pandemic is again raising its head. Therefore, the pandemic continues to be a cause of concern for all of us. Some of the southern and northern states, like Rajasthan, have started imposing a partial lockdown. This is a clear indication that we are again entering the phase where the country will face the Covid-19 pandemic. Therefore, the state government is expected to be vigilant and to ensure that the Mahakumbh mela does not turn into a breeding ground for the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hc-again-makes-ve-covid-report-mandatory-for-kumbh-after-cm-rawat-scrapped-it-101616619306943.html
25-03-2021||India||CJI Bobde designates Justice NV Ramana as his successor||Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde on Wednesday designated the second most senior judge NV Ramana as his successor, putting an end to all speculation around the nomination of the next CJI.According to people familiar with the development, CJI Bobde sent his letter to the union law ministry on Wednesday, exactly a month before his retirement. Justice Bobde retires on April 23 and justice Ramana will take the helm as the 48th CJI the next day.The law ministry , on Friday requested CJI Bobde to designate his successor in accordance with the memorandum of procedure (MoP) for appointment of judges in the Supreme Court.As per the memorandum of procedure, appointment to the office of the Chief Justice of India should be of the senior-most judge of the Supreme Court, considered fit to hold the office. It mentions that the law minister, at the appropriate time, would seek the recommendation of the outgoing CJI for the appointment of the next CJI.It is only when “there is any doubt about the fitness of the senior-most judge to hold the office of the Chief Justice of India”, that the MoP provides, a consultation with other judges as envisaged would be made for appointment of the next CJI.It further states: “After receipt of the recommendation of the CJI, the law minister will put up the recommendation to the prime minister who will advise the President in the matter of appointment.”This, though is usually a formality, which means Ramana, 63, will be the next CJI. He will serve till August 26, 2022.The speculations around appointment of justice Ramana as the next CJI ensued in the wake of a formal complaint against him by Andhra Pradesh chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy, who accused the senior judge of influencing the state high court and stalling investigations into the Amaravati land scam case in which the judge’s daughters were also being probed. Jagan contended in a letter to the CJI that the Andhra Pradesh high court was being used to “destabilise and topple my democratically elected government”.While Jagan submitted a sworn statement in the form of an affidavit after it was asked of him by the CJI for initiating the inquiry, justice Ramana also submitted his statement before the in-house panel in response to the allegations.On Wednesday, the top court closed this inquiry, giving a clean chit to justice Ramana in the episode and clearing the deck for his appointment as the next CJI.A statement posted on the SC website said: “A complaint dated October 6, 2020 sent by the Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh to the Supreme Court was dealt with under the in-house procedure and the same, on due consideration, stands dismissed. It be noted that all the matters dealt with under the In-House Procedure being strictly confidential in nature, are not liable to be made public”.People in the know of developments told HT that the inquiry was closed on Tuesday following which CJI Bobde sent his recommendation to the law ministry for designating justice Ramana as his successor a day after.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cji-bobde-designates-justice-nv-ramana-as-his-successor-101616619324781.html
25-03-2021||India||How bad is the current wave of Covid in India?||The story of India’s Covid-19 battle has changed (for the worse) in the past month. For almost eight months after September, when India’s first wave peaked, the country saw a steady decline in daily cases and deaths -- but a second wave that started mid-February is now undoing months of progress made against the outbreak. How bad is the second wave? Are things as bad as fast as they were during the rise of the first wave? As India races to vaccinate enough people amid fears of mutant strains of the virus, here’s a quick look at how the second wave of infections is playing out.1) This is the sharpest growth in daily cases since May 2020...For the week ending March 23, India reported 42,162 new infections every day on average, the highest the 7-day average has touched since November 28, 2020. Last week, this number was 25,137, indicating the pace of the rise -- 7.7% over the past week. In other words, over the past week, every single day (on average) has seen 7.7% more cases than the day preceding it. How high is it? India hasn’t seen a rate of increase as high in at least 10 months, or since early May 2020 (it was also 7.7% for the week ending May 10).However, a key difference from then is that the base at the time was very low compared to what it is now – the 7-day average of new cases on May 10, 2020 was 3,508, against 42,162 on March 23 Indeed, India’s case trajectory has gone from 20,000 to 42,000 in just 11 days , 10 days fewer than the 21 days it took to go from 20,000-to-42,000 during the first wave (between July 3 and July 24).2) ... and also daily deathsOn average, 199 people have lost their lives to Covid-19 every day in the past week , the highest the death rate has been since the week ending January 13, 2021. A week ago, on average 140 people were dying every day. This pegs the average growth rate of deaths at 5.1%. This is the highest growth rate of deaths since the week ending June 22, 2020. However, deaths were artificially inflated that week because Delhi and Maharashtra both reconciled their Covid deaths on July 16, adding more than 1500 deaths to their tallies in a single day.If we exclude numbers from that week, then the last time India saw a growth rate higher than 5.1% in deaths was (again) for week ending May 10, when the death rate was rising 5.8%.3) At the current rate, India’s wave will overtake the US’s by March 27 and Brazil’s by April 2Currently, Brazil is the biggest Covid hot spot in the world – reporting an average of 75,570 new cases every day on average. Next is the US, which is, on average reported 54,141 new infections of Covid-19 every day in the past week. With a seven-day average of new cases at 42,162, India is at the third spot. However, India’s cases are rising at a far faster pace than the first two. In fact, the case rate of the US is currently declining. In the past week, the US’s daily case rate has dropped by 0.2%. While Brazil’s case rate is rising, it is doing so at a much slower pace than India’s – 1.4% against India’s 7.7% average growth in the past week.If these countries maintain this growth rate (or in the US’s case, decline rate) in the near future, then India’s trajectory of daily cases is set overtake the US in just four days (by March 27) and Brazil in 10 days, or by April 2.4) Are fewer people dying in the second wave?Some number crunchers have claimed as much. Overall, of the 11,554,894 people infected across the country, 159,615 people lost their lives to Covid-19 till Tuesday night (March 23). This places the country’s case fatality rate (CFR) at 1.4%. However, in the initial months of the outbreak, a larger proportion of people were dying as doctors took time narrow down on effective treatments, and the health infrastructure was in the process of being strengthened. As a result, India’s CFR has steadily been improving – it was 3% till the end of June; it improved to 1.6% by the end of September. In the last six months, only 1.1% of cases have resulted in deaths. In order to see if the second wave has had a lower death rate, we plotted the seven-day average of deaths (with a 14-day lag) against the seven-day average of cases since October 1, 2020 at a ratio of 0.011:1 (as the CFR since October is 1.1%). The 14-day lag was taken because a February 2020 study showed that it took an average of 14 days from infection to death. This plot shows that the death trajectory is nearly identical to the case trajectory in the second wave, which means that so far there has been no major deviation from the 1.1% death rate.Put otherwise, it means there is no change in the case fatality rate between October and now, although, to be sure, this proportion is lower than how many people have died from the disease overall (CFR of 1.4%) and also lower than the proportion of people who died till September 2020 (1.6%).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/how-bad-is-the-current-wave-of-covid-in-india-101616618515506.html
25-03-2021||India||Congress leader Harish Rawat, 4 family members test positive for Covid-19||Former Uttarakhand chief minister and senior Congress leader Harish Rawat has tested positive for Covid-19. Four members of his family have also tested positive Rawat shared this development on his Twitter handle on Wednesday in Hindi. Rawat tweeted, “Finally Corona pahalwan (wrestler) has gripped me. During noontime, today, decided to get my wife, daughter, Sumit Rawat, Puran Rawat, tested. I was hesitant to get myself tested. Then I thought I should also get tested, and it was the right thing that I did.” Rawat further tweeted, “I got myself tested. My test report came positive and four members of my family have also tested positive. Those who have come into my contact till noon today should kindly get themselves tested as this caution is a must.” With elections approaching, many in his party are projecting him as the chief ministerial candidate, Rawat has been busy attending various public functions and meeting people in different parts of the state. On Monday, Uttarakhand chief minister Tirath Singh Rawat had tested positive for Covid-19. He also had shared the development on his Twitter handle, tweeting, “My Coronavirus test report has come positive. I am fine and not facing any difficulty. I have isolated myself under the monitoring of doctors. Those of you who have come into contact with me in the last few days, should be cautious and get their tests done. I wish good health to all.” In December last year, the then chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat had also tested positive for Covid-19 and isolated himself at his residence. Rawat had also shared the development on his Twitter handle. Uttarakhand has so far reported 98,646 Covid-19 cases, of which 14,629 cases are from Haridwar district. There has been an increase in cases in the last few weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-leader-harish-rawat-4-family-members-test-positive-for-covid19-101616617398925.html
25-03-2021||India||50 can pray in Nizamuddin Markaz during Shab-e-Barat, Centre tells HC||The Centre on Wednesday told the Delhi high court that 50 people chosen by the state wakf board can be permitted to offer prayers at the mosque in the Nizamuddin Markaz on the occasion of Shab-e-Barat once the names of those individuals are provided to the station house officer of the local police station.The submission was made during the hearing on a plea by the Delhi Wakf Board through advocate Wajeeh Shafiq, seeking opening of the Nizamuddin Markaz where a Tablighi Jamaat congregation was held amid the Covid-19 pandemic. It was locked down by the authorities on March 31 last year, after removing members of the Jamaat who were staying there in violation of the curbs imposed to stop the spread of the infectious disease.An FIR was registered under the Epidemic Diseases Act, the Disaster Management Act, Foreigners Act and various provisions of the penal code in connection with the Tablighi Jamaat event held at the Markaz and the subsequent stay of foreigners there during the Covid-19 lockdown.Representing the Centre, advocate Rajat Nair told Justice Mukta Gupta that if the Delhi Wakf Board seeks permission from the SHO for 50 people, they may be allowed to enter the Masjid Bangle Wali to offer prayers on the occasion of Shab-e- Barat, which will be observed on March 28-29.Senior advocate Ramesh Gupta, who was representing the petitioner, urged the court to permit some individuals to pray at the mosque and assured that the adjacent madrasa will not be accessed.Gupta also urged the court to decide on the opening of the mosque before the month of Ramzan commences from April 13 “as more people would want to offer prayers at the mosque during that time”. The court listed the matter for further hearing on April 12.The wakf board, in its plea, has contended that even after Unlock-1 guidelines permitted religious places outside containment zones to be opened, the Markaz -- comprising the Masjid Bangley Wali, Madarsa Kashif-ul-uloom and a hostel -- continues to be locked up.It has further argued that even if the premises were a part of any criminal investigation or trial, keeping it “under lock as an out of bound area” was a “primitive method” of enquiry process.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/50-can-pray-in-nizamuddin-markaz-during-shab-e-barat-centre-tells-hc-101616610649363.html
25-03-2021||India||SC asks Param Bir Singh to move Bombay HC||New Delhi The Supreme Court on Wednesday commented that it was all “hunky-dory” between former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh and Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh for a long time before they fell out, and asked Singh to approach the Bombay high court for a Central Bureau of Investigation probe against Deshmukh for allegedly running a “money collection scheme” through the police, the subject of a plea by the former top cop in the apex court. The move provides a temporary respite to both Deshmukh and the state government, which has rallied behind the home minister despite vocal calls for his resignation from several quarters, most notably the opposition Bharatija Janata Party. Singh was transferred to a low-key post in Mumbai Police’s home guards on March 17 over his mishandling of a case where explosives were found in an abandoned vehicle outside billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s residence Antilia and the subsequent arrest of suspended police officer Sachin Vaze in the case. On Wednesday, a bench of justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and R Subhas Reddy declined to entertain Singh’s petition in the first instance, recording in its order that the high court had wider powers under Article 226 (writ jurisdiction) and that it could also examine the need for a probe by a central agency. “We have no doubt that the matter is quite serious and affects the administration at large. It also appears that a lot of material which has come in (the) public domain is a consequence of the personae falling out,” noted the court in its order, as it further took note that the high court could also examine an August 2020 report by former commissioner of state intelligence Rashmi Shukla regarding corruption and the involvement of middlemen in police postings in Maharashtra. “Concerned parties have been hunky-dory for a long period and now they have fallen apart...Here is an issue relating to two personae till the time it erupted in the public glare. One person moved out and then they started saying something against each other. The question for you is why not go to the high court under Article 226?” the bench asked senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, who represented Singh. Rohatgi sought to persuade the bench by listing out several cases, including the Hathras rape and murder case from Uttar Pradesh, in which the Supreme Court directly entertained writ petitions and passed orders. He added that Singh’s petition raised matters of great public interest affecting the citizens of the country. “Agreed, we also note and record that it is a serious issue. But why should the high court not do it under Article 226? You want investigation by an independent agency and that also can be done by the high court. You (Singh) are a directly affected person. You should go to the high court first,” justice Kaul told Rohatgi. The bench also pointed out that Singh has not made Deshmukh a party to his petition despite making a spate of accusations against the home minister. When Rohatgi said that this was a case of political interference in the police department in violation of the Supreme Court ruling in the Prakash Singh case of 2006 that sought to insulate the police machinery, justice Kaul retorted: “Has any state enforced Prakash Singh? No state wants to let go of its power. No reform has taken place despite Prakash Singh and as soon as an episode happens, everyone remembers our judgments.” The court added: “In our view, this is only a mantra recited periodically, wherever the occasion so suits, and there has been no seriousness by all concerned to ever implement the directions enshrined in the judgment.” Rohatgi then opted to withdraw the petition with the liberty to urgently move the Bombay high court and seek a hearing. “I will approach the high court today afternoon itself. I will also request the high court for a hearing on Thursday,” Rohatgi told the bench. He also urged the Supreme Court to record that the high court should take up the case on Thursday since CCTV footage from Deshmukh’s residence was not being handed over to the NIA (National Investigation Agency) by the ATS (anti-terrorism squad) and that Singh apprehended that the evidence of meetings between Deshmukh and Vaze could be destroyed. Justice Kaul, however, told Rohatgi that as a matter of principle, his bench did not fix dates of hearing before the high courts since they were also constitutional courts and must be allowed to decide such housekeeping issues on their own. The bench then disposed of the matter and added Deshmukh and the NIA as parties to Singh’s petition on Rohatgi’s request. Solicitor General Tushar Mehta remained present during the proceedings on behalf of the central government and CBI but did not make any submission as the matter was sent to the high court. In his petition before the top court, Singh said he was transferred to home guards “immediately” after he brought the corrupt practices of Deshmukh to the knowledge of Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar and some other senior leaders in the state government. The petition contended that NCP leader Deshmukh held various meetings in February 2021 at his residence with police officers, including Sachin Vaze of the Crime Intelligence Unit, Mumbai, and Sanjay Patil, ACP (Social Service Branch), Mumbai, bypassing their seniors, and asked them to collect ₹100 crore every month from establishments such as bars, hookah parlours and restaurants. Singh submitted he was being made a “scapegoat to divert attention” in the Antilia case, highlighting that while there were vertically five officers between him and Vaze, Deshmukh was the one meeting Vaze at his residence. In that case, now being investigated by NIA, Vaze has already been arrested. The state ATS has also named Vaze the main accused in the death of Mansukh Hiran who was in possession of the vehicle found with the explosives, but reported it stolen a few days before the incident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-asks-param-bir-singh-to-move-bombay-hc-101616612838841.html
25-03-2021||India||EC supports electoral bonds in apex court, calls for transparency||The Election Commission on Wednesday told the Supreme Court that it supports the existing system of political party funding through electoral bonds, although it added that it would like the process to be more transparent, a concern that it said could be considered later.The submission of the poll body came at a crucial juncture during the court’s hearing of a plea moved by NGO Association for Democratic Reforms seeking stay on sale of electoral bonds from April 1 to 10 ahead of the Assembly elections in West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Assam and union territory of Puducherry.Senior advocate Rakesh Dwivedi appearing for EC said, “The Commission is supporting electoral bonds and not opposing it. If we don’t support it we will go into a pre-existing system of receiving donations through cash. Electoral bonds goes one step forward as all bonds have to be obtained from the bank only. This way there is accountability. But we are also asking for transparency. That can be considered later by the Court.”The EC’s reference to transparency is significant because currently, electoral bonds promise anonymity, with only the issuing bank, the state-owned State Bank of India being aware of the identity of the purchaser. Electoral bonds were notified by the government in January 2018 and were first issued in March 2018. A three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde recorded the submission of EC and reserved orders on the application filed by ADR. While doing so, the Court raised an apprehension of a possible misuse of these bonds and the mechanism available with the Centre to remedy the situation. To be sure, this was not the main objection of the petitioner -- who was objecting to the very use of the bonds, not their misuse. The bench, also comprising Justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian said, “What if a political party has got ₹100 crore worth bonds and it intends to finance protests? What is the control that the Government has on the use of this money by parties for terrorist purposes, illegal activities or for purposes outside their political agenda? ”Attorney General KK Venugopal appearing for Centre referred to certain checks and balances. He said that parties are required to file their income tax returns each year showing how they have expended the money. The political party can face deregistration if it is found to indulge in anti-national or illegal activities. Venugopal said that the use of bonds is essential for the country as it has curbed black money being used in elections.For the petitioner, advocate Prashant Bhushan submitted that there was complete anonymity about who purchases these bonds and to whom it is subsequently transferred. He read out an earlier affidavit filed by Election Commission in March 2019 where it raised concerns over lack of transparency in tracking political party donations.Although the petition by ADR was filed in Supreme Court in September 2017, arguments have not concluded and from time to time, the NGO has approached the Supreme Court to stall issuance of these bonds till the matter is finally decided. Bhushan said that during the proceedings of this case, the Supreme Court in April 2019 directed political parties to submit receipts of electoral bonds in a sealed cover to the Election Commission. On Wednesday, EC told the court that all major political parties had filed their receipts.Bhushan said that even this would not help as EC would not know the identity of the donor. “Why should there be anonymous funding to political parties when past judgments of the Supreme Court have held that transparency in elections is a right of voters not under the Right to Information Act but as a matter of right in a democracy?” Bhushan asked, Venugopal said that bonds cannot be subsequently traded. The process follows KYC norms and anonymity of the donors is maintained in order to prevent their victimization, he explained.The electoral bonds system was introduced by way of a money bill introducing amendments in the Finance Act and the Representation of Peoples Act. ADR claimed that such anonymous route of funding amounted to legitimizing bribery as corporate could fund the party in power in a state or Centre as a matter of quid pro quo. These donations enjoy 100% tax exemption and even foreign companies can donate through Indian subsidiaries, the petition added. “The Electoral Bonds Scheme has opened the floodgates to unlimited corporate donations to political parties and anonymous financing by Indian as well as foreign companies which can have serious repercussions on the Indian democracy,” the application filed by ADR stated, adding that the Finance Act of 2017 exempts contributions by way of electoral bonds to be disclosed to the EC under Section 29C of the Representation of Peoples Act.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ec-supports-electoral-bonds-in-apex-court-calls-for-transparency-101616612838300.html
25-03-2021||India||TMC hits out at BJP’s Bengal unit chief for ‘Bermuda shorts’ remark||Kolkata: The Bharatiya Janata Party’s Bengal unit president Dilip Ghosh on Wednesday came under attack from the ruling Trinamool Congress for suggesting that chief minister Mamata Banerjee should wear Bermuda shorts to display injuries sustained on her leg during campaigning for the upcoming polls.The TMC shared a 14-second video of Ghosh addressing a rally in the state’s Purulia district on WHEN on its official Twitter handle. “Such distasteful remark is expected of Dilip Babu and nobody else. A remark against a woman chief minister proves that the BJP does not respect women. The mothers and sisters of Bengal will give a befitting reply on May 2,” the TMC tweeted while tagging Ghosh’s and Bengal BJP’s Twitter handles. In the video, the BJP leader could be heard saying, “Her plaster was replaced with crepe bandage. But she is still showing her leg to everyone. She is wearing her saree in such a way that one leg is visible while the other is not. I have never seen anyone wearing a saree like this. If she has to show her leg then she can wear Bermudas so that people can see clearly.” The CM sustained injuries on her leg during a roadshow in East Midnapore’s Nandigram on March 10. While the TMC has alleged that it was a deliberate attack on Banerjee, the EC ruled out any conspiracy. Banerjee is contesting against her former protégé Suvendu Adhikari, who recently joined the BJP.Hitting out at the BJP leader, TMC MP Mahua Moitra tweeted, “@BJP WB Pres asks in public meeting why Mamatadi is wearing a saree, she should be wearing “Bermuda” shorts to display her leg better. And these perverted depraved monkeys think they are going to win Bengal?”The BJP, however, said that Ghosh’s statement was being misinterpreted. “A lot of remarks are made during election campaigns. Ghosh’s statement is being taken in a wrong way. Nobody has any intention to insult the chief minister,” BJP’s Bengal unit spokesperson Samik Bhattacharya said.The state goes to polls in eight-phases beginning March 27. The counting of votes will be held on May 2.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tmchits-out-at-bjp-s-bengal-unit-chief-for-bermuda-shorts-remark-101616612837696.html
25-03-2021||India||BJP offers a ‘love jihad’ law in Kerala manifesto||Thiruvananthapuram: A legislation to protect customs of Sabarimala hill temple and a special law to contain ‘love jihad’ feature in the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led National Democratic Alliance’s manifesto, released by Union environment minister Prakash Javadekar here on Wednesday, for the April 6 assembly elections in Kerala. The manifesto also promises free laptops for students and free cooking gas cylinders to economically weaker sections. Releasing the NDA’s manifesto -- which is full of sops, just like in the manifestoes released by the ruling Left Democratic Front and opposition Congress-led United Democratic Front — the Union minister termed it “progressive, dynamic and development-oriented”. “Unlike our opponents we only promise that we can do. We will take Kerala out of stagnation,” he said.Some of the promises made in the manifesto include free housing, drinking water and power connections to all. It also promises six free cooking gas cylinders to economically weaker sections and free laptops to school students. A pension ₹5,000 per month is promised to the family if the main bread-earner falls sick or is unable to work. The manifesto also promises free title deeds of land to the landless among SC&ST communities. Javadekar said time has come to stop alternating between the LDF and UDF in the state, adding that there was enough scope for a third front this time. “The state suffered due to alternating power equations but this time people are looking for a change,” Javadekar said.Other highlights of the manifesto include welfare pension to be raised to ₹3,500 per month, a strict ban on the ‘Nokku Kooli’ and ‘Attimari Kooli’ (militant trade union practices in Kerala). It also promises to do away with the eligibility test prior to the main public service commission examination, besides restructuring Kerala Infrastructure Development Fund in line with constitutional provisions and be subjected to audit of theComptroller and Auditor General. The manifesto said that all temples in the state should be taken out of the control of thestate government and be entrusted with believers, priests and religious leaders. The manifesto added that a special legislation will be brought in to protect the age-old customs of Sabarimala temple, which witnessed unrest three years ago when the government tried to implement the Supreme Court judgment removing bar on women of child-bearing age from entering the temple. Similarly, a special law will be introduced on the lines of BJP-ruled states in north India to contain ‘love jihad,’ an alleged practice of enticing Hindu girls feigning love and later converting them. The term was first coined in the state after 21 people from north Kerala disappeared in 2016 and later believed to have joined the Islamic State in Syria. Among missing three women and two men were converts from other religions. “In Kerala, many central programmes have been hijacked by the Left regime, which present them to people making slight changes. Most of the programmes are named differently to fool people,” the minister said. Taking a jibe at the UDF and LDF, Javadekar said that in Kerala, the Congress and the Communist Party of India (Marxist) were sworn enemies, but the two are friends in West Bengal. “It is hypocrisy: ‘Bengal mei dosti, Kerala mei kushti’,” he said. “During the last Lok Sabha polls also, the BJP made big promises on Sabarimala. But it failed to do anything in two years. Even a school child knows the issue is before the Supreme Court. It is fooling believers,” said CPI(M) leader A Ananthan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-offers-a-love-jihad-law-in-kerala-manifesto-101616612777714.html
25-03-2021||India||Shah promises action as row over nuns’ harassment in UP intensifies||Kochi:Union home minister Amit Shah on Wednesday assured action in the alleged attack on nuns by a group of Bajrang Dal activists on a train in Uttar Pradesh’s Jhansi soon after Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan said that such incidents tarnish the image of the nation. Shah was speaking at a poll rally in Kochi ahead of the April 6 state elections. “Those involved in the Jhansi nuns’ harassment incident will be brought before the law. I want to assure the people of Kerala that the culprits behind this incident will be brought to justice at the earliest,” he said. In a detailed statement on Tuesday, the church media commission said that the nuns, from a congregation of Kerala-based Syro-Malabar Church, and a group of girls were on their way from Delhi to Odisha in a train on March 19 for Easter celebrations when they were confronted by the Bajrang Dal activists in Jhansi. The church said that the nuns were verbally abused and activists tried to attack the girls, whom they believed, were being taken away for religious conversion.While the Kerala Catholic Bishops Conference (KCBC) and Syro-Malabar Church have sought action against the alleged attackers, Vijayan in a letter to Shah sought strict action against those “who disrupt and impair the freedom of individual rights” guaranteed by the Constitution.The CM said the nuns and the postulants were forcefully removed from the train by the police following a complaint from the Bajrang Dal activists alleging that the two girls were being taken for forceful religious conversion.“You would agree with me that such incidents tarnish the image of the nation and its ancient tradition of religious tolerance and practice. Such incidents require utmost condemnation by the Union Government,” Vijayan said.What happened in Uttar Pradesh should not have happened in the country and it is a “very serious matter,” the CM said, attacking the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party in UP. “Violence in the name of religion is on the rise in many parts of our country. Violence against women and marginalized groups are on the rise…Uttar Pradesh is notorious for such matters. All such illegal activities are taking place under the ruling BJP government there. It should also be taken seriously that all this is happening on an uncontrolled scale,” Vijayan said.The incident occurred at a time when the BJP is wooing Christian minorities who form 16% of the votebank to get a foothold in the central Travancore area.At the rally in Kochi, Shah accused Vijayan of having close links with the prime accused in the gold smuggling case. “Who appointed the principal secretary who was arrested in money laundering and smuggling cases? Why was he sacked later? The CM can’t wash away his hands like this. Did the secretary and CM travel abroad with the main accused or not,” Shah said.Without naming the prime accused in the case, Swapna Suresh and M Sivasankar, who were arrested by central agencies in connection with case, the Union minister asked, “Why did the accused woman come to the CM’s residence regularly? Who appointed her in a key post with ₹3 lakh salary? Did the accused make foreign trips with state fund with the permission of the state government.”Justifying the investigation by central agencies in the case, he said if any scandal took place in the country, it will be probed by the Indian agencies and not those from the UN.Last week, the state government booked officials of the Enforcement Directorate for allegedly trying to implicate the CM in the gold smuggling case. Shah said the people of the state see BJP as an alternative for the opposition UDF and ruling LDF.Addressing a road show in Tripunithara on the outskirts of Kochi, Shah said also targeted the LDF government for its handling of the Sabarimala temple issue in 2018. “It is not easy for believers to forget the way the government trampled their customs and jailed thousands of them. The government is answerable to faithful for its various criminal acts at the holy shrine,” he said. During the three-month long annual pilgrimage season in 2018, the Kerala witnessed large-scale violence when the state government tried to enforce the Supreme Court verdict annulling a decades-old bar on the entry of women of child-bearing age to the Sabarimala temple. Nearly a dozen women in the age group of 10-50 were stopped from entering the temple. “It is time to bring a change in Kerala. Senior bureaucrats such as E Sreedharan are also joining the BJP because they know only the BJP can help develop Kerala further under the leadership of PM Modi. LDF-UDF cannot,” he said.The senior BJP leader also hit out Congress’s Wayanad MP Rahul Gandhi, calling his frequent visits to the state “picnic trips”. “In Kerala he talks against left but in West Bengal both are thick friends and fighting elections together. Congress has no qualms in aligning with the Muslim League in Kerala and Shiv Sena in Maharashtra,” he said.

25-03-2021||India||BJP is committed to ensuring error-free NRC: Sarbanand Sonowal||Guwahati: Assam chief minister Sarbanands Sonowal is confident that his government’s performance will ensure it will return to power with an improved tally in the upcoming assembly elections. He believes the unrest over the discrepancies in the National Register of Citizens (NRC), and the opposition to the implementation of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, or CAA, have died down, and the concerns that still exist in some pockets will not adversely affect the BJP’s poll prospects.In an interview to HT, Sonowal, popularly known as the “jatiya nayak” (community hero) for his activism as a student leader with the All Assam Students Union and for the role he played in getting the Illegal Migrants Determination by Tribunal Act repealed by the Supreme Court in 2005, said the BJP is fighting to persevere Assamese identity and ensure freedom from the threats posed by illegal intruders.Edited excerpts:Why does the performance of your government give you the confidence of returning to power?Our idea is to protect the people of Assam. We want to make a self-reliant Assam, and in the last five years, we’ve worked with honesty. We gave everyone a chance to move ahead and live with dignity; everybody’s rights were protected; all communities were brought together. Peace and security have been strengthened on the ground. We have ensured a corruption-free administration, and restored the people’s faith in the government. For example, two members of the Assam Pubic Service Commission are still in jail for taking money for appointments. When the Congress was in power, students were in a bad state; they used to tell their parents that even if we complete studies, we don’t have the money [to pay bribes] for jobs. Today, all jobs are provided on merit. This transparency and accountability is our victory.In the next five years, we want to take Assam to greater heights. The people of the state are happy, and they want to bring back the BJP government so that they can get more benefits.In your manifesto, you have promised 100,000 government jobs by March 2022, and another 800,000 in the private sector. The 2020 government estimates pegged the unemployment rate at 11%-12%. How are you going to provide these jobs?Jobs will be created in all the sectors, particularly the petroleum sector, agriculture, and the veterinary sectors. We have a scheme called the Chief Minister’s Samagra Gram Unnayan Yojana. Under this scheme, we have started work in eight mission modes. There is a lot of scope for generating jobs in many areas. (The scheme aims to double farm incomes and to offer livelihood, logistical assistance, and community support).The BJP is up against an opposition coalition that has the Congress and the AIUDF. How will this alliance impact the elections, especially in the Barrack valley?One has to first look at how the AIUDF emerged. People know how the Congress ruled the state, and how it allowed intruders space to create its own vote bank. During the anti-intruders agitation, (Assam Movement) over 800 people who were protesting were killed. They (Congress government) even brought the brought the Illegal Migrants Determination by Tribunal Act, 1983 to protect illegal intruders. We fought a legal battle, and after the Supreme Court stayed that order, Ajmal emerged. Fourteen fundamental groups came together to save illegal intruders -- that is how the AIUDF came into existence. What do the people make of this alliance? What does it signal? It is clear that if they come to power, they will threaten Indian people in Assam and give space to illegal entrants. We call their alliance an unholy one because anyone who protects illegal intruders cannot have the best interest of the country at heart. That is why people in the state don’t want to make them win.How will the BJP face the opposition to CAA and NRC? You have also mentioned the need for a corrected NRC -- will that assuage concerns ?There were many factual errors in the list ; the state government has decided that only Indian citizens should be in the list. We are committed to making an error-free NRC. As far as CAA is concerned, there is no concern anymore; people were misled into believing that it will disenfranchise millions, but none of that has happened. The Congress, by saying it will not allow its implementation, are engaging in doublespeak. Our leadership has already said its a central law that will be implemented.The condition of tea garden workers has become a talking point in these elections. Rahul Gandhi needs to answer this: what are the real problems of the people who work in the tea gardens? Look at the changes we have brought about in the last five years;we’ve made roads, provided water and power, and started providing money from central and state government schemes through DBT (direct benefit transfer). We have hiked the wages, apart from providing facilities for health and education. Self-help groups for women have been offered financial assistance; there are scholarships for students. Can the Congress give an account of what they did during their rule? People never saw the Congress leadership here in times of need, whether it was during the floods or the pandemic. What impact will the newer political formations -- the Asom Jatiya Parishad (AJP) and the Raijor Dal, which are being seen as a anti-BJP -- have on you vote share?They will not have any impact on the ground. Their network is not strong. People have seen the BJP perform; why will they put their faith in newer political parties that have just emerged?There is speculation of a tussle between you and Himanta Biswa Sarma for the CM’s post.This is a media creation. My interest is to have a BJP government in Assam. I am a committed party person, and want the party to come to power. We work as a team, and the stories of our tussle are made up by the media.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-is-committed-to-ensuring-error-free-nrc-sarbanand-sonowal-101616612717728.html
25-03-2021||India||PM fires fresh salvos at Mamata, Cong-AIUDF||Silchar/Kolkata With just a few days left for the polls to begin, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday stepped up his attack on political opponents as he cautioned the people against the Congress-AIUDF ‘Mahajoth’ (alliance) in Assam and conveyed to West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee that no Indian was an “outsider” in the state.Polling, which is slated to begin from March 27, will be held in three phases for 126-member Assembly in Assam and in eight-phases for 294 seats in West Bengal.Targeting the Congress at an election rally in Assam’s Silchar, Modi said that the Grand Old Party did not have any ideals or able leaders. “Congress ke paas na neta hai na niti, sirf Mahajhoot hai (Congress neither has a leader nor ideals, it only has a grand lie),” he told the crowd.The Congress in the state has tied up with the All India United Democratic Front, Bodo People’s Front, Communist Party of India, Communist Party of India (Marxist), Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist), Rashtriya Janata Dal and Anchalik Gana Morcha to fight the polls.Accusing the party of going to any extent to win the elections, Modi said: “I have come to awaken you to the fact that Congress’s hand is with those forces that are a danger to the state’s identity and culture.” The Prime Minister claimed that it was the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) that helped Assam get rid of the violence that, he claimed, was common during the Congress regime. “Look at West Bengal today… there are news of violence every day. Assam was going through a similar situation during the Congress’ rule. In the 2016 assembly election, the people of Assam chose BJP with a hope that this will bring peace with development. Today, there is a flow of development in every part which has helped us restore peace in the state,” he said. “The Congress has always taken sides of infiltrators and illegal migrants while the BJP wants to protect the original indigenous people of this land. I appeal to the people of Assam to reject Congress for the lies and choose BJP for development to protect the pride of this state,” he added. While campaigning for the saffron party in West Bengal later in the day, the Prime Minister lashed out at the chief minister over her “bohiragoto” (outsider) remark, saying that nobody can be called an outsider in a land where icons such as Rabindranath Tagore, Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay and Subhas Chandra Bose talked about unity and one nation. “You call me an outsider? This is the land where Gurudev wrote Punjab Sindhu Gujarat Maratha Dravida Utkal Banga…..No Indian is an outsider here. We are all Indians,” Modi said in Bengali in East Midnapore’s Contai area.“Bengal brought together the people of India through Vande Mataram, and on that land, Mamata-didi is talking about ‘bohiragoto’. No Indian is an outsider here, they are the children of Bharat Mata,” he added.The ruling Trinamool Congress has been describing the BJP as “a party of outsiders” as a strategy in the West Bengal assembly election. Banerjee has regularly asserted that she won’t allow the state to be ruled by “outsiders” from Delhi or Gujarat, in a reference to the BJP and the prime minister.Modi also said that a son of the soil would be appointed as the chief minister if the party was voted to power. Besides this, he also accused the chief minister of insulting the people of Nandigram through allegations of an attack on March 10 that left her with an injury on her leg. “You are maligning the people of Nandigram before the country. The people of Nandigram will not forgive you. They will give you a befitting reply,” Modi said. Banerjee, meanwhile, accused the BJP of cash distribution to seize votes. “They are bringing a lot of money. Keep your eyes open. If you can catch someone red-handed you will be awarded with a job,” she told a rally in Bankura district.The TMC also approached the State’s Chief Electoral Officer, accusing the BJP of misusing government infrastructure for political campaigns in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-fires-fresh-salvos-at-mamata-congaiudf-101616612657682.html
25-03-2021||India||K’taka boy lynched over suspicion of theft||Bengaluru: A 10-year-old boy succumbed to his injuries seven days after he was beaten up by four people for allegedly stealing snacks from a grocery store in Uppanashi in Karnataka’s Haveri district, police said on Wednesday. According to the police and the boy's family members, the boy was allegedly held captive on March 16 for several hours, beatenup by the owners of the shop, and released only after his mother pleaded with them. Later that night, when the boy’s condition worsened, he was rushed to a hospital in Haveri, from where the doctors referred him to Kempegowda Institute of Medical Sciences (KIMS) in Hubballi, where he died on Tuesday.The post-mortem examination report is still awaited, a KIMS spokesperson said. A second official at the hospital said on condition of anonymity said that boy developed a fever while undergoing treatment, and died due to brain haemorrhage. What led to this will only be found in the post-mortem report, he added. A case of murder, wrongful restraint, and assault, was registered on Tuesday against four people -- shopkeeper Pavan Karishettar, his mother Basavannevva Karishettar, his uncle Kumar Haveri, and his maternal grandfather Shivarudrappa Haveri. They are all absconding, police said. In a video shot at the hospital before this death, the boy named the four people, and recounted what happened during his alleged captivity. He said that he was first locked up in a room. After a while, the old woman (Basavannevva) in the house took him out of the room and made him sit outside. “An old man came and hit me twice. He asked me not to move from there. Then, the shopkeeper came and took me to the backyard, where two others joined. They hit me on my legs, neck, and legs. Pawan made me bend down and hit me with a stone,” he said. The statement has been recorded by the police. According to the police complaint lodged on March 17by the boy’s father, Nagayya Hiremath, their son was sent to the store to buy some groceries. When he did not return home for over two hours, Hiremath went to the store. He found that the boy was in the shopkeepers’ custody, and was being beaten on the suspicion of the theft. He requested the shopkeeperto release the boy, but Pavan Karishettar told Hiremath that he wanted to teach him a lesson. At around 3pm, the boy’s mother went to the shop and pleaded with him, but the owners firstasked her to come back at 5pm. Only after she fought and pleaded with the shopkeepers, did they release the boy, the complaint said. Rani Hiremath, a relative of the boy’s family, said that police did not register an FIR on March 17. She said they just took a written statement from the boy’s father. When asked about this particular complaint, SP Devaraju said he would “look into the allegation”.According to the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), there were 94 instances involving the murder of children, and 107 children were killed in 2019. Sabhiya Saldana, a Bengaluru-based child rights activists said that the police not filing an FIR on the day of the incident was a matter of concern. “Filing an FIR only after the child has died means the police did not take assault seriously,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ktaka-boy-lynched-over-suspicion-of-theft-101616611878279.html
25-03-2021||India||Isro’s Chandrayaan-3 launch next yr: Govt||New Delhi: The Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) plans to launch its third mission to the Moon next year, the government said on Wednesday. In a written response to a question in the Lok Sabha, minister of state for the department of space, Jitendra Singh, said that the Chandrayaan-3 mission will carry only a lander and a rover.The space agency earlier planned to launch the Chandrayaan 3 mission either in late 2020 or early 2021. However, most missions were rescheduled due to the Covid-19 pandemic.“The integrated spacecraft is being realised for planned launch during 2022,” Singh said, adding that the spacecraft is in “advanced stages” of realisation, with the propulsion system already built and undergoing tests. The lander structure has also been built and is currently being fitted with its propulsion system, he said.India’s second mission to the Moon, Chandrayaan-2, lost contact with Earth just 2.1km away from the surface of the Moon in 2019. While the lander, Vikram, made a hard landing on the lunar surface, the orbiter is expected to remain in position for seven years.“There was a problem at the very last leg of the journey of the lander. For the third mission, we have to ensure -- one, there is no problems with the thrusters; two, the system is fault tolerant so that even if there is some issue, for example thrusters not working, the system can automatically course correct; three, we have to ensure that the Chandrayaan-2 orbiter communicates with the lander throughout the powered decent because it is capable of giving last-minute commands if necessary,” said Dr M Annadurai, former director of the Isro satellite centre in Bangaluru.The Vikram lander and Pragyan rover aboard the Chandrayaan-2 were to land near the lunar south pole, where the mission was expected to observe water molecules frozen in the darker regions of the Moon. This year, Isro has planned two missions in December – the first unmanned flight under the Gaganyaan mission, and India’s first solar mission. The unmanned flight will bring India’s human spaceflight programme one step closer to sending humans to low earth orbit; the final mission will be undertaken after a successful second unmanned flight scheduled for next year. The solar mission, Aditya L1, will see the space agency send a satellite 1.5 million kilometres away to the Lagrangian point, between the Earth and the Sun, which is where the gravitational pull of both the bodies on the satellite is equal to the centripetal force needed to keep the satellite in orbit. These points are like parking spots in space from where a satellite can make observations without expending much fuel. This point between the Earth and the Sun allows an uninterrupted view of the Sun.

25-03-2021||India||HC again makes-ve Covid report mandatory for Kumbh after CM Rawat scrapped it||Days after Uttarakhand’s new chief minister Tirath Singh rolled back Covid-19 precautions for pilgrims arriving in the state for the Mahakumbh, the state high court on Wednesday directed the government to ensure that the visitors possess negative RT-PCR test reports not older than 72 hours or a vaccination certificate.The order came after a court-appointed team of epidemiologists raised concerns over the mass congregation potentially acting as a superspreader event and the union health ministry warned of the dangers of a mega event if Covid-safety protocols were not followed. Tirath himself, who lost no time in scrapping the requirement for a negative Covid test report put in place by his predecessor, tested positive on Monday, two days after he invited devotees across the world to come to Haridwar for the Mahakumbh saying “nobody will be stopped in the name of Covid-19 as the faith in God will overcome the fear of the Corona virus.” His statement came after a health ministry expert panel recommended several measures to control spread of Covid during Mahakhumb such as an increase in RT-PCR testing capacity and restrictions on people coming from eight states reporting most Covid cases in the country.The high court issued the directions to enforce strict Covid restrictions after state chief secretary Om Prakash on Wednesday gave an undertaking to the court that the condition of the mandatory negative Covid report will be implemented at the festival. The chief secretary’s submission came in response to a report submitted by a court-appointed committee to check arrangements at the Mahakumbh. “Pilgrims will have to comply with the court directions on mandatory testing and vaccination certificates,” Om Prakash told reporters in Dehradun. Between 30 and 50 million pilgrims are expected to visit the shortened month-long festival in April, for which an official notification is yet to be issued. Before the pandemic, over 120 million people were expected to visit a four-month Mahakumbh. The first shahi snan (royal bath) that kicked off the festivities on March 11 saw over 3.3 million people visit Haridwar. Covid cases have been surging across several states, including some that account for a significant number of pilgrims.The high court gave its directions while hearing a bunch of PILs (public interest litigations) on Covid-related issues in the state. On March 5, the court constituted a committee with the mandate to inspect the preparations for the Mahakumbh and submit a report by March 23 with photographic evidence. The team comprised the district judge, Haridwar, the mela adhikari, the petitioner’s counsel Shiv Bhatt and the chief standing counsel. Bhatt said in the report that much of the arrangements were yet to be completed. “We suggested to the court that as some people have completed the vaccination, such pilgrims should also be allowed at the Mahakumbh if they submit a certificate,” Bhatt said.He added the court directed chief secretary Prakash, health secretary Amit Negi, inspector general of police Sanjay Gunjiyal, mela adhikari Deepak Rawat and the petitioner’s counsel (Bhatt himself) to inspect the Mahakumbh area for the following three days and try to address any shortcomings at the earliest. “The court has directed that an interim report based on the action taken after the inspection be submitted by March 30. The next date for hearing the matter has been fixed for March 31,” he said. The Mahakhumb officially starts from April 1.On February 22, the court directed the state government to submit a detailed affidavit by March 3 on its preparations in the light of the standard operating procedures released by the Centre. The court sought details of how many frontline workers had been vaccinated in Haridwar and how much medical staff was available for the Kumbh. The Centre had issued the standard operating procedures on the Mahakumbh in January after the state government approached it for the same on the order of the Uttarakhand high court.The latest court directions came in the wake of new chief minister Tirath Singh Rawat repeatedly saying that there would be no unnecessary restrictions on pilgrims. On March 13, Rawat announced that negative Covid-19 reports were not necessary to participate in the upcoming shahi snans during the mega event. Soon after, Rajesh Bhushan, Union secretary, ministry of health and family welfare, wrote to the Uttarakhand chief secretary to take stringent measures to control the spread of Covid-19 during the Kumbh Mela. Uttarakhand has so far reported 98,646 Covid-19 cases, of which 14,629 cases are from Haridwar district. Currently, Haridwar has the highest active cases among all 13 districts in the state, 351 of a total of 930. The high court noted in its order that “already alarm bells are being rung in some parts of the country, especially from the south, that the Covid-19 pandemic is again raising its head. Therefore, the pandemic continues to be a cause of concern for all of us. Some of the southern and northern states, like Rajasthan, have started imposing a partial lockdown. This is a clear indication that we are again entering the phase where the country will face the Covid-19 pandemic. Therefore, the state government is expected to be vigilant and to ensure that the Mahakumbh mela does not turn into a breeding ground for the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hc-again-makes-ve-covid-report-mandatory-for-kumbh-after-cm-rawat-scrapped-it-101616611758135.html
25-03-2021||India||From a student leader to next CJI||New Delhi From a student leader who fought for civil liberties during the nationwide Emergency in 1975 while sacrificing an academic year to taking over as the 48th chief justice of India next month, justice NV Ramana has had a remarkable journey. Born into a humble family of agriculturalists in Ponnavaram village of Andhra Pradesh’s Krishna district, justice Ramana was asked by his father in June 1975 to pack an extra change of clothes after he presided over a public meeting against the Emergency. “My father was convinced that I will be arrested,” justice Ramana recounted his experience at an event in the national capital in January when he added that he had no regrets losing a year of college when he saw so many young people sacrifice their lives for the sake of human rights. Before he joined a law college in 1980, justice Ramana worked as a journalist for a regional newspaper for two years. He was enrolled at the Bar in 1983. As a lawyer, he practised in the Andhra Pradesh high court, central administrative tribunal, the AP state administrative tribunal, and the Supreme Court in civil, criminal, constitutional, labour, service and election matters, with specialisation in constitutional, criminal, service and inter-state river laws.He was appointed a permanent judge of the Andhra Pradesh high court in 2000 and was elevated as chief justice of the Delhi high court in 2013. On February 17, 2014, he was elevated as a Supreme Court judge. Over the years, justice Ramana has been a part of several landmark judgments. He headed the bench which in January last year ruled that access to the internet is a fundamental right by extension while pulling the government up for the telecommunications blackout in Jammu & Kashmir after abrogation of Article 370. The bench then ordered the J&K administration to review all orders pertaining to the imposition of curbs on telecom and internet services and put them in the public domain.Adjudicating a bunch of petitions on the Kashmir restrictions, justice Ramana’s bench also underscored the significance of the freedom of the press. “Responsible governments are required to respect the freedom of the press at all times... journalists are to be accommodated in reporting and there is no justification for allowing a sword of Damocles to hang over the press indefinitely,” his verdict held. Justice Ramana delivered another important verdict in the Karnataka assembly case, clarifying the legal position that disqualification under the Tenth Schedule for defection could not operate as a bar for contesting re-election. Emphasising the role of the Speaker, justice Ramana wrote in the judgment: “There is a growing trend of the Speaker acting against the constitutional duty of being neutral. Further, horse-trading and corrupt practices associated with defection and change of loyalty for lure of office or wrong reasons have not abated. Thereby the citizens are denied stable governments. In these circumstances, there is need to consider strengthening certain aspects, so that such undemocratic practices are discouraged and checked.” By a judgment in January this year, justice Ramana held that fixing a notional income for a non-earning homemaker was a step towards the constitutional vision of social equality and ensuring dignity of life to all individuals. The verdict highlighted that fixing a notional income for homemakers was a step towards “recognition of the multitude of women who are engaged in this activity, whether by choice or as a result of social/cultural norms. It signals to society at large that the law and the courts of the land believe in the value of the labour, services and sacrifices of homemakers.” In a more recent ruling, a bench headed by justice Ramana held in February the restriction against grant of bail in a stringent law like The Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967 “per se does not oust the ability of Constitutional Courts to grant bail on grounds of violation” of a fundamental right like the right to a speedy trial.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/from-a-student-leader-to-next-cji-101616611757627.html
25-03-2021||India||India to focus on its vaccination drive, limit exports, say officials||India will focus on its domestic vaccination programme following a spike in Covid-19 cases and the planned expansion of the immunisation drive, and there will be no expansion of vaccine exports, people familiar with developments said on Wednesday. The people said on condition of anonymity that there will be no ban on exports, though supplies to other countries will be made only after meeting domestic needs. They also said future exports are linked to the ramping up of domestic production capacities. “We have helped countries around the world with commercial supplies and grants of vaccines and we will continue to do so,” said one of the people cited above. The people said all commercial deals and export commitments will be honoured by the country. The people said the government’s priority will be the vaccination of the country’s population. As the country’s vaccine production capacity increases and emergency use authorisations are granted for more vaccines, the government will review the situation related to exports after about two months, the people said. Several factors are behind the government’s move to slow down vaccine exports, including a need to ramp up the domestic vaccination programme following an increase in the total active caseload after it had touched its lowest mark in mid-February, and the decision to open up the immunisation drive to everyone above the age of 45 from April 1. The emergence of a double mutation in the Sars-CoV-2 virus in Maharashtra has added to the concerns related to the rise in Covid-19 cases in recent days. With 11.7 million cases, India has reported the highest number of Coronavirus infections after the US and Brazil. Vaccine manufacturers too have indicated that the current focus is on meeting domestic needs. Serum Institute of India (SII) CEO Adar Poonawalla had tweeted on February 21: “Dear countries & governments, as you await #COVISHIELD supplies, I humbly request you to please be patient, @SerumInstIndia has been directed to prioritise the huge needs of India and along with that balance the needs of the rest of the world. We are trying our best.” India has so far supplied more than 60 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines, mostly Covishield, to 76 countries. This includes 8.5 million doses provided as grants and commercial supplies of 34 million doses. However, according to data maintained on the external affairs ministry’s website, the last shipments went out almost a week ago to Namibia and Bolivia on March 18. The move will also affect supplies to the WHO-backed COVAX facility through which more than 180 countries are expected to get doses. COVAX has so far received 17.7 million doses of Covishield from India. Besides providing 200 million doses to the COVAX facility this year, India is also expected to manufacture one billion doses of Covid-19 vaccines with US and Japanese funding for the new Quad Vaccine Partnership by the end of 2022. So far, more than 51 million doses have been administered across India, of which 47 million were Covishield doses and the rest were COVAXIN. The government has asked SII to supply 141 million doses. SII, the world’s largest vaccine manufacturer, plans to boost production of the AstraZeneca vaccine to 100 million doses a month by April, up from the current level of 70 million. On Tuesday, SII sought permission from Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan to supply five million doses of Covishield to the UK this week, saying the move wouldn’t affect the domestic vaccination programme. The firm cited its licence agreement with AstraZeneca for transfer of technology for manufacturing Covishield, which states SII must treat AstraZeneca as a priority customer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-to-focus-on-its-vaccination-drive-limit-exports-say-officials-101616611697633.html
25-03-2021||India||Court summons PC and Karti in INX Media case||New Delhi A Delhi court on Wednesday summoned former Union minister and senior Congress leader P Chidambaram, his son Karti Chidambaram and eight others on April 7 taking cognizance of the Enforcement Directorate (ED) charge sheet in connection with their alleged role in the INX Media money laundering case.Special judge MK Nagpal said that there were sufficient grounds to proceed against the accused including Karti’s chartered accountant S S Bhaskararaman, Peter Mukerjea and six firms including INX Media and INX News.The charge sheet by the ED was filed under section 3 (money laundering) read with section 70 (offences by companies), which is punishable under section 4 (punishment) of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). According to the ED’s charge sheet, the first instalment of illegal gratification of ₹3,08,62,044­, in furtherance of criminal conspiracy, was allegedly paid by INX Media to M/s Advantage Strategic Consulting Pvt Ltd (ASCPL) and two other shell companies beneficially owned or controlled by Karti, namely M/s Kriya FMCG Distributors Pvt Ltd (Kriya) and M/s CBN Placement and Management Centre (CBNPMC) and this amount was paid during the year 2007-08 through the companies named SpanFibre and M/s Satyam Fibre (India) Pvt Ltd (Satyam Fibre).“Thus, in view of the background and after going through the contents of this complaint and the documents referred to therein and being relied upon in support of the allegations contained in complaint, I find sufficient material and grounds for proceeding further in the matter against all the 10 accused persons named in the complaint, out of which six accused are companies, for commission of offence under section 3 read with section 70 of the PMLA, which is punishable under section 4 of the Act,” the judge said in his order. The ED’s case arises out of a complaint registered by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) where it had contended that P Chidambaram had “misused his official position”, in conspiracy with his son Karti and others, in granting approval to a FDI proposal of INX Media and INX News Pvt Ltd in lieu of “illegal gratification” in India and through offshore payments. The CBI registered an FIR on May 15, 2017 alleging irregularities in a Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) clearance granted to the INX Media group for receiving overseas funds of ₹305 crore in 2007 during Chidambaram’s tenure as the Union finance minister. Subsequently, the ED had lodged the money-laundering case.Both Chidambaram and his son Karti are currently on bail in the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/court-summons-pc-and-karti-in-inx-media-case-101616611637604.html
25-03-2021||India||Akbar moves HC against acquittal of Ramani||New Delhi: The Delhi high court will hear on Thursday an appeal by former Union minister MJ Akbar against the dismissal of his criminal defamation case against journalist Priya Ramani.A single judge bench of justice Mukta Gupta will hear Akbar’s petition that has challenged the February 17 decision of a city court, clearing Ramani of defamation charges for her allegations of sexual harassment against him.The appeal, filed by Karanjawala & Co, has referred to portions of the trial court’s judgment which admitted in one part that the content referred to by Akbar was “defamatory in nature”, and that the “defence of the accused regarding” only part of the article referring to Akbar and the rest to “other male bosses is rejected” .Akbar has sought to highlight that once the trial court held that the content was defamatory in nature, there was a duty cast upon the trial judge to explain what exactly Ramani opted as her defence to this charge, and how her defence was accepted.It has further pointed out that the trial court dismissed Ramani’s defence that only part of the article was about Akbar and rest were about other male bosses since the article did not mark any distinction but failed to explain why she was not held culpable. Further, Akbar questioned the trial court’s verdict for accepting Ramani’s defence when she called an incorrect tweet by her about resignation by Akbar as an “honest mistake”. The appeal said the trial court did not analyse the evidence in this regard nor did it assess the impact of the wrong post on his reputation.On February 17, the trial court judgment had held that “Akbar was not a man of stellar reputation”, and reasoned that “the right to reputation cannot be protected at the cost of right to life and dignity of women as guaranteed in the Indian Constitution...”.It added that “.. perpetrators of sexual harassment ... can also be a person of reputation...”. Based on this reasoning, laid out in the verdict, judge Ravindra Kumar Pandey acquitted Ramani.The case concerns Ramani’s tweet in 2018, read in consonance with an article she wrote for Vogue magazine in 2017. In the article, she wrote about a situation where an editor interviewing her made her feel uncomfortable by conducting the interview in his hotel room.In the tweet, which came in the wake of the MeToo movement, she named Akbar as the editor. Several other women spoke about their experiences with him at the same time; one of them Ghazala Wahab even testified in favour of Ramani during the case. Akbar resigned as junior foreign minister after the allegations surfaced, and sued Ramani for defamation..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/akbar-moves-hc-against-acquittal-of-ramani-101616611577642.html

25-03-2021||India||Indian universities, 2010-2020: A decade in protest||This week, Ashoka University students boycotted classes for two days, demanding changes in the functioning of the institution following the resignation of professors Pratap Bhanu Mehta and Arvind Subramanian. While the protests were limited to a private university in this case, it is the latest in a series of student-led protests in the country, indicating a ferment in universities over the past decade.Here is a snapshot of the key moments in universities in the past decade, where students have expressed their disenchantment either due to issues specific to their university or on larger national issues, leading to a tussle with the administration, and in some cases, with the government of the day:Anti-corruption movement, 2011In August 2011, when social activist Anna Hazare launched a 15-day hunger strike in Delhi demanding a Jan Lokpal Bill to eradicate corruption, students from Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), DU, JMI, and Banaras Hindu University (BHU), among others, backed the movement. Students of DU, Jamia, and JNU also held a series of protests on campuses and parts of the national capital. A group of university students also waved black flags at then Union minister and Congress leader Kapil Sibal at New Delhi’s Constitution Club as he stood to address a meeting on Lokpal Bill. The larger protests prompted Parliament to pass a resolution accepting Hazare’s demand in August 27. Hazare called off his hunger strike the next day. More protests followed before the Lokpal Act was enacted in 2013.Also Read | Ashoka University students begin class boycott, demand changesDelhi gang-rape agitation, 2012The gang-rape of a 23-year-old physiotherapy student in Delhi on December 16, 2012, sparked nationwide protests. Students from across the country participated in the demonstrations demanding strict laws to prevent crimes against women and speedy trial and prosecution of the accused. At Delhi’s India Gate, students from DU, JNU, Jamia, and other Delhi-based institutes held protracted protests demanding justice for the woman, who died on December 29, 2012. Students in other cities including Bengaluru and Mumbai also held protests.Amid protests, the Centre formed a judicial committee and asked a former chief justice of India, J S Verma, to submit a report within 30 days suggesting amendments to criminal law to sternly deal with sexual assault cases. On February 3, 2013, the Criminal Law (Amendment) Ordinance was promulgated. The ordinance provided for a death penalty in cases of rape. On March 20, 2020, four adult convicts in the case were executed.Delhi University protests, 2013-14 DU’s 2013 move to introduce a four-year programme to promote interdisciplinary learning and research at the undergraduate level triggered protests. Students and teachers said the programme was introduced without proper planning, consultations, resources, and course content. In June 2014, during the admission process, students held protests seeking a roll-back of the programme and prompted the newly-elected Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government to scrap it.Jadavpur University protest, 2014-15 The hok kalorob (let there be uproar) movement at Kolkata’s Jadavpur University was one of the longest student protests in the country between September 2014 and January 2015. The protest was held against an alleged police attack on students while they were demanding an inquiry into the molestation of a student on the campus. The alleged attack also triggered a series of student protests in Mumbai, Delhi, Bengaluru and Hyderabad.The students demanded resignation of vice-chancellor Abhijit Chakrabarti for allegedly calling the police to the campus. Final year students also boycotted the convocation ceremony and a student declined to accept her degree in the presence Chakrabarti. At least 10 students started an “indefinite hunger strike” on January 5, 2015, before Chakrabarti resigned.Film and Television Institute of India (FTII) protests, 2015 In July 2015, FTII students launched an agitation questioning actor Gajendra Chauhan’s credentials for his nomination as the institute’s chairman. They alleged he was named as the FTII head because of his political affiliation. The protest lasted for 139 days as students boycotted classes and refused to take exams. Protests were held in other places as well in solidarity with FTII students. On August 15, 2015, police carried out a midnight raid on the campus and arrested five protesting students for allegedly confining the institute director to his cabin. Chauhan was replaced by actor Anupam Kher in October 2017 before his three-year term ended.Protest over Rohith Vemula’s death, 2016Dalit scholar Vemula’s death by suicide at Hyderabad University triggered nationwide protests over alleged discrimination on the campus. Vemula was found dead days he was among the five students, who were expelled from the university’s hostel and provided limited access to the campus for allegedly assaulting a student leader. Vemula also left behind a note blaming the “system” for his death.JNU sedition row, 2016In 2016, police complaints were filed alleging “anti-national” slogans were raised during a protest over Afzal Guru, who was hanged for his role in the Parliament attack. Three students, JNU Students’ Union president Kanhaiya Kumar, Umar Khalid and Anirbhan Bhattacharya, were arrested under sedition charges. The arrest sparked protests across the country. Students at universities including DU, Aligarh Muslim University (AMU), Jadavpur, Punjab University, University of Kerala also held protests in support of JNU students.The JNU authorities conducted an inquiry and took action against 21 students. The action ranged from rustication to fines. In response, students went on an indefinite strike. The Delhi high court suspended the university action on the condition that students end their strike in May 2016. After almost three years, the Delhi police in January 2019 filed a charge sheet against Kumar and nine others. In January this year, the Delhi government gave its nod to prosecute Kumar and others.Banaras Hindu University protests, 2017In September 2017, thousands of students, mostly women, protested when a BHU student was allegedly molested by three men on campus. The students alleged that instead of raising the matter with authorities, the hostel warden questioned the students for staying out till late. The students launched a protest outside the campus alleging lack of safety on the campus and “victim shaming” by the officials.Three days after the protest was launched, Uttar Pradesh Police launched a crackdown and lathi-charged the students to end the protest. A video of woman students being beating up by policemen triggered outrage. The police detained several students and filed cases against over 1,000 protesting students.Aligarh Muslim University’s Jinnah portrait controversy, 2018An armed group of Hindu Yuva Vahini entered the AMU campus and clashed with the students in May 2018 after former BJP lawmaker Satish Gautam objected to a portrait of Pakistan’s founder Mohammad Ali Jinnah on the campus. AMU Students’ Union leader Maskoor Usmani was among those injured in the incident. AMU authorities insisted the portrait had been at its students’ union office since 1938 since Jinnah was a founding member of the University court-- the highest decision-making body. There are portraits of Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru, and the Dalai Lama, among others, in the same office. Many questioned why similar objections were not raised over Jinnah’s plaque at the Bombay high court museum.The AMU students boycotted classes and began a sit-in on the campus seeking action and an inquiry into the attack on them. The protest continued for weeks and the university was forced to postpone exams.Anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act protest, 2019-2020A group of JMI students, locals, and teachers began a march towards the Parliament in protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and triggered protests across the country. Clashes broke out between the protesters and the police when they were stopped. As many as 50 students were detained as police used tear gas and lathis to disperse the protesters.Another protest march was stopped on December 15, 2019 and several students were allegedly attacked by the police. The same evening, police stormed into Jamia’s central library and attacked students leaving many severely injured. The videos of policemen beating students, who were studying in the library triggered a nationwide uproar and international condemnation. Thousands of students gathered outside the police headquarters to protesting against the attack and demanding the release of the detained students. Students gathered at the university to protest against the CAA and police brutality. Locals also joined them for the next three months until the protest was called off due to the Covid-19 pandemic in March 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indian-universities-2010-2020-a-decade-in-protest-101616585103634.html

A host of festivals starting with Holi is scheduled to be celebrated in the coming months. States have not imposed restrictions on inter-state movement but many have stepped up testing and surveillance in places of transit.

25-03-2021||India||For the BJP, the battle in states — with an eye on Rajya Sabha||For the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the upcoming state assembly elections are not just an opportunity to consolidate and expand its footprint across southern and eastern India, but also ramp up its strength in the Rajya Sabha, where it is still in minority.As many as 22 Rajya Sabha seats in these states—all held by non-BJP parties—will be up for grabs between the state election results and May 2024, when the term of the current Lok Sabha will be over. West Bengal, where the BJP is pitted against Mamata Banerjee’s Trinamool Congress, accounts for half of these seats. The BJP has a strong presence in Bengal and won as many as 18 Lok Sabha seats in the 2019 election. But it has never had a Rajya Sabha member from the state.Whether it wins or not, if it gets at least 43 seats in the assembly, which is highly likely, the BJP can elect its first Rajya Sabha MP from West Bengal in August 2023—when six seats from Bengal will face biennial elections. And any gain in Bengal for the BJP might lead to losses for Mamata Banerjee’s Trinamool Congress that holds five of those six seats.Also Read | HT Interview: ‘BJP provided road map for Sonar Bangla,’ says Amit ShahOf the current 237 seats of the Upper House of Parliament, the BJP has 95 seats while its broader National Democratic Alliance has 110 seats—just nine seats short of the majority mark. With the support of friendly parties such as the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) (nine MPs), Biju Janata Dal (nine MPs) and Yuvajana Sramika Rythu Congress Party (six MPs), clearing bills in the Upper House has become smoother for the government in this term than it was in its first term, but the absence of a direct majority means more political work and negotiations with smaller forces.In the past two years, after it retained power in the 2019 elections, the BJP has rapidly improved its position in the Upper House. It had just 73 seats before the 2019 national elections. The Congress has less than 50 seats for the first time in the Upper House.Two Rajya Sabha seats from Assam, currently held by the Congress, will go to polls early next year. The BJP might get an opportunity to grab at least one of them, if not both, if it does well in the assembly polls.Three Rajya Sabha seats from Kerala and six from Tamil Nadu will go to the polls between now and May 2024. While the BJP’s prospects in Kerala are rather limited, in Tamil Nadu, it has a partnership with the AIADMK. But in both the southern states, the BJP’s chances of getting a Rajya Sabha seat are minimal. It is the Congress which can hope to gain here, but this will be contingent on its performance in Kerala and its negotiations with the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam in Tamil Nadu, provided the opposition alliance wins.India’s bicameral Parliament—inspired from the British system—has the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha. The Upper House enjoys nearly all the power of Lok Sabha except that it can’t veto a budget or any money bill.As India’s federal laws need the approval of both Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha, the Upper House—although not directly elected by the public—can reject a bill or seek amendments. Also, a legislation introduced in Rajya Sabha has no shelf life and will remain alive till it has been passed by the House.While Lok Sabha members are elected directly by the voters, the Rajya Sabha members come through a complex process of proportional representation and by votes of the MLAs of their respective states. The calculation is: (total number of MLAs of the state ÷ no of seats going to poll in the state +1) +1.Each MLA ranks candidates according to his or her preference. If a candidate gets the minimum requisite votes, he or she would be elected. But if in a contest, a candidate fails to get the requisite votes from the first preference of the voters, the second preference votes would be counted.The strength of Rajya Sabha is 245, out of which 233 are elected from the states and union territories. The remaining 12 members are nominated by the President. The number of Rajya Sabha MPs will depend of the size of the population of that state. Uttar Pradesh, the most populous state of India, sends 31 MPs to the Upper House, while Arunachal Pradesh has just one seat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/for-the-bjp-the-battle-in-states-with-an-eye-on-rajya-sabha-101616565482268.html
25-03-2021||India||1,000-year old Yadadri temple in Telangana gets complete makeover||Telangana chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao’s dream to build a magnificent temple in the state that matches Tirumala, India’s richest temple in the neighbouring Andhra Pradesh, is going to be a reality soon. The ancient cave shrine of Lord Lakshmi Narasimha Swamy on the picturesque hills of Yadagirigutta, about 70-km away from Hyderabad, is getting ready for inauguration with a complete makeover at cost of nearly ₹1,000 crore. Hundreds of sculptors and artisans are working round the clock to give final touches to this magnificent 1,000-year-old Vaishnavaite temple, which civil engineers and civic officials are racing against the time to complete the necessary civic infrastructure to provide all amenities for the pilgrims. A sprawling 14.5-acre temple complex consists of seven temple domes, including a 100-foot main dome. “All the works related to the main temple complex including architectural works like inner and outer prakarams (compound walls), various types of stone-carved pillars, affiliated temples, sculptures of various gods and goddesses and Alwars (Vaishnavaite preachers) have been completed,” G Kishan Rao, vice-chairman and chief executive officer of Yadadri Temple Development Authority (YTDA), said. Similarly, works on pushkarni (tank where devotees take a holy dip before having darshan), Kalyana Katta (tonsuring hall), circular road and queue lines, prasadam complex will be completed by March end and the temple will be ready for inauguration by the first week of May.The total cost of the Yadadri project is around ₹1,800 crore. “Till now, we have spent ₹837 crore for the project which includes construction of retaining walls, development of temple city in 250 acres, land acquisition cost and development of infrastructure like laying of roads, construction of VVIP cottages and augmentation of drinking water supply,” Rao said. Works on various other developmental works in the pilgrim town including provision of tourist facilities comprising cottages, multilevel parking and housing for the temple priests in a total area of 1,400 acres are going on, he said. The centuries-old temple on Yadagirigutta, renamed now as Yadadri, was originally confined to just 2,500 square yards of area. Now, the temple complex is spread over 14.5 acres. The main hillock where the cave temple is located and eight other hills and lush green forests adjacent to it are being developed into a beautiful temple town. The works which began in April 2016 are nearing completion. The temple is being redeveloped according to the ancient Agama shastra (scriptures dealing with construction of temples) and other Vedic scriptures. “The uniqueness of the temple is that it is reconstructed without using cement, concrete or bricks, but only with Krishnashila (black granite) used by Kakatiya emperors of Telangana for the temple architecture. It can remain intact for another 10-11 centuries,” the YTDA CEO said. Like Lord Venkateshwara of Tirumala, who devotees believe would fulfil all their desires, people of Telangana believe Lord Narasimha of Yadadri is most powerful, who wards off evil spirits and cures psychological disorders. They even believe that they could get cured of physical ailments. “That is why the chief minister felt the need to develop Yadadri into a globally-known shrine on the lines of Tirumala,” Rao added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/1000year-old-yadadri-temple-in-telangana-gets-complete-makeover-101616554081666.html
