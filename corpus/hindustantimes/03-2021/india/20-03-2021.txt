The statement added that the students would protest till these demands were met, and added that if they were not “met by Tuesday” (March 23), the students would “organise a separate movement demanding that the Vice-Chancellor resign”.The university and the founders have so far not offered their version of events.During a townhall with students on Thursday, VC Sarkar rejected allegations that Mehta was asked to resign due to his role as a government critic. “I spoke to Pratap and tried to persuade him multiple times not to leave Ashoka and to withdraw his resignation,” she said.News of Mehta’s exit broke on Thursday — he resigned on March 15 — and caused a stir among students and faculty of the university, and the academic community across India and overseas. “After a meeting with Founders it has become abundantly clear to me that my association with the University may be considered a political liability. My public writing in support of a politic that tries to honour constitutional values of freedom and equal respect for all citizens is perceived to carry risks for the university. In the interests of the University, I resign,” he said in his resignation letter.Faculty members also wrote to V-C Malabika Sarkar saying that Mehta’s exit would set a “chilling precedent”. Sheldon Pollock, a Sanskrit scholar who is closely associated with Ashoka University, also issued a statement on Thursday expressing his solidarity with Mehta.On Friday morning, his colleague and former chief economic adviser Subramanian resigned saying he was “devastated” by Mehta’s resignation, and it reflected the university’s inability to protect “academic freedom and expression”.Late on Friday, around 150 academics from overseas universities wrote an open letter terming Mehta’s exit as a “dangerous attack on academic freedom”.In the letter, addressed to Ashoka trustees, administration, and the faculty, the academics express their “distress” over Mehta’s resignation under “political pressure”. “A prominent critic of the current Indian government and defender of academic freedom, he had become a target for his writings. It seems that Ashoka’s Trustees, who should have treated defending him as their institutional duty, instead all but forced his resignation,” it read.The signatories included Homi K Bhabha, Anne F Rothenberg, professor of humanities at Harvard University; Erwin Chemerinsky, dean at the University of California Berkeley School of Law; Rogers Smith, Partha Chatterjee of Columbia University; Faisal Devji, professor of Indian history, University of Oxford; and Lawrence Lessig of Harvard Law School.The university alumni council on Friday held a meeting to discuss the future course of action in order to “protect the academic freedom in the university”.On Saturday, Rajan weighed in on LinkedIn. He wrote that “free speech” is the soul of a great university and by “compromising on it, the founders (of Ashoka) have bartered away its soul”. “The reality is that professor Mehta is a thorn in the side of the establishment. He is no ordinary thorn because he skewers those in government and in high offices like the Supreme Court with vivid prose and thought-provoking arguments,” he added.HT learns that on Friday, some of the founders met Mehta and sought his return. Ashoka University did not respond to queries, saying a statement on the matter will be issued soon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/varsity-students-plan-two-day-class-boycott-101616263988388.html
20-03-2021||India||Fire breaks out in tent at Singhu border: Farmers' union||A fire broke out in a tent at Delhi's Singhu border where farmers have been protesting the Centre's three agri laws, the Samyukta Kisan Morcha claimed on Saturday.Sukhwinder Singh, a protester, said the incident took place around 10 am near an under-construction flyover where the tent was put up.However, there was no official word about the incident from the police or the fire department.The tent was completely burnt, said the Morcha, which is heading the agitation.A man was also injured while trying to extinguish the blaze. The incident took place after a cylinder caught fire, the SKM claimed.There were around 10 to 12 people inside the tent when the blaze broke out. Five mobile phones, 20 mattresses, 20 chairs and dry ration was destroyed, it said, adding that a fire tender from Kundali doused the fire.Dilpreet Singh, a resident of Punjab's Patiala district who is taking part in the agitation, said a man named Rajwant Singh was injured in the incident."The fire broke out when we were making tea. Rajwant was injured while dousing the fire. There were 12 to 13 people in the tent. We will make our new tent tomorrow," Dilpreet said.Hundreds of farmers are camping at Delh's borders points at Ghazipur, Singhu and Tikri since November demanding that the Centre repeal the three contentious farm laws and make a new one that would ensure legal guarantee on the MSP.Enacted in September, the three farm laws have been projected by the Centre as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove middlemen and allow farmers to sell their produce anywhere in the country.The protesting farmers, on the other hand, have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of the Minimum Support Price (MSP) and do away with the "mandi" (wholesale market) system, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fire-breaks-out-in-tent-at-singhu-border-farmers-union-101616260903373.html
20-03-2021||India||Harsh Vardhan says laxity shown by people behind spike in daily case||Holding the laxity shown by people as the reason behind the recent surge in coronavirus cases, Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan on Saturday urged them not to let their guard down against the infection unless the situation may turn “dangerous”.“With vaccines available now, people feel they should not wear masks. Maximum people hang their masks around their neck, some keep it in their pocket and some do not use it at all,” the minister said here on Saturday evening.Covid-19 cases have again started rising at some places in the country for the past some time and the laxity shown by people towards the infection is the basic reason behind it, Vardhan said, adding that the situation may turn “dangerous”.“If we do not follow Covid appropriate behavior, then coronavirus will go away slowly from the country and the world,” he said.“I want to appeal to people of the country that they should not let the Covid appropriate behavior get weakened at any cost. Maintaining social distancing, wearing masks properly and washing hands with soap probably are the biggest tools to win the fight against Covid-19,” said Vardhan.Vardhan also said there was no need for vaccination for all while asserting that the two vaccines developed in the country are completely safe and effective.The vaccination drive should also be turned into a mass movement, he said, adding that the vaccines are available at 50,000 government and private health facilities in the country.He said the priority groups have been set after keeping in the mind the scientific criteria and studying the behavior of Covid-19.“You know that the behavior of Covid virus is dynamic and the vaccination process is also dynamic. Under this dynamic process, the criteria will be expanded as and when time requires,” he said.Asserting that saving lives is a priority for the government, the minister said ₹35,000 crores had been earmarked in the Union Budget for the Covid-19 vaccination.He expressed concern over the rise in cases in Chandigarh, Mohali and Panchkula.Vardhan also inaugurated a national resource centre for oral health care of children and elderly, an advanced PET-CT facility, 384 slice dual source CT scan and a refractive surgery suite at the Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/harsh-vardhan-says-laxity-shown-by-people-behind-spike-in-daily-case-101616259562451.html
20-03-2021||India||Digital platforms promote transparency, corruption-free atmosphere: Prakash Javadekar||Union minister for information and broadcasting Prakash Javadekar on Saturday pitched digital platforms as a medium to promote transparency and introduce corruption-free atmosphere in governance. He reiterated that the new guidelines by the government for over the top (OTT) and social media platforms are an attempt to provide a level playing field for various digital platforms."Through these guidelines on OTT, we have tried to bring about transparency and provide level playing field to various media platforms, be it electronic, print or digital media. It is just for fair-facilitation for self-regulation and not intended for controlling the OTT platforms,” the Union minister said while addressing a digital media conclave in Mumbai.Javadekar’s remark comes in the backdrop of new rules notified by the government last month that will govern online content. This includes allowing users to dispute action against them by social media intermediaries like Facebook and Twitter, and setting up a three-tier self-regulatory framework for OTT platforms such as Amazon Prime, Netflix and Hotstar, and online news media entities.The Supreme Court, however, had earlier this month stated that the rules “do not have teeth” and asked the Centre to consider legislation that could also provide for “prosecution”.Pointing to the role played by digital media in facilitating the government’s functioning during the Covid-19 pandemic, Javadekar said that more than 50 cabinet meetings were held virtually ensuring that there weren't any delays in decision making, according to an I&B ministry statement.The minister also spoke about the role played by digital platforms in economic transactions. He said that more than 13 lakh crore rupees were transferred to 35 crore people through DBT (Direct Benefit Transfer) mode under various welfare schemes of the central government. "More than 12.30 crore farmers received money in their accounts directly, without any leakage of funds," he said at the event, according to the I&B ministry statement."It (digital mode of payment) has now become our way of life, as even a vegetable vendor keeps a QR code to facilitate digital payment," the minister said, citing the example of DIKSHA Platform (Digital Infrastructure for Knowledge Sharing) to highlight the importance of digital education.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/digital-platforms-promote-transparency-corruption-free-atmosphere-prakash-javadekar-101616260183844.html

20-03-2021||India||Raised human rights issues, says US defence secretary. A strong rebuttal follows||US defence secretary Lloyd Austin, the first senior member of the Biden administration to visit India, said on Saturday he had raised issues of human rights of the country’s minorities with members of the Indian cabinet as “partners need to be able to have those kinds of discussions”.Austin, the first African-American to hold the post of US defence secretary, made the remarks while responding to a question during a media briefing on whether he had raised the issue of human rights of India’s minorities during his interactions with Indian interlocutors.Indian officials, however, said there was no specific discussion with Austin on human rights in India at his meetings with defence minister Rajnath Singh or external affairs minister S Jaishankar. Human rights and values were discussed as shared strengths of the two countries, senior Indian officials said.Austin said human rights and values are important to both sides, and the US will lead with these values. Jaishankar agreed and emphasised that a strong India-US relationship was important for both countries and the rest of the world, people aware of the conversation between the ministers said.The only specific discussion on these issues pertained to minorities and women in Afghanistan, the officials said.Austin acknowledged he had discussed with defence minister Rajnath Singh the issue of India’s acquisition of the S-400 missile defence system from Russia, which faces potential sanctions under the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA). Austin, however, said the sanctions were not “on the table” as India is yet to acquire the weapon system.He also said the US never considered that “India and China were on the threshold of war” during their ongoing standoff in the Ladakh sector of the Line of Actual Control (LAC).Asked specifically if he had raised the violation of human rights of India’s minorities as the first member of the Biden administration to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Austin replied that he “did not have an opportunity to talk with him [Modi]” about the issue during their meeting on Friday.“Having said that, I did have a conversation with other members of the cabinet on this issue. I think we have to remember that India is our partner and a partner whose partnership we value, and I think partners need to be able to have those kinds of discussions. And certainly, we feel comfortable in doing that, and you can have those discussions in a very meaningful way and still make progress,” Austin said.Prior to his arrival in India, US Senate Foreign Relations Committee chair Bob Menendez wrote a letter to Austin, asking him to raise concerns about India “trending away” from shared democratic values, including the Indian government’s handling of the farmers’ protest and a crackdown on journalists and critics, and the S-400 deal with Russia.Responding to a question on Menendez’s letter, Austin said, “You’ve heard President [Joe] Biden say that... human rights and the rule of law [are] important to the United States of America. We always lead with our values and as a democracy, that’s pretty important to us. And again, India is a democratic country and you treasure your values as well. So, there are a number of things that we can and will work on together.”Austin evaded a direct reply to a question on whether the S-400 deal would pose a problem for the India-US relationship and only said sanctions were not on the table as the weapon system had not been delivered to India.India has defended its $5.4-billion deal with Russia for five S-400 systems, the first of which is expected to be delivered by September. The US has already imposed sanctions on its NATO ally Turkey for a similar deal.Austin said, “We have countries that we work with from time to time that have Soviet or... Russian equipment that they’ve acquired over the years and we certainly urge all our allies and our partners to move away from Soviet or Russian equipment... and really avoid any kind of acquisition that would trigger sanctions on our behalf.”“There’s been no delivery of an S-400 system and so that conversation, that issue of sanctions is not one that’s been discussed but we did address with the minister of defence the issue of the S-400,” he added.Austin dismissed a question on whether a war between India and China was imminent, and said India and the US could work with like-minded countries to check Chinese aggression in the region.“On the first part of the question, the answer is no. To my knowledge, we’ve never considered that India and China were on the threshold of war,” he said.The US, he said, is working with like-minded countries such as India, Australia, and Japan to maintain freedom of navigation, promote peace and stability, and “ensure a free and open Indo-Pacific region”. Working with these countries with shared interests is “the way you check any aggression in any region,” he added.Austin was equally dismissive of a question on reports about US troops staying on in Afghanistan till November, several months after the deadline for their withdrawal in May under a deal with the Taliban. He said, “You know I am a pretty prominent guy in those discussions typically, and to my knowledge the president has not made a decision or made any announcements on when he will decide to remove the troops.”“As you know, there is a rigorous process that’s ongoing as the president really works his way through making that decision and no decisions have been made, no decisions on length of stay or troop numbers have been made to this point,” Austin stated.He said his discussions with defence minister Rajnath Singh covered a wide range of topics, including equipment, information-sharing, and additional opportunities for logistics support. “We consider India to be a great partner and... there’s just a lot of opportunity there to strengthen that partnership and to do some additional things to make sure that we’re promoting peace and stability in the region and providing for a free and open Indo-Pacific region,” he said.People familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that Austin’s hour-long meeting with external affairs minister S Jaishankar focused on the strategic situation in the Indo-Pacific. Jaishankar spoke on India’s current security challenges and the discussions also covered the changing scenario in Europe and West Asia.The situation in Afghanistan was addressed in detail and Austin and Jaishankar exchanged their assessments of the ground situation and the peace process, the people said. They also discussed the concerns and interests of regional powers.While highlighting the commonalities and convergences in India-US ties, Jaishankar said the relationship was unique for the breadth and intensity of cooperation in numerous domains, the people said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/raised-human-rights-issues-with-indian-ministers-us-defense-secretary-101616256996248.html

20-03-2021||India||Farmers seek withdrawal of par panel's recommendation to implement 1 agri law||The Samyukta Kisan Morcha on Saturday sought the withdrawal of a parliamentary panel's recommendation asking the Centre to implement the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020, one of the three agri laws against which the farmers have been protesting at Delhi borders for over 100 days.The SKM, an umbrella body of over 40 farmers' union leading the farmers' agitation, alleged that the ECAA allows "unlimited private hoarding and black marketing".Their remarks comes after a parliamentary panel asked the government to implement in "letter and spirit" the ECAA. This panel also has members from opposition parties including Congress, TMC and AAP. These parties have been demanding repeal of all three farm laws enacted by the Centre recently."It must not escape attention that the ECAA makes a wholly anti-poor recommendation that food, which is the most essential item for the survival of human beings, should be removed from the list of EC."It allows unlimited private hoarding and black marketing. It will lead to the winding up of the PDS facilities and structures," the SKM said in a statement.It added that the implementation of the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act will "expose 75 crore beneficiaries to open market purchase of food requirements, promoting Corporate and MNCs in food markets".In its report tabled in the Lok Sabha on March 19, the Standing Committee on Food chaired by TMC leader Sudip Bandyopadhyay recommended the government to "implement the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020 in letter and spirit, and without let or hindrances so that the farmers and other stakeholders of farming sector in this country receive the benefits intended under the said Act".The SKM said, "It is entirely disgraceful that many parties which have been claiming support to farmers agitation for repeal of three farm laws have voted for the implementation of the ECAA."This exposes a wider consensus amongst these parties on these laws. We appeal to the committee to withdraw these recommendations," it said.The farmers' body has called "Bharat Bandh" on March 26.The Morcha, which held a meeting on Saturday, also decided that on 22 March, meetings of public organizations will be held at the district level across the country.It was decided that during the 'Bharat Bandh' on March 26, all services except emergency services will be inactive from 6 am to 6 pm, and road and rail transport will be blocked, the SKM said.It said on March 28, copies of three agricultural laws will be burnt in 'Holika Dahan' and on April 5, farmers will 'gherao' offices of Food Corporation of India across the country from 11 am to 5 pm.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-seek-withdrawal-of-par-panel-s-recommendation-to-implement-1-agri-law-101616254714127.html
20-03-2021||India||NIA takes over Mansukh Hiran death case||The Centre on Saturday suo motu handed over the probe into Thane businessman Mansukh Hiran’s death to the National Investigation Agency (NIA). The central agency has been probing the explosives-laden SUV which was found outside industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s residence last month. The NIA will take over the case from the Maharashtra Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS), which has been investigating the possible murder of Hiran, a 48-year-old Thane-based auto spare parts dealer, who is linked to the Scorpio that was found with 20 loose gelatin sticks, and a threatening letter addressed to the Ambanis, outside their Antilia residence in Mumbai on February 25. NIA officials will take over case files, including the post mortem report of Hiran, after re-registering the First Information Report (FIR) filed by the ATS on March 7 against unknown persons for the charge of murder. The NIA arrested suspended police officer Sachin Vaze on March 13 for purportedly planting the explosives in the SUV. The ATS has also questioned Vaze over his role in Hiran’s death after it came to light, through Hiran’s wife’s statement, that the two knew each other. The ATS on Saturday sought Vaze’s custody in the murder investigation but the NIA special court scheduled the hearing to March 25 when his custody with the NIA ends. Also read: ‘Bring CIA and KGB too’ - Sena on transfer of Mansukh Hiran death probe to NIAThe ministry of home affairs (MHA) used its power under Section 8 of the NIA Act, which says that any connected offence related to a scheduled offence already under investigation, in which the suspect is the same, can also be taken over by the central anti-terror agency. The ATS approached the special NIA court on Saturday seeking Vaze’s custody, but the court scheduled the hearing to March 25, when Vaze’s NIA custody ends. After Hiran’s body washed up ashore at a creek in Thane district on March 5, Hiran’s wife, Vimla (43), gave a statement to the ATS which led them to file a murder case against unknown persons. Vimla told the ATS that she suspected that Vaze, who knew Hiran well, was involved in his death. Vaze was also the lead investigator in the explosives case before it was briefly handed over to the ATS. The NIA took charge of the case on March 9. “The NIA has the information that Vaze had even called Hiran for questioning when he was the Investigating Officer (IO) of the SUV case. We are trying to establish the chain of events after that,” an NIA official said on condition of anonymity. Vaze had borrowed the SUV, that was found parked outside Antilia, in November 2020 and returned it to Hiran on February 5. Hiran had later reported the car as stolen on February 18, a day after he had met Vaze outside the police headquarters near Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (CSMT). Vaze, who was attached to the Crime Intelligence Unit of the Mumbai Crime Branch, was suspended after Vimla’s allegations became the centre of a political storm between the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) seeking his arrest while the House was in session. On March 13, a Thane district and sessions court denied Vaze’s anticipatory bail plea and said that his custodial interrogation in Hiran’s murder investigation was “necessary”. The NIA has identified Vaze’s co-conspirators in a bomb conspiracy case and some arrests are likely to happen after all the evidence is gathered, officials said. The NIA team on Friday reconstructed the crime scene at Carmichael Road where the Ambanis live and the Scorpio was found parked. The probe agency is also examining several suspects and witnesses that include Mumbai police officers and some private persons, said an officer, who did not want to be named. HT had reported that NIA’s investigations revealed that Vaze had planned the explosive conspiracy with some other players. Political reactions BJP leader Kirit Somaiya on Saturday said in a press conference that the party is happy that the NIA is looking at both the cases now and that the chief minister cannot save Vaze any longer. The BJP, including leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis, has been alleging that Shiv Sena – a party that Vaze had joined when he had retired from the force in 2007 till he was reinstated in 2020 – had been protecting Vaze’s involvement in the case. The claim has been repeatedly refuted by the party, including CM Uddhav Thackeray who had said that the investigation will be conducted in a free and fair manner, and anyone found guilty would be punished. However, editorials in the Sena mouthpiece Saamana had criticized the NIA for taking over the explosives investigation. He said, “I recently spoke with the family of Mansukh Hiran and they are satisfied with the investigation. Antilia and Mansukh Hiran murder is one case that will now be investigated by a single agency. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray tried to save Vaze by separating both the investigation,” Somaiya said. Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut on Saturday said that the NIA taking over the probe into Hiran’s death was not a setback to the Mumbai police or the Maharashtra government. “There was no need for the NIA to take up the probe into the explosives-laden SUV and Mansukh Hiran case. The Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) and Mumbai police were capable of investigating them,” Raut said in Nashik.“However, the Centre is looking for opportunities to see how the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government can be put in a spot. You can bring the CIA or the KGB... It makes no difference. It is not a setback to the Mumbai police or the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government,” he said. Investigations continue Earlier this week, the NIA had recovered the original number plate of the Scorpio from a Mercedes Benz purportedly being used by Vaze, 6-7 other number plates; a set of clothes which Vaze had apparently changed after the SUV was dropped at Carmichael Road around 2.20 am on February 25; ₹5.75 lakh cash and a currency counting machine apart from kerosene oil suspected to have been used to burn the oversized kurta worn by the suspect. Forensic officials on Friday said that the NIA team made Vaze walk on paths marked with start and end points, while two forensic teams took pictures and made a video for a gait analysis. The images will be fed in a computerised system along with parameters like height, weight and width of the person which will be compared to the video from a CCTV grab that emerged last week that showed a man in what seemed to be a PPE kit or a long kurta, with his face covered, walking on Carmichael Road when the SUV was parked. An NIA team visited Vaze’s house on Saturday afternoon for over two hours. Also, the deputy commissioner of police, ATS, Rajkumar Shinde visited the Thane ATS office in Wagle estate for an investigation. A team comprising three NIA officials accompanied by local police also visited Vaze’s Saket Complex residence in Thane. “The team reached the house at 12:30 pm on Saturday and was there till almost 2:30 pm. This was their second visit to Vaze’s house, the team had earlier visited for over six hours on Wednesday,” a police officer said.

20-03-2021||India||Param Bir Singh alleges Deshmukh asked Vaze to extort ₹100 cr; minister denies||Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh on Saturday rubbished the allegations of extortion made by Param Bir Singh, who was recently removed as the Mumbai police commissioner over alleged mishandling of a bomb scare case near industrialist Mukesh Ambani's residence. Deshmukh said that the former Mumbai top cop is trying to save himself."When it is getting clear that he was involved in Mukesh Ambani bomb scare case as well as in the case of Mansukh Hiran's death and there are possibilities of him getting exposed, the former police commissioner Param Bir Singh made false allegations against me to save himself from further legal action," according to a rough translation of Deshmukh's tweet posted in Marathi.The Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader said in other tweets that investigations are underway in these cases.Also Watch: NIA recreates crime scene, arrested Mumbai cop made to walk near AntiliaDeshmukh's party is one of the constituents of the ruling Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) alliance. The Shiv Sena and Congress are the other two.His reaction comes after some reports claimed that Singh wrote to Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, alleging that Deshmukh asked Sachin Vaze - a suspended policeman who has been arrested in connection with the case - to collect ₹100 crore from various establishments in Mumbai. The bomb scare case is being handled by the National Investigation Agency (NIA).The reports also said that Singh marked a copy of the letter to Maharashtra governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari and Union home ministry.Deshmukh's reaction is in stark contrast with Sena's stand, which defended Singh saying his transfer did not make him a criminal, and alleged a "particular lobby in Delhi" was upset with him as the TRP scam came to light during his tenure.Also Read: Spotlight on Deshmukh as Vaze case strains tiesOn Wednesday, Singh was replaced by Hemant Nagrale. On Thursday, Deshmukh, who belongs to the NCP, told reporters that a few officers from Mumbai Police has committed “serious and unpardonable mistakes” that had come to light in the preliminary inquiry in the bomb scare case, and that Singh’s transfer was not “routine”.Sena leader Sanjay Raut earlier defended Vaze, arrested by the NIA on March 13, for his role in the explosives-laden SUV parked outside Antilia, Ambani’s residence, on February 25.The strain in the MVA was highlighted by the Congress leader Sanjay Nirupam, who said such contradictory statements would further damage the image of the government.The NIA, meanwhile, also took over the probe into the death of Thane-based businessman Mansukh Hiran. His body was found in a Thane creek on March 5, days after the explosives-laden SUV was found parked outside Antilia.The SUV was in possession of Hiran. Earlier, the Maharashtra ATS was investigating the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-home-minister-anil-deshmukh-rubbishes-param-bir-singh-s-extortion-claims-101616248976454.html

20-03-2021||India||Centre delists works on Vizag coffee plantations from NREGP, tribal farmers in lurch||A recent decision of the Central government to delist works related to coffee plantations from permissible activities under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Programme (MGNREGP) has left more than one lakh tribal farmers in forest areas of Paderu and Araku in Andhra Pradesh’s Visakhapatnam district in a lurch.The Union ministry of rural development conveyed the same to the Andhra Pradesh government in September, stating that the MGNREGP would no more applicable to works taken up in the coffee plantations in the tribal areas of Visakhapatnam, where the famed “Araku coffee” is produced.“The decision was taken following a recommendation made by the Coffee Board of India in April 2020. They contend that coffee plantation is not a perennial crop like other horticulture crops like mango. Secondly, coffee is also a commercial crop. Hence, it cannot come under the MGNREGP,” Andhra Pradesh commissioner of panchayat raj and rural development M Girija Shankar said.He said the state government had already written twice to the Union ministry to reconsider its decision. “Our chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy, too, wrote a similar letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and our MPs, too, represented the matter with the Centre, but we fail to understand why the Centre is refusing to concede our request,” Girija Shankar said.The Andhra Pradesh government has been promoting the raising of coffee plantation under MGNREGP since 2009-10, as an area-specific work in the Scheduled V areas (tribal pockets) of the Eastern Ghats in Visakhapatnam district.“Only wage component tasks, such as pitting, planting and intercultural operations, are taken up under the MGNREGP and the material component is being met by the Integrated Tribal Development Agency (ITDA) and the Coffee Board. Funds are directly paid to the beneficiary bank accounts,” the commissioner said, adding that the total wage component under the project was around ₹32,000 per acre.According to Dr Salijamala Venkateswar, project officer of ITDA, Paderu, the Centre had permitted coffee plantation works in Visakhapatnam as a special project. Normally, MGNREGP doesn’t cover agriculture labour but covers manual labour under horticulture, sericulture, plantation and farm forestry.“It was basically aimed at preventing the tribal people from undertaking shifting cultivation that destroys forest areas and providing them with a sustained livelihood. Since they have very small landholding – from half-acre to a maximum of two acres, payment of wages under the MGNREGP would go a long way to improve their living standards,” Venkateshwar said.He said under this programme, each tribal farmer was getting an average of ₹245 per day, there were 81 person-days during a year. “On average, each tribal used to get ₹20-25,000 per year towards wages under the project. Now, they are deprived of the same,” he said.According to the ITDA official, the Coffee Board decided to delist the Araku coffee plantation works from the MGNREGP as it was under pressure from other coffee-growing states like Kerala, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu to include their coffee plantations, too, under the project.“However, there is a fundamental difference between Andhra Pradesh coffee growers and other states. In our state, it is grown exclusively by tribals for their livelihood, whereas in other states they are grown in coffee estates in lakhs of acres,” Venkateshwar said.The state government represented to the Centre that as coffee plantations in Paderu and Araku areas provide sustainable income resources to primitive tribal households, their activity may be permitted under the MGNREGP. “We pointed out that when the project is applicable for rubber plantations in Kerala, it could be applied to coffee plantations in Araku as well,” Girija Shankar said.As per the MGNREGP guidelines, any plant that is perennial in nature and suitable to the agro-climatic conditions can be brought under the scheme. “Coffee plantation too was taken up as an area-specific work in the tribal areas of Visakhapatnam district where the altitude and climatic conditions favour it,” he said.Stating that the coffee plantation was a game-changer in the tribal areas, the commissioner said delisting it from MGNREGP would adversely impact the livelihood of vulnerable tribals. “Since, as per Land Transfer Regulation Act 1 of 1970, the transfer of tribal land to non-tribals is banned, there is no scope for coffee cultivation by non-tribals in this area,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-delists-works-on-vizag-coffee-plantations-from-nregp-tribal-farmers-in-lurch-101616247875036.html

He had also termed football as symbol of global oneness.Interestingly, Hosabale was elected as the Sarkaryavah at the ABPS held in his home state Karnataka.Though ABPS is held at different places annually, every third year it is held at RSS headquarters in Nagpur for the election of Sarkaryavah, but it was shifted to Bengaluru this time in the wake of surging Covid-19 cases in Maharashtra.According to sources, Hosabale has cordial relations with the top brass of the BJP and the government including Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Home Minister Amit Shah, and is the apt person for the job for having proper coordination.They also said his vast experience in ABVP, the youth wing and in the North East will help the organisation grow.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dattatreya-hosabale-the-second-kannadiga-to-occupy-no-2-position-in-rss-after-h-v-seshadri-101616242462377.html

Asked about the controversy, Sreedharan said the images were clicked when he was being welcomed in a traditional Indian way. Slamming his critics, the 88-year-old candidate said, "It is our Indian tradition. What is wrong with it? They were expressing their respect. They were not worshipping (me)." Attacking Sreedharan, Viswam alleged that the technocrat "glorified" the act of washing his feet. "He is saying it is Indian tradition. This is an example of the direction in which the BJP is taking our country, the political system and democratic values," he told reporters. The CPI leader said India had looked at Sreedharan as "a torchbearer of modern technology", but he changed after entering into the "prison of the politics of the BJP and RSS". Launching his campaign earlier this week, Sreedharan had said BJP is fighting the polls on the plank of development. Sitting MLA Shafi Parambil of the Congress and CPI(M)'s C P Pramod are his main rivals in the election.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/metroman-comes-under-attack-from-left-over-images-of-voters-washing-his-feet-101616238864062.html
20-03-2021||India||CEC hopeful concept of remote voting will see the light of day by next LS polls||Chief Election Commissioner Sunil Arora Saturday expressed hope the concept of remote voting will see "the light of day" by the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, and said that a pilot project could begin in the next two-three months.Addressing an event here, he said, the EC had early this year started a research project for enabling remote voting, in consultation with IIT Madras and eminent technologists from IITs and other leading institutions.Over the last few months, a dedicated team has been working hard for giving shape to this project, he said, adding the concept would hopefully "see the light of day" by 2024 Lok Sabha elections.The first pilot project could be rolled out in the next "two to three months", the CEC said.It needs to be underscored that the project is neither aimed at internet-based voting nor does it imply voting from home, he observed.For the Commission, transparency and confidentiality of voting has always been a guiding consideration in ensuring free, fair and credible elections, he said, adding the Commission will soon be giving shape to the final model of such voting, after due deliberation on various options.This will entail some process changes as well, he said, adding there will be wider consultations with political parties and other stakeholders.Explaining the "blockchain" technology involved in the project, former Senior Deputy Election Commissioner Sandeep Saxena had earlier said the concept is a "two-way electronic voting system in a controlled environment on white-listed IP devices on dedicated Internet lines enabled with biometric devices and a web camera".Saxena, however, had made it clear that voters will have to reach a designated venue during a pre-decided period of time to be able to use this facility.It does not mean voting from home, Saxena had said.On the issue of Commission's proposal to allow eligible overseas Indian voters use one-way electronically transferred postal ballots to cast vote, Arora said after the elections to five assemblies are over, the poll panel would hold a seminar with all stakeholders as suggested by the government.He expressed hope that the concept would materialise in the next six months or a year.At present, non-resident Indians can vote in the constituency in which their place of residence, as mentioned in the passport, is located.Some time ago, the Commission began to look for options to enable NRIs to vote from overseas after it received several requests for expanding their voting options.At the event, Bhartruhari Mahtab (BJD), Supriya Sule (NCP) and Shrirang Appa Barne (Shiv Sena) were given the 'Sansad Maha Ratna Award' for their sustained qualitative overall performance in the 16th Lok Sabha.Twelve Parliamentarians including the Chairman of a Parliamentary Standing Committee on Agriculture were given the Sansad Ratna Awards.The awards were instituted in 2010 by a Chennai-based NGO Prime Point Foundation, and the eMagazine PreSense.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cec-hopeful-concept-of-remote-voting-will-see-the-light-of-day-by-next-ls-polls-101616238315934.html
20-03-2021||India||Youth leaders from Kashmir join People’s Conference||Several youth leaders from Kashmir including a close associate of jailed Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) youth leader Waheed ur Rehman Parra joined the People’s Conference (PC) on Saturday, said PC spokesman Adnan Ashraf.After Arif Amin, Faizan Ellahi, Amaan Zargar and Riyaz Wani joined the party at his Srinagar residence, PC president Sajjad Lone said the youth bolster the belief that change will dawn one day and that the youth will script that change.“While the youthfulness inspires all of us, I feel sad that our youth have been saddled with disempowerment. The youth of today is taking over a legacy which is mired in political disempowerment. We are handing over a very depleted and disempowered J&K and I feel sad that unlike youths in other states enjoying their youthfulness, the youth in J&K have to get together to empower their people and get back their basic rights which have been snatched away”, Lone said.People’s Conference is part of the People’s Alliance for Gupkar Declaration, a front of some mainstream political parties chiefly active in the Kashmir valley. The group has resolved to a political fight to restore Jammu and Kashmir’s statehood and special status enshrined in Article 370, which was abrogated by the Parliament in August 2019. Centre says Article 370 was discriminatory and coming in the way of Jammu and Kashmir’s development.Arif Amin, a prominent youth leader from Pulwama said that they have always been looking for an opportunity to work for the vision of the People’s Conference and its leader Sajad Gani Lone.“We assure that we will work hard to reach out to the people and strengthen the party at the grassroots level and ensure that the ideological and developmental discourse of the party is spread across the youth,” said Amin.Amin is a close associate of the PDP youth president, Waheed-ur- Rehman Parra, who played a key role in drawing youth towards the PDP. Parra is currently in jail after the National Investigation Agency (NIA) arrested him earlier this year. Though he was bailed by a special NIA court, police detained him in another case.PC leaders said in coming days, more prominent leaders from Kashmir will join the People’s Conference. Few days ago, former PDP patron and former MP Muzaffar Baig joined the PC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/youth-leaders-from-south-kashmir-join-people-s-conference-101616237134008.html
20-03-2021||India||Mafia only industry running in Bengal: Modi||Kolkata: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday targeted West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee and her nephew, Abhishek Banerjee, saying when the nation is moving towards a single-window project clearance system to boost industrialisation, the state has introduced a similar mafia-run system.He did not name Abhishek Banerjee but referred to him as bhaipo (nephew in Bengali). “Bengal, too, has a single window system. It is the bhaipo window. Nothing happens in Bengal without passing through this window. A lot of old industries have shut down because of this. The only industry running is the mafia industry,” he said at an election rally at Kharagpur. “Even children know who is behind the illegal mining of sand from the Subarnarekha river. When BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party] comes to power, Bengal will have the rule of law. “Modi alleged Mamata Banerjee has taken away the right to vote. “The world watched how she destroyed your rights during the 2018 panchayat election.” He said the police and administration must remember that nothing is bigger than democracy. “Do not be afraid. Bengal will see real progress. It needs a double engine government to push it forward. It can happen only when the BJP is in power at the state and the Centre.”Abhishek Banerjee, who addressed a Trinamool Congress (TMC) rally at Daspur in the same district less than an hour later, hit back. “Since the Prime Minister is talking of development under a double engine government, he should explain how much progress Uttar Pradesh has seen. We have only seen minor girls being gang-raped and youths being murdered,” Abhishek Banerjee said.“While announcing demonetisation [in 2016], Modi said he will seize all black money in 50 days. He failed to do it in five years. Now, he is talking of developing Bengal in five years. He will not achieve it in 500 years.”He challenged Modi to speak in Bengali for two minutes without using a teleprompter. “I will speak in Hindi without any script or technology for one hour. Let us have this contest anytime, anywhere.” At his second rally at Sabang in West Midnapore district, Abhishek Banerjee threw the language challenge to all BJP national leaders. He added he is ready to go to any BJP-ruled state to face it.Earlier in his 25-minute speech, Modi said voters have given opportunities to many parties over the last 70 years. “Give us five years. Bless us just once. Give us the opportunity to serve you. We will make up for everything that went wrong in 70 years. We will take Bengal to a new path of development,” he said.“...the BJP is indebted to West Bengal. BJP was born out of the Jan Sangh, which was founded by Shyama Prasad Mookerjee. The values and cultures of Asutosh Mookerjee and his son, Shyama Prasad Mookerjee, are in the DNA of the BJP.”He told the gathering that they depended on Mamata Banerjee, but she betrayed their trust and shattered dreams. “Now you see her making new promises,” said Modi. “Didi [Mamata Banerjee], people give you 10 years. You gave them 10 years of misrule and corruption. In Bengal, the cut money system must end.” He said last night, WhatsApp, Instagram etc went down for 50-55 minutes. “People got worried. In Bengal, development stopped 50-55 years ago. Didi’s track record only shows appeasement of some and deprivation of others.”Modi called TMC the school of cruelty. “The syllabus includes syndicate and cut money. People are trained in anarchy. Our country has a new national education policy after 35 years. The entire nation is praising it. It wants to change the education system to suit the demands of the 21st century. It stresses on local language even in technical education, medicine and management. But Didi is opposed to this as well. She is not bothered about the future of youths.”Referring to the TMC’s slogan, khela hobe (let’s play) Modi said, “West Bengal is saying the game will end now and development will begin. People are asking what happened to the money the Centre sent to Bengal. Didi, do not give credit to Modi if you do not want to but why deprive the poor?”The BJP has fielded Bengali actor Hiranmoy Chattopadhyay from the Kharagpur Sadar seat. Dilip Ghosh, the party’s state president, won the seat in 2016. The BJP lost it in the 2019 by-election after Ghosh was elected as a Parliament member.Polls in West Bengal are being held in eight phases between March 27 and April 29.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mafia-only-industry-running-in-bengal-modi-101616234133690.html
20-03-2021||India||Hosabale is RSS’s new general secretary||New Delhi: Dattatreya Hosabale, 67, was on Saturday named as the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS)’s new general secretary replacing Suresh Bhaiyyaji Joshi. The appointment was announced at the ongoing meeting of Akhil Bharatiya Pratinidhi Sabha, the RSS’s highest decision-making body, in Bengaluru.Hosabale was RSS’s joint general secretary since 2009. In 2018, a section of the cadre pushed for a younger and more articulate Hosable to replace Joshi, 73, who had held RSS’s second-in-command position for three terms. Joshi went on to complete his fourth term. Hosabale’s elevation comes ahead of RSS’s centenary celebrations that will begin in 2024. Even as RSS’s footprint has grown across the country, the ideological fountainhead of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is in an expansion mode. It has set a target of opening at least one shakha or unit in every mandal, or a cluster of 10-12 villages, ahead of its 100-year celebrations.Hosbale, who is known for his organising and planning skills, made a mark within the organisation during his stint with RSS’s students’ wing, Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP).He has been given the new crucial position keeping in view the expansion plans and also for the ease with which he balances the Sangh’s ideological position with political pragmatism, said people aware of the reasons for his elevation.“His ability to straddle the Sangh and the BJP are well known and will be put to good use as the Sangh prepares for its expansion as well as acts as a guiding force for the BJP that will also face a test in 2024 [general elections],” said an RSS functionary, requesting anonymity.A second functionary said a larger section of RSS volunteers is under 50. Hosable, who is younger than Joshi, is expected to have a better understanding of the “aspirations and the changed thought process” of the cadre, the functionary added. “While there is no question of diluting the Sangh’s ideology, there is a need to be more inclusive. It was Dattaji who articulated the Sangh’s view on controversial issues such as homosexuality.”In 2016, Hosable said the Sangh does not consider homosexuality a crime. He added it does not need to be punished but treated as a psychological case. Hosable has also said gay marriages amount to institutionalisation of homosexuality and should be prohibited. Popularly known as Datta ji, Hosable is from Karnataka’s Shivamogga. He joined RSS in 1968 and became a full-time ABVP worker in 1978. He served as ABVP’s general secretary for 15 years in Mumbai.Hosable, who has a degree in English literature, was imprisoned for over a year during the state of emergency in the 1970s. Fluent in Kannada, Hindi, English, Tamil, and Sanskrit, Hosbale played a role in setting up the Youth Development Centre in Guwahati, Assam, and World Organisation of Students and Youth.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hosabale-is-rss-s-new-general-secretary-101616231193375.html

20-03-2021||India||Mizoram can't remain indifferent to sufferings of Myanmarese refugees fleeing coup: CM to Centre||Urging the Centre to review its order to four Myanmar-bordering northeastern states including Mizoram to prevent illegal immigration from the neighbouring country and ensure expeditious deportation, Chief Minister Zoramthanga has asserted that the people of his state, who share ethnic ties with the refugees from Chin communities, can't remain indifferent to their plight.The Mizo National Front (MNF) chief, in a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on March 18, requested him to personally intervene in the matter to provide asylum to the political refugees on humanitarian grounds, an official at the Chief Minister's Office said on Saturday.He said the MHA's March 10 advisory to Mizoram, Nagaland, Arunachal Pradesh and Manipur was not acceptable to his state.Though the MNF is a part of the BJP-led North East Democratic Alliance (NEDA), it does not have an alliance with the saffron party in the state."This (MHA advisory) is not acceptable to Mizoram. I understand that there are certain foreign policy issues where India needs to proceed cautiously. However, we cannot ignore this humanitarian crisis," Zoramthanga said in the letter, a copy of which is available with the PTI.He said the areas in Myanmar bordering Mizoram are inhabited by Chin communities who share ethnic ties and have had close contact with the people of the state even before India was independent.Zoramthanga said a human catastrophe of gigantic proportions is happening in Myanmar and innocent citizens are being killed by the military, which is supposed to protect them.Every day, terrified Myanmarese people are struggling to cross over into Mizoram in search of shelter and protection, he said."Therefore, Mizoram cannot just remain indifferent to their sufferings. India cannot turn a blind eye to this humanitarian crisis unfolding right in front of us in our own backyard," the letter read.Zoramthanga said that India, as the world's largest democracy and Myanmar's immediate neighbour, must act in this matter.Meanwhile, Mizoram Rajya Sabha member K Vanlalvena told PTI that the number of Myanmarese refugees taking shelter in the northeastern state has soared to over 1,000.An officer in the state Criminal Investigation Department (CID), however, said that as per official records, a total of 547 Myanmarese have entered Mizoram since the coup on February 1.He said that the actual number may be higher as many Mizoram residents have accommodated Myanmarese refugees without informing the authorities.Myanmarese people fleeing the coup have taken shelter in eight districts and most of them are being handled by local NGOs, he said.Several outfits, including the state's apex student body Mizo Zirlai Pawl (MZP), are raising money to support the refugees.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mizoram-can-t-remain-indifferent-to-sufferings-of-myanmarese-refugees-fleeing-coup-cm-to-centre-101616229759042.html

Johnson will be arriving in India on April 26.It is learnt from reliable sources that Johnson's visit to Chennai has been finalised and his schedule for Tamil Nadu is being worked on. It is also learnt that very soon advance teams from the UK will reach Chennai.Recently, addressing the International Conference on Disaster Resilient Infrastructure (ICDRI 2021), Johnson had lauded Prime Minister Narendra Modi's leadership in areas such as renewable energy in the global fight against climate change."We have a shared vision for a sustainable future for our nations and the global community - and I very much look forward to discussing this and many other issues with Prime Minister Modi on my upcoming visit to India," Johnson said on Wednesday.There is no official announcement on the date of his visit to India and the contours of the visit are still being worked out.The British Prime Minister had cancelled his planned India visit earlier this year due to a surge in Covid-19 cases. He was invited to take part in the Republic Day celebrations as chief guest.He recently announced that Britain would "tilt" its focus towards the Indo-Pacific region as part of its integrated review of government policy for the coming years.India is a high priority for the UK. This is borne by the fact that India will be the first country to be visited by Johnson after Britain's exit from the European Union, a source familiar with developments said.UK is hosting the G7 summit in June where Prime Minister Modi is a special invitee.

This led to a fire in the S5 coach of the New Delhi-Dehradun Shatabdi Special. The incident happened on March 13 near Raiwala in Uttarakhand.Section 167 of the Railways Act specifies that anyone found smoking in a compartment despite prohibition or objection from a co-passenger is liable for a fine of up to ₹100.Union Railway Minister Piyush Goyal in a meeting with Railway Board members and general managers of zones asked them to take proactive steps towards sensitising passengers against smoking in trains and also urged that erring passengers need to be deterred from causing risks to others by smoking in trains."The railways will crackdown on smoking in trains. The fire most likely started in one of the toilets and initial investigations revealed that the fire was in all probability caused by simmering cigarettes/ beedi thrown in the dustbin. The continuous air flow in a fast moving train would have fanned it."We are contemplating severe penalties. In some cases, even arrests can be made for causing damage to public railway property and risking the lives of others to deter irresponsible and errant persons," a senior officer said.The official refused to come on record as the investigation into the incident is still underway.The fire, the officer said was so damaging that the interior of the toilet was completely charred and the floor was cracked.Officers said that a passenger has also provided a written statement to the four- member probe team stating that the smoke detector in coach went off when the fire started."A bigger tragedy was averted by the swift response of the train crew as the coach was detached soon."But we can't let the guard down. So much effort has been made to prevent such incidents. Irresponsible passengers can not be allowed to risk the lives of others," DJ Narain, Spokesperson, Railways, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shatabdi-fire-probe-railways-mulls-severe-penalty-for-smoking-in-trains-if-it-leads-to-property-damage-101616228138309.html
20-03-2021||India||Covid vaccine should be able to give protection for 8-10 months: AIIMS director||The Covid-19 vaccine should be able to give good protection from the infection for eight to ten months, AIIMS director Randeep Guleria said on Saturday.He also said that no major side-effect of the vaccine has been recorded.“The Covid-19 vaccine should be able to give good protection from the infection for eight to ten months and maybe, even more,” Guleria said at an event organised by the IPS (Central) Association.He said the biggest reason for the surge in cases is that people feel the pandemic is over and they are not following Covid-appropriate behaviour."There are multiple reasons for the surge, but the main reason is that there is change in people's attitude and they feel coronavirus is over. People should still restrict non-essential travel for some more time," the official asserted.NITI Aayog member (Health) V K Paul said the chain of transmission has to be stopped and for that vaccine is one tool but another is containment and surveillance strategy."Not following Covid-19 behaviour and laxity is major reason for the surge," he said.Responding to a question on vaccinating more people, Paul said the issue is vaccines are limited and that is why, prioritisation has been done."If we had unlimited supply, we would open the vaccination for everyone. That is the reason, not everyone, is getting vaccinated. Most countries in the world are not able to go beyond priority group because of this reason," he said.The NITI Aayog member also said that the highest mortality was seen among people with co-morbidities and older age groups."These people must not delay taking the vaccine. So the message is that they need it more than others. That is the reason they have been prioritised for getting the Covid-19 vaccine," he said.Talking about the effectiveness of the available Covid-19 vaccines, Covaxin and Covishield, Guleria said, "If we look at the two vaccines, they produce equal antibodies and are very robust. We should take the vaccine available to us because both are equally effective in terms of efficacy and long-term protection.”Over four crore people in the country have been vaccinated against the disease till now. Under the current phase of the inoculation drive, people above 60 years of age and those in the 45-59 years age bracket with co-morbidities, are being vaccinated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-vaccine-should-be-able-to-give-protection-for-8-10-months-aiims-director-101616228607895.html

Till now, the case was being investigated by Maharashtra Police's Anti-terrorism Squad (ATS).The probe was handed over the central investigation agency under section 8 of the NIA Act which says that any connecting offence related to scheduled offence already under investigation can also be taken over by it. The NIA will re-register the Mumbai police FIR in the murder case and take over case file as well as the post-mortem report.Hiran was found dead on March 5 and his body was recovered from Kalwa Creek, hours after his family reported him missing. He had informed the police that the Mahindra Scorpio found outside Antilia, the residence of industrialist Mukesh Ambani in Mumbai, was his. He had reported it stolen on February 18 at Vikroli police station.This is in connection to the explosive laden SUV that was found parked outside Antilia last month.The Maharashtra ATS had lodged a murder case under section 302 (punishment for murder), 201 (causing disappearance of evidence of offence or giving false information to screen offender) 120B (criminal conspiracy) and 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code against unknown persons.Hiran reportedly had written to the home department, Thane police commissioner and Mumbai police commissioner, alleging that he was repeatedly called in for enquiry and that he felt harassed.The autopsy report reserved the opinion on the cause of death, as per officials.

20-03-2021||India||Rajnath says talks with Austin 'fruitful', US defence secretary calls India 'important partner'||US Defence secretary Lloyd J Austin III met his Indian counterpart Rajnath Singh in New Delhi on Saturday and discussed strengthening and elevating defence ties between the two countries. Singh told reporters India is committed to further strengthen its robust defence partnership with the US.After talks concluded, Singh told news agency PTI he urged the US defence equipment manufacturing industry to make good use of the liberalised foreign direct investment (FDI) policies in the defence sector.“I invited the US defence industry to take advantage of India's liberalised FDI policies in the defence sector,” PTI said quoting Singh.Austin reiterated Singh’s words on strengthening ties, stating that his visit was primarily to convey the Biden-Harris administration’s message about the commitment to America’s allies and partners.India was designated as a ‘Major Defence Partner’ by the United States in 2016."I am happy to say that we had comprehensive and fruitful talks with Secretary Austin and his delegation. We are determined to realise full potential of comprehensive global strategic partnership. Talks focussed on wide-ranging defence cooperation, expanding military to military engagement, info sharing and cooperation in emerging areas of defence and mutual logistics support," Rajnath Singh said."We also reviewed many bilateral and multilateral exercises and we agreed for increased cooperation between the Indian military, US Indo-Pacific command, Centre Command and Africa Command. We've signed LEMOA, COMCASA & BECA agreements & we've agreed to realise their full potential," his statement read."India is an increasingly important partner in rapidly shifting international dynamics. I reaffirm our commitment to a comprehensive forward-looking defense partnership with India as a central pillar of our approach to the Indo-Pacific region," Austin said."Our relationship is a stronghold of free & open Indo-Pacific region. PM Modi stated India stands for freedom of navigation & freedom of overflight, unimpeded lawful commerce in adherence to international law. This reaffirms our shared vision for regional security," his statement read.The two countries have signed three important defence and security pacts in the past few years. The Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Agreement (LEMOA), signed in 2016, allows both nations militaries to use each other's bases for repair and replenishment of supplies, which can be later reimbursed. The COMCASA (Communications Compatibility and Security Agreement), inked in 2018 after the first 2+2 dialogue, allows ‘interoperability’ between the two militaries through the transfer of communication security equipment from the US to India.

20-03-2021||India||Mehta ‘was all but forced to quit under pressure’, academics say in open letter||A group of academics from American, Canadian, and British universities has written an open letter saying they are distressed to learn of Pratap Bhanu Mehta’s resignation “under political pressure” from Ashoka University. “It seems that Ashoka’s Trustees, who should have treated defending him [Mehta] as their institutional duty, instead all but forced his resignation,” said the letter to the trustees, administrators, and faculty of Ashoka University.The letter called Mehta a “prominent critic of the current Indian government and defender of academic freedom” and added he had become a target for his writings. It cited Mehta’s resignation letter in which he said his “public writing in support of a politics that tries to honour constitutional values of freedom and equal respect for all citizens is perceived to carry risks for the university.”Mehta, a political commentator, resigned from the university on March 16. Arvind Subramanian, a former chief economic advisor to the government of India, put in his papers as a professor at the university two days later citing the circumstances involving Mehta’s resignation, which he said devastated him. “...someone [Mehta] of such integrity and eminence, who embodied the vision underlying Ashoka, felt compelled to leave is troubling. That even Ashoka—with its private status and backing by private capital—can no longer provide a space for academic expression and freedom is ominously disturbing. Above all, that the University’s commitment to fight for and sustain the Ashoka vision is now open to question makes it difficult for me to continue being part of Ashoka,” said Subramanian, who joined Ashoka University as an economics professor in July 2020 two years after he stepped down as the chief economic advisor. In a separate statement, former Reserve Bank of India governor Raghuram Rajan called free speech the soul of a great university and added “by compromising on it, the founders of Ashoka University have bartered away its soul”. “Ashoka’s founders should have realised that their mission was indeed not to take political sides but to continue to protect the right of people like Pratap Bhanu Mehta to speak, for in doing so, they were enabling Ashoka to make its greatest contribution to India’s wellbeing –– identifying what is wrong and encouraging us all to remedy it,” he wrote on LinkedIn.Rajan also referred to Subramanian’s departure. He added both his and Mehta’s resignation letters suggest the founders of the university have succumbed to outside pressure to get rid of “a troublesome critic.“ “The reality is that Professor Mehta is a thorn in the side of the establishment. He is no ordinary thorn because he skewers those in government and in high offices like the Supreme Court with vivid prose and thought-provoking arguments. It is not that he has much sympathy for the opposition either,” Rajan said.He called Mehta an equal opportunity critic just as how a true academic should be. In their letter, the academics expressed solidarity with Mehta and reaffirmed the importance of the values that he has always practiced. “In political life, these are free argument, tolerance, and a democratic spirit of equal citizenship. In the university, they are free inquiry, candor, and a rigorous distinction between the demands of intellectual honesty and the pressure of politicians, funders, or ideological animus,” the open letter said. “These values come under assault whenever a scholar is punished for the content of public speech. When that speech is in defense of precisely these values, the assault is especially shameful.”The academics underlined the university must be a home for fearless inquiry and criticism. “We support Pratap Bhanu Mehta in his practice of the highest values of intellectual inquiry and public life.”The signatories to the letter include Bruce Ackerman, Yale University, Sana Aiyar, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Danielle Allen, Harvard University, Sunil Amrith, Yale University, and Kwame Anthony Appiah, New York University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mehta-was-all-but-forced-to-quit-under-pressure-academics-say-in-open-letter-101616225853091.html

20-03-2021||India||Dattatreya Hosabale becomes RSS general secretary, replacing Bhaiyyaji Joshi||Dattatreya Hosabale has become the new general secretary of the Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh (RSS), replacing Bhaiyyaji Joshi. The RSS confirmed the development on its Twitter handle on Saturday. The election took place at the two-day meeting of RSS's highest decision-making body, Akhila Bharatiya Pratinidhi Sabha, in Bengaluru.बेंगलुरु : संघ की अखिल भारतीय प्रतिनिधि सभा में सरकार्यवाह पद के लिए श्री दत्तात्रेय होसबाले जी निर्वाचित हुए। वे 2009 से सह सरकार्यवाह का दायित्व निर्वहन कर रहे थे। pic.twitter.com/wEVwGCDaWD73-year-old Bhaiyyaji Joshi became the general secretary in 2009 and completed four terms of three years each. Dattatreya Hosabale is around 65 years old and hails from a family of RSS activists in Karnataka. He joined the RSS in 1968 and, in 1978, became a full-time organiser. In 2004, he became the second in command of the intellectual wing of the RSS.During the Emergency, Dattatreya was arrested under the Maintenance of Internal Security Act (MISA) and was imprisoned for 16 months.Recently at a book release programme of the Sangh, Hosabale said there is only one "DNA in Bharat and that is Hindu". "In the Sangh, Hindu is a "rashtravachak" word. There is one DNA in Bharat and the name of that DNA is Hindu. Hindutva has an identity and those terming themselves secular have propagated it as communal, despite the fact that it is a diverse idea," he said.The annual conclave of the RSS is being held in Bengaluru and not in Nagpur because of the rising Covid-19 cases in Maharashtra.Though Joshi's term has been extended several times in the past, this time it was not feasible because of his age and also because of the upcoming 2024 general elections and the centenary celebrations of the Sangh in 2025.RSS joint general secretary Manmohan Vaidya on Friday said there is a growing curiosity about RSS among the public. "All may not join the Sangh, but they are ready and eager to work with Sangh. The way to engage and involve such people in building a better society along with expanding and planning Sangh work in the next 3 years will be discussed at the ABPS this time," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dattatreya-hosabale-becomes-rss-general-secretary-101616223454040.html

20-03-2021||India||US to give India access to better technologies to meet Indo-Pacific challenge||The Joe Biden administration will provide India access to better capabilities and technologies to enforce the rule of international law in Indo-Pacific, people aware of the development said after US defence secretary Lloyd Austin’s meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi who has described the Indo-US strategic partnership “a force for global good”.The top US defence official landed in New Delhi on Friday evening as part of the Biden administration’s efforts to forge an alliance of countries seeking to push back against China’s assertiveness in the region. He met Prime Minister Modi and National Security Adviser Ajit Doval soon after. Austin is scheduled to meet defence minister Rajnath Singh later on Saturday.“Great meeting with National Security Advisor Ajit Doval last night,” Austin tweeted on Saturday morning. “The breadth of collaboration between our two nations reflects the significance of our major defence partnership as we work together to address the most pressing challenges facing the Indo-Pacific region.”Great meeting with National Security Advisor Doval last night. The breadth of collaboration between our two nations reflects the significance of our Major Defense Partnership as we work together to address the most pressing challenges facing the Indo-Pacific region. pic.twitter.com/DoMZiJDiF1It is understood that the two-hour-long meeting between Secretary Austin and NSA Doval was very positive with both leaders exchanging notes on the security environment in Asia and beyond.“It is in American interest that there is a favourable balance of power in Asia in face of a militarily assertive China. Washington needs to join hands with countries like India whose territorial integrity is being challenged by Beijing,” said a former Indian foreign secretary.Austin’s meetings in New Delhi are a strong contrast to the one held by his two colleagues, US secretary of state Antony Blinken and US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, with their Chinese counterparts in Alaska’s Anchorage. After the first round, both sides publicly skewered each other’s policies in front of TV cameras.It is quite evident from the readouts of the US-China meeting between top diplomats of the two countries that Beijing will continue to assert its growing power all across the globe with what it called the Chinese style of democracy and push back against the US and its allies on all fronts.Secretary Austin’s meeting with PM Modi and NSA Doval has laid the firm foundation for the two countries to enforce international law in the Indo-Pacific bilaterally and through the Quad platform.The leaders of the United States, India, Australia and Japan, who met under the aegis of a grouping known as Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, or Quad held their first summit last week pledged to work together for a free and open Indo-Pacific and to cooperate on maritime and cybersecurity in the face of challenges from China.India and China have been locked in a standoff at multiple locations in the East Ladakh region since May last year after aggressive maneuvres by Beijing’s People’s Liberation Army. The two sides have pulled out troops from the friction points around Pangong Tso but have been unable to move forward in other areas.While no defence deals are expected out of Secretary Austin’s meeting with defence minister Rajnath Singh, the formal meeting will help the visiting dignitary understand Indian future hardware requirements particularly in light of the increasing maritime domain awareness and reaction capabilities in the Indo-Pacific. As of now, the new Joe Biden administration is reviewing US weapon supplies to its partners and the hardware pipeline is set to resume after Secretary Austin returns to Washington.On top of this agenda are 30 weaponised Predator drones to Indian tri-services and six more P8I anti-submarine warfare and surveillance aircraft apart from the possible transfer of technology to make heavier and more powerful engines for twin-engine fighter being developed by the Defence Research and Development Organization under “Atmanirbhar Bharat” initiative. The Indian Navy is already using two unarmed Predator drones for surveillance of the Indian Ocean and beyond to understand and adapt to the technology.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/us-to-give-india-access-to-better-technologies-amid-china-s-assertion-101616217512188.html

Mahabir, the first tiger relocated from a tiger reserve in Madhya Pradesh in June 2018 died due to metal snares laid by poachers that caused deep wounds on its neck.In December 2019, the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) asked the Odisha government to send Sundari back from Satkosia, accusing the state forest and wildlife department of messing up the monitoring and management of the relocated tigress by not following the standard operating procedure.In December last year, MP chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan wrote to Odisha chief minister Naveen Patnaik alleging that Sundari lost its natural instinct and behaviour due to improper handling in Odisha.“A team sent to Odisha to take back the tigress found that Sundari has lost its wild nature due to prolonged confinement and presence of humans around her. If it is released into the wild again, it would be dangerous for the animal as well as humans. Therefore, I request you to ensure proper care of the tigress until we have prepared fully to take it back and shift it to Ghorela centre,” Chouhan wrote to Patnaik.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tigress-in-odisha-to-return-to-mp-after-failure-of-translocation-exercise-101616213852384.html
20-03-2021||India||Inter-state job racket busted in Odisha, 5 arrested||Odisha police claim to have busted an inter-state racket that was cheating youth by promising non-existent jobs in Tata industries in return for money with the arrest of five persons from Jamshedpur in Jharkhand, said police officials. Angul superintendent of police Jagmohan Meena said the job racket spanned Odisha, Jharkhand, West Bengal, Maharashtra, Bihar and lured unemployed youth into paying up to ₹8 lakh in the hope of employment in respectable engineering companies. A 62-year-old man and his 29-year-old son were among those arrested while they were in the process of circulating fake recruitment forms to aspirants.The job fraud first came to the notice of police last month when 59-year-old Pranabandhu Jena of Angul district alleged that in 2018, a man known as Mishra took ₹ 450,000/- in cash from him with the promise to engage his son at TATA Industries, Jamshedpur. However, he could not provide any job to his son. When Jena asked Mishra for a refund, he returned only about ₹80,000 in three instalments while threatening and abusing him. Operating since 2018, the accused are believed to have cheated scores of people.In December last year, Odisha police arrested former BJD minister Pradeep Panigrahy for his alleged involvement in defrauding around 100 youths of Ganjam district in the name of providing jobs in Tata Motors. Panigrahy, who is still behind bars, allegedly took up to ₹10 lakh from each of the aspirants.Two days ago, a conman posing as the director of Bloomberg TV channel was arrested in Bhubaneswar for allegedly cheating a youth of ₹1.3 lakh on the pretext of giving him a job. Odisha’s unemployment rate has increased by 10.7 percentage points, rising to 23.8% in Apr 2020, according to a survey conducted by the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/interstate-job-racket-busted-in-odisha-5-arrested-101616210731758.html

20-03-2021||India||2nd wave of Covid-19: These states shut schools once again as cases rise||A year after classrooms were shifted to the online space because of the outbreak of Covid-19, the situation remains the same in many states as physical classes are being suspended once again in the wake of the second wave of the pandemic.Most education institutions suspended physical classes in March 2020 around the time when the nationwide lockdown was announced. After a gap of six months, the Centre allowed states to take a decision on the resumption of physical classes in September. Reviewing the ground situation, states resumed offline classes only if parents give the consent to send their wards to the schools. The process of reopening spanned from September to January, but as cases in India started surging in February, authorities are choosing to suspend physical classes. This comes at a time when students are all set to appear for their annual exams, board exams etc.List of states which have already closed schoolsPunjabTill March 31, all educational institutions of Punjab will remain closed. Only medical and nursing colleges will remain open. The worst-affected districts of the state are Ludhiana, Jalandhar, Patiala, Mohali, Amritsar, Hoshiarpur, Kapurthala, SBS Nagar, Fatehgarh Sahib, Ropar and Moga. On Friday, Punjab reported 2,490 infections.PondicherryAll schools for classes 1 to 8 in this Union territory will remain closed between March 22 and May 31.GujaratThe Gujarat government this week has asked all schools in Ahmedabad, Rajkot, Vadodara, Surat, Bhavnagar, Gandhinagar, Jamnagar and Junagadh to switch to only online classes till April 10. Tuition classes in the cities have also been closed till April 10.MaharashtraSchools in districts that are under lockdown and restrictions are shut, according to local lockdown rules. Schools, colleges in Pune are closed till March 31. All schools, hostels, colleges in the Palghar district have been closed till further order. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation has asked all schools under its jurisdiction to switch to online platforms.How schools/hostels are becoming Covid-19 hotspotsResidential schools in many states have reported a cluster outbreak of the infection in the past month. Though schools have been allowed to reopen hostels after thorough sanitising and ensuring that all Covid-19 guidelines are being followed, sharing of common space is being seen as the reason behind the outbreaks. Many cases are asymptomatic as well, making it difficult to track.Such cluster outbreaks were reported when schools reopened for the first time after a lockdown in September, October. But the situation was brought under control in November as overall cases came down in November-December.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-2nd-peak-these-states-are-shutting-schools-once-again-as-cases-rise-101616206015134.html
20-03-2021||India||Govt wants WhatsApp privacy policy blocked||The Union government on Friday urged the Delhi high court to restrain WhatsApp from implementing its new privacy policy, contending the rules were vague, failed to protect user data from being shared with third parties, and did not guarantee deletion of all data once users withdrew their consent.A bench of chief justice DN Patel and justice Jasmeet was told by the Centre in an affidavit that though the rules framed in 2011 under the Information Technology Act prohibits sharing of information with third parties, WhatsApp has stated that data and information will be freely shared with and received by other companies owned by Facebook.It said that no details were given about the third parties with whom the information will be shared, and submitted that since the contract of a user is only with WhatsApp, all other Facebook companies are “third parties” and any sharing of data between them amounts to a violation.The matter will be heard on April 20.“WhatsApp has stated that data and information will be freely shared with and received from other Facebook companies. Since the contract of the user is only with WhatsApp, all other Facebook companies are ‘third parties’ and any inter-sharing of data obtained by it will amount to violation of the restriction on further disclosure,” it added.The controversy relates to the company’s decision in January to enforce a new privacy policy that will allow it to share some data about users’ interactions with business accounts with its parent company Facebook, and that accepting these terms were mandatory in order to use the service.WhatsApp was under fire by critics who said users will now not have an option but to consent to the sharing if they want to keep using the application. The company pushed back the roll-out of the policy to May 15 but reiterated in February that it will go ahead with its decision. This came despite the government writing a letter, asking the company to abandon its plans.In its affidavit, the government also told the court that the new privacy policy does not provide the opportunity to review or amend the full information submitted by a user, pointing out that the changes allowed to be made are limited to the name, picture, mobile number and “about” information.“The privacy policy is completely silent on correction/ amendment of information. It appears to provide an option to further manage, change, limit or delete your information of the policy, but upon close perusal, it is apparent that this ability is limited to a user’s profile name, picture, mobile number and the about information. For the policy to be compliant with the Rules, it must allow the users to exercise this option for all kinds of data collected by WhatsApp which are mentioned in the policy. The impugned privacy policy thus fails to fulfil these obligations,” the affidavit said.WhatsApp did not respond to requests for a comment.The Centre’s response came on a plea by Seema Singh through advocate Meghan, challenging the new WhatsApp privacy policy. The plea sought directions to the authorities to provide an option to opt out of sharing data with Facebook.Reacting to the Union government’s response, advocate Meghan said: “The three rights prayed before the court to be declared authoritatively have not been talked about in the counter affidavit.” The three were the right to seek confirmation, access and rectification; to objection, restriction and portability of the data; and to be forgotten as part of Article 21 and the intrinsic to the right to privacy.He also said the government has not proposed any measure to protect user privacy in the interim. “The mechanism to protect the citizen’s privacy in the interim has also not been heeded in the counter affidavit,” she added.The Centre cited the 2011 IT Act rules to contend that the updated privacy policy fails to specify the types of “sensitive personal” data being collected, and with whom the information was being shared.The government said that, in accordance with law, WhatsApp is required to explain the types of “personal” and “sensitive personal” information, but WhatsApp has used general terms to enlist the kinds of data collected, and made no distinction between “personal” data or “sensitive personal” data.According to the 2011 rules, there are eight categories of information that qualify as sensitive personal data, including user passwords, financial instrument and transaction information, and biometrics information.On January 15, a law student, Chaitanya Rohilla, too challenged the new privacy policy. WhatsApp initially made it mandatory for the users to accept the conditions by February 8.The Delhi high court, while hearing Rohilla’s plea, on January 18 observed that WhatsApp is a private application, and it was not mandatory for people to not download it if they had problems with its privacy policy.Experts welcome the government’s stand and said it was a unique decision. “WhatsApp updated privacy policy, from the perspective of a user, is a chaotic indication to disaster. It is stripping an individual from his right to privacy. Till now, the information was being shared only with the Facebook Group of companies, but now the data will also be shared with third parties and entities whom you have never had a relationship,” said advocate Pavan Duggal.“It is heartening to see the stand of the government because normally, they don’t take such stands. But here the contraventions are so deliberate and intentional, that the government has no choice to take this stand because it has to protect the privacy of the citizens. Also the government can take action against WhatsApp under the new IT rules brought on February 25,” he added.A WhatsApp spokesperson reiterated that the update in question "doesn't expand" company's ability to share data with Facebook. “As we said in January when this matter was first raised: we wish to reinforce that this update does not expand our ability to share data with Facebook. Our aim is to provide transparency and new options available to engage with businesses so they can serve their customers and grow. WhatsApp will always protect personal messages with end-to-end encryption so that neither WhatsApp nor Facebook can see them. We are working to address misinformation and remain available to answer any questions.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-wants-whatsapp-privacy-policy-blocked-101616199308268.html

The Sunday lockdown returned after seven months. Earlier, the state government had imposed a lockdown every Sunday in August. MP chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan said that the lockdown has been imposed to curb the infection cycle as it would be effective for 30 hours considering that night curfew is already there in these districts.“The lockdown will also help us to tell people about the seriousness of the second Covid-19 wave and create awareness about wearing masks and social distancing,” the CM said.“There will be complete lockdown in these three districts from 10 pm on Saturday to 6 am on Monday.

20-03-2021||India||Relief for Naidu as HC stays CID probe in Amaravati land case||Hyderabad The Andhra Pradesh High Court on Friday ordered a stay on a probe into a case by the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) against former chief minister and Telugu Desam Party (TDP) chief N Chandrababu Naidu and former minister P Narayana in the alleged Amaravati land case. On Thursday, both the leaders had filed separate petitions in the court, seeking quashing of the March 12 FIR in which Naidu has been named as accused no. 1 and Narayana as accused no. 2. The case pertains to pooling of land for the development of the state’s new capital Amaravati in 2015. The CID had served notices to Naidu and Narayana, asking them to appear before the designated officer on March 23 and March 22, respectively, for probe in the case. The agency also threatened to arrest them if they did not cooperate in the investigation process. Appearing on behalf of Naidu, senior Supreme Court advocate Siddharth Luthra argued that the government order to acquire lands assigned to Dalit farmers was issued under AP Capital Region Development Act as part of land pooling for the construction of the capital.“Sections 166 (public servant disobeying the law) and 167 (public servant framing incorrect document) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) invoked by the CID to book cases against Naidu are not applicable in the present case. Secondly, the government order was issued as part of the land acquisition procedure and was ratified by the then chief minister 35 days later. How can the CID say that it was issued on the instructions of Naidu?” he argued. The counsel for Naidu also pointed out that the FIR had failed to mention from where the government had allegedly forcibly taken the land belonging to the Scheduled Castes (SCs) and Scheduled Tribes (STs) and who had lodged a complaint in this regard. Former advocate general Dammalapati Srinivas, who argued on behalf of Narayana, said the case was politically-motivated. “The government order was issued following a proposal by the then Guntur collector based on the representation given by the Dalit farmers. How can the cases be registered under the SC/ST Atrocities Act when the order was meant to provide benefits to the Dalits?” he said. The two counsels for the petitioners urged the court to give a direction to the CID not to go ahead with any measures, including probe and arrests in the case. Justice Roy asked the investigating agency to produce prima facie evidence against Naidu and Narayana. In response, the counsel for CID, Jasti Nagabhushanam said no details could be revealed at this stage and further probe was required to prove the charges against the accused. After hearing the arguments, the high court granted the stay on the probe until further orders. Welcoming the stay order, TDP politburo member and spokesperson Varla Ramaiah said: “The court’s stay order once again showed show the Jagan regime was bent on filing motivated cases to seek revenge against Naidu.” YSRCP general secretary V Vijay Sai Reddy said Naidu should face the investigation and come out clean, if he had not committed any crime, instead of obtaining stay orders from the court. “In every case against him, Naidu is surviving by obtaining stay orders. He does not have the guts to face the investigation and prove that he is not guilty,” Reddy said. The FIR was registered on the basis of a complaint by YSRCP MLA Alla Ramakrishna Reddy, who represents Mangalagiri assembly constituency which is part of Amaravati, on February 24. Besides 166 and 167, Naidu was booked under sections 120 B (conspiracy) and 217 (public servant disobeying law with intent to save a person from punishment or property from forfeiture) of IPC.The TDP chief was also booked under SC and ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989 and Section 7 of the AP assigned land (Prevention of Transfer) Act, 1977.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/relief-for-naidu-as-hc-stays-cid-probe-in-amaravati-land-case-101616179347203.html
20-03-2021||India||Andhra plans ordinance route to meet govt expenditure||Hyderabad Instead of presenting the full budget, the Andhra Pradesh government is likely to take the ordinance route to seek a vote-on-account for the initial few months of the financial year 2021-22 to meet the government expenditure, citing the impending by-poll to the Tirupati Lok Sabha seat on April 17 as reason. If this happens, it will be the second year in a row that the state has had to resort to the ordinance route. It is mandatory for the state assembly to approve the annual budget for the upcoming financial year and ensure passage of the Appropriation Bill before the closure of the current financial year on March 31. With barely two weeks left, the Jagan Mohan Reddy-led YSRCP government is yet to take any decision on the budget session of the state assembly.“We have not yet taken a call on the budget session of the assembly but it is unlikely that the session will be held under present circumstances (before the by-poll),” senior YSRCP leader and government chief whip in the state assembly G Srikanth Reddy said. He added that holding the session before the election would cause inconvenience not only to the government but also the opposition parties. “We are also insisting on the completion of the elections to the zilla parishad and mandal parishad (block parishad) at the earliest. Amidst the elections, it may not be possible to hold a full-fledged budget session,” he said. The only option left before the Jagan government is to promulgate an ordinance through the Governor under Article 213 (1) of the Constitution of India for the adoption of a vote-on-account budget for appropriation of money and release of approximate budgetary allocations for at least three months. An Appropriation Bill gives power to the government to withdraw funds from the Consolidated Fund of India for meeting the expenses during the financial year. Without the passage of this bill in the assembly, the state government will not be able to withdraw any money from the exchequer from April 1 for the implementation of various welfare programmes and payment of salaries to the state employees. The state cabinet is expected to meet next week to adopt a draft ordinance to pass the vote-on-account for the first three months of the new financial year and get it approved by Governor Biswa Bhushan Harichanan. “Instead of rushing through the budget, we can have a full session at a later date and the budget can be passed after a thorough discussion in the House,” the chief whip said. Last year too, the Jagan government was unable to convene the budget session in early March as it was planning to hold the same in the last week after the completion of elections to urban and rural local bodies. The state election commission, however, deferred polls in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic and before the government could decide anything, the Union government declared a nationwide lockdown. Subsequently, the government promulgated an ordinance for the vote-on-account for three months. In the second week of June, it held a short two-day session to adopt the budget. The Governor later addressed the joint session of the assembly and council through video-conferencing mode.However, the appropriation bill, which was passed by the assembly, was withheld in the legislative council. Two weeks later, the bill was deemed to have been passed and the Governor gave his assent to the same. In Telangana, the budget session for the upcoming financial year began on March 15. The government tabled the budget on Thursday and is now preparing for a debate on the same from Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/andhra-plans-ordinance-route-to-meet-govt-expenditure-101616179346615.html

Other promises in the manifesto include a ₹5,000-crore coastal area development package to protect the shores from erosion, increasing the minimum support price for rubber to ₹250 per kg, building 1.5 lakh houses for the homeless and attaining self-sufficiency in production of eggs, milk and vegetables.Vijayaraghavan claimed that the “biggest achievement” of the Pinarayi Vijayan government was providing a “corruption-free” regime, and asserted that the state government took all measures to protect secular and democratic ideals of the country. “We are sure about the next five years. All poll surveys have also indicated this,” he said. He further claimed that among the 600 promises made in the 2016 manifesto, 580 have been fulfilled. He, however, refused to comment on the contentious Sabarimala issue. During the three-month long annual pilgrimage season in 2018, the state witnessed large-scale violence and five shutdowns when the state government tried to enforce the Supreme Court verdict annulling a decades-old bar on the entry of women between the ages of 10 and 50 into the Sabarimala temple. After the protests, revision petitions were filed in the Supreme Court, which were referred to a nine-member Constitution bench. The Opposition Congress-led United Democratic Front, however, termed the manifesto a bundle of unfinished tasks and empty promises. “Development took a back seat in five years. Only families of communist leaders prospered and wives of many got plum posts defying all norms. Youngsters are still protesting before the state secretariat against back door entry in government services,” said UDF convener and senior Congress leader M M Hassan. He added that the UDF manifesto will be released in a couple of days. Senior Congress leader Shashi Tharoor, who is the convener of the manifesto committee for the party, has toured the state extensively to ascertain the key issues facing the local residents.Elections to the 140-member Kerala assembly in 14 districts will be held in a single phase on April 6. The counting of votes will be held on May 2.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ldf-offers-pension-for-homemakers-101616179286634.html
20-03-2021||India||CBI files charge sheet against four officials for ‘bribe-for-relief’ racket||The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Friday filed a charge sheet against four officers for allegedly running a “bribe-for-relief” racket within the agency.The accused officers were identified as Deputy Superintendents of Police (DSPs), RK Sangwan and RK Rishi, inspector Kapil Dhankad and stenographer Sameer Kumar Singh. While Singh was arrested on Thursday and sent to judicial custody, the other three officers were arrested in January.The agency has said that the accused officers were leaking confidential information to companies under investigation for bank frauds since 2018.According to the FIR, reviewed by HT, the four officers, along with two advocates and some other accused were “compromising the integrity of the investigation of certain cases on extraneous pecuniary considerations”.“Details of the investigation of many other cases, including confidential notes and directions, have been communicated by (Sameer Kumar) Singh to Sangwan and Rishi on pecuniary considerations to protect the interests of the accused,” the FIR stated. The agency has also identified bribes worth ₹55 lakh paid to Rishi ( ₹30 lakh) and Dhankad ( ₹25 lakh).The two DSPs facilitated the bribes by leaking the information to the companies under investigation, said an officer, speaking on condition of anonymity.“The leak of sensitive case-related information like raids, status of investigation, filing of charge sheet, etc., helps accused persons in destroying the evidence. There is a possibility that more officers are involved in the scandal as CBI investigations are monitored at various levels and documents are usually kept in respective branches. It is to be seen how Singh was leaking the documents without anyone’s knowledge,” a CBI officer had told HT in January.The accused persons’ legal representatives could not be reached for comments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cbi-files-charge-sheet-against-four-officials-for-bribe-for-relief-racket-101616179106530.html
20-03-2021||India||Search begins for 4 tigers of Ranthambore reserve||Jaipur: The Ranathambore Tiger Reserve administration has started an intensive search for at least four missing tigers, not sighted for the past year, even as Tiger Watch, whose volunteers track and monitor tigers in the reserve said on Twitter that the number was actually higher, at seven. In a major setback to tiger conservation in Rajasthan, four tigers including two sub-adults have been reported missing from RTR in Sawai Madhopur district of Rajasthan, officials admitted .When a tiger is missing for such a long period of time, it is very likely that it has died, experts said with the possible causes being infighting, poisning by villages upset at losing cattle to the big cats, or even poaching. The RTR administration has not sighted 11-year-old tiger, T-64, tigress T-73 (9-years-old), and her two sub-adult cubs for the past year. The forest department is making efforts to trace them. The officials said the last movement of the tigers were in the non-tourism zone and that they were last camera trapped in March 2020. The two sub-adults were from the second litter of T-73. RTR Field Director, TC Verma said, “We have written to nearby forest divisions, and Kuno Palpur in Madhya Pradesh to look for and inform us if the tigers are cited.”RTR’s 76 tigers including 21 cubs and sub-adults live in an area of 1,334 square kms, making it third most congested habitats for the big cats in India after Corbett National Park in Uttarakhand and Kaziranga National Park in Assam. The ‘Status of Tigers in India-2018’ report said that Rajasthan has witnessed an increase of tiger population by 115% in the last 12 years. “The tigers were last seen in Darra, Kundra, Badlav and Jakhra area of RTR, where currently Tigress-103 (four-year-old) and male young tigers T-112-113 are moving. There are possibilities that they are pushed out by them, or died in territorial fight,” a senior official said, requesting anonymity.In the past 10 years, over 26 big cats have gone missing from RTR. Till date, none of these tigers have been found. Retired forest services official Sunanyan Sharma said that overcrowding of the reserve is part of the problem and added that the only solution for effective tiger conservation is relocation, after developing the habitat. Dharmendra Khandal of Tiger Watch said all four tigers going missing was a serious issue. “Human threat to big cats cannot be ruled out. Territorial fights among tigers is normal but all these were in prime age and not old,” he said. Khandal blamed the lack of monitoring for such occurrences and suggested that a new protocol be put in place for a fortnight review of tiger’s status and location.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/search-begins-for-4-tigers-of-ranthambore-reserve-101616179107201.html

20-03-2021||India||Superspreader events like weddings behind new Covid surge: Govt panel||Superspreader events such as weddings appear to have driven the resurgence of Covid-19 in India, according to preliminary assessments by the Union government that has also found people becoming less careful in recent months when the outbreak had receded to its lowest levels after the virus first emerged in India.On Friday, India recorded more than 40,000 cases – the highest since late November. This number is close to four times the roughly 11,000 being recorded on an average every day in the second week of February.“That (role of superspreader events) is what it looks like, as people have become lax in their behaviour. We must understand that there is still a large section of population that is vulnerable, especially in villages. We cannot afford to lower our guard at this stage, and should avoid mass gatherings as it can become superspreading events,” said Dr VK Paul, member (health), Niti Aayog.“Also, testing, especially RT-PCR testing has to increase in districts that are reporting high positivity rate,” he added.State authorities in Punjab said they had found at least 30 super-spreader instances, where more than 10 cases were recorded from a single event.State’s nodal officer for Covid-19, Dr Rajesh Bhaskar, said exact details about these events were not available but cited some instances: a wedding in a family from Amritsar in Delhi, which led to 20 infections from 38 who were tested; a funeral in Mohali, in which eight of 18 tested were positive, and an office of the Punjab government in Chandigarh where nearly 70 of 132 employees tested were found infected.“In around 75-80% of the cases, patients were found asymptomatic or with mild symptoms. Contact tracing, after one person from the event was found, led to detection in these functions,” said the nodal officer, who asked not to be named.Doctors in Delhi also blame weddings, social outings and get-togethers for the current surge in cases.“I have personally seen several cases where groups of people got the infection at a wedding. There are cases where five to six people in one group who travel for a destination wedding get it. Then, there are kitty parties where four to five people have contracted the infection. We need to change our behaviour, there is no other way to control the spread of the infection. These events are not a necessity and should be avoided,” said Dr Surajit Chaterjee, senior consultant, internal medicine at Indraprastha Apollo hospital.Dr GC Khilnani, former head of the department of pulmonary medicine at All India Institute of Medical Sciences and chairman of PSRI Institute of Pulmonary and Critical care, said, “There was euphoria among people when the number of infections in the city went down as does in any viral infection naturally. With over 50% of the population exposed to the infection, the transmission slowed down. But, people gathering for events such as weddings led to an increase. This is exactly what happened after Dussera and Diwali.”He said he has seen super-spreading events where thirty to forty people at a wedding party contracted the infection.Sars-Cov-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, has been established to spreads through droplets and as aerosolised. So, whenever people eat in groups and pull down their mask, the risk of contracting the infection is very high. Plus, air-conditioned environments are the worst as the virus can remain airborne for 3 to 16 hours if there isn’t proper ventilation.“Festivals and wedding are a hotbed for infections as people tend to forget to take precautions. I know of instances where 40 to 50 people in a wedding got the infection,” said Dr Rommel Tickoo, director of internal medicine at Max healthcare.A large gathering of people in a funeral turned into a superspreading event in a south Indian state recently, when 33 people got infected after attending a funeral in Karimnagar district of Telangana on February 18.“The mass infection was due to people not following of Covid-19 guidelines such as social distancing and wearing masks,” said G Srinivas Rao, director of health.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/superspreader-events-like-weddings-behind-new-covid-surge-govt-panel-101616177606318.html
20-03-2021||India||Scale up climate crisis finance commitments: Sitharaman to advanced economies||Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Friday called on advanced economies to honour their climate change financing commitments, saying that their obligation to mobilise 100 billion dollars a year to fulfil the needs of developing countries is “meager” and remained largely “unfulfilled”.The minister was speaking at the concluding session of the International Conference on Disaster Resilient Infrastructure when she said: “Multilateral negotiations and multilateral institutions have played a critical role in climate change finance-related matters. The Paris Agreement also recognizes the pivotal role that finance plays in being conscious about the resilient nature of infrastructure we need to build.”She added: “I think the resources being given to developing countries is something on which discussion has happened. For developed countries, it underlines their continued obligation under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). These commitments will have to be honoured.”The minister further said: “The much discussed commitment of 100 billion dollars a year is something which advanced economies will have to recognise. According to observers and also people who watch developing countries struggle to keep their commitments on the Paris Agreement, finance is an issue, 100 billion a year is a meagre amount. The commitment is meagre and needs to be ramped up. This 100 billion dollar a year commitment is not even close to being fulfilled.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fm-to-advanced-economies-scale-up-climate-crisis-finance-commitments-101616176946238.html

20-03-2021||India||Gold smuggling case: Kerala police book ED for ‘forcing’ accused to name Vijayan||The Kerala police on Friday filed a complaint against officials of the Enforcement Directorate (ED) for allegedly forcing Swapna Suresh, main accused in sensational gold smuggling case, to give a statement against chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan, an unusual move for a police department, but understandable in the context of the coming assembly elections.The FIR said ED officials questioned Suresh on August 13 and 14 last year and allegedly forced to her to give a statement implicating the chief minister. The case has been registered under sections 120 B (criminal conspiracy), 167 (public servant framing an incorrect document with intent to cause injury), 192 (fabricating false evidence), 195-A (threatening any person to give false evidence) of the Indian Penal Code. A senior ED official, who asked not to be named said the latest move is aimed at intimidating the agency’s officials and that ED will seek legal remedies.The state’s ruling Left Democratic Front government has maintained that the investigation is coloured by politics, but the main opposition in Kerala, the Congress-led United Democratic Front has said that the police case itself is aimed at diverting attention from burning issues.The case surfaced in last July after 30kg gold was seized from a consignment sent in diplomatic baggage in UAE consulate in the state capital. Later, several people, including chief minister’s principal secretary M Sivasankar, a senior IAS officer, were arrested for helping the accused; Suresh was labelled the mastermind behind the plan.Last month, the customs department filed an affidavit in Kerala high court quoting Suresh’s statement under the Section 164 of the Indian penal code in which she alleged that the CM, three of his ministers and Speaker were aware of smuggling activities through the consulate. Later, the state attorney general sent a show-cause notice to the customs commissioner asking why contempt proceedings should not be initiated against him.In November, a video clip purported to be of Swapna Suresh was leaked from the jail where she is housed, in which she alleged that she was under tremendous pressure to take the name of many ministers and the CM. Later, two women police officers who escorted her also claimed that they were witness to ED officials forcing her to name important personalities including the CM.“I heard a senior ED official named Radhakrishnan promised Swapna Suresh that she would be made an approver in the case if she named the CM. He also forced her to say the money recovered from her locker was handed over to her by Sivasankar,” one of the women civil police officers wrote in a statement to the crime branch. K Radhakrishnan is the ED assistant director in Kochi investigating the case.But the ED denied these claims.HT has not independently verified the authenticity of the video.On March 4, the crime branch sought legal opinion and got the nod to book ED officials. In the First Information Report (FIR), the crime branch said it has clinching evidence against ED officials.“We will examine our legal options. If needed, we might even go to the court against such a move,” an ED official said, requesting anonymity.The Congress and the BJP said the move by the state government is aimed at diverting attention and weaken the case. “The ruling CPI(M) is cornered from all sides in smuggling case and Sabarimala issue. The case is a diversionary tactic,” said state Congress chief Mullappally Ramachandran.“The nervous CM is intimidating officials of the central agencies. It will not work,” said state BJP chief K Surendran.But CPI(M) state acting secretary A Vijayaraghavan said the state won’t allow free run of the central agencies to discredit the government in the midst of the polls. “We will tell people about their nefarious designs,” he said. Kerala goes to the polls on April 6 and the results will be announced on May 2.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gold-smuggling-case-kerala-police-book-ed-for-forcing-accused-to-name-cm-vijayan-101616173765658.html
20-03-2021||India||3 states face risk of being next Covid-19 hot spots||With the Covid-19 outbreak in Maharashtra already spiralling to near-record levels in recent days, three states—Punjab, Haryana and Madhya Pradesh – appear to face the immediate risk of becoming the next hot spots of the disease, with a high growth rate of cases and rising positivity rates, according to an HT analysis.To identify the new hot spots of the outbreak, HT analysed data from India’s 20 most populous regions, looking for three factors—a rising positivity rate, a high growth rate of daily cases, and low tests per million residents—that have marked all hot spots globally.HT also analysed the change in the seven-day average of daily new cases at the district level based on data compiled by How India Lives. Statistics at both the district and state levels show that western regions of the country have a seen a higher surge in cases than eastern regions.Unsurprisingly, the statistics in Maharashtra, the state which has been reporting a massive increase in new infections in the past week, are alarming.The seven-day average of positivity rate in the state went from 7% for the week ending February 16 to 16.4% for the week ending March 17. In fact, the state has nearly four times the positivity rate of any other state in the list. The seven-day average of new Covid-19 cases, also known as case trajectory, in the state grew 426% in the last 30 days—the second highest among the states analysed.Three emerging hotspotsPunjab emerged as the state with some of the most worrying overall numbers, highlighting how the state may be far from seeing the worst of the outbreak. The daily case trajectory in the state grew 531% in the last 30 days (the highest in the country), while its weekly average positivity rate went up 4.7 percentage points in the same time period, the second-highest increase in India only after Maharashtra.Haryana saw the third-highest rate of increase in case rate in the country after Punjab and Maharashtra—398% rise in case rate in the past 30 days. The state also saw its average positivity rate go up 2.2 percentage points.In Madhya Pradesh, the daily case rate went up 277%, while the average positivity rate rose 3.3 percentage points. Another problematic statistic for the state, however, was its testing rate—in the past week, the state conducted 191 tests per million per day, one of the lowest in the country.Positivity rateIn 19 of the 20 states analysed, the Covid-19 positivity rate—the proportion of people testing positive to those tested—was found rising in the last month. The seven-day average of positivity rate across India rose by 1.4 percentage points in the past 30 days—from 1.7% for week ending February 16 to 3.1% in the past week.So far, the four states mentioned above—Maharashtra, Punjab, Madhya Pradesh and Haryana—are the only regions where the positivity rate rose higher than the national average of 1.4 percentage points. A majority of the regions saw a very marginal increase in positivity rates in the past 30 days.Kerala was the only state that saw its positivity rate improve—it dropped 3.8 percentage points, from 7.1% in mid-February to 3.3% in the last seven days.Resurgence of casesThe seven-day average of new Covid-19 cases across India has risen 140% in the past 30 days (from 11,235 cases a day for week ending on February 16 to 26,991 a day on March 17)—a statistic that reflects the start of the second wave of infections.Other than the four states mentioned above, the case rate is rising at worrying levels in Andhra Pradesh (276% higher in the past 30 days), Delhi (225%) and Gujarat (224%).At the other end of spectrum lie Kerala, Bihar and Odisha—their the seven-day average of cases dropped 63%, 25% and 9% respectively. These were the only three states where the case trajectory receded in the past month.Rising case rate, by districtThe 707 districts (with 11 districts of Delhi merged as one) for which this data is compiled by How India Lives can be broadly divided into three categories on the basis of how their seven-day average of daily new cases has changed in the past month. This average was zero for about a quarter of districts (162) on both February 16 and March 17. For a similar number of districts (182 in all), the average of daily new cases either remained the same or saw a decline. However, a majority of districts (363) saw an increase. Seventy-seven of these 363 districts registered an increase from zero average daily cases a month ago.Consolidated, time-series data on testing at the district-level was not available.The share of districts that saw the most increase from non-zero cases (above 385%) among total districts of the state is the highest in Punjab, Maharashtra , Haryana, Andhra Pradesh, and Madhya Pradesh. In these states, 82%, 58%, 36%, 31%, and 16% of the districts respectively were of the category that can be classified among those that saw the most increase nationally in the daily average of new cases.The states with the highest share of districts that had zero average new cases a month ago and had the same average on March 17 are Goa and all the north-eastern states. Among large states, it is the eastern states of Jharkhand and Odisha that have a higher share of districts in this category than the rest of the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/3-states-face-risk-of-being-next-hot-spots-101616092276289.html
