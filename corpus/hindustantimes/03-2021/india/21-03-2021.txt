21-03-2021||India||PM Modi to launch 'Catch the Rain' campaign on Monday||Prime Minister Narendra Modi will launch the "Jal Shakti Abhiyan:Catch the Rain" campaign on the World Water Day on Monday.The historic MoU to implement the Ken Betwa Link Project, the first project of the national perspective plan for interlinking of rivers, will also be signed by Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh chief ministers at the event.The PMO said in a statement that the campaign will be undertaken across the country in both rural and urban areas with the theme "catch the rain, where it falls, when it falls". It will be implemented from March 22 to November 30 - the pre-monsoon and monsoon period in the country. It will be launched as a 'Jan Andolan' (public movement) to take water conservation at the grassroot level through people's participation. It is intended to nudge all stakeholders to create rainwater harvesting structures suitable to climatic conditions and subsoil strata, to ensure proper storage of rainwater, the PMO said. After the event, gram sabhas will be held in all gram panchayats of each district (except in poll-bound states) to discuss issues related to water and water conservation. Gram sabhas will also take 'Jal Shapath' (oath) for water conservation, it added. The Ken Betwa link project agreement heralds the beginning of inter-state cooperation to implement the vision of former prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee to carry water from areas that have surplus water to drought prone and water deficit areas through the interlinking of rivers, the PMO said. This project involves transfer of water from Ken to Betwa River through the construction of Daudhan Dam and a canal linking the two rivers, the lower Orr project, Kotha barrage and Bina complex multipurpose project. It will provide annual irrigation of 10.62 lakh hectare, drinking water supply to about 62 lakh people and also generate 103 MW of hydropower.The PMO said the project will be of immense benefit to the water starved region of Bundelkhand, especially to the districts of Panna, Tikamgarh, Chhatarpur, Sagar, Damoh, Datia, Vidisha, Shivpuri and Raisen of Madhya Pradesh and Banda, Mahoba, Jhansi and Lalitpur of Uttar Pradesh. It will pave the way for more interlinking of river projects to ensure that scarcity of water does not become an inhibitor for development in the country, the PMO said.

Comparing the act of extortion to rape, Amruta Fadnavis said that "it injures the spirit and well-being of the innocent and the weak".Resorting to Extortion to get funds ,is like Committing Rape to get sex !Both injure the spirit & well-being of the innocent & the weak ! #MahaVasooliAghadi #MaharashtraGovernment #wakeup#Target100Cr #100Crore #100CroreKiVasuliShe used ₹100 crore as a hashtag in reference to the allegations made by former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh, who said in a letter to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray that Deshmukh - the Maharashtra home minister - gave arrested cop Sachin Vaze a target to extort ₹100 crore from various city joints.Since it surfaced on Saturday, the letter has shaken the political arena in Maharashtra. Opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) quickly launched an attack on the ruling dispensation, demanding resignation of Deshmukh. Devendra Fadnavis even said that the chief minister should sack him.Also Watch: BJP cites old report after Mumbai 'letter bomb' surfacesThe BJP also organised a series of protests in a few Maharashtra cities demanding action against Deshmukh.Sharad Pawar, the chief of MVA constituent Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), held a press conference in Delhi on Sunday where he said that there is no threat to the government due to the crisis. He also said that the allegations against Deshmukh are serious and it is the prerogative of CM Uddhav Thackeray to take appropriate action.The NCP leaders also held a meeting at Pawar's residence in Delhi after which party leader Jayant Patil ruled out Deshmukh's resignation.

"How many will have to be sacrificed to save the king?" Amruta tweeted.Deshmukh, meanwhile, has denied the allegations against him, saying Param Bir Singh wrote the letter to save himself from legal action in the Mukesh Ambani security threat case, in which Vaze was arrested by the National Investigation Agency (NIA). Deshmukh said that Singh was removed after some "serious lapses" were found in the case.He has threatened to file a defamation case against Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/resorting-to-extortion-is-like-amruta-fadnavis-lashes-out-at-mva-govt-101616344450200.html

Senior Congress leader Randeep Surjewala took to Twitter on Sunday, demanding that the Union government remove Yediyurappa as chief minister over charges of corruption.“As “Corruption Charges” against CM Yediyurappa unfold through judicial verdicts, why is BJP “mum”? Why is PM Modi ji “silent”? Where is Naddaji? Why is CM Yediyurappa not sacked? Why is media scared of even touching the story?” Surjewala posted on Twitter. He posted the link of the news which referred to the Karnataka High Court, on March 17, allowing the reinstatement of an eight-year old corruption case against the 78-year-old chief minister. Yediyurappa has been under pressure ever since he returned to power by engineering the collapse of the HD Kumaraswamy-led coalition government in Karnataka in 2019. Kumaraswamy also took to Twitter to get PM Modi’s attention on the existing corruption in Karnataka. Taking on the Prime Minister’s comments against the “single-window” system in Bengal, Kumaraswamy posted a five-part tweet which accused the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government in the state of practicing corruption. “But what kind of single window system is prevailing in Karnataka, ruled by the BJP? Will Modi reply to this? The senior BJP MLAs themselves are lamenting everywhere in Karnataka about the BJP govt’s ‘single window system’ which is hiding behind the chair of CM BS Yediyurappa,” he posted. “Modi’s act of criticizing @MamataOfficial when there is a single window system in Karnataka government itself which is intentionally being nurtured, is like cheating the conscience,” he added. He said that Modi should first end the corruption prevalent in Karnataka. Yediyurappa has often found himself fighting people within his own party demanding that he be replaced. Basangouda Ramanagouda Patil (Yatnal), one of Yediyurappa’s staunchest critics, continued his tirade against the chief minister, stating that the leader be replaced if the BJP wants a chance to return to power in 2023. “It is confirmed that the CM will be replaced,” Yatnal said on Saturday.“If we take this CM and go in for the next elections....,” he paused, implying defeat. He said that the general secretary of the party may well be aware of this fact. “If BJP must survive, then the CM must be changed,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/calls-for-cm-yediyurappa-s-removal-grow-louder-in-karnataka-and-beyond-101616344546877.html
21-03-2021||India||Mizoram CM, Myanmar foreign minister in exile hold talks on refugee influx||Amid the influx of refugees from the neighbouring country to the state following a military coup, Mizoram chief minister Zoramthanga on Sunday held an online meeting with Myanmar foreign minister in exile Zin Mar Aung. “Had a fruitful meeting (online) this morning with Zin Mar Aung, hon’ble foreign minister, Myanmar. Our thoughts and prayers are with Myanmar in these trying times,” Zoramthanga tweeted on Sunday. Zin Mar Aung was named the acting foreign affairs minister three weeks ago by a committee comprising elected lawmakers of Myanmar from the overthrown National League for Democracy (NLD). She is not the foreign affairs minister in the present military regime.Although no official statement was issued by the CM’s office on details of the meeting, it is learnt that the two leaders discussed the fallout of the military coup in Myanmar last month and the influx of refugees to Mizoram through the border. As per reports, since the military coup last month, over 500 people from Myanmar, including policemen and families, fled fearing persecution and entered Mizoram through the state’s 510-kilometre-long boundary with the neighbouring country. These refugees are staying in villages along the border. Also read: ‘No choice’ - Fleeing coup, Myanmar police refugees in India seek asylumEarlier this month, the Centre had directed Mizoram, Nagaland, Arunachal Pradesh and Manipur - four states that share a border with Myanmar - to stop illegal infiltration and deport Myanmarese nationals who enter India. On March 18, Zoramthanga had written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, saying the Centre’s directives were “not acceptable” to Mizoram. “I understand that there are certain foreign policy issues where India needs to proceed cautiously. However, we can’t ignore this humanitarian crisis,” the CM wrote. He added that the areas in Myanmar bordering Mizoram are inhabited by the Chin community with whom Mizo people have ethnic ties and have close contacts from even before India became independent. “Mizoram cannot just remain indifferent to their sufferings. India cannot turn a blind eye to this humanitarian crisis unfolding right in front of us in our own backyard,” Zoramthanga mentioned in his letter. He added that as the largest democracy and Myanmar’s immediate neighbour, India needs to do more in the matter. “I therefore strongly urge you to intervene so that the political refugees from Myanmar are given asylum and provided food and shelter here in the country,” the CM said. On Friday, a high-level team from Mizoram, including two MPs from the state, called on the Union minister of state for home Nityanand Rai in Delhi and discussed issues concerning relief measures for Myanmar refugees in the state. According to a state government release, the team pressed on the minister to extend help and support to the Myanmar refugees “who are victims of violence and brutality under military rule in Myanmar” while ruling out the possibility of deporting the refugees back till the situation in the neighbouring country returns to normal. “Members of the team requested the central government’s intervention for providing necessary relief measures to refugees staying in Mizoram and expressed hope that India will take a more proactive role and raise a stronger voice in support of people fighting for the restoration of democracy in Myanmar,” the statement read.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amid-influx-of-refugees-mizoram-cm-holds-talks-with-myanmar-foreign-minister-101616344545771.html
21-03-2021||India||Won't be fair to comment as NCP chief has spoken: Congress on graft charges against Maha home minister Anil Deshmukh||The Congress on Sunday said it would not be fair on its part to comment on the controversy that erupted after ex-Mumbai police chief Param Bir Singh accused Maharashtra Home Minister Anil Deshmukh of graft as the NCP and the chief minister are looking into it.Steering clear of making a direct comment on the matter, Congress spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi said the issue concerns Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray and the NCP as the minister in question is from that party.Attempting to deflect questions concerning Maharashtra, Singhvi raised the issue of graft charges against Karnataka Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa to accuse the BJP of hypocrisy and questioned Prime Minister Narendra Modi's silence on the mater.He asked why the prime minister and Home Minister Amit Shah have not uttered a word about the corruption allegation against Yediyurappa, even when there have been three judgments from the high court in this regard."We want Yediyurappa to resign immediately," the Congress spokesperson said.On the developments in Maharashtra, he said the Maha Vikas Aghadi government is one and NCP leader Sharad Pawar is addressing charges against Deshmukh, who belongs to that party."Sharad Pawar has commented on what is essentially concerning a minister from that part of the coalition. I think it would not be fair for me to say anything, much of what has been said by Pawar in consultation with the CM."But whatever has been left out, you would have to approach Maharashtra's Congress in-charge H K Patil," he told reporters when asked to clear his party's stand on the issue.Singhvi said Patil has been requested to deal with this and he can be approached in this regard."Primarily, this issue concerns the NCP and the chief minister. The Aghadi government is one. Pawar has spoken, Patil will speak tomorrow. Wait for some more time, as you have received silence on the issue of Yediyurappa," he said.Asked about BJP accusing the Congress of hypocrisy for not speaking on the Maharashtra issue, Singhvi said, "Has Modi made a comment on Yediyurappa, even after three briefings by me. There has been no briefing or comments from him. Has the Home Minister (Amit Shah) even bothered to talk about Yediyurappa."The Congress spokesperson said the leader of the Maha Vikas Aghadi coalition Sharad Pawar has already spoken and he will be giving a more detailed statement by tomorrow and the chief minister is already looking into it."Which of these has happened with Mr Modi qua Mr Yediyurappa? He has become a 'mauni baba' on this issue?" Singhvi posed.On the BJP's charge that Udhav Thackeray has lost the moral authority to rule, the Congress leader said, "I will agree with him after the facts come out. But till then, substitute the word Uddhav Thackeray with Yeddyurappa and just kindly put the poster back in his drawing-room. I request him to use the same sentence and put the name of Yediyurappa as there are three orders of the High Court."Singhvi alleged that Yediyurappa has the guts to go to the Supreme Court to get an interim order for not being arrested and continues to "stick" to his seat."We have not even heard a whisper from anybody in the BJP which gives us lectures on morality every day. The contrast is clear," he said."The hypocrisies and double-face is underlined in fact by the totally different conduct of the two parties," he said pointing out inaction on the part of the BJP leadership on the alleged corruption charges against Yediyurappa.Singhvi accused the Karnataka chief minister of having crossed limits of shame and alleged that he has no morality left in holding on to the post when there are three High Court orders for trying him under the Prevention of Corruption Act."We cannot allow political thick-skinnedness to take us for granted. People's indifference becomes a breeding ground for corruption and it is to shock you out of your indifference that we speak to you through the media," he said.The Congress leader claimed the fear of losing power is corrupting and alleged that Yediyurappa is hanging on to the chief minister's seat without regard to morality and political decency."Is this the moral plane on which the chief minister can sit on his seat? Is this the morality of the prime minister who never asks him to leave? Is this the principal stand of the home minister who does not remove him?"Is this the Nelsonian blind eye of the party to which he belongs which will not touch him? Is this the naked, shameless lust for power that makes people stick on and parties ignore everything? This is the worst form of breeding down of corruption. It clearly exposes the unethical, unscrupulous and untrustworthy nature of the BJP," Singhvi said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/wont-be-fair-to-comment-as-ncp-chief-has-spoken-congress-on-graft-charges-against-maha-home-minister-anil-deshmukh-101616342580089.html

21-03-2021||India||Transport ministry asks departments to tighten IT security after alert about 'targeted intrusion activities'||The Ministry of Road Transport and Highways on Sunday received an alert from the Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-In) regarding "targeted intrusion activities" directed towards the Indian transport sector with "possible malicious intentions," a senior official informed HT."The Ministry of Road Transport and Highways received an alert from CERT-In regarding targeted intrusion activities directed towards the Indian transport sector with possible malicious intentions. The ministry has advised departments and organisations under the transport sector to strengthen the security posture of their infrastructure," the ministry stated."The ministry is issuing an advisory to all departments and organisations under the transport sector to strengthen cybersecurity. Accordingly, NIC, NHAI, NHIDCL, IRC, IAHE, state PWDs, testing agencies and automobile manufacturers have been requested to conduct the security audit of the entire IT system by CERT-In certified agencies immediately and regularly. The audit report and the ATR will be regularly submitted to the government," the officials said.This comes in the backdrop of a slew of cybersecurity attacks on the Indian government domains over the past few months. HT had previously reported about new phishing emails that used compromised government accounts and targeted groups of officials, attempting to lure them into sharing their passwords on a page that mirrored the government’s official mail server sign-on website - an attack that could have let the attackers gain access to sensitive credentials and files.The attack prompted the government’s IT departments to send out an alert the following day to large groups of officials, according to emails seen by HT. The incident was the latest in a series of such cyberattacks that leverage compromised @gov.in or @nic.in email addresses issued by the National Informatics Centre (NIC), which may be more successful in luring the targets into sharing sensitive information.On February 21, HT also reported that the devices of multiple former defence personnel may have been compromised in a phishing attack launched through similar attacks carried out by government-domain email addresses.Altogether, HT is aware of five NIC domain addresses – four with @gov.in suffixes and the fifth an @nic.in one – that have been used to launch cyberattacks.Earlier this month, an American cyber intelligence company called Recorded Future also said it had uncovered a suspected China-linked cyber operation that was focussed on India’s electricity grid and other critical infrastructure. While the company did not link the Mumbai incident to the operation (which it titled RedEcho) it discovered, it did not rule out a link. According to Recorded Future, RedEcho deployed malware known as ShadowPad which has been previously linked to Chinese cyber soldiers. ShadowPad has the ability to hand over systems controls to malicious hackers who can then make potentially catastrophic changes to sensitive industrial systems.Chinese-government linked attackers possibly gained access to computer networks part of India’s power infrastructure, a US-based cybersecurity firm has said, citing technical clues that federal power ministry officials separately said they had been on their radar, fuelling speculation that a blackout in Mumbai last year may have been the result of sabotage.Hours after the disclosure, the Union power ministry said it had received inputs from Indian agencies — first in November and then again in February this year — about the threat of infection from ShadowPad, prompting remedial measures to be taken.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/transport-ministry-receives-alert-about-cyberattack-all-departments-told-to-strengthen-security-infrastructure-101616341256885.html

This will be in our priorities but yes keeping in mind the situation and the expectations of the Centre after making it a UT,” Paswan told the media on the sidelines of an award function in Srinagar.Paswan, who has been lying low after his party was decimated in the Bihar assembly election last year, also said that he felt a chasm between people of Kashmir and Delhi which needs to be filled.“Along with the development, there is a need for hand holding. The people of Jammu and Kashmir, particularly of the Valley, need to be reassured. I feel a sort of chasm between people of Kashmir and those of Delhi. That needs to be filled,” he said.Paswan along with two other parliamentarians from LJP party Prince Raj and Veena Devi were here on a two day visit which concluded on Sunday. The LJP is a member of National Democratic Alliance(NDA) led by the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party.Paswan was the chief guest at an awards function at Sheri Kashmir International Convention Centre to honor the ‘real heroes’ of Kashmir on Sunday. The delegation met some public delegations on Saturday.The LJP chief said that their intention was to meet the people and see how things have changed after the revocation of Article 370. He said that it was with a good intention that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah took the step of revoking Article 370.“We have come here for two reasons, one to strengthen the party and also see how things have improved after revocation of Article 370 or where things need to improve further. While many people are satisfied, others are expecting the centre to change much more things,” he said.He said that after returning to Delhi his party would inform the PM about the expectations of people in Kashmir.“I will request the PM for works to develop infrastructure here as well as attempts to join the people here with mainstream. We need to think over these issues more seriously,” he said.“After returning from here I would like to see more and more young parliamentarians who become a voice of Kashmiris, who raise genuine issues of Kashmiris not just show a rosy picture,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ljp-boss-chirag-paswan-backs-restoration-of-statehood-for-jammu-and-kashmir-101616338007178.html

21-03-2021||India||10-20 Kumbh pilgrims testing Covid-19 positive daily: Centre||Noting that there is a potential of an upsurge in Covid-19 cases during the Kumbh Mela, the Centre has written to Uttarakhand strongly highlighting the concerns raised by a high-level central team about the need for stringent measures to control the spread of the disease.The central team led by the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) Director visited Uttarakhand on March 16-17 to review the medical and public health measures undertaken by the state for the ongoing Kumbh Mela in Haridwar, the Health Ministry said in a statement.In his letter to the Uttarakhand Chief Secretary, Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan has observed that more than 12 states in India have shown a surge in Covid-19 cases during the past few weeks, and pilgrims expected to visit Haridwar during the Kumbh Mela could also be from these states."It has been noted that there is a potential of an upsurge in cases in the local population after the auspicious Shahi Snan days during the Kumbh Mela," the ministry said."The secretary also noted that as per the report of the central team, 10-20 pilgrims and 10-20 locals are being reported positive every day."This positivity rate has the potential to rapidly turning to an upsurge in cases, given the expected large footfall during Kumbh," the ministry said in its statement.The state has been informed that the daily testing numbers reported in Haridwar -- 50,000 Rapid Antigen tests and 5,000 RTPCR tests -- are not enough to effectively offset a huge number of expected pilgrim footfall.It has been advised that the share of RTPCR tests being conducted at present needs to be significantly increased as per the ICMR guidelines to ensure that the pilgrims and local population is appropriately tested.The state government has been advised to follow scrupulously the SOPs issued by the ministry and display signage to disseminate the main points of these SOPs; increase awareness of self-reporting, especially among local population, in case of symptoms suggestive of Covid-19; and set up system for generating early warning signals in areas with susceptible population by monitoring trend of ARI/ ILI cases through Emergency Operational Centres.It has also been urged to target significantly enhanced testing in potential high transmission areas, continue periodic testing of frontline workers before and after auspicious bathing days of the Kumbh and ensure operationalisation of adequate critical care treatment facilities.It has also been asked to ensure effective risk communication, by using all forms of media platforms, for strict adherence to Covid-appropriate behaviour."In case of surge in cases/super spreader events, promptly send samples for genome sequencing in consultation with NCDC," the ministry said.The Union Health Secretary has urged the Uttarakhand government to take a stock of the public health measures being undertaken by the state in consonance with the aforesaid recommendations of the Health Ministry, the statement added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/1020-kumbh-pilgrims-testing-covid-19-positive-daily-centre-101616336282049.html
21-03-2021||India||Assam assembly election: Congress desperate, might resort to politics to divide society, says Jitendra Singh||The Congress, which faces an imminent defeat in the Assam polls, has become desperate and might resort to politics to divide the society in the state but the BJP will never allow this, Union Minister Jitendra Singh said on Sunday.Referring to the grand alliance of opposition parties, including Congress, Left parties and AIUDF, formed for the three-phase state elections, he said the Congress' leadership has thoroughly exposed itself by turning away from its ideological position by seeking the "support offered by an overtly communal outfit headed by Badruddin Ajmal".The Ajmal headed All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF) is considered to have a large base among Assam's about 35 per cent Muslim population."The BJP is a party with a consistent ideology of justice to all sections of society without appeasement. The Congress may have become desperate enough to resort to politics of dividing the society in Assam, but we shall never allow this to happen," Singh, the minister of state in the Prime Minister's Office, told PTI.In the last seven years, because of the constant outreach of Prime Minister Narendra Narendra Modi and diligent efforts of Home Minister Amit Shah, "we have succeeded in restoring peace and harmony, and we shall not allow the Congress to undo this just for vote bank politics", said Singh, who is also the BJP's co-incharge for Assam.Polling will be held in 47 seats in Assam on March 27 in the first phase, while 39 and 40 constituencies will go to polls on April 1 and April 6 respectively.Addressing a poll rally at the Mangaldoi area late on Saturday night, Singh had accused the Congress of seeking alliances out of desperation as it faces imminent defeat in the elections."Suddenly the Congress has decided to seek the support offered by an overtly communal outfit headed by Badruddin Ajmal," the minister said.He claimed that it was the same Badruddin, whom till 2016, Congress' senior leader and the then Assam chief minister late Tarun Gogoi had vehemently opposed being associated with in spite of suggestions from certain quarters."So much so, when a media person once asked Gogoi about any possibility of an alliance with Badruddin Ajmal, Gogoi had retorted back angrily saying 'Who is Badruddin?', but unfortunately, today the same Badruddin has become the face and identity of the Congress in Assam,” Singh said.The grand alliance comprising Congress, AIUDF, Bodoland People's Front (BPF), CPI, CPI(M), CPI(ML), Anchalik Gana Morcha (AGM) and the RJD has been formed in Assam to contest the election to the 126-member assembly against the BJP-led NDA.BJP national general secretary and MP from Mangaldoi, Dilip Saikia, while addressing the rally, said it is remarkable how Jitendra Singh, who belonged to Jammu and Kashmir, had made the North East his second home and earned the respect and love of the local people.Singh, a Lok Sabha member from Jammu and Kashmir's Udhampur, is also the minister of state for the Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER).He said, BJP will never allow Badruddin to play the politics of hatred and separatism as was done by some leaders in Kashmir and elsewhere.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-assembly-election-congress-desperate-might-resort-to-politics-to-divide-society-says-jitendra-singh-101616335654245.html

The media should at least extend one percent of the support to the opposition that it has been giving to the ruling front," Chennithala said at a press meet here.He also said, "the media has forgotten the journalistic ethics by rejecting space for the Opposition.""Certain anchors are already congratulating and claiming that Vijayan will win another term.... the state government has given ₹200 crore-worth advertisements to whitewash the government drowning in corruption," he added.The Congress tweeted thatit was 'deplorable' to see the extravaganza of advertisement spend by LDF, even in other regional newspapers."The source of funds & the spending is concerning for the people of Kerala," the party said in the tweet.Noting that the media was the fourth pillar of democracy, the leader of opposition in the state assembly said, "Media in Kerala are failing in its duty by turning into mouth pieces of CPI(M)."Taking on the Left dispensation on the Sabarimala issue, he said neither the government nor the ruling party have changed their stance on the matter."The stance of the government and the CPI(M) on Sabarimala has not been changed. It's very dangerous.The CM is hoodwinking the people by saying that the matter will be discussed after the final verdict of the Supreme Court," Chennithala said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/media-in-kerala-becoming-mouthpiece-of-cpi-m-says-congress-leader-ramesh-chennithala-101616330714900.html
21-03-2021||India||To encourage reading, Odisha sets up its first public library in a park||In a novel initiative to inculcate the reading habit in students, youngsters and the community at large, the Bhubaneswar Development Authority on Sunday opened a public library in one of the parks of Bhubaneswar where children can come and read books for 6 hours every day.The library, a collaboration between the BDA and city-based Bakul Foundation, started functioning at the Biju Patnaik Park, popularly known as ‘Forest Park’, and will have around 2000 books, including fiction, non-fiction, biographies, classics and textbooks. Though this library caters to people of all age groups, it would focus on children and students. It would have among others all-time favourite series-- Wimpy Kids, Geronimo Stilton books, Hardy Boys, Nancy Drew books, Enid Blyton books and the Harry Potter series.Former IAS officer and chief advisor to CM Naveen Patnaik, R. Balakrishnan who inaugurated the library on Sunday morning, said it is a great step by the BDA to promote the park library culture at a time when the reading habit is declining among youngsters.“In the age of Internet and social media, there is a steady decline in the reading habit. Therefore, initiatives like a park library will surely help in encouraging and promoting reading habits among all. This library will definitely attract children, students, book lovers and people visiting the park who can spend some time in reading amid a cool and peaceful environment,” said Balakrishnan, adding that more such libraries will come up in other big parks in the city.The BDA has provided the space and the physical infrastructure required for setting up the library. As the library is located within the park, it would be open between 7 am and 10 am then between 4 pm and 7 pm daily except on Mondays.Founder-secretary of Bakul Foundation, Sujit Mahapatra said the library has a collection of Odia and English books and has shelves with books for children too, with chairs and tables meant for them. “The books have been graded into difficulty levels and genres to get a child interested in reading without intimidating him or her. The library has books in English and Odia, but there is a shelf each for children’s books in Hindi and French as well.The foundation will engage its volunteers – comprising students, retired people, homemakers and professionals – who will conduct storytelling sessions, creative workshops and live performances to attract students and youngsters to the library,” Mahapatra said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/to-encourage-reading-odisha-sets-up-its-first-public-library-in-a-park-101616333385061.html
21-03-2021||India||Covid-19: BJP workers not infected as they work hard, says Gujarat MLA||A Gujarat BJP MLA on Sunday said workers of his party do not get infected with novel coronavirus since they work hard.Rajkot (South) legislator Govind Patel's take on coronavirus came after reporters asked him if the flouting of guidelines by political leaders and workers during poll campaigning was resulting in a spike in cases."Those who work hard do not get coronavirus infection. BJP workers work hard, and therefore, not a single worker has been infected with the virus," Patel claimed.Incidentally, during the campaigning for the local bodies polls last month, Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani was detected with the infection, and among others in the ruling party who have tested positive at different points of time include state unit chief CR Paatil and several MLAs.On Saturday, Vadodara BJP MP Ranjanben Bhatt had announced that she was admitted in hospital for Covid-19.Meanwhile, state Deputy Chief Minister Nitin Patel refuted talk that local polls as well as the Test and T20I cricket matches in Ahmedabad were prime factors behind the Covid-19 spike."Elections are held as per the requirement under the Constitution. Cricket matches were limited to only Ahmedabad. There was no cricket match or election in Maharashtra, but it accounts for the highest number of cases, nearly 50 percent of the country's daily cases," he said.He said one could come to any conclusion on the recent surge but the reality remained that it was the people's collective responsibility to adhere to outbreak norms and control the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-bjp-workers-not-infected-as-they-work-hard-says-gujarat-mla-101616332240041.html

Who got smartphones just raise your hands? Captain Sahib had said farmers' loan will be waived. Whose loan has been waived just raise your hands,” said Kejriwal.The Delhi CM said the Congress had also promised jobs to the youth ahead of the 2017 Assembly polls.“Not even a single promise has been fulfilled,” he alleged, adding that Amamrinder Singh have “deceived” people.“Neither anyone was given job nor anyone's loan was waived,” he claimed. “I want to ask you if somebody deceives you, then what do you do?

The MVA is made up of three parties - Shiv Sena, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and Congress.Also Read: Ex-Mumbai police chief accuses minister of extortion, throws govt into crisisNCP chief Sharad Pawar said on Sunday that allegations against Deshmukh are serious and that it is the prerogative of chief minister Uddhav Thackeray to remove him. Pawar also said that he will hold meetings with his party leaders on Monday and speak to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray over the issue.Pawar also said that Singh made the allegations after his transfer on March 17 to the Home Guards. He added that the development will have no impact on the MVA government.The Shiv Sena, on its part, said that Singh's allegations have maligned the image of MVA government.Speaking to reporters in Nashik on Sunday, Sena leader Sajay Raut said that such allegations on the minister of a state cabinet are shocking for someone like him who is the well-wisher of the government."The government does not make decisions based on what the opposition says or demands. But I have to accept that in the last few hours, whatever allegations have come to light through a letter has maligned the image of the government.""Now we all have to sit and think about how we can clean the image of the government. But as I said earlier, all the constituents of the alliance in the state have to see if their feet are on the ground," Raut said.The Congress too has warned that the issue will cast a shadow on the MVA government. Party leader Sanjay Nirupam said the party must take a stand on the issue.Opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Raj Thackeray's Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) have demanded Deshmukh's resignation. In fact, the BJ{ has been pressurising the state government by holding demonstrations at multiple locations.Former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh on Saturday wrote a letter to Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray alleging that Deshmukh had indulged in "malpractices" and asked suspended cop Sachin Vaze to collect ₹100 crore every month from city's joints.Singh said in the eight-page letter that he has been "made a scapegoat to divert attention from the actual wrongdoers".Singh was shunted out as Mumbai police commissioner in the midst of investigation by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) into recovery of an explosives-laden vehicle which was found parked outside the south Mumbai residence of industrialist Mukesh Ambani last month.

21-03-2021||India||PM sad for tweet by 22-yr-old woman, but not for flood-hit people in Assam: Priyanka Gandhi||Launching a frontal attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Sunday alleged he is sad about a tweet by a "22-year-old woman" but not for the flood-ravaged people of Assam.A day after Modi raised the toolkit issue and alleged Congress conspiracy in it at a poll rally in Chabua in Assam, the daughter of late Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, lamented that Modi was silent about people's suffering in perennial flood and "attack on culture" by the Citizenship (Amendment) Act.Last year's flooding of the Brahmaputra and its tributaries during the pandemic affected some 2.8 million people in Assam."I was listening to the Prime Minister's speech yesterday. He very seriously said that he was very sad about a development. I thought he would speak about Assam's development or how BJP worked in Assam."But I was shocked to hear that the PM was talking about a tweet by a 22-year-old woman. He said the Congress conspired to finish the tea industry of Assam. He was also sad about the Congress mistakenly putting two wrong pictures on social media," Vadra said.By "a 22-year-old woman", she apparently referred to climate activist Disha Ravi, who was arrested for allegedly being involved in sharing a "toolkit" on social media related to the farmers' protest. Ravi is now out on bail.The Congress general secretary questioned Modi why he was not sad for the people affected by the flood and the anti-CAA movement, in which five youths were killed."Why didn't you come to Assam when people were drowning? Why were you not sad when all the big promises by BJP were not fulfilled? Did you go to tea gardens and talk to workers about their problems?" she asked of Modi.Vadra on March 2 visited a tea garden in Biswanath of Assam to interact with the workers and also tried her hands in plucking tea leaves, which was termed as "theatrics and drama" by the BJP leadership.Talking about her visit to a tea garden during her last trip to Assam, Gandhi said she came to know about their lifestyle and realised that "the tea garden sisters are the protectors of culture and identity".On the prime minister's frequently uttered statement of "double-engined" government in Assam, Vadra made fun of it saying the state currently has "two chief ministers", in an apparent reference to rumours of powerful minister Himanta Biswa Sarma and Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal acting as rival power centres."The PM said you have a double-engine government but Assam has two CMs. I don't know which fuel runs which engine. The Assam government is not run in Assam. Even the Asom Gana Parishad (an ally of the ruling BJP) is now Delhi Gana Parishad as it can't work without Delhi's permission... God save you!"The Assam government is currently run by remote control. If you elect them again, you will be hurt. So, elect a Congress government and have your own chief minister," she added.The Congress leader also alleged that all segments of the society, including youths, farmers and tea garden workers, have been cheated by the BJP government as it did not fulfil any of its promises made five years ago."Today, I think I will not speak about big issues, but the small problems of my sisters. You carry the biggest responsibility of the society. You run the home, bring up the children and also earn for the household."It is your life's problems and realities. I don't know them. My leaders don't know them. You are my sister. So, please take a decision carefully for your future," she appealed to the crowd, consisting mostly of women.Vadra pointed out the BJP's promises of 2016 such as 25 lakh jobs, protection of culture, implementation of Assam Accord and minimum wages to tea gardens, and alleged that none of these have been fulfilled.Continuing her tirade against Modi, she said, "The PM also said Congress insulted Assamese culture and people won't forgive us. Now, is it not an insult to former CM Tarun Gogoi, who is no more today? Gogoi lived for Assam and worked for people till his last breath."She also slammed Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath for allegedly insulting 15th-16th century Vaishnavite scholar Srimanta Sankardeva by stating that he fought against infiltrators.Vadra alleged the BJP's sole aim is to "hand over" prime properties of Assam to Modi's 2-3 close businessmen friends."The BJP wanted to hand over farmers' land in Nagaon to a corporate body. When protests took place, a pregnant woman was attacked and farmers were jailed. They also brought an ordinance to sell land to anyone from outside without any permission," she said.Assam has huge unemployment problem, while several big scams have surfaced in the last five years, she alleged."How can you trust the BJP? You have seen what you have got in five years. Tarun Gogoi might have committed some mistakes, but he never cheated you. He did not bring the CAA and attacked your culture and identity," she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-sad-for-tweet-by-22-yr-old-woman-but-not-for-flood-hit-people-in-assam-priyanka-gandhi-101616328838156.html

They should be ready for any unforeseen thing like this (coronavirus) which the future may throw up,” he said.Vardhan said the Bio Innovation Centre will help the start-ups as well as MSMEs.“The Narendra Modi government stands rock solid behind anyone who has got a bright idea and wants to convert that idea into an entrepreneurship, discover or develop something new, which can help solve some of the long-standing unresolved problems of the countrymen and maybe alleviate their sufferings and make their lives better. That is what the idea of this ‘Start-up and Stand up’ movement is,” he said.He said a special fund worth almost over ₹900 crore was established to help the industry expedite research for Covid-19 vaccine.Vardhan also inaugurated Centre of Excellence for Intelligent Sensors and System at the Central Scientific Instruments Organisation here, as well as a vaccination help desk at Dadu Majra colony here, an event organised by the city unit of the BJP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/health-minister-says-6-crore-covid-19-vaccine-doses-sent-to-76-nations-4-5-crore-doses-administered-in-india-101616327468025.html

The farmers were obstructed, but they reached the borders of Delhi. All the farmers of the nation today stand united. Punjab is the land of the brave. The farmers of Punjab have taken leadership in the protest," Kejriwal said while addressing a rally at the Maha Kisan Panchayat in Moga.Kejriwal said that his party will always stand shoulder to shoulder with the farmers protesting against the Centre's three farm laws. "Few days back, I spoke with Mamata Banerjee. She said the farmers of Bengal support the revolution. This revolution belongs to all," he added.Kejriwal also hit out at the Amarinder Singh-led Punjab government, accusing it of not keeping its poll promises and deceiving people. He said four years ago, Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh had made “big promises”.“Captain Sahib had said smartphones will be given. Who got smartphones just raise your hands? Captain Sahib had said farmers' loan will be waived. Whose loan has been waived just raise your hands,” said Kejriwal.The Delhi chief minister said the Congress had also promised jobs to the youth ahead of the 2017 Assembly polls.“Not even a single promise has been fulfilled,” he alleged, adding that Amarinder Singh have “deceived” people.“Neither anyone was given job nor anyone's loan was waived,” he claimed. “I want to ask you if somebody deceives you, then what do you do? Usse se badla lete hain (Revenge is taken from him). Captain Sahib has deceived you. Whether revenge will be taken after one year or not,” he asked.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-causing-hindrance-to-farmers-movement-claims-kejriwal-in-punjab-101616326579879.html

21-03-2021||India||How Covid-19 cases spiked in India between Feb, March: Weekly comparision||India has been witnessing a steep rise in its daily caseload of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases in the past few weeks. A comparison of the government data from a week each of February and March shows that India's infection tally has swelled by nearly three times.According to the data released by the Union health ministry, India saw 86,711 total cases of Covid-19 in the third week of February (15-21). In the same period in March, the country recorded close to 2.5 lakh (240,082 to be exact) new cases of the infection. The recent rise in cases is surpassing the surge India saw in December when the country had just come out of a festive month and public celebrations.In the last seven days, India has recorded more than 24,000 new Covid-19 cases every day, with the highest daily spike seen on Sunday when 43,846 infections were registered.The gradual increase in the daily caseload in the third week of February did send the alarm bells ringing for authorities, particularly in states like Maharashtra and Kerala, after which the Centre advised them to increase the proportion of RT-PCR tests and regularly monitor mutant strains besides refocusing on strict surveillance and stringent containment in selected districts.To stop the sharp spike from burdening India's healthcare system, Prime Minister Narendra Modi met the chief ministers on Wednesday this week and handed out a five-point plan to fight the deadly infection.Reiterating his famous slogan 'Dawai bhi, kadai bhi' (yes to medicine, yes to caution), PM Modi told the CMs that states will have to step up testing and focus on maximising vaccination. In his five-point plan, the first is Covid-19 appropriate behaviour. In addition to that, the states will have to scale up RT-PCR tests, create micro-containment zones, increase vaccination in both private and government hospitals and stop vaccine wastage.About 70 districts of the country have seen an increase of more than 150 per cent in the number of Covid-19 cases in the last few weeks, PM Modi said, adding that if the spread can’t be contained now, a situation of a nationwide outbreak can come up. But at the same time, he emphasised not to create panic among people.Case count in week 3 of February and March (as published by Press Information Bureau):||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/how-covid-19-cases-spiked-in-india-between-feb-march-weekly-comparision-101616292773120.html
21-03-2021||India||Generational change in Kerala Congress’ candidates list has Rahul Gandhi’s touch||At the break of dawn, Aritha Babu gets busy feeding and milking at her cattle barn, after which, she sets out to supply milk riding her two-wheeler. She doesn’t forget to remind customers about her candidature in the upcoming assembly elections while asking them to also rally their relatives behind her. The 27-year-old girl next door, who hails from a small-time farming family, is the Congress candidate from Kayamkulam assembly constituency in Alappuzha district. Congress has fielded many candidates like Babu in Kerala this time and she thinks it is reflective of the “generational shift” in the party. “Initially I could not believe when my name was announced. It took some time to sync in. It is a big recognition for the work I did for my party in the last 14 years,” she said. Inspired by her father, an ordinary party worker, Babu entered politics at a young age of 13 with the Kerala Students Union and later joined Youth Congress. She was elected to Alappuzha district panchayat in 2015 at the age of 22. A graduate in commerce, she is pursuing her masters in social work. She is up against the sitting MLA Pratiba Hari of the CPI (M) and NDA’s Pradeep Lal. Pratiba Hari had defeated Congress candidate N Liju by over 11,000 votes at Kayamkulam in the last polls. “It is really good as many youngsters have been given seats this time. I think this is the first time the party has fielded so many fresh faces and it really shows the generational shift in the party. I really thank party leader Rahul Gandhi for this,” she said, adding she won’t indulge in mud- slinging or personal attacks in the political fight. At least 70 km south of Kayamkulam, in Varkala in Kollam district, also a famous beach destination, another youngster is seeking votes on Congress ticket. 32-year-old BRM Shafeer is also known as the “one –rupee lawyer”. Hailing from a poor family, he was a rubber tapper for many years while pursuing his studies. After enrolling as a lawyer in Nedumangad court, he has spent a lot of time fighting cases of the poor for free, which has earned him the moniker. “Many leaders including the late veteran, K Karunakaran, helped me during my college days. At one point even three meals were a luxury to me. But many leaders groomed and helped me. I dedicate my seat to them,” he said. Sitting legislator V Joy is his main opponent here. The BJP-led NDA has fielded SRM Aji from Verkala. A close look at the candidates’ list of all three formations in the state (UDF, LDF and NDA) shows a decent input of fresh blood. “Our leader Rahul Gandhi was keen on young faces and at least 55% of our candidates are fresh ones,” said opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala, adding that Babu and Shafeer were classic examples of this approach. Not to be left behind, the ruling CPI(M) has also fielded many young candidates. At least four front candidates are under 30 and the secretary of the party-backed Students’ Federation of India (SFI) Sachin Dev (28) is the youngest of them. Dev is contesting from Balussery in north Kerala’s Kozhikode district, where the Congress has fielded the popular comedian of Malayalam cinema, Dharmajan. “For the CPI(M), it is routine to give chance to young blood unlike some Congress leaders, who are holding on to their seats for more than 30 to 40 years,” said Dev. He cited the elevation of 22-year old Arya Rajendran as the Mayor of the Thiruvananthapuram Corporation to burnish his party’s credentials on this front. Though the BJP candidates are among the oldest in these elections, including 88-year-old Metro Man E Sreedharan, the party has fielded many youngsters, including party spokesman Sandip Warrier (31) and Asha nath (28). “Our leader PM Modi always gives a big push to youngsters,” said Asha Nath, seeking election from Chirayinkeehzu in Thiruvananthapuram district. She is also a councillor of Thiruvananthapuram Corporation. “It is true that there is a whiff of fresh air in some parties including the grand old party. It is really good. I hope it will result in qualitative changes in state politics,” said political observer and thinker Prof M N Karassery.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/generational-change-in-kerala-congress-candidates-list-has-rahul-gandhi-s-touch-101616324024426.html

"We are at the beginning of the second wave of coronavirus. Let us all join hands to control it because the next three months are crucial for us," Sudhakar told reporters here as the coronavirus cases started shooting up. He said he would discuss with Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa about the Covid-19 situation and measures to be taken. He said the state Technical Advisory Committee on coronavirus has given clear guidelines to the government stating that people would be in for a trouble if certain activities were not controlled. "We all will be responsible for the aftermath if the government and people do not respond to experts' report," Sudhakar said. To a question whether election-related activities would be among those needed to be under check, Sudhakar sought to know, "Can any activity be an excuse for coronavirus? Will it spare VIPs, political parties or religious congregations?" The Minister underlined the need for an all-party meeting in view of the coronavirus situation since the byelections were round the corner and all the political parties would take part in it. Sudhakar's warning came as the cases in Karnataka shot upto 1,798 with seven deaths and Bengaluru urban district alone contributed 1,186 cases, including five deaths, on Saturday.

21-03-2021||India||'Maharashtra Vasooli Aghadi': BJP leader's jibe over Param Bir Singh's claims||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) continued its attack on the ruling three-party coalition in Maharashtra, saying it should be renamed ‘Maharashtra Vasooli Aghadi’. The comment was made by BJP leader CT Ravi in the wake of extortion allegations made by former Mumbai top cop Param Bir Singh against Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh."I think Maharashtra is governed by ‘Maharashtra Vasooli Aghadi’. We demand CBI inquiry and his removal from the cabinet," Ravi said on Sunday, according to news agency ANI.Singh wrote a letter to Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, who is heading the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government of Shiv Sena, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and Congress, claiming that Deshmukh asked Sachin Vaze - the cop arrested in connection with Mukesh Ambani bomb scare case - to extort ₹100 crore a month from Mumbai’s bars and restaurants. Deshmukh, a leader of the NCP, has denied Singh's allegations.The 'letter bomb' has the potential to cast serious strains in the Maharashtra government, causing NCP chief Sharad Pawar to rush to resolve the crisis. Though Pawar said that allegations against Deshmukh are serious and it is the prerogative of the chief minister to take appropriate action, he rubbished claims that there is threat to the ruling alliance.The BJP has stepped up its attack on the Thackeray government, demanding resignation of Deshmukh. Former Maharashtra chief minister and leader of the opppsition Devendra Fadnavis said on Sunday that the home minister must be sacked. He also questioned the silence of Thackeray and deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar.The BJP also staged demonstrations against Deshmukh in Mumbai.The allegations were made by Singh a day after Deshmukh said that the police officer was moved out as Mumbai police commissioner so that cases pertaining to Vaze were probed without obstruction. In the letter, Param Bir Singh, who has now been posted as Commandant General of Home Guards, said that he has been "made a scapegoat to divert attention from the actual wrongdoers".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-vasooli-aghadi-bjp-leader-s-jibe-over-param-bir-singh-s-claims-101616320378835.html

The BJP-led National Democratic Front’s (NDF) manifesto, to be released on March 24, was also expected to announce many sops for women, said political observers.While the LDF manifesto put emphasis on three Ws, (women, welfare and workforce) the UDF tried to address specific needs of women voters, who outnumber men by 8 .27 lakh in the electoral roll of the state. The UDF has promised a hike in the qualifying age of women for government competitive examinations to 37 years and promised to give mothers with small children, another two-year extension. Similarly, it proposed a ministry of happiness to ensure better domestic life and deal with post-Covid blues.The LDF said the free food kits distribution will continue. It was started on a pilot basis during the height of the pandemic in March-April 2000 and was extended till May this year. A big hit among economically weaker sections, free food kits played a key role in the decisive victory of the LDF in the local body elections in December. Distributed twice a month, the kit includes basic groceries worth ₹500-600. To counter kit diplomacy, the UDF has showcased Congress leader Rahul Gandhi’s pet minimum income guarantee scheme.“Eying women votes, parties are competing to announce sops for them, but when it comes to proper representation to women in the candidates’ lists, all sulk,” said women activist K Ajitha.Last week the state witnessed an unusual event at the Congress headquarters in the state capital. Upset with denial of a ticket to fight elections, Mahila Congress state president Lathika Subhash tonsured her head in public. In tears, she accused the party of ignoring women candidates and later announced her candidature from Ettumanoor constituency in Kottayam, as an independent.A close look at the candidate lists of all parties (LDF, UDF and NDA) shows only 38 women figure among the 420 candidates fielded by the three main fronts on 140 seats. It is roughly 9% representation.Kerala goes to polls on April 6 and the results will be declared on May 2.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-poll-bound-kerala-women-enjoy-an-edge-parties-in-race-to-keep-them-happy-101616318143903.html

He also stated that the two countries are promoting peace and stability in the region and providing for a free and open Indo-Pacific region.Stating that there was a lot of opportunities to strengthen the partnership between the two nations. "We consider India to be a great partner and again I think we have done a number of things to work well together. There's just a lot of opportunity there to strengthen that partnership and to do some things, additional things to make sure that we're promoting peace and stability in the region and providing for a free and open Indo-Pacific region, as well," he said at a press conference in New Delhi."We covered a wide range of topics that included equipment. It also included information sharing; it included additional opportunities for assisting each other logistically and just a number of things. And those were really, really good conversations," added Austin.Regarding India and US cooperation to counter Chinese aggression, Austin said, "I think -- I think that continuing to work with like-minded countries as we are working with India, we are working with Australia, Japan and others in the region to ensure that we maintain a freedom of navigation that we do -- we're doing the right things to promote peace and stability in the region and that we really work together to ensure a free and open Indo-Pacific region."While answering about sanction on Indian agreement with Russia to purchase S-400 Missile Defence System, US Secretary of Defense stated, "There has -- there has been no delivery of an S-400 system. And so that conversation -- the issues of sanctions is not one that's been discussed."Talking on engagement with a multilateral group like Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad) and Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), Austin shared, "Yes, I, clearly from a defense perspective, we do have a number of things in common, and if you just look at the countries overall, if you look at Australia, India, Japan, us, you know we really are interested in maintaining a free and open Indo-Pacific region. We're interested in being able to navigate the seas and fly the skies and international space and maintain that degree of flexibility. ""Now if you look at the fact that India and us are the largest democracies in the world. There's clearly some shared values there that we'll continue work together to -- we can build upon that and we are building upon it in economic interest. So there are a number of things that we can and will work on going forward, he added.While answering over the expansion of Quad to include countries like South Korea and Australia becoming a permanent member of the Malabar exercise, he said, "I -- from our perspective we're always willing to work with countries who share our values and have like goals and aspirations. And so whether or not those countries will choose to align with the United States and others is up to them."He also discussed mutual agreements in terms of increasing interoperability, more exercises, frequent exchanges in the Indo-Pacific in order to build great capacity, greater capability.Indo-Pacific region is largely viewed as an area comprising the Indian Ocean and the western and central Pacific Ocean, including the South China Sea. China's territorial claims in the South China Sea and its efforts to advance into the Indian Ocean are seen to have challenged the established rules-based system.Austin, who arrived in Delhi earlier on Friday, is on a three-day official visit to the country.

21-03-2021||India||Rahul Gandhi says government wants to 'snatch' farmers' future via farm laws||Stepping up his attack on the BJP-led Centre over the three new farms laws, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Sunday said the government wants to snatch the income and future of farmers for the benefit of a few top businessmen in the country.He was addressing a function in Chhattisgarh capital Raipur to disburse cash benefit to farmers and cattle-rearers under the two schemes of the state government through a recorded video-message in Hindi."What we had promised to farmers, we have fulfilled it today. You know the government of India is heading on some other path. It has brought three farm laws against the farmers. The central government wanted to snatch the income and future of farmers and hand it over to two-three big businessmen," he said without naming anyone.Hailing the Bhupesh Baghel-led dispensation in Chhattisgarh, Gandhi said he is happy that his party's governments in Chhattisgarh and other states are walking on the path of supporting farmers, labourers, small businessmen, youth and women.Targeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi over demonetisation and GST rollout, Gandhi said, "Narendra Modiji's government implemented 'notebandi' and GST, and today you can see that India has failed to create employment."In contrast, the Chhattisgarh government extended support to farmers and strengthened the rural economy, he said."We pumped in money into the rural economy and therefore, Chhattisgarh has not been facing any trouble (during the coronavirus crises), which is being faced by other states," he added.On the occasion, Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel transferred ₹1,104.27 crore into the accounts of 18.43 lakh farmers as the fourth and last instalment of Rajiv Gandhi Kisan Nyay Yojana (for kharif and rabi crop year 2019-20).Besides, he also transferred ₹7.55 crore to the accounts of cattle-rearers under the Godhan Nyay Yojana.Under the Rajiv Gandhi Kisan Nyay Yojana, farmers have been paid a total of ₹5,627.89 crore in four instalments as input support to paddy cultivators and certified seeds growers, a government official said.Under Godhan Nyay Yojna, the state government has been procuring cow dung at ₹2 per kg from cattle-rearers for production of vermi-compost, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rahul-gandhi-says-government-wants-to-snatch-farmers-future-via-farm-laws-101616315692027.html

Our investigation is on,” said North superintendent of police, Bhanupada Chakraborty, on Sunday.According to BSF, the patrolling team saw at least 12-15 cattle smugglers from the Indian side and 10-12 smugglers from Bangladesh approaching the border. As they tried to intercept them, the suspected smugglers from both the sides started pelting stones at the soldiers. Some smugglers from Indian side surrounded a BSF jawan and attacked him with a sharp weapon. The jawan, who had a narrow escape, fired two rounds from his non-lethal pump action gun in self-defence that hit one Bangladeshi smuggler.Earlier in February this year, a 22 year old youth, suspected to be a cattle smuggler, died after he was hit by a bullet fired by the BSF.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/suspected-bangladeshi-cattle-smuggler-killed-by-bsf-case-lodged-101616316343851.html

21-03-2021||India||Allegations against Anil Deshmukh serious, says NCP chief Sharad Pawar||The allegations against Maharashtra home minister and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader Anil Deshmukh is turning into a full-blown political crisis in the state. Deshmukh has been accused by former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh of asking arrested police officer Sachin Vaze to extort ₹100 crore a month from the city’s bars and restaurants.Also Read: Ex-Mumbai police chief accuses minister of extortion, throws govt into crisisNCP chief Sharad Pawar said on Sunday that allegations against Deshmukh are serious. "It is the prerogative of the CM Uddhav Thackeray to take appropriate action into the allegations," Pawar said at a press conference on the issue, adding, "There has to be in depth inquiry by such an officer who enjoy full respect in police administration."He then suggested the name of celebrated police officer Julio Ribeiro to carry out the probe.Also Watch: Deshmukh denies Param Bir Singh's allegations, BJP demands his resignationThe NCP chief further said that reinstating Vaze, who has now been arrested by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) in connection with the Antilia bomb scare, was the decision of Param Bir Singh and that not of CM or the home minister."Reinstating Vaze after 16 years and giving him an important posting were decisions taken by ex-commmissioner of police in Mumbai. And the allegations have been levelled by Singh after his removal from the post," Pawar said.The entire issue has case serious strain among the partners of the ruling Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) alliance - Shiv Sena, NCP and the Congress. While Deshmukh has accused Singh and the Mumbai Polie of “serious and unpardonable mistakes”, the Sena has come in support of Vaze. Also, in an editorial in Saamana, the party said that Singh showed commitment towards the fight against Covid-19, visited Dharavi, which was a hotbed of infections last year. It added that the TRP scam, in which Vaze had been part of the team that arrested certain accused, was brought to light under his tenure.The Congress, meanwhile, said that there is conspiracy behind the allegations against home minister Anil Deshmukh. "Attempts are being made to pull down non-BJP governments in the country. This is part of the same," party spokesman Sachin Sawant said on Sunday.But Pawar said there is no threat to the MVA government. "I don't know whether efforts are being made or not to topple the government (Maharashtra). All I can say is they will have no impact on the government."Pawar has stepped in, like on various previous instances, to resolve the latest crisis to rock the Maharashtra government. The NCP chief has been the architect of the three-party alliance to keep the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) away. He has been monitoring the functioning of the government and even held a meeting with chief minister Uddhav Thackeray after the removal of Param Bir Singh.The BJP has been targeting the ruling alliance, particularly Thackeray, demanding the resignation of Deshmukh. The BJP workers led by state unit chief Chandrakant Patil staged a protest at the Deccan area in Pune, demanding resignation of Deshmukh. BJP workers also staged protests at Kolhapur, Nagpur and Aurangabad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/allegations-against-anil-deshmukh-serious-says-ncp-supremo-sharad-pawar-101616315501733.html
21-03-2021||India||PM Modi tears into Congress’ 5 guarantees, accuses party of neglecting Assam||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday lambasted the Congress party’s five guarantees announced as part of its manifesto, ahead of the three-phased assembly polls in Assam and said the party’s rule will instead guarantee reign of corruption, nepotism, instability, appeasement and fake promises. Modi campaigned at Bokakhat in Golaghat district for Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and ally Asom Gana Parishad’s (AGP) candidates and urged voters to reject Congress and return the BJP-led government to power. AGP president Atul Bora, who is a minister in the state cabinet, is contesting from Bokakhat, which will go to polls in the first phase on March 27. “Those who ruled Assam for over 50 years are these days giving five guarantees to people of the state. But Assamese people are aware of the intentions of these people, who have the habit of making false promises. Sell dreams to the poor, tell lies, make them fight among themselves and rule over them. This has been Congress’s old formula to stay in power,” said Modi. “You have to remember Congress means guarantee of a false poll manifesto. Congress means guarantee of confusion. Congress means guarantee of instability. Congress means guarantee of bombs, guns and blockades. Congress means guarantees of violence and division. Congress means guarantee of corruption, guarantee of nepotism,” he added. Modi was referring to Congress’s five guarantees—non-implementation of Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) in Assam, ₹2000 every month to housewives, 200 units of free electricity to all households, increase in daily wages of tea garden workers to ₹365 and creation of 5 lakh government jobs—which is part of the party’s manifesto released on Saturday by Rahul Gandhi in Guwahati. “BJP and NDA governments are working towards ‘sabka saath’, ‘sabka vikas’ and ‘sabka vishwas’, but Congress is concerned only about getting power by all possible means. Actually, Congress’s coffers have become empty and they want to come to power at any cost. Congress’s only true friend is the ‘kursi’ (seat of power),” said Modi “Those with whom Congress has formed governments in Jharkhand and Maharashtra are campaigning against them in West Bengal. In Kerala, it abuses the Left, but in West Bengal it ties up with it for power. Congress calls itself secular, but in Assam, West Bengal and Kerala it has made friends with parties which are formed on communal lines. For Congress, nothing else matters but power,” he added. Modi accused the Congress of ignoring indigenous Assamese people and reminded voters that the BJP’s Sarbananda Sonowal government in the state provided land allotment certificates to nearly 300,000 landless people. The PM accused the Congress of neglecting tea-garden workers and lauded the state government for launching schemes for the community’s education, income and healthcare. He assured that once the BJP returns to power, it would take steps to increase daily wages of tea-garden workers further. “During the Congress rule, everyone was worried on how to save Assam from being looted. But during NDA rule, the state is moving ahead to touch new heights of progress. During Congress rule, there was a question on how Assam and the nation’s pride, the one-horned rhino, could be saved from poachers protected by the Congress. But our government has sent these rhino poachers behind bars,” he said. Modi spoke about road and bridge construction work in Assam, praised the increase in forest cover in the state in the past few years, congratulated the state government for giving funds to nearly 9,000 religious institutions in Assam for development of their infrastructure as part of Asom Darshan scheme. “The double-engine of the BJP government in Assam and at the Centre has worked for the state’s development. But during the Congress rule, when they had governments in state and at the Centre, there was double neglect as the grievances of Assamese people were not heard either in the state or at the Centre. Corruption was also double at that time, because local party workers and those in the Centre used to take their cuts. Infiltration was also double as the party needed to increase its vote bank,” the PM said. Assam goes to polls in three phases on March 27, April 1 and April 6. The results will be announced on May 2.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-tears-into-congress-5-guarantees-accuses-party-of-neglecting-assam-101616315203642.html

21-03-2021||India||Sharad Pawar calls NCP meet, Maharashtra ‘letter bomb’ may scalp Anil Deshmukh||Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar has convened an urgent meeting of top party leaders in Delhi on Sunday evening that may seal the fate of Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh after former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh’s damning letter alleging that Deshmukh had asked police officers to collect ₹100 crore every month.The party is expected to take a call on the replacement of Deshmukh who is also a senior NCP leader.Pawar convened the meeting in the backdrop of the huge controversy triggered by Singh’s letter to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Saturday. The letter is seen as a major embarrassment for the NCP than to the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi government.In his email, Singh, who was shunted out as Mumbai police commissioner on Wednesday, alleged that Deshmukh was indulged in malpractices and had asked suspended assistant police inspector Sachin Vaze and other officers from Mumbai police to collect ₹100 crore a month from bars, pubs, restaurants and hookah parlours.Deshmukh has refuted the allegations and has threatened to sue Singh for defamation. He has also said that Singh was making the allegations to save himself from future action as the links of the Vaze case were reaching him.“It is a huge embarrassment for the party. The allegations of ‘collection’ are directly against the party leader who has already been in soup for the inept handling of the Antilia bomb scare and Hiran death case. He may be asked to resign but a cabinet reshuffle may not happen immediately. The additional charge of the department is likely to be given to either deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar or water resources minister Jayant Patil. Pawar is believed to be not very keen on holding the home department, and in such a case Patil will be asked to hold the portfolio once again,” said a senior NCP leader who did not wish to be named.Another party leader and state health minister Rajesh Tope was reportedly another choice for the post, but the party’s top leadership said to be insisting on a stronger leader to handle the home department in the current scenario.“Tope has been doing a very good job in his incumbent portfolio, but the way the home department is in the mess currently, it needs a strong leader like Pawar or Patil. Some of the top IPS officers are believed to be in constant touch with state BJP leaders and it has proved to be detrimental to the MVA government,” the leader said.Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut too is expected to meet Sharad Pawar in Delhi on Sunday evening.According to another NCP leader, the meeting is also expected to discuss the party’s candidate for Pandharpur-Mangalvedha assembly bypoll to be held next month.“The meeting, called by NCP chief Sharad Pawar, is expected to be attended by senior party leader Praful Patel, Supriya Sule, Sunil Tatkare along with Ajit Pawar and Jayant Patil. Pawar saheb is on tour of poll-bound states and is expected to return to Delhi by afternoon. The meeting will be held in the evening at his Delhi residence,” he said.Param Bir Singh, who was removed as Mumbai’s commissioner of police on March 17, had also alleged in his letter that Deshmukh had interfered in the police force.The opposition BJP has demanded that Deshmukh resign immediately or be sacked. The BJP staged agitations across Maharashtra demanding Deshmukh’s resignation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sharad-pawar-calls-ncp-meet-maharashtra-letter-bomb-may-scalp-anil-deshmukh-101616310523584.html

The letter has added another sensational twist to the case of an explosives laden car found in front of Mukesh Ambani’s residence in Mumbai recently.“The new revelations have shown how corrupt this government is. Uddhav Thackeray should immediately sack Deshmukh and initiate inquiry against him,” said Patil.The BJP state unit chief also appealed to Raj Thackeray-led MNS and Prakash Ambedkar led Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi to join the protests.To support his allegations, Param Bir Singh enclosed various chat messages purportedly exchanged between himself and assistant commissioner of police Sanjay Patil during March 16 and 19.The latest revelations have put further pressure on the MVA government to act against Deshmukh, who is already facing allegations of mishandling the Antilia explosives case, which has resulted into embarrassment for Mumbai police and the state government after NIA arrested Sachin Vaze, the investigating officer in the case, alleging he was himself involved in the plot. The state government then shunted Param Bir Singh to fix accountability for the fiasco, however, Singh’s bombshell has now left the government red faced, once again.While Deshmukh has threatened to sue Singh, chief of his Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), Sharad Pawar has convened an urgent meeting in Delhi on Sunday evening to deal with the fallout.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-steps-up-pressure-on-uddhav-thackeray-to-act-against-anil-deshmukh-101616309803508.html

The officials, ministers, the senior leaders of the ruling party is involved in the smuggling,""The killing of RSS, BJP workers and leaders. Atrocities against women, SC and ST is on the rise," he added.Accusing the state government, Thakur alleged that the government is anti-Hindu and trying to destroy the faith and tradition of Kerala."The government is anti-Hindu, people were forced to have halal. By trying to destroy Kerala's faith and tradition, the government forget to promote the philosophy of Shankaracharya. We have seen LDF government's stand on Sabrimala issues, Love jihad issues, there was hardly any action taken by the state government when Hindu girls and Christian girls were missing," said Thakur.Taking a dig at the ruling party, Thakur claimed that, the senior leaders of the party are involved in smuggling."The officials, ministers, the senior-most leaders of the ruling party is involved in the smuggling," said Thakur.Comparing the UPA and NDA government, Thakur mentioned figures of tax devaluation, granting from the government of India, and finance commission grants during UPA and NDA government for Kerala."The tax devaluation from 2009 to 2014 during the UPA government was 29,841 crore whereas in NDA government during 2014-2019 it is 71,713 crore.

No one wants to establish a company in Kerala because of the policies of the LDF," said Thakur."The state government gets a lot of money through, remittance but even during the Covid time for those who died overseas, the LDF government shied away to give any help to those families.

The three countries had ordered 20 million each.Reuters could not immediately contact representatives for the countries or determine if they had agreed to a revised delivery schedule.SII, the single-biggest maker of vaccines, declined to comment. It has partnered with AstraZeneca, the Gates Foundation and the Gavi vaccine alliance to make up to a billion doses for poorer countries.The source, who declined to be identified, said SII was working on expanding its monthly production to 100 million doses by April/May, from 60 million to 70 million now, suggesting supplies could improve then.SII was originally supposed to sell vaccines only to middle- and low-income countries, mainly in Asia and Africa, but production issues at other AstraZeneca facilities forced it to ship to many other countries as well on the British company's behalf.India has so far donated 8 million doses and sold nearly 52 million doses to a total of 75 countries, mainly the AstraZeneca shot made by SII. India has administered more than 44 million doses since starting its immunisation campaign in the middle of January.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sii-to-delay-further-vaccine-shipments-to-brazil-morocco-saudi-arabia-report-101616306626132.html

The government had earlier set March 31 as the deadline for realising the target.The ministry added in its statement that the government is increasing the workforce of the health care centres which now includes a trained non-physician health worker with BSc Nursing/BAMS qualification, community health officer (CHO) and primary care team of health workers.The ministry also said that the AB-HWCs are not only providing services related to communicable diseases but also for non-communicable diseases such as hypertension, diabetes and cancer. Preventive health care services are also provided through the health and wellness centres and the ministry said that so far 9.1 crore screenings for hypertension, 7.4 crores screenings for diabetes, 4.7 crore screenings for oral cancer, 2.4 crores screenings for breast cancer in women and 1.7 crore screenings for cervical cancer in women have been done.The essential diagnostics list and the list of essential medicines have both been expanded, according to the ministry and tele-consultation services of more than 9.45 lakh have been provided by the HWCs till now.The health ministry also highlighted the role played by the AB-HWCs during the coronavirus pandemic, both for the prevention of Covid-19 as well as for enabling other essential health services.The government has also expanded the AB-HWC to include pregnancy care and child birth, infant health care services, health care services for children, family planning, oral health care and emergency medical services.Ayushman Bharat, the government’s flagship scheme which was launched in April 2018, aims to achieve the target of 150,000 sub-health centres and primary health centres in urban and rural areas by December 2022.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/over-70-000-health-wellness-centres-set-up-under-ayushman-bharat-ministry-101616306726708.html
21-03-2021||India||Pinarayi Vijayan to be last Communist CM of country: Chennithala||One of the contenders for the chief minister’s post if the Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF) comes to power in Kerala, Ramesh Chennithala was instrumental in unearthing many cases of alleged kickbacks like Sprinklr, Life Mission project, Deep sea fishing MoU and Backdoor entry in government service to keep the ruling dispensation under pressure. In an interview with the Hindustan Times, he spoke about the UDF’s prospects in the assembly elections, contentious Sabarimala issue and the alleged omissions and commissions of the Pinarayi Vijayan regime.Q. Most of the pre-poll surveys suggest Pinarayi Vijayan government will buck the four-decade- old trend to win a consecutive term in the state and that the going was tough for the UDF?A. We don’t believe in surveys. In the last Lok Sabha election, many surveys predicted a fifty-fifty chance for both fronts. But we swept all but one of the 20 seats. Most of the surveys were based on recent local body elections but these elections were fought on local issues. The state has never seen such a corrupt regime. The CM’s office was directly involved in smuggling and money laundering cases. Pinarayi Vijayan is going the Buddhadeb way. In Kerala, he will preside over the fall of the last Communist regime. Even the party ideology of dialectical materialism (the Marxist theory that sees political and historical events as a result of conflicts caused by material needs) was toned down and he rolled out the red carpet for companies with dubious pasts. There are not many differences between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Vijayan, both are autocratic and oppress dissent with force.Q. The government says you are raking-up the emotional Sabarimala issue eyeing votes?A. It is not true. State temple affairs minister Kadakampally Surendran took it up, expressing regrets over the incidents that unfolded at the hilltop temple three years ago. A day after party general secretary Sitaram Yechury said the government’s position was right and there was no need for any regrets over the issue. They are talking in different tones. The government is cheating believers. We always took a view to protect the interest of believers. We have already made it clear in our manifesto that we will bring a special legislation to protect age-old tradition of the temple. Sentiments of believers were hurt and we will do everything to correct them.Q. Why should people bring UDF to power?A. I think people are waiting for an opportunity to boot out the present government steeped in corruption and scandals. The government pumped in money for PR exercises to give an impression that everything was right but things were pretty bad. We all know how its publicity stunt on Covid-19 control measures went awry and the state later turned into a hub of the virus. We know the government and party recruited many cyber warriors to present a pleasant picture and attack the critics. The brutal murder of two Congress workers in north Kerala is still afresh in our mind. If voted to power, we will ensure a corruption- free and transparent regime and protect all believers. I reiterate that the government has no business to tamper with age old beliefs and customs.Q. You recently said there is a tacit understanding between the BJP-led union government and CM Vijayan?A. Our suspicion is right. Both are hand in glove. The CBI, probing the 30 year-old Lavalin kickbacks against the CM, is deliberately delaying the case. It sought time for more than 30 occasions in the apex court. And in gold smuggling and money laundering cases too, central agencies’ probes slowed down. Gold smuggling case investigation stopped abruptly after the CM’s private secretary was questioned. More than 9 months have passed since the recovery of smuggled gold from the UAE consular office but the probe is yet to reach the real beneficiaries or perpetrators. The CM is sacrificing his officials to escape the smuggling taint.Q. Are you in the race for chief minister ship if the UDF is elected to power?A. This will be decided by the party after the election. You might have noticed the candidate list. We gave opportunities to many youngsters as desired by our leader Rahul Gandhi. There was no group infighting or differences with our allies. Everything went as expected. We are united in the fight and we are sure that the incumbents will be shown the door.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pinarayi-vijayan-to-be-last-communist-cm-of-country-chennithala-101616306983239.html

"The letter is a reaction after Maharashtra Chief Minister and home minister decided to take a tough stand," the state minister said."If we ask Deshmukh to resign now, we would be doing what certain people want," Patil told Hindustan TimesIn his letter, Param Bir Singh, who has been transferred to a low-key post in Mumbai Police's Home Guards in the aftermath of the Antilia security scare, alleged that Deshmukh used to ask police officers to collect funds from bars restaurants and other establishments. He mentioned that Sachin Vaze, who is now in NIA (National Investigation Agency) custody for his alleged links with the Antilia security breach, was asked to collect ₹100 crore a month.'How many sacrifices to save king?': Who said what on Param Bir Singh's letter implicating Anil Deshmukh"Shri Sachin Vaze who was heading the Crime Intelligence Unit of the Crime Branch of the Mumbai Police was called by Shri Anil Deshmukh, Hon’ble Home Minister, Maharashtra to his official residence Dyaneshwar several times in last few months and repeatedly instructed to assist in the collection of funds for the Hon’ble Home Minister. In and around mid-February and thereafter, the Hon’ble Home Minister had called Shri Vaze to his official residence. At that time, one or two staff members of the Hon’ble Home Minister including his Personal Secretary, Mr Palande, were also present. The Hon’ble Home Minister expressed to Shri Vaze that he had a target to accumulate ₹100 crores a month. For achieving the aforesaid target, the Hon’ble Home Minister told Shri Vaze that there are about 1,750 bars, restaurants and other establishments in Mumbai and if a sum of Rs. 2-3 lakhs each was collected from each of them, a monthly collection of Rs. 40-50 crores was achievable. The Hon’ble Home Minister added that the rest of the collection could be made from other sources," a part of his letter said.The letter came to light on Saturday afternoon after it was e-mailed to the official email ID of the chief minister's secretariat — not from Param Bir Singh's official email address. The mail was unsigned too. Param Bir Singh, however, confirmed that the letter was sent from his email ID.Amid the growing chorus of the BJP demanding the resignation of the home minister, NCP leaders met at party supremo Sharad Pawar's residence on Sunday, though Jayant Patil said the meeting had nothing to do with the letter and was planned before.The letter incident puts NCP in a spot not only because Anil Deshmukh is from the party, but also because Sharad Pawar is considered the architect of the three-party Maha Vikas Aghadi government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/param-bir-singh-letter-no-question-of-replacing-anil-deshmukh-says-ncp-leader-jayant-patil-101616306402806.html

He has worked closely with the faculty and founders over the years to take the University into a position of being rightly acknowledged as a great centre of learning, teaching and research," the statement read.On Subramanian's exit, the statement read, "Arvind brought eminence, stature, fresh ideas and energy to the University. He is one of the premier thinkers about the Indian and the global economy. He leaves a void that will be hard to fill."News of Mehta’s exit broke on Thursday — he resigned on March 15 — and caused a stir among students and faculty of the university, and the academic community across India and overseas. “After a meeting with Founders it has become abundantly clear to me that my association with the University may be considered a political liability. My public writing in support of a politic that tries to honour constitutional values of freedom and equal respect for all citizens is perceived to carry risks for the university. In the interests of the University, I resign,” he said in his resignation letter.Faculty members also wrote to V-C Malabika Sarkar saying that Mehta’s exit would set a “chilling precedent”. Sheldon Pollock, a Sanskrit scholar who is closely associated with Ashoka University, also issued a statement on Thursday expressing his solidarity with Mehta.On Friday morning, his colleague and former chief economic adviser Subramanian resigned saying he was “devastated” by Mehta’s resignation, and it reflected the university’s inability to protect “academic freedom and expression”.The students’ body at Ashoka University on Saturday announced a “two-day boycott of classes” next week to protest the resignation of two professors, even as more academics -- including former Reserve Bank of India governor Raghuram Rajan -- weighed in and expressed their support for Mehta and his departure on fears that he could be a “political liability” for the university on account of his strong political views.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lapses-will-be-rectified-pratap-bhanu-mehta-ashoka-university-chief-issue-joint-statement-101616301568071.html

This is the first time the two top leaders of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) will be seen in action on the same day in the state during this election season, marked by frequent visits by Union ministers and top saffron camp leaders from north and central Indian states. PM Modi will arrive in Bengal on Sunday afternoon and address a rally at 1 pm in Bankura district where the BJP won two seats in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls and made deep inroads in the tribal belts. Shah arrived in Kolkata late on Saturday night, BJP leaders said. He will address his first rally around noon at Egra in East Midnapore district, where former Trinamool Congress (TMC) minister Suvendu Adhikari is contesting against chief minister Mamata Banerjee at the Nandigram seat. Shah will address party workers at Mecheda in the same district at 1.30 pm. He will return to Kolkata and release the BJP’s election manifesto at 4 pm. Suvendu Adhikari’s father Sisir Adhikari, the octogenarian TMC Lok Sabha member from Contai in East Midnapore, has been invited to Shah’s rally at Egra, BJP leaders said. He is likely to join the BJP. His eldest son, Dibyendu, is the TMC Lok Sabha member from Tamluk. He, too, has been invited to join the BJP. “My father may join the BJP,” Dibyendu Adhikari told reporters on Saturday night but remained noncommittal on his next move. Soumendu, the youngest son of the family, joined the saffron camp in December last year. He was head of the TMC-run Contai municipality. While addressing a rally at Haldia in East Midnapore on Saturday, the chief minister targeted the Adhikari family, calling the members “traitors”. “I fed some traitors for years. Those who joined the BJP have done so to escape jail sentence. I am relieved that they left. They always controlled my movement and I had to seek their permission before coming here,” Banerjee said. Reacting to this, Sisir Adhikari alleged Banerjee was in a habit of insulting her party leaders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/modi-shah-rallies-in-bengal-today-adhikari-s-father-may-join-bjp-101616302542677.html

Is it what the so called third front is going to do finally ? Congress must take a stand on this issue," he tweeted.The demand by Nirupam came even as the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) state government, comprising Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress, is reeling under the impact of the "letter bomb" by the serving IPS officer.A former Shiv Sena leader, Nirupam joined the Congress in 2005.In the eight-page letter to Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray, Singh alleged that Deshmukh used to call police officers to his official residence and give them a "collection target" from bars, restaurants and other establishments.The Chief Minister's Office, in a late night release, said Singh's "unsigned letter to Thackeray" was not sent from his official email ID and efforts were on to contact him to verify it.Ending the speculation, Singh later confirmed that he indeed emailed the letter, a signed copy of which will reach the government shortly.The IPS officer claimed that the minister told Waze that he had set a target of collecting ₹100 crore a month, half of it from nearly 1,750 bars, restaurants and similar establishments operating in the city.Singh also claimed that Deshmukh "from day one" wanted a case of abetment of suicide to be registered in Mumbai after the death of Dadra and Nagar Haveli MP Mohan Delkar in a Mumbai hotel last month.Sources in the Shiv Sena-NCP-Congress state government said Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray and NCP chief Sharad Pawar are yet to take a call on replacing the home minister in the backdrop of the latest controversy.BJP leader and former Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis sought Deshmukh's the resignation over the claims made by the IPS officer."We demand the home minister's resignation. If he doesn't, then Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray must remove him. An impartial probe must be conducted. The letter also says the chief minister was informed about this earlier, so why didn't he act on it?" said Fadnavis, Leader of the Opposition in Maharashtra Assembly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-must-take-stand-on-param-bir-s-claim-says-former-mp-sanjay-nirupam-101616301628193.html

In the letter, Singh alleged that Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh had indulged in "malpractices" and asked assistant police inspector Sachin Waze to collect ₹100 crore every month from bars and restaurants. Waze has been arrested by NIA (National Investigation Agency) because of his alleged links with the Antilia security breach incident and the following death of Thane-based businessman Mansukh Hiran, whose car was found parked near Ambani house carrying explosives and a threat letter. After Mumbai police's link to the incident came to the fore, Param Bir Singh was removed from the post of commissioner.Home minister Anil Deshmukh said he will file a defamation suit against Param Vir Singh for the "false allegations".Congress must take a stand, says former MP Sanjay Nirupam"If at all, whatever Parambir Singh is saying is truth, question should be asked from Hon Sharad Pawar ji because he is the architect of current Maharashtra Govt.

21-03-2021||India||Government seeks justice Bobde’s recommendation on next CJI||The government has initiated the process of appointment of the next Chief Justice of India (CJI) by seeking the recommendation from present CJI Sharad Arvind Bobde, who will retire on April 23. Union law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad is learnt to have written to CJI Bobde on Friday, asking him to recommend the name of the next CJI, as is the practice under the Memorandum of Procedure for Appointment of Chief Justice of India.As per protocol, the senior most judge after the CJI is entitled to hold this constitutional office. But the procedure requires the law minister to seek the recommendation of the outgoing CJI “at the appropriate time” for appointing the next Chief Justice of India. This recommendation has to come at least a month before the vacancy arises. Justice NV Ramana is the next in line to become the CJI. On appointment, he has a long tenure as CJI for over 16 months. Before making the recommendation, if the CJI has any doubt about the fitness of the senior most judge to hold the highest judicial office of the country, Article 124(2) of the Constitution allows the CJI to consult other judges of the top court.“After receipt of the recommendation of the Chief Justice of India, the Union Minister of Law, Justice and Company Affairs will put up the recommendation to the Prime Minister who will advise the President in the matter of appointment,” the Memorandum of Procedure states.Justice Ramana became a permanent judge of the Andhra Pradesh high court in June 2000 and was elevated to the Supreme Court in February 2014. On October 6 last year, the chief minister of Andhra Pradesh YS Jaganmohan Reddy wrote a letter to CJI Bobde alleging justice Ramana was trying to expedite criminal cases pending against him in various courts of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana.The letter followed days after a bench headed by justice Ramana passed an order in a PIL filed by BJP leader and lawyer Ashwini Kumar Upadhyay to fast-track criminal cases pending against lawmakers. The CJI is yet to decide on this letter after considering the response of justice Ramana.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/government-seeks-justice-bobde-s-recommendation-on-next-cji-101616296422279.html

Last year, during the early outbreak of the pandemic, the state was caught in a political crisis, as the incumbent government fell making way for the BJP government, which was blamed for the mismanagement of the pandemic situation at that time.As the overall Covid-19 situation in the country has been worsening with the infection spreading unabated, Madhya Pradesh has again emerged as a cause of concern in 2021. In the past week, the state saw the highest daily surge in the year.Here is all you need to know about the Madhya Pradesh Covid-19 situation> On Saturday, the states added 1,308 fresh infections, which was the second consecutive day that the daily infection tally breached the 1,000-mark.

21-03-2021||India||‘ECI targeting us’: TMC slams order to remove politicians heading civic bodies||The Election Commission of India (ECI) on Saturday ordered that politicians in West Bengal, appointed as administrative heads of civic corporations and municipalities beyond their terms, should be replaced by government officers by 10 am on Monday, triggering a sharp reaction from the Trinamool Congress (TMC) leaders, who said it was a move against the ruling party prior to the eight-phase assembly polls, beginning on March 27.Saturday’s order, the ECI said, was passed “to avoid a situation where critical functions of urban local bodies are actually discharged, thereby affecting the level playing field during the operation of Model Code of Conduct….” Since the administrators are politically affiliated persons, the present situation may “give rise to a legitimate apprehension in the mind of the voters about the fairness and impartiality of the election process,” the ECI said.The TMC controls most of the 120 civic bodies in Bengal. The terms of the elected boards ended last year but fresh elections were not held because of the Covid-19 pandemic. The state government appointed the elected heads of the civic boards as administrators till fresh polls are held. For example, urban development minister Firhad Hakim, who was the mayor of Kolkata, was reappointed as administrative head of the Kolkata Municipal Corporation’s board.The ruling TMC is under pressure to protect its turf from the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) bid to dethrone the party in this assembly election, which will see the first phase of voting on March 27 and conclude with the eighth phase of polling on April 29. The results will be announced on May 2.The ECI asked the government to set up a committee headed by the chief secretary for appointment of officials who will serve as administrators or heads of board of administrators during the elections.“The ECI’s order directly targets the TMC since it won most of the civic body elections. The appointment of the administrators was earlier challenged at the Calcutta high court. The court did not entertain the demand for their removal. The ECI has done what the high court didn’t,” said TMC Lok Sabha member and party spokesperson Saugata Roy.“The ECI has simply followed the rules,” said Samik Bhattacharya, Bengal BJP's chief spokesperson of the BJP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/eci-targeting-us-tmc-slams-order-to-remove-politicians-heading-civic-bodies-101616295281949.html

However, they will have to first register at cowin.gov.in."The vaccine has now been made available to help prevent Covid-19 and it is necessary to speed up the vaccination drive. In this regard, the government has made arrangements to vaccinate senior citizens above 60 years of age and those with co-morbidities in the age group of 45-59 years. Citizens in the above-mentioned age groups are thereby appealed to register successfully on the Co-WIN portal and visit their nearest vaccination centre to get vaccinated without waiting for the date of the scheduled appointment," the civic body said in a statement.Speeding Up The Vaccination Drive!Citizens eligible for vaccination can now, after successful registration at https://t.co/QYkqAzBenq, visit the center nearest to them and get vaccinated without any delay.There is no need to wait till the scheduled date.#JabToBeatTheVirus https://t.co/8BzsmQISaeAmid surge, BMC to conduct random tests at public places without consentMumbai on Saturday reported 2,982 new infections, slightly lower than its previous day's infection tally.

Instead, the authorities are working towards tightening surveillance and covering the maximum people under vaccination.Here is all you need to know about Mumbai's present Covid-19 situation> Mumbai has a 91 per cent recovery rate, while the doubling rate is 114 days. This means the number of cases is getting doubled in 114 days.> There are 34 active containment zones and 302 active sealed buildings in the city.> From Monday, the civic body will be conducting rapid antigen tests at crowded places like railway stations, malls and markets.> The consent of the person will not be required for the test and if someone does not comply, action will be taken against them under Epidemic At 1987.> There will be a minimum of 400 tests daily at each mall in the city.> At railway stations and bus depots, the target is to carry out 1,000 daily tests per station or depot.> There will be a minimum of1,000 daily tests at hotels, markets, tourist spots per ward.> The cost of the test will be borne by the civic authorities except in malls.> Prospective beneficiaries of vaccines won't have to wait for their scheduled date of vaccination. This will quicken the pace of the inoculation drive in the city. It is also likely to address the issue of vaccine wastage.

21-03-2021||India||Cong MPs ‘dissociate’ from Parl panel report||In an unusual move, three Congress MPs have written to the Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla to “dissociate” themselves from a standing committee’s report that asked the Centre to “implement the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020 in letter and spirit”. The three MPs, members of the House panel on food, consumer affairs and public distribution, also alleged that the report was approved in the panel chairman’s absence.Saptagiri Ulaka from Odisha’s Koraput, V Vaithilingam of Puducherry and Kasargod’s Rajmohan Unnithan have written to the Speaker against the Eleventh report of the House panel on Food, Consumer Affairs and Public Distribution. The report, titled “Price Rise of Essential Commodities – Causes and Effects”, was adopted on March 18 and presented in Parliament the following day. The panel is headed by Trinamool Congress leader Sudip Bandyopadhyay. The Congress MPs “completely dissociated” from the panel’s recommendation” to implement the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020 in letter and spirit…” The amendments to the ESA are one of the three laws being opposed by many farm unions, the Congress and other opposition parties. The report recommended that “the Government implement the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020 in letter and spirit, and without let or hindrances so that the farmers and other stakeholders of farming sector in this country receive the benefits intended under the said Act.”The dissenting MPs maintained that their position “in line with the stand expressed by the Congress Party, where it opposed tooth and nail the implementation of the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020, as it impinges on federalism, encourages hoarding and black-marketing, and therefore demand its immediate repeal.” Ulaka said he earlier expr-essed his opposition in a meeting in December. Bandopadhyay said the “Trinamool is also opposed to the farm laws” and said the panel suggested that “foodstuffs such as potato, onions and pulses are part of a common man’s daily diet and that lakhs of people who do not get the benefits of Public Distribution System may suffer adversely in the aftermath of the implementation of the new Act..”Senior Congress strategist Jairam Ramesh quoted Ulaka’s letter and said, “MPs of the Congress party did not ask for implementation of the ESA. The Standing Committee Report is a misrepresentation!” TMC floor leader in the Rajya Sabha Derek O’Brien targeted the BJP for the adoption of the report and tweeted: “This is the BJP cheap ‘n dirty tricks department in action. Con job was done when Chairman of #Parliament Committee was not at meeting. @aitc position on #FarmLaws and Essential Commodities Act well documented. Withdraw draconian laws #FarmersProtest.”The Congress MPs also raised an objection that the report was adopted under “acting chairperson” Ajay “Teni” Misra, a BJP MP from UP. “...I was not present when the Report was adopted as the meeting was called in a short notice of merely 15 hours, on the adoption of a report on the very important subject of ‘Price Rise of Essential Commodities’,” read Ulaka’s letter posted on Twitter. Rejecting the charges, Bandopadhyay said: “There is nothing called as an acting chairperson. The final meeting went for two days—March 17 and 18. One the first day, NC leader Farooq Abdullah chaired the meeting... the report has been adopted properly and all rules have been adhered to.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cong-mps-dissociate-from-parl-panel-report-101616281843998.html

TRS candidate Palla Rajeshwar Reddy, who is fighting the elections for the second consecutive time, was leading the table during the counting of second preferential votes when the last reports came in.Vani Devi, who contested the election on the Telangana Rashtra Samithi ticket, defeated her nearest rival N Ramachander Rao of Bharatiya Janata Party, who is the sitting MLC from the constituency. She secured 1,87,339 votes in the final round after counting of second preferential votes, as against 1,68,520 votes required for winning the seat, accounting for 50 per cent of the total votes polled.Vani Devi secured 1,12,689 first preferential votes (around 33 per cent). As a result, the election authorities took up the process of eliminating the other contenders and transferring their second preference votes to those who stood at the top.Apart from the BJP candidate, two others – G Chinna Reddy of the Congress and K Nageshwar, a former MLC who contested as an independent – stood among the top contenders. In the penultimate elimination round, only Ramachander Rao remained in the race with 1,37,566 votes, while Vani Devi was leading with 1,49,269. And in the final round, the second preferential votes of the BJP candidate were transferred to Vani Devi, who was declared elected with 1,87,339 votes.It was a sort of moral victory for the TRS to wrest the seat from the BJP, after its loss in the by-election to Dubbak assembly seat and the subsequent debacle in the elections to the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation.The TRS took these MLC elections very prestigiously because they reflect the mood of the educated voters and a defeat would definitely have its impact on the forthcoming by-election to Nagarjunasagar assembly seat to be held on April 17, besides ensuing elections to Khammam and Warangal municipal corporations.TRS president and chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao made all-out efforts to ensure victory for the TRS in the MLC elections. He roped a large number of ministers, including his son KT Rama Rao, daughter K Kavitha and nephew T Harish Rao, into the campaign. The choice of Vani Devi was also a strategic one as it comes at a time when the state has been celebrating the birth centenary of her father PV Narasimha Rao, the only Telangana leader to rise to the position of Prime Minister of the country. Thus, KCR successfully triggered this Telangana sentiment once again and secured the victory to the party.Several TRS leaders, including KT Rama Rao, Harish Rao and their cabinet colleagues, congratulated Vani Devi for winning the MLC seat. “It is an endorsement of KCR’s policies by the educated voters,” Harish Rao said.BJP official spokesman K Krishnasagar Rao said the BJP would respect the mandate given by the graduate voters and humbly accept the electoral outcome. He, however, alleged that KCR had crowded the contest by ensuring multiple social influencers in the fray, which was an unethical attempt to confuse the electorate and split the BJP vote.Congress candidate Chinna Reddy said the TRS had won the MLC elections purely because of its money power and it was unfortunate that the unemployed graduates were sold out to the ruling party.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/expm-pv-narasimha-rao-s-daughter-elected-in-telangana-mlc-elections-101616267317543.html
21-03-2021||India||Centre hands Hiran murder case to NIA||The Centre on Saturday suo motu handed over the probe into Thane businessman Mansukh Hiran’s death to the National Investigation Agency (NIA), which has been probing the SUV laden with explosives found outside industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s residence last month.The NIA will take over the case from the Maharashtra Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS), which has been investigating the possible murder of Hiran, a 48-year-old Thane-based auto spare parts dealer, who is linked to the Scorpio that was found with 20 loose gelatin sticks, and a threatening letter addressed to the Ambanis, outside their Antilia residence on February 25.NIA officials will take over case files including the post mortem report of Hiran after re-registering the FIR filed by the ATS on March 7 against unknown persons for the charge of murder. The NIA arrested suspended police officer Sachin Vaze on March 13 for purportedly planting the explosives in the Scorpio. The ATS has also questioned Vaze over his role in Hiran’s death after it came to light through the statement of Hiran’s wife, Vimla, that the two knew each other.The ATS on Saturday sought Vaze’s custody in the murder investigation, but the NIA special court scheduled the hearing to March 25, when his custody with the NIA ends.The ministry of home affairs (MHA) used its power under Section 8 of the NIA Act, which says that any connected offence related to a scheduled offence already under investigation, in which the suspect is same, can also be taken over by the central anti-terror agency.Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut on Saturday said the NIA taking over the probe into Hiran’s death was not a setback to the Mumbai police or the Maharashtra government. “There was no need for the NIA to take up the probe into the explosives-laden SUV and Mansukh Hiran case. However, the Centre is looking for opportunities to see how the MVA government can be put in a spot. You can bring the CIA or KGB...It makes no difference...,” he added.With inputs from Manish K Pathak and Faisal Tandel||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-hands-hiran-murder-case-to-nia-101616265516440.html
21-03-2021||India||Ashoka students seek return of professors||The students’ body at Ashoka University on Saturday announced a “two-day boycott of classes” next week to protest the resignation of two professors, Pratap Bhanu Mehta and Arvind Subramanian, even as more academics -- including former Reserve Bank of India governor Raghuram Rajan -- weighed in and expressed their support for Mehta and his departure on fears that he could be a “political liability” for the university on account of his strong political views.In a statement released on Saturday, the Ashoka Student Government demanded “public acknowledgement by the founders” of Mehta’s statement about “political liability” and an assurance that he will be “given a public unconditional offer letter”; an open meeting between the founders and the students’ body; and the “divesting of administrative powers and roles from the founders” to the “elected representatives of faculty, students, and administration”. The statement added that the students would protest till these demands were met, and added that if they were not “met by Tuesday” (March 23), the students would “organise a separate movement demanding that the Vice-Chancellor resign”.The university and the founders have so far not offered their version of events.During a townhall with students on Thursday, VC Sarkar rejected allegations that Mehta was asked to resign due to his role as a government critic. “I spoke to Pratap and tried to persuade him multiple times not to leave Ashoka and to withdraw his resignation,” she said.News of Mehta’s exit broke on Thursday — he resigned on March 15 — and caused a stir among students and faculty of the university, and the academic community across India and overseas. “After a meeting with Founders it has become abundantly clear to me that my association with the University may be considered a political liability. My public writing in support of a politic that tries to honour constitutional values of freedom and equal respect for all citizens is perceived to carry risks for the university. In the interests of the University, I resign,” he said in his resignation letter.Faculty members also wrote to V-C Malabika Sarkar saying that Mehta’s exit would set a “chilling precedent”. Sheldon Pollock, a Sanskrit scholar who is closely associated with Ashoka University, also issued a statement on Thursday expressing his solidarity with Mehta.On Friday morning, his colleague and former chief economic adviser Subramanian resigned saying he was “devastated” by Mehta’s resignation, and it reflected the university’s inability to protect “academic freedom and expression”.Late on Friday, around 150 academics from overseas universities wrote an open letter terming Mehta’s exit as a “dangerous attack on academic freedom”.In the letter, addressed to Ashoka trustees, administration, and the faculty, the academics express their “distress” over Mehta’s resignation under “political pressure”. “A prominent critic of the current Indian government and defender of academic freedom, he had become a target for his writings. It seems that Ashoka’s Trustees, who should have treated defending him as their institutional duty, instead all but forced his resignation,” it read.The signatories included Homi K Bhabha, Anne F Rothenberg, professor of humanities at Harvard University; Erwin Chemerinsky, dean at the University of California Berkeley School of Law; Rogers Smith, Partha Chatterjee of Columbia University; Faisal Devji, professor of Indian history, University of Oxford; and Lawrence Lessig of Harvard Law School.The university alumni council on Friday held a meeting to discuss the future course of action in order to “protect the academic freedom in the university”.On Saturday, Rajan weighed in on LinkedIn. He wrote that “free speech” is the soul of a great university and by “compromising on it, the founders (of Ashoka) have bartered away its soul”. “The reality is that professor Mehta is a thorn in the side of the establishment. He is no ordinary thorn because he skewers those in government and in high offices like the Supreme Court with vivid prose and thought-provoking arguments,” he added.HT learns that on Friday, some of the founders met Mehta and sought his return. Ashoka University did not respond to queries, saying a statement on the matter will be issued soon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ashoka-students-seek-return-of-professors-101616265397092.html
21-03-2021||India||A skilled planner, Hosabale rises through Sangh ranks||Dattatreya Hosabale, 66, replaced Suresh Bhaiyyaji Joshi, 73 as the general secretary of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) on Saturday, signalling a significant change ahead of the Sangh’s centenary celebrations that will begin in 2024.Hosabale’s appointment was announced at the ongoing Akhil Bharatiya Pratinidhi Sabha, the meeting of the highest decision-making body of the Sangh, in Bengaluru.His appointment comes at a time when the Sangh is in an expansion mode and has set itself the task of opening at least one Shakha, or unit, in every mandal or a cluster of 10-12 villages ahead of its centenary celebrations. While the ties between the Bharatiya Janata Party, and its ideological parent, the Sangh have become increasingly synergistic over the past decade, it wasn’t always that way, and analysts said it will interesting to watch the interplay between both as they expand .In the Sangh, the general secretary is the deputy to the chief or the sarsanghchalak but is largely seen as a key figure in decision making and everyday running of the organisation.Hosabale’s skills as a planner and an organisational leader, displayed during his stint with the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) or the students’ wing of the RSS and the ease with which he balances the Sangh’s ideological position with political pragmatism have been pivotal in his selection for the crucial position, said people familiar with the thinking behind his appointment who asked not to be named.“His ability to straddle the ideology of the Sangh and BJP’s politics are well known and will be put to good use as the Sangh prepares for its expansion as well as acts as a guiding force for the BJP that will also face a test in 2024 (general elections),” said one of them, a senior RSS functionary.A joint general secretary of the RSS since 2009, Hosabale was in the reckoning for the position for the last six years. In 2018, when the last elections took place, there was a section of the cadre that pushed for a younger, more articulate Hosable to replace Joshi, who served as second-in-command for three terms. Joshi went on to complete his fourth term.In 2018, when speculation about Dattatreya being appointed the general secretary arose, a section within the Sangh was reported to have expressed concern over the insinuation that his promotion was being linked to his ties with PM Narendra Modi. Many felt that his equation with the PM could influence the Sangh’s work.“There were fears that the Sangh, which is known to not shy away from taking a stand against government policies, could soften its stand. But the Sangh follows a robust process and does not intervene in political decision making,” said a second person familiar with the matter, also a senior Sangh functionary.Rakesh Sinha, BJP member of Rajya Sabha and an author who was extensively written on the Sangh, said Hosabale has been a driving force behind the Sangh’s efforts to reach out to marginalised sections of society.“He has the capacity to contextualise the ideology as per emerging trends and socio-economic forces. He believes in discourse and dialogue and consequently even those opposed to the Sangh enjoy engaging with him. He represents Sangh’s model of outreach,” Sinha said.Keeping in view that a larger section of the karyakartas (volunteers) is under 50, Hosable who is younger than Joshi is expected to have a better understanding of the “aspirations and the changed thought process of the cadre”, said a third RSS functionary.And Hosabale is also perceived to be Sangh’s liberal face. “While there is no question of diluting the Sangh’s ideology; there is a need to be more inclusive. It was Dattaji who articulated the Sangh’s view on controversial issues such as homosexuality,” the second person added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/a-skilled-planner-hosabale-rises-through-sangh-ranks-101616264796353.html
21-03-2021||India||120 million doses ordered as vaccine urgency deepens||The Union government has placed orders for 120 million more doses of coronavirus vaccines with Serum Institute of India (SII) and Bharat Biotech, moving to secure more stocks at a time when officials and experts are calling for speedier delivery as a new wave of infections takes holds in several parts of the country.Of the 120 million doses, 100 million will be of Covishield being manufactured by SII. The remaining will be of Covaxin by Bharat Biotech. The two are the only vaccines approved in India till now for use among people.From adding an average of 15,494 cases a day at the beginning of March, the country recorded close to 32,000 cases daily over the last week on an average. Experts and the leaders of at least three states – Delhi, Maharashtra and Kerala – have urged the Union government to either allow more people to become eligible for doses or ramp up supplies.As on Saturday, India has delivered 43.6 million doses of the two vaccines. The vaccination of the first of the general population (people above age of 60 and those older than 45 with particular medical illnesses) began on March 1 and by March 28, the ones who have had their initial doses will need to get their second shots.“The procurement was to happen in phases -- that has been the plan all long. This is so that when more options open up, which is going to happen in some time, the basket of choice will expand. Also, as demand increases, the cost of vaccines also comes down, which is why it helps to not procure in bulk in one go,” said a senior government official aware of the matter, asking not to be named.India aims to give doses to 300 million people – health workers, frontline workers and those at highest risk due to their age or comorbid conditions -- by the end of July. But experts now believe as many people as possible should now be allowed to take the doses in order to head off this new wave of cases.“The vaccination strategy, I think, should remove the age bar if the vaccines are available in plenty. The government is doing it phase-wise, but we need to vaccinate anybody over the age of 18 and quickly. For a state like Maharashtra, vaccinating more people now would not be of much help because the cases have already spread. But, in the case of Delhi and other parts of the country where the surge hasn’t started yet, it will,” said Dr SK Sarin, director of the Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences.Maharashtra on Saturday added over 27,000 cases – the most it has recorded on a single day – and at present accounts for the highest share of new cases among any states. In Delhi, the health bulletin said 813 new cases were recorded – the highest since December 24. The proportion of samples testing positive is also the highest since December 27, although – at 1.07% -- it is comfortably under the ideal threshold of 4%.Experts said the immediate need to accelerate vaccines is even more acute since the two vaccines India uses offer protection two weeks after the second shot – which means a person will be adequately protected only after 42 days after the begin their dosing.According to Dr Raman Gangakhedkar, former head of the epidemiology division at the Indian Council of Medical Research, the mRNA vaccines produce quicker protection against the Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. “The mRNA vaccines produce some immunity within 12 to 13 days of being given the first shot,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/120mn-doses-ordered-as-vaccine-urgency-deepens-101616264676262.html
