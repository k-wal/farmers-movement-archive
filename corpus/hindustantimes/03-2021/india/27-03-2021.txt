27-03-2021||India||PM Modi wraps up Bangladesh visit, calls for greater bilateral cooperation||Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Bangladesh counterpart Sheikh Hasina on Saturday reviewed progress in development and connectivity initiatives even as the two countries signed five agreements in areas ranging from trade to disaster management.On the second and final day of his first foreign visit since the Covid-19 outbreak last year, Modi held one-on-one talks with Hasina in Dhaka. This was followed by delegation-level talks that lasted more than an hour. The two leaders discussed progress in areas such as trade, connectivity, health, energy and developmental cooperation, according to external affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi.The two sides signed five memorandums of understanding (MoUs) covering disaster management and mitigation, establishment of a framework for cooperation in trade remedial measures, establishment of sports facilities at Rajshahi College, cooperation between Bangladesh National Cadet Corps and India’s National Cadet Corps, and the supply of ICT equipment, reference books and training for the Bangladesh-Bharat Digital Service and Employment Training Centre.“Had a productive meeting with PM Sheikh Hasina. We reviewed the full range of India-Bangladesh relations and discussed ways to deepen economic and cultural linkages in the times to come,” Modi tweeted. The new MoUs will add strength to the development partnership and benefit the people of the two sides, especially the youth, he said.Modi handed over a symbolic key to Hasina for 109 ambulances gifted by India, and also donated 1.2 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines as a grant.The two leaders virtually inaugurated several projects, including three border “haats” or markets and the extended development of Rabindra Bhawan at Shilaidaha Kuthibari, a country house in Kushtia where Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore spent a part of his life. They virtually laid the foundation stone for the development of infrastructure at the Rooppur nuclear power plant being jointly built by Russia and India.Also read: Foreign secretary gives overview of PM Modi, Sheikh Hasina meeting - 7 pointsHasina presented gold and silver coins released to mark the birth centenary of her father, “Bongobandhu” Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, to Modi. The two leaders released postage stamps marking 50 years of diplomatic relations.Modi’s visit coincided with celebrations marking the birth centenary of Rahman and 50 years of Bangladesh’s liberation war. On Friday, Modi was the only foreign leader invited to attend celebrations marking the golden jubilee of Bangladesh’s independence, and he called for greater bilateral cooperation to confront shared challenges such as terrorism and to boost trade and connectivity.Earlier on Saturday, Modi became the first foreign head of government to visit Bongobandhu’s mausoleum at Tungipara. He also visited two historic Hindu temples at Satkhira and Orakandi, a move with symbolic significance for elections in the Indian states of West Bengal and Assam, which share borders with Bangladesh.Hasina and her sister Sheikh Rehana took Modi around the mausoleum complex in Tungipara. He paid tribute at the grave of Bongobandhu and planted a “bakul” tree sapling to commemorate the historic event. Modi also signed the visitors’ book at the mausoleum and wrote that the life of Bongobandhu “epitomised the freedom struggle of the people of Bangladesh for their rights, for the preservation of their inclusive culture and their identity”.Modi began the day by performing puja at the centuries-old Jeshoreshwari Kali Shaktipeeth in Satkhira, a temple dedicated to Goddess Kali and one of 51 shaktipeeths of the Puranic tradition. He placed a handmade “mukut” of silver with gold plating, which was crafted by a local artisan in three weeks, on the idol.He also announced a grant for building a community hall-cum-cyclone shelter at the temple complex. This structure will be used during the temple’s annual Kali puja and mela and also serve as a storm shelter and community facility.At Orakandi, Modi sought blessings at the Hari Mandir and interacted with descendants of Harichand Thakur, a Hindu mystic and spiritual guru. He addressed members of the Matua community and said India and Bangladesh want to see the progress of the whole world through their development and progress. Both countries want stability, love and peace instead of instability, terror and unrest, and these were the same values preached by Harichand Thakur, he said.Modi said India is moving forward with the slogan of “Sabka saath, sabka vikas and sabka vishwas”, and Bangladesh is a “shoho jatri” (fellow traveller) in these efforts. At the same time, Bangladesh is a strong example of development and change for the world and India is Bangladesh’s “shoho jatri” in these efforts, he said.Watch | What did PM Modi pray for at Bangladesh's Kaali temple? Watch his answerHe announced several initiatives, including upgrading the middle school for girls at Orakandi and the setting up of a primary school. He said steps will be taken to ease the travel of a large number of people who come from India to Orakandi every year to participate in “Baruni Snan” on the birth anniversary of Harichand Thakur.Orakandi is home to the Hindu Matua community, a large number of whom also live in West Bengal. Modi was accompanied by Shantanu Thakur, a BJP MP from West Bengal, for the visit to Orakandi, and observers said the trip had political significance against the backdrop of the elections in West Bengal.The Matua community’s vote is expected to determine the winners in some seats in the West Bengal assembly.“My visit to the Orakandi Thakurbari is an experience I will remember for life. This is a very sacred place, which is closely associated with the Matua community,” Modi tweeted.Modi has described Bangladesh as a key pillar of India’s “Neighbourhood First” policy, while Hasina has referred to India as a “true friend” and said both sides can play a significant role in global and regional value chains by further integrating their economies and boosting connectivity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-wraps-up-bangladesh-visit-calls-for-greater-bilateral-cooperation-101616868159163.html

27-03-2021||India||BJP MLA thrashed by protesting farmers in Punjab, Amarinder Singh condemns incident||A BJP MLA in Punjab was allegedly thrashed and his clothes torn by a group of farmers at Malout in Muktsar district on Saturday, police said.BJP leaders have been facing the ire of farmers for the last several months in the state. Agitating farmers have been opposing the programmes of the saffron party leaders in the state over the farm laws issue.When Abohar legislator Arun Narang reached Malout on Saturday along with local leaders to address a press conference, they were surrounded by a group of protesting farmers and black ink was thrown at them and at their vehicles, officials said.Some police personnel took the MLA and local leaders to a shop. But later when they came out of it, the protesters allegedly thrashed Narang and tore his clothes, police said.Policemen escorting Narang faced a tough time in protecting him from the protesters. The legislator was later escorted to a safe place by the police, officials said.Deputy Superintendent of Police (Malout) Jaspal Singh said the protesters were adamant that they would not allow the BJP legislators to hold the press conference.A video has surfaced on social media, purportedly showing the MLA in torn clothes being shifted to a safer place by the police.Later, Narang told PTI that he was "punched" by some people."I was punched a lot and my clothes were also torn off," he alleged.The BJP legislator said he had gone to Malout to address a press conference but the protesters did not allow it. They got violent and surrounded him, the MLA claimed.Asked whether he has lodged a complaint in this matter, Narang said he will talk to the party leadership over this issue.Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh strongly condemned the alleged attack on Narang and also warned of strict action against anyone trying to disturb peace in the state.He urged the farmers not to indulge in such acts of violence, and appealed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to urgently resolve the crisis triggered by the passage of farm laws in parliament last year to prevent the situation from escalating.The chief minister directed the police chief to take strict action against the perpetrators of the incident, who also clashed with the police personnel trying to rescue the legislator.Superintendent of Police (Headquarters), Faridkot, was injured while trying to save and evacuate the MLA. He suffered a cane blow on his head, causing his turban to fall off. He was admitted in Civil Hospital, Malout, the CM said in a statement.The DGP said a criminal case will be registered against the suspects and statements of local BJP leaders were being recorded.Amarinder Singh said while protesting is the democratic right of the farmers, violence of any sorts would not be tolerated.Reacting to the demand for his resignation by Punjab BJP leaders, he said instead of trying to take political mileage from Saturday's incident, they should put pressure on their central leadership to withdraw the contentious farm laws.Punjab Assembly Speaker Rana KP Singh also strongly condemned the alleged attack on Narang at Malout."It is not only unacceptable, but highly condemnable that an elected representative of the people was mercilessly thrashed in full public view," he said.Darshan Pal, the leader of Samyukta Kisan Morcha, an umbrella body of farmers' union spearheading the agitation against the central agri laws, said, "Today, farmers protested against BJP MLA from Abohar. Under adverse circumstances, it turned violent and the MLA was physically assaulted."It is a matter of regret that an elected representative was treated this way. We do not encourage such behaviour. We strongly condemn this act," he said in a statement.Pal also said the Samyukta Kisan Morcha appeals to all protesters to remain peaceful and disciplined.The ruling Congress in Punjab, the BJP, as well as the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) condemned the incident.Such "unlawful behaviour" has no place in a democracy and the farmers' protest will be weakened by these incidents, State Congress chief Sunil Jakhar said.BJP national general secretary Tarun Chugh slammed the Amarinder Singh-led government over the incident and claimed that it has "exposed the complete collapse of law and order in the state".Describing the incident as a "murderous attack" on Narang, he accused the ruling Congress of engineering it. Amarinder Singh was "instigating such attacks in order to stifle the voice of the BJP", Chugh alleged and demanded that the chief minister resign.SAD chief Sukhbir Singh Badal termed the "violent attack" on Narang "deplorable" and demanded an impartial inquiry to fix the responsibility for the "failure" of the police in protecting the dignity of an elected representative.He appealed to everyone to exercise restraint to ensure that peace and communal harmony in the state was not disturbed.Thousands of farmers have been protesting since late November at Delhi borders with Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, demanding a rollback of the farm laws.

The steps which yatris (pilgrims) need to follow in order to register for the yatra (pilgrimage), have been put on the board's website www.shriamarnathjishrine.com," Kumar said.He added that it also contains relevant information on how to reach the base camps, fee for registration, tariff for ponies, palanquin and porters.Kumar said people under the age of 13 years or above the age of 75 years and women who are more than six weeks pregnant would not be registered for this year's yatra as per COVID-19 norms.He said permits for the yatra would be different for each day of the week and routes.Different colour code for each day will be used to facilitate police personnel deployed at the access control gates at Baltal in Ganderbal district and Chandanwari-Pahalgam in Anantnag district to regulate the yatra for the relevant date and route, the CEO said.In this context, he cautioned pilgrims against undertaking this arduous yatra without securing a permit and the required compulsory health certificate.Kumar stressed that, for ensuring effective security arrangements along the difficult tracks, only those yatris who are in possession of a permit which is valid for a specified date and route, will be allowed to proceed beyond the base camps, and cross the entry gates.He appealed to pilgrims to complete necessary formalities for registration in advance and obtain a permit so that they do not face any inconvenience.Pilgrims who propose to travel by helicopter do not require advance registration as their tickets will suffice for this purpose, Kumar said.However, Kumar said they would be required to produce the compulsory health certificate issued by an authorised doctor in the prescribed format before they are allowed to travel by helicopter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/registration-for-amarnath-yatra-to-start-from-april-1-official-101616856029995.html

The e-filing and data which can be contained is going to take away the need for many storage rooms and many rooms which are necessary for storing papers. The SC has done its bit on issues of court infrastructure. It has devised benchmarks and frameworks for minimum standards," he said in his speech.The CJI said that the discussion on infrastructure has largely been on the quantitative part, that is on building more courtrooms."Though building more courtrooms is necessary and important, there was very little emphasis on modernising the existing courtrooms. Though the pandemic has posed a lot of problems to access to justice, it has paved the way for modernising the courtroom," he said.The CJI also stressed the need to have a new building for the Bombay High Court in Mumbai."Bombay (High Court) also needs a new building. The Bombay building was constructed for seven judges. It is now housing more than 40. It is impossible," he said.On the judiciary in Goa, an erstwhile Portuguese colony, the CJI said that thelegacy of justice in Goa spans more than four-and-a-half centuries."I am including the period before the liberation contrary to many other areas. Even though it was not part of Indian union, there was well-established system of administration or justice," the CJP said.The CJI had also presided over as a judge on the Goa bench of the high court before being promoted to the apex court."I am the only judge or one of thee few judges who sat so often at Goa. I heard remarks that Justice Bobde is a Goa judge. I am happy when I am described like this because that's when I admired Goa, its culture, natural habitat, its music and even football," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/courtrooms-to-shrink-in-future-thanks-to-technology-cji-bobde-101616843080895.html

Electoral malpractices, horse trading of elected MLAs, and when failing in both, it resorts to passing such a dictatorial bill on the strength of its majority in Parliament. This is how the Modi govt rules,” Gehlot said in a series of tweets.He said the BJP could abolish the powers of any government by bringing such laws if it loses elections in a state.“This dictatorial decision of the Modi govt should be opposed at the national level by rising above the party line,” he said.Accusing the BJP of doing a volte-face, the chief minister said the party had earlier advocated full statehood status to Delhi.“But now they have brought such law. Prime Minister advocates cooperative federalism but in reality, NDA govt is imposing decisions on state governments by enacting such laws,” he added.Speaking at a virtual programme of the state medical education department at his residence, Gehlot said those criticising the government are often branded as “anti-nationals”.“It is a matter of grave concern for us. Look at the chief election commission, income tax department, ED or the CBI. The agencies are being misused. The country has a challenge and we will have to make people understand,” he said.PTI SDA SRY||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajasthan-cm-gehlot-calls-gnctd-bill-murder-of-democracy-move-to-target-aap-101616840760924.html

The slept on rail tracks near Karmad, around 30 km from Aurangabad, due to exhaustion, when they were run over by the train early morning on May 8 last year.The district administration of Shahdol said it has recently sent a letter to the authorities in Maharashtra's Aurangabad, requesting them to give the death certificates of the deceased to their families, an official said.The family members of the deceased here said that they had applied for the death certificate before the then Sub Divisional Magistrate (SDM) of Jaisingh Nagar."However, the official said that the death certificate will be issued by the authorities where the mishap occurred," said Sunita Singh, wife of one of the deceased Rajbahor.She said that in the absence of her husband's death certificate, she is unable to get the widow pension of the state government.Chandrawati, wife of another deceased Deepak Singh, said the death certificate is required to avail the benefits of all the government-run schemes.Parvati Singh, wife of another deceased Brajesh, said she was not able to get the works related to banks done in absence of a certificate.Gajraj Singh, who lost his two sons in the incident, said the bank officials have been asking him to bring death certificates to operate the accounts of the deceased.However, Jaisingh Nagar's SDM Dileep Pandey said the death certificates will be issued by the authorities under whose jurisdiction the accident took place."We recently wrote two letters to the Aurangabad administration in this regard," he said.According to him, the district collector of Shahdol also recently talked to his Aurangabad counterpart in this regard.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/10-months-on-kin-of-migrant-workers-run-over-by-train-while-walking-home-during-lockdown-await-death-certificates-101616834682629.html

The trials of this second vaccine, Covovax, made by Serum and US vaccine development company Novavax have already begun in India this week.Covovax has been tested against the African and the UK variants of Covid-19 and has an overall efficacy of 89%, Poonawalla tweeted.Serum Institute of India, the world's largest vaccine maker by the number of doses it produces, is supplying its first vaccine Covishield, developed in collaboration with Oxford University and Astrazeneca, to India and several other countries. With the vaccination drive going on at full throttle amid no threat of scarcity of vaccines in India, the company is moving to its second vaccine project. The trials have commenced at a Pune hospital on Thursday. 'Supplied more vaccines globally than vaccinated our own people': India tells UNDelhi's Hamdard Institute of Medical Sciences and Research will also be a part of the trial, which will take place at 19 sites across the country, covering 1,140 participants.What might keep Covovax ahead in building adequate immunity against Covid-19 is the factor that it has been tested against the variant strains of the virus.According to reports, in the phase 3 trial conducted in the UK, Covovax showed an efficacy of 96 per cent against the original strain. But against the UK variant, its efficacy percentage is 86.3 while in a phase two trial conducted in South Africa, its overall efficacy dropped to 48.6 per cent.In January, Adar Poonawalla's company sought permission from the Drugs Controller General of India to start clinical trials of the second vaccine.India has so far administered 5.8 crore vaccine doses, which include both Covishield and Covaxin. From April 1, anyone above the age of 45 years will be considered eligible for vaccines. The Centre has said both the vaccines are safe after many European countries suspended the administration of the Oxford vaccine citing risks of blood clotting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/serum-institute-s-adar-poonawalla-hopes-to-launch-2nd-covid-vaccine-by-september-101616833097368.html
27-03-2021||India||Mumbai cops book owners of Dreams Mall, Sunrise Hospital for culpable homicide||The Mumbai police on Saturday booked the owners of the Dreams Mall at Bhandup and the management of Sunrise Hospital for culpable homicide not amounting to murder a day after nine Covid-19 patients, mostly elderly, were killed in a fire at the hospital.Those booked include directors of the Mall, Rakesh Wadhwan, Nikita Amitsingh Trehan, Sarang Wadhwan, Deepak Shirke, and directors of Privilege Healthcare Services Private Limited, which owns the hospital, Amitsingh Trehan, Nikita Amitsingh Trehan, Sweetie Jain.“They have been booked under sections 304 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder and 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code,” said deputy police commissioner Chaitanya Siriprolu.The fire started on the first floor of the mall on Thursday night around 11.45 pm and soon spread to the third floor, which houses the hospital. The firefighting system, including sprinklers, was not functioning.Patients died due to suffocation, the police said. Six of those killed were on ventilators.A notice for non-compliance with fire safety norms was issued to the mall in November 2020, an official said.“It is not a case of negligence. There were serious lapses in terms of safety compliance. The biggest lapse is that the mall did not have fire permission. They have also violated the terms and conditions on the basis of which the BMC had given them a part NOC (no objection certificate). That is why we have booked the owners of the mall, hospital management, and the administrator, on charges of culpable homicide not amounting to murder and are further investigating the case,” said deputy police commissioner Prashant Kadam, who is supervising the investigation.The hospital was functioning on temporary permission due to end on March 31.There were 78 patients admitted to the hospital at the time of the incident.“The hospital had obtained permission to run a nursing home on October 1, 2020. Since January 2021, the facility has been functioning as a Covid centre. The hospital is owned by Nikita Trehan and one George Putting Shery is the chief executive officer of the hospital,” a police officer said.Rakesh Wadhawan and his son Sarang are in jail in connection with the ₹6,670 crore Punjab and Maharashtra Cooperative Bank scam.Earlier, Sunrise Hospital authorities said they responded responsibly and called for an investigation to determine how the fire spread.“There was no casualty due to fire. All patients were promptly shifted to Jumbo Covid centre (and some to other private hospitals). The patients were shifted alive, but there were few patients on ventilators and extremely critical. We believe that the casualties have not occurred due to fire, but either in transit or at other hospitals. The hospital was started in exceptional circumstances of Covid last year, and was functioning with all due compliances,” the hospital said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mumbai-cops-book-owners-of-dreams-mall-sunrise-hospital-for-culpable-homicide-101616832576438.html

"We're working to understand more and hope to have full access restored as soon as possible."The government of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina did not comment if it had blocked Facebook and its messenger, but it has previously used internet shutdowns as a tool to curb the spread of protests.Facebook also said it had serious concerns about the manner in which it was being restricted in Bangladesh at a time when effective communication was necessary to tackle the coronavirus pandemic.Local hardline group Hefazat-e-Islam, meaning protection of Islam, has called for a nationwide strike on Sunday to protest the Chittagong killings. Hefazat and its supporters accuse Modi of alienating minority Muslims in India.Modi landed in Dhaka on Friday for a two-day visit, his first international trip since the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic last year, to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the nation's independence.He is due to hold formal talks with Hasina on Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/facebook-says-services-restricted-in-bangladesh-amid-pm-modi-s-visit-101616831613996.html

The state recorded 2,091 Covid-19 cases on Friday, the highest over the last six months. Only “symbolic celebrations” for Holika Dahan will be allowed on Sunday night in 11 districts including Indore and Bhopal. Seven of the state’s districts have reported 75% of the total Covid-19 cases in Madhya Pradesh.The state government also Friday announced a lockdown on Sunday in Gwalior, Ujjain, Vidisha, and Narsinghpur in view of the surge.In Bhopal, 425 Covid-19 cases were reported on Friday. Bhopal collector Avinash Lavaniya said their priority is the safety of people and they should understand this. “The lockdown will be started from 9 pm on Saturday and continue till 6 am on Monday. But there will be a ban on unnecessary gathering and movement of people on Monday.” Indore collector Manish Singh said the decision was taken for the safety of people as the virus is spreading very fast and seven people have been found to have been infected with the UK strain, which spreads faster. The Indore district has recorded 612 cases.In a tweet, ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Kailash Vijaywargiya called the restrictions on celebrations “a very objectionable decision”. “The administration should review this decision. They hurt the religious sentiments of people.” Congress leader Vinay Bakliwal echoed him. “The BJP government is hurting religious sentiments. Holika Dahan is not just a part of the celebration but a symbol of ending evil. We will do Holika Dahan and for that, we are ready to go to jail.”Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan said he was not in the favour of lockdown and urged people against gathering for Holi celebrations in large numbers. “I have to follow emergency religion to save the lives of people as positive cases are increasing every day and to contain the spread, I have to take tough decisions. I request people to celebrate festivals at their homes.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/restrictions-on-holi-celebrations-in-madhya-pradesh-as-covid-19-cases-surge-101616831377179.html

But now as the week ends, the situation in several other states worsens as Karnataka, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh have now surpassed Kerala, the state which was considered as one of the hotspots of the infection, and the one which reported the first Covid-19 case in the country in January 2020.According to the Union health ministry's Saturday data, Kerala is not even among the top six states contributing the highest number of new infections.

He was earlier arrested in 2017.Deputy police superintendent Manoj Pandey said Bhushan was arrested after they were tipped off about a meeting of smugglers and production of India made foreign liquor (IMFL). “A team raided a house belonging to one of the liquor smugglers, Anil Pandey. It arrested the five including Bhushan and Anil Pandey. Some of their associates managed to dodge the team,” he said. He added raids were on to arrest the rest of them.Manoj Pandey said Bhushan allegedly used his clout to smuggle IMFL with the help of some of his batch mates. “We have maintained a close watch on them.” He added Bhushan has told them IMFL smugglers have changed their strategies in communicating with each other. “They are now using platforms like WhatsApp and Facebook...instead of traditional voice calling... communication through social media is encrypted and cannot be traced easily.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/former-bihar-police-officer-held-for-liquor-smuggling-101616827296767.html
27-03-2021||India||Quad top security officials meet on cards to deepen defence cooperation||The four-nation Quad grouping may add a new layer of interactions at the level of top security officials to coordinate their posture and specific roles in the Indo-Pacific, a senior government official said on plans to scale up cooperation among its members.Leaders of the United States, India, Japan and Australia held their first summit-level meeting earlier this month, signalling that the four countries would continue efforts to build their four-way alliance that is often seen as an emerging bulwark against China. The March 12 summit reviewed common challenges across the Indo-Pacific - especially China’s assertive actions - but didn’t get into the details of these threats since the meeting was being held online.The challenges posed by China will be taken up by the four leaders when they hold their in-person meeting on the sidelines of the G-7 summit in the United Kingdom or at the invitation of US President Joe Biden later. An in-person meeting of the Quad foreign ministers is also expected this year.People familiar with discussions among the four countries said there were suggestions for a Quad dialogue among their top security officials who could decide on the road map for cooperation in the Indo-Pacific. This could be the umbrella group at the official level to share information and decide on the response to common challenges.So far, the four countries have mostly focused on quadrilateral dialogue led by their top diplomats and foreign ministers. News reports from Japan also indicate that the next step is going to be multi-layered cooperation among the Quad partners.“It is inevitable,” a government official said. Already, the navies of Quad plus France are exercising under the “La Perouse” banner in the Bay of Bengal from April 4 to 7 with the Indian Navy sending an attack submarine and a destroyer for the war games.Although some strategic experts underline that the Quad partners differ in their perception of threats from China and have different policies to deal with Beijing, the evolving Quad architecture is not only aimed at China and provides a democratic alternative to ASEAN, Gulf and African countries in the Indo-Pacific. Already, France and the UK have shown keen interest in the Indo-Pacific and have expressed interest in tying up with India and Australia.The 2021 East Asia Review by the Japanese defence ministry’s strategic think tank, National Institute for Defense Studies, notes that all the four countries view the Quad grouping as a hedge to prepare for an uncertain future as US-China tensions rise and Beijing takes increasingly aggressive action in the South China Sea and the Korean peninsula.With China tightening control over Hong Kong, eyeing Taiwan and threatening both Japan and the US over Senkaku Islands, India has decided to work closely with other countries at bilateral and multilateral levels as the next focus of China’s People’s Liberation Army Navy is the Indian Ocean where it is expected to deploy its warship deployments as early as 2023. Besides, India also has a land boundary dispute with China that Beijing does not appear inclined to settle and prefers to use it as a lever to unsettle and pressurise India.Discussions on steps to ensure a free, open and inclusive Indo-Pacific region are also expected to top the agenda when the Defence Policy Group of the two countries meet next. “The decision is still to be taken but scheduling a DPG at the defence secretary official level is being considered,” said a senior government official about the bilateral mechanism that was revived in 2019 after a four-year gap.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/quad-top-security-officials-meet-on-cards-to-deepen-defence-cooperation-101616826756827.html
27-03-2021||India||Bengaluru police ‘buy’ 500 kilos of drugs using fake currency from film studio||In one of the biggest drug busts this year, the Bengaluru Police on Friday arrested three men with a consignment of 500 kg marijuana worth ₹1.5 crore. The police had roped in a film studio to execute their operation.Police procured fake currencies used in movies from a studio to “purchase” 500 kg of marijuana. Stating they were initially anxious, an officer, who took part in the operation, said although the studio currencies in ₹2,000 denominations looked real, they all had the same serial number.Elaborating on the operation, Bengaluru Police Commissioner Kamal Pant told HT that officers of the Whitefield division were asked to conduct a detailed investigation as the drug supply in the area was high. “Our officers identified some peddlers, but they wanted to get to the source. So, they convinced some peddlers to introduce some undercover cops to the suppliers,” said Pant.Soon, a peddler introduced cops disguised as peddlers who could be potential “big customers”. In the first meeting, the suppliers asked the cops about the quantity of marijuana they wanted to buy. “Since our officers wanted to seize as much contraband as possible, they asked them how much they can provide. They also told them that money was not a problem, and they were ready to buy even one tonne of drugs. But the suppliers asked to show the money before going ahead with the purchase,” Pant added.The undercover cops promised to show the cash in the next meeting. Since the police department could not spare ₹1 crore and there were security concerns, they came up with a plan to approach a film studio. “We approached a film studio in Bengaluru and asked them to provide fake currency worth ₹1 crore. The currency notes looked real, but they didn’t have the legal requirements of a real note,” said an officer part of the operation.A dark brown suitcase filled with fake currency was then taken to the second meeting with the suppliers. “One of our biggest concerns was whether the suppliers would take a closer look at the notes as they all had the same serial number. But the meeting went smoothly, and they agreed to bring 500 kg of ganja (marijuana),” said the officer.Following the meetings, on Thursday, the consignment arrived in a truck in the city. A meeting was arranged on Friday morning in KR Puram in Bengaluru to hand over the drugs. “How they transported the drugs also was a revelation for us. They had created a secret compartment behind the driver’s seat and the rest of the truck was filled with other goods,” said Pant.The police convinced the suppliers to ensure that the transaction took place in a closed environment and asked the suppliers to come to a warehouse in KR Puram. Once they arrived and showed the hidden stash, police took the men and material into custody.Police arrested three men, identified as Dayal Ram, 38, Poona Ram, 24, and Budha Ram, 23 -- all residents of Rajasthan. The commissioner added that they are on the lookout for other associates of these men.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengaluru-police-buy-rs-500-kgs-of-drugs-using-fake-currency-from-film-studio-101616825437102.html

PM Modi, who is on a two-day visit to the neighbouring country, was seen wearing a mark as he was welcomed in the temple, which was renovated on the occasion of PM Modi's visit. He also offered a hand-made, gold-plated silver crown to the goddess.Watch: PM Modi prays at Bangladesh temples, visits Bangabandhu mausoleumIshwaripur village in Shyamnagar upazila of Satkhira border West Bengal. PM said during fairs, many people visit the temple from across the border too. That's why a community centre is needed, which can double as a shelter home during an emergency, like a cyclone. "A number of devotees come here during Kaali Puja. So a multi-purpose community hall is needed here, which can become a shelter house during any disaster, especially cyclone. The Indian government will construct a community hall here. I express my gratitude to the Bangladesh government that it has also wished us well for this work," PM Modi said.He said he prayed for a coronavirus-free world as India believes that the world is a family (Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam)."Ahead of Chaitra Navratri, I got the opportunity to visit one of the 51 shakipeeths. When I came to Bangladesh in 2015, I offered my prayers to Maa Dhakeshwari. Today, I was fortunate enough to bow my head before Maa Kali," PM Modi said, adding that he wished to visit all the shaktipeeths if he gets the chance. According to Hindu mythology, the Jeshoreshwari Kali temple is one of the 51 Shakti Peeths — the 51 sacred sites where goddess Sati's 51 body parts were believed to have fallen. The shaktipeeths are spread across India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Pakistan, China and Sri Lanka.On Saturday, PM Modi is also scheduled to visit Gopalganj's Orakandi temple."I am particularly looking forward to my interaction with representatives of the Matua community at Orakandi, from where Sri Sri Harichandra Thakur ji disseminated his pious message," Prime Minister Modi had said in a statement on Thursday.Then, he will also visit the 'Mausoleum of Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman' in Tungipara of Gopalganj.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/wish-to-visit-all-51-shaktipeeths-pm-modi-at-bangladesh-s-jeshoreshwari-kali-temple-101616822278229.html

The state health department has also cautioned against the possible congregation of lawyers during elections to Bar associations on Saturday. Additional chief secretary Pradipta Kumar Mohapatra has written to all the district collectors, police chiefs and municipal commissioners and asked them to enforce the Covid-19 norms and prevent congregations during campaign and polls. The health department is also all set to roll out a plan of vaccinating a minimum of 10 million people, or around 25% of the total population. The state would also vaccinate all utility service providers.Mohapatra said over two million vaccinations have been carried out till Thursday. He added they plan to vaccinate 15,00,00 people daily. He added Odisha has informed the Centre that the “insufficient and erratic” supply of the Covid-19 vaccines was hampering the vaccination programme.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-bans-congregations-amid-a-surge-in-covid-19-cases-101616822616408.html
27-03-2021||India||'Supplied more vaccines globally than vaccinated our own people': India tells UN||India has supplied more Covid-19 vaccines globally than vaccinated its own people, the country has told the UN General Assembly and cautioned that vaccine inequity will defeat the collective global resolve to contain the coronavirus as the disparity in the accessibility of vaccines will affect the poorest nations the most.India was one of the initiators of the ‘Political Declaration on Equitable Global Access to COVID-19 Vaccines’ that garnered the support of more than 180 UN member states.Follow latest updates on Covid-19 here India’s deputy rermanent representative to the UN Ambassador K. Nagaraj Naidu said at the General Assembly informal meeting on Friday that while the Covid-19 pandemic continues to persist, the year 2021 began on a positive note with the global scientific community coming up with multiple vaccines to contain the pandemic.“While the vaccine challenge has been resolved, we are now confronted with ensuring the availability, accessibility, affordability, and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines. Lack of global cooperation and disparity in the accessibility of vaccines will affect the poorest nations the most,” Naidu said.India has been at the forefront of the global fight against Covid-19. Naidu told the General Assembly that India will not only be vaccinating 300 million of its own frontline workers over the next six months but in the process has also supplied vaccines to over 70 nations."In fact, as of today we have supplied more vaccines globally than have vaccinated our own people,” Naidu said.Two of India’s vaccines, including the indigenously developed Covaxin, have already been granted emergency authorization, Naidu said, adding that 30 more vaccine candidates are at various phases of clinical trials.The vaccine Covishield is the version of the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine produced by the Serum Institute of India. Covaxin is the indigenously developed vaccine by pharma company Bharat Biotech.The Political Declaration states that equitable and affordable access to safe and effective Covid-19 vaccines must be ensured to have a speedy recovery and contribute to putting an end to the pandemic.The declaration also expresses deep concern that despite international agreements and initiatives, the distribution of Covid-19 vaccines is still uneven worldwide, both among and within countries.“Therefore, we express our deep concern that a considerable number of countries have not yet had access to COVID-19 vaccines, and stress the need for global solidarity and multilateral cooperation to increase vaccine production and distribution, on regional and global levels.”Naidu said that as highlighted by the declaration equity in access to the vaccine is important for mitigating the impact of the pandemic.“Vaccine inequity will defeat our collective resolve to contain the virus. The current disparity calls for solidarity and cooperation within the international frameworks such as COVAX,” he said.India, a significant source of supply to Gavi’s COVAX facility, has contributed 20 million doses to the facility last month. India had also announced a gift of 200,000 Covid-19 vaccine doses for UN peacekeepers.The shipment of vaccines for peacekeepers left Mumbai in the early hours of Saturday and will land in Denmark soon, Naidu said.India also underlined the need to collaborate on genomic surveillance to track virus mutations and variants and exchange information in a timely fashion.“Vaccine hesitancy should also be countered with science and public health infrastructure and capacities of health workers in vaccine delivery needs to be strengthened globally,” he said.Naidu highlighted the need for the international community to collectively work towards supporting initiatives that ensure speedy and equitable distribution of vaccines and therapeutics to the most disadvantaged populations.“Affordability, access, and logistical issues should in no way become a hindrance in our fight against one of the biggest challenges facing humanity,” he said.Naidu added that India is working actively with GAVI, the World Health Organisation and ACT Accelerator.“India and South-Africa have also called for WTO (World Trade Organisation) to suspend intellectual property rights related to COVID-19 for a limited period of time, to ensure rapid scaling-up of manufacturing of vaccines and ensuring accessibility and affordability of vaccines for all,” he said.He also stressed the importance of ensuring that ongoing global immunisation programmes pertaining to polio, diphtheria and other diseases do not get impacted as that will lead to the resurgence of other deadly diseases.World Health Organisation chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has called for countries to work together so that all States could begin vaccinating within the first 100 days of 2021. He said 177 countries and economies have started vaccination and added that with just 15 days left before the 100 days are up, 36 countries are still waiting for vaccines so they can start inoculating health workers and older people.President of the 75th session of the UN General Assembly Volkan Bozkir said at the meeting that the world, which went into the Covid-19 pandemic together, can emerge from it together as well.“But that depends on fair and equitable access to vaccines. From the health worker in a small island developing state, to a teacher in a refugee camp, to the elderly in care facilities across our countries, we must all be covered,” Bozkir said.He stressed that the most vulnerable groups – people on the move, in conflict zones, and those already marginalised – must be prioritised.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supplied-more-vaccines-globally-than-vaccinated-our-own-people-india-tells-un-101616820647628.html
27-03-2021||India||Across borders, the turbulent journey of South Asia’s Matua community||A small hamlet in Bangladesh’s Gopalganj district is an unlikely destination for a sitting Indian Prime Minister. But the town of Orakandi is not just the birthplace of 19th century anti-caste reformist Harichand Thakur; it is the nerve centre of the nearly 10 million Matuas in the Muslim-majority nation, and roughly 35 million in India.The Orakandi thakurbari is maintained by the Bangladesh Matua Mahasangha. Its counterpart in India is housed in Thakurnagar in the North 24 parganas district of West Bengal – the twin bodies mirroring the pangs of Partition that devastated the anti-caste sect and forced millions of followers to flee to India over two decades.“After Partition, we faced many ignominies. Our ashrams were taken our and hostels closed. For almost 20 years, the movement went underground because of fundamentalists, and could revive itself only by 1970s,” said Sagar Sadhu Thakur, the secretary general of the Mahasangha.The visit comes in the backdrop of the West Bengal assembly elections where the Matuas – most of whose members hail from the scheduled caste Namashudra community – control the fate of around 30 seats. But it is also a big moment for the Bangladesh Mahasangha, which now has expanded to 50 of the country’s districts, and are one of the largest minority communities in Bangladesh.“We are grateful and happy that the Indian prime minister has accorded us the respect of a visit. We hope that he will accord the same support to our Indian brethren,” said Sagar Thakur. Subrata Thakur, the president of the body, said the organisation had put a fresh coat of paint on the temple and welcomed the PM.Born in a peasant family in 1812, Harichand Thakur quickly gained a following in erstwhile-undivided Bengal among the lower-castes as he formed edicts for salvation of the community.His couplets in Bengali stressed on education and strong organisation as the primary modes of community empowerment. Every second couplet spoke about the importance of brotherhood and ending discrimination – similar to the teachings of other anti-caste icons such as Dr BR Ambedkar a century later. Key to the Matua sect’s working are his 12 edicts, primary among which is an order to abstain from discriminating against anyone, even animals.“Harichand Thakur’s main aim was to unite the untouchables and the oppressed for a common cause of collective thought, and that is where the key to the liberation of spirituality lies. He wanted to establish a classless, casteless society,” said Biplab Biswas and Bipul Mandal, researchers from north Bengal. The sect has its own rituals, worshipped the Thakurs, and built a spiritual life that revolved around the 12 teachings.Harichand’s son, Guruchand Thakur, consolidated the organisation, built groups of disciples who spread the message of anti-discrimination in villages, and established the first school for the Namashudra community in 1881 with the help of Australian clergyman CS Mead. He also lobbied the British government to provide quotas for the Namashudra community.These gains were undone by Partition and the death of Guruchand in 1937. With communalism rising and unprecedented rioting across Bengal, the Matuas were split. One section, led by Guruchand’s grandson PR Thakur, aligned with the Congress party, moved to India and established Thakurnagar.The other was led by Jogendranath Mandal, a key ally of Ambedkar and among the first alumni of the Namashudra school. Mandal saw that a majority of Matuas were in erstwhile east Pakistan and urged Dalit-Muslim to unite — people both faiths were peasants in the region — against the upper-caste elite. He became Pakistan’s first law minister, but a spate of riots against Matuas and other religious minorities in 1950 forced him to resign. He died in exile in India in 1968.This was a period of intense difficulty for the Matuas. “Islamic nationalism gained in strength after the death of Jinnah and there was concerted pressure on Dalit peasants to migrate. The Indian government, too, didn’t treat them well,” said Sekhar Bandyopadhyay, professor of history at the Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand.In Bangladesh, too, the movement went underground as its buildings were looted and taken over, including their most important ashram in Khulna.In 1972, Himangshupati Thakur, a descendant of Harichand Thakur, started to revive the movement. Nine years later, the sect organised their mahasammelan, or mega congregation. Today, the body organizes four major celebrations across the country that is attended by millions of people. But problems with fundamentalism remain. “Our buildings were burnt down. We have still not been able to get back possession of many spots, despite legal proceedings,” said Sagar Thakur.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/across-borders-the-turbulent-journey-of-south-asia-s-matua-community-101616821296516.html

He was on his way home to Viman Nagar after finishing the fire fighting work at Fashion Street which was completely gutted.PCB CEO Amit Kumar said “He called me around 2 am and briefed me that the fire was under control. He left the spot very late towards Viman Nagar.After that there was no information. His son became anxious and called saying that Hasabe did not return. He then received a call from some people who told him that his father had an accident and they were taking him to Sahyadri hospital . It’s a tragic incident which took place early morning.”Fashion Street adjacent to MG Road is a famous destination that houses small outlets selling garments, shoes, goggles and other accessories. Local traders said there were 448 registered shops and over 200 unauthorised outlets located in the market.It took the fire brigade six hours and 45 fire engines to douse the blaze completely. The cause of the fire was being ascertained, officials said.Even though the market was shut when the blaze started, the fire brigade had a tough time negotiating the narrow lanes, which were encroached and had vehicles haphazardly parked. Precious time was lost in all this, said officials.Fire brigade chief Prashant Ranpise said, “The reason behind the fire could not be ascertained. A large crowd at spot and water shortage also led to delay in fighting the blaze. The fire raged as there was a huge stock of clothes and footwear. “The fire department received a call at 11 pm and rushed a few fire engines to the spot. But as the fire spread rapidly as the small shops were stacked with clothes, more fire engines had to be sent.According to Pune Cantonment Board, a report was submitted in 2018 highlighting the “risk” of similar incidents and possible difficulty to deal with it at Fashion Street due to congested nature of the area.The joint fire audit report submitted by the Chief Fire Officer, Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) and the Fire Brigade Superintendent of PCB was discussed at the special board meeting held in 2018 under the chairmanship of the then PCB President Brigadier Rajiv Sethi. The audit report says the market does not have sufficient exit points in case there is a fire and people have to be evacuated.“It is a very serious matter in respect to the Fashion Street report submitted by the fire department of PMC. Fashion Street has become a risky place for fire incidents. We will be collecting information about owners of all the stalls and take action against any illegal stalls,” Brigadier Rajiv Sethi had stated on record.In 1997, unauthorised vendors were evicted from MG Road and the administration provided these hawkers stalls of five feet by four feet in Fashion Street. A total of 565 shops came under the agreement.The report pointed out that many shopkeepers used plastic curtains as partitions which are hazardous in the event of a fire and the narrow streets inside make it difficult to move. There are stalls outside the market serving as cafeterias or hotels and use fuels like LPG and kerosene, the report stated.During a verification drive, the revenue staff of PCB found out that the place is not safe in the event of a fire. It was also pointed out that it would be difficult for a fire engine or ambulance to reach due to narrow and congested streets.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/massive-blaze-guts-500-shops-in-pune-fireman-dies-in-road-accident-101616819916621.html

In his police complaint, the man’s father said his son was returning from a temple when four men tortured him. Police superintendent Anand Sharma said the attackers abducted the man, took him to a secluded place, tied his hands and feet, and thrashed him with batons. “The accused allegedly forced the victim to drink urine.

27-03-2021||India||Madhya Pradesh imposes Sunday curfew in 5 more districts as Covid-19 cases rise||The Madhya Pradesh government has decided to extend Sunday lockdown to five more districts as the state grapples with a spike in its daily news cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), Live Hindustan, Hindustan Times’ sister publication has reported.The state government has decided to impose Sunday lockdown in Vidisha, Ujjain, Gwalior, Narsinghpur and Sausar, an official from the Madhya Pradesh information department told Live Hindustan. “The decision to this effect was taken in a high-level meeting chaired by chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan on Friday,” the official said.The announcement means that Sunday lockdown will now be in effect in 12 districts of the central state. The government had first announced such a lockdown for Indore, Bhopal and Jabalpur and, later, extended it to Khargone, Betul, Chhindwara and Ratlam. In fact, for Indore and Bhopal, a night curfew was announced earlier this month.Also Read | Madhya Pradesh announces night curfew in Bhopal & Indore as Covid-19 cases riseThe official further quoted CM Chouhan as saying that the state government has devised a three-fold strategy to curb the spread of the pandemic. This includes testing people, ensuring better treatment for those found positive, and conducting vaccinations at a rapid pace across the state.On Friday, 2,091 people tested positive for Covid-19 in Madhya Pradesh, the highest single-day rise for the state in 2021, while nine more lives were lost to the viral infection. With this, the infection tally has risen to 284,265, while the death toll stands at 3,937. Of these, Indore, Bhopal and Jabalpur saw 612, 425 and 156 fresh cases respectively.Together, Indore and Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh’s financial and legislative capitals, respectively, contribute more than 50% of the state’s overall Covid-19 caseload.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/madhya-pradesh-imposes-sunday-curfew-in-5-more-districts-as-covid-19-cases-rise-101616813473122.html
27-03-2021||India||Maharashtra adds over 1.8 lakh new Covid cases in 6 days, night curfew from tomorrow | 10 points||In the last six days, Maharashtra, the state worst hit by the Covid-19 pandemic, added over 1.8 lakh fresh infections to the caseload of the state, while 608 people have lost their lives due to Covid-19 from all across the state. This week has been significant in Maharashtra's battle against the pandemic as a year after it started, the state recorded the highest-ever daily spike, necessitating statewide night curfew which will be imposed from March 28.Here are 10 developments of the Maharashtra Covid-19 situation that took place between March 21 and March 26> On March 24, the state reported a record high in the number of cases with 31,855 fresh infections. The new record was then left behind and in the next two days, the state reported new highs.> In the last six days, Mumbai reported 26,765 new infections and 57 deaths. For Mumbai too, this week was the most crucial as after a year of its continuous battle against the pandemic, it reported a record high of 5,190 daily cases on March 24.> Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray has instructed district administrations to impose night curfew from 8pm to 7am across the state. This makes Maharashtra as the first state to announce any state-wide restriction a year after the nationwide lockdown was imposed on March 25, 2020. Several districts of the state were under restrictions. Other states too have imposed district-specific restrictions.> At present, Maharashtra has 2,82,451 active Covid-19 cases.> Nine out of 10 districts with the highest number of active cases in the country are in Maharashtra. Pune has the highest number of active cases — 50,240, according to Union health ministry data on Friday.> Almost all districts in the last six days reported their highest single-day addition. Nashik on Friday recorded 4,099 new cases. Nagpur, which is under lockdown, reported its highest single-day spike of 4,095 cases on Friday.> No celebrations on the occasion of Holi, Good Friday, Easter is allowed in the state.> Nagpur, Nanded, Beed, Parbhani districts are already under lockdown. Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar warned on Friday that if the Covid-19 situation in Pune remains the same, then lockdown is possible. On Friday, the district of Pune reported 7,090 Covid-19 cases. Out of these, Pune city accounted for 3,594 cases.> The Union health ministry has said the situation in Maharashtra is of grave concern. The state has also reported a double mutant strain of the virus in Nagpur, but this has not been correlated with the spike. Availability of a pool of susceptible population, meaning a large number of people who lowered their guard in the past few months in the state, is being seen as the reason behind the spike.> The government is ramping up the vaccination and testing numbers as imposing lockdown is not a solution. Mumbai civic body started random rapid antigen testing in crowded areas of the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-added-over-1-8-lakh-new-covid-cases-in-6-days-night-curfew-from-sunday-10-points-101616811735328.html
27-03-2021||India||In Mumbai, an explosive scare, a murder, and now – a political crisis||Why did suspended police officer Sachin Vaze place 20 loose gelatin sticks in a duffle bag with a Mumbai Indian logo, inside a green-coloured Scorpio and park it outside Antilia, home to one of the richest Indians, on Carmichael Road in south Mumbai?According to the National Investigation Agency (NIA), which took over the probe on March 9 after the Union home ministry took suo moto cognizance of the explosives case, Vaze did this to regain his lost glory. A top NIA official told Hindustan Times on condition of anonymity that Vaze, who was at the time of the discovery heading the Crime Intelligence Unit (CIU) of the Crime Branch, “wanted to prove to Mumbai Police brass that he is still as good, by solving a bomb conspiracy.”The official said that Vaze planned the whole episode to plant explosives outside Antilia. “He wanted the limelight again,” he said.Vaze has a chequered history, no doubt. He was arrested and suspended in 2004, in connection with the alleged custodial killing of a terror suspect named Khwaja Yunus. In 2007, he left the force, and joined the Shiv Sena shortly afterwards. In the meantime, he started dealerships in partnership and security services. Vaze was only reinstated in 2020, after an alliance of the Shiv Sena, Nationalist Congress Party, and the Congress (the MVA or Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi) came to power. And he tripped up, NIA officials contended, because of his overconfidence.Vaze was the lead investigator in the explosives case when it first came to light. It was later transferred to the Maharashtra Anti Terrorism Squad (ATS), before the NIA took over.Vaze however has refuted this theory and maintains his innocence. On March 25, Vaze told the special NIA court which was hearing a plea to extend his custody, “I was Investigating Officer for one and a half days and I did what was required to investigate the case. Not only I but all Crime Branch and Mumbai police officers did so.”“But suddenly something changed and when I went to NIA on March 13, I was put under the arrest by NIA officials,” he said.The previous day, the central agency invoked sections of the stringent Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA), an anti-terror law, against the suspended cop. NIA used sections 16 and 18 of the anti-terror law claiming that an individual/or group of persons planning such a conspiracy can be booked under terror charges. The two sections deal with conspiring to commit a terror act.The court granted custody to NIA, but for 15 days instead of 30 as permitted under the UAPA.Which brings us back to the question posed at the beginning: why did Vaze plant the explosives, as the NIA contends? That’s one part of this saga, and much of it depends on what the NIA investigation and the ensuing court case will no doubt reveal.But there are two more parts to this story which are inextricably linked to the green-coloured Scorpio that turned up outside Antilia, on Carmichael Road on February 25. It involves the likely murder of an auto parts dealer, and a fast-developing political crisis that the coalition government at the helm in Maharashtra finds itself in.To use a popular millennial phrase, that escalated quickly.First, the murder… A Thane-based auto parts dealer named Mansukh Hiran who had been driving the Scorpio for three years, having taken it from its owner, a certain Peter Newton in lieu of a defaulted payment, turned up dead 10 days after the his body washed up ashore a creek in Mumbra; it turned out that Vaze not only knew Hiran well, he had also borrowed the car from him for four months, and returned it on February 5. On February 17, at around 6.30pm, Hiran took the vehicle heading towards south Mumbai, the statement read. However, its steering was not smooth which prompted Hiran to park the car on the side of the road, and continue his journey in a taxi.At around 8.25pm, at Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (CSTM), close to the CIU office, Hiran met Vaze. A CCTV grab from the area showed Hiran sit in Vaze’s car – a black Mercedes – and get out of it after 10 minutes. NIA officials believe that Hiran handed over the keys of the Scorpio to Vaze during this time.The following day, Hiran filed a stolen car report in Vikhroli. His wife told the ATS, that Hiran had taken a mechanic on February 18 to bring the vehicle back to his shop. However, finding the car “stolen”, he lodged a complaint with Vikhroli police station.NIA officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that after interrogating Vaze — it began on March 13 itself, when NIA officials in Mumbai called him in for questioning in the morning, and arrested him 10 minutes before midnight — and speaking to several Mumbai Police officers and witnesses, as well as on analysing technical evidence, they have managed to piece together the sequence of events behind the case that has caught the nation’s attention.Sharing details, one NIA officer said, “As part of his plan to produce a sensational case in Mumbai and then solve it in record time, the arrested assistant police inspector, who was in charge of the Crime Intelligence Unit (CIU), asked businessman Mansukh Hiran to leave his Scorpio on the highway on February 17.”“Hiran, after leaving the car on Mulund-Airoli Road, met Vaze near Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus the same day, and handed over the keys as asked by the officer. Vaze then asked Hiran to lodge a complaint (of a missing car) with the police, which Hiran filed on February 18,” the first officer said.From February 17 till February 25, the Scorpio was with Vaze and his associates in CIU, investigations revealed.On February 25, a second NIA investigator said, Vaze and a constable of CIU went in a convoy of two cars — the Scorpio and an Innova — to Carmichael Road around 2:20am to drop the Scorpio, laden with gelatin sticks, near Ambani’s residence, Antilia. A threat letter, addressed to Ambani and his wife, had already been placed beforehand in the vehicle. “Vaze and the constable took turns to drive Scorpio and then they returned in the Innova,” the officer said.“But, around 4.30am, Vaze returned to the spot to check the Scorpio as he thought he had left his identity card in it by mistake,” the second officer added. This visit, NIA officials said, has been established by CCTV footage from Mulund toll naka, where the Innova can be seen re-entering Mumbai from Thane around 4 am after leaving the city about half-an-hour earlier.A CCTV grab showing a man in a white kurta walking to the Scorpio prompted the NIA officials to take Vaze to the site, and make him walk to analyse his gait, and compare it to the person in the grab. They also raided his office in CIU, after his arrest, and seized a laptop, an iPad, a phone, and documents among other material. They also seized the black Mercedes that Vaze and Hiran sat in. In all, six vehicles have been seized by the NIA, including the Innova, which was a police vehicle.NIA officials said the agency will likely make the constable, whom they did not name, a witness rather than charge him in conspiracy. They added that the constable has confirmed the role of Vaze in the conspiracy.Once he was made the investigating officer of the case, Vaze asked Hiran to take the rap, but the latter demurred, said a third NIA officer.NIA officials believe that Vaze’s plan was to create some link between Hiran (once he confessed) and some Pakistani terror group or suspect, to make it look like a conspiracy planned by Pakistan’s spy agency Inter Services Intelligence. The officials admitted that this remains a theory that is yet to be proved.On March 5, Hiran’s body was found by fishermen at the Reti Bunder creek in Thane district, around 10.30am. The Mumbra Police handed over the body to the Chhatrapati Shivaji Hospital in Kalwa and filed an Accidental Death report. Prima facie, the police said, it seemed that Hiran had died by suicide. But Vimla, Hiran’s wife contested that claim. In a statement to the ATS, which took charge of the murder probe, she said that Hiran was too good a swimmer to have drowned. Besides, the body had no identifying markers on it: his wallet, gold chain, gold ring studded with a pukhraj stone and wrist watch were not found on him when his body was recovered. What’s more, his body was found in a creek at Mumbra with handkerchiefs stuffed into his mouth, which was also covered by a scarf.On March 4, Vimala said that her husband returned from his shop at 8.30pm and told her that he was going to meet a police officer named Tawade, somewhere along Ghodbunder Road.Vimala told the investigating team that when she tried calling her husband at 11pm, his mobile phone was switched off. Later at night, her son spoke to Hiran’s brother, Vinod to inform him that Hiran had not returned home. Vinod called Vaze, who reportedly expressed surprise at the meeting and informed Vinod that Hiran had not mentioned that he was going to meet Tawde.The following morning, Hiran’s family lodged a missing person’s report at Naupada police station. The report filed helped identify the body.On March 7, an ATS team questioned the family for over three hours and filed an FIR against unknown persons for the murder of Mansukh Hiran.“Taking into consideration all the above circumstances, I am sure that my husband was murdered,” the last few lines of Vimla’s statement read. “I suspect Sachin Vaze could have committed the said murder.”Further investigation by the ATS revealed that two people were involved in Hiran’s murder: an ex cop called Vinayak Shinde, and a bookie named Naresh Gor.Preliminary investigation found that some SIM cards used in commission of the crime were obtained by an employee of Gor, who runs a card club and also accepts betting on Cricket matches in Mumbai. The SIM cards were obtained from a Gujrat based person known to him and were found to be obtained in the name of a company from Gujrat. Preliminary investigation also revealed that the SIM cards were handed over by the bookie, Naresh Ramaniklal Gor, to Vinayak Shinde.It was Shinde who called Hiran on March 4, pretending to be a cop called Tawde, the ATS investigators found. At least 14 SIM cards procured by Gor from a contact in Gujarat were activated and used in the commission of this crime, the ATS said. Some of the mobile handsets in which those SIM cards were used were destroyed by the accused. A Volvo, belonging to Vaze’s former business associate, Abhishek Agarwal, was seized from Daman; the ATS believe it may have been the vehicle in which Hiran spent his last few hours.It is as yet unclear whether Hiran was made unconscious and then pushed into the creek, where he drowned. A Diatoms test – which checks for the presence of a single-celled algae called diatoms, to indicate whether a person has drowned – was performed on the body. Its results have been sent to a forensic science laboratory in Haryana for confirmation.However, Vaze was the mastermind of this murder the ATS said in a press conference that the chief held a day before the case was transferred to the NIA.The Union home ministry passed an order transferring the case to the federal agency, since the cases were linked; the NIA now has custody of the two accused of murdering Hiran, and have begun actively investigating the death.… And then, a political crisis… The second related part to this story is a study on the snowball effect: within days of Vimla’s statement to the ATS, the leader of the Opposition in Maharashtra, Devendra Fadnavis, demanded a probe by the NIA into the explosives as well as into Vaze’s role in the murder.Vaze was first transferred. He was also questioned by the ATS. Then, on March 13, as stated above, he was called in to the NIA team’s Mumbai office. He wasn’t the only CIU officer called in that day. Others who had also actively investigated the crime in its initial days were asked to come in too. But after 12 hours of questioning, he was the only one arrested.The home minister, who was under attack from Opposition for the shoddy handling of the case, transferred the Mumbai police commissioner, Param Bir Singh, the following week. In a media event the following day, he said that Singh’s transfer wasn’t routine, but due to grievous errors committed by his colleagues.A few days later, Param Bir Singh, who had taken charge of Home Guards, Maharashtra, wrote a letter to the CM, and marked other senior politicians and bureaucrats. He accused the home minister, Anil Deshmukh, of running an extortion ring. Deshmukh had set Vaze, and a few other cops, a target of collecting ₹100 crore, most of it from establishments like hookah bars and restaurants, the unsigned letter stated.Singh said that he was “made a scapegoat to divert attention from the actual wrongdoers”.Deshmukh, however, refuted the allegations raised by Singh. “Sachin Vaze’s direct links in Antilia Case and Mansukh Hiren case are coming forward. Param Bir Singh is afraid that its connections will reach up to him. He has made these false allegations to save and protect himself from legal action,” the home minister tweeted immediately. Later, he issued a statement expanding on his innocence.The letter led to fresh demands by the Opposition party, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), calling for Deshmukh’s sacking. The Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) coalition government rallied around Deshmukh, and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar held press conferences on two consecutive days poking holes in allegations made by BJP leaders, including Fadnavis, based on the letter’s contents.NCP Maharashtra president Jayant Patil said there was no question of replacing home minister Anil Deshmukh and asserted, “The letter is a reaction after Maharashtra chief minister and home minister decided to take a tough stand,” the state minister said. “If we ask Deshmukh to resign now, we would be doing what certain people want,” he told HT.The Congress, which is part of the MVA coalition, along with NCP and Shiv Sena, also said that Deshmukh mustn’t resign, but demanded that a probe be ordered into the so-called extortion ring.A few days later, Singh moved the Bombay HC through a Public Interest Litigation, seeking a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) probe into Deshmukh’s alleged dealings.…Which just keeps growing… Singh’s letter also made a reference to another report, this one submitted last August to the additional chief secretary (Home), a post that was held by current Chief Secretary Sitaram Kunte at the time. The report was put together by former Commissioner of Intelligence Rashmi Shukla and pertained to an alleged money for transfer scam in the police department. Shukla submitted the report to the then Director General of Police Subodh Jaiswal, who in turn forwarded it to Kunte on August 26, 2020. In the covering letter Jaiswal wrote: “It is a serious matter and necessitates urgent action by the state government. It is recommended that this be brought to the notice of Hon. Chief Minister at the earliest and an immediate and comprehensive enquiry by State CID (Crime), Pune be ordered to identify concerned individuals and take necessary legal action.”The report, which is based on intercepted phone calls of six people, states that they were middlemen who helped police officials seek postings of their choice, and brought up the names of politicians like NCP chief Sharad Pawar, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar and home minister Anil Deshmukh, in their conversations.The report does not state that the middlemen spoke to these leaders directly but to politicians’ aides and policemen. The report states that one the middlemen is an assistant in the home minister’s office. The report also does not talk about any direct transfer of money to these politicians. It does however refer to “monetary exchange” between police officers and middlemen acting in close connection with politicians.HT has seen a copy of the report, and Shukla, who is currently on deputation with the Central Reserve Police Force, has not responded to repeated calls and text messages.Kunte submitted a five-page brief to Thackeray on March 25, detailing out what exactly happened regarding these phone interceptions.Kunte’s report – HT has seen a copy of it – stated that Shukla intercepted the calls under the guise of “public safety” and thus “misguided the authorities”. It further stated that no transfers of police officials took place between June 27 and September 1, 2020 – the period in which the calls were intercepted, and thus no scam had occurred.As things stand, the MVA government is mulling over taking action against Shukla, if it is discovered that she leaked the official report. Fadnavis claimed that he had the call record details of what Shukla intercepted, and he has asked Union home secretary to advise on whether a CBI probe in this matter can be instituted. However, in his note, Kunte said that no such pen drive of intercepted calls was submitted along with the report.The state has also decided to institute a judicial commission, led by a retired judge, to probe the allegations against Deshmukh made in Singh’s letter.Meanwhile, Vaze remains in custody of the NIA, which has started probing Hiran’s murder. On Thursday night, they took Vaze to a spot about a kilometer ahead of where Hiran’s body was found. Then, they drove him to another spot in Thane, where Hiran had reportedly been lured to by Shinde. On Friday, the NIA also put all three accused in the Hiran murder case in the same room.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-mumbai-an-explosive-scare-a-murder-and-now-a-political-crisis-101616812356080.html
27-03-2021||India||The CR Park state of mind||The men look carefree, playing cards by the pavement. The vegetable seller is napping by his cart. A balloon hawker is slowly dragging his bicycle and the helium balloons, tied to the handle bar, are bobbing in the air. A woman walks past purposefully, wearing her sari in the Bengali style.Strolling in south Delhi’s CR Park’s main avenue instantly transports you to an upscale Kolkata neighbourhood. More intense is the neighbourhood’s gentle rhythm. Everything feels unhurried, like ripples spreading slowly through a pond, whose water surface patiently absorbs all minor disturbances.A part of the road is lined with bungalows, each with its distinct individuality, as if harbouring its own Netflix series. Some of these houses are dated enough to exhibit an old-fashioned architecture—simple balconies and windows, with a small porch. These were a common sight in many Delhi neighbourhoods, but most such houses have been replaced by swish apartment complexes, or modern bungalows with designs so universal that they belong to every place and to no place in particular. CR Park still has a few of these well-maintained relics.No walk here will be fulfilling without a diversion into the so-called Market no. 1. Apart from its famous fish stalls, it has a carrom board club, a chai shop with a little temple fixed to the wall, and an establishment with a name that pulsates with history—East Bengal Halal & Mutton Chicken shop, with the Indian flag painted on the banner. Also check out Apsara Blouse, a shop decked with dozens of sari blouses of all shades.The road ahead passes by a public park and lunch stalls, with the tables set on the footpath, like in a European city. This afternoon though the biggest crowd is in front of the Kolkata Special Jhalmuri Stall (yummy!).Across the road, in one of the houses, a woman is standing in her balcony; her hair, white and long, is flowing picturesquely in the breeze.The walk ends at Kali Mandir. A masked woman is sitting by a banner printed with the temple’s Covid-era instructions of “no prasad, no shanti jal, no vermillion, no bhog, no offering and no meditation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/the-cr-park-state-of-mind-101616810141213.html

I must have been 20-22 years old when many of my colleagues and I joined a satyagraha for the freedom of the people of Bangladesh,” he said.“I was arrested and had to go to jail. The yearning for Bangladesh’s independence was as great on this side as it was on the other side,” he said, speaking as a guest of honour at the main National Day celebration in Dhaka while sharing the stage with his Bangladeshi counterpart Sheikh Hasina.In a speech in Hindi peppered with Bengali words, Modi – clad in a black sleeveless jacket in a style made popular by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the Father of the Nation of Bangladesh – made several references to the sacrifices made by Indian soldiers and Bangladeshi freedom fighters in the 1971 war that led to the emergence of a new country from the erstwhile East Pakistan.Recalling the words of former prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, who had said the blood of Bangladeshi freedom fighters and Indian soldiers would build relations that won’t break under any pressure, Modi said the next 25 years will be crucial for India and Bangladesh. “Just as our heritage, development and goals are shared, our challenges too are shared. We have to remember that while there are opportunities for us in trade and industry, there are shared threats like terrorism. The ideology and powers that carry out such inhuman acts are still active,” he said.“We must be careful and be organised to fight them. We both have the power of democracy and a clear vision to move forward,” he added.Modi also recalled the role played by the Pakistani military in triggering the uprising that led to the creation of Bangladesh. “The images of the heinous crimes and atrocities committed by the Pakistan Army did not allow people to sleep for many days,” he said.He quoted Bengali poet Gobinda Halder to say that those who liberated Bangladesh with an ocean of blood will never be forgotten, especially against the backdrop of the Pakistan Army’s efforts to crush the language, voice and identity of the people.Amidst all this, Rahman, or “Bongobandhu” as he is popularly known, was a ray of hope for Bangladeshis and Indians alike, Modi said. He also paid tribute to others such as former prime minister Indira Gandhi, Field Marshal Sam Manekshaw, Lt Gen JS Aurora and Lt Gen JFR Jacob for their role in the liberation of Bangladesh.He said the current governments of the two countries have shown that mutual trust and cooperation can lead to the solution of complex problems, such as the land boundary agreement, and close collaboration to cope with contingencies such as the pandemic.Bangladesh rolled out the red carpet for Modi as he began a two-day visit on Friday, with Hasina and members of her cabinet welcoming the Prime Minister at Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport. Modi was accorded a 19-gun salute and a guard of honour.Soon after his arrival, Modi visited Jatiyo Sriti Shoudho or National Martyrs’ Memorial, which honours those who died in Bangladesh’s liberation war.Later, Modi met community leaders, including representatives of Bangladesh’s minorities, freedom fighters and youth icons. He also met leaders from the 14-party ruling alliance led by its convener. Discussions centred on different aspects of bilateral relations were held during the meeting, officials said.Modi subsequently held another meeting with leaders of Bangladesh’s opposition parties.Besides holding talks with Hasina, Modi will also offer prayers to Goddess Kali at Jashoreshwari Kali temple, one of 51 Shaktipeeths in the Puranic tradition, and interact with representatives of the Matua community at Orakandi, from where Sri Sri Harichandra Thakur disseminated his message.In her speech, an emotional Hasina recalled India’s contributions to the liberation war and the support she and her family received from former prime minister Indira Gandhi both during the 1971 war and after her father Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and most members of her family were assassinated during a military coup in August 1975.“In our independence war, we always remember the contribution of India,” she said, thanking Modi and the Indian government for conferring the Gandhi Peace Prize for 2020 on Rahman. She also thanked the Indian government for providing Covid-19 vaccines and 109 ambulances as a gift.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/on-historic-visit-pm-recalls-his-struggle-for-bangladesh-101616809933412.html
27-03-2021||India||Thallium murder: Poison, fish were bought online||A 37-year-old resident of Greater Kailash, who was arrested on Wednesday for allegedly poisoning his wife and her family members with thallium, a toxic chemical, bought the substance online from a pharmaceutical firm in Haryana’s Panchkula on the pretext that his father-in-law needed it for research on homeopathic medicines, said police officers involved in the investigation.The accused, Varun Arora, a realtor, got the consignment delivered to his relative’s house in Gurugram.The police said Arora hoped that since thallium is a slow poison, the murders would be passed off as being caused by food poisoning.Investigators said that it did not appear that the relative who received the consignment knew what it contained, and added that they are looking to ascertain the identity of the person who helped Arora get the thallium from the pharmaceutical firm.“We are, however, yet to verify it with the pharmaceutical company if it sold the thallium to Arora after due verification or not. Any possible negligence is being looked into,” said a senior police officer who asked not to be named.Interrogators said that Arora also bought the fish, which he cooked for them, online.They also said that the suspect ensured that neither he nor his twin children ate the fish that he had laced and served his wife and in-laws on January 31 this year.The police arrested Arora for lacing his in-laws’ dinner with thallium on January 31, killing his mother-in-law and sister-in-law, and leaving his wife comatose. The man’s father-in-law and the domestic help recovered after treatment.Police earlier said that Arora claimed to have planned the poisoning after his wife aborted her pregnancy last year, and to exact revenge for “being humiliated”, because his construction business was not doing well. However, this alleged motive has now come into question.Police officers told HT that they are analysing Arora’s social media accounts to probe if the murders were a result of an extramarital affair.Arora is also learnt to have told investigators that he had believed his father would be reincarnated with his child, but was allegedly upset on learning that his wife had aborted the pregnancy.Arora told police that since thallium is tasteless and odourless, he mixed it with water and poured it over the fish. “He gave his four-year-old twins milk to drink right before dinner, so that the family members did not serve them the fish. He did not eat the fish himself, citing religious reasons,” the officer said.Meanwhile, Arora’s wife’s family members have told the police that they suspect Arora may have been involved in an extramarital relationship.A member of his wife’s family, who did not wish to be identified, said, “Arora’s father passed away about two years ago, and his lifestyle changed overnight. We have now learnt that Varun ill-treated his wife and that they had serious fights on a few occasions. He is misleading police by claiming that he was depressed or under financial stress. The family suspects he was in an affair outside the marriage.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/thallium-murder-poison-fish-were-bought-online-101616808926670.html
27-03-2021||India||Ahead of Mahakumbh, Covid-19 cases jump in Haridwar||The number of new Covid-19 cases in Haridwar, where millions are gathering for the Mahakumbh pilgrimage, has grown by over 250% in the last week compared to the first week of the month, and the test positivity rate on Friday was nearly three times of what it was on March 1, reinforcing fears that the gathering is fuelling a bigger outbreak.Between 30 and 50 million pilgrims are expected to visit the shortened month-long festival in April. Before the pandemic, over 120 million people were expected to visit a four-month Mahakumbh. The first shahi snan (royal bath) that kicked off the festivities on March 11 was attended by over 3.3 million people. The next is on April 1.In the first week of the month, 78 new cases were recorded in Haridwar. In the past seven days, this number has grown to 278. But the number of daily tests has not logged any significant increase – there were 4,715 tests on Friday and a little under 4,000 on March 1.On the first day of the month, only 16 cases were recorded, compared to 58 on Friday –a sharp increase in the positivity rate that is reflected over the week as well.As on Friday, Haridwar accounts for 385 active cases of total 1,162 in the state.Officials in other states are now beginning to record infections in pilgrims who went to Haridwar. On Friday, eight people from one family tested positive for Covid-19 in Madhya Pradesh’s Guna district, according to Guna district magistrate Kumar Purshotam.Chief medical officer Haridwar, Dr SK Jha said on Friday that given the expectation that up to 10 million pilgrims can arrive for the Shahi Snan on April 1, testing capacity is being increased and capacity to isolate pilgrims found positive is being strengthened.“Those with no negative Covid-19 reports would be returned. And those found positive through random testing would be isolated. We have capacity to isolate over 10,000 people, with the help of private hospitals. The testing on normal days will be increased as per the pilgrim rush and on Shahi Snan days, it can go even beyond 50,000. For last four days, we have been conducting tests of 3,000 to 5,000 people,” Jha said.The Uttarakhand high court on Wednesday directed the state government to ensure that pilgrims coming for Mahakumbh show a negative RT-PCR test taken not more than 72 hours earlier, after members of the court-appointed committee to check situation and arrangements in Mahakumbh submitted their reports to the court.On Sunday, Centre wrote to the state, stressing that the positivity rate in Haridwar has the potential to rapidly turning to an upsurge in cases, given the expected large footfall during Kumbh.On Friday, the administration announced some curbs on celebrations for Holi (which falls on Monday), allowing venues to host only 50% of their capacity and no single event can exceed an attendance of over 100 people.Anoop Nautiyal, founder of Dehradun-based think tank Social Development for Communities, who has been analysing Covid-19 data for the last year, said the testing numbers in Haridwar need to be scaled up over ten times in accordance with the expectations of the pilgrim influx.“On Thursday, they tested over 3,900 people. With such low testing at present, what can be the situation when one crore people will turn up. It won’t serve the purpose because even if Covid-19 infection is brought by few people into Kumbh area, it has potential to spread in millions”, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ahead-of-mahakumbh-covid-19-cases-jump-in-haridwar-101616796956160.html
27-03-2021||India||States asked to regulate crowds before festivals amid covid spike||The Centre on Friday directed all states and Union territories (UTs) to regulate the crowd and ensure strict enforcement of protocols ahead of various festivals in view of rising coronavirus cases in the country.With 62,267 cases within a span of 24 hours, the overall Covid-19 tally rose to 11,908,357, according the HT dashboard. The active caseload breached the 450,000-mark after four months. The death toll hit to 161,295 with 292 new fatalities.In a letter to chief secretaries of all states and UTs, Union home secretary Ajay Bhalla called for necessary measures to prevent the spread of the virus and directed states and UTs to issue instructions to district administrations and police authorities to “scrupulously enforce Covid appropriate behaviour and SOPs in all public gatherings during the upcoming festivals.”“In view of the upcoming festivals such as Holi, Shab-e-Barat, harvesting festivals, Easter, Eid-ul-Fitr etc, state governments and UT administrations should take necessary measures to regulate crowds during these festivals by ensuring strict observance of Covid appropriate behavior such as wearing of mask and maintaining social distancing as mandated in aforesaid guidelines and in National Directives for Covid-19 management,” Bhalla said in his letter.The official’s letter further mentioned that strict adherence to Covid-appropriate behavior in public places and gatherings will help break the chain of transmission and reduce the virus caseload in the country.“As has been emphasised time and again by health experts, strict adherence to Covid appropriate behaviour in public places and gatherings will help in breaking the chain of transmission and reduce the incidence of Covid cases in the country,” he said.In a fresh set of guidelines on March 23, the Centre had directed the states and UTs to enhance RT-PCR tests, ensure strict enforcement of test-track-treat protocol and increase the pace of vaccination to cover all priority groups.The Centre announced that all fresh cases will require to be isolated or quarantined at the earliest and provided timely treatment. All contacts of the infected cases will also have to be traced quickly and isolated, it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/states-asked-to-regulate-crowds-before-festivals-amid-covid-spike-101616796950181.html
27-03-2021||India||PDP’s Para gave ₹5cr to Hurriyat tokeep Valley on boil: NIA charge sheet||Peoples Democratic Party leader Waheed-ur-Rehman Para gave ₹5 crore to Hurriyat Conference to keep Kashmir on the boil after the encounter of Hizbul Mujahideen terrorist Burhan Wani, the National Investigation Agency has said in a charge sheet filed on Monday.This amount was given by Para “possibly on behalf of PDP to Hurriyat Conference for keeping the secessionist activities alive”, NIA added in the charge sheet. HT has reviewed excerpts of the charge sheet.Para was arrested on November 25 last year by the central agency after multiple rounds of questioning.In a statement issued later in the day, PDP additional spokesperson Najmu Saqib said the charges against Para were an attempt to muzzle the voices of Kashmir.“A through and through democrat who dedicated his life to strengthening the cause of the mainstream in Jammu And Kashmir, Waheed by putting his life and limb in harm’s way, is being punished for what he should’ve been appreciated for,” Saqib said.“We strongly believe that none of these frivolous charges would stand judicial scrutiny and Waheed would eventually get justice,” Saqib added.The charge sheet, which focuses on Para’s role in supporting terror and secessionist activities in Jammu and Kashmir, said “Para gave ₹5 crore in 2016 to Altaf Ahmad Shah alias Fantoosh to keep the situation boiling in Kashmir valley after the killing of HM terrorist Burhan Wani.”Funtoosh is separatist leader Syed Ali Shah Geelani’s son-in-law and a member of the All Parties Hurriyat Conference. He was arrested in July 2017 in a J&K terror funding case.According to the investigation agency, Funtoosh was a close associate of Para and the two maintained contact during the turmoil in the wake of Wani’s killing.Wani, 21-year-old Hizbul commander and the poster boy of militancy in Kashmir, was killed in an encounter with security forces on July 8, 2016. The encounter led to large scale stone pelting and public unrest in the Kashmir valley which went on for months.The encounter took place during the tenure of PDP president Mehbooba Mufti as the erstwhile state’s chief minister.Para has been named as accused in the supplementary charge sheet filed in NIA’s probe against suspended J&K police officer Davinder Singh, who was arrested in January 2020 for assisting HM terrorists.Elaborating on the PDP youth leader’s role in the case, NIA charge sheet said Para also gave ₹10 lakh to advocate Irfan Shafi Mir to hand over to HM terrorists, Syed Naveed Mushtaq alias Naveed Babu. Mir and Naveed were arrested with Singh last year.In February-March 2019, ahead of the Lok Sabha elections, “Irfan Mir called Para on secure social chat platform, Signal, and made him talk to Syed Naveed Mushtaq when he was staying in the rented house of Irfan Mir in Jammu. Para talked to Syed Naveed and asked him to take care of his party workers campaigning for parliament election in Pulwama”, the NIA charge sheet said.The charge sheet also said that Para gave another ₹10 lakh to Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba terrorist Abu Dujana, apart from providing logistical support to LeT commander Naved Jatt. The agency, however, did not mention the year of this exchange.Jatt, who was involved in the killing of journalist Shujaat Bukhari, was gunned down by security forces in November 2018.Subsequently, the agency added “Para was also involved in gun running racket in Kupwara area in 2016”. “He used to bring weapons in his vehicle accompanied by an escort vehicle as none of the security agencies used to check it [him being a politician],” NIA said.According to NIA, Para played a crucial role in sustaining the “political-separatist-terrorist” nexus in Jammu and Kashmir apart from financing the activities of the Hizbul Mujahideen.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pdps-para-gave-5cr-to-hurriyat-tokeep-valley-on-boil-nia-charge-sheet-101616796932107.html
27-03-2021||India||India chalks out 4-point plan to deal with Suez Canal blockage||The Centre has chalked out a four-point plan to deal with the situation arising from the blockage of the Suez Canal including advising ships to re-route via Cape of Good Hope.This plan was chalked out in a meeting convened by the logistics division, department of commerce, government of India Friday. It includes prioritisation of cargo, freight rates, advisory to ports and re-routing of ships.A 193-km canal, which is an artificial sea-level waterway in Egypt, connects the Mediterranean Sea to the Red Sea and provides the shortest sea link between Asia and Europe. The 224,000-tonne container ship was grounded in the Suez Canal on Tuesday morning, completely blocking the traffic along the waterway and delaying a number of ships carrying cargo ranging from oil to consumer goods.Blockage of the Suez Canal is seriously hitting the global trade, the ministry of commerce and industry said in a statement.This route is used for Indian exports/imports worth USD 200 billion to/from North America, South America and Europe. It includes petroleum goods, organic chemicals, iron and steel, automobile, machinery, textiles and carpets, handicrafts including furniture, leather goods, etc.The meeting was chaired by Pawan Agarwal, Special Secretary (Logistics) and attended by the Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Waterways, ADG Shipping, Container Shipping Lines Association (CSLA) and Federation of Indian Export Organisations (FIEO).It was noted in the meeting that over 200 vessels are waiting on the North and South sides of the Suez Canal and about 60 vessels are getting added to the queue on a daily basis, according to the statement."If two more days are taken before the efforts result in clearance of the canal (digging on both sides, extra barges being added on every high tide, tugboats, etc. to straighten the stuck vessel), the total backlog created would be about 350 vessels. It is estimated that this backlog should take about a week time to clear out. It was decided in the meeting to closely monitor the situation," the statement read.Under the prioritisation of cargo, it was decided that FIEO, MPEDA and APEDA will jointly identify cargo particularly perishable cargo for priority movement and work with the shipping lines for the same.The CSLA assured that the freight rates as per existing contracts will be honoured."A request has been made to the shipping lines to maintain stability in freight rates during the period of this crisis. It was noted that the situation is temporary and is unlikely to have a long-lasting impact," the statement read.Once the blockage is over, it is expected that some bunching may take place, especially at the ports of JNPT, Mundra and Hazira, it said."Ministry of ports, shipping and waterways assured to issue an advisory to these ports so as to gear up arrangements and ensure efficient handling during the forthcoming busy period," the statement said.Besides, shipping lines were advised through CSLA to explore the option of re-routing of ships via the Cape of Good Hope. It was pointed that such re-routing usually takes 15 additional days' time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-chalks-out-4-point-plan-to-deal-with-suez-canal-blockage-101616805429223.html
27-03-2021||India||Vaccination pace sluggish, lack of motivation keeping people away, say doctors||The pace of Covid-19 vaccinations is sluggish in the city despite chief minister Arvind Kejriwal mandating that vaccination centres in Delhi will operate for 12 hours a day, from 9am and 9pm, in all Delhi government-run hospitals. The government had also directed its hospitals to run six vaccination centres each on their premises.Since the extended 12-hour vaccination drive began on Monday (March 22), on average, 34,027 jabs have been administered daily. On Friday, only 20,652 shots were administered across Delhi, of which 16,181 were first doses and the rest second doses.In comparison, around 46,769 jabs – both first and second doses — were administered last Saturday, two days before the extended vaccination timings kicked in, government data said.To scale up the capacity from 30,000 to 40,000 shots a day to 125,000 jabs daily, Kejriwal had announced that vaccination sites at Delhi government hospitals will run between 9am and 9pm from March 22. The government order from last Thursday read, “...all the Delhi Government hospitals will operate vaccination sites functioning in their premises up to at least 9pm.”Government analysis so far, however, has shown that there has been an uptick in immunisation in the government centres as compared to private ones. The turnout rate at government centres had increased March 16 onwards, with the centres seeing a 72% turnout (against capacity) on March 18, compared to 49% in private facilities, according to data seen by HT.Doctors from government hospitals, however, said the hospitals anyway had more capacity to vaccinate people. The challenge, they claim, lay in motivating people to come and get the shots.During a spot check earlier this week, HT found that the vaccination centre at two out of three hospitals that this reporter visited, had closed by 5pm.At trans-Yamuna region’s biggest Guru Teg Bahadur hospital, the tented waiting rooms outside its “walk-in” emergency department — it has now been converted into three vaccination centres — remained deserted on Tuesday. At 5:30pm, two staff nurses leaving the centre asked the reporter to return the following day between 9am and 5pm if she wanted to get the shot.“We have a capacity for vaccinating 600 people, but there were only 144 shots administered throughout the day. People are not coming even between 9am and 5pm, they need to be motivated,” said Dr RS Rautela, medical director, Guru Teg bahadur hospital.The “walk-in” emergency department had been set up in 2019 by the hospital to help triage patients outside its main emergency. Any patient who could walk by themselves and hence were thought to have a less severe problem could be treated at the one-hall structure.The structure now houses all three vaccination counters running at the hospital.According to a senior doctor at the hospital, the three sites itself have a capacity to inoculate 600 people. “However, we manage to vaccinate only about 300 to 350 people a day. The number hasn’t picked up despite increasing the capacity. The vaccination centres remain mostly vacant after around three in the afternoon. It is highly unlikely that people will come in at 7pm or 8pm to get their shots here,” said a doctor, on condition of anonymity.Elsewhere, at the Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality hospital, finding the vaccination centre itself was a challenge, with no proper signboard to guide beneficiaries to the vaccination centre behind the main hospital building. The tented waiting room outside was vacant and a lock hung on the door to the single-block vaccination centre at 6pm on Tuesday.A guard stationed at the neighbouring building asked the reporter to return before 5pm the next day.“Our vaccine doses haven’t been increased yet. The districts need to provide us with more manpower and furniture. We have only 200 doses allocated for the hospital and that usually runs out by afternoon. So, there is no point in running the centre till 9pm, just to have people come here and be turned away,” said Dr BL Sherwal, medical director, Rajiv Gandhi Superspeciality hospital, Tahirpur.At the 2,000-bed Lok Nayak hospital, although all major gates to the staircase leading to the upper floors -- where the vaccination centres are located -- had been locked, a sign pointed to the one that remained open for Covid-19 vaccination on Wednesday at 7pm. Outside the site, there were nursing and police personnel who said anybody could get vaccinated 24x7 at the single operational site.Between 9am and 5pm, the hospital runs another vaccination centre at the same location, with a third centre at the super-speciality hospital in the same compound.The 24x7 vaccination centre at the hospital was not a new addition and has been functional for nearly a month now for administering shots to front-line workers who get off duty at odd hours.“We have one centre running at all times. Not many people come to the hospital at night time. Usually, only 10 or maybe 20 come after 5pm, and that too mostly police and CRPF (para military) personnel. Anyone who comes to the hospital at any time can get their shot at the centre,” said Dr Suresh Kumar, medical director, Lok Nayak hospital.The hospital vaccinates around 200 to 300 people a day, although it has a capacity to immunise over 600 persons.“We need to increase the pace of vaccination – it will help in preventing deaths and controlling the surge in infections. The government should vaccinate everyone over the age of 18 in the six states that have started seeing an increase in the number of cases. All the vaccines from other states should be diverted; the others can wait for it. And, we need to vaccinate our teachers and anciliary staff and open up schools and college,” said Dr Jacob John, former head of the department of virology at Christian Medical College-Vellore.The Delhi government refused to comment on the issue, despite repeated attempts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vaccination-pace-sluggish-lack-of-motivation-keeping-people-away-say-doctors-101616796899145.html
27-03-2021||India||Indian, Pak armies hold flag meet on ceasefire agreement||The Indian and Pakistani armies on Friday held a flag meeting in the Poonch sector to ensure that both sides uphold the ceasefire along the Line of Control (LoC) in line with the understanding reached by the two director generals of military operations last month.The two militaries last month announced that they had begun observing a ceasefire along the LoC in Jammu and Kashmir from the midnight of February 24. Friday’s flag meet was held at the brigade commander level.“Post the DGMOs Understanding 2021, a Brigade Commander Level Flag Meeting was held between Indian and Pakistan Army at Poonch Rawalkot Crossing Point on 26 Mar 2021 to discuss implementation mechanism as per the understanding,” the Indian Army said on Twitter.“The ceasefire is holding good and the brigade-commander level flag meet was planned to ensure that both sides adhere to the understanding reached between the two DGMOs,” said a senior official.It is for the first time in about five to six years that the LoC has been silent which bodes well for the future, army chief General MM Naravane said at an event on Friday. He said three reasons behind Pakistan’s move for peace were Financial Action Task Force (FATF) sanctions, domestic compulsions and the situation on its Western border with Afghanistan.The 12 months preceding the announcement by the Indian and Pakistan militaries that they had begun observing a ceasefire along the LoC saw the highest number of border violations by the neigbouring army since the original ceasefire agreement in November 2003.Official figures obtained by HT show that the Pakistan Army violated the ceasefire at least a dozen times daily on an average between February 2020 and February 2021 when both sides agreed to strict observance of all agreements and understandings to observe a ceasefire along the LoC.The year 2020 witnessed 4,645 violations by Pakistan on the LoC, with August and September – the first anniversary of the Centre revoking the special status of the state on August 5, 2019 – accounting for the highest number of violations for any two consecutive months in 17 years. This figure for last year stood at more than 5,100 if the violations along the international border are also counted.Data shows August and September alone accounted for 835 ceasefire violations last year. Ceasefire violations by the Pakistani Army sharply increased over the last five years – recording a 10-fold jump since 2016 when the Indian Army carried out surgical strikes against terror pads in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir in response to the Pakistan-backed suicide attack on an army camp in Uri. The year 2016 accounted for 449 violations, with the numbers only rocketing in the following years – 881 (2017), 1,629 (2018) and 3,168 (2019).The unusual spike in ceasefire violations by the Pakistan army on the LoC in recent years was to help terrorist infiltrators sneak into Jammu and Kashmir to feed the terror machinery in the state and destabilise the region.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indian-pak-armies-hold-flag-meet-on-ceasefire-agreement-101616796922138.html
27-03-2021||India||Doorstep delivery scheme face-off: Centre wrote to Delhi govt over ‘ration quality’ in city||A day before it red-flagged the Delhi government’s doorstep ration delivery scheme on March 19, the Union ministry of food and public distribution pulled up the state administration for “repeated delays” in submitting action-taken reports required to be filed on the use of electronic point of sale (e-POS) machines in ration shops and on improving the “quality” of subsidised foodgrains being disbursed in the Capital, according to government documents.The ministry wrote two letters to the government on March 18. While one was a reminder to submit a report on the quality of foodgrains being distributed and on steps taken to remove discrepancies in the city’s public distribution system, the other was about a delay in the trial of e-POS machines in Delhi’s 2,000-odd fair price shops (FPS).HT has seen the documents.A day later, on March 19, the Union ministry raised objections to the doorstep ration delivery scheme, saying its name, cost and method of delivery were not in accordance with the National Food Security Act (NFSA).The Delhi government said that the Centre was trying to block its flagship scheme, and altered the name of the programme on March 24 so that it could be implemented.However, the Union government later said that there were other problems related to distribution.One of the two letters sent by the Union ministry on March 18 read: “GNCTD (the government of the National Capital Territory of Delhi government) had informed this (the Union ministry of food and public distribution) department that the trial and testing of portability transactions under ‘one nation one ration card’ (ONORC) shall be done shortly. Further, during the meeting convened by the Union home secretary on February 23, 2021, GNCTD informed that the results of the trial and testing of portability transactions shall be shared within one week. The same are still awaited.”Another official said that Union food minister Piyush Goyal had written to the Delhi government, asking them to adopt the ONORCThe second letter sent to the Delhi government on March 18 was a reminder asking it to respond to an October 23, 2020, letter from Union food secretary Sudhanshu Pandey to chief secretary Vijay Dev, which said that routine inspections at 71 fair price shops showed that 30% of ration being distributed in Delhi was unfit for consumption.The letter said that 90 of the 138 samples were beyond the rejection limit (BRL) as mandated by the Centre’s uniform specifications of foodgrains (wheat and rice). The letter also contended that 42 other samples (18 wheat and 24 rice) were “unfit for human consumption.”Delhi food and civil supplies minister Imran Hussain said, “As far as the use of the e-POS machines in ration shops is concerned, the ONORC and door-to-door ration schemes in Delhi will be ensured in all ration shops. The state cabinet took this call, and it has been brought to the Centre’s notice,” he said.Hussain also said foodgrains being sent from the Centre’s godowns were of “poor quality.”“During last year’s lockdown, we had complained to the Centre about the rotten ration we received from them. I even wrote a letter to the concerned Union minister, demanding immediate action.

27-03-2021||India||Supreme Court dismisses plea against sale of electoral bonds||The Supreme Court on Friday cleared the sale of the electoral bonds ahead of elections in West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Assam, Kerala and Puducherry finding no justification to block their sale over concerns of anonymity in political party funding or apprehensions of their misuse. The 10-day sale window will open, as scheduled, on April 1.Dismissing two stay applications moved by NGO Association for Democratic Reforms, filed in 2019 and earlier this month, a three-judge bench of the apex court headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde noted that the sale of these bonds, which began in January 2018, have continued “without any impediment” in 2018, 2019 and 2020.In April 2019, the Court introduced an interim “safeguard” by directing all political parties to submit details of receipts of the electoral bonds to the Election Commission in a sealed cover. This was done as an interim measure till the pending petitions challenging the validity of these electoral bonds were decided. With this order still in vogue, the bench, also comprising Justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian, said, “certain safeguards have already been provided by this Court in its interim order of April 12, 2019, (and) we do not see any justification for the grant of stay at this stage.”The Election Commission which supported the electoral bond policy in the top court said it has received sealed covers from various political parties (national, state, registered and unregistered) as per the April 12, 2019 order. The list of parties that submitted the covers were also furnished to the Court.Further, the court held that this interim arrangement will now remain and no applications for stay will be entertained every time the window for sale of electoral bonds is opened.ADR, in its application claimed that electoral bonds could be a channel for corporate bribes to be paid to political parties as a quid pro quo since the scheme envisaged anonymity for donors. The Centre, represented by Attorney General KK Venugopal submitted that the idea of introducing these bonds was to prevent black money holding sway over elections.In support of his concerns, ADR’s counsel Prashant Bhushan relied on a letter written by Reserve Bank of India (RBI) way back in September 2017 (before introduction of the scheme) expressing serious reservations over it. The bench, after examining a series of letters written by RBI concluded that much of the banking regulator’s concerns were addressed in the final version of the scheme.The judges noted that in one letter, RBI went to the extent of calling electoral bonds “an enduring reform consistent with the Government’s digitization push.” RBI’s only objection was to the issue of bonds in scrip form rather than in dematerialised (electronic) form. The bench held, “It is not correct to say that RBI and EC opposed the electoral bond scheme itself….RBI wanted to achieve the twin advantage of providing anonymity to the contributor and ensuring that consideration for transfers is through banking channels and not cash or other means. The concerns expressed by RBI to the form and not to the substance, cannot really advance the case of the petitioners.”Bhushan further alleged that the bond could be purchased by a person using white money and later transferred to somebody in black. The Court ruled out the scope of such a transaction as purchasers of bonds will have to comply with KYC norms and their identities are anyway known to the State Bank of India, which issues the bonds. If a company makes a donation through electoral bonds, the Companies Act requires financial statements of registered companies to be filed with the Registrar of Companies. Further, the scheme also mandates political parties to file audited statements of accounts each year with the Election Commission.“Therefore, it is not as though the operations under the scheme are behind iron curtains incapable of being pierced…All that is required is a little more effort to cull out such information from both side (purchaser of bond and political party) and do some `match the following’,” added the bench. Clause 14 of the Electoral Bond Scheme introduced by way of amendments to the Finance Act and Representation of Peoples Act in January 2018 specifically prohibits trading of bonds. The Court cited this clause to allay Bhushan’s fears of subsequent transfer of bonds.Welcoming the order, Bharatiya Janata Party spokesperson Nalin Kohli said: “Now that the honourable Supreme Court has decided in favour of the electoral bonds one hopes there will be closure to what was an unnecessary controversy on a good decision with regard to electoral funding.”Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala, however, termed the bonds a “dubious money laundering operation”. “SC must expose #ElectoralBonds for what they have become-: 1. A dubious money laundering operation to help one party. 2. A veiled mechanism to legitimize quid-pro-quo deals. 3. An untraceable funnel for black money payments. If not now, then when?,” he tweeted.ADR Founder Jagdeep Chhokar said, “The judgment is disappointing. The interim arrangement on which the Court has relied is unworkable. The EC cannot know the donors of these bonds received by political parties. Further, the Court has said that information about the donors can be known by making a little effort. if this information can be found then why can’t it be made available in public domain. We hope this order does not impact our petition pending on the larger questions of law challenging these bonds.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-dismisses-plea-against-sale-of-electoral-bonds-101616796889222.html
27-03-2021||India||Two suffocate to death while cleaning septic tank in Ghazipur||Two men suffocated to death after they were allegedly made to clean a septic tank without any protective gear at a banquet hall in east Delhi’s Ghazipur late Thursday night. Police have detained the housekeeping manager, general manager and the owner of the banquet hall for questioning but have not made any arrest till Friday evening.The deceased were identified as Lokesh Kumar, 35, and Prem Chand, 40 — both worked as caterers in weddings and lived in Trilokpuri, east Delhi.They were promised a meagre ₹1,500 per man for cleaning the tank, the police later said.Delhi had banned manual scavenging— defined as manually cleaning, carrying, disposing or handling human excreta from dry latrines and sewers—on August 21, 2017.Senior police officers said a call was received around 10.23pm at Patparganj Industrial Area police station stating that two men had died after entering a septic tank at Pearl HlGrand Emperor banquet hall. Deputy commissioner of police (east) Deepak Yadav said a team rushed to the spot and learnt that the men had been called in for cleaning the tank around 7.30pm by one Rahul (single name only), the housekeeping manager. “Later, around 10pm, Rahul found the men lying unconscious in the tank and alerted the police and other staff members of the hall. As soon as we received information, a crime and forensics team, along with teams from Delhi Fire Service, Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) and MCD Boat Club, reached the spot, pulled the men out of the tank and rushed them to a hospital, where they were declared brought dead,” Yadav said.The DCP said the identities of the two men were established following local inquiries. “Their bodies were sent to Lal Bahadur Shastri hospital for autopsy. Preliminary probe suggests that the duo died of asphyxiation but we are waiting for a detailed autopsy report. Following the initial inquiry, a case has been registered under the IPC section 304A for causing death due to negligence and under Section 9 of the Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavenger and Their Rehabilitation Act against unknown people,” the officer said.Yadav said the general manager of the banquet hall, Amir Khan, housekeeping manager Rahul and banquet hall owner Jimmy Arora have been detained and are being questioned. “We are trying to establish the sequence of events that led to the fatalities. Adequate legal action will be taken,” the DCP said.Later on Friday, around 50 people from the two men’s families and those from Delhi sanitation workers unions gathered outside the banquet hall and staged a protest demanding the immediate arrest of the owner and the housekeeping manager.Chairman of the union, Sanjay Gehlot, said despite the government having provided machines to clean septic tanks and sewers, people use labourers as that is the cheaper option. “This is cruelty. The workers were not given any safety equipment or protective gear. We demand adequate compensation for families of the two men,” Gehlot said.Police said, while Lokesh is survived by his wife and two children, a 15-year-old daughter and a 12-year-old son. Prem Chand has a wife and two sons aged 15 and 9 years in his family.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/two-suffocate-to-death-while-cleaning-septic-tank-in-ghazipur-101616796884252.html

In 2019, he was brought to Rupnagar jail in connection with an alleged extortion case in Mohali.The court’s directive came on a plea by the UP government seeking a direction to the Punjab government and Rupnagar jail authority to immediately hand over the custody of the legislator.The court, however, rejected the UP government’s plea, seeking transfer of the extortion case from Punjab to it. It also dismissed Ansari’s petition seeking transfer of cases filed in UP against him to some other place outside the state.A bench of Justices Ashok Bhushan and R Subhash Reddy directed the Punjab government to hand over the custody of Ansari to Banda jail authorities in UP. It further told Banda prison authorities to extend all medical facilities to the accused.“In our opinion, a convict or an undertrial prisoner, who disobeys the law of the land, cannot oppose his transfer from one prison to another… Courts are not to be a helpless bystander, when the rule of law is being challenged with impunity. In such situations, this court can exercise power under Article 142 of the Constitution of India to order transfer of prisoner from one prison to another,” the bench observed.“Custody is denied to the Police of Uttar Pradesh at every time on trivial grounds under guise of medical grounds by mentioning ordinary diseases,” the bench added.The UP government had earlier contended that Ansari had been “dodging” the judicial system and was continuing with his alleged illegal activities from Rupnagar district. The Yogi Adityanath-led government also alleged in the apex court that there is a “collusion” between Ansari and Punjab Police.Refuting the claims, the Amarinder Singh government raised questions over the maintainability of the plea filed by his UP counterpart. On March 4, it informed the top court that the UP government did not have the fundamental right to seek Ansari’s transfer.Since 2019, Ansari has not applied for a bail nor has Punjab Police filed a charge sheet in the case.Due to his stay in the Punjab prison, multiple trials pending against him before the Special MP/MLA court in Allahabad were adjourned on various occasions. The warrants issued by the UP courts were also not entertained by Punjab jail authorities citing the “ill health” of the accused.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hand-over-mukhtar-ansari-to-up-in-14-days-sc-to-punjab-101616791705163.html

How can there be a question of abetment when she didn’t die by suicide,” Pahwa said adding that the police investigation has conclusively established by way of opinion from renowned doctors that she had not died by suicide.He also cited several judgments and sought the discharge of Tharoor from the case. The court put up the matter for further hearing to April 9.Pushkar was found dead in the suite of a luxury hotel in the city on the night of January 17, 2014, following which the police had charged Tharoor with abetment to suicide, among other charges.Tharoor has consistently denied all charges, calling them “preposterous and motivated”.On May 14, 2018, Tharoor had tweeted: “ I have taken note of the filing of this preposterous charge sheet & intend to contest it vigorously. No one who knew Sunanda believes she would ever have committed suicide, let alone abetment on my part...If this is conclusion arrived at after 4+ yrs of investigation it does not speak well of the methods or motivations of the Delhi Police.”On March 17, during arguments, Pahwa had told the court that doctors have not been able to ascertain the cause of death or establish whether Pushkar had indeed died by suicide and, hence, the case of abetment to suicide against Tharoor was nothing but “a figment of imagination of the police”.He had earlier said the post-mortem examination and other medical reports have allegedly established that it was neither a suicide nor homicide. He had also said during the course of the investigation, there have been a plethora of reports by experts before the investigating officer (IO) but there was “no definite opinion on the cause of death”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sunanda-could-not-have-killed-herself-no-question-of-abetment-tharoor-to-court-101616791694105.html
27-03-2021||India||Despite teachers’ opposition, JNU approves appointment of new registrar||Despite opposition from the Jawaharlal Nehru University Teachers’ Association (JNUTA), the varsity’s vice-chancellor and members of its executive council (EC) approved the appointment of a new registrar in a meeting on Friday.On Thursday, the administration included an additional agenda item for the EC meeting, seeking “post-facto” approval of the appointment of Anirban Chakraborty as the JNU registrar — a move that JNUTA opposed, arguing that the “post-facto approval” undermined the EC’s powersJNUTA spokespersons said the registrar’s appointment should have been approved by the EC first. The teacher’s body said in this case, vice-chancellor Jagadesh Kumar had appointed the registrar and then sought “post-facto approval” during the EC meeting on Friday.Despite several attempts, Chakraborty did not respond to calls and texts sent for comment.On Friday, EC members approved Chakraborty’s appointment and the administration said he will “take care of the office of the registrar until a new registrar is appointed, for which an advertisement has already been issued.”The university said the appointment was done as per statute 8 (2) of the JNU Act which says, “When the office of the registrar is vacant or when the registrar is, by reason of illness or absence for any other cause, unable to perform the-duties of his office, the duties of the office shall be performed by such person as the vice-chancellor may appoint for the purpose.”“It is unfortunate that a few faculty members of JNU have tried to manufacture a controversy over an appointment which is otherwise a routine process,” read a statement issued by rector 1 Chintamani Mahapatra on Friday.Reacting to the development, JNUTA secretary Moushumi Basu said, “The EC agenda was changed twice in response to letters written by JNUTA and press reports. It was only Thursday evening that the registrar matter was brought up as part of the additional agenda. The university must explain their misdeed and misappropriation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/despite-teachers-opposition-jnu-approves-appointment-of-new-registrar-101616791628002.html
27-03-2021||India||Nitika Tomar murder: Family to approach higher court for death penalty||Family of 21-year-old Nikita Tomar who was killed last October said they were disappointed with the life sentence awarded to her killers. They said they would move the Punjab and Haryana high court seeking the death penalty.On Friday, a Faridabad fast-track court said Touseef’s and Rehaan’s crime against the young woman could not be considered as a “rarest of the rare” case and could not be sentenced to death.When the judgment was delivered, anguished family members, activists and other raised slogans demanding capital punishment.Touseef and Rehaan had tried to abduct Nikita on October 26, 2020 from in front of her college in Ballabhgarh. When they failed, one of them shot her. The video of the incident went viral.Nikita’s father Moolchand Tomar on Friday said they were seeking the death penalty as the duo had brutally killed her in a planned and premeditated manner.“They roamed around my daughter’s college for four days with a plan to abduct her and killed her when she resisted,” he said.Nikita’s family were also disappointed that despite making a promise to name an educational institute after her, the state government had not yet done so. “Nikita fought for the honour of women and went down fighting. She must be honoured for her sacrifice,” said Navin Tomar, Nikita’s brother.The family said the government had also promised financial assistance or a job to one of them, which too had not been fulfilled.“I lost my job and spent ₹6-7 lakh in fighting this case. We had to hire a lawyer in Chandigarh to ensure justice for Nikita. My son’s career is also in the doldrums,” said Moolchand.Virender Gaur, a city-based social activist, who has been supporting the family said, “The authorities must come good on promises made by them.”A senior official of the Faridabad district administration said that all efforts were made to get justice for the victim due to which the accused were sentenced within five months of the crime. “The decision of naming of an institution can only be taken at state government level,” he said, on the condition of anonymity.“The first priority in this matter was to ensure justice was delivered to the victim. The police and the court have done their jobs meticulously. The remaining issues raised by family would also be resolved in due course of time,” said Amit Arya, media advisor to Haryana CM.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nitika-tomar-murder-family-to-approach-higher-court-for-death-penalty-101616791600349.html
27-03-2021||India||NGT panel finds damage to 30% mangroves in Andhra’s Kakinada||A joint committee constituted by the National Green Tribunal (NGT) to look into the cutting of mangrove forests in the coastal area of Kakinada in Andhra Pradesh’s East Godavari district for a housing project, has confirmed destruction of nearly 30% of the mangrove area at the site. The committee also directed the district administration not to proceed with the township project and to take “remedial measures” for “rejuvenation of mangroves”.In its report submitted to the southern bench of the NGT on March 17, the committee observed that out of the total extent of mangroves spread over 116 acres, work has been taken up on 58 acres for “Navaratnaalu-Pedalanadirki Illu” (nine jewels-house sites for the poor) programme, thereby affecting mangroves in an extent of 30% of the filled-up area. The house sites’ distribution programme was launched on December 25, but the preparatory work like identification of sites and levelling of sites began in March 2020.“The mangrove area also falls under Coastal Regulatory Zone-I area (CRZ-I), which is ecologically sensitive and the geomorphologic features of this zone play a role in the maintaining the integrity of the coast. As per CRZ notification 2011, no new construction shall be permitted in CRZ-I,” the committee noted.District collector D Muralidhar Reddy, who was also one of the members of the committee, said the government had initiated the process of change in the CRZ category of the said land from CRZ-I to CRZ II, as the land is not a notified forest land, but a waste land as per the revenue records.The NGT, in its order dated March 18, directed that the district administration should not proceed with further development of the township in the said area till the necessary permissions from the competent authorities are obtained. The tribunal directed that the government take remedial measures for rejuvenation of mangroves and other trees in that area considering the eco-sensitiveness of that area.“Besides, considering the nature of damage alleged to have committed, the government must quantify the damage caused to the environment taking into account the amount required for re-rejuvenation of the mangroves and loss of green cover and restoration of the same in that area to protect the environment,” the tribunal said and posted the case to April 26.The committee, however, felt that there is no threat to the existing Coringa Wild Life Sanctuary due to the housing project, which is located at about 3 km away.The committee was constituted on April 30, 2020, following a petition filed by environmentalist Satyanarayana Bolishetty in the NGT, challenging the state government’s decision to fell and remove mangroves and fill up the land to develop house sites for the poor.The six-member committee comprises C Palpandi, scientist from ministry of environment and forests (MoEF), K Prijilal, research officer in MoEF, district collector D Muralidhar Reddy, conservator of forests, Rajahmundry, N Nageshwara Rao; District Forest Officer, East Godavari, B Sunil Kumar Reddy and environmental engineer of Andhra Pradesh Coastal Zone Management Authority A Rama Rao Naidu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ngt-panel-finds-damage-to-30-mangroves-in-andhra-s-kakinada-101616791582113.html
27-03-2021||India||Bharat Bandh: Roads blocked, rail services hit in Punjab and Haryana||A 12-hour Bharat Bandh called by farmer groups affected large parts of Punjab, Haryana, Bihar and western Uttar Pradesh with road and rail transport severely hampered, although the impact of the nationwide demonstration was largely limited in other regions of the country.The bandh, called by the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) to protest against the three contentious farm laws, was in force from 6am to 6pm. Dozens of farm leaders and activists were detained and the northern railways said 41 passenger trains and 40 freight trains had to be cancelled, diverted or delayed.The nationwide bandh was called to mark the day the agitation on the outskirts of the national capital completed four months. Thousands of farmers have been protesting at Delhi’s borders since November 26, seeking a repeal of the three farm laws passed by Parliament in September last year – Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act.The farmers fear the new laws will dismantle the Minimum Support Price (MSP)-system and corporatise farming. Talks between unions and the central government failed to resolve the stalemate despite 12 rounds of meetings.Friday’s protests led to the blockage of railway tracks in at least 44 locations under the Delhi, Ambala and Ferozepur divisions of the railways, leading to cancellation of four high-speed Shatabdi trains, and the delay of 35 other passenger trains and 40 goods trains, according to a northern railway spokesperson DJ Narain.“Barring some limited number of trains in Punjab and Haryana, the bandh has had almost zero impact across the nation. Other than in these two states, around five to six trains were delayed for some time. Less than 0.5% of trains impacted nationally. Trains are running smoothly,” he said.On Friday, security was increased across toll plazas and railway stations in Punjab and Haryana as farmers blocked traffic on highways. Several shops remained shut and both public and private vehicles stayed off roads for the day.“There are reports of successful ‘Bharat Bandh’ from almost every district in Haryana. Markets and other services in cities like Kurukshetra, Karnal, Sonipat, Yamunanagar, Ambala etc remained suspended. In Punjab, ‘Bharat Bandh’ programs were held in more than 200 places, including Mansa, Amritsar, Moga, Ferozepur, Jalandhar,” a statement said, adding that there was “impressive” impact in Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh.The Eastern Peripheral Expressway near the national capital, too, was blocked while a sit-in was staged on a road connecting Delhi’s Nizamuddin to neighbouring Ghaziabad in the National Capital Region, news agency PTI reported.Chamber of Trade and Industry (CTI) chairman Brijesh Goyal said there was no impact of the shutdown on markets and industrial areas of the national capital.In Haryana, farmers blocked the Delhi-Ambala and Rohtak-Delhi highways with their tractors, and only allowed movement of school buses and ambulances in the area.Akhil Bhartiya Kisan Sabha secretary Dayanand Punia said the demonstrators laid siege to railway platforms in the state till 6pm. “The labourers also joined our protest and rural areas also remained shut on Friday,” he said.In Uttar Pradesh, the impact of the bandh was largely seen in western districts, with farmers blocking roads and highways in areas such as Bulandshahr, Meerut, Agra and Muzaffarnagar, BKU leaders said.Twenty CPI (Marxist-Leninist) activists, protesting in Sikandarpur township of Ballia district, were taken into custody, news agency PTI reported.In Gujarat, farmer leader Yudhvir Singh was detained for allegedly holding a press conference in a hotel in Ahmedabad without police permission and in violation of Covid-19 norms. “Gujarat has truly become a police state,” Jignesh Mevani, an independent legislator, said.Barring areas such as Thane, Palghar, Nashik and Ahmednagar, the protest was overall scaled down in Maharashtra in the wake of surge of Covid-19 infections. “Due to the coronavirus outbreak, no large scale rallies have been planned in the state. However, we are submitting our petitions to 400 taluka centres and 30 collector officers in support of the farmers protest,” Sangharsh Samiti, an umbrella organisation of 110 farmers, said in a statement.Stray incidents of forceful closure of businesses were reported but the strike remained largely peaceful in Bihar. There were little to no signs of a shutdown in poll-bound Assam, West Bengal, Kerala and Tamil Nadu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bharat-bandh-roads-blocked-rail-services-hit-in-punjab-and-haryana-101616791578081.html
27-03-2021||India||Delhi temperature summer woes Mercury likely to touch 38° Celsius by Monday: IMD||Temperatures in the national capital, which has seen a consistently warmer-than-usual March, are set to rise over the weekend and mercury is likely to touch 38 degrees Celsius by Monday, according to weather forecast by scientists at the India Meteorological Department (IMD).The spike in temperature is expected as the Capital has seen clear skies in recent days, allowing direct sunlight to hit the land surface, officials added.Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre, said on Friday, “The mercury levels will be on a rising trend till March 29. It is likely to be one of the warmest Holi that the city has ever seen, but the comparison would be a little difficult because the festival falls on different dates.”However, there will be partial relief from the heat soon after, with temperatures expected to fall from March 30. “There is a forecast of strong winds on March 30 and March 31; this will help bring down the temperature again. From Tuesday, the maximum temperature is expected to be around 31-32 degrees Celsius again,” said Srivastava.On Friday, the Safdarjung weather station, which is considered the official marker for the Capital city, recorded a maximum temperature of 32 degrees Celsius, normal for this time of the year. The minimum temperature was 16 degrees Celsius, a notch below normal.March had largely recorded above normal temperatures, before the city’s residents heaved a sigh of relief this week as light rain coupled with strong winds brought down mercury.IMD officials said on Friday that temperatures for this month are likely to be at least 3-4 degrees higher than normal. The mean maximum temperature (MMT), which is the mean of the average maximum temperatures recorded in a particular month over the years, for March is normally 29.6 degrees Celsius. This time, it may touch 32°C.The highest single-day temperature to ever be recorded in March was in 1945, when the mercury levels crossed the 40°C mark.Meanwhile, the city’s air quality continued to remain in the “moderate” zone for the second consecutive day on Friday, likely driven by strong winds that allow for dispersal of pollutants.Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) recordings show that the overall air quality index (AQI) of Delhi on Friday was 150. On Thursday, the average AQI was 148, also in the “moderate” zone. The IMD has forecast that AQI levels are likely to remain this in the category through the weekend before a minor deterioration on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-temperature-summer-woes-mercury-likely-to-touch-38-celsius-by-mondayimd-101616791568010.html
27-03-2021||India||Day after Srinagar terror attack, 2 LeT associates held||Two Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) overground workers, who were allegedly involved in the attack on a CRPF convoy in Lawaypora that claimed two lives, were arrested on Friday. The two arrested have been identified as Muzaffar Mir and Javaid Sheikh. They had provided logistic support for carrying out the attack. A local Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) terrorist Nadeem Abrar Bhat and two other foreign terrorists who executed the attack are on the run.Inspector general of police Vijay Kumar said the case had been solved: “It was due to the joint efforts of the Bandipore and Srinagar police that the case was solved.” Kumar said that Nadeem of Narbal, Budgam, who is a known Lashkar commander, had visited his relative Muzaffar three days ago and sought assistance in carrying out the attack with the help of two overground workers. “Muzaffar sought help from his timber business partner, Javaid. The three carried a reconnaissance of the area and planned the attack that took place in Lawaypora (on the outskirts of Srinagar), in which two CRPF men were killed and two others injured,” he said. The IG said soon after the attack, the area was cordoned and sources activated. “In the meantime, the Bandipore police arrested Javaid. A few empty cartridges were found in his vehicle. After interrogation, he revealed all details of the attack,” he said, adding that Muzaffar’s car had been seized and both arrested persons had confessed their crime.“An operation has been launched at two places to arrest Nadeem and two other foreign terrorists who were involved in the attack. They will be neutralised soon.” Meanwhile, a wreath laying ceremony was held in Srinagar and bodies of CRPF personnel were airlifted to their native places.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/day-after-srinagar-terror-attack-2-let-associates-held-101616790812991.html

27-03-2021||India||62k new cases in country, Maha clamps night curfew||New Delhi/Mumbai: A total of 62,267 new infections of Covid-19 were reported across India on Friday, the highest single-day increase in cases since October 16, as the country’s second wave of the continued to push case numbers up forcing local governments to reintroduce curbs on social gatherings just ahead of Holi and the festive season. Active cases in India, meanwhile, soared near the half million mark.Maharashtra on Friday announced the imposition of a night curfew across the state from March 28 in an attempt to curb the outbreak. The state, which is the worst-hit by the virus, reported 36,902 new cases – highest single-day increase ever. This is the sixth time in nine days that the state has set a new all-time record for daily cases, a statistic that highlights how the recent outbreak there is much worse than anything seen in the state in the first wave.As several states grappled with resurgence of infections, Centre on Friday rushed two high-level multidisciplinary teams to Chhattisgarh and Chandigarh, areas that have both seen recent surge, to assist the local governments in managing the outbreak. After Friday’s 62,267 cases, India’s seven-day average of infections, which denotes the country’s case curve, soared to 50,485, also the worst since mid-October. More than a quarter million new cases have been reported across the country in just the last five days. An analysis by HT reported on Thursday showed that Covid cases in the second wave are rising at a rate faster than they were even during the worst of the first wave (July to September).This surge has pushed the number of active cases in the country close to the 500,000-mark for the first time since November. As of Friday night, there are 454,178 active cases across the country. The number of active cases in India crossed the million-mark in September, when the first wave peaked, but it was dropping rapidly since. This receding trend, however, reversed a month ago with the start of the new wave of infections.In Maharashtra, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray the ordered night curfew from Sunday after holding a meeting with senior officials to review the preparedness against the disease. He warned of stricter restrictions if the people did not observe Covid-19 safety protocol. “I do not wish to impose lockdown. But there seems a possibility of health care facilities falling short given the rise in number of coronavirus patients,” Thackeray said in a statement.Maharashtra is the latest among a string of states that have been forced to reintroduce curbs on social gatherings ahead of Holi and other festivals. Last week, Punjab and Madhya Pradesh clamped restrictions on public assembly and gatherings. In Delhi, celebrations and gatherings at public places and religious sites were banned for Holi, Navaratri and Shab-e-Barat on Tuesday.Other than Maharashtra, two other states – Punjab and Gujarat – also set new records of single-day new cases. Punjab reported 3,122 new cases while 2,190 new infections were reported in Gujarat. Several other states and UTs –Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Haryana, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh – are displaying strong upward trajectories in the past month.Centre on Friday rushed two high-level multidisciplinary teams to Chhattisgarh and Chandigarh in light of rising cases. “These teams shall work with the respective State/UT government to ascertain the reason/s for surge, assist in undertaking gap analysis and recommend requisite Covid-19 control and containment measures,” said Union ministry of health and family welfare in a statement.Chhattisgarh recorded 2,665 new cases, highest in five months, while Chandigarh reported 248 new infections on Friday.The team to Chhattisgarh is headed by Dr SK Singh, director, National Center for Disease Control (NCDC), and has experts from All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Raipur, and All India Institute of Hygiene and Public Health. The team to Chandigarh is led by Vijoy Kumar Singh, additional secretary and financial advisor, ministry of textiles, with experts drawn from New Delhi’s Dr RML Hospital and Safdarjung Hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/62k-new-cases-in-country-maha-clamps-night-curfew-101616784930748.html
27-03-2021||India||Jarkiholi booked after woman files sexual assault complaint||The Bengaluru police on Friday registered an FIR against Karnataka BJP leader Ramesh Jarkiholi on several charges, including “sexual intercourse by a person in authority” and “sexual assault”, based on a handwritten complaint filed by the woman who featured in the video linked to the sexual harassment case. The complaint comes a day after the woman released a video raising doubts over the credibility of the Special Investigation Team probing the case and sought protection for her family. The woman, who is absconding, sent the two-page complaint to Bengaluru police commissioner Kamal Pant  through her lawyer.  In the letter, the woman has alleged that the former minister sexually exploited her on the pretext of a job. According to the FIR, Jarkiholi has been booked under sections 376C (Sexual intercourse by a person in authority), 354A (Sexual harassment), 506 (Criminal intimidation), 504 (Insult to provoke breach of peace) and 417 (cheating) of the Indian Penal Code and Section 67 A (transmitting obscene material) of the Information Technology Act. As per the complaint filed by the woman, she met then minister Jarkiholi during the shooting of a short film in Bengaluru. “Since then, he used to call me often and ask about me, my family... Then he offered to give me a government job using his influence and said that I should cooperate with him,” the letter read.“Once he called me and said that he is staying in the Karnataka Bhavan in New Delhi. He later called me through video and asked me to show my private parts... I did as he said because he was an influential man,” she added. Once Jarkiholi returned to Bengaluru, he asked the woman to visit him at his house to discuss the job offer, where they had sexual intercourse, the woman wrote in her complaint. “This happened twice. I obliged out of fear. When asked about the job he offered, he told me to ask for some money if I needed it and the job can be looked at later,” read the letter, adding that the leader has also verbally abused her on several occasions.The woman has also alleged that Jarkiholi has threatened him of dire consequences and sought protection for her family. “Protection should be provided to my family and I. Action should be taken against Ramesh Jarkiholi for sexually exploiting me, cheating, offering a job, verbally abusing and trying to kill me,” she has alleged. On Thursday, in a video statement, the woman sought protection for her family saying: “I will appear before the SIT only after the safety of my parents is ensured. I will take care of all further procedures and also provide statements (once their safety is ensured).” Dismissing the allegations, Jarkiholi told reporters that “his game begins” on Saturday. “I knew this would happen. This was her final move. My game will start tomorrow (Saturday)… I also have lawyers with me,” he said. “I dislodged one government and installed another one. What’s this? I will face more such complaints,” he told reporters in Bengaluru. He further added that his complaint should be investigated first. “I filed a complaint first, so my FIR should be looked into first,” he said.A senior BJP leader said the party’s stand is to keep its distance from the case, as it is under investigation. “Law will take its course,” said the leader. There was no immediate response from the Congress.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jarkiholi-booked-after-woman-files-sexual-assault-complaint-101616784271471.html
27-03-2021||India||Delhi’s ambitious road revamp plan hits green ministry roadblock||The Delhi government’s ambitious project to redesign 540km of the city roads, along the lines of those in European countries, has hit a roadblock days after the work began, with the Union ministry of environment, forests and climate change (MoEFCC) on Thursday ordering an inquiry against the Delhi public works department (PWD) for allegedly damaging trees and undertaking constructions on a stretch of the Ring Road between Moti Bagh and Mayapuri demarcated as “deemed forest”. Prachi Gangwar, deputy inspector general (forests), regional office of the Union environment ministry, on Thursday sent a letter to the principal chief conservator of forests, Delhi forests department, to file a report on the violations and the action taken against the PWD for violating the Delhi Preservation of Trees (1994) Act. Delhi government spokespersons did not respond to requests for comment.“You are requested to submit a factual report based on field inspection in reference of the complaint letter. In case a violation is reported in the matter, action is solicited as per the rules and guidelines of the MoEFCC,” read the letter from Gangwar. The forest department had on March 12 issued a notice to PWD to stop work on a stretch of the Ring Road between south Delhi’s Moti Bagh and Mayapuri for allegedly damaging trees (during trenching) in an area which is a deemed forest. This stretch is among nine roads that are to be redesigned on a pilot basis, as part of the Delhi government’s “redesigning and street scaping of roads” plan, announced by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal in 2019. Ring Road also features in the original list of areas identified as deemed forest land in an affidavit submitted to the Supreme Court by the Delhi forest department in 1997 in the TN Godavarman Thirumulpad v Union of India case. In Delhi’s context, “an area above 2.5 acres having a density of 100 trees per acre as well as stretches along roads and drains having a length of one kilometre,” are considered ”deemed forests”, according to the affidavit.For any “non-forest related activity” to take place in such an area, permissions have to be sought from the Union ministry of environment, under the Forest Conservation Act (1980).A senior forest department official said they are conducting inspections on the stretch and added that a detailed report will be submitted before the Union ministry. PWD officials confirmed that work on the portion of the road has been stopped on the forest department’s orders. “We have followed all guidelines. Such objections were not raised by the forest department earlier. However, the work on the stretch has been stopped after the notice,” said a PWD official aware of the project, asking not to be named. CM Kejriwal, this January, conducted a review meeting on the status of the road redesign project and directed officials to finish work by 2023. However, just days after initial work was started, the work was stopped, citing violations. These nine stretches include redesigning from Mayapuri to Moti Bagh; All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) to Ashram; Outer Ring Road from Nigambodh Ghat to Magzine Road crossing; Narwana Road – Mother Dairy to Panch Mahal Awas; Ambedkar Nagar to Defence Colony (BRT corridor); Road number 43 – Britania Chowk to the Outer Ring Road West Enclave; Wazirpur depot crossing (NSP) to Rithala Metro; from Moti Nagar Ring Road T-point to Pusa Road roundabout and Vikas Marg – Laxmi Nagar to Karkari Mor. The PWD official said the project aims not only at making streets look more appealing, but also envisions to make them more pedestrian and cycle friendly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhis-ambitious-road-revamp-plan-hits-green-ministry-roadblock-101616783910450.html
27-03-2021||India||Hand over Mukhtar Ansari to UP in 14 days: SC to Punjab||New Delhi The Supreme Court on Friday directed the Punjab government to hand over the custody of gangster-turned-politician Mukhtar Ansari, currently lodged in Rupnagar jail, to Uttar Pradesh Police within 14 days. Ansari, a BSP MLA from Mau constituency, is facing trial in 10 cases involving heinous crimes ranging from murder, extortion, cheating and fraud under the Gangster Act, in UP. In 2019, he was brought to Rupnagar jail in connection with an alleged extortion case in Mohali.The court’s directive came on a plea by the UP government seeking a direction to the Punjab government and Rupnagar jail authority to immediately hand over the custody of the legislator. The court, however, rejected the UP government’s plea, seeking transfer of the extortion case from Punjab to it. It also dismissed Ansari’s petition seeking transfer of cases filed in UP against him to some other place outside the state.A bench of Justices Ashok Bhushan and R Subhash Reddy directed the Punjab government to hand over the custody of Ansari to Banda jail authorities in UP. It further told Banda prison authorities to extend all medical facilities to the accused. “In our opinion, a convict or an undertrial prisoner, who disobeys the law of the land, cannot oppose his transfer from one prison to another… Courts are not to be a helpless bystander, when the rule of law is being challenged with impunity. In such situations, this court can exercise power under Article 142 of the Constitution of India to order transfer of prisoner from one prison to another,” the bench observed.“Custody is denied to the Police of Uttar Pradesh at every time on trivial grounds under guise of medical grounds by mentioning ordinary diseases,” the bench added. The UP government had earlier contended that Ansari had been “dodging” the judicial system and was continuing with his alleged illegal activities from Rupnagar district. The Yogi Adityanath-led government also alleged in the apex court that there is a “collusion” between Ansari and Punjab Police.Refuting the claims, the Amarinder Singh government raised questions over the maintainability of the plea filed by his UP counterpart. On March 4, it informed the top court that the UP government did not have the fundamental right to seek Ansari’s transfer.Since 2019, Ansari has not applied for a bail nor has Punjab Police filed a charge sheet in the case. Due to his stay in the Punjab prison, multiple trials pending against him before the Special MP/MLA court in Allahabad were adjourned on various occasions. The warrants issued by the UP courts were also not entertained by Punjab jail authorities citing the “ill health” of the accused.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hand-over-mukhtar-ansari-to-up-in-14-days-sc-to-punjab-101616783850570.html
27-03-2021||India||SC dismisses plea against sale of electoral bonds||The Supreme Court on Friday cleared the sale of the electoral bonds ahead of elections in West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Assam, Kerala and Puducherry finding no justification to block their sale over concerns of anonymity in political party funding or apprehensions of their misuse. The 10-day sale window will open, as scheduled, on April 1. Dismissing two stay applications moved by NGO Association for Democratic Reforms, filed in 2019 and earlier this month, a three-judge bench of the apex court headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde noted that the sale of these bonds, which began in January 2018, have continued “without any impediment” in 2018, 2019 and 2020. In April 2019, the Court introduced an interim “safeguard” by directing all political parties to submit details of receipts of the electoral bonds to the Election Commission in a sealed cover. This was done as an interim measure till the pending petitions challenging the validity of these electoral bonds were decided. With this order still in vogue, the bench, also comprising Justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian, said, “certain safeguards have already been provided by this Court in its interim order of April 12, 2019, (and) we do not see any justification for the grant of stay at this stage.” The Election Commission which supported the electoral bond policy in the top court said it has received sealed covers from various political parties (national, state, registered and unregistered) as per the April 12, 2019 order. The list of parties that submitted the covers were also furnished to the Court. Further, the court held that this interim arrangement will now remain and no applications for stay will be entertained every time the window for sale of electoral bonds is opened. ADR, in its application claimed that electoral bonds could be a channel for corporate bribes to be paid to political parties as a quid pro quo since the scheme envisaged anonymity for donors. The Centre, represented by Attorney General KK Venugopal submitted that the idea of introducing these bonds was to prevent black money holding sway over elections. In support of his concerns, ADR’s counsel Prashant Bhushan relied on a letter written by Reserve Bank of India (RBI) way back in September 2017 (before introduction of the scheme) expressing serious reservations over it. The bench, after examining a series of letters written by RBI concluded that much of the banking regulator’s concerns were addressed in the final version of the scheme. The judges noted that in one letter, RBI went to the extent of calling electoral bonds “an enduring reform consistent with the Government’s digitization push.” RBI’s only objection was to the issue of bonds in scrip form rather than in dematerialised (electronic) form. The bench held, “It is not correct to say that RBI and EC opposed the electoral bond scheme itself….RBI wanted to achieve the twin advantage of providing anonymity to the contributor and ensuring that consideration for transfers is through banking channels and not cash or other means. The concerns expressed by RBI to the form and not to the substance, cannot really advance the case of the petitioners.” Bhushan further alleged that the bond could be purchased by a person using white money and later transferred to somebody in black. The Court ruled out the scope of such a transaction as purchasers of bonds will have to comply with KYC norms and their identities are anyway known to the State Bank of India, which issues the bonds. If a company makes a donation through electoral bonds, the Companies Act requires financial statements of registered companies to be filed with the Registrar of Companies. Further, the scheme also mandates political parties to file audited statements of accounts each year with the Election Commission. “Therefore, it is not as though the operations under the scheme are behind iron curtains incapable of being pierced…All that is required is a little more effort to cull out such information from both side (purchaser of bond and political party) and do some `match the following’,” added the bench. Clause 14 of the Electoral Bond Scheme introduced by way of amendments to the Finance Act and Representation of Peoples Act in January 2018 specifically prohibits trading of bonds. The Court cited this clause to allay Bhushan’s fears of subsequent transfer of bonds. Welcoming the order, Bharatiya Janata Party spokesperson Nalin Kohli said: “Now that the honourable Supreme Court has decided in favour of the electoral bonds one hopes there will be closure to what was an unnecessary controversy on a good decision with regard to electoral funding.”Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala, however, termed the bonds a “dubious money laundering operation”. “SC must expose #ElectoralBonds for what they have become-: 1. A dubious money laundering operation to help one party. 2. A veiled mechanism to legitimize quid-pro-quo deals. 3. An untraceable funnel for black money payments. If not now, then when?,” he tweeted.ADR Founder Jagdeep Chhokar said, “The judgment is disappointing. The interim arrangement on which the Court has relied is unworkable. The EC cannot know the donors of these bonds received by political parties. Further, the Court has said that information about the donors can be known by making a little effort. if this information can be found then why can’t it be made available in public domain. We hope this order does not impact our petition pending on the larger questions of law challenging these bonds.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-dismisses-plea-against-sale-of-electoral-bonds-101616783791539.html
27-03-2021||India||Battle for the east kicks off in 1st phase of voting today||Kolkata/Guwahati: Kicking off this season of assembly elections, voters in two of India’s largest eastern states, West Bengal and Assam, in substantially tribal-dominated districts, will begin the process of electing their local representatives on Saturday, with major national and regional parties — the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the Congress, and Trinamool Congress (TMC) — engaged in an intense battle to win or retain power. The polls in Bengal will see Mamata Banerjee’s TMC attempt to defend its turf against a resurgent BJP, which won 18 of the 42 seats in the state in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections and has emerged as the primary challenger. In Assam, it is the BJP which is seeking to win retain power, as a coalition of the Congress and Badruddin Ajmal’s All India United Democratic Front challenge the Sarbananda Sonowal-led government. Political observers believe that the outcome in the elections in the east will determine if the BJP’s hegemony remains intact despite governance challenges in recent months, including due to the pandemic, or whether non-BJP forces are able to ensure a wider distribution of political power. It is also expected to shape the future of Centre-state relations, with the BJP campaigning on the idea of a “double engine growth” — of having the same party in power at both the Centre and in the two states — and non-BJP forces claiming that their victory is essential to check what they see as the BJP’s centralising and undemocratic alliances. Commenting on the significance of the polls, political scientist Neelanjan Sircar of Ashoka University and the Centre for Policy Research said, “The results of the Assam and West Bengal election will have major reverberations across India. The BJP has had a rough few months, with the farmers protests and publicity around a democratic breakdown. It is seeking a strong electoral performance in these states to change the narrative. This is why we have seen so many visits from senior BJP leaders to the region, particularly West Bengal, along with a very aggressive campaign. If on the other hand, the Congress can give a fight in Assam and the TMC wins against all odds, it will signal a new era of opposition with Mamata Banerjee as the most important opposition leader.” In Bengal, where polls are spread out over eight phases, voting will take place in 30 of the state’s 294 assembly seats in parts of five western districts — East Midnapore, West Midnapore, Purulia, Bankura and Jhargram, of which the last four are part of the Jangalmahal region. A hotbed of Communist Party of India (Maoist) activities in the final years of the Left Front regime, which lost power in 2011, Jangalmahal is home to the biggest chunk of the state’s tribal population. Bengal’s scheduled tribe (ST) population stood at 5.29 million during the 2011 census, accounting for about 5.8% of the total population. Banerjee is banking on her decision to create welfare boards for all major tribal communities such as the Santhals, Lodhas and Kurmis, and development projects, including new roads, hospitals, schools and polytechnic colleges. But the BJP, which did well in this region in the 2019 polls by winning five Lok Sabha seats, is banking on acute deprivation as well as tribal discontent against the TMC. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Union home minister Amit Shah and Banerjee have held back-to-back rallies over the past few weeks, promising jobs and development. To ensure peaceful polling on Saturday, the Election Commission has deployed 684 companies of central armed police forces. This region is also the political home of key BJP heavyweights, including state president Dilip Ghosh, who is an MP from West Midnapore, and Sisir Adhikari, father of Suvendu Adhikari — both father and son are new entrants to the BJP, with Adhikari senior winning from the Contai constituency of East Midnapore district in 2019.Both parties have, as is usual before polls, projected confidence. “We will sweep in the first phase. People will cast their votes in peace. They are with us,” Ghosh said on Friday. “I visited the region. We are ahead of others on the ground. The ruling party will do extremely well,” said TMC Lok Sabha member Saugata Roy. Kolkata-based political science professor and election analyst Udayan Bandopadhyay said, “The BJP performed very well in the Jangalmahal districts in 2019. The TMC’s fortune will depend on the amount of lost ground it has managed to recover since then.” Political scientist Sajjan Kumar, who has travelled to all the 294 constituencies of Bengal during his pre-election field research, said, “In the first phase, there is substantial SC, ST and OBC population with communities such as Bauri, Bagdi, Santhal and Mahto-Kurmis. This phase will show which way the Bengali Hindu subaltern vote will go, to the development-Hindutva pitch of the BJP or the welfare outreach of the Trinamool.” In Assam, 47 of the state’s 126 seats will go to polls on Saturday. Most of these seats are in the tea-rich districts of Upper Assam. The tea-tribe community, which comprises tea garden workers and former workers and their families, accounts for 17% of Assam’s population and its vote plays a decisive role in 35-40 seats. Because of the high number of seats and usually en masse voting by the tea-tribe community, the outcome of the first phase is crucial in determining which party or alliance will form the next government in the state. Considered a traditional Congress bastion in the past, in recent years, the BJP has been able to make inroads in the tea-tribe community with promise of scheduled tribe (ST) status, many welfare schemes for women, students, young people, and development projects such as the construction of roads, hospitals and schools in tea gardens. The BJP has also given representation to leaders of the community, and, currently , two Lok Sabha MPs and one Rajya Sabha MP from Assam are from the community. One of them, Rameshwar Teli, is a minister in the Modi Cabinet. But despite its promise in 2016, the BJP hasn’t been able to give ST status to the community and increase daily wages of tea garden workers to ₹351. The Congress is trying to win back support of the community by promising to increase daily wages of tea garden workers to ₹365 if it comes to power. While the BJP is contesting 39 of the 47 seats in the first phase, its ally Asom Gana Parishad will contest in 10 seats (there is what is being called a “friendly contest” between the allies in two seats). The Congress will contest in 43 seats and newly formed Assam Jatiya Parishad in 41 seats. In 2016, the BJP-AGP combine won 35 of the 47 seats, and the BJP alone won 27 seats — close to half of its total strength of 60 seats in 2016. The Congress won just seven seats.“The BJP-AGP combine will win 42 of the 47 seats in the first phase,” predicted senior Assam minister Himanta Biswa Sarma on Thursday. BJP state president Ranjeet Kumar Dass earlier said that the party will also win several of the seven seats won by the Congress in 2016. The Congress expressed confidence that it will be able to drub the BJP-AGP combine in the first phase this time. “In 2016, the BJP and AGP dominated these seats. But in this election, the results will get reversed. The Congress will win around 30 plus seats in the first phase and will come to power with our allies,” Congress state president Ripun Bora said. Commenting on the significance of the first phase, Akhil Ranjan Dutta, professor of political science in Gauhati University said: “The BJP promised to grant ST status to six communities in 2016. Five of them, Tai-Ahom, tea-tribes, Maran, Muttock and Chutia, have a sizeable presence in the seats that are in the first phase. The party wasn’t able to fulfil that promise. The BJP is now focussed on [issues such as ] a clash of civilisation and a cultural threat of Assamese identity with the idea of polarising voters. The party has been able to penetrate the tea-tribe vote bank, but during this campaign, the Congress has been to regain some trust of this community. The poll outcome in the first phase could spring some surprises.” Political scientist Sajjan Kumar said: “In Assam, the electoral significance of the issue of NRC-CAA will be tested as the poll-bound districts have been the hotbed of the Khilonjia (son of the soil) sentiment until recently. It will be a crucial test whether the BJP can override the Khilonjia factor by their successful coalescing of non-Ahom communities, the general Assamese, the tea tribes, the Gorkhas, the Indigenous tribes (Kacharis, Bodos, Mising, Doley etc.) against the anti-CAA pitch of the Ahom leadership, of the Congress, Raijor Dal (Akhil Gogoi) and Assam Jantiya Parishad (AGP), a breakaway group from the AGP.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/battle-for-the-east-kicks-off-in-1st-phase-of-voting-today-101616783670380.html

See pictures||Authorities in Maharashtra’s Nanded and Beed on Friday imposed lockdown measures in the worst-affected districts of the state as cases of the coronavirus disease surged in these areas. "It was suggested to allow local administration to impose localised lockdowns instead of imposing lockdown across the state,” Reuters quoted an official as saying after a cabinet meeting to assess the situation of Covid-19 in the state.Click here for complete coverage of Covid-19The complete lockdown in Beed and Nanded will begin on Friday and is expected to last till April 4, if no further extensions are announced. Images from the area show deserted vegetable markets, roads, streets and bus stations as the district went under lockdown on March 26.Maharashtra has been reporting the highest number of coronavirus disease cases in the country. Maharashtra contributes most to the active coronavirus disease caseload of the country, according to the Union ministry of health and family welfare. India on Friday reported nearly 60,000 Covid-19 cases in the past 24 hours and more than half of them were registered in Maharashtra.Other districts in the state have also imposed restrictions to control the rising coronavirus infections. Market, hotels and restaurants will be closed on the festival of Holi on March 29 in Nagpur, one of the districts with the highest number of active cases in the country. There are more than 35,000 active coronavirus disease cases in the district, the health ministry data showed. Essential shops for vegetables, mutton, chicken etc in Nagpur will be allowed to be open till 1pm on the day of the festival. Gathering of people and any celebration is prohibited on March 28 to 29, news agency ANI reported municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B as saying.Earlier in the week, the country has also reported the presence of a double mutant strain of the virus and other variants of concern, however, the correlation between the strains and rising infections is yet to be established.In the wake of the rising Covid-19 cases, various restrictions have also been imposed in parts of the country ahead of festivals to contain the spread of the deadly disease.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtras-beed-locks-down-till-april-4-over-covid-19-cases-see-pictures-101616752901508.html
27-03-2021||India||Five charts that explain the upcoming elections||The Election Commission of India (ECI) on February 26 announced the schedule of assembly elections in four states – Assam, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal – and the union territory of Puducherry. These polls will be held from March 27 to April 29 in eight phases. The results of the elections will be declared on May 2. Here are five charts which explain the forthcoming contest.The electorate’s profileThree out of the four states going to polls; Assam, West Bengal and Kerala are also the top three states by share of Muslims in the population. With 26.7% Muslims and 16.6% Christians, Kerala has the lowest share of Hindus -- to be sure, they are still a majority – among India’s important states. In terms of social composition, Other Backward Classes (OBCs) have a much bigger share in the southern states than West Bengal and Assam. While more than a third of West Bengal’s population is made up of Scheduled Castes (SCs), Scheduled Tribes (STs) have at least a 15% share in Assam’s population.Can the BJP finally make inroads on the east coast?The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has gained a foothold, even captured power in many new regions after its 2014 success. India’s north-eastern states and Haryana are the biggest examples of this. However, one region where the BJP has still not been able to achieve success at the level of assemblies is India’s eastern coast. From West Bengal to Tamil Nadu, the BJP’s seat share in assemblies is among the lowest in India. After having won more than 40% vote share in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections in West Bengal and stitched an alliance with the ruling All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) in Tamil Nadu, the BJP is hoping to capture power on the eastern coast for the first time.Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Assam are very crucial for the CongressThe states of Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Assam account for 13% out of the 543 seats in Lok Sabha. However, these three states accounted for 50% in the 52 Lok Sabha seats the Congress won in the 2019 elections. This one statistic captures the importance of this election cycle for the Congress. While the Congress is a junior partner of the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) in Tamil Nadu, it is the leader of the United Democratic Front (UDF) in Kerala and is allying for the first time with the All-India United Democratic Front (AIUDF), a party with mostly Muslim supporters, in Assam. The Assam alliance is a calculated risk as it could alienate the non-Muslim supporters of the Congress. A simple addition of Congress and AIUDF vote shares since 2014 Lok Sabha elections shows that its reach has anyway been coming down.Can the DMK and AITC retain their dominant regional party positions?One of the defining features of post-2014 politics in India has been the decline of Congress, Left parties and Mandal based formation in the states of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. West Bengal and Tamil Nadu have emerged as an important source of anti-BJP MPs in the Lok Sabha. DMK and the All India Trinamool Congress (AITC) are the biggest parties after the Congress which consistently oppose the BJP in the parliament. Their combined strength of 45 is just seven less than that of the Congress. While the AITC suffered serious reverses in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections – its seat tally came down from 34 to 22 – the DMK led alliance swept Tamil Nadu winning 38 out of the 39 seats. Their performance in these elections will have important implications for their status not just in the states but also in national politics.It is do or die for the CPI (M) in KeralaIf the Communist Party of India (Marxist) or the CPI(M) led Left Democratic Front (LDF) fails to retain the state of Kerala, it will mark a new low in the Left’s declining fortunes in Indian politics. Ever since it captured power in West Bengal in 1977, the CPI(M) has always led a state government in West Bengal, Kerala and Tripura since then. With the CPI(M) staring at irrelevance in West Bengal and marginalisation in Tripura, Kerala is the only bastion left. To be sure, Kerala has alternated between the LDF and UDF since 1980. The LDF’s rout in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections -- it won just one of the 20 Lok Sabha seats -- suggested an imminent defeat for the CPI (M) in 2021.
