In this case, he is not ready to provide details of the victim or her family. More importantly, the victim or her family has not made allegations so far,” the officer added.An unverified video of a man resembling the minister with an unnamed woman has gone viral with TV news channels in Karnataka playing the incident on loop. The social activist had claimed that the minister had sought sexual for favours from the victim.After the footage went viral, Ramesh Jarkihol resigned from the cabinet on Wednesday.The police’s inability to identify the woman in the sex tape involving Jarkiholi, could mean that he could be the fifth politician to get a clean-chit in a sex scandal in the state.In the last two decades, the state witnessed at least five politicians facing the heat over alleged sex tapes featuring them becoming public. While sex scandals have been instrumental in creating a controversy in the state, no political careers have been affected by them. Four politicians involved in such scandals before Jarkiholi got clean chits, continued in politics and returned to powerful positions.BJP legislator Arvind Limbavali (2019), HY Meti, then excise minister in the Congress government (2016), Hartal Halappa, a close aide of BS Yediyurappa (2010) and BJP MLA Renukachary (2007) had court controversy over leaked tapes. While in the case of Limbavali and HY Meti, the probe could not verify the authenticity of the tapes, Halappa was acquitted by a court in a sexual assault case. In the case of Renukacharya, the victim withdrew the complaint lodged against the legislator.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/complainant-fails-to-join-probe-against-karnataka-ex-minister-ramesh-jarkiholi-101614878403700.html

A smart city is about urban rejuvenation, governance, accountability, and ease of living,” he was quoted as saying by news agency ANI. The Union minister also hailed the smart cities project as one of the fastest implemented projects anywhere in the world. He, however, said, “there is some kind of perception deficit.” Also Read| Bengaluru, Shimla best cities to live: See top 10 in Ease of Living Index 2020Earlier in the day, the minister released the rankings under EoLI 2020 for cities with a population of more than a million and cities with less than a million people. A total of 111 cities participated in the assessment exercise that was conducted in 2020, the housing and urban affairs ministry said in a statement. Bengaluru ranked as the top performer followed by Pune, Ahmedabad, Chennai, Surat, and Navi Mumbai. Coimbatore, Vadodara, Indore, and Greater Mumbai were next in line in the more than a million category. Of the 49 cities ranked on the liveability index in this category, Delhi figured at the 13th spot while Srinagar was ranked lowest.In the less than million category, Shimla was ranked the highest in ease of living, followed by Bhubaneswar, Silvassa, Kakinada, Salem, Vellore, Gandhinagar, Gurugram, Davanagere, and Tiruchirappalli.According to MPI 2020 ranking, municipalities with a population of over a million, Indore ranked the highest followed Surat and Bhopal. In the less than million category, New Delhi Municipal Council has emerged as the leader, followed by Tirupati and Gandhinagar. Puri earlier in the day said, “India’s steady economic growth is reflected in the rapid expansion of her cities. India, today is one of the fastest-growing large economies in the world. With the current urbanisation rate, India is expected to have 50 per cent of the country’s population residing in cities within the next 30 years.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/choice-between-smart-city-and-decay-hardeep-puri-after-release-of-ease-of-living-index-report-101614876460105.html

Like all other essential services, media houses also remained open during the whole calamity," the press body said.It said that the Association has welcomed the "groundbreaking steps" of vaccinating all those who are fighting the COVID-19 pandemic".  "The Association took note and highly appreciated that for the first time the government has sanctioned ₹5 lakh each to the family members of journalists who died of COVID-19 during the pandemic all over the country," it said.During the meeting, the Press Association also urged the PIB to revive the railways concessions to the accredited journalists, which has been discontinued during the pandemic, and said that the journalists travel in trains while on professional duty.

ArcelorMittal, which is controlled by billionaire Lakshmi Mittal, has previously tried to set up a steel plant in Odisha.It had to scrap that original plan for a 12 million-tonne-a-year steel plant after the company failed to acquire the requisite land for the facility and failed to secure approval for an iron ore mine that would provide raw materials.Other industrial ventures have struggled to take off due to bureaucratic delays that have undermined India's investment appeal and slowed growth in Asia's third-largest economy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/arcelormittal-nippon-steel-india-plans-6-88-billion-steel-plant-101614874796108.html

When this law was introduced an impact assessment was not made. Why can’t it be done now,” said the bench, also comprising Justices L Nageswara Rao, BR Gavai, AS Bopanna and S Ravindra Bhat.The apex court referred to Article 247 which clothes Parliament with the power to create additional courts for the better administration of laws. “We want you (Centre) to exercise your power (under Article 247). A temporary legislation can be made for creating additional courts or you may appoint retired judges,” the bench observed.On Wednesday, the Centre had submitted a note prepared by Department of Financial Services (DFS) which did not agree with the Court’s suggestion to create additional courts as a solution to curb high pendency of Section 138 cases. Instead, it argued that the backlog occurred due to delay in ensuring the presence of the accused for trial.The Court was not happy with the note. By an order, the Court sought the presence of the Solicitor General Tushar Mehta and observed, “Prima facie we are of the view that the aforesaid Article 247 (of Constitution of India) confers a power coupled with duty on the Union of India to establish additional courts, for better administration of laws made by Parliament. There is no doubt or dispute about the fact that matters under the N.I Act have posed what by now has become an intractable problem, accounting for close to 30 to 40 per cent of the pendency in the trial courts and a very high percentage in High Courts.”Mehta appeared on Thursday and agreed that the suggestions given by Court were welcome but would require wide-ranging consultations at the highest level. The Court posted the matter for hearing on March 10 giving time to Mehta to come back with a response.In October 2020, the Supreme Court received a preliminary report prepared by Court-appointed amici curiae senior advocate Sidharth Luthra and advocate K Parameshwar who delved deep into the issue and suggested systemic reforms in the judicial processes involved at the executive and judicial level. Setting up additional courts was one of the steps proposed for reforms. The Act prescribes a six-month deadline for completion of trial in Section 138 cases but such cases clog the judicial docket for more than three years, the amici curiae report suggested. The amici curiae suggested summary trial of cases, mediation and attachment of property to the extent of the cheque amount as other measures to expedite trial of cases under the N.I Act.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-suggests-law-to-create-more-courts-to-clear-pendency-of-cheque-bounce-cases-101614873835711.html

He claimed that there are more than 210 communities identified as SEBCs in Odisha.Pradhan said the state government should go ahead with the available data and implement the reservation for the SEBC in public employment and educational institutions.He said this is not a political issue, rather a mode of providing social justice and economic empowerment to a large population of people in the state.The Union minister also alleged that the state government has also not implemented the 10 per cent reservation for economically poor people belonging to the general category.Chairperson of OSCBC Raghunath Biswal on Monday held a meeting to assess the preparedness for undertaking the much- awaited survey. The final data of the survey is expected to be available on June 11, an official said.However, Odisha Law Minister Pratap Jena replied back asking the Union Minister as to who constituted the OBC commission in the state. "Please do not indulge in politics on the OBC reservation issue." Jena said.Senior BJD lawmaker S R Patnaik said the state government is committed to the welfare of the people under the OBC category. "The commission will soon start the survey and the findings will be known soon within 45 days. Let us wait for the completion of the survey," Patnaik said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-govt-has-data-on-number-of-people-under-obc-category-dharmendra-pradhan-101614870649967.html
04-03-2021||India||SII writes to PMO proposing reforms in drug regulatory system||The world's largest vaccine manufacturer by volume, Serum Institute of India, has written to the Prime Minister's Office proposing reforms in the existing drug regulatory system, including allowing manufacturing and stockpiling of non-Covid vaccines while undergoing clinical trial.In the letter, Prakash Kumar Singh, the Director of Government and Regulatory Affairs at the Pune-based Serum Institute of India (SII) referred to the Health Ministry's May 18, 2020, gazette notification, saying it allowed manufacturing and stockpiling of Covid-19 vaccine under clinical trial for marketing authorization for sale or distribution."Because of this rule, it became possible for us to manufacture and stockpile the Covid-19 vaccine during the clinical trial and we could make the vaccine available in such a short span of time to protect millions of lives," he said in the letter dated March 2.By the end of 2020, SII has already produced around 50 million dosages of the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine 'Covishield', even while it awaited the Drugs Controller General of India's (DCGI) nod for emergency use of its vaccine in the country.It got the nod in early January this year."In view of the successful result of this provision for Covid-19 vaccine, this provision should also be implemented for non-Covid-19 vaccines," Singh said.In the letter to the PMO, he also sought permission to use the remaining quantities of batches of Covid and non-Covid vaccines for commercial purpose which have been used in a clinical trial.In this context, he said the Health Ministry had issued draft rules dated April 12, 2018, to allow the remaining quantities of batches of vaccines which have been used in a clinical trial for commercial use after the grant of permission in Form 46 (now it is Form CT-23) and manufacturing licence in Form 28D."However, this draft rule has not been implemented till now. This draft rule should be implemented shortly to avoid wastage of life-saving vaccines," Singh pointed out.Singh also sought implementation of recommendations of a high-powered inter-ministerial committee for reforming the Drug Regulatory Systems in India.The letter stated that on the directions of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, a high-powered inter-ministerial committee for reforming the Drug Regulatory Systems in India was constituted on May 11 last year under the chairmanship of then officer on special duty Rajesh Bhushan, who is presently the union health secretary."A series of meetings of this committee was held starting May 2020. Recommendations of this inter-ministerial committee should be implemented immediately in line with the ease of doing business" he said.Singh's letter highlighted a few other points also related to regulatory reforms and said, "We are putting forward the following points with relation to necessary regulatory reforms in the existing Drug Regulatory system for your kind reference and intervention, which will take the vaccine industry of our country to new heights in the world."Singh also lauded the prime minister's vision mentioning, "It is a matter of great pride for all of us that because of our Hon'ble Prime Minister's vision about the regulatory reforms, the vaccine industry of our country is growing very fast and under his global leadership, our country has proved that we are the world leader in vaccine sector."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sii-writes-to-pmo-proposing-reforms-in-drug-regulatory-system-101614869554266.html
04-03-2021||India||Military leaders will have to match political vision behind theaterisation: CDS||India’s military leadership will have to “more than match the political vision” that has mandated the creation of theatre commands to address future security threats, chief of defence staff General Bipin Rawat said on Thursday, while highlighting the need to stay prepared to counter threats from China and Pakistan, even as he stressed that the former seeks to “establish dominance” in the country’s neighbourhood and the Indian Ocean Region.Rawat said “service parochialism” will have to make way for “a combined services outlook” to take theaterisation forward, calling for the military’s transformation to “outthink and outfight” India’s adversaries.“It will not be easy and the transition to theatre commands will indeed be a challenging process. There is a need to create and propagate the narrative of strategic advantages that accrue at the national and armed forces levels (with theaterisation),” CDS said on the eve of a top commanders’ conference to be addressed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on March 6.Theaterisation refers to placing specific units of the army, the navy and the air force under a theatre commander. Such commands are led by an officer from any of the three services, depending on the roles assigned to them.The military is putting finishing touches to its theaterisation plan for the most advantageous utilisation of its resources to fight future wars, with the Air Defence Command and the Maritime Theatre Command set to be launched by May.Rawat said integrating operating concepts seeks to create the conditions to “outthink, outfight and outpace” India’s adversaries. He was speaking at a virtual event - Transformation: Imperatives for the Indian Armed Forces - organised by the Secunderabad-based College of Defence Management.“Such seminars are expected to generate ideas about evolving joint structures that will address voids at the strategic and operational levels that single-service commands at present fail to address,” Rawat said. He said the military currently has 17 single-service commands, none co-located with each other and with each of the three services discharging their operational and strategic roles in isolation -- "a marked lack of synergy in operations".The points raised by CDS are extremely relevant, said former Northern Army commander Lieutenant General DS Hooda (retd).“We cannot continue with 17 individual commands while paying lip-service to integration and joint war fighting. The three services will have to look beyond their stovepipes and work with CDS to find the best model and optimum command and control arrangement for integrated commands that is suitable for India,” Hooda added.Apart from the Air Defence and Maritime Theatre Commands, India is expected to have three other integrated commands to secure its western, northern and eastern fronts - these will be rolled out by December 2022. In addition, a logistics command is in the works to avoid duplication of efforts and resources.CDS’s mandate includes bringing about jointness in operations, logistics, transport, training, support services and repairs and maintenance of the three services.“Theatre commands will optimise resource utilisation and lead to savings that can be used for force modernisation,” Rawat said. The military is expected to make a presentation to the PM on the situation along the borders and progress made towards the creation of theatre commands at the Combined Commanders’ Conference being held at Kevadia in Gujarat on March 5-6.Rawat said the Indian armed forces face greater challenges than any other military in the world and India urgently needs to bring about structural reforms in higher defence and operational organisations.“Some important steps that we need to take include defining the national security strategy, higher defence strategic guidance, and structural reforms in higher defence and operational organisations.”Rawat also spoke about remodelling organisational structures to fight future battles.“The organisational structure for conventional wars or limited conflicts under nuclear overhang already exists. But it needs to be re-modelled, re-equipped and re-oriented to conduct joint battles in digitised battle space to have necessary flexibility for other types of operations,” he said.CDS said the main dimensions of the military’s transformation relate to doctrine, force structure, technology, sustenance and readiness. Referring to the border standoff in eastern Ladakh, he said, “We stood up to our belligerent neighbour on the northern borders and thwarted its nefarious design. Now, more than ever, military transformation is vital to us.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/military-leaders-will-have-to-match-political-vision-behind-theaterisation-cds-101614869810785.html

Recently in the USA, the polls were conducted on ballot papers, and counting took several days. People trust only ballot papers, but this fight cannot be fought right now," he said at a press conference.Yadav also talked about the Bihar elections stating that the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD)-Congress-Left grand alliance was going to win but the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) did not let that happen, stating that things won’t work like that in UP where his party is confident of winning the elections with a huge majority."In UP, the situation will not be like Bihar assembly polls. In Bihar, the grand alliance government was going to be formed, but BJP did not let it happen. In UP, the BJP will taste defeat by a huge margin. The SP will win 350 seats (of a total 403 seats)," Yadav said at the press conference held in Jhansi.Yadav launched a similar attack against EVMs during the 2019 Lok Sabha elections citing news clippings on malfunctioning of EVMs. He alleged that EVMs were "malfunctioning or voting for the BJP" across the country, adding that poll officers are untrained to operate the machines.“EVMs across India malfunctioning or voting for the BJP. DMs say poll officials untrained to operate EVMs. 350+ being replaced. This is criminal negligence for a polling exercise that costs 50,000 crs,” Yadav had tweeted on April 23, 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-abolish-evms-if-sp-comes-to-power-in-up-in-2022-says-akhilesh-yadav-101614868828639.html

However, the cities from West Bengal could not be incorporated due to data challenges,” the report stated.A total of 111 cities participated in the assessment exercise that was conducted in 2020.Even though this year’s report at least mentions the name of West Bengal while claiming that there was no data from the state and the report only carries a picture of a metro railway track, the previous reports of 2018 and 2019 didn’t even mention the name of Kolkata or West Bengal. No data was shared in 2018 and 2019 either.Among Indian cities with a population of over a million, the ease of living is the highest in Bengaluru, Pune and Ahmedabad. It was found to be the lowest in Bareilly, Dhanbad and Srinagar. Shimla topped the category of cities with a population of less than million.Launched in 2018, the ranking has assumed importance over the years in shaping government policies and determining expenditure priorities. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been emphasizing the ease of living along with the ease of doing business as a key policy priority.Calls to both the state urban development minister Firhad Hakim and the state urban development secretary Khalil Ahmed went unanswered. They didn’t respond to messages either.“This is not a path breaking or important survey. Hence the name of West Bengal not appearing in the survey is not a serious matter. The government may not have the time to send data,” said Saugata Roy, TMC MP.This is, however, not the first time that the name of West Bengal has surfaced for not sharing data with the Centre. The National Crime Record Bureau report released on September 30, 2020 said that West Bengal did not send the data to NCRB within the deadline.“Due to non-receipt of data from the state of West Bengal and Kolkata city in time for the year 2019, data furnished for the year 2018 has been used to arrive at national and city-wise figures,” the NCRB report had said.While a tussle has been going on between the BJP–led Union government and TMC-led state government, Union ministers, including Amit Shah, had on several occasions during election campaign attacked the TMC-led government in the state for not sharing data of farmers for the PM Kisan Samman Nidhi which would have allowed farmers in West Bengal to receive financial aid from the Centre.The TMC had, however, brushed aside the allegations saying that the Centre was not sending the names of farmers as a result of which data could not be shared.“We are fortunate that the TMC hasn’t claimed so far that West Bengal tops the list of ease of living. I am sure that with elections approaching they will do it any day, claiming that ease of living is highest in West Bengal. The Mamata Banerjee administration didn’t send any data to NCRB because it knew that law and order has deteriorated, and violence has shot up. It hasn’t sent any data to for ease of living index because the state government knows that it would come last,” said Samik Bhattacharya, BJP spokesperson.Earlier in May 2020, an inter-ministerial central team (IMCT) sent to assess West Bengal’s response to Covid-19 had alleged discrepancies in the data provided by the state, pointed to its high mortality rate, and questioned the state government’s claim of having surveyed five million people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lack-of-data-makes-bengal-lone-state-which-didn-t-appear-in-ease-of-living-index-101614863297174.html

In the brief letter, Midhun Shah, who is also the state co-coordinator of the Kerala State Youth Commission, pointed out that the model code of conduct was already in force in the southern state, where Assembly election is scheduled on April 6. "The certificate, issued for receiving the free Covid-19 vaccine in the state, carries photo of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and excerpts of his speech. As it may influence the election procedure, I request you to take necessary steps to remove it," he said. Shah later said that the complaint was lodged based on the provisional certificate which he got after receiving the shot at a vaccination centre here this morning. "As the state-coordinator of the Youth Commission, I received the first dose of the vaccine this morning. I was surprised to see the Prime Minister's colour photo and wordings in it. I feel it is a violation of model code of conduct and so approached the EC seeking its removal," he told PTI. The EC had on Wednesday directed all petrol outlets and other agencies to remove hoardings advertising central government schemes and carrying images of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, from the premises within 72 hours, citing violation of the model code of conduct.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ec-petitioned-to-remove-pm-s-photo-from-covid-19-vaccine-certificate-101614867756234.html

If the law will be presented with a specific term like ‘love jihad,’ then we will discuss it,” Chautala, the deputy chief minister of the northern state, was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.If the law will be to check on forceful religious conversions, our party will definitely support it.

04-03-2021||India||Union minister Dharmendra Pradhan nudges Odisha to implement 27% OBC quota||Union petroleum minister Dharmendra Pradhan on Thursday urged the Odisha government to increase reservation for OBCs in public employment and reserve seats for OBCs/SEBCs in educational and technical institutions in the state before conducting a survey of the social and educational conditions of backward classes.“Backward classes constitute a considerable portion of the total population of Odisha. There are more than 210 communities identified as SEBCs (Socially and Educationally Backward Classes) in Odisha. Most of them are suffering from the twin curses of poverty and illiteracy,” Pradhan said at a press conference.Odisha’s commission for backward castes recently announced that it would begin a survey of backward classes people based on the social and educational status from May 1 and publish the final list in June.Pradhan said the central government has provided 27% reservation to OBCs in government jobs as well as in educational institutions-a welfare measure upheld by the Supreme Court. "However, after more than 30 years of implementation of said reservations, it is difficult to decipher why the Odisha government is not providing any such reservations to OBCs in public employment or in educational institutions and to SEBCs in educational institutions. The current move for enumeration of SEBCs comes across as a dichotomous and dilatory step trying to mask the extant policies of the Odisha government denying reservations for OBCs and SEBCs categories," he said.In 2008, Odisha had announced 27% reservation for the OBC/SEBC category in government jobs apart from the ST (22.5 %) and SC (16.25%) categories. But it was first struck down by the State Administrative Tribunal and later the High Court upheld the order in 2017 as it violated the SC order on capping the total reservation at not more than 50%. The government in 2014 through an executive order reduced the SEBC quota in government jobs from 27% to 11.25%.However, there is no reservation for OBCs/SEBCs either in colleges or technical institutions and medical colleges.Pradhan said he had written at least three letters to chief minister Naveen Patnaik Patnaik requesting for 27% reservation for socially and economically backward classes in government jobs and educational institutions in Odisha, but those have remained unaddressed.And despite the Supreme Court cap on quota, Pradhan went on to claim, “The state government has enough power to enact law in the Assembly to exceed the 50% reservation cap. The government is already sitting over an SEBC list. Who is stopping it from giving reservation?”Meanwhile, the backward class commission headed by former judge Raghunath Biswal has made elaborate arrangements for the survey. While 20,000 anganwadi workers would act as enumerators, over 7,000 nodal officers would supervise the survey at gram panchayats. Besides, supervisors will be deputed at block and district levels. Instead of moving from door-to-door, the enumerators would collect the necessary data from fair price shops through offline mode. The numerators will seek education details as well as economic conditions during the survey. People can also log into a website and register their details using their Aadhaar cards for authentication.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/union-minister-dharmendra-pradhan-nudges-odisha-to-implement-27-obc-quota-101614866855430.html

Dushyant Dave, appearing for the Punjab government, said criminal proceedings against Ansari have been going on the Uttar Pradesh for 15 years and the present writ petition of Uttar Pradesh is "not maintainable".Dave told the bench of justices Ashok Bhushan and R S Reddy that Ansari is unwell and central government-run PGI Chandigarh has been giving medical certificates to him from time to time. He added that response of Punjab government has been based on medical records.He said that this matter is of very serious nature and would open the Pandora's Box if the plea of Uttar Pradesh is allowed as this would lead to a situation in future, when states would come to the apex court against each other.Ansari's lawyer Mukul Rohatgi said UP government has no "fundamental right" to seek Ansari's transfer from Ropar prison to a district jail in Banda.Rohatgi said that because of his political affiliation to a party in opposition, he is being targeted.“My co-accused in a case was encountered. Uttar Pradesh has an axe to grind against Punjab and the court should not allow its shoulders to be used to fire a gun. This should not be allowed,” Rohatgi said.The lawyer also said that Ansari has been appearing in all courts through video conferencing so the arguments that trials are being stalled are "bogus".Rohatgi also sought transfer of cases outside Uttar Pradesh citing political vendetta.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for Uttar Pradesh government, said that the court can order Ansari's transfer to Banda jail under Article 142 as around 14 and 15 cases are at final stages.Mehta also said that Ansari has flouted the jail manual rules and right of the victim and the state at large cannot be overlooked and the accused cannot be allowed to jettison the fair trial.Ansari is lodged in district jail Ropar in Punjab in connection with an alleged extortion case since January 2019. He is also accused in several cases of heinous crimes lodged in Uttar Pradesh. He is a sitting member of the UP Legislative Assembly and has 10 cases ranging from murder, extortion, cheating and fraud to those under the Gangster Act against him in the state.During earlier hearing, the Uttar Pradesh government told the apex court that the Punjab government is "shamelessly" protecting Ansari.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/punjab-opposes-up-govt-plea-in-sc-seeking-mukhtar-ansari-s-transfer-101614866148148.html

It also wanted the EC to direct the police to register an FIR against him for "inciting the youth to another freedom struggle."BJP state in-charge, election liaison committee, V Balachandran, alleged that Gandhi's campaign in St.Joseph's Matric Higher Secondary School in Mulagumoodu in Kanyakumari district on March 1 was akin to an election campaign in school premises.In a memorandum submitted to chief electoral officer (CEO) Satyabrata Sahoo on Thursday he said Gandhi's political campaign in the educational institution violated provisions of the model code of conduct for which strict action including "prohibitory orders for his poll campaign in Tamil Nadu is required." Further, the Congress leader committed offences under sections 109 (punishment for abetment) and 124 A (sedition) of the IPC for his remarks that India now needs another freedom struggle, it said.Quoting Rahul Gandhi during his interaction with students, the memorandum said, "the Congress leaders comparison of the current situation with that of pre-Independence during the British rule and inciting the youth for another freedom struggle has been made with the intent to cause hatred, contempt and excite disaffection towards the government established by laws."While answering a question, Gandhi had replied, "there is lot of anger being spread in the country, lot of fear, and that is what we have to fight.We have to fight the division, anger, fear and once again make India happy, comfortable, fearless and united," it said.His statement violates sections 124 A of the IPC, Balachandran claimed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/restrain-rahul-gandhi-from-campaigning-in-tamil-nadu-bjp-plea-to-eci-101614864996629.html

04-03-2021||India||'Discriminatory': Goa in Supreme Court on mining leases renewal cancellation||Goa not getting the benefit of second renewal in mining leases when other states have the same advantage will amount to discrimination, the coastal state has told the Supreme Court. The mining industry in the state came to a standstill in March 2018, after the top court quashed the second renewal of 88 iron ore mining leases.“There are second renewals granted although they were not renewed for a number of years. As far as the state of Goa is concerned, the benefit of 2nd renewal, which is available and granted to the rest of the country, is denied. This would amount to discrimination and a judgment of the court cannot be interpreted to give such absurd and unequal treatment to different states under the same law,” said the Goa government seeking review of the Supreme Court order.The state government has told the apex court that its mining leases are eligible for renewal till 2037. The mining leaseholders have also claimed that leases in Goa were eligible for a ‘second renewal’, an opportunity they claim they were not provided.In a February 2018 order, the top court cancelled 88 active mining leases in Goa that were 'hurriedly' issued and reiterated that the leases had 'expired' in 2007 and if mining is to restart, fresh leases need to be issued. It dealt a blow to mining as the grant of fresh leases now needs to be done via auction, something that the state government and Goa's mining leaseholders are reluctant to agree to.Mining leases in Goa granted by the erstwhile Portuguese regime were converted to leases under the MMDR Act via the Goa Daman and Diu Mining Concessions (Abolition and Conversion Leases) Act, 1987 with effect from 1961, the year Goa was made part of India.The period from 1961 onwards was considered the grant of the lease whereas the period from 1987 was considered the ‘first renewal’ which was valid till 2007. Goa’s mining leaseholders applied for ‘second renewals’ in 2007 but the State government didn’t act on the applications instead allowing the leases to continue to operate on a ‘deemed extension’ basis which the Supreme Court in 2014 declared as illegal. The Supreme Court ruled that since the Goa government didn’t renew the leases in 2007 they were now ‘dead’ and were not eligible for belated renewals and instead fresh leases would have to be granted.Parallely, the state government has also claimed that the law as amended in 2015 provides that all active leases granted before the commencement of the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Amendment Act, 2015 shall be deemed to have been granted for a period of fifty years. This, they say, would mean Goa’s mining leases which were converted to leases in 1987 should be “deemed to have been granted for a period of 50 years” which makes them valid till 2037.The mining Industry has been one of the major sources of revenue generation for the state and also a source of employment generation, the Goa government said.“More than 17% of the population of the state of Goa is directly or indirectly dependent on the mining industry... Direct revenue loss to the state is estimated to the extent of minimum ₹600 crore on an annual basis. The loss of income, employment and closure of other forms of peripheral economy which thrive on mining activity cannot be quantified at this stage, but can be expected to be annually in the range of Rs. 240 Crore,” the state government said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/discriminatory-goa-in-supreme-court-on-mining-leases-renewal-cancellation-101614862402389.html

It is for the first time that Kinnars are participating in the mahakumbh at Haridwar.Earlier, the transgender seers were not allowed to take part in royal procession or royal baths. This year's fair is setting a new precedent giving transgender seers an opportunity to take part in Kumbh rituals. They had participated in Ardh Kumbh at Prayagraj in 2019.A large number of transgender Akhada seers are arriving in Haridwar these days amid grand reception.Mahamandaleshwar Tina Maa said permission by Shri Panch Dashnam Juna Akhada, one of the biggest akhadas, to allow Kinnar seers to take part in Peshwayi and subsequently next month in the sacred Ganga dip ritual along with them will shine a global spotlight on them.Acharya Mahamandaleshwar Laxmi Narayan Tripathi, the highest pontiff of Kinnar Akhada, said that with changing times societal norms are also changing and so is the mass acceptability of transgenders.“Kinnars have centuries old tradition of being guardians of art and culture; we have been associated for thousands of years with society customs, traditions, rituals and history. Now, Mahakumbh fair is providing us global identity, respect and recognition. Transgenders are now taking up education and the government should provide us with more amenities. Transgender community also needs to explore avenues in politics,” said Acharya Mahamandaleshwar Laxmi Narayan, who is a trained Bharatnatyam danseuse also.Welcoming the Kinnar seers, general secretary of Akhil Bharatiya Akhada Parishad, Mahant Hari Giri Maharaj, said that its Sanatan Dharma which involves, imbibes and respects all sections of the society."We had pledged that Kinnar Akhada will take holy Ganga dip along with Juna Akhada seers and finally the time has come. Grand welcome to Kinnar seers in Peshwayi has proven that they are an integral part of our society,” said Mahant Hari Giri, associated with Juna Akhada.Eminent religious scholar Dr Pradeep Joshi said participation of transgenders in this Kumbh has shown the world that they too are religious, have culture, moral values, spiritual awakening, quest for enlightenment and wisdom.Notably, though there are 13 prominent akhadas that come under umbrella of Akhil Bharatiya Akhada Parishad, Kinnar Akhada as a separate sub-entity of Juna Akhada was allowed by Akhada Parishad to carry out royal procession and take holy dip at Sangam-confluence of Ganga-Jamuna-Saraswati in Ardh Kumbh Prayagraj (Allahabad) two years ago.Akhil Bharatiya Akhada Parishad national president Mahant Narendra Giri clarified that initially prior to Prayagraj Kumbh there were objections from some quarter within Akhada Parishad but as Kinnar Akhada had made a written agreement in prior to duly follow traditions and customs of Akhada, their inclusion has been granted by the Akhada Parishad.He added that Kinnar Akhada was not given separate Akhada identity or as 14th Akhada, they have been merged with Shri Panch Dashnam Juna Akhada.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/transgender-seers-participate-in-mahakumbh-at-haridwar-for-first-time-101614861963261.html

04-03-2021||India||Ease of Living Index 2020: Srinagar at bottom of list of 49 cities||Once known for its gardens and clean water bodies, Srinagar has been placed at the bottom of the list in the Ease of Living Index 2020 among 49 cities with a million-plus population.The Ease of Living Index 2020 was released by the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs on Thursday.“The Ease of Living Index (EoLI) is an assessment tool that evaluates the quality of life and the impact of various initiatives for urban development. It provides a comprehensive understanding of participating cities across India based on quality of life, economic-ability of a city, and its sustainability and resilience,” the Union ministry of housing and urban affairs said in a press release.Srinagar’s officers, however, say many projects are underway which could improve the city’s ranking later.Deputy Commissioner Srinagar, Shahid Iqbal Choudhary said that many projects under the smart city project have been taken up which will restore the beauty of the city."The work has already started on various fronts and the projects. Also some parameters on which we worked have not been included in this survey which could have improved our rankings, " he said.While Bangalore has been ranked top among cities with population of more than a million followed by Pune and Ahmedabad Bareilly, Dhanbad and Srinagar are ranked as the bottom three."Unfortunately political unrest and red tapism is one of the reasons for being at the bottom. Besides, policy makers are not among the people who can understand the needs and requirements of local people. So implementation of right policy for the right place keeping the demographics into consideration will help in improving the ease of living standards," said Dr. Umar Nazir Tibet Baqal, a prominent businessman of the city.Former SMC Commissioner, Dr Shafqat Khan said there has been mass lawlessness after the eruption of militancy in the 1990s and large scale violations of the Master Plan in the city."Unplanned urbanisation of Srinagar is a huge setback in land use issues. The other criteria are being taken up now in the Smart city and other central schemes of the Government of India and are now being taken aggressively by the LG Administration."The 15 evaluation criteria included in the ranking are governance, identity and culture, education, health, safety and security, economy, affordable housing, land use planning, public open spaces, transportation and mobility, assured water supply, waste-water management, solid waste management, power, and quality of environment."Unfortunately Srinagar is prone to water logging, flooding seems a permanent phenomenon and there is terrible civil sense among the people. Vehicle parking, shopping and recreational activities are missing here due to which the pressure is mounting on whatever space is available within the city. Hydrological system and solid waste management in the city are inadequate. The breathing space we had in the form of lakes and water bodies, grasslands and green cover is shrinking rapidly. Even the Zabarwan mountains have taken a huge hit and the flood basin of river Jhelum is over and there is hardly anything left to reclaim," said Jaleel Jeelani, an environmental filmmaker.Many people, however, say the survey has revealed the truth about the top city of J&K."The placing of Srinagar at the bottom completely contradicts the projection of Srinagar as a smart city by the officials. Irrespective of the officials’ claims, every common resident here knows that the city lacks even the basic parameters of proper roads, water and electricity. Conflict has often been used as an excuse by the authorities for unplanned development in the city but what is preventing now to plan systematically. We still see officials rushing to spend the money in the last month of the financial year while the same money is kept idle for 11 months," said Gowhar Ahmad who works with an NGO."We still lack proper parking spaces. Electricity and water supply are pathetic. New colonies are being established but why aren't officials using modern techniques to lay electric cables there? In terms of pollution we are still seeing 30-year-old vehicles running on the roads. What worse blunders can there be than open drains still emptying in Jhelum and the Dal,” Ahmad said.Srinagar’s mayor Junaid Mattu could not be contacted for comments on Srinagar ranking at the bottom.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ease-of-living-index-2020-srinagar-at-bottom-of-list-of-49-cities-101614859429981.html
04-03-2021||India||CPI(M) to seek rescheduling of parliament budget session due to assembly polls||The CPI(M) will seek rescheduling of the second phase of the budget session of Parliament beginning from March 8, in view of the assembly elections in five states, party General Secretary Sitaram Yechury said on Thursday. Since majority of the states such as Tamil Nadu, Puducherry, Kerala and Assam have more opposition MPs, they may find it difficult to campaign in these states, where polls are scheduled to held from March 27 to April 6. Noting that the party will seek rescheduling of the session on the first day itself, Yechury said main policies related to the budget or economy can be passed and other topics can be taken up in the next session, so that MPs can campaign in their states. As polls in West Bengal will be conducted in eight phases, the leaders will have enough time for campaigning, he told reporters here. On the election scenario, Yechury alleged that the Narendra Modi-led government has completely destroyed the foundation of Constitution and federal structure and almost all the sectors like industry, education were destroyed by its wrong policies. Accusing the Centre of formulating policies to further 'enrich' the cronies and friends of the PM, the left party leader said even the MSME sector, generating largest employment next to agriculture, was totally neglected. Alleging that the government was targetting voices of dissent by booking them under UAPA and filing sedition cases, he said the Supreme Court has finally ruled that dissenting was not sedition. However, there are many such sedition cases to be disposed of, he added. Yechury slammed the ruling AIADMK for supporting every single measure taken by the BJP led NDA government at the Centre, including the farm bills. "This is not acceptable. That is why CPI(M) is today taking all measures against these parties. We are working to ensure the defeat of BJP-AIADMK alliance in Tamil Nadu. We will cooperate with all the forces to achieve the goal," he said.Replying to a query whether the BJP was behind the decision of late Chief Minister Jayalalithaa's aide V K Sasikala to quit politics, he said, "The BJP has supported and it is quite obvious." Politburo members G Ramakrishnan who was also present said the seat-sharing deal with DMK will be finalised in another two days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cpim-to-seek-rescheduling-of-parliament-budget-session-due-to-assembly-polls-101614858942904.html
04-03-2021||India||Man detained for Taj Mahal hoax bomb call, may have mental health illness: Cop||A man was detained in Uttar Pradesh’s Firozabad on Thursday for allegedly making a hoax call to the police and claiming that a bomb was kept inside the Taj Mahal in Agra, reported news agency PTI. A Satish Ganesh, additional director general (ADG) of police, Agra zone, said the man has been detained for questioning and he seems to be mentally unstable. "Prima facie it seems that he is mentally unstable and is probably under treatment. We are probing why he made such a call. The Taj Mahal was reopened for visitors after about an hour and 45 minutes," he told PTI. The man, who hails from Kasganj, is living at his maternal grandmother's house in a Firozabad village, according to the police.After the threat call to 112 emergency response number of the Uttar Pradesh police at around 9am, nearly 1000 tourists were evacuated from the monument in Agra. Singh had claimed that the bomb placed at the Taj Mahal could go off at any moment.Security personnel soon took over the complex and later declared it safe for visitors after they carried out extensive search and screening operations and could not locate any explosives, officials said. Tourists were told that the Taj Mahal was being closed because of a VVIP visit to prevent panic and after their exit both eastern and western gates of the 17th-century monument were closed, said Ganesh. “Nothing objectionable was found inside the Taj Mahal premises in the search by field unit and thus the call about a bomb threat in Taj Mahal was deemed to be a hoax call,” he said.The monument, which is conserved by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) and protected by the personnel of the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF), was reopened to visitors at 11.15am, officials added.Officials told HT, on the condition of anonymity, that the caller alleged anomalies in the conduct of an ongoing army recruitment camp in Agra, which he claimed had led to his rejection.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/man-detained-for-taj-mahal-hoax-bomb-call-seems-mentally-unstable-police-101614857011822.html

All representatives have welcomed the new guidelines.

This categorisation was brought in the backdrop of these platforms coming under fire for broadcasting content that was seen as obscene and hurting the country’s religious sentiments on multiple occasions.Had a fruitful meeting with representatives from OTT industry and explained the provisions of the OTT rules.

04-03-2021||India||Defiant Kerala govt says KIIFB officials won’t appear for questioning by ED||A defiant Kerala government on Thursday made it clear that officials of the Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board (KIIFB) will not appear for questioning by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in connection with a case registered under the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA).“Nobody can brow beat us like this. Our officials won’t appear before the ED because we met all norms. If it persists, we will organize a mass movement against these agencies that only toe their master’s line,” said finance minister Thomas Isaac, who is the brain behind KIIFB and its funding through masala bondsIsaac also attributed political motive to the ED’s notice ahead of the April 6 assembly election.“The ED top official in Kochi is the son of a senior BJP leader in Rajasthan and he was specially brought to Kerala to trouble the government,” he said.Isaac also said the timing of the ED’s notice was deliberate while the masala bonds were floated two years ago.The Left Front government is particularly riled that the ED notice came just two day after Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitaraman’s public meeting in Ernakulam in which she criticised the constitution of KIIFB and its budgetary provisions. “I don’t know what this organization is. All money is going to it. We also present budgets, but we never give all money to a body and say ‘we will see’. It seems quite weird,” she had said.The ED had sent notices to KIIFB CEO K M Abraham, also a retired additional chief secretary, officials of the Axis Bank (banking partner) and others to appear before it on Friday in connection with a case registered under the FEMA. The central agency said by raising external funds through ‘masala bonds’ KIFFB had violated FEMA provisions.On Wednesday, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan wrote to the Election Commission saying the latest action was a violation of the poll code of conduct. Kerala will vote on April 6 in the assembly election.The CM in his letter to Chief Election Commissioner Sunl Arora said the ED was acting at the behest of the Union finance minister and her statement during recent visit proved it. He sought the intervention of the EC as it was a clear violation of the poll code.KIIFB and masala bondsThe KIIFB is a special purpose vehicle floated in 1999 on the lines of a corporate body for infrastructural development of the state. All development works in major sectors like education, health care, roads and bridges, power and water supply are being carried out through KIIFB. It was floated basically to cut red tape, fix responsibility and ensure better quality in works.After the 2018 floods that ravaged the state, the fund-starved government had decided to tap ‘masala bonds’ which are specialised debt instruments issued outside the country in Indian rupee denomination. In 2019 KIIFB had listed masala bonds worth ₹2150 crore with 9 per cent interest for five-year tenure in London Stock Exchange. KIIFB became the first sub-sovereign entity to tap these bonds and the CM and his officials attended the bell ringing ceremony in the UK with much fanfare. The fund raised through masala bonds was used for several ongoing projects.The Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) was the first to question ‘masala bonds’ saying interest rate was quite high and it could result in loss to the exchequer. It also questioned whether the state government can undertake an external borrowing. Under Article 293 (1), the state can borrow within the territory of India but cannot raise any external loan without the consent of the government, it said. The ED had registered the case on similar ground.But advocates of KIIFB said it was registered as a company under the Companies Act of India and it can raise funds for key infrastructural works. They also cited that permission was obtained from the Reserve Bank of India.“Basically these people have no idea about KIIFB. They have mistaken it for an NBFC (non-banking financial companies). We have taken all necessary permissions,” said Isaac. He said it was weird to think that money sourced by a body corporate should be counted as a borrowing of the state government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/defiant-kerala-govt-says-kiifb-officials-won-t-appear-for-questioning-by-ed-101614854746106.html

The day seeks to increase awareness about all guidelines, which includes road safety, workplace safety, the safety of human health as well as the environment. This year, the focus of National Safety Day is on road safety and the theme is ‘Sadak Suraksha’ (road safety). The celebrations this year have also been spread over a week and National Safety Week will be observed from March 4 to March 10, in order to highlight the importance of safety on the roads.History of National Safety DayThe Union ministry of labour and employment organised a conference on industrial safety for the first time from December 11 to 13, 1965. During the conference, a need was felt for safety councils on national and state levels and a proposal for a National Safety Council was then accepted in the 24th session of the standing labour committee. The campaign for the National Safety Day was born half a decade later, on March 4, 1972, to mark the National Safety Council’s day of formation.The National Safety Council is a non-profit, self-financing and tripartite apex body set up to generate, develop and sustain a voluntary movement on safety, health and environment at the national level.Road safety in IndiaData from the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) shows that 421,104 accidental human deaths occurred in the year 2019 out of which traffic accidents alone were 467,171 in number.Last month, while inaugurating the Road Safety Month, Union road, transport and highways minister Nitin Gadkari said that the government is working on its promise to ensure road safety and reduce accidental deaths as well. "We had promised to reduce road fatalities by 50 per cent. Tamil Nadu has done it, with a success rate of 53 per cent. If we wait till 2030, 6-7 lakh more people will die. So, we've made a commitment that before 2025, road accidents and deaths due to it will be brought down by 50 per cent with help of people's participation," Gadkari said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/national-safety-day-2021-sadak-suraksha-theme-to-be-observed-this-year-101614852959414.html

The series premiered on Amazon Prime on January 15 and Purohit has been named in multiple FIRs over controversies around it.Also Read: Some OTT platforms showing pornographic content, observes SCAppearing for Purohit, senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi said that the cases against her are "shocking". He further said that Purohit is just an employee of Amazon; she is neither a producer nor an actor. Rohatgi said that Purohit has been made accused in around 10 cases related to 'Tandav'.The lawyer contended that OTT regulations have come and the Allahabad high court order was not based on these regulations. "It's about freedom of speech and expression," he added. Rohatgi also said that 'Tandav' is not available for free, it can be only watched by payment. He called those who has filed the FIRs as "publicity seekers".The Supreme Court bench of justices Ashok Bhushan and RS Reddy then asked the Centre to present before it the regulations put in place by the government on Over The Top (OTT) platforms and adjourned the hearing till Friday.Purohit was denied pre-arrest bail by the high court on February 25 in the ongoing investigation against 'Tandav' in connection with hurting religious sentiments and objectionable content. Dismissing her petition, the high court highlighted the offensive language used in the web series and said Purohit has scant respect for law and order.The Uttar Pradesh Police filed an FIR against the top Amazon Prime Video executive, and the actors and makers of the web series for the derogatory depiction of Hindu deities and promoting religious enmity."Such people make the revered figures of the religion of majority community the source of earning money in a most brazen manner taking benefit of the liberal and tolerant tradition of the country," the high court said.On January 27, the Supreme Court refused to grant interim protection from arrest to actors and makers of 'Tandav' and asked them to approach high courts for relief from arrest or quashing of FIRs.'Tandav', a nine-episode web series, premiered on Amazo Prime Video on January 15.

We are either donating it to foreign countries or selling it to foreign countries and are not vaccinating our own people. So there has to be that sense of responsibility and urgency," the bench said.It also asked the Delhi government to carry out inspection of medical facilities available in court complexes here and to report if COVID-19 vaccination centres could be set up there.The high court was hearing a PIL initiated by it to examine the demand of Bar Council of Delhi to declare all people associated with the judicial functioning, including judges, court staff and lawyers as “frontline workers” so that they could receive COVID-19 vaccination on priority and without limitations of their age or physical condition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-hc-seeks-details-on-capacity-to-manufacture-covid-19-vaccines-101614848436514.html
04-03-2021||India||India proposes inclusion of Chabahar port in international north-south corridor||India on Thursday proposed the inclusion of Iran’s Chabahar port in the International North South Transport Corridor (INSTC), a 7,200km multi-mode route spanning 13 countries, and also called for Uzbekistan and Afghanistan to be made part of the corridor. Chabahar port, where an Indian state-run firm operates a terminal, is a key part of India’s plans to enhance connectivity to Afghanistan and the Central Asian states. The port played an important role in shipping humanitarian aid to Afghanistan amid the Covid-19 pandemic and India recently supplied heavy cranes to boost its capabilities. Addressing the virtual “Chabahar Day” event organised on the margins of the Maritime India Summit 2021, external affairs minister S Jaishankar and minister of state for shipping Mansukh Mandaviya spoke about plans to include the Iranian port in INSTC. Also Read | EAM Jaishankar to travel to Bangladesh tomorrow to prepare for PM Modi’s visitJaishankar welcomed the interest shown by Uzbekistan and Afghanistan in joining the multilateral corridor and said: “Establishing an eastern corridor through Afghanistan would maximise its potential.” He added, “I am hopeful that during the INSTC coordination council meeting, member states would agree to the expansion of the INSTC route to include the Chabahar port and also agree on expanding the membership of this project.” Mandaviya proposed the meeting of the INSTC coordination council meeting, which was to be held last year but was put off because of the pandemic, should be held virtually to take things forward. “Chabahar port is part of our shared commitment to the peace, stability and prosperity of the people of Afghanistan,” Mandaviya said, adding the port had helped Afghanistan diversity its export opportunities. The INSTC project, which includes India, Iran, Russia, Turkey, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz republic, Tajikistan, Oman, Syria and Ukraine, was first proposed in 2000 to cut costs and time in moving cargo and to improve connectivity in the region between Russia and the Central Asian states and India. Though there were dry runs on some routes in 2014, the project has been slow to take off. Despite renewed focus on INSTC by India and Russia, work was again hit by the pandemic. Jaishankar highlighted Chabahar’s role in recent years in sending Indian humanitarian aid and emergency supplies to Afghanistan and Iran and in opening up trade opportunities. The Chabahar Day event reflects India’s commitment to work with regional stakeholders to enhance connectivity and provide unhindered access to the sea to the landlocked Central Asian states, he said. “The Chabahar port has not only emerged as a commercial transit hub for the region but also facilitated the delivery of humanitarian assistance, especially during the Covid-19 pandemic...India utilised the Chabahar port to ship 75,000 tonnes of wheat as humanitarian food assistance to Afghanistan in September 2020,” he said. India helped Iran to fight the worst locust invasion of the past 25 years by supplying 25 tonnes of the drug Malathion in June 2020 through Chabahar. The second batch of 25 tonnes of Malathion recently reached Chabahar, he added. Afghanistan, Iran and India signed a tripartite agreement on developing Chabahar port and setting up a trilateral transport and transit corridor in 2016. India then set up India Ports Global Limited to operate the Shahid Behesti terminal at Chabahar. Since the Indian firm began operations in December 2018, the port has handled 123 vessels, 13,752 containers and 1.8 million tonnes of cargo, Mandaviya said. There has also been an increase in the average monthly calls by merchant vessels, and 110,000 tonnes of wheat and 2,000 tonnes of pulses have been shipped to Afghanistan. Iran’s transport minister Mohammad Eslami called for more lines of credit from India to build and equip Chabahar port and to complete infrastructure for transport networks in the region. There are plans to expand the Shahid Behesti terminal’s capacity from 8.5 million tonnes to 13 million tonnes, he said. Ministers from Afghanistan, Armenia, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan and Russia participated in the Chabahar Day event.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-proposes-inclusion-of-chabahar-port-in-international-north-south-corridor-101614848496070.html

04-03-2021||India||Supreme Court rejects plea requesting extension of GST amnesty scheme||The Supreme Court on Thursday declined to issue directives on extending the Goods and Services Tax (GST) amnesty scheme, saying it was “a policy decision exclusively within the domain of the government”.A Supreme Court bench comprising justices Dhananjaya Y Chadrachud and MR Shah dismissed a petition by a trader from Chhattisgarh’s Bilaspur who had urged the court to direct the Central government and the GST council to extend the amnesty scheme, giving more time to small businesses and MSMEs to file their returns.The petition by Satyakam Arya had assailed the notification issued by the GST council on June 24, 2020 which had given time till September 30, 2020 for filing of returns between July 2017 and July 2020, capping the late fee at ₹500. For any subsequent delay, a late fee of ₹50 per day had been prescribed as penalty. It asked for an extension of the scheme by two months, besides reimbursement of the late fee already collected.Also Read | SC to hear women officers’ petitions for permanent commission in Army, NavyBut the bench said in its order:“In our view, these reliefs, as sought in the petition, pertain in the realm of policy decisions. It would be inappropriate for this court to entertain a petition of this nature, such as extension of the amnesty scheme; a cap on the late fee to be collected; exemption of late fee paid for a period between March 25, 2020 and June 30, 2020 and refund of the amount already collected towards late fee.”The court emphasised that the amnesty scheme was itself a “policy intervention” by the government of India and that “the terms on which the amnesty scheme was executed in the realm of a policy decision.”The petition, filed through advocate Aviral Saxena, had argued that small traders had not been able to avail of these schemes because they neither had the infrastructure like big business houses nor had they the liberty to step out and do the needful because of the lockdown last year due to the Covid-19 pandemic.The bench, however, remained disinclined to examine the matter. “The question is entirely of policy. How can a court interfere with this under Article 32 (writ jurisdiction)? These are even otherwise concessions granted as per a policy decision. These are not matters of rights. We cannot issue a mandamus to the government in an amnesty scheme,” it told the lawyer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-rejects-plea-requesting-extension-of-gst-amnesty-scheme-101614846335700.html

04-03-2021||India||Plea in Supreme Court seeks appointment of regular CBI director||The government’s decision to appoint an interim director for the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) bypassing the selection procedure provided in the Delhi Special Police Establishment Act has been challenged in the Supreme Court.NGO Common Cause filed a petition on Thursday seeking urgent directions from the court to the Centre to initiate and complete the process of the selection of CBI director and to ensure that the process is initiated at least one or two months before the post is to become vacant. The petition is yet to be listed before the court.Also Read | SC to hear women officers’ petitions for permanent commission in Army, NavyThe NGO has approached the court through advocate Prashant Bhushan, challenging the decision taken by the Centre on February 3, 2021 to appoint Pravin Sinhas as an interim or acting director till the appointment of a new director or until further orders. This order was required as the two-year term of CBI director Rishi Kumar Shukla came to an end on February 2. He was appointed by an order issued by the Department of Personnel and Training on February 2, 2019 for a two-year tenure, after the approval of the Appointments Committee of the Cabinet.The petition said, “The director of the CBI is the final authority in the organisation. He supervises all the work in the CBI and is responsible for constitution of investigating teams for probing cases. Hence, this court and later even Parliament have made determined efforts to enhance the functional autonomy of the CBI director and limit the extent of executive discretion in the matter of appointment of this key functionary.”Bhushan, who drafted the petition, said that Section 4A of the DSPE Act provides for a high-powered committee headed by Prime Minister and comprising the leader of single largest Opposition Party and the Chief Justice of India (or any judge of the Supreme Court nominated by CJI) to recommend the name of the CBI director. This process was not followed by the Centre as the work on appointment of the new director ought to have begun two months before the previous director retired last month.The same NGO had approached the Supreme Court in the year 2016 for the appointment of a regular director of CBI after the government had attempted to appoint an interim director. “Now the same issue has cropped up again, which has to be dealt with utmost seriousness in view of the sheer power that vests with the important office of a CBI director,” the petition stated.Since the CBI is probing cases involving rampant corruption in high places in the country, the unwillingness of the government to institute a transparent and accountable system to ensure that the culprits are punished seriously impairs the right of the people to live in a corruption and crime free society which violates Articles 14 (right to equality) and 21 (right to life and liberty) of the citizens, added the petition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/plea-in-supreme-court-seeks-appointment-of-regular-cbi-director-101614845376023.html

An official of Madhya Pradesh's social justice department on Wednesday said the birthmark information provided by a woman from Marathwada in Maharashtra has matched with that of Geeta. However, the DNA test to ascertain the parentage is yet to be done.If the DNA test comes positive, Geeta, 29, would be known as Radha Waghmare, a resident of Jintur village of Parbhani district in Maharashtra, said Suchita Tirkey, joint director of MP’s social justice department.Geeta currently lives in an Anand Foundation’s home in Indore and its convenor, Gyanendra Purohit, said, “Now a resident of Naigaon, Meena Dinkar Pandhare, 71, is 100% sure that Geeta is her daughter from her first marriage.”“Everything Geeta shared from her childhood memories --- sugarcane fields, maternity home in front of a railway station, diesel engine and food habits --- matched with that of Pandhare's village," he said.He added that they believed Meena’s claim when she said Geeta must have a burn mark on her stomach. “Geeta was not keen to confirm the birthmark but when a woman police constable checked, she found the exact mark on her stomach,” he added.Purohit said they started searching for her parents in July last year with the help of her facial features, food habits and childhood memories.They got the clue that Geeta could possibly be from Maharashtra, when in October 2020, they rescued a girl from an ashram from MP’s Dewas district.“The girl also had a right nose piercing like Geeta. We asked for her whereabouts and the girl said she was from Marathwada. We got in touch with Pahal Foundation of Parbhani in Marathwada, which also works for speech and hearing-impaired people, and sought their help to find Geeta’s parents,” said Purohit.“In December, Meena, who is illiterate and knows only Marathi, contacted us, saying her daughter went missing in 1999-2000. Geeta also confirmed everything Meena said but when she came to know about her economic condition, she was reluctant to move with her. However, Mina visits the shelter frequently with food,” he added.Also Read:US welcomes steps taken to return J-K to full economic, political normalcyPahal foundation convener Aniket Salgaoncar, who is also hearing and speech impaired, said through sign language, “We are happy that Geeta found her mother. But she doesn’t want to move with her mother, and it is obvious because she has met her after 20 years. She wanted to do a job so we are providing skill training to her.”Geeta went missing 20 years ago and reached Pakistan in 2000. According to documents provided by Edhi foundation of Pakistan, who looked after her for 13 years, she was found sitting alone in Samjhauta express in Lahore in 2000.Former foreign affairs minister (late) Sushma Swaraj played an important role in her repatriation in 2015. More than 24 couples have claimed to be her parents in the past but failed to establish their parenthood due to DNA mismatch.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/new-hope-to-unite-geeta-with-family-5-years-after-repatriation-from-pakistan-101614843111606.html

"We have been seeing this as happening often. Those who put forth facts are being pressurised in this way so that they don't speak up," he said.Union minister Prakash Javadekar, however, dismissed links between the I-T raids and the recent comments of Anurag and Taapsee and said this speculation is "too much". "Probe agencies undertake investigations based on credible information and the matter later goes to courts as well," he added.IT officials on Wednesday said all businesses, financial transactions, talent and event management contracts between Phantom and other entities are under scrutiny. The searches will now continue as I-T officials will look into the bank accounts and lockers of these personalities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ungliyon-pe-nachana-rahul-gandhi-slams-i-t-raids-on-anurag-kashyap-taapsee-101614841063232.html
04-03-2021||India||Ease of Living Index 2020: Bengaluru, Shimla adjudged best cities||Among Indian cities with a population of over a million, the ease of living is the highest in Bengaluru, Pune and Ahmedabad while it is the lowest in Bareilly, Dhanbad and Srinagar, according to the Ease of Living Index 2020 prepared by the ministry of housing and urban affairs. In cities with population less than a million, Shimla was ranked the highest while Muzaffarpur in Bihar was had the lowest score. With Prime Minister Narendra Modi emphasising the ease of living, along with the ease of doing business, as a key policy priority, the rankings of cities have assumed significance in shaping government policies and determining expenditure priorities. A total of 111 cities participated in the assessment exercise that was conducted in 2020. The first edition of the index was launched in 2018. It was based on indicators across 15 evaluation criteria, including governance, identity and culture, education, health, safety and security, economy, affordable housing, land use planning, public open spaces, transportation and mobility, assured water supply, waste-water management, solid waste management, power, and quality of environment. Also Read | Once a source of drinking water, Bengaluru river now filled with froth, stenchThe 2020 report, reviewed by HT, noted that the index was born out of the need to measure the outcomes of programmes and “verify whether these interventions were effective in ushering progress in urban India”. The index is also based on metrics that “align with sustainable development goals”. Union housing minister Hardeep Puri said, “India’s steady economic growth is reflected in the rapid expansion of her cities. India, today is one of the fastest-growing large economies in the world. With the current urbanisation rate, India is expected to have 50 percent of the country’s population residing in cities within the next 30 years.” Puri acknowledged that while rising urbanisation promises innovation and growth, it also puts “tremendous pressure on available resources”. The ministry also drafted a report on the “Municipal Performance Index 2020” in a bid to determine elements that prevent efficient local governance in service delivery mechanisms, planning, financial systems, and governance practice. In the million-plus category, Indore has emerged as the highest ranked municipality, followed by Surat and Bhopal while Guwahati, Kota and Srinagar ranked lowest. Among municipalities catering to a population of a less than a million, New Delhi Municipal Council has emerged as the leader, followed by Tirupati and Gandhinagar while Shillong, Imphal and Kohima municipalities were ranked lowest. The MPI examined the sectoral performance of 114 municipalities (with Delhi being assessed separately for NDMC, and the three Municipal Corporations) across five verticals which comprise of 20 sectors and 100 indicators in all totality. The five verticals under MPI include services, finance, policy, technology and governance, the report noted. The methodology and approach for the revised edition of EoLI and MPI were released by the ministry in February 2019. Essentially, the EoLI report aims to measure the well-being of Indian citizens in 111 cities, across the pillars of Quality of Life, Economic-ability, and Sustainability, with 49 indicators under 14 categories, the report noted. It also incorporates citizen perception of cities into the index through the Citizen Perception Survey that was conducted by the housing ministry. “The EoLI primarily seeks to accelerate India’s urban development outcomes, including the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals. The findings from the index can help guide evidence-based policymaking. It also promotes healthy competition among cities, encouraging them to learn from their peers and advance their development trajectory,” it added. The Citizen Perception Survey (CPS) was undertaken from January 16 March 20, 2020. A total of 3.22 million citizens from 111 cities participated in the survey.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ease-of-living-index-2020-bengaluru-shimla-adjudged-best-cities-101614842495627.html

04-03-2021||India||Mizoram prepares for possible influx of refugees fleeing Myanmar after coup||District authorities of Champhai in Mizoram bordering Myanmar are gearing up for a possible influx of refugees fleeing the neighbouring country after last month’s military coup there. The state shares a 510km-long border with Myanmar and there’s a possibility that those who fear political persecution could flee and enter India seeking refuge. In an order issued on Tuesday, the Champhai administration asked people in the district, especially those residing in border areas, to immediately notify them of any information about Myanmarese nationals entering India seeking shelter. “If somebody crosses over without the notice of the district administration or village councils in border areas, they have to be caught and the local authorities alerted. They have to record entries of people who are not Indian nationals,” Maria CT Zuali, deputy commissioner, Champhai, said over phone. Also Read | Mizoram CM presents budget for FY22 with outlay of ₹11 croreOnce village councils submit reports of any such entry of Myanmar nationals in their areas, the district administration will take action on them in consultation with the Centre. “We will try and find out if at all the lives of those entering India are threatened in Myanmar. We can decide on these people based on what the Centre says. They will be deported if we are not granted permission to take them in as refugees,” Zuali said. The DC stated that as of now, no Myanmarese nationals have entered the district following the military coup. But there have been some reports of people seeking refugee status. “We have heard some such reports from a few village councils. We will have a meeting on Thursday on how to treat these illegal migrants. We have to scrutinise each such person and the reason for their trying to enter India. We don’t want any militants trying to sneak in,” she said. The order stated that those who face danger of persecution by the present leadership in Myanmar due to their political beliefs should be regarded as refugees and given shelter in the district. It added that a large number of people might flee Myanmar and seek refuge in India as a result of the coup and the growing civil disobedience against it. Along with the order, the district authority also issued a proforma for the “identification of migrants/refugees entering Mizoram from Myanmar in connection with military coup”. Besides recording the personal details of each Myanmarese national, it would also enumerate information on whether that individual belongs to any political organisation targeted by the military in the neighbouring country, reasons for fleeing and if they face any “real and imminent threat”. The order by the Champhai administration is in line with standard operating procedures (SOPs) prepared earlier by the state’s home department regarding refugees from Myanmar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mizoram-prepares-for-possible-influx-of-refugees-fleeing-myanmar-after-coup-101614839075690.html

To qualify as a vaccination centre, private hospitals must have an adequate number of vaccinators, adequate space for observation of the vaccinated, adequate cold chain arrangement and adequate arrangement for the management of any adverse effect following the immunisation.Roping in private hospitals was a major step for the government in this phase of the vaccination. Initially, private hospitals only empanelled under Central Government Health Scheme, Ayushman Bharat-Pradhan Mantri Jan Aarogya Yojana and similar State Health Insurance schemes were allowed to function as vaccination centres. But now the Centre has said that all private hospitals can take part in vaccination.On March 1, the second phase of vaccination started with 27,000 hospitals; 12,500 are private hospitals; 11,000 are Ayushman Bharat empanelled hospitals, 800 – CGHS.

A bench comprising the Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde, justices L Nageswara Rao and S Ravindra Bhat passed the order on Wednesday on a petition filed by one Tahmina Khatun and 25 others. Advocate Jayshree Satpute, who appeared for the petitioners, informed the court that the women had approached the authorities in 2019 and filed a plea under the Right to Information Act to know why they were classified as D-voters or doubtful voters. The Electoral Registration Officer (ERO) in September 2019 responded by saying that the women were put in the D-voter category in 1997. However, the ERO said that there were no records stating why. Also Read | BJP holds crucial meeting with allies over seat-sharing in AssamOf the 26 petitioners, 24 belong to Bheragaon in Barpeta district, where Muslims are in the majority. After being classified as D-voters, the petitioners alleged that they and their families have faced social stigma. It is not known whether their family members’ names are also in the doubtful voter list. The bench observed that the point raised in the petition required consideration and asked the EC and Centre to respond within four weeks. The petition prayed for a direction to remove their names from the doubtful voter list as this would bring their citizenship under a cloud. Placing an individual in this list denies a person basic rights and legal rights, which includes right to ration and right to vote, apart from constitutional guarantees. The petitioners claimed that they were neither heard nor allowed an opportunity to explain by the authorities before being placed in the doubtful voter category. The development is also significant since the election process for assembly polls in Assam has already begun.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-seeks-centre-ec-response-on-listing-26-assam-women-in-doubtful-voters-list-101614837635342.html

04-03-2021||India||Stability of rocks, river flow in Rishi Ganga needs careful monitoring: Analysis||An analysis of the February 7 Uttarakhand glacier breach has cautioned that the stability of remaining rocks or ice masses and slopes around the rock that detached needs to be monitored carefully to prevent more disasters. The ice and rock mass detached at an elevation of 5,600 m from a north-facing slope northeast of Trisul peak in Nanda Devi mountain.The analysis by Glacier and Permafrost Hazards in Mountains (GAPHAZ), a scientific standing group of the International Association of Cryospheric Sciences and the International Permafrost Association, underlined large volumes of debris have been eroded and deposited along the river channel after the breach. In combination with water from rivers, snowmelt, heavy monsoon rain, or overflow of temporary lakes, debris flows can be triggered from these depositions and pose danger downstream.Also Read | Scientists warn of rebound after record 7% fall in global emissionsThe analysis said it is difficult to assess the state of the temporary lake at the confluence above Raini village from remote sensing data alone. Dam conditions need to be critically analysed and erosion by the flood has probably undercut some slopes. “Some high-resolution satellite images indicate tension cracks on and above slopes with signs for movements, but it is difficult to evaluate the evolution of these cracks and attribute them to the February 7 avalanche. Detailed evaluation and monitoring of the slopes along the entire stretch of the river are recommended. Such slope instabilities could affect roads, villages, and other infrastructure located far above the riverbed,” the analysis said.GAPHAZ cited early findings by geologists that a major rock/ice avalanche caused the massive floods in the Rishiganga river and left scores dead and missing. Analysis of satellite imagery from the area shows that the event occurred due to failure deep within the bedrock of the mountain, and the glacier ice was most probably entrained with the collapsing block of bedrock.The depth of the failure plane is more than 100 m below the surface, where no seasonal temperature variations are expected. The zone is in permafrost conditions where ground temperatures are below zero. Some have speculated that heat fluxes from the warmer south face of the mountain to the colder north face, where the avalanche detached, could have warmed the frozen bedrock, leading to the avalanche.According to estimates by GAPHAZ, the avalanche volume was 20 million m3 of rock (83%) and calcium; 4 million m3 of ice (17%). This puts the event into a category of the largest contemporary mass movements in mountains on a global scale, says the analysis.The very steep avalanche trajectory, dropping around 2000 m in elevation over a distance of about 3.3 km, indicates the release of high impact energy. Along with the entrainment, most of the ice of the avalanche may have melted. In addition, the area under snow may have also melted due to the frictional energy of the avalanche leading to run-off.Liquid water from snow and ice melting could have infiltrated the bedrock in cleft systems and destabilised the rock through freeze-thaw processes, the analysis has suggested.Satellite imagery also indicates that a similar event occurred in the neighbouring glacier in September 2016.Anil Kulkarni, distinguished scientist, Divecha Center for Climate Change at Indian Institute of Science, said it is true that there was a major ice or rock avalanche, and part of a hanging glacier came down with it. “We have calculated the ice volumes which is in millions of cubic metres. The slope was around 30 degrees. But what is not known is what triggered the melting of this ice. There is some speculation that it was in a soft, deglaciated valley which led to melting but that is crucial information which is still missing.”Carolina Adler, executive director, Mountain Research Institute, University of Bern, said in the longer term, it is inevitable that in such high, remote, steep, sensitive, rapidly warming, and deglaciating environments, large infrastructure projects can be exposed to considerable natural risks. “However, a paucity of long-term, informative data, the likelihood of climate change-induced non-stationarity, and the complex, cascading nature of such events make these risks extremely challenging to quantify reliably,” Adler said in a statement. “It may therefore be appropriate for the viability of such infrastructure projects to be reappraised. At the very least, in order to protect people and infrastructure who are inherently in harm’s way (e.g. hydro-electric power stations), ongoing multi-variate monitoring of upstream environments, coupled with early warning systems that exploit modern technology and associated mandatory drills, would seem imperative.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/stability-of-rocks-river-flow-in-rishi-ganga-needs-careful-monitoring-analysis-101614834995703.html

Here is all you need to know about the matter:• The court maintained that “dissent” is a form of free speech and expression.• It added these rights are protected under the Constitution.• The comments came at a time when governments and law enforcement agencies around the country have been quick to slap sedition charges against critics.• “Expression of views which are different from the opinion of the government cannot be termed as seditious. It cannot become sedition only because one has a different view,” said the bench comprising Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul and Justice Hemant Gupta.Also Read | Delhi riots: Court takes cognisance of sedition charges against 18• India’s sedition law was introduced by the British in 1870. • The word “sedition” did not appear in the Constitution when it was adopted on November 26, 1949, and Article 19(1)(a) gave absolute freedom of speech and expression. • However, section 124A stayed in the Indian Penal Code. In 1951, Jawaharlal Nehru brought in the first amendment of the Constitution to limit the freedom under Article 19(1)(a) and enacted Article 19(2) to empower the State to put curbs in the form of “reasonable restrictions” on right to free speech.• In 1962, in Kedar Nath Singh Vs State of Bihar, a constitution bench of the top court upheld the validity of the sedition law under the IPC and also defined the scope of sedition. • It held that Section 124A only penalised words that reveal an intent or tendency to disturb law and order or that seem to incite violence. • This definition has been taken as a precedent for all matters pertaining to Section 124A since.• “Just because you dissent from the views of the government, will it become sedition?” the bench asked the lawyer for the petitioners, Rajat Sharma and Neh Srivastava. • Vadodara-based Sharma is secretary and trustee of organisation “Vishwa Guru India Vision of Sardar Patel” while Srivastava is a social activist from Uttar Pradesh’s Ghaziabad.• The court also imposed a fine of ₹50,000 on the petitioners for filing what it termed a “frivolous” petition.• “What kind of a petition is this? People must be penalised for filing such petitions,” said the bench after the petitioners’ counsel failed to substantiate the claim that Abdullah called for support from China and Pakistan against the negation of Article 370, which did away with the special status granted to J&K and its citizens.• The petition cited a statement by BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra as a chief ground. It relied upon some media reports to quote Patra as claiming that Abdullah had delivered a speech seeking China’s help in restoring Article 370.• But this averment could not be corroborated by the petitioners’ lawyer Shiv Sagar Tiwary even as the bench asked repeatedly as to when and where Abdullah issued the alleged statement.• On February 23, a Delhi court, while granting bail to climate activist Disha Ravi, raised serious questions about the Delhi Police’s invocation of the sedition charge.• According to the data from the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), cases of sedition and under the stringent UAPA for terror cases showed a rise in 2019, but only 3% of the sedition cases resulted in a conviction.• The year 2019 saw a 25% increase in the number of sedition cases and a 41% increase in arrests over the previous year. A total of 93 cases of sedition were reported in 2019, with 96 arrests and charge sheets filed in 76 cases, as against 70 cases, 56 arrests, and 27 charge sheets the previous year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-rejects-sedition-plea-against-farooq-abdullah-all-you-need-to-know-101614834515411.html

Here is all you need to know about it and what it means:• The announcement based on preliminary results from Covaxin’s Phase 3 clinical trials is expected to come as a shot in the arm for India’s vaccination drive.• The vaccine was approved for an emergency roll-out on January 16 before it was established to be effective in preventing Covid-19.• Experts, as well as authorities, pointed to Phase 1 and 2 trials that showed that Covaxin was safe and produced an adequate immune response.• Phase 1, 2, and 3 trials involved around 27,000 participants. Also Read | ‘People criticised us’: Bharat Biotech head on Covaxin’s journey from March 2020• Covaxin demonstrates a high clinical efficacy trend against Covid-19 but also significant immunogenicity against the rapidly emerging variants, said Krishna Ella, chairman, and managing director, Bharat Biotech.• The detailed data is yet to be released or peer-reviewed. • The results are based on an interim analysis when 43 infections took place among the 25,800 people who were part of the trials.• Of these, 36 were among those given a placebo, while seven got the vaccine, translating to an efficacy rate of 80.6%, the company said.• The indigenous vaccine has met with severe hesitancy, particularly among health care workers, for want of the efficacy data.• Disaggregated data from Delhi, for example, showed in January that turnout at locations administering Covaxin was as low as 25%, while it was 75% for those using Covishield, the domestically produced version of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine.• As of Wednesday, 16.3 million doses of the two vaccines have been administered to people across the country.• Covaxin uses an inactivated virus paired with an adjuvant – a chemical that boosts immune response. • Covaxin is based on a tried-and-tested platform, the other vaccine India is giving to its people – Covishield – makes use of a newer Trojan horse-like technique known as the adenovirus platform. • An efficacy higher than 50% is considered acceptable, according to World Health Organization (WHO) norms.• Two other vaccines that are being used widely around the world use a breakthrough technology known as the mRNA platform and report an efficacy rate above 95%. But both of these require freezing temperatures to be stored or transported.• Covaxin is stable at 2°C to 8°C, temperatures that can be typically achieved by refrigerators, and is shipped in a ready-to-use liquid formulation that permits distribution using existing vaccine supply chain channels.• The Phase 3 study enrolled 25,800 participants between 18 and 98 years of age, including 2,433 over the age of 60 and 4,500 with comorbidities. • The primary endpoint of Phase 3 clinical trial is based on the first occurrence of PCR-confirmed symptomatic (mild, moderate, or severe) Covid-19 with onset at least 14 days after the second dose is given.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covaxin-has-81-efficacy-says-bharat-biotech-what-does-it-mean-101614833555283.html
04-03-2021||India||SC allows man to meet daughter who has accused him of killing her mother||The Supreme Court has allowed a man to meet his daughter, who has accused him of killing her mother, saying it would be “in the best interest” of the six-year-old to maintain her relationship with him, especially since the charges were yet to be proved.A bench, headed by Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul, called the situation “difficult” as the child had recorded her statement as an eyewitness to her mother’s murder at their home in Haryana’s Bhiwani in January 2020. It added she later gave a different version to a judge in the Rajasthan high court where her maternal grandfather had gone for her custody. She told the high court that her father might not be responsible for her mother’s death.The bench also noted that even though the child had also accused her paternal grandparents of helping her father strangulate her mother, the trial court could not find any evidence against the grandparents and they were thus exonerated last year.The father has been charged with dowry death under Section 304B of the Indian Penal Code because of the girl’s testimony. He was currently out on bail, said the court in its order last month.Also Read | SC to hear women officers’ petitions for permanent commission in Army, Navy“This thus throws some question marks on how much the child can be believed in the given situation. There are findings by the magistrate and in the impugned order which seek to suggest that both the sides, i.e., the maternal and the paternal side may be tutoring the child in their respective perspectives,” held the bench, which also included justices Dinesh Maheshwari and Hrishikesh Roy.“However, we are concerned with protecting the interest of the child who has already suffered a trauma of the loss of the mother...it is appropriate for the proper upbringing of the child that interaction with the father be maintained in this period of time as the trial is yet to take place.”The bench then said that it would be appropriate if the interaction between the child and the father and her paternal grandparents could take place. It added the custody of the child should continue with her maternal grandfather and the maternal aunt in Rajasthan.“We thus remit the matter back to the Rajasthan high court on the limited issue of making appropriate arrangements for the visiting rights of the father and the paternal grandparents of the child while maintaining the impugned order of giving custody to the maternal side as it is.”The bench was hearing a petition by the father and his parents, who wanted custody of the child. The court concluded that it would not be prudent to disturb the custody but accepted that the girl must have an association with her father and the paternal grandparents.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-allows-man-to-meet-daughter-who-has-accused-him-of-killing-her-mother-101614832235276.html
04-03-2021||India||'People criticised us': Bharat Biotech head on Covaxin's journey from March 2020||As Bharat Biotech published the interim efficacy report of the phase 3 clinical trial on indigenous Covaxin, which was found to have 81 per cent efficacy, chairman and managing director Krishna Ella addressed the criticism that the vaccine faced since the trial report was awaited.In a video message issued by the company, he said, "Remembering people criticising us saying our data is not transparent, not in the public domain, I am today proud to say that our data are in the public domain in six publications. If people have got patience, they should read those articles."In March 2020, the National Institute of Virology successfully isolated the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) entered into a partnership with Bharat Biotech to develop the virus isolate into an effective vaccine candidate.Bharat Biotech got the strain in May and since then work has been going on. The phase 1 and phase 2 clinical trials conducted in 755 participants demonstrated a high safety profile of the candidate vaccine with seroconversion rates of 98.3 per cent and 81.1 per cent on day 56 and 104, respectively.The phase 3 trial was started in the middle of November and was conducted on a total of 25,800 individuals across 21 sites. However, the interim result was based on 43 cases, of which 36 cases were observed in the placebo group and the other seven were observed in the Covaxin group, resulting in a point estimate of vaccine efficacy of 80.6 per cent.The vaccine got restricted emergency use approval in January in absence of the phase 3 data. Several ministers, doctors raised questions over administering Covaxin to healthcare workers and frontline workers. Questions were also raised on how in the second phase of vaccination people can be charged for a shot that is still under trial.Soon after the nod from the Drug Controller General of India, Bharat Biotech and Serum Institute of India issued a joint statement clearing the air that there is no competition over vaccines between the two vaccine-makers.Out of over 1 crore vaccines administered till last week, only 11 per cent was Covaxin. However, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Union health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan took Covaxin shots to dispel misconceptions about the vaccine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/people-criticised-us-bharat-biotech-head-on-covaxin-s-journey-from-march-2020-101614831057473.html
04-03-2021||India||Six states contribute 86% of daily new Covid cases: Govt data||Six states in India currently contribute nearly 86% of the new cases of Coronavirus disease (Covid-19), government data shows. Maharashtra, Kerala, Punjab, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat and Karnataka also continue to report a surge in the daily new cases.On Wednesday, 14,989 new cases were registered from across the country, of which Maharashtra has reported the highest daily new cases at 7,863. It is followed by Kerala with 2,938 cases, while Punjab reported 729 new cases.According to the Union ministry of health and family welfare, Maharashtra, Punjab, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Delhi, Haryana and Karnataka have shown the maximum increase in new cases on a week-on-week basis. “Maharashtra alone accounted for a weekly increase of 16,012 cases, in terms of the number of cases. In percentage terms, Punjab reported the weekly increase of 71.5% (1,783 cases),” said health ministry in a statement.Central teams that have been rushed to these states, to assist local authorities in managing the situation, are trying to get to the cause, and initial observation says large gatherings and drop in overall testing could have led to the surge.“It is a season of weddings, and people tend to gather in large numbers on such occasions and also there is somewhat laxity in observing Covid-19 appropriate behaviour. Another reason could be drop in overall testing as some of the states where there has been seen a surge, Covid-19 testing relatively went down. The teams have been directed to brief the state authorities in detail about the reasons so that the situation can be managed accordingly,” said a senior government official in the know of things, who did not wish to be identified.The three-member teams are headed by joint secretary level officers in the health ministry. The teams have been rushed to Maharashtra, Kerala, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Punjab, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, and Jammu and Kashmir.Apart from the teams on ground, the central government is constantly in touch with the state governments where high case load of active cases and the surge in new cases has been reported.“States/UTs have been advised to maintain a continued rigorous vigil for containing the spread of Covid-19 such the gains of collective efforts are not squandered away. Need for effective testing, comprehensive tracking, prompt isolation of positive cases and quick quarantine of close contacts are strongly emphasised,” said health ministry in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/six-states-contribute-86-of-daily-new-covid-cases-govt-data-101614830195364.html

The lead petitioner CV Gayathri and others stated that after the enactment of the Constitution 102nd Act, 2018, the Tamil Nadu law had to be tested based on this law. “Issues which have been raised in these writ petitions have bearing on the questions which have been referred to the larger Bench, hence, it is appropriate that these petitions be heard along with the challenge to the Maratha quota law,” said senior advocate Maninder Singh appearing for the petitioner.This stand was supported by senior advocate Kapil Sibal who submitted that the Tamil Nadu government had appointed a Commission in the year 2020, by which, the exercise of including SCs/STs within the ambit of the 1993 law was continuing. According to him, the issue pertaining to Constitution 102nd Act, 2018 was very much involved in these matters and the same ought to go to the Constitution Bench.Also Read: SC to hear women officers' petitions for permanent commission in Army, NavySenior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, appearing for Tamil Nadu opposed the contention and submitted that as far as Tamil Nadu Act of 1993 is concerned, the same enjoyed special protection under Article 31B of the Constitution (Ninth Schedule) and the hearing on these writ petitions could await the outcome of the Constitution bench’s decision in Maratha quota case. He also pointed out that the TN quota law was enacted in 1993; whereas the Maharashtra Act, 2018 was enacted after the Constitution 102nd Amendment.The state pointed out to the Court that the Supreme Court in 1996 had allowed reservations under the 69% law to continue. Subsequently, the state had also produced quantifiable data to justify reservation under the 1993 law. But the petitioners were aggrieved that the reservation in admissions were being carried out without creating additional seats.

It said India’s fall “from the upper ranks of free nations could have a particularly damaging impact on global democratic standards”.There was no immediate response from Indian officials to the report.India had been rated as “free” in Freedom House’s reports for 2018, 2019 and 2020, though its scores on a scale of 100 had declined during this period from 77 to 71. In the latest report, India had a score of 67 out of 100.In 1973, Freedom House launched the Freedom in the World report, which assessed the level of freedom in each country and ranked them with a numerical score and declared them as “free”, “partly free” or “not free”. The annual report is perceived as one of the oldest quantitative measures of democracy. The latest report said political rights and civil liberties in India had deteriorated since 2014 because of increased pressure on human rights organisations, rising intimidation of academics and journalists, and a “spate of bigoted attacks, including lynchings, aimed at Muslims”.The decline accelerated in 2019, and the central government and its state-level allies “continued to crack down on critics” during 2020, while the response to the Covid-19 pandemic “included a ham-fisted lockdown that resulted in the dangerous and unplanned displacement of millions of internal migrant workers”.Rather than serving as a champion of democratic practice and a “counterweight to authoritarian influence from countries such as China”, the government and the ruling party are “tragically driving India itself toward authoritarianism”, the report said.Freedom House cited other incidents and developments that had led to the downgrade for India in the latest report, including the government intensifying its crackdown on protesters opposed to a the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and the arrest of dozens of journalists who aired criticism of the official pandemic response.“Judicial independence has also come under strain; in one case, a judge was transferred immediately after reprimanding the police for taking no action during riots in New Delhi that left over 50 people, mostly Muslims, dead,” the report said.While India remains a multiparty democracy, the government has “presided over discriminatory policies and increased violence affecting the Muslim population”, and the harassment of journalists, non-governmental organisations and other government critics has “increased significantly”.Freedom House gave high scores to India for the conduct of free and fair elections but expressed concern over the “opaque financing of political parties – notably through electoral bonds that allow donors to obscure their identities”. While political participation is “generally free”, Freedom House said “some political actors have sought to inflame communal tensions with the goal of energising their own supporters”.It also gave a low score to India over the ability of different segments of the population, including ethnic, racial and religious minorities, having full political rights and electoral opportunities.The report was extremely critical of China, describing it as the “world’s most populous dictatorship” and saying the “malign influence of the regime” in Beijing was “especially profound in 2020”. China “ramped up its global disinformation and censorship campaign to counter the fallout from its cover-up of the initial coronavirus outbreak, which severely hampered a rapid global response in the pandemic’s early days”, the report said.Beijing’s efforts “featured increased meddling in the domestic political discourse of foreign democracies, transnational extensions of rights abuses common in mainland China, and the demolition of Hong Kong’s liberties and legal autonomy”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-downgraded-from-free-to-partly-free-in-democracy-report-101614810847391.html

As we've said before, Secretary (of State Tony) Blinken has had a couple opportunities to speak to his Indian counterpart, both bilaterally and in the context of the Quad," Price said.The Quad, comprising India, the US, Australia and Japan, is aimed at ensuring a free and open Indo-Pacific, a region that has witnessed increasing Chinese military assertiveness in the recent years.The US has important relationships with India, as well as Pakistan, the spokesperson said, adding "these relationships stand on their own in our view.""They are not a zero-sum proposition when it comes to US foreign policy. We have productive, constructive relations, and productive and constructive relationships with one does not detract from the relationship we have at the other. It does not come at the expense of the relationship we have with the other," Price said."When it comes to India, we have a global comprehensive strategic partnership, and we've talked about that. When it comes to Pakistan, I addressed this the other week: We have important shared interests in the region. And we will continue to work closely with the Pakistani authorities on those shared interests," he said in response to a question.The US continues to support direct dialogue between India and Pakistan on Kashmir and other issues of concern, Price said. "Of course, we've continued to call for a reduction of tensions along the Line of Control (LoC), returning to that 2003 ceasefire," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/us-welcomes-steps-taken-to-return-j-k-to-full-economic-political-normalcy-101614825187169.html

It again began on Thursday morning. However, the crackdown on Anurag and Taapsee in an alleged tax evasion case did not surprise Maharashtra ministers, while some Bollywood personalities, including Swara Bhaskar, Anubhav Sinha, tweeted in support of Kashyap and Taaspsee.Maharashtra minister and NCP chief spokesperson Nawab Malik said, "Central agencies like ED, CBI, and Income Tax are being used to target those who take an anti-government stand and speak against the policies of the regime."PWD minister Ashok Chavan said this is not new. "We have been seeing this as happening often. Those who put forth facts are being pressurised in this way so that they don't speak up.""They work with so much vengeance. They don't want anyone to enjoy the freedom a democracy gives. For them, it is an autocratic rule and whatever they say is right and whatever others want to say is wrong," Maharashtra women and child development minister Yashomati Thakur said.Bollywood that crawls when asked to bend given Y+ securityBollywood that stands straight with farmers raided by ITShiv Sena leader Priyanka Chaturvedi termed the I-T department's present status as "bonded slavery".

But in reality, only 277 out of 422 have been granted permanent commission, 145 are those officers who are either non-optees or whose result is withheld due to medical or administrative reasons and 193 officers have been denied permanent commission, the petition said, according to ANI.In February 2020, the SC had ruled that all serving Short Service Commission (SSC) women officers should be entitled to permanent commission. It directed the army to give the permanent commission to its officers within three months, irrespective of the number of years they have spent in the armed forces.While SSC officers can stay in service for a specific period of 10-14 years, permanent commission allows them to work in the army till they retire. As part of the judgement, the SC had also ended the prohibition on women being considered for command appointments.Rejecting the army's argument that male soldiers, who mostly hailed from rural areas, were not “mentally schooled” to accept women officers in command of units, the two-judge SC bench comprising justices DY Chandrachud and Ajay Rastogi had said that such arguments were an insult to not only women, but also the Indian army.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-to-hear-women-officers-petitions-for-permanent-commission-in-army-navy-101614822241169.html

04-03-2021||India||2 held for murder of sexual assault survivor’s father||Two more accused in the Hathras murder case were arrested on Wednesday, hours after the Uttar Pradesh police announced a cash reward for providing information on the accused.Confirming the development, Hathras superintendent of police Vineet Jaiswal said, “Two of the accused Rohtash Sharma and Nikhil Sharma were arrested on Wednesday after reward was declared of ₹25,000 on each.”Earlier in the day, Agra zone additional director general of police Rajeev Krishna announced a cash reward of ₹1 lakh for information on the mail accused. “A reward of ₹1 lakh has been declared on the main accused Gaurav Sharma, who is absconding after killing 50-year-old Amreesh Sharma at Nojarpur village under the Sasni police station limits of Hathras district,” the ADG said.Amreesh Sharma was shot dead in Hathras district by accused against whom the deceased lodged a police case in July 2018 for molesting his daughter, the police said on Tuesday. The accused was out on bail and was pressurizing the family of the woman to withdraw the case.The incident happened on Monday and made headlines after a video of the 20-year-old woman pleading for justice went viral.“Of the four accused, Lalit Sharma is in police custody,” the ADG said. Lalit was arrested on Tuesday and the police produced him in a Hathras court, which then sent him to jail.The ADG has constituted teams of police personnel from Aligarh to assist the Hathras police. “Aligarh police are also in action to assist the Hathras police and additional teams have been constituted to nab the absconding accused. We hope that soon we would nab the culprits involved in the killing,” the ADG said.Chief minister Yogi Adityanath has ordered strict action in the case and directed officials to invoke provisions of the stringent National Security Act (NSA) against the accused.The video of the woman invoked strong reactions from the Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav who questioned the law-and-order situation in the state.In 2019, UP reported the most number of crimes against women, roughly one every 10 minutes, according to the National Crime Records Bureau. Experts say that uneven law enforcement, feudal attitudes and lack of education contribute to the lack of safety for women.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2-held-for-murder-of-sexual-assault-survivor-s-father-101614803657198.html
04-03-2021||India||Teen held for murder of girl after rape bid||A 17-year-old boy was detained on Wednesday for allegedly strangling a 17-year-old Dalit girl to death after she resisted a rape attempt in Uttar Pradesh’s Aligarh district, officials said on Wednesday.The incident took place on Sunday afternoon, when the girl went to a wheat field, owned by the family of the accused, to collect fodder and water.

04-03-2021||India||Only Centre can enforce new digital media rules: I&B ministry to states||The information and broadcasting ministry on Wednesday told all states and Union territories that no state official, district magistrate (DM) or police commissioner has the power to seek information from any media house under the new digital media rules unless information is sought by the central government.A district magistrate in Manipur on Tuesday withdrew a notice served by him to a talk show under the new rules framed and announced by the Centre last week. This came after the central government intervened and said that states did not have the power to issue such notices.The notice under the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021 notified on February 25, was issued on March 1 and served on Tuesday morning to the publisher/intermediary of Khanasi Neinasi, which means Let’s Talk in Manipuri. This was probably the first such action against digital news anywhere in the country — four days after a gazette notification on the new digital media rules were published — but the notice was later withdrawn.The provisions under the new rules relate to the code of ethics for digital news publishers, setting up of a grievance redressal system and the requirement of disclosure of information to Centre, the ministry said. “These powers have not been delegated to state governments/district magistrates/police commissioners,” it added. These rules have to be administered by the ministry of information and broadcasting, it clarified. The rules relate to publishers of digital news and current affairs and publishers of online curated content (Over the Top).On Monday, the Centre sent a letter to the chief secretary of Manipur, a day after Imphal West district magistrate Naorem Praveen Singh served a notice to Manipuri talk show Khanasi Neinasi under the new laws.The show was hosted on Facebook page of Kishorechandra Wangkhem, an Imphal-based journalist against whom the present Bharatiya Janata Party-led government in the state has slapped several cases since 2018 and who has been jailed three times.The DM directed the media outlet to furnish all relevant documents to ensure compliance with the provisions of the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021. The notice was withdrawn after the Centre’s remarks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/only-centre-can-enforce-new-digital-media-rules-i-b-ministry-to-states-101614802720823.html
04-03-2021||India||Spectrograph designed for Uttarakhand telescope||A team of scientists from the Aryabhatta Research Institute of observational sciences (ARIES), Nainital, with help from the Indian Space Research Organisation, have designed and developed a spectrograph, an instrument that separates incoming light by its wavelength or frequency and records the resulting spectrum.The instrument will support the 3.6 metre Devasthal Optical Telescope (DOT) in Uttarakhand, an official release from the department of science said on Wednesday.The instrument costs nearly ₹4 crores and has been named Aries-Devasthal Faint Object Spectrograph & Camera (ADFOSC), the release said. So far, such spectrographs were imported by the country and cost nearly 2.5 times more.The instrument can detect faint light sources from distant quasars and galaxies, regions around supermassive black holes, and cosmic explosions and forms.The instrument uses several lenses made of special glass that enable it to produce sharp images of the celestial objects, the release said. It can capture light sources with photon rate of less than one photon per second. A 100-watt bulb emits 10^20 photons in a second.Now, ARIES plans to commission more complex instruments such as spectro-polarimeter and high spectral resolution spectrograph on the telescope, the release said.Dr Amitesh Omar from the institute led this project with experts from various institutes including Isro.“The indigenous efforts to build complex instruments like ADFOSC in India is an important step to become ‘Aatmanirbhar’ in the field of astronomy and astrophysics,” said professor Dipankar Banerjee, Director, ARIES.A test set-up of the new instrument was used to study the Crab Pulsar, which is a relatively young neutron star (the collapsed core of supergiant stars), the release said.Inaugurated in 2016, the 3.6 metre DOT is the largest fully-steerable optical telescope in Asia, which was built in collaboration with Belgium. However, it is of global importance as it fills in the twelve-hour longitudinal gap between 4m class telescopes located at Canary Island in the West and Australia in the East. The observation time on the telescope is shared 60% on competitive basis to astronomers in any Indian institution, 33% to astronomers from ARIES, Nainital, and 7% to Belgian astronomers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/spectrograph-designed-for-uttarakhand-telescope-101614802330304.html
04-03-2021||India||‘Ceasefire need of the hour... desirable for both India, Pak’: Lt-Gen BS Raju||Calling the cessation of ceasefire violations between India and Pakistan on the Line of Control and the international border in Jammu and Kashmir a good beginning, Lt Gen BS Raju, General Officer Commanding of the Srinagar-based 15 Corps, says that it will help find ways to stop terrorism and look for durable ways to peace in the region. “We are committed to making it work in letter and in spirit and expect the same from Pakistan,” said the outgoing commander of the strategically situated army formation on the western border, days after India and Pakistan announced a surprise truce deal. In an exclusive interview with Ramesh Vinayak, Lt Gen Raju, who is set to take over as the Director General of Military Operations in New Delhi, spoke about the fallout of stopping of ceasefire violations on the militancy matrix in the Valley and army’s anti-terror operations. Edited excerpts:How will the ceasefire on the LoC impact the insurgency dynamics in Kashmir?This truce deal is desirable for both India and Pakistan and it is the need of the hour. The biggest beneficiaries will be the civilians living close to the LoC. It is a good start to look for ways to stop terrorism and look for durable ways to peace in the region. We are committed to making it work in letter and spirit and expect the same from Pakistan. The stopping of ceasefire violations will have an impact on the terror ‘tanzeems’ (outfits) in the hinterland. We take the ceasefire as an opportunity to form a potent anti-infiltration grid to deny any fresh attempts of terrorists to infiltrate from LoC. Denial of access to foreign terrorists, weapons and finance will help us create a better environment to control terrorism in the hinterland. A quiet LoC will allow us to address the challenge of terrorism in a focused manner; this involves focusing on the entire terrorism ecosystem that includes terrorists and their overground workers.What is your assessment of the current situation in Kashmir?It is stable and looking to get better. The security matrix has maintaining peace as the prime goal. Improving our ability to ensure better security is a work in progress where we are continuously reviewing and innovating to enhance our effectiveness. 2020 witnessed success in counterterror and counter-infiltration operations. Our estimates show that we are at lowest level of terrorist strength in Kashmir in a decade. The terrorists are also short of weapons and cash.What are the new trends/undercurrent in dynamics of Pakistan’s cross-border tactics to foment trouble in the Valley?Pakistan has been trying to infiltrate weapons, cash and cadres. Along with Kashmir, it is continuing efforts to use Jammu and even Punjab border. Regular recoveries, arrest of infiltrators and even tunnels on the international border are evidence of these attempts. Lately, even quadcopters (drones) are being used to drop in weapons. For cash, the narco-terror link is also now well-established. Effective policing and actions by the National Investigating Agency have been effective in targeting narco trade and controlling the cash flow for terror. Also, there are attempts to energise local recruitment in terror organisations. The figures are higher than 2019 but still at a manageable level. It is one area where we hope to make further impact. Our focus is , first, to prevent recruitment and second to provide options for those who have joined terror (outfits) to get a chance to get back to society. A beginning has been made and we have had a few successes. Pakistan’s desire to manifest terror in the Kashmir valley continues. It cannot accept a peaceful J&K. Since its ability to do kinetic or terrorist actions is being blunted, it is focusing more energies on propaganda all over the world. In part, the propaganda effort is to convince Pakistan’s own population that they are doing something while diverting attention from internal challenges.Second, conscious effort is on to create online proxies for Pakistan- based terrorist organisations such as LeT and JeM. Earlier it was The Resistance Front (TRF) and People’s Anti-Fascist Front (PAFF). In the last few weeks, we are seeing some new names appearing on social media. It is all linked to the Financial Action Task Force pressures and the desire to show that there is indigenous terror in J&K. The fact is that no terrorist organisation or even separatist has survived in Kashmir unless he is totally aligned to Pakistan. The “azadi” slogan is a fig leaf to fool the citizens of J&K. All terror organisations work under direct control of Pakistani handlers. We are clear that we have to counter Pakistani efforts both in the kinetic and information space. ate online proxies for Pakistan- based terrorist organisations such as LeT and JeM.

All terror organisations work under direct control of Pakistani handlers. We are clear that we have to counter Pakistani efforts both in the kinetic and information space.What have been the key tangible outcomes of the anti-terrorist grid in the Kashmir hinterland in the last one year?The anti-terrorist grid is critical to all our actions to get J&K back to peace, stability and prosperity. It gives us the ability to deny space to the terrorists. It is our prime responsibility that the citizens feel safe in doing their daily livelihood activities. We can see gradual opening of this space, despite Covid challenges. We can see people getting back to economic, cultural, sports and other activities.What is the current status of active terrorists/terror outfits operating in J&K?Over the past year, the terrorist leadership of all terrorist groups has been effectively targeted and eliminated. There is now a definite leadership void. The number of terrorists presently operating in the Valley is also reduced to the lowest in a decade. But they continue to have the capability to strike at soft targets – specially civilians. Last year witnessed 35 terrorist attacks on civilians. We are working to counter that threat. Pakistan has been constantly trying to falsely project emergence of new terror outfits such as TRF and PAFF. However, on ground, these outfits do not exist and is merely the IT Cell, which is active only on social media with an intent to shield terror outfit LeT and now, under some new names, JeM, Hizbul Mujahideen has suffered major losses and is presently weaker than it was probably was in 2019. There was an attempt to reactivate Al Badr but that has lost steam.In terms of locals versus foreigners, how has the terrorist mix evolved?Yes, this is important. The Pakistani terrorists hold finances and control over weapons; local terrorists are more for cannon fodder. As many as 39 local terrorists killed last year were with pistols. In contrast we get a good weapons and equipment haul whenever a Pakistani terrorist is killed. The number of Pakistani terrorists has been generally static since they have chosen to remain in the background and avoid contact with security forces. They are our preferred targets. The local terrorists’ numbers have been to some extent made up by fresh recruitment. This is our current focus area. We want them back into the mainstream. In all operations, we extend every opportunity to local terrorists to return. During the operation, if we get confirmation that a local terrorist is holed up, we try and identify them and then get their parents or elders to convince them to surrender. We are confident that this policy will yield positive results in the long-term.What have been the latest trends in infiltration and weapon smuggling from LoC in Kashmir? Has it shifted to the Jammu and Punjab borders?Pakistan has been exploring all options for infiltration for a long time. This has included the entire border of J&K and the northern parts of Punjab. With improved LoC surveillance, weapons smuggling has become a challenge for the Pakistan Army, hence they have been trying variety of things from tunnels to quadcopter drops to use of villages which are ahead of the LoC fence. Once weapons are infiltrated south of Banihal, they use local couriers, mostly trucks to transport the weapons to the terrorists in Kashmir valley. Recent cases of recoveries during checks in Banihal and interrogation of arrested personnel prove this modus operandi. We have enhanced checks on transport coming across Banihal and even on Mughal Road. This has led to recoveries of arms, equipment and drugs – establishing the narco-terror link.What has been the army’s response to the rising use of drones from across the border to drop weapons and drugs into the Indian side?Drones are a known challenge, from surveillance to now weapon drops. So far, weapon drops using drones has happened on a few occasions south of Pir Panjal. We are also conscious of this threat. We are in the process of upgrading our abilities to pick and bring down such drones. You will see the impact soon.What needs to improve in our security approach in Kashmir, intelligence, or operational capabilities, or local outreach and connect?We are looking at Kashmir with a holistic approach, encompassing all facets. It’s a long battle for change and we are not leaving any stone unturned. Intelligence is probably the biggest factor for the conduct of effective kinetic operations. Concurrently, outreach or connect with citizens is critical both for intelligence and ensuring denial of support structure to the terrorists. In conduct of kinetic operations, we are continuously innovating and upgrading to first give a chance to surrender and then act to eliminate the terrorist with minimum risk of collateral damage or risk to the troops.Technology provides options that we are continuously adopting to improve our methods.The army has been pushing for a policy to rehabilitate local boys who gave up the gun. But the policy has been in the works for a while. Any update?The rehabilitation policy is something that is a need. Our recommendations are with the government and are under consideration.How will the successful conduct of the district development council elections, the first political exercise in J&K since the abrogation of Article 370, impact the ground situation in the Valley?Any democratic activity is seen as a threat by Pakistan and its proxies in J&K. Providing security for the DDC elections was a challenge that was handled well. The next step is for the elected members to do their duties well. I’m sure these elections augur well for the future.What is your assessment on the possible fallout of withdrawal of American troops from Afghanistan on Kashmir?Withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan can open up possibilities of revival of some terrorist organisations. However, Af-Pak has always been tough to forecast. I would not hurry to read the future in Afghanistan. As far impact on J & K, this is not the 90s. There is limited influence that can be exercised by anyone from across the LoC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ceasefire-need-of-the-hour-desirable-for-both-india-pak-lt-gen-bs-raju-101614801729958.html

The six shut funds had an estimated ₹25,000 crore as assets under management.The ED will look into the money laundering aspect in the matter for which it will summon company executives.The story will be updated when comments from Franklin Templeton will be available.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ed-begins-probe-against-franklin-templeton-101614800613275.html
04-03-2021||India||Experts slam claim that human activity not behind Chamoli disaster||Experts on Wednesday criticised a statement by a top official of a research body under the DRDO who said human activity was “not the immediate cause” for the glacial breach and the deadly floods in Uttarakhand’s Chamoli district last month, and that there was a need to look at “demographic pressures”.Over 70 people died after the February 7 floods that occurred after a lake breached at Nanda Devi glacier in the upper reaches of Himalayas, triggering flash floods that hit Raini village and nearly washed away two hydropower plants downstream.The Defence Geo-Informatics Research Establishment – a premier research body under the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) that is studying the reasons for the February floods – said the tragedy was not “immediately” a human-induced disaster.But global warming and heating up of the Himalayas, which scientists say are decisively caused by human actions, could be the main reasons for the glacial breach in Chamoli district, Lokesh Kumar Sinha, director of DGRE, told HT at the body’s headquarters in Chandigarh.“There is a need to look upon the demographic pressures in a systematic way but as far as this particular tragedy is concerned in our preliminary investigations the role of human activity is not the immediate cause,” said Sinha. “It [glacial breach] was far away from the area where several constructions [NTPC hydel power project in Tapovan and Rishi Ganga hydel plant] are taking place,” Sinha added.Experts have repeatedly pointed out that glacial retreat due to climate crisis along with infrastructure projects such as dams could lead to large-scale disasters in the ecologically sensitive regions, while the proximity of human settlements could exacerbate loss of life and damage to property in Uttarakhand.Hemant Dhyani, member of the Supreme Court-appointed expert body to study the environmental impact of hydropower projects after the deadly 2013 Kedarnath floods, questioned how the February disaster was not linked to human activity.“Tragedy happened because over 200 people were working in two dams quite close to the glacial region. Had these dams not been here, the flash floods would have subsided without any loss to life and property”, he said.Dhyani added that the burden on the ecology due to construction on Himalayan slopes made the region prone to disasters.“And our expert body had also said that these paraglacial zones (sediment hot spots in Himalayas close to the glaciers) are vulnerable areas and warned that such disasters can take place in these areas...” he said. The environmental activist was referring to another SC-appointed committee, of which he was a part and which had recommended against development projects in the Rishi Ganga catchment area in 2014. But all recommendations of the panel were not accepted by the government. “The Chamoli tragedy happened because they built dams so close to the glaciers. And this is the main human trigger in this tragedy,” said Anil Joshi, founder of Dehradun-based NGO Himalayan Environmental Studies and Conservation Organization (HESCO).Experts echoed their views.“It’s a preposterous statement. The official is belittling the tragedy... How can one ignore the impact of human induced climate change on the Himalayas... Any more unplanned construction or anthropogenic pressure on Uttarakhand will be suicidal,” said Mallika Bhanot of the Ganga Ahvaan NGO.Professor Anil Kulkarni of the Divecha Center for Climate Change at the Indian Institute of Science also cautioned there was a need to study the issue first. “We need to study the issue very critically before passing any judgement on this disaster. What was the distance between the Rishi Ganga power plant and the ice or rock which fell? Whether during the construction phase the project caused any micro-tremors? We don’t know anything yet and there should be scientific rigour in investigation before concluding anything,” said Kulkarni.On Wednesday, Sinha also said, “There are certain indications before such disasters take place and for forecasting them we need to develop gadgets which can map such indications...”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/experts-slam-claim-that-human-activity-not-behind-recent-flood-101614799919874.html
04-03-2021||India||Supreme Court issues notice on Gautam Navlakha’s plea for default bail||The Supreme Court on Wednesday issued notice on a petition filed by civil rights activist Gautam Navlakha seeking default bail in a case pertaining to the Bhima-Koregaon violence being probed by the National Investigation Agency (NIA).A bench of Justices UU Lalit and KM Joseph issued notice to NIA and posted the matter for hearing on March 15. Navlakha claimed in his petition filed through advocate Shadan Farasat that the 90-day period for filing of charge sheet was over and he was entitled to default bail under Section 167(2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC).Earlier, the Bombay High Court had on February 8 rejected the plea of the activist, who is facing serious charges under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act for his alleged links with banned Maoist organization – Communist Party of India (Maoist).Navlakha stated in his petition that the 34 days of detention under house arrest should also be calculated as part of the custody undergone by him for the purposes of Section 167(2) CrPC.Senior advocate Kapil Sibal who appeared for Navlakha submitted that the 34 days period from August 28, 2018 to October 1, 2018 was crucial to his custody, in addition to the 11 days police custody (April 14, 2020 to April 25, 2020) and 46 days of judicial custody (April 25, 2020 to June 10, 2020).The HC refused to accept this plea. It had said that the order of keeping Navlakha under house arrest was already declared “illegal” by the Delhi High Court and hence this unlawful detention cannot be added under the period of arrest.Navlakha was first arrested in connected with this case in August 2018 when the case was probed by the Maharashtra Police. After NIA took over the probe last year, Navlakha surrendered in April 2020.The HC said, “It is not possible for us to fathom a situation where detention of the appellant (Navlakha) though held to be illegal and unlawful rendering the authorization by the Magistrate untenable should still be construed as an authorized detention for the purpose of Section 167(2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure.”During the period of house arrest, he was not allowed to meet anybody and even the NIA did not have access to him. Further, the HC observed that the period of house arrest from August 28-October 10, 2018 cannot be treated as detention for purposes of investigation that resulted in deprivation of his personal liberty.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-issues-notice-on-gautam-navlakha-s-plea-for-default-bail-101614798844765.html

Lama runs a private school at Namchi in south Sikkim.Pravin Gurung, deputy inspector general of Sikkim Police said, “Lama was arrested on Wednesday from Namchi. A complaint was lodged against him on Wednesday under the POCSO Act. He will be produced before a magistrate within 24 hours.”The DIG did not divulge the details of the complaint.After the arrest, Lama was admitted in a district hospital since his blood pressure shot up.Lama was being considered as the GJM candidate for the Kalimpong assembly seat in the coming polls, party leaders, who described the arrest as a setback, said, “The arrest comes at a time when the GJM’s Gurung faction is struggling to rejuvenate its ranks in the Darjeeling hills.”Gurung, as well as Benoy Tamang, leader of the other faction of the GJM, are supporting Mamata Banerjee though the two hill leaders are political rivals.Gurung went into hiding in 2017 after he was charged under the anti-terror law by the state government because of the violence witnessed during the Gorkhaland stir. After coming out of hiding in October last year Gurung said he will no longer support the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) which won the Darjeeling Lok Sabha seat thrice since 2009 with his support. The Bengal government has started withdrawing the criminal charges against him.Lama was at the helm of affairs in GJM when Gurung was on the run for almost three-and-a-half years. Lama was also the deputy chairman of the Gorkhaland Territorial Administration (GTA) for almost five years since 2012. He was elected to the GTA from the Rongo-Todaytangta area.Roshan Giri, general secretary of the GJM (Gurung faction) said, “I cannot comment on his attest without knowing the details of the case.”After Lama’s arrest, the Tamang faction targeted Gurung on social media. “The arrest is a big shock for the GJM (Gurung faction) before the assembly election,” said one of the posts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gjm-leader-close-to-bimal-gurung-arrested-under-pocso-in-sikkim-101614797598594.html
04-03-2021||India||Centre differs with SC on additional courts for cheque bounce cases||The Centre on Wednesday refused to play ball with the Supreme Court on a crucial reform suggestion to set up additional courts for expeditious trial of cheque bounce cases.The top court which is examining measures to fast-track cheque bounce cases in a suo moto proceeding had on February 25 sought the view of the Centre to create additional courts for exclusive trial of offences under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments (N.I) Act. The Court cited Article 247 of the Constitution which empowers Parliament to create additional courts for better administration of laws.In response, the Centre presented a three-page document comprising an Office Memorandum dated March 2, 2021 issued by the Department of Financial Services (DFS) and a two-page note attached with it.The note altogether dismissed the suggestion for creating additional courts. It said, “One of the major factors for high pendency is delay in ensuring the presence of the accused before the Court for trial. It is understood that most cases are pending due to absence of the accused. Under such circumstances, it is not clear how additional specific courts would provide a solution to the problem of a large number of pending cases.”Not happy with the response, the bench headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde asked Solicitor General Tushar Mehta to appear in the case along with Additional Solicitor General (ASG) Vikramjeet Banerjee, who presented the note to the Court.The bench, also comprising Justices L Nageswara Rao and S Ravindra Bhatt recorded in its order, “Prima facie we are of the view that the aforesaid Article 247 (of Constitution of India) confers a power coupled with duty on the Union of India to establish additional courts, for better administration of laws made by Parliament. There is no doubt or dispute about the fact that matters under the N.I Act have posed what by now has become an intractable problem, accounting for close to 30 to 40 per cent of the pendency in the trial courts and a very high percentage in High Courts as well.”The note prepared by DFS said, “Instead of setting up additional special courts, certain measures may be considered to reform the existing processes…To address the concerns that many accused attempt to obtain stay and adjournment on flimsy grounds, Supreme Court may consider capping the maximum number of hearings, and if the accused does not appear despite the measures mentioned above, then the passing of ex-parte may be considered by the (trial) court.”The note said that the root cause of delay in deciding cheque bounce cases was delay tactics employed by accused that could be resolved by measures such as levying penalty on non-appearance of accused, using coercive methods to secure presence of accused by way of attachment of property, deemed appearance despite repeated service of summons.Reacting to these suggestions, the bench noted in its order, “Having gone through the measures and heard learned counsel on the said measures, we find that the measures are, to say the least, inadequate for the purpose.”The bench asked ASG Banerjee, “In 30 per cent of cheque bounce cases, trial is help up as the accused is not being served summons. If you have come up with this suggestion to secure the presence of accused and hearing the case ex-parte, what is the solution…In this country, is it possible to have a trial with the accused in absentia. Cases are pending in our courts for this reason for over 15 to 20 years.”As no solution was forthcoming, the bench proposed forming a Committee headed by a retired High Court judge having vast experience as a trial judge and asked Centre to suggest names of bureaucrats from the concerned Central Ministries to be part of the Committee. The Court posted the matter for hearing on Thursday.The suggestion to set up additional courts for trial of Section 138 of N.I Act cases formed part of a preliminary report prepared by Court-appointed amici curiae senior advocate Sidharth Luthra and advocate K Parameshwar in October 2020.Though the Act prescribes a six-month deadline for completion of trial in a cheque bounce offence, a case under Section 138 NI Act on an average takes three years and eight months to be decided, the report prepared by the amici curiae stated. Increase in institution of cheque bounce complaints and failure to serve summons on the accused were identified as the chief causes behind the backlog.Their report stated that as on January 1, 2020, out of over 2.31 crore (over 20 million) criminal cases pending in the country, cheque bounce cases accounted for almost 15 per cent. One of their suggestions to speed up disposal of cheque bounce cases included creation of additional exclusive courts.In addition, they pressed for a major overhaul in the court processes by way of electronic service of summons, summary trial of cheque bounce cases, compulsory mediation at the pre-trial stage, and attachment of property of accused to the extent of the amount presented in the cheque.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-differs-with-sc-on-additional-courts-for-cheque-bounce-cases-101614796853190.html

However, he withdrew the letter on Wednesday after he was convinced that his plan would not help in getting rid of his physical problem.Satish Deshmukh, assistant account officer with the district collectorate had written to collector Vipin Itankar seeking the permission on Wednesday.“I have decided to buy a horse to come to the office, as I cannot ride my bike due to a spinal problem. Kindly grant me the permission to tie the horse on the office premises,” Deshmukh wrote in his letter.The letter went viral on social media within hours of its submission. But before the day was over, the officer was convinced by medical advice that his demand would rather cause him more problems.“We sought the opinion from the dean of the district medical college. We consulted an orthopaedic surgeon from the college. The report said that his demand was against the medical science and would not serve any purpose for which he wants to buy a horse. He was convinced with the report and sought permission to withdraw the request which was given to him,” said Pradeep Kulkarni, resident deputy collector, Nanded.Deshmukh was not available for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/man-in-maharashtra-wanted-to-ride-horse-to-office-to-overcome-spinal-problem-101614796371065.html

It will also act as a “legal framework for the procurement under the government-to-government modality”, he said.There was no official word from the Indian side on the development.Hindustan Times had first reported last November that India and the Philippines are looking to sign an agreement on the BrahMos cruise missile this year, making the Southeast Asian country the first customer for the weapons system developed jointly by New Delhi and Moscow.At the time, the two sides were working to sort out a few remaining issues for the deal to supply the missiles to the Philippines Army’s first Land Based Missile System Battery, people familiar with developments had said on condition of anonymity.The actual agreement on the missiles is expected to be inked during a meeting of leaders of the two countries this year.Russian officials have also said India and Russia are working to gradually increase the range of the BrahMos and begin exporting the missile to third countries, starting with the Philippines.The Philippines Army zeroed in on the BrahMos after extensive trials and much of the negotiations have revolved around the cost of the system and financing for the deal. India has offered a $100-million line of credit to the Philippines for defence purchases.India has also been in talks with several Southeast Asian countries, including Thailand, Indonesia and Vietnam, over the past few years to sell them land and sea-based versions of the BrahMos.The draft defence production policy of 2018 set an ambitious target of achieving defence exports worth $5 billion by 2025.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-signs-pact-with-philippines-for-supply-of-brahmos-missile-101614795752832.html
04-03-2021||India||Govt allows 24x7 vaccination as surge continues in six states||Union health minister Harsh Vardhan said on Wednesday the government has allowed coronavirus vaccinations to work 24x7 for the convenience of beneficiaries, a step he said was meant to ease the process for people.Hospitals welcomed the move, saying segregated timings would mean less crowding.“People can get vaccinated 24x7 as per their convenience as Prime Minister Narendra Modi understands the value of both time and health of citizens,” the minister tweeted in Hindi.“Most hospitals anyway work 24x7, like ours, so they can also offer vaccine shots. It makes sense to leave the slots open ended especially for working professionals who do not have any fixed timings and prefer early mornings or late nights,” said Dr Anupam Sibal, group medical director, Apollo Hospitals.The Union health ministry has been making modifications to the vaccination process since it was opened for the general public on March 1 to suit the needs of the elderly and those with comorbidities.“We made changes to the Co-WIN application to make it more convenient for general population as they can choose the hospital, date and even time slot for vaccination. As we progress, there will be more changes made based on the feedback to make it as easy for people to take the shot as possible,” said RS Sharma, chairman, empowered group on Covid-19 vaccination.The Union government has also allowed states to increase the number of private hospitals as Covid vaccination centres by including facilities outside of the network empanelled under Ayushman Bharat scheme, central government health insurance scheme, and other state insurance schemes.“There are at least four states that have not signed up for the Ayushman Bharat scheme. It is better if states see their requirement and expand the list of Covid vaccination centres to include those that fulfil the criteria,” said Sharma.At least 16 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines have been administered to people till Wednesday evening as per the government data. Government is urging eligible persons to come forward and get vaccinated as cases in some parts of the country are seeing a rise.Six states in India currently contribute nearly 86% of the new cases of coronavirus disease (Covid-19), government data showed.The states, Maharashtra, Kerala, Punjab, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat and Karnataka also continue to report a surge in the daily new cases.On Wednesday, 14,989 new cases were registered from across the country, of which Maharashtra has reported the highest daily new cases at 7,863. Maharashtra is followed by Kerala with 2,938 cases, while Punjab reported 729 new cases.According to the Union ministry of health and family welfare, Maharashtra, Punjab, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Delhi, Haryana and Karnataka have shown the maximum increase in new cases on a week on week basis.“Maharashtra alone accounted for a weekly increase of 16,012 cases, in terms of the number of cases. In percentage terms, Punjab reported the weekly increase of 71.5% (1,783 cases),” said health ministry in a statement.Central teams that have been rushed to these states, to assist local authorities in managing the situation, are trying to get to the cause, and initial observation says large gatherings and drop in overall testing could have led to the surge.“It is a season of weddings, and people tend to gather in large numbers on such occasions and also there is somewhat laxity in observing Covid-19 appropriate behaviour. Another reason could be drop in overall testing as some of the states where there has been seen a surge, Covid-19 testing relatively went down. The teams have been directed to brief the state authorities in detail about the reasons so that the situation can be managed accordingly,” said a senior government official in the know of things, who did not wish to be identified.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-allows-24x7-vaccination-as-surge-continues-in-six-states-101614795452793.html

It was received by its Canadian partner Verity Pharmaceuticals, located in the Greater Toronto Area town of Mississauga.Delivery of the first tranche of a total of two million doses scheduled by mid-May was announced by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.During a media interaction, he said, “Very early this morning, our first half a million doses of the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine from the Serum Institute arrived in Canada. Already, the national operations centre has worked with provinces and territories to coordinate shipments of these vaccines across the country. Our priority is to get doses into arms as soon as possible.”Canada’s minister of public services & procurement Anita Anand and India’s high commissioner to Ottawa Ajay Bisaria were present for the receipt of the batch of vaccine. “Thank you to all whose hard work made this happen. We look forward to future collaboration,” Anand tweeted. In a statement, Bisaria said, “India is proud to support Canada’s vaccination program. With more than 60 percent of global vaccine manufacturing capacity, India believes in vaccine internationalism and is providing a healing hand as the world recovers from this deadly pandemic.”  The shipment has an expiry date of about a month from now and Canadian public health authorities are accelerating the process of getting the doses distributed and administered across the country.Health Canada had given authorisation to the SII product last week. Canada is the first Western nation and the only G7 country to receive vaccines from India under the government’s Vaccine Maitri initiative.The AstraZeneca vaccine is the third shot to have been cleared by Canada after those made by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna. Canada will receive a total of 22 million doses of the AstraZeneca inoculation, which includes the consignment from India.Trudeau had called Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in February with a request for vaccines and the Indian PM had then took to Twitter to say that he “was happy to receive a call from my friend, @JustinTrudeau”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-canada-receives-500-doses-of-made-in-india-covishield-vaccine-101614795096065.html
04-03-2021||India||Centre proposes to take over mine auction, some states oppose||The Union mines ministry has proposed amendments to the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957, allowing captive mine owners to sell up to 50% of the approved capacity in the open market and also giving itself the power to auction mines that the states have failed to auction.The changes have been opposed by some states that see it as another attempt by the Centre to take over mining auctions and impose central rules on a matter in state domain. Except for coal, states are allowed to auction other mines in consultation with the mines ministry. Parliament in September 2020 approved an Ordinance promulgated in June to improve revenue from the mining sector and the Centre now wants states to carry out these changes too.In a note to amend the law circulated to all states, the mines ministry said the new amendments have been proposed in the law after consultation with Union ministries and state governments to improve revenue from the mining sector and to reduce dependence on imports.The ministry has proposed a new provision in the law to allow sale of 50% of minerals from captive mines in open market after meeting the need of the plant with which the mining block is attached.Under the captive mines scheme, the mineral can be mined only for the plant to which it is attached. No royalty is charged for minerals mined from captive mines.With the change in law, the government is looking at increasing production, especially from the captive coal mines. There are 194 captive coal blocks in India that were auctioned between 1993 and 2011, and which have coal reserves of 44 billion tonnes.“This (market sale) will help to increase production of coal from captive mines, increase coal availability in the market leading to reduction in import of coal. This will also ensure additional revenue to the states and lead to Atmanirbhar (self-reliant) Bharat,” the ministry’s proposal said.India has the world’s fifth-largest known coal reserves, or nearly 10% of global reserves, and is the world’s second-largest producer of the mineral. There has been increasing demand from climate change activists that India should declare a deadline year by which it will stop using coal. China has already said that it will stop doing so by 2050.To improve revenue, the ministry has fixed up to 2.5 times of the existing royalty for allowing commercial sales from the captive mines. A decision on how much mineral from each captive mine can be sold will be taken by the mines and coal ministries, the note says.Licence holders currently pay a royalty of ₹50 to ₹250 for a tonne of coal depending on its quality and ₹800 per tonne of asbestos. For several other minerals, the royalty is charged on ad valorem (percentage of the sale price) basis as per the rates published by Indian Bureau of Mines. The ad valorem royalty ranges from 0.4% per tonne for bauxite to 12% for copper.A mines ministry official said that streamlining of the auctions would help in better utilisation of mines and ensure flow of minerals for industries to improve production. “There are many indirect benefits as it improves overall tax collections for the Centre and states and also creates additional employment avenues,” he said.The ministry justified changes in the auction rules saying that it would “ensure continuous supply of minerals in the country and more number of mineral blocks are required to be brought under auction on a regular basis.” Any delay in auction will have substantial impact on the availability as well as prices of minerals, the note said.Another amendment proposed is to empower the Central government to auction mines, which the states have failed to auction. Of the 143 such mines listed for auctioning, states have auctioned only 7 since 2015, the amendment said. According to mines ministry officials, the states were getting about ₹10,000 crore as revenue from these mines.“Further, mining lease in relation to 334 blocks expired on 31 March 2020, out of which 46 are working mines. The Ministry of Mines is pursuing with the state governments since early 2019 for early auction of these blocks ensuring continuity in production of minerals. Only 28 blocks have been auctioned till date,” added the ministry.A ministry official who was not willing to be named said that the delay in auctioning by the states is causing a huge revenue loss to the states. “The Centre wants to help the states to get their money, especially in the time of pandemic when the revenue has gone down and expenditure has increased for state governments. The mining reforms are aimed at ease of doing business and improve foreign direct investment in the mineral sector,” the official added.Some states have opposed the proposal.A senior official of Chhattisgarh's mining department said there are various reasons, including the feasibility of a mine and the net mineable reserves as against the estimated resources in a mine and market conditions apart from the time needed for technical preparations, for delay in mine auctions. “Like Centre, every state is interested in auction of mines but limitations are there for both Centre and the state. Under cooperative federalism, the states should be allowed to exercise their right to bring their mines to auction after considering all the associated parameters,” he said.On the mines ministry’s proposal, Shankar Sinha, Jharkhand’s director, Mines, said, “The state government was finalising its own policy on the issues listed in the mines ministry’s proposal. Once that is done, we would send our suggestions to the Central government. Jharkhand government in June 2020 moved Supreme Court against the Centre’s decision to auction coal blocks for commercial mining in several states without taking states on board as it would have adverse impact on local population and price fetched may not be adequate.Odisha mines minister Prafulla Mallik said they have reservations on certain provisions of the proposed changes in the law as it takes away the state power to auction mines. “We have questions regarding why the Centre wants to take over auctions and have sought clarifications,” he said, while supporting the ministry’s proposal to hike rates for sale of minerals from captive mines. Odisha mines secretary Surendra Kumar said the state has already sent its reply to the mines ministry.Also Read: Goa ecologists, miners oppose Centre’s proposed amendments to mining actIn Goa, the Goa Mining People’s Front, a collective of Mine Worker Unions has also opposed the proposal. “The Centre taking over the auctioning could lead to legal hurdles in resuming mining in Goa, which is stuck since 2018 when the Supreme Court cancelled all mining leases,” said Puti Gaonkar, the president of the GMPF. The Goa Mineral Ore Exporters Association (GMOEA), an association of mine owners, has also written to the ministry opposing the proposal giving powers to the Centre to auction mines.Reacting to the proposal, Goa Foundation Director Claude Alvares, said the Centre forcibly auctioning the mines at less than market value would amount to ‘cheating’, while referring to mineral resources as a shared inheritance, owned by state governments as a trustee for the people.“How would states then fulfil their duties as public trustees to conserve the shared inherited mineral wealth if they have no control over it. How would states meet intergenerational equity? These proposals violate the principle of subsidiary and the federal structure of our Constitution,” he said.(With inputs from Vishal Kant in Raipur, Debabrata Mohanty in Bhubaneswar and Ritesh Mishra in Raipur)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-propose-to-take-over-mine-auction-some-states-oppose-101614757311685.html

But the health ministry has clarified that the registration process is going on smoothly. The initial hiccups were primarily because there was a huge load on the site and also because many people thought that an app will have to be downloaded.Here are five things that you must keep in mind while booking an appointment on Co-win> There is no app for self-registration. The process has to be done on cowin.gov.in website.> You can add three more people from one mobile number. So, four people can be added using one mobile number.> Once you book your appointment for vaccination, you will receive an SMS with the appointment details on your mobile number. Apart from that, confirmation details will flash on the screen, which can be downloaded. The confirmation details too should be saved.> Rescheduling of appointment can be done through Co-Win site, but it has to be done before the vaccination appointment day.
