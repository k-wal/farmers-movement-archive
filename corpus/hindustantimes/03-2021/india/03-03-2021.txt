This came after the central government intervened and said that states did not have the power to issue such notices.The notice under the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021 notified on February 25, was issued on March 1 and served on Tuesday morning to the publisher/intermediary of Khanasi Neinasi, which means Let’s Talk in Manipuri. This was probably the first such action against digital news anywhere in the country — four days after a gazette notification on the new digital media rules were published – but the notice was later withdrawn.The provisions under the new rules relate to the code of ethics for digital news publishers, setting up of a grievance redressal system and the requirement of disclosure of information to Centre, the ministry said. “These powers have not been delegated to state governments/district magistrates/police commissioners,” it added. These rules have to be administered by the ministry of information and broadcasting, it clarified. The rules relate to publishers of digital news and current affairs and publishers of online curated content (Over the Top).On Monday, the Centre sent a letter to the chief secretary of Manipur, a day after Imphal West district magistrate Naorem Praveen Singh served a notice to Manipuri talk show Khanasi Neinasi under the new laws.The show was hosted on Facebook page of Kishorechandra Wangkhem, an Imphal-based journalist against whom the present Bharatiya Janata Party-led government in the state has slapped several cases since 2018 and who has been jailed three times.The DM directed the media outlet to furnish all relevant documents to ensure compliance with the provisions of the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021. The notice was withdrawn after the Centre’s remarks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/only-centre-can-enforce-new-digital-media-rules-i-b-ministry-to-states-101614795512792.html
03-03-2021||India||Odisha govt deploys 1000 men to contain huge blaze in Similipal National Park||The Odisha government on Wednesday engaged a team of over 1,000 people, including 750 forest guards and deployed 40 vehicles including fire tenders and 240 blowers to the Similipal biosphere reserve in Mayurbhanj district as a massive fire in 8 of the forest ranges raging for more than 10 days threatened to engulf the wildlife species and medicinal plants there.Odisha forest and environment minister Bikram Arukha said he has instructed the principal chief conservator of forests to ascertain the cause of the fire and bring it under control quickly. “Similipal is the pride of our state. Action is being taken by involving local people to protect our forest,” he said and asked the PCCF to submit a report to the state government by Thursday.The fire in Similipal biosphere came as Odisha topped the list of forest fire incidents with 6627 fire spots since February 24 as per the Forest Survey of India’s fire alerts system based on SNPP (Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership and observations from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). Telangana came a distant second with 1769 fires in the same time. Odisha also saw 8991 number of forests fires since November 1 last year, the highest among all the states.Similipal, among the few included by the UNESCO in its list of critical biosphere reserves of the world, covers an area of 5569 sq km and contributes 38% of the total protected area network in Odisha. It is the sixth largest biosphere reserve, one of the oldest tiger reserves in the country and a major biodiversity hotspot in Eastern India. The biosphere has the largest zone of Sal trees in the entire country. Its distinctive biodiversity contains 1,076 species of plants including 93 species of orchids, 300 species of medicinal plants and 52 species of endangered flora. It has also 42 species of mammals, 264 bird species, 39 reptile species and 12 amphibian species.The fire in Similipal which started in the Kaptipada range of the biosphere reserve in Mayurbhanj on February 9, soon spread to ranges like Upper Barahkamuda, Jenabil, Nawna South, Nawna North, Pithabata, Bhanjabasa and Thakurmunda range, alleged environmental activists working at the reserve.Vanoomitra Acharya, a conservationist working at Similipal said though tribals set fire to the dried leaves on the forest floor ahead of collecting the Mahua flowers, this year the poachers are behind the endless spate of fires. “Poachers are on a rampage inside the tiger reserve and they are setting fire to the bushes and the dried leaves so as to scare the animals like wild boars and barking deer to run in the opposite direction. They then shoot the animals with bows and arrows or pellet guns. While poachers were running amok, the forest officials did not do any patrolling. Forest fire incidences could have been reduced drastically with future planning and using modern technologies, but nothing of that sort was done in Similipal,” alleged Acharya, adding that the fire destroyed hundreds of bushes, medicinal plants and orchids for which the biosphere is famous.Regional chief conservator of forest of Baripada, M Yogajayananda, however said the fire may have been triggered by someone's negligence. “For more than a week, Baripada and the area nearby is experiencing temperatures of 40 degree Celsius. Unlike last year, this year there has been no rain in winter season leading to dry weather in the lower atmosphere which helped spread the fire quickly. The thick blanket of leaves on the forest floor has helped the fire to spread. But the core area of the tiger reserve has not been affected. It's only the villages in the fringe area that have been hit, but we are trying hard to bring the fire under control,” said Yogajayananda.Though the fire has been raging for more than 10 days, it did not come to public notice till erstwhile princess of Mayurbhanj royal family Akshita Bhanj Deo wrote about it on social media following which Union minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas Dharmendra Pradhan expressed his concern and requested Union forest and environment minister Prakash Javadekar and chief minister Naveen Patnaik to take action. Javadekar later tweeted that he has asked his officials to take immediate action and report to him.Bhanj Deo said it was a matter of concern that no one took the forest fire seriously and the chief minister was tweeting about world wildlife day. “It's ironic that he was tweeting about wildlife day when Similipal was burning. Mayurbhanj is completely dependent on Similipal due to the forest and the rivers that emanate from hills in the region. The fire and the resultant smoke has been affecting not just the wild animals, but people living on the fringes. A few days ago, an auto-rickshaw carrying passengers collided with a truck as the drivers could not see each other due to the smoke. As the fire rages on, I am not sure how many wild animals have perished and what medicinal plants have been lost. I am worried whether we have lost the melanistic tiger and elephants to the fire. Army should have been requisitioned to contain the fire and the conservationists from Bhubaneswar could have been consulted on ways to protect the wildlife. Despite what officials say there has been very little action on the ground,” Bhanj Deo said.The CMO which undertook a review of the situation this evening said the forest fire is under control. “No loss of life or major damage to big trees has been reported. PCCF (Wildlife) has made spot visits to take stock of the situation. SOP has been issued to deal with the situation,” the CMO said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-govt-deploys-1000-men-to-contain-huge-blaze-in-similipal-national-park-101614793853215.html

Any detection of false medical certificate will entail action against the concerned Registered Medical Practitioner as well as the person producing such false medical certificate in support of the specified co-morbidities,” said the health department’s letter to all district collectors, municipal commissioners directors under health and family welfare department, superintendents of all government MCHs, all chief district medical officers (CDMOs) and public health officers (PHOs).Till Wednesday, 56,033 people in the age group of 45-59 years with co-morbidities and those above 60 years have taken the first dose of the vaccine in Odisha.The union health ministry last week had specified 20 comorbidities among people aged between 45 and 59 years who will get the vaccine. The certificate of comorbidity, signed by any registered medical practitioner, can either be uploaded on Co-WIN 2.0 by the beneficiary while self-registering or a hard copy can be carried by the beneficiary to the Covid Vaccination Centres.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-warns-people-against-fake-co-morbidity-certificates-for-covid-19-vaccine-101614793411224.html

03-03-2021||India||Haryana clears 75% quota for local candidates in private sector||Haryana governor Satyadeo Narain Arya on Tuesday gave his assent to a controversial bill granting 75% quota in private sector jobs to state residents, fulfilling a key election promise of the ruling coalition and joining a growing group of states that reserve jobs for local candidates.The Haryana State Employment of Local Candidates Bill, 2020, provides quota for local people in private sector jobs with a monthly salary of less than ₹50,000 for 10 years. The legislation applies to companies, societies, trusts, limited liability partnership firms and partnership firms employing 10 or more people in Haryana.The law is expected to have a major impact on Gurugram, an information technology, medical and manufacturing hub that powers the state economy. The city is home to a number of large national and international firms, thousands of start-ups and the local offices of at least 250 Fortune 500 companies.“The bill will provide tremendous benefits to private employers directly or indirectly through qualified and trained local work force. Availability of suitable workforce locally would enhance the efficiency of industry as the workforce is one of the major components for the development of any industrial organisation,’’ the bill read.Legal experts said the law was in contravention of the Constitution and was unlikely to withstand judicial scrutiny.Deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala, who made the job quota a central plank of his election campaign in 2019, described the assent as the “happiest moment for the youth of Haryana”. “The government will notify it soon,” chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar told reporters.Last July, the state cabinet approved a near-similar ordinance but withdrew it in October after failing to get the assent of the governor. Earlier, the Union labour and employment ministry, which examined the ordinance, advised the state government against enacting such a law.Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh have already announced plans to reserve some quantum of private jobs for local candidates.The law will benefit a candidate who is domiciled (has their place of residence) in Haryana. As per an amended January order, children or dependents of people who have permanent home in Haryana and people who have been residing in Haryana for a period of not less than five years or who have permanent home in Haryana but on account of their occupation are living outside Haryana will be eligible for grant of resident certificate.All kinds of unskilled, semi-skilled and skilled jobs where gross monthly salary is not more than ₹50,000 will come under the ambit of the law. The law will not be applicable retrospectively and provides for imposition of financial penalty for violations.Apart from tackling unemployment among local people, the state government said the law will discourage the influx of migrants seeking low-paid jobs, which has a “significant impact” on local infrastructure and leads to the “proliferation of slums”.When tabling the bill in the assembly on November 5, 2020, the government amended a crucial section that earlier said the quota law will override “any other law”. The modified provision said the new law will override any other “state law”.Legal experts said the law was in contravention of Article 14 and Article 19 (1)(g) of the Constitution.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/haryana-clears-75-quota-for-local-candidates-in-private-sector-101614789661889.html

The group claimed that the peace talk teams are back on the table and negotiations are progressing.RN Ravi’s statements and conclusions, the group claimed, reflected his role as Nagaland Governor and not as the interlocutor.The NSCN (IM) stated it was regrettable that Ravi’s role as interlocutor has become “nothing less than disparaging and dismal”. It asserted that the status of the Naga political talks was, as confirmed by the union government during the last parliamentary session, in an advanced stage."It is very unfortunate of RN Ravi to have made such a misleading statement before the whole nation by blatantly contradicting the Centre and the Indian Parliament besides the 136 crore Indians and the world community in the matter of such sensitive Indo-Naga political negotiations which have been going on for more than two decades," the NSCN (IM) stated.The outfit underscored that the Naga peace talks are being handled by both the government of India and the NSCN (IM) to take the Naga people and the Centre to a point that is “honourable and acceptable”.It maintained that the historic framework agreement signed on August 3, 2015 between the Centre and the NSCN (IM) was being revived in order to remove any misinterpretation and thereby hasten the signing of Naga solution agreement.“This is the official understanding and the only way to conclude the talk,” the statement said, adding that the NSCN (IM), under no circumstance, would fail the Naga people by signing any agreement that is short of “the mutual standard as agreed upon”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/reckless-naga-group-on-governor-rn-ravi-s-peace-talks-concluded-statement-101614788838479.html

03-03-2021||India||NIA starts probe in Bengal railway station blast that injured minister||A team of the National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Wednesday began a probe into the blast that injured West Bengal’s deputy labour minister Jakir Hossain and 22 Trinamool Congress (TMC) workers at Nimtita railway station in Murshidabad district on the night of February 17.Hossain and the others are admitted in hospital.The NIA team which reached Murshidabad on Wednesday afternoon visited the blast site and spoke to the local police. The officers also collected samples from the station. On Tuesday, the Union home ministry ordered the NIA to probe the blast.Hossain was supposed to board the Kolkata-bound Teesta Torsa Express from platform no 2 when the bomb, which was kept in a bag that was lying on the platform, went off.This is the second blast that the NIA is investigating in Bengal. The agency probed the 2018 bomb blast in a rented house at Khagragarh in East Burdwan district. Two operatives of the banned Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB), who were making bombs inside the house, were killed. The probe exposed a big terror network in India and led to more than 30 arrests including that of Kausar who founded the third unit of the JMB in India.The Criminal Investigation Department (CID) of the state police is already probing the Nimtita blast. The CID has so far arrested two suspects, Abu Samad and Saidul Islam, who are now police custody.A CID officer, who did not want to be identified, claimed that during interrogation Saidul, who is an expert in making crude bombs, has admitted that he kept the bomb at Nimtita station to settle an old score with the minister.Speaking on condition of anonymity, another state police officer associated with the probe told HT on February 21 that examination of the remains of the exploded bomb clearly indicated that it was a socket bomb of high quality.“We have doubts if common criminals in Murshidabad have the expertise. Some of us suspect the involvement of JMB as its operatives are experts in making bombs of this kind,” the officer had said.The NIA team that visited Nimtita did not speak to the media. However, a local police officer who interacted with the team said the NIA has not ruled out the possibility of the JMB’s involvement.A section of state police officers suspect that JMB operatives might have brought the bomb to the station to carry out a big terror attack, possibly an explosion in a packed passenger train.Chief minister Mamata Banerjee entrusted three state agencies, including the CID, with the investigation while the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Congress demanded probe by Central agencies.Murshidabad, where Muslims comprise 66.28% of the population, the state’s highest, shares border with Bangladesh.On February 10, a special NIA court in Kolkata handed a 29-year jail sentence to Kausar for his role in the Khagragarh blast. Kausar, 31, who was arrested by the NIA from a guest house in Bengaluru in August 2018, is also an accused in the 2018 Bodhgaya blast.The NIA and the Special Task Force (STF) of the state police have nabbed several JMB militants from Murshidabad district in recent years. The NIA has also nabbed several Al Qaeda suspects from the district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nia-starts-probe-in-bengal-railway-station-blast-that-injured-minister-101614787284334.html

I was a youth at that time,” said Kumar. He made the assertion while talking to mediapersons in the state legislature premises and said that whatever Congress leader Rahul Gandhi had said about the Emergency were his personal views.In an interview, Rahul Gandhi had said that the Emergency was a mistake during the regime of Indira Gandhi as Prime Minister. He admitted that the Congress at no point attempted to capture India's institutional framework.The Bihar CM said that Emergency was imposed when Jayaprakash Narayan was carrying out a massive agitation and a lot of people were arrested. “Fundamental rights of the people were usurped. People of the country gave their verdict by voting Congress out of power during the elections after the Emergency. All opposition parties got united after being influenced by Jayaprakash Narayan’s ideology and formed the Janata Party, which formed the government,” Kumar recalled.The Bihar CM, however, refused to make any comments regarding the income tax department’s raid on film stars, saying that the department was acting as per the rule and power vested in it under the law. To another query relating to raids on jails, the CM said keeping a close watch on activities within the prison was an unavoidable necessity. “I take note of every important thing that comes to light during the raids on jails,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rahul-gandhi-s-take-on-emergency-is-his-personal-opinion-says-cm-nitish-kumar-101614786522053.html

The government claims that these are part of the long-pending reforms in the agriculture sector. The farmers, however, complain that it will put them at the mercy of corporates.Talks with the government broke down on January 22. During a tractor rally on January 26, a section of the farmers broke off from the rally route and engaged in violent clashes with the police.Tikait's mantra for farmers included 1 village, 1 tractor, 15 men and 10 days, adding another 15 are to replace the first 15 on rotational basis."If these farm laws are enforced then the foodgrains will be locked in godowns of the traders and big companies and the price of foodgrains will be decided on the basis of hunger,” he said.He said that the farmer movement has not ended. "There are 15,000 tractors at Tikri border and farmers have put up huts under trees,” he said.The government has maintaiend that the offer for talks is still open. The farmers, however, are insistent on repeal of the farm laws and also a guarantee on minium support prices or MSP for their produce.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/if-tractors-are-stopped-remove-barricades-farmer-leader-rakesh-tikait-101614785018563.html

Police found his cell phone and motorcycle from the roadside around 10.30 pm on Tuesday.His body with bullet wounds was found from an agriculture field on Wednesday morning at around 5 am. Police said he was shot thrice.As the news of Hussain’s murder spread in the area, family members and local residents reached the spot and disrupted vehicular traffic. They stopped the police from sending the body for autopsy. Senior officials then reached the spot with reinforcement and launched a baton charge to disperse the mob.A police patrol car was torched while four vehicles were completely damaged by the mob. The state highway was blocked for some hours as the villagers clashed with the police who struggled to contain the situation. Additional forces were called from surrounding stations.Police said many miscreants were detained.“A case will be lodged and those responsible for the violence will be punished,” said Saran's superintendent of police (SP) Santosh Kumar.However, community leaders said the violence was a result of police negligence and insensitivity in tackling the matter and a reaction to deteriorating law and order situation in the area. A senior member of the community who did not wish to be named said that they suspected a political rivalry as the reason behind in the murder.Police eventually sent the body for post mortem around 2.30 pm.Earlier on Sunday night, criminals gunned down one Akash Kumar at Mohammadpur in Saran district. The victim was said to be grandson of mukhia Siya Devi. No one has yet been arrested in the case.On Wednesday, there was another protest against the police in southern district of Nawada after a 13-year-old boy was allegedly murdered in Warisliganj.Following the incident, family members and locals blocked Sheikhpura-Nawada road near Jaiprakash Chowk.

Pre-clinical trials conducted on animals and clinical trials conducted on humans are both integral parts of this process.Bhargava also reiterated what he said at a webinar organized by the Kerala government in February, about the interim results of Covaxin’s ongoing clinical trial showing effective results against variants of Covid-19. He added that the recent results which have been evaluated by a data safety and monitoring board has found Covaxin to be well tolerated across an expansive range of age groups. The phase 3 clinical trial enrolled 25,800 participants, including 2,433 individuals over the age of 60 and 4,500 individuals with comorbidities.“The results, evaluated by an independent data safety and monitoring board, show that the vaccine (COVAXIN) is well-tolerated and efficacious against SARS-CoV-2 across a wide range of age groups and variants in the country,” Bhargava said at Wednesday’s press conference.Bharat Biotech developed the country’s first indigenous vaccine, Covaxin, in partnership with ICMR.

This remark was followed by a barb at the government with the minister saying if such arrangements were made at borders, there won’t be any infiltration.“...But they run away when they see China. If this kind of preparation was made at borders with China or Bangladesh, infiltration won't happen,” he told the assembly.Thackeray’s comment drew a sharp response from former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis who condemned the statement and termed it an insult to the Indian soldiers. “The chief minister said -- 'China se hum bhagte hain'. It is an insult to our soldiers. Our soldiers faced the Chinese at -30°C temperature, laid down their lives and chased away the Chinese,” Fadnavis, who is leader of opposition, said in the assembly.The chief minister also slammed the BJP over it raising slogans. “(Shiv) Sena was not a part of the freedom struggle but neither was your parent organisation (RSS). Just chanting 'Bharat Mata Ki Jai' doesn't make you (BJP) a patriot,” Thackeray asserted.The claim, however, was rejected by Fadnavis, who said, “It seems the chief minister does not know that RSS founder Hedgewar was also a freedom fighter.”Earlier in the day, Thackeray also took on the Centre over the renaming of Motera cricket stadium in Ahmedabad after Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Replying to the Governor's address, he said, “"Someone said now we won't be losing any cricket matches because the name of the stadium has been changed. We won't be losing any match in that stadium... You erase the name of Vallabh bhai (Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel), do not award Bharat Ratna to Savarkar (Veer Savarkar) and try to teach Hindutva to us."(With ANI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nails-put-in-farmers-path-if-this-preparation-was-at-borders-maharashtra-cm-uddhav-thackeray-101614780274750.html

The three-day conference will begin on Thursday, with the PM delivering his address on March 6, said a second official.The JCOs and jawans have been invited to take part in the conference on the back of their gallant actions along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) where India and China are locked in a border standoff and both sides are currently in the midst of a disengagement process as well as their role in thwarting infiltration attempts along the Line of Control (LoC) in Jammu and Kashmir.After the National Democratic Alliance came to power in 2014, and then again in 2019, the PM has taken the initiative to reach out to jawans on several occasions including his practice of celebrating Diwali with soldiers. The PM has also repeatedly highlighted their role in safeguarding the country’s territorial integrity and sovereignty in his public speeches.PM Modi meeting and interacting with the JCOs and jawans during the Combined Commanders’ Conference is a major departure from tradition, and it will definitely send a positive message to all ranks of the armed forces, said Lieutenant General Vinod Bhatia (retd), a former director general of military operations.“Indian soldiers cost the minimum and deliver the maximum. Recognition by the PM will surely be a morale booster. It is an apt recognition of their sacrifices and professionalism, especially in view of the effective management of the LAC and LoC,” Bhatia added.The conference was traditionally held in Delhi but has been organised outside the national capital during the last five years. In the past, it has been held on India’s solitary aircraft carrier INS Vikramaditya, Indian Military Academy, Dehradun and Jodhpur, among other places.The conference is being held at a time when Indian and China are negotiating disengagement in eastern Ladakh and the military is putting finishing touches to its theaterisation plan for the most advantageous utilisation of its resources to address growing security threats.Also, it comes on the back of Indian and Pakistani militaries last week announcing that they had begun observing a ceasefire along the LoC from the midnight of February 24.The military is expected to make a presentation to the PM on the situation along the borders and progress made towards the creation of theatre commands, said the second official.India is set to begin a formal roll-out of its long-awaited theaterisation plan, with the Air Defence Command and the Maritime Theatre Command set to be launched by May, as previously reported by HT.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jawans-to-take-part-in-top-military-meet-for-first-time-pm-modi-to-address-it-101614777527913.html

He also sought AG’s consent to initiate criminal contempt proceedings against Katju.Also Read | Nirav Modi's extradition to India cleared: What next“I have submitted a letter to Ld. Attorney General for India seeking consent to initiate criminal contempt proceedings against Justice (Retd.) Markandey Katju for his extremely contemptuous remarks made in the Nirav Modi Extradition case,” Srivastava, an Advocate-on-Record with the apex court, tweeted on Wednesday.I have submitted a letter to Ld. Attorney General for India seeking consent to initiate criminal contempt proceedings against Justice (Retd.) Markandey Katju for his extremely contemptuous remarks made in Nirav Modi Extradition Case. pic.twitter.com/G3TpNOPQheIn the letter, dated March 1, 2021, Srivastava noted that the request was being made under Section 15 of the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, read with Rule 3 (c) of the Rules to regulate proceedings for Contempt of the Supreme Court of India, 1975. He then recalled observations made by the UK judge on Katju’s testimony in connection with the case.On February 25, while clearing Modi’s extradition to India over the multi-crore Punjab National Bank (PNB) scam case, the District Judge at Westminster Magistrates’ Court, Sam Gooze, observed that Katju’s testimony ‘was not reliable’ and had ‘hallmarks of an outspoken critic with his own personal agenda.’ Katju deposed as a witness for Modi in September 2020, arguing that the fugitive jeweller ‘would not receive a fair trial in India’ and that he was a ‘scapegoat being blamed for a financial crisis in India.’Also Read | UK Court terms Markandey Katju’s testimony in Nirav Modi trial unreliableSrivastava further wrote in his letter that the UK court’s judgement categorically noted that the day before the ‘contemptuous’ remark, Justice Katju also gave an ‘elaborate’ press commentary about it to the media. This, as per Srivastava, amounts to Katju ‘deliberately and willfully scandalising’ the Supreme Court and lowering its authority, not just in front of the UK court, but also in front of the public at large.He added that these statements can ‘undermine the dignity and authority’ of the Supreme Court, and also recalled an instance from 2016 when the court issued a Contempt Notice against the former judge for a ‘contemptuous’ Facebook post. Srivastava added that in this case too, there was a criminal contempt of the Supreme Court, also citing the example of the recent Prashant Bhushan case, and finally sought Venugopal’s nod to initiate criminal contempt proceedings against Justice Katju.Nirav Modi’s case will next be taken to British home secretary Preeti Patel. If Patel also gives her nod, Modi will be extradited to India and lodged at Mumbai’s Arthur Road jail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nirav-modi-case-lawyer-says-ex-sc-judge-katju-made-contemptuous-remarks-101614776676482.html

Earlier, responding to the question, Environment and Forest Minister Mama Natung said that as per Survey of India toposheet, two villages are located outside the notified wildlife sanctuary.Quoting an order from the Centre, Natung said that the process of dereservation of reserve forests cannot be taken up without approval of the Supreme Court.

03-03-2021||India||To improve green cover, Telangana MP helms initiative to promote planting trees||Presenting a bouquet or a garland to a politician or a celeb on birthdays or at public events has become out of fashion these days in Telangana. Instead, celebrities prefer accepting a tree sapling.On Wednesday, when Telangana home minister Mohammad Mahmud Ali celebrated his birthday, he appealed to the people not to come to him with bouquets, but plant trees. The minister himself planted a sapling at Anjuman Khadim-ul-Muslimeen, an orphanage in Amberpet in Hyderabad.And the credit for encouraging politicians and other VIPs to take up tree plantation goes to 44-year-old Joginapalli Santosh Kumar, a Rajya Sabha member from Telangana Rashtra Samithi, who had taken up a unique initiative – Green India Challenge (GIC) – three years ago, to improve the state’s green cover.“Happy to plant a sapling on my birthday as part of #GreenIndiaChallenge initiated by @MPsantoshtrs Saab. Request everyone to take part in this noble initiative. #GIC,” the deputy chief minister tweeted.Unlike other politicians who keep themselves busy indulging in power politics, Santosh, as the MP prefers being called, is focussing on promoting tree plantation among people in a big way.“My objective is to see that there is greenery everywhere – whether it is a small house, or a street or a colony or a township. At a time when even the villages are turning into concrete jungles, there is every need to develop greenery in whatever little space we have, in order to make a better living,” says Santosh.The idea of the Green India Challenge came to Santosh in July 2018, when people were being carried away by fancy challenges on social media like “Ice Bucket Challenge” and “Rice Bucket Challenge.” He said instead of wasting time on such publicity programmes, he thought he would do something that was useful to society.“After discussing with my friends, I came up with this idea of challenging the people to plant tree saplings, which would go a long way in improving the green cover in the state. The inspiration for me was my uncle, chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao, who took up this tree plantation programme in a big way in Siddipet when he was an MLA in ‘90s,” he said.The Green India Challenge – with “Hara Hai Toh Bhara Hai” slogan, tags people to plant a sapling, challenging three others to do the same to continue the chain. “Within no time, the challenge has got tremendous response. Politicians, officials, sportspersons, celebrities from film industries in Telugu, Tamil, Malayalam, Kannada and Bollywood, also took up the challenge and planted trees in their respective areas and posted the pictures on their respective social media platforms, which led to the campaign going viral,” Santosh said.The GIC has now emerged as one of the largest campaigns initiated by an individual, as more than 13 crore trees have been planted in different parts of the country.Taking the campaign to the next level, Santosh has been requesting corporate groups to take up the afforestation on a larger scale in as many as 88 forest blocks in and around Hyderabad.“In an attempt to encourage industrialists, I adopted 2,400 acres of reserve forest area at Keesara in Medchal-Malkajgiri district, two years ago and took up planting of 30,000 trees. The entire area has been fenced and now, there is a tremendous growth in the forest area,” he said.Inspired by him, chairman of Hetero Pharma B Parthasarathy Reddy adopted 2,543 acres of forest land at Narasapur to improve the green cover. “Popular actor Prabhas (of Bahubali fame) has also responded to adopt 1,650 acres of forest land at Kazipally. Another big industrial group has agreed to spend nearly ₹70 crore to take up tree plantation at Rachakonda forest area on the outskirts of the city,” he said.In an attempt to highlight the importance of afforestation, Santosh brought out a coffee-table book titled “Vriksha Vedam” which comprises slokas and literary renditions from various ancient scriptures like Vedas, Ramayana, Mahabharata, Sanskrit literary works and Buddhist literature that preached the importance of trees for the welfare of mankind.Santosh is planning to set up a Green India Foundation to take up the tree plantation programme extensively to all parts of the country. “I am planning to invite Prime Minister Narendra Modi to be part of this campaign. His message will go a long way to inspire many generations to come,” he said.On the occasion of KCR’s birthday on February 17, Santosh gave a call for “Koti Vriksharchana” (worshipping trees with planting of one crore saplings). “It was a huge success. An unprecedented number of 1, 05, 25,625 tree saplings were planted in less than an hour on a single day,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/to-improve-green-cover-telangana-mp-helms-initiative-to-promote-planting-trees-101614775628491.html

For His Holiness the Dalai Lama, we will make special provisions."Earlier, Kangra Chief Medical Officer Gurdarshan Gupta said the request by the CTA for vaccination of the Dalai Lama and the people living around him was sent to the government."Permission has come now and modalities are being worked out to vaccinate them. Since His Holiness is in self-quarantine, a request was made to vaccinate him at his own premises, and that is under consideration," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/request-to-vaccinate-dalai-lama-at-his-premises-is-under-consideration-kangra-authorities-101614774627616.html

The ED was cooking up stories without even understanding the KIIFB. Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman was using central agencies to target the state,” said state finance minister Thomas Issac.Last week, addressing an election rally in Ernakulam, the union minister had questioned the role of KIIFB and its budgetary provisions.Issac dismissed the ED charge that ‘masala bonds’ violated FEMA, saying there were set guidelines for external borrowing and KIIFB received the permission of the Reserve Bank of India.Masala bonds are specialised debt instruments issued outside the country in Indian denomination rather than local currency. In 2019, chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan had attended the listing event at the London Stock Exchange.“The ED’s move is a violation of poll code. The union minister also violated the poll code and it will be resisted with the support of the people,” he said. He also alleged that an ED official, who is the son of a senior BJP leader, was entrusted with the case to go after the state during election time.BJP state president K Surendran lauded the ED’s move.“The state’s debt had risen manifold in the last five years. In the name of KIIFB Issac and others were literally looting the state. Let there be some accountability,” he said. In the last report the Comptroller and Auditor General had also recommended a probe against the KIIFB constitution and its funding mechanism. The ED is also likely to question Issac.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-minister-says-notices-to-investment-fund-board-cheap-poll-gimmick-101614773956948.html
03-03-2021||India||‘Won’t lose match as stadium’s name is Narendra Modi’: Thackeray’s dig at Centre||Taking a swipe at the Centre over changing Motera stadium’s name to Narendra Modi stadium in Ahmedabad, Maharashtra chief minister Udhav Thackeray on Wednesday said that his party doesn't need to learn Hindutva from Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led central government."Someone said now we won't be losing any cricket matches because the name of the stadium has been changed. We won't be losing any match in that stadium... You erase name of Vallabh bhai (Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel), do not award Bharat Ratna to Savarkar (Veer Savarkar) and try to teach Hindutva to us," Thackeray said replying to a discussion on the Governor's address in the state assembly.Maharashtra chief minister’s remarks come days after the world’s largest cricketing arena in Ahmedabad was renamed after Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the presence of President Ram Nath Kovind, Union home minister Amit Shah and Union minister of state for sports Kiren Rijiju.At the inauguration of the stadium, which can accommodate 130,000 spectators, last month, Shah had said, “Ahmedabad will then be known as the sports city of India.” The sports minister on the other hand had said, “It is a proud moment for India and not just cricket. While it is the largest cricket ground, it’s also one of the most modern stadiums in the world.”Amid criticism by the opposition over renaming the stadium, Gujarat deputy chief Minister Nitin Patel earlier issued a clarification saying Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel's name was never associated with the stadium."This stadium is owned by the Gujarat Cricket Association (GCA) and it was always known as the Motera Stadium. So there is no question of renaming it now. It was Narendra Modi, who had first floated the idea to demolish the old stadium and build a new one when he was the GCA president," Patel said, adding that the Narendra Modi Stadium is part of a larger complex, named 'Sardar Patel Sports Complex'.Targeting the Congress over the issue, Union minister Prakash Javdekar had tweeted, “The name of the Sports Complex is Sardar Patel Sports Enclave.

The chief minister had then termed it a historic occasion for the state. RJD was the lone party that had voted against the Bill in Parliament.“The upper caste cell has been formed for the first time. Earlier, most political parties formed cells as per reservation granted in the Constitution. With the upper caste poor also getting 10% quota, JD-U president RCP Singh formed one for them also,” said party’s upper caste cell president Dr Nitish Kumar ‘Vimal’ alias Nitish Kumar ‘Tantan’, who has been with the JD-U since its inception and was also part of the Samata party since 1994.He said the objective behind the ‘novel initiative’, which would also inspire other political parties, is to establish communication with people, try to know their issues and anger, if any, and ensure that the advantages of the government’s inclusive development approach reach them.“We will expand the cell up to the village, panchayat and block levels. A couple of days later, a large number of upper caste friends drawn from different fields will also join us at a formal function in front of the party president. The idea is to make JD-U more and more inclusive with space for all. Most of the government programmes are also inclusive in nature,” he added.He also cited the statement of a senior IPS officer Arvind Pandey, who called for the need of a separate ministry for the welfare of the poor among the upper castes. “Like other social groups, which have separate departments to look after their needs, the upper caste should also have one,” Pandey had said citing his personal views.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-bid-to-expand-base-after-poll-debacle-jd-u-forms-upper-caste-cell-101614772563844.html

She also warned that consumption of donkey meat violates the Food Safety and Standard Authority of India (FSSAI) norms.“People should know that under FSSAI, donkey consumption is illegal,” said Dr Dhanalakshmi.The district of Prakasam continues to practise their ancient ritual of donkey slaughter. Dr Dhanalakshmi told ANI that “maximum complaints of illegal slaughtering of donkeys have been received from districts of Prakasam, Krishna, West Godavari, and Guntur,”.Illegal slaughter of this domesticated animal has been a constant issue in Andhra Pradesh - the state even released orders in the past against slaughter and consumption of donkeys.The illegal slaughter of donkeys for consumption is a violation of Section 11 in the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960, which amongst other provisions deems it illegal to “beat, kick, over-ride, over-drives, over-load, torture or otherwise treats any animal so as to subject it to unnecessary pain or suffering or causes or, being the owner permits, any animals to be so treated,”. It is also a punishable offence under Section 429 of Indian Penal Code (IPC), which states, “Mischief by killing or maiming cattle, etc., of any value or any animal of the value of fifty rupees. Whoever commits mis­chief by killing, poisoning, maiming or rendering useless, any elephant, camel, horse, mule, buffalo, bull, cow or ox, whatever may be the value thereof, or any other animal of the value of fifty rupees or upwards, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to five years, or with fine, or with both,”(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/official-worried-about-decline-in-donkey-population-in-andhra-pradesh-blames-misconception-101614772774343.html

The property is under the name of his wife Asha and located in Delhi's Palam area, the ED said.The shelter home was being run by NGO Seva Sankalp Evam Vikash Samiti, managed by Thakur.The ED accused Thakur of "misappropritating" funds received as grants from the government and other agencies in the name of the NGO. Grants-in-aid to the tune of ₹7.57 crore was siphoned off by Thakur and invested the same in his own name as well as in the name of his family members, the agency further said.The ED said that Thakur also spent money on his younger son Mehul Anand’s medical education."During money laundering investigation, it was revealed that the girls' shelter home in Muzaffarpur was found to be running in a highly questionable manner and several girls reported about violence and being abused sexually," the ED said, adding that Thakur raped the girls.The case pertains to sexual exploitation of 44 girls at the shelter home.

03-03-2021||India||Uttarakhand budget session: Chamoli cloud burst dominates Day 3||The recent Chamoli cloud burst accident dominated the third day of the Uttarakhand Budget Session on Wednesday with the Leader of the Opposition Indira Hridayesh raising the issue of disaster management, demanding a comprehensive policy for disaster management, including an early warning system for disaster. First, Congress MLAs staged a sit-in at the entrance of the House in Gharsain, holding placards against the government on Monday’s lathi-charge incident on which it had staged a walkout and sit-in protest on Tuesday as well. Villagers of the Ghat area have been agitating for the last two months in support of their demand for the widening of Nandprayag-Ghat motor road. The protest took an ugly turn when the agitators walked up to the Assembly, only to be stopped by the police which resorted to lathi-charge. Water cannons were also used to prevent agitators from reaching the Vidhan Sabha building. While the Congress has been raising the issue in the House for two days now, its MLAs also questioned the government on the Chamoli cloud burst and also the steps being taken to ensure such a disaster is handled better if it recurs. Congress MLAs raised the issue by moving an adjournment motion on the same as soon as the House commenced on Wednesday. It was, however, taken up for debate by the Speaker in Zero Hour. Hridayesh said, “Being a disaster-prone state, many lives have been lost in natural disasters such as floods, landslide, flash floods, and earthquake. Recently, the state faced the Chamoli disaster in which many people died after being trapped in the tunnel. Before that, the country was shaken by the 2013 Kedarnath tragedy. Considering all these, the government should consult experts and frame a comprehensive disaster management policy including an early warning system on the disaster so that lives aren’t lost.” She also cited the strategic importance of the border areas of the state. “The government should take efficient steps for disaster management in the border areas so as to prevent migration of residents from there as it is important from a strategic and security point of view to make the residents stay there.” Another Congress MLA from Ranikhet, Karan Mahra, questioned the government on resources required for handling such disasters. “In the Chamoli disaster, it was learnt that many people died in the tunnel after about five days due to lack of oxygen inside. If there was proper equipment to supply oxygen there, those lives could have been saved. The government should scan such equipment being used in other countries and procure them for better disaster management,” said Mahra. Congress MLA from Dharchula, Harish Dhami, cited flash floods and landslide in his constituency last year in which 21 people died and accused the government of “not doing enough for the disaster victims including rehabilitation and providing compensation”. “The disaster wreaked havoc in the area but the government seems not to be taking it seriously. But it is beyond understanding that the government is doing the rehabilitation of the affected families on the basis of the 2011 census for a disaster that happened in 2020,” said Dhami. Replying to the Opposition, parliamentary affairs minister Madan Kaushik spoke about the various steps being taken on disaster management, including “forming a committee comprising scientists on February 22 in the aftermath of Chamoli disaster to provide suggestions to handle disasters in a better way”. “The government is working on an early warning system for disasters, but it would take some time as it is not an easy process and needs several analyses,” he said. “The government will install a second Doppler radar in the state, and weather warning equipment in 176 places. As many as 839 families from 395 disaster prone villages have been rehabilitated since 2013 Kedarnath tragedy,” he said.While Kaushik was still speaking, Congress MLAs Dhami and Rajkumar staged a walkout citing the government reply as “unsatisfactory.” The House also tabled two amendment bills related to providing land ownership rights to women and other related to the Panchayati Raj system in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-budget-session-chamoli-cloud-burst-dominates-day-3-101614771452531.html
03-03-2021||India||EAM Jaishankar to travel to Bangladesh tomorrow to prepare for PM Modi’s visit||External affairs minister S Jaishankar will visit Bangladesh on Thursday to prepare the grounds for Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s trip to the neighbouring country later this month. Jaishankar, who is visiting at the invitation of his Bangladeshi counterpart AK Abdul Momen, will call on Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina during the day-long trip, the external affairs ministry said on Wednesday. He will also hold talks with Momen. The visit follows on the virtual summit between the two countries on December 17 and will “provide an opportunity to take stock of the progress in bilateral relations”, the ministry said. Modi is set to visit Bangladesh to participate in celebrations on March 26 marking 50 years of the country’s independence and the establishment of diplomatic relations. This will be his first foreign visit since the Covid-19 outbreak. Modi was earlier scheduled to visit Dhaka in March last year, but the trip was called off because of the pandemic. Also Read | Jaishankar, New Zealand counterpart discuss peace and stability in Indo-PacificJaishankar’s talks with Momen are expected to review bilateral ties and focus on regional and international developments, including the situation in Myanmar following the February 1 coup and its impact on efforts to repatriate Rohingya refugees to Rakhine state, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity. India has worked to remove irritants in ties with Bangladesh over the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and sped up work on several connectivity and transit projects. Foreign secretary Harsh Shringla made his first foreign visit amid the pandemic to Dhaka in August last year and handed over a personal message from Modi to Hasina. During the virtual summit with Hasina on December 17, Modi described Bangladesh as an important pillar of India’s “Neighbourhood First” policy. The two sides signed seven agreements at the summit in areas ranging from hydrocarbons to agriculture and revived a cross-border railway line that was snapped 55 years ago, giving a boost to connectivity initiatives and energy cooperation. Bangladesh foreign secretary Masud Bin Momen visited India in January for foreign office consultations and India has provided two million doses of the Covishield vaccine to Bangladesh under the “Vaccine Maitri” initiative.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/eam-jaishankar-to-travel-to-bangladesh-tomorrow-to-prepare-for-pm-modi-s-visit-101614771032546.html

03-03-2021||India||BJP’s Hindutva push not in line with Tamil Nadu ally AIADMK||The Bharatiya Janata Party’s predicament in Tamil Nadu is best summed up by Tejasvi Surya, a Lok Sabha member from Karnataka who said on February 22 that the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) “represents a bad, virulent ideology which is anti-Hindu”.“Every Tamil is a proud Hindu. This is the sacred land that has the highest number of temples... Every inch of Tamil Nadu is sacred, but DMK is anti-Hindu, so we must defeat it,” he said at a rally in Salem.The problem, of course, is that the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, the senior partner of the alliance of which the BJP is a part, has the same beliefs and ideologies as the DMK. Both are Dravidian parties that trace their provenance to a common parent, Periyar (E V Ramaswami), and his emphasis on rationalism and anti-Brahminism.Over the weekend, home minister Amit Shah took on the DMK and the Congress at a rally on the issue of corruption. “The Congress and the DMK together carried out a scam of ₹12 lakh crore when they were in alliance at the Centre,” he said. Only, this is unlikely to cut much ice in Tamil Nadu — and not the least because Shah and the BJP are trying to convince their ally the AIADMK to take VK Sasikala, just back from serving four years in jail in a disproportionate assets case, into the fold.These are just some of the contradictions the party has to manage in a state where it is a minor political player, and where it is seen as a Hindu and Hindi party. To be sure, the party, otherwise a vocal proponent of the Hindi language, has been extolling the virtues of Tamil in an effort to connect with Tamilians.And both national and local leaders are hoping that what worked for the party elsewhere — Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the emphasis on development — will work in the state.Addressing a rally in Coimbatore last week, Modi’s speech combined the BJP’s ideological standpoint with issues of governance that the party perceives has a wider resonance on the ground in the poll-bound state.The state will pick a new assembly on April 6.Senior party leaders said the BJP will take advantage of PM Modi’s governance model to woo voters in the state, including those who are either opposed to the BJP or are ambivalent towards it. “There is a section of people that sees the BJP as a Hindu party that seeks the imposition of Hindi. There is also a section that is impressed by the BJP’s governance model in other states and at the centre. The party has to win the confidence of both these sections,” said a BJP leader who asked not to be named.“The Vel Yatra was a sideshow. The discourse in Tamil Nadu has to be congruent to what the AIADMK, the senior partner in the coalition wants. The BJP’s stance should not dislodge the campaign,” the leader explained.The BJP is also hoping the dynastic nature of the DMK (MK Stalin’s son is expected to contest the elections, even as this is the former’s first real electoral test after the death of his father M Karunanidhi), and its partner, the Congress, will be an issue with voters.In a recent meeting, Shah said: “We can see 2G, 3G, 4G all in Tamil Nadu. 2G- 2 generations of Maran family; 3G -3 generations of Karunanidhi’s family; 4G- 4 generations of Gandhi family.”Political commentator Sumant C Raman concurred that since the BJP is the junior partner in the alliance, it will have to adhere to a campaign narrative that suits both partners.“...Also, in Tamil Nadu the hardline Hindutva stance will not help. The BJP has been smart, in keeping with the Dravidian ethos; instead of Lord Ram they have focused on Lord Muruga, which is why there was the Vel Yatra...,” he added.The party is also carefully crafting its image as that of a political outfit that is not in not in conflict with the prevalent sentiment of pride in the Tamil language and customs.A second BJP leader said the PM’s repeated reference to Tamil poet Thiruvalluvar over the years is an attempt to forge a connection with Tamilians.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjps-hindutva-push-not-in-line-with-tamil-nadu-ally-aiadmk-101614767608746.html

The TS Transco has taken various measures like blocking server IPs communicated by CERT-In and temporarily disabling control function for remote operation of circuit breakers from SLDC, they said. User credentials for all those accessing TSSLDC website were changed and suspected equipment within the perimeter of the SCADA (process control system) control centre were isolated to ensure safety of the grid and satisfactory power supply to all consumers of the state, they said.The increased state of alertness would continue for some days, the official said, adding, "not only Telangana, for that matter, every state has to be careful."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/telangana-thwarts-china-based-hacker-s-bid-to-target-power-set-101614768403098.html

03-03-2021||India||‘Biggest gift’: Residents along LoC in J&K welcome India-Pakistan ceasefire||Thousands of people living along the Line of Control in north Kashmir’s small hamlets are relieved after the director general of military operations (DGMO) of India and Pakistan decided on a ceasefire along the LoC in Jammu and Kashmir.On Thursday, India and Pakistan agreed to observe a strict ceasefire along the LoC from February 24 midnight. A joint statement issued by the armies of both countries said the move followed a discussion between India’s director general of military operations (DGMO) Lt Gen Paramjit Singh Sangha and his Pakistani counterpart Maj Gen Nauman Zakaria over their established telephone hotline. For the last several months, there has been a surge in ceasefire violations along the LoC both in Jammu and in Kashmir regions."This is not the first time a ceasefire was announced on the LoC. For us it’s always good because we know what ceasefire means to us. We can live peacefully in our villages along with our children," said Irshad Ahmad Khawja who lives at village Garkote on the LoC.He said that from the last several months, the residents living along the LoC had only one demand, construction of underground bunkers. "The bunkers were our only safety shield during the cross LoC shelling and many people even started building bunkers on their own. And if the ceasefire was implemented again we won’t need the bunkers."He claimed in the last two years, dozens of houses were destroyed in Uri and six people were killed in the cross LoC shelling alone in the villages."In our neighbouring village Balkote, a young woman was killed in November when shells hit her house leaving her four children orphaned," said Khawja.Another resident, Ajaz Ahmad Shah of village Silikote on the zero line, said for them, the ceasefire means new lease of life. "Dozens of families migrated from our villages as they wanted to escape from the daily shelling. We now hope people will return." Shah said he lost his cousin when a shell landed on her house in a neighbouring village last year in November. "Whenever there is shelling, we always start thinking it is going to be the end of our lives. We have been living a miserable life and now, we want peace to prevail."Since 2003, when India and Pakistan agreed on the ceasefire along the LoC, which remained successful till 2017, the people living in the bordering areas reaped the dividends. "During the ceasefire years, the villagers even used to harvest right up to the LoC. We used to have peaceful sleep all those years," said Bilal Ahmad of Izmerg village near LoC in Gurez in northern Bandipora district. Gurez witnessed a lot of cross LoC shelling last year. "We are hopeful that this ceasefire will be successful like the previous one, announced in 2003."Mohammad Sayed Peerzada, a resident of Tangdhar in border Kupwara district said that since the last two years, there has been an increase in the intensity of shelling in the region..." The shelling had become a routine, especially in the villages close to LoC. In Kupwara district, half a dozen civilians were killed and houses damaged. We are happy the ceasefire between India and Pakistan will restore peace and people can live peacefully," he said, adding that in the last three decades, people living close to LoC have lived very tough lives. "Now we want to live peacefully and it will be only possible when India and Pakistan abide by truce." He said the earlier truce on the LoC and the borders saw reopening of many routes between India and Pakistan... "Hope this ceasefire will be followed by reopening of routes between the two parts of Kashmir and other peace initiatives."Also Read: 'Not sedition to have views different from govt': SC junks plea against AbdullahThere are some, however, who were not much hopeful of the ceasefire lasting long. "Our experience tells us that these initiatives don’t last long," said Aftab Ahmad from Kupwara. "If it is successful this time, it will be the biggest gift to the border residents of the two countries."Last month, the ministry of defence, while replying to a question in parliament, said that Pakistan resorted to 5133 incidents of ceasefire violations in 2020 and there were 46 casualties last year due to these violations.Recently, outgoing 15 Corps commander, Lt General B S Raju told media persons that efforts will be made to make this ceasefire successful and termed the year 2020 as the most peaceful year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/biggest-gift-residents-along-loc-in-j-k-welcome-india-pakistan-ceasefire-101614766851251.html

03-03-2021||India||‘Another Vyapam’: Agriculture officers recruitment exam candidates allege fixing||Ten top rankers in Madhya Pradesh’s examination to recruit officers for the agriculture department, committed the same mistakes and scored similar marks in the general knowledge paper of the entrance examination, conducted by the Madhya Pradesh Professional Examination Board, (MPPEB) on February 10 and 11. Several candidates have raised suspicion that it could be another Vyapam scam in the Central Indian state.The coincidence did not end here. According to information provided by MPPEB, their caste, their college and academic performance is also almost the same, raising question marks over the recruitment examination.The examination was held for 862 posts in the agriculture department and the answer sheets were released on February 17 with the list of probable selected candidates. It was then a suspicion was raised over the conduct of the examinations.The candidates alleged it was another recruitment exam scam in the state ---infamous for rigging of entrance to medical colleges in 2013-14, popularly known as Vyapam scam. They also asked how these candidates from one region and caste with poor academic backgrounds could score the highest marks in the recruitment exam, which doesn’t have any provision of an interview.A candidate from Indore, Ranjeet Ragunath, said, “This is the tip of the iceberg of a scam. All top ten highest scorers in the exam are from Chambal division and nine are from the same caste. They completed their Bachelor of Science (Agriculture) degrees from a government agriculture college in Gwalior. Almost all the candidates completed their four-year degrees in five or more years.”“Even, they told some of the ex-students of their college that they were going to be selected 100% and they said this before the exam, so they were sure. Either, they had the question papers, or they might have some arrangement like the candidates had during the Vyapam scam,” he alleged.“They also secured 195 and 194 marks out of 200 that are the highest scores in the history of the exam,” claimed Raghunath.“The candidates scored full marks in the general knowledge section. But our suspicion increased when the MPPEB released answer sheets on February 17 and gave wrong answers to three questions. Coincidently, the top scorers also gave the same wrong answers in their answer sheets. We don’t know whether it is a coincidence or conspiracy, but how it is possible that they gave the same wrong answers, especially of basic questions which we studied in class 11,” said another candidate Sachit Anand from Satna.One of the top scorers in the exam, who scored full marks in the maths section, had failed in the statistics exam several times and completed his degree in eight years, he added.A professor at the agriculture college Gwalior was also surprised over the marks of these candidates. Requesting anonymity, the professor said, “Maybe overnight they earned knowledge and scored qualification marks but it is hard to believe that they scored the highest marks.”The candidates also raised questions on MPPEB for selecting a blacklisted company to conduct the exam.“This is also unfortunate that MPPEB allowed a blacklisted company to conduct the exam. It is the same company that was blacklisted by UP after a question paper of recruitment exam for sub-inspectors got leaked in 2017. The incidents of leak of question papers were also reported in other exams including teachers’ recruitment test in Tamil Nadu and protection officers’ recruitment test in Railways,” said Rajesh Singh from Gwalior, a candidate.When contacted, state head of NSEIT, MP, Krishnan Dwivedi said, “We adopted a fair method while conducting the exam. The candidates have the right to raise their voices but only MPPEB is authorized to clear the doubts of candidates. We can’t comment on this issue.”Also Read: MP govt to seek right to take criminal action against controversial web seriesThe candidates also met farmers’ welfare and agriculture development minister Kamal Patel who assured of holding an inquiry in the matter.Patel said, “This could be a coincidence, but we will inquire into the matter.”MPPEB director Shanmuga Priya Mishra said, “They are levelling allegations because of a lot of coincidences. We are inquiring into the matter and have also asked the company. Till now, we didn’t find any adverse things or irregularities. But if we find something concrete, we will act accordingly.”The candidates in question couldn’t be contacted over the phone despite repeated attempts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/another-vyapam-agriculture-officers-recruitment-exam-candidates-allege-fixing-101614761365920.html

In a given case, it may also be defamatory, depending on the type of use," the court said in its order.The order copy was made available on Wednesday."The fact that the image has been illicitly used is bad enough. It only makes matters worse when used in a plainly derogatory and demeaning vein," Justice Patel said.The court directed OTT platform Amazon to take down the movie within 24 hours until the said scene is deleted."It is not acceptable for them (movie's makers) to merely pixelate or blur the images. The entire sequence, which has the image of the plaintiff (Malik), is to be removed immediately," Justice Patel said.Malik's advocate Bedi had argued that the actor has a huge fan following on social media and has also appeared in a few Bollywood songs.Bedi argued that Malik's photo was used illicitly by the defendant in a Telugu movie titled 'V' that was released on Amazon on September 5, 2020.As per Malik's suit, she had commissioned a photographer in 2017 for creating a portfolio."In August 2017, she (Malik) posted some photographs from the portfolio on her Instagram account. One of these photos was used in a scene of the Telugu movie where there is reference to a commercial sex worker," Bedi said.According to the suit, this was an unauthorised invasion of privacy and unauthorised use of private material.It was defamatory to Malik that her image was used to depict her in the motion picture as an escort or commercial sex worker, it stated.Justice Patel in the order noted that the contentions raised by Malik and her lawyer were correct."Indeed, I do not believe there is any other way of looking at it," the order said.The defendant claimed that they had contracted with an agency to procure the image and had assumed that prior approval would have been taken from the woman, whose photo was to be used.The court, however, noted that this argument of the defendant seemed "less than compelling"."Surely any right-thinking motion picture producer would have insisted on seeing an approval or consent by the model or person who is featured or to be featured," Justice Patel said, adding that this must be the standard procedure everywhere.The court said once the defendant has made the necessary alteration and deletion, the same will have to be shown to Malik and her advocate."Only after this, I will allow defendant 3 (Amazon) to re-release the movie," Justice Patel said, posting the matter for further hearing on March 8.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bombay-hc-asks-amazon-to-take-down-film-over-actor-s-defamation-case-101614760879060.html

Even in such serious cases, the insensitive and negligence of government is unfortunate," the former Uttar Pradesh chief minister said in a tweet in Hindi.She also targeted the BJP government at the Centre over the issue of Dalit rights."Dalit oppression and murder of a man in Hathras and ruthless killing of a Dalit RTI activist in Gujarat prove that lives of Dalits, oppressed and women are not safe under the BJP government like in previous Congress regime.

Searches, which began on Wednesday morning, are being conducted at the offices of these agencies and residences of the people associated. Commenting on the ongoing raids, Union minister Prakash Javadekar said the agencies only go after those against whom they have credible information. "The matter later goes to court," the minister said. Both Anurag and Taapsee are known to be vocal about their criticism of the government.Anurag Kashyap, Vikramaditya Motwane, producer Madhu Mantena, and Vikas Bahl came together to found film production company, Phantom Films, in Mumbai in 2011. In March 2015, Reliance Entertainment procured 50 per cent stake in the company.After a series of movies comprising both hits and misses, the company was dissolved in 2018 facing a sexual assault allegation on Vikas Bahl, brought by a former employee of Phantom.In its seven years of operation, Phantom Films worked with several top Bollywood actors, directors, co-producers. Taapsee Pannu worked with Phantom Films in 2018's Manmarziyaan. Earlier this year, it was reported that Madhu Mantena bought the shares of Anurag Kashyap, VikramadityaMotwane and Vikas Bahl in a bid to revive the company. Each of the three held 12.5 per cent shares in the company.

03-03-2021||India||Demand for gasoline, diesel in India will reach record 215.24 mln in 1 yr: PPAC||India, once the centre of global oil demand growth, expects its fuel consumption to bounce back during the coming year as the nation recoups the losses caused by Covid-19.Demand for gasoline, diesel and other fuels will reach a record 215.24 million tons in the 12 months through March 2022, according to estimates by the Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell of India’s oil ministry. That’s almost a 10% rebound from the current year, which has been hit hard by the virus.At one stage last year, India’s fuel consumption plunged by as much as 70%, led by the world’s biggest lockdown. The measures forced a sharp reduction in crude processing and imports, and helped drive a slump in international oil prices. On Thursday, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and allied nations will discuss how much crude to pump, and India is urging them to open the taps.Also watch: Fuel price hike: Petrol, diesel prices rise again after a pause of two daysThe world’s No. 3 oil importer and consumer expects strong demand for transport and industrial fuels to drive next year’s rebound. Consumption of diesel -- an economic barometer and the country’s most-used fuel -- will grow by more than 13%, as will demand for gasoline. Overall fuel demand in the current financial year, which runs to March 31, is expected to fall 8.5%.India’s economy pulled itself out of recession last quarter, helped by a boost in government spending and the reopening of an economy that’s mainly driven by domestic consumption. It was one of the few major economies to post growth in the final three months of 2020.A trend for more commuters to use personal cars -- instead of buses, trains and other modes of public transport -- is expected to drive India’s demand for gasoline.Demand for aviation fuel, which suffered the biggest blow, is estimated to grow more than 74% during 2021-22, but will remain a little lower than the pre-pandemic year, the PPAC’s projection showed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/demand-for-gasoline-diesel-in-india-will-reach-record-215-24-mln-in-1-yr-ppac-101614732427588.html
03-03-2021||India||'Not sedition to have views different from govt': SC junks plea against Farooq Abdullah||The Supreme Court on Wednesday rejected a plea seeking action against former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Farooq Abdullah for his comments on scrapping of Article 370 and said that it was not seditious to have views different from the government.The judgement was pronounced by a bench of Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and Hemant Gupta. "The expression of a view that is different form that of the government cannot be termed seditious," the bench observed, dismissing the petition. It also directed the petitioners to deposit ₹50,000 for filing the petition.The petitioners, Rajat Sharma and Neh Srivastava, had taken exception to the National Conference (NC) chief's comments on the Central government's 2019 decision to scrap Article 370 which conferred special status on the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir. The petition also demanded that the leader's membership of Parliament be declared null and void and sedition charges be slapped on him under Section 124-A of IPC.During a television interview in 2020, Abdullah had said he wished that with China’s support, Article 370 of the Constitution, will be restored.He noted that China was not happy with the nullification of Article 370 and said, “As far as China is concerned, I didn’t bring {the} Chinese president here. Our Prime Minister invited him to Gujarat and even did jhoola sawari with him. He [PM Modi] even took him to Chennai and had food with him.” The National Conference, however, denied that he made any such comments. “Our leader never said that Article 370 will be restored with the help of China, which was claimed by BJP leader Shambit Patra at a press conference. He also presented some earlier statements of Mr Farooq Abdullah in a wrong manner,” Hindustan Times' Hindi language publication Hindustan had quoted an NC spokesperson as saying.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/not-sedition-to-have-views-different-from-govt-sc-junks-plea-against-farooq-abdullah-101614753675500.html
03-03-2021||India||BJP claims encroachment of Hindu site in Guntur. Andhra cops 'fact-check' them||Andhra Pradesh BJP leaders on Tuesday targeted chief minister Jagan Mohan Reddy’s government alleging encroachment of a famous Hindu religious site at Edlapadu in Guntur district. The administration has, however, rejected the charge, pointing that the Christian religious site was not at the same place as a temple but more than a kilometre away.The controversy started with a series of tweets posted by Bharatiya Janata Party leaders alleging a Christian Cross was being built on a hillock close to a Hindu religious place at Edlapadu in Narasaraopet block in Guntur district. BJP state general secretary S Vishnuvardhan Reddy was among the first to post a message with some photographs on his Twitter handle, claiming that the “Christian conversion mafia” was encroaching upon the place where goddess Sita’s footprints and carving of Lord Narasimha existed.“No place for Hindus in AP under @ysjagan govt. Attacks on Hindu temples continue,” he tweeted.Soon, Reddy’s tweet was retweeted by BJP state president Somu Veerraju, who claimed illegal construction was happening at the Hindu religious place.“All this is happening with the support of the administration and @ysjagan government. @BJP4Andhra and @RSSorg protested against illegal construction in the past but the administration is in no mood to stand for Hindus,” he tweeted.Later, BJP national secretary and co-in-charge of Andhra Pradesh affairs, Sunil Deodhar also raised the issue. “See huge illegal Cross in Edlapadu, AP, where once footprints of #SitaMata existed. Carving of Lord Narasimha exists at the back. In Guntur district, Christian mafias have created havoc. @BJP4Andhra and @friendsofrss protested but the administration tacitly supported. #Encroachment4ChristinAP.”The tweets went viral among BJP and other Sangh groups, evoking loud protests at a time when YSR Congress party is busy campaigning for elections to municipalities and municipal corporations in the state.A YSR Congress party leader from Guntur, who refused to be quoted, said the controversy over Edlapadu hills was totally unwarranted and the BJP, which has little stake in the municipal elections, was only trying to gain some political mileage.The Guntur (Rural) police issued a clarification through Twitter on Wednesday. “Fact check: THEY ARE COMPLETELY 2 DIFFERENT HILLOCKS and there is absolutely NO encroachment of the hill where Narasimha Swami idol is there ..(check videos by our SHO) Request to use Twitter to spread love, unity and peace,” the tweeted.Fact check : THEY ARE COMPLETELY 2 DIFFERENT HILLOCKS and there is absolutely NO encroachment of the hill where Narasimha Swami idol is there ..(check videos by our SHO)Request to use Twitter to spread love, unity and peace..@APPOLICE100 @dgpapofficial @ysjagan pic.twitter.com/lc7HZpq6c5Also Read: 4 killed in car crash in AP's Anantapur, liquor bottle found near driverNarasaraopet sub-collector Srivas Nupur said there was absolutely no truth in the claim about the encroachment of the hillock hosting the Hindu religious sites. He said there was an old Mother Mary temple at an adjacent hill at Yerragonda hillock in the same village and local RCM Church authorities sought district administration’s permission to construct steps for the devotees to reach the temple.“However, even before the government gave any permission, the church authorities started constructing steps and erecting a huge cross. On coming to know about it, the police and revenue authorities went there and stopped the works. Appropriate action would be taken on the directions of the government,” Nupur said.He clarified that both the hillocks hosting religious sites of the Hindu and the Christians were located at a distance of one and a half kilometre. “So, I request people not to believe in rumours but maintain restraint,” the sub-collector said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-claims-encroachment-of-hindu-site-in-andrha-govt-advices-against-rumours-101614753318359.html

03-03-2021||India||Odisha: Opposition says OBC survey bid to create vote bank by Naveen Patnaik||Odisha is all set to start a survey of social and educational conditions of state's OBC community from May 1 this year, becoming the first state to undertake such an exercise even as opposition parties questioned the motive, asking if the Naveen Patnaik government was planning to create an OBC votebank.The Odisha State Commission for Backward Classes formed last year, recently announced that a database on the present conditions of people belonging to the OBC community will be prepared. “Survey will be conducted on the social and educational conditions of the people belonging to backward classes. Their occupation, education standard and other parameters will be covered under the survey,” said justice Raghunath Biswal, head of the commission. The survey is likely to exclude those OBC persons whose socio-economic standards have gone up over the years.The survey process will begin in the first week of May and conclude in June. The first draft list of the OBC community will be released on June 1 and objections will be invited till June 5. The commission is expected to come up with the final list by June 11, said officials.The decision to hold the survey came exactly a year after the Union ministry of home affairs rejected a proposal of the state cabinet for census of socially and educationally backward classes and other backward classes/castes during the 2021 general census. Soon after the Centre's rejection, Patnaik tabled the Odisha State Backward Classes (Amendment) Bill in the state assembly enabling the Backward Class Commission survey of the social and economic conditions."The State doesn’t have access to any recent data on this as the last census was done in 1931 which is almost 90-year old. This data is not enough for accurate and focused planning to reach out to the backward classes of the society,” the chief minister said last year while tabling the bill."It's an attempt to create an OBC votebank and this would be the first attempt in Odisha to influence voting through caste lines. BJD would certainly get some benefit out of the exercise," said former minister Bijoy Mohapatra.Though, the other backward castes account for 54% of Odisha's population, caste has never been a factor in state's politics unlike Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan or Karnataka. Neither the OBCs, nor the tribal and Dalits, who form 24% and 17% of the state’s population respectively, have ever voted en bloc in the past.Political analysts said the decision to start an OBC survey may have been triggered by fears of opposition BJP trying to target them ahead of next year's panchayat polls. Senior BJP leader and union petroleum and natural gas minister Dharmendra Pradhan, himself an OBC, in a recent letter to chief minister Patnaik, had urged the state government to reserve seats for students belonging to the OBC category and the socially and economically backward classes.Though the BJD won 113 of the 147 assembly seats in 2019 assembly polls with 44.6% vote share, the BJP, was not far behind with 38% votes, though it could win only 23 seats, becoming the principal opposition party."Since last few elections, BJD has assiduously cultivated a woman votebank through programmes like ‘Mission Shakti’ that have created over 6 lakh self help groups. By beautifying religious places like Jagannath temple in Puri and Lingaraj temple in Bhubaneswar as well as several other famous temples across the state, it is trying to play a religious card before the BJP does it. By playing an OBC card it wants to upstage BJP in that segment," said Gyana Ranjan Swain, a political science professor.Many others feel Naveen Patnaik may be wary of consolidation of Paikas or Khandayats (a militia caste) behind the BJP as a result of the party’s efforts in the last few years through several events including the 200th anniversary of the famous Paika rebellion against the British and a memorial for the fallen Paikas on the foothills of a mountain near Bhubaneswar. Khandayats are the martial race of Odisha who are numerically superior with 22% share in population. Though they figure in the Odisha’s list of SEBCs, they are not in the Central list of OBCs and hence excluded from any reservation."The OBC survey seems to be a strategy to induct the Khandayats in the OBC list but exclude the creamy layer among them so as to prevent their future consolidation behind the BJP," said Biswaranjan Mohanty of Congress.Also Read: Odisha Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik inaugurates hostels for ST/SC studentsSajjan Sharma of BJP said the survey was just to hoodwink the OBCs in the state as the key to any survey was implementation. "The government is known for conducting such things, but it fails when it comes to execution." said Sharma.Former union minister Srikant Jena, himself a backward caste leader, said BJD’s real motive was suspect. “Naveen Patnaik government could have appealed before the Supreme Court after the Odisha high court in 2017 struck down the Odisha Reservation of Posts and Services (for Socially and Educationally Backward Classes) Act that provisioned for 27% reservations for the OBCs in government jobs. I wonder what kind of socio-economic survey would be completed within two months," he asked.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-opposition-says-obc-survey-bid-to-create-vote-bank-by-naveen-patnaik-101614749722304.html

How would states meet intergenerational equity? These proposals violate the principle of subsidiarity and the federal structure of our Constitution,” Goa Foundation director Claude Alvares, said.We urge state governments to urgently examine the consequences of these proposals on the federal structure of our Union, the constitutionality of these proposals, especially in light of their role as public trustees over the shared inheritance of mineral wealth on behalf of the people and future generations, he added further.The Goa Mining People’s Front, a collective of mine worker unions, has however said that owing to Goa’s peculiar case unless the state’s legacy issues are resolved all attempts to resolve Goa’s mining impasse were bound to fail.“A petition challenging the Union Government’s move to convert Goa’s mining concessions as granted by the Portuguese to mining leases is pending before the Supreme Court for the last two decades. Unless that matter is disposed of no progress can be made,” Puti Gaonkar the president of the GMPF, said.“If the matter is resolved one way or another then the state or Central governments are free to proceed with the grant of fresh leases either through auction or any other means available,” Gaonkar said. “If any decision is taken prematurely, the existing mine owners will further seek to stay the process that could leave Goa’s mining in litigation for another ten years and further delay the restart,” he added.Officials in the Goa Mineral Ore Exporters Association (GMOEA), a body of mine owners, said they have written to the Centre expressing reservations over the proposed amendments, especially the clause that empowers the Union government to auction mining leases since it will be prejudicial to their claims over the mining leases. A GMOEA spokesperson, however, remained tight-lipped on the communique.Besides the challenge to the abolition of concessions to leases, a bunch of Goa’s mine operators led by Vedanta are also before the Supreme Court claiming that their leases are eligible to be renewed up to 2037 -- a period of 50 years with effect from 1987 -- if the law as it currently stands is applied retrospectively. The matter is currently being heard by the Supreme Court.Also Read: Activist in Goa files anticipatory bail plea fearing arrest in 'toolkit' caseThe Goa mining industry at its peak contributed 16% to the State GDP but has now reduced to a mere 0.2% owing to its shutdown in the state since the Supreme Court cancelled Goa’s 88 active mining leases in February 2018. The SC ruled that the renewals were illegal and asked the state government to grant fresh leases in tune with the existing policy.However, with the state government being reluctant to auction the leases, which is now the de facto means to grant fresh leases since the 2015 amendments to the MMDR Act, the situation has remained deadlocked.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-ecologists-miners-oppose-centre-s-proposed-amendments-to-mining-act-101614746800131.html

03-03-2021||India||With 14,989 fresh Covid-19 infections, India's active cases surge past 1.7 lakh||A day after recording daily infections around 12,000, India on Wednesday registered a little spike in daily infection reporting 14,989 new cases in the last 24 hours. On Tuesday, the 24-hour infection tally was at 12,286. Recoveries reached 10,812044 with 13,123 recoveries reported in the past 24 hours. With an infection tally higher than the recovery, India's active caseload on Wednesday stood at 1,70,126.On Tuesday, India's active cases were around 1.68 lakh. Maharashtra, Kerala, Punjab, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat are contributing maximum to the number of daily cases, the Union health ministry said. Six states and UTs, including Maharashtra, Kerala, Goa, Chandigarh, Punjab and Gujarat, have a weekly positivity rate higher than the national average of 2 per cent. Maharashtra leads all the states with a weekly positivity rate of 10.02 per cent, the ministry said on Tuesday.Maharashtra reported 7,863 new coronavirus infections on Tuesday, taking the state's caseload to 21,69,330.Kerala on Tuesday reported 2,938 new Covid-19 cases and 16 deaths.Punjab on Tuesday reported 730 new Covid-19 cases, while Tamil Nadu and Gujarat added 462 and 454 new cases, respectively.The Centre has deputed high-level multi-disciplinary teams to several states witnessing this sudden spike in the number of daily infections to ascertain the reason behind the rise.The sudden spike in daily infections comes after the Covid-19 situation became stable in January. The rise is seen as a combined effect of restrictions being eased everywhere and people slipping into the comfort of complacency. Several states have imposed local restrictions to contain the spread of the infection. Vaccination is also gaining pace as the second phase of the drive is now open to senior citizens and those with co-morbidities between the age group of 45 to 59.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/with-14-989-fresh-covid-19-infections-india-s-active-cases-surge-past-1-7-lakh-101614744939822.html

In a statement titled "Amazon Prime Video Apologizes", the company on Tuesday said it deeply regrets viewers considered certain scenes to be objectionable."This was never our intention, and the scenes that were objected to were removed or edited when they were brought to our attention. We respect our viewers' diverse beliefs and apologize unconditionally to anyone who felt hurt by these scenes," it added.The political thriller web series has been ebroiled in controversies since its release in January on Amazon. The Saif Ali Khan-starrer deleted the controversial scenes, but it didn't save the series from political wrath. Three FIRs were registered in Uttar Pradesh's Lucknow, Noida, and Shahjahanpur, two FIRs were lodged in Madhya Pradesh while one FIR each was lodged in Karnataka and Bihar. Apart from the FIRs, at least three other criminal complaints are pending in Maharashtra, Delhi, and Chandigarh, respectively.In January, Aparna Purohit, 'Tandav' actor Mohammad Zeeshan Ayyub, and the makers had approached the Supreme court seeking protection from arrest on the FIRs. The top court at that time denied granting interim protection.The appellants then moved to the Allahabad high court which on February 25 declined to give them protection. "Such people make the revered figures of the religion of majority community source of earning money in a most brazen manner taking benefit of the liberal and tolerant tradition of the country," the court in its order said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tandav-row-supreme-court-to-hear-amazon-prime-head-s-anticipatory-bail-plea-101614743615563.html

This was probably the first such action against digital news anywhere in the country -- four days after a gazette notification on the new digital media rules were published.However, on Tuesday, I&B minister Prakash Javadekar told HT: “The rules are very clear that a DM does not have the power to issue such a notice. The mechanism is mostly self-regulatory and only in very serious cases can they complain to the ministry.”A letter written by I&B ministry secretary Amit Khare to Manipur chief secretary Rajesh Kumar said that the powers under the new rules “have not been delegated to the state governments/district magistrate/police commissioner”. It said the rules are to be administered by the ministry of information and broadcasting.The show is hosted on Facebook page of Kishorechandra Wangkhem, an Imphal-based journalist against whom the present Bharatiya Janata Party-led government in the state has slapped several cases since 2018 and who has been jailed three times.The notice issued by Naorem Praveen Singh, district magistrate of Imphal West district, said: “It has come to the notice of the undersigned that you are providing online services on news and current affairs on the social media platform.”The publisher/intermediary were directed to “furnish all relevant documents that you ensure compliance of the provisions” of the new rules “failing which steps as deemed fit shall be initiated without further notice”.On Tuesday evening, a letter addressed to the publisher/intermediary of Khanasi Neinasi was issued by the same DM, mentioning that the notice issued earlier “stands withdrawn with immediate effect”.The programme Khanasi Neinasi is around two months old and besides being broadcast, it was also telecast on the YouTube channel of Frontier Manipur, an Imphal-based digital news platform.“We have hosted just four to five shows. The last show aired on February 28 (a day before the notice was issued) was titled ‘Media Under Siege: Are Journalists Walking a Tightrope’” Kishorechandra, who’s also an associate editor of Frontier Manipur, said over the phone from Imphal.“It is not the responsibility of the district magistrate or the state government to issue such notifications. It seems they realised their mistake and decided to withdraw the earlier notice,” Kishorechandra added.Frontier Manipur has a collaboration with another news portal call Seven Salai and uses the latter’s infrastructure. Paojel Chaoba is the publisher as well as executive editor of Frontier Manipur.Kishorechandra was first arrested in November 2018 for uploading a video on social media which was critical of the government of Manipur chief minister N Biren Singh.Several charges under IPC that included sedition and National Security Act were slapped against him. He was released in April 2019 after the Manipur high court revoked his detention.He was again arrested in September 2020 on charges of sedition and promoting enmity between different groups on social media. Kishorechandra was released in December 2020 following which he joined Frontier Manipur and started hosting the talk show.In January this year, Chaoba and Dhiren Sadokpam, editor-in-chief of Frontier Manipur, were detained for over 24 hours based on an FIR filed by a police officer for publishing an opinion piece titled ‘Revolutionary Journey in a Mess’.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/manipur-sends-notice-to-journalist-citing-digital-media-rules-withdraws-it-after-centre-steps-in-101614742815763.html

The NIA also raided Kumar’s residence.Kumar was arrested after several hours of questioning on Monday.

In a statement in December, the NIA said the accused in the case were involved in cross-border smuggling of heroin in huge quantities from Pakistan and supplying it to Jammu & Kashmir and other parts of the country. “They were also in regular communication with the operatives of proscribed terrorist organisations Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and Hizb-ul-Mujahideen (HM), using encrypted chat platforms.

The ministry released a state-wise list of all these hospitals.Long wait times, glitches in Co-WIN slow vaccine driveAs vaccination gathered pace on March 2, the second day of 2nd phase vaccination, the Centre said if private hospitals have an adequate number of vaccinators, adequate space for observation of the vaccinated, adequate cold chain management and adequate arrangement for the management of any adverse effect, then states/UTs can proactively make efforts to use these private hospitals as vaccination centres.Private hospitals have also been asked to open vaccination slots for 15 days to a month so that people can book their appointment in advance. In the first two days, private hospitals were allowing advanced booking for only a day or two.The Centre has also asked states to not store vaccines or to create a buffer stock, apprehending any future shortage. It also asked the government to supply vaccines to hospitals for the entire duration for which sessions have been planned. "States/UTs should not store, reserve, conserve or create a buffer stock of the Covid vaccines at the state and district levels. The Central Government has adequate stock and will provide the required vaccine doses to the States and UTs," the health ministry said at a high-level review meeting on Tuesday with additional chief secretaries, principal secretaries and secretaries of states and UTs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/more-private-hospitals-to-becomecovid-19-vaccine-sites-centre-allows-states-to-decide-101614741077452.html

"I think that was a mistake. Absolutely, that was a mistake. And my grandmother said as much. But the Congress party did not want to capture India's institutions. We do not have that capability," Rahul Gandhi said."What RSS is doing today is something different. They are capturing all constitutional institutions. So even if we defeat the BJP, we are not going to get rid of the RSS people in the institutions," Gandhi said citing the present situation in Pondicherry. He also mentioned how the Congress government in Madhya Pradesh could not work because of the RSS force in all institutions.LIVE: My interaction with Prof Kaushik Basu @Cornell University https://t.co/GfErZtSpW2On being asked about internal democracy in the party, Rahul Gandhi said to Basu, "You are asking this to a person who has been pushing for elections in the party, in youth organisations for a decade. I was literally crucified for this. I have been attacked by my party people."Can you do push-up with 1 hand, Rahul Gandhi asks TN students. Then a demo"Nobody asks whether there is internal democracy in BJP, BSP (Bahujan Samaj Party) or Samajwadi Party (SP). There is a reason. We are an ideological formation. So it is more important for us to be democratic. It doesn't matter whether others are," Rahul added.Talking about Rajiv Gandhi's assassination, Rahul Gandhi said it was more painful for him as a son to see Rajiv Gandhi walking towards his death, knowing that he won't come out of what he was fighting than the actual death."It made me understand violence. It made me understand the other. So I remember it's a strange thing, I saw my father's killer lying on a Sri Lankan beach. And I felt bad for him. I was really upset for him. He is somebody else's father. So when someone talks about violence, I sort of sit quietly and say you don't actually understand violence. That's why you are so enamoured by you.""When Prabhakaran (LTTE leader) died, I picked up my phone and called my sister and said Priyanka this is strange that I am feeling bad. I should be happy about this. I am feeling disturbed that why are they humiliating the man like this. And Priyanka said she was feeling the same," Gandhi said.Talking about the RSS model, Rahul Gandhi said a former RSS person met him and explained to him the entire model."He said the innovation of Narendra Modi is to take large capital and fund RSS which used to be an organisation of small shopkeepers. So now the model is to scale up RSS using 2,3,5,7 crony capitalists. The Gujarat model is actually giving thousand of crores to RSS modules," Rahul said."He told me that the model was first tried on Pramod Mahajan. But it failed. It was done well by Narendra Modi in Gujarat. Crony capitalists have found out that to capture the political system, the route is through RSS," Rahul Gandhi said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/emergency-was-a-mistake-says-rahul-gandhi-talks-about-father-prabhakaran-101614735905813.html

03-03-2021||India||Climate crisis to cost $100 billion to Indian firms in next 5 years: Report||Top Indian companies estimate an economic impact of about ₹7.14 lakh crore (nearly US$100 billion) over the next five years from the risks posed by the climate crisis, according to a report by CDP (formerly Carbon Disclosure Project), an organisation that works on a global disclosure system for investors, companies, cities, states and regions.The report, titled “Building Back Greener”, said the numbers were based on responses by 42 of 220 Indian companies that responded to investor requests and disclosed climate data. Of the 220 companies that were covered by CDP, 60 are among BSE’s top 200.The report also highlighted that growing disclosure requirements were prompting more Indian businesses to wake up to the threat of the climate crisis, and commit to reducing their carbon footprints.Around 88% of 67 large companies covered by CDP reported incentivising top management for climate-related actions; 99% of the responding sample have board-level oversight of climate-related issues, the report said. Out of the 220 companies covered by CDP’s disclosure project 67 are large businesses and the rest are micro, small and medium enterprises.Meanwhile, the number of companies that identified the financial or strategic impact of climate-related risks rose from 88% in 2019 to 94% this year, as compared to the previous report released last year. Among the principal areas of concern were direct operations (the most severely affected and the exposed most to physical risks), followed by emerging regulations, and market risks.“Forty-two of 67 responding companies have monetised the economic impact of climate risks. The rest didn’t monetise the risks but did mention the risks they were facing. Most companies said they faced economic impacts from current and emerging regulations... They also fear emerging regulations like emission caps or emission trading schemes,” said Damandeep Singh, Director CDP India.He added that there were other risks such the impact of the climate crisis where valuation of their companies may fall; the future of the oil and gas sector; and impact on their reputations for being seen as not doing enough.The report said that four Indian companies — Hindustan Zinc, IndusInd Bank, Mahindra & Mahindra and Tech Mahindra -- have made it to the CDP. A list for the first time in recognition of their bold climate action.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/climate-crisis-to-cost-100bn-to-indian-firms-in-next-5-years-report-101614732253720.html
03-03-2021||India||Delhi Assembly session next week: Govt may table state budget on March 9||The Delhi assembly’s budget session will be held from March 8 till March 16, the Delhi government announced on Tuesday after the state Cabinet finalised the dates.HT has learnt that the economic survey and outcome budget 2020-21 is likely be tabled on March 8, while the 2021-22 state budget — the seventh by the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) in its three terms in power — will be tabled on March 9.The Delhi Assembly last held a session on December 17 and 18, a special meet to debate the three contentious farm laws and an alleged ₹2,400 crore scam in the city’s civic bodies.The Delhi government proposed a ₹65,000 crore budget outlay for 2020-21, the highest till date and around 8.33% higher than the previous financial year’s expenditure. The total outlay in the AAP government’s first budget, presented in 2015-16, was ₹41,500 crore.This will be the first after the Covid-19 pandemic, with the infection and consequent lockdown severely denting the state government’s revenue.For 2020-21, Delhi had pegged budgeted revenue receipts (excluding borrowings) at ₹55,309 crore. Revised estimates for the year will be mentioned in the upcoming budget (2021-22) and actual revenue receipts for the year will reflect in the budget after that. Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia, who also holds the finance portfolio, said last month that the government’s revenues dropped by around 42% because of the pandemic.The 2020-21 budget was tabled in the Assembly on March 23, even as Delhi planned a week-long lockdown, and the nation-wide lockdown had not been announced till then.The Delhi Budget this year (2021-22) is likely to focus on health, basic infrastructure and transport, said senior officials who are drafting the document.The senior officials said this year’s health budget will see allocations related to Covid-management and vaccination. In the last budget, the government made a special allocation of ₹50 crore to provide for adequate quarantine facilities to fight the infection.The other major investment, according to officials, is likely to be the cloud-based health information management system (HIMS) – a project the government plans to roll out in August this year.The HIMS project envisages digital health cards for patients, which will be essentially a QR code-based system that will keep a record of clinical details such as health checks, follow-ups, surgeries, medications and vaccinations for each patient. The system is also supposed to include a mobile phone application as well as a 24x7 call centre to help patients with health-related information, fix consultations and other assistance.The upcoming budget is also likely to see allocations to upgrade hospitals and increase bed capacities in state government facilities, said officials.“The Delhi government should invest in creating a strong and vibrant public health system, beyond hospitals. A strong public health system will help the Capital not only handle epidemics like Covid-19 but to address all sorts of health crises,” said Dr Lalit Kant, former head of the epidemiology and communicable diseases department in the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).In its past budgets, the AAP government has consistently allocated the maximum share of its resources for education, followed by health. This year, health care and medical infrastructure are likely to see increased allotments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assembly-session-next-week-govt-may-table-state-budget-on-march-9-101614730159415.html

I think it is not able to take the load. Most people prefer coming to the hospital directly for registration, which leads to overcrowding,” said a staff member at a private Delhi hospital, requesting not to be identified.The hospital in question vaccinated close to 250 people on Tuesday but had to turn away several for lack of time. “We came here around 3pm but were told that due to the rush, our turn won’t come before 5pm. Now when we have returned at 5pm, they closed the doors,” said Anita Kapur, 65, who had come from Noida to get the shot at Max Hospital in Saket.“I am not denying that people are facing difficulty in registering but it has been just a day since the facility was opened for general population so there will be logistical issues even regarding medicines, but it will all get streamlined in a few days,” said RS Sharma, chairman, empowered group on Covid Vaccination, during Union health ministry’s briefing on Tuesday.“Scalability is of a concern to us. But from the supply-side hospitals will have to publish their time table and sessions, which means it is like a train time table wherein hospitals are like trains and citizens are making reservations. That is how the system is supposed to work, and state governments are coordinating with the hospitals; and supply of vaccines to them is happening through the state governments. We are encouraging them to provide vaccines to them and involve more private hospitals,” he said.On Tuesday, there were close to 600,000 doses given, taking the total number of shots administered since January 16 (when the drive began) to 15.5 million.Admitting that there were glitches, Sharma said, “…Unfortunately glitches are something which has become associated with IT systems in India. Initially, there were glitches in the first version of the programme, which were rectified.”Close to 27,000 hospitals are currently providing Covid-19 vaccination across the country, including 12,500 hospitals in the private sector empaneled under Ayushman Bharat, Central Government Health Scheme and State health insurance scheme.Sharma and Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan chaired a high-level review meeting with states, directing them to involve for Covid-19 vaccination even those private hospitals that are not empanelled under any government scheme to open more options for people if required.States were also asked to utilise 100% capacities of private hospitals functioning as COVID Vaccination Centres (CVCs).The Centre also asked states to ensure adequate quantity of vaccines was maintained in all hospitals both government and private during the entire duration, to enable them to function as CVCs in a smooth manner.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/long-wait-times-glitches-in-co-win-slow-vaccine-drive-101614729949567.html

Chattel means slave or a tangible piece of property.“What do you think? Is a woman a chattel that we can pass such an order? Is a wife a chattel that she can be directed to go with you?” asked an SC bench of justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and Hemant Gupta while hearing the man’s petition.At the core of the dispute is an April 2019 order on restitution of conjugal rights, passed in favour of the man under Section 9 of the Hindu Marriage Act (HMA) passed by a family court at Gorakhpur. The woman maintained that she was tortured by her husband over dowry after their marriage in 2013, compelling her to move out. In 2015, after she filed a case seeking maintenance, a Gorakhpur court asked the husband to pay her ₹20,000 a month. The husband filed his plea for restoration of conjugal rights in the family court after this.Once the Gorakhpur family court issued its restitution order, the man went to court, questioning the payment of maintenance when he is willing to live with her. He raised a point of law on his obligation to keep paying maintenance even after obtaining an order restoring his conjugal rights. The Allahabad high court refused this, following which he appealed in the Supreme Court.In her defence, the woman, through her lawyer Anupam Mishra, said the husband’s entire “game” was to avoid paying maintenance and pointed out that he approached the family court only after being ordered to do so. In the course of Tuesday’s hearing, the man’s lawyer said the top court should persuade the woman to go back to her husband, especially since the family court has ruled in the man’s favour. Mishra, representing the wife, countered thiat an appeal on that order is pending before the Allahabad high court.The persistent demand by the man to enforce the return of his wife prompted the bench to say: “Is a woman a chattel? Is a wife a chattel? You are asking us to pass an order for this as if she can be sent to a place where she does not want to go, like a chattel.” The bench declined the husband’s request for enforcement of conjugal rights, reminding him that his appeal before the top court was arising from dismissal of his petition by the Allahabad high court against the order to pay maintenance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/wife-not-husband-s-chattel-can-t-be-forced-to-live-with-him-top-court-101614729536178.html
03-03-2021||India||SC tells states to install CCTVs in police stations, probe agencies in 5 months||The Centre and states were in the firing line on Tuesday before the Supreme Court for not complying with a three-month old order to install CCTVs in all interrogation rooms of central investigating agencies such as the Central Bureau of Investigation, National Investigation Agency and police stations across the country.The Court accused the Centre of “dragging its feet” and directed Solicitor General Tushar Mehta to file a reply in three weeks indicating clear timelines for installation of closed-circuit televisions (CCTVs) in the offices of CBI, NIA, Enforcement Directorate, Narcotics Control Bureau, Directorate of Revenue Intelligence, Serious Fraud Investigation Office and any other agency having power of arrest and interrogation. The next hearing in the case will be on April 6.Court-appointed amicus curiae senior advocate Siddhartha Dave prepared a chart indicating unsatisfactory response from states as well with some proposing to achieve compliance of Court’s December 2, 2020 order by end of 2023.“These are matters of utmost moment concerning the citizenry of the country,” the bench of Justices RF Nariman and BR Gavai said, asking most of the states to complete the process of budgetary allocation and installation of CCTVs by August this year. Relaxations were made for poll-bound states of West Bengal, Assam, Kerala and Tamil Nadu and the largest state of Uttar Pradesh to achieve this task by the year-end.Bihar got the longest time of one-year to achieve compliance after the Court expressed serious displeasure on the state’s affidavit that neither disclosed a timeline or details of budget allocation. “It shows complete lack of any regard to the citizenry’s fundamental rights or orders of this Court,” the bench remarked. Two other states of Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan got a slight leeway by getting an additional one-month to the five-month rule owing to its large size. The MP government, which shelved the budget allocation for CCTV project to 2023, was pulled up by the Court for dragging its feet. The bench did not appreciate Jharkhand’s decision to get the task done by 2024. Terming the deadline “unrealistic”, the bench told the state not to “play around” with the Court’s order.The December 2 order required states and Centre to install high-definition CCTVs with night vision, audio recording and storage facility of a minimum period of 12 months to 18 months. In areas which faced power outages and issues of internet connectivity, the Court directed the respective state governments to provide the same expeditiously.About CCTVs in police stations, the Court directed installation of one CCTV each at all entry and exit points, main gate of the police station, all lock-ups, all corridors, lobby/ reception area, all outhouses, Inspector's room, Sub-Inspector's room, areas outside the lock-up room, station hall, in front of the police station compound, outside (not inside) washrooms/toilets, Duty Officer’s room, and back area of the police station.The states required to complete the installation of CCTVs in five months are Haryana, Telangana, Karnataka, Himachal Pradesh, Gujarat, Tripura, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Goa, Arunachal Pradesh, Sikkim, Nagaland and Odisha. The union territories of Jammu and Kashmir, Chandigarh, Dadra and Nagar Haveli, Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Lakshadweep, and Daman and Diu were also directed to comply with the same timeline.Delhi sought nine months to make existing CCTVs equipped with audio recording and storage facility but the top court gave the National Capital Territory government four months to comply fully with its judgment.Punjab submitted to the Court that CCTVs were already installed in all police stations in 2018 but the same were not in accordance with the requirements set out by the December 2 order. Andhra too reported partial compliance. As an exception, Punjab and Andhra Pradesh got seven months to complete the installation work.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-tells-states-to-install-cctvs-in-police-stations-probe-agencies-in-5-months-101614711997938.html
03-03-2021||India||SC backs taxpayers in software royalty case||esolving a two-decade-old taxation conundrum, the Supreme Court on Tuesday ruled that payments made by an Indian resident to a foreign recipient for the import of software that is to be sold in India will not be assessable as “royalty”. A top court bench, headed by justice Rohinton F Nariman, held that such payments for the use of software “will not give rise to any income taxable in India” and therefore, no liability would accrue for the resident firms to deduct TDS under Section 195 of the Income Tax Act.The bench, which also included justices Hemant Gupta and BR Gavai, clarified that the ruling will apply across the board; when a computer software is purchased directly by an end-user resident in India from a foreign supplier or manufacturer; when resident Indian companies act as distributors or resellers for other residents; when a foreign distributor resells to Indian users; and when software is sold affixed to a device by a foreign supplier to Indian residents.The judgment, which involved approximately ₹500 crore in tax revenue, will impact companies such as IBM India Ltd, Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, Hewlett Packard India, Mphasis Ltd, Sonata Software Ltd, and GE India, among others.The judgment will also impact over 100 companies that import software for sale in India, since the payments made by them will now constitute as “business income” in the hands of the recipient, and in the absence of a permanent establishment of such a recipient in India, no tax is required to be withheld at source.The dispute began after a Karnataka high court judgment in 2011 decided in favour of the tax department, holding that payments to non-resident firms for purchase of software should be treated as royalty, and obligating resident companies to deduct TDS at the time of credit or payment, whichever is earlier. However, some other high courts and the income tax tribunal took a divergent view, calling upon the Supreme Court to examine the question of law and settle it.Before the top court, the tax department contended that the sale of copyrighted software would constitute grant of an interest in their copyright under the Copyright Act, thus necessitating the deduction of tax at source under Section 195 of the Income Tax Act.The companies, on the other hand, emphasised that these transactions were in the nature of sale, and no part of copyright was transacted since the non-resident continued to have proprietary rights in the software.Accepting the companies’ submissions, the bench held that the amount paid by them to the foreign software suppliers did not amount to royalty, as a result of which, no liability to deduct TDS arose. It underlined that these sales did not attract the rigours of the Copyright Act because no right to reproduce had been given to the resident firms, and hence such payments could not come under the ambit of “royalty”.Experts said the verdict settled an important legal dispute.Smita Goel, partner at business legal services firm Algo Legal, said: “The Supreme Court has resolved a 20-year-old controversy with this verdict. Now, non-resident seller companies not having a business presence or permanent establishment in India, would be outside the ambit of taxation since payment received for the sale of computer software will be treated as business income.”Amit Maheshwari, tax partner, AKM Global, said: “This is a very important judgement and would have far-reaching implications. The SC has also gone behind the object of the Copyright Act.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-backs-taxpayers-in-software-royalty-case-101614708858870.html
03-03-2021||India||5 days after 12-year-old girl disappeared in UP’s Bulandshahr, body found in pit||Police in western Uttar Pradesh’s Bulandshahr district on Tuesday found the body of a 12-year-old girl buried in a shallow grave in the home of a villager five days after she went missing. The villager’s son who is the prime suspect is absconding.Police said the body was found in the afternoon in a village of Anoopshahar area and suspect that it could be a case of murder after sexual assault.Police have launched a hunt for the house-owner’s son named Harendra (22). The house owner has been taken into custody.Police said the girl had gone to collect cattle fodder with her mother and elder sister on the outskirts of the village on February 25. After some time, she went towards a house nearby in search of water to drink, but did not return, they said.Her mother and sister searched for her for some time and, thinking that she might have gone home, they also returned home. After not finding her at home, they searched at their relatives’ houses and the village and finally lodged a complaint at Anoopshahar police station on February 28 against Harendra.Senior superintendent of police (SSP), Bulandshahr, Santosh Kumar Singh said police visited Harendra’s house on Monday but it was locked. The house is at a distance from the village. Harendra is a labourer and works in Delhi. Police quizzed his father, also a labourer, who told them that Harendra had come to the village three days back but he did not know where he was.“Police then searched the house and spotted recently dug wet soil in a corner inside the boundary of the house. When they dug the soil, they found the body of the missing girl,” Singh said.The SSP said prima facie it seems to be a case of rape and murder. The girl’s family had no enmity with anyone in the village.“The body has been sent for post-mortem examination and police teams have been formed to arrest Harendra,” the SSP said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/5-days-after-12-year-old-girl-disappeared-in-up-s-bulandshahr-body-found-in-pit-101614709660275.html
03-03-2021||India||Barely 22 days after taking first jab of vaccine, medico dies of Covid-19||A final year MBBS medico, who took the first jab of the Covid-19 vaccine around 22 days back, died late on Monday evening at his hometown Begusarai after testing positive for coronavirus, amid indications of more students testing positive for the virus at the medical college.Shubhendu Shubham, 23, a 2016-batch student of Patna’s Nalanda Medical College Hospital (NMCH), had taken the first shot of Covaxin in the first week of February, but tested positive for the viral infection later last month before he could take the second shot, said his batchmate Anand Bhushan.Experts say that one develops immunity against the virus 14 days after the second shot of the vaccine which is taken after a minimum of 28 days of the first shot.“Shubham tested positive for Covid-19 at NMCH on February 24 and immediately left for his hometown Begusarai,” said Bhushan.He was initially put on oxygen support there and later admitted to a private health facility near the GD College, where his condition deteriorated very quickly and he died on the second day of hospitalisation around 10.30 pm on Monday, he added.“The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-Reactive Protein (CRP) value and D-Dimer level were high. The computerised tomography (CT) scan of chest indicated that the lungs were functioning at 50-75% efficiency. The severity value of CT scan was bordering towards severe. He bled through nose and mouth towards the end stage, all of which are indications of coronavirus,” said Ravish Kumar Singh, an MBBS intern at NMCH, who was among five friends to visit the bereaved family at Dahiya village in Begusarai on Tuesday.Ashish Chaudhury, Shanu Anand, both MBBS students of 2015 batch doing final year internship; Anand Bhushan and Akash Kumar of 2016 batch, were the other medicos who visited the bereaved family.Begusarai civil surgeon Dr Vinay Kumar Jha confirmed the death. “The student had tested positive on February 25 at Patna. He was admitted to Bhrit Jeevan, a private health facility in Begusarai on February 27, where he died late last night. I don't know if he had any pre-existing disease since post-mortem examination of Covid-19 patients are not done,” said Dr Jha.NMCH principal Dr Hiralal Mahto said that he got to know about the student’s death on Tuesday.“I got to know on February 28 that one of our medicos, residing in one of our hostels, has tested positive for Covid-19. I immediately asked the hostel warden to hospitalise him but was told that he had left the hostel without informing anyone. I got the news about his death today,” said Dr Mahto.Asked about more Covid-19 cases among medicos, Dr Mahto said, “Some of our students have shown symptoms of Covid-19. I have asked all medicos — roughly 700 — to undergo the RT-PCR test. I have even asked those showing symptoms of Covid-19 to get themselves hospitalized, but they are awaiting results of RT-PCR test.”The principal said he had ordered sanitization of the entire hospital and hostel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/barely-22-days-after-taking-first-jab-of-vaccine-medico-dies-of-covid19-101614707989111.html
