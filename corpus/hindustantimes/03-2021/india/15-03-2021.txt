The BJP will bank on five pillars to fight the assembly polls -- ‘Suraksha aur Samman’ (protection and respect), ‘Samriddhi aur Judao’ (prosperity and connection), ‘Sanskriti aur Sabhyata’ (culture and civilisation), ‘Shanti aur Samvad’ (peace and dialogue) and ‘Swanirbharta aur Atmanirbharta’ (Self-reliance), Shah said. “Assam elections will not just ensure that the BJP stays in power, but will also guarantee preservation of the state’s culture, traditions and civilisation,” he said, urging BJP’s social media volunteers to act “marg-darshaks” (guide) “to create awareness on our mission to build golden Assam”.The Congress, which was in power for 15 years in Assam, has allied with the AIUDF and six other parties to fight the election for the 126-member assembly against the BJP-led NDA.Attacking the opposition party for its poll alliance on the second consecutive day, BJP president Nadda said the “Congress has sold its soul to AIUDF”.“In 2006, former Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi said ‘Who is Ajmal?’ He never allowed Ajmal and its communal thoughts to enter into mainstream. But today the Congress party is contesting election by taking help from a communal political party like AIUDF. I don’t know what the son of Tarun Gogoi is thinking right now. I don’t want to say this but Congress has sold its soul to AIUDF. Today Congress leaders are calling Badruddin Ajmal brother and friend, they are bending their heads before Ajmal,” Nadda said.“If we look at ideology of present leaders of the Congress party, they are contesting against left parties in Kerala while in West Bengal they are in friendship with CPM. In Assam they are fighting election with the help of a communal party like AIUDF. And these people are talking about development of the country. I’d like to tell them, first you save your party and the ideology. The country is in a good hand, Modi ji will take care, don’t worry,” Nadda said.Nadda accused the Congress of “latkana” (delaying), “atkana” (stalling) and “bhatkana” (misleading), saying that Prime Minister Narendra Modi only believes in “jodna” (integrating). “It is the Prime Minister who through his initiatives has joined Assam and the Northeast with mainstream India,” Nadda said.Sharpening his attack on the Congress, Nadda said, “Congress party is now talking about 5-gurantee, though I am not aware of what guarantee they are giving, I can assure the people of Assam that Congress can give one guarantee that is corruption.”He was referring to Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra’s recent speech at a rally in Assam, where she launched the Congress’s five-guarantee campaign including the promise to withdraw the Citizen Amendment Act (CAA).The Congress, however, refuted the BJP’s allegations that it allied with communal forces. “These claims are false. AIUDF is not communal and they have not said anything that is communal. The BJP is desperately trying to polarise the election knowing well they are losing,” said Congress leader and leader of opposition Debabrata Saikia.The state will vote in three phases on March 27, April 1 and April 6 for the assembly’s 126 seats.

At this pace, the surplus 30 lakh of rice cannot be evacuated by the start of the next kharif marketing season or till the start of the next calendar year which will greatly hamper the ensuing Rabi procurement and the next Kharif procurement. If like previous years, FCI lifts only 17 lakh tonnes of rice then 13 lakh tonnes of rice will be left with Odisha. Long storage of rice will lead to discolouration and even FCI will then not accept it. Loss of 1 lakh tonnes of rice due to deterioration in quality would mean a loss of about Rs. 320 crore and the state would lose ₹4160 crore this way," the MPs said in their petition.The MPs told Goyal that Odisha's own consumption under PDS and other welfare schemes currently comes to around 24 lakh tonnes of rice and supplying the extra rice under NFSA/SFSS to people of the state will be unethical.In the ensuing kharif marketing season, Odisha has procured nearly 61 lakh tonnes of paddy from farmers, an all time record. "As the growth in the number of farmers selling paddy to the government has gone up, more farmers have benefitted from MSP payment. If the surplus rice is not evacuated, then the paddy procurement by rice millers would come to a halt," the MPs said.The BJD MPs also requested Goyal to release the subsidy due to Odisha over decentralised procurement system.Odisha State Civil Supplies Corporation which is the nodal agency for paddy procurement in Odisha, has so far pending subsidy dues of Rs. 5,616 crore. While the central subsidy is yet to be released, the state-run corporation has borrowed Rs. 19,000 crore to clear the dues of farmers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/warehouses-in-odisha-running-out-of-space-as-fci-slows-down-lifting-rice-101615830736143.html

The Modi government is responsible for the inconvenience being faced by the people," news agency PTI quoted party spokesperson Randeep Surjewala as saying.The two-day strike was called after Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, in her Budget speech on February 1, announced privatisation of two public sector banks as part of the disinvestment plan of the central government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/twoday-nationwide-bank-strike-here-s-how-day-1-panned-out-101615823579594.html
15-03-2021||India||Will discuss racism issue with UK when required: Jaishankar||India has been working with countries around the world, especially in West Asia, to facilitate the return of citizens working or studying there and more than a million people have travelled abroad on Air India flights, external affairs minister S Jaishankar said on Monday. The process of facilitating the return of Indians to their jobs or studies abroad was part of post-pandemic recovery efforts, and India has been actively urging “partner governments to look sympathetically at the employment of our citizens as they chart their own recovery pathway”, the minister said in similar statements in both houses of Parliament. The largest numbers of Indians had returned to countries in West Asia, which is home to some nine million Indian nationals. Over the past few months, the Indian government has called on the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states to speed up the process of allowing Indian workers to return to their jobs. Jaishankar acknowledged that “real challenges” remain to be addressed regarding the economic impact of the pandemic on Indians employed abroad. “The government is fully cognisant of the employment concerns that our people abroad have in the context of the Covid pandemic. Especially in the Gulf, there has been tremendous economic and social disruption that has impacted them. We have softened it somewhat but real challenges are there to be addressed,” he said. “We are aware that there are problems of compensation, re-employment and re-skilling that need solutions. And these are today the core of our agenda with our partner governments,” he added. Jaishankar said the Gulf has been the focal point of India’s endeavours. “In recent months, the prime minister has engaged the leaders of Saudi Arabia, UAE, Qatar and Oman. Under his directions, I have travelled even during the Covid to the UAE, Qatar, Bahrain and Oman to discuss with the governments there the welfare of our people,” he said. “Because of restrictions at their end, such travel was not possible to Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. But I have been in regular touch with their foreign ministers,” he said. Minister of state for external affairs V Muraleedharan also travelled to Oman and the UAE, and India recently hosted the UAE’s foreign minister while the Kuwaiti foreign minister too is expected to visit soon, he added. The Indian government has concluded air transport bubbles, or temporary reciprocal arrangements for commercial passenger services, with 27 countries until the resumption of regular international flights. Air India has operated more than 9,500 flights that took 1.09 million passengers abroad. During visits to West Asia, Jaishankar and Muraleedharan interacted with community organisations and partner governments, and learnt that the “overall picture was that our people were well taken care of during the pandemic by the host authorities”. “From the governments, the message was of appreciation for the responsibility shown by our people amidst the pressures of the pandemic...The support extended from India for the stay and travel of our citizens was warmly acknowledged by community and governments alike. The provision of medical supplies and food items from India as an exceptional gesture to the Gulf during this period clearly had a powerful resonance,” Jaishankar said. “So did the arrival of health professionals and medical staff, especially the dedicated medical team we sent to Kuwait. From our recent interactions, we have reason to expect that partner governments in the Gulf would be helpful in facilitating the early return of many who had been compelled to go back during the pandemic,” he said. The government is also working to help students who returned from abroad during the pandemic to go back to their universities. “Some countries have been more open in this regard than others, obviously reflecting their particular Covid challenge. This, therefore, remains a high priority and our endeavour will be to encourage an early return to normalcy,” Jaishankar said. Indian fishermen too faced difficulties because of the pandemic, especially serious problems faced by those working in Iran. Some Gulf nations also witnessed this, and the “repatriation phase is over and the re-employment one has just started”, he added. The Vande Bharat Mission brought back nearly 4.6 million people from 98 countries, and Kerala received the maximum returnees, followed by Delhi, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu. The UAE was the country from where the maximum number of stranded Indians returned, followed by Saudi Arabia, the US and Qatar. A total of 39% of the returnees were workers, 39% professionals, 6% students and about 8% visitors and 4.7% stranded tourists. The government spent Rs.33.5 crore from the Indian Community Welfare Fund (ICWF) to help Indians stranded abroad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-discuss-racism-issue-with-uk-when-required-jaishankar-101615830710358.html

She claimed that Kamaraj barged into her house, verbally abused her and punched her in her face.On the same day, Electronic City Police registered a case under Indian Penal Code sections 325 (Punishment for voluntarily causing grievous hurt) and 504 (Intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace) against Kamaraj. He was subsequently arrested but let off on bail the same day.On March 11, Thursday, Kamaraj claimed that contrary to the woman’s claim, it was he who was attacked. “As she was hitting me, I tried to block using my hands. When she tried to push my hand away, a ring on her finger hit her nose,” he said.The complaint comes days after Zomato co-founder Deepinder Goyal said the company will take care of the legal cost of the delivery person Kamaraj. “We are also in constant touch with Kamaraj, extending all possible support to make sure both sides of the story come to light and that due process is followed in the spirit of fairness,” Goyal said in a statement.The Electronic City Police said that based on the FIR, they will call Chandranee for questioning at the earliest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/zomato-executive-files-assault-case-against-bengaluru-woman-101615827227301.html
15-03-2021||India||Pakistan must create conducive atmosphere for meaningful dialogue: Foreign Secy||Listing India’s relations with Pakistan as one of the challenges in the neighbourhood, foreign secretary Harsh Shringla on Monday said the onus is on Islamabad to create a conducive atmosphere for a meaningful dialogue.Shringla made the remarks while delivering an address on the theme “What next for the neighbourhood” at Ananta Aspen Centre. He gave an overview of India’s relations with neighbouring countries and connectivity initiatives to boost economic activity.“India desires good neighbourly relations with Pakistan and is committed to addressing issues, if any, bilaterally and peacefully,” Shringla said.“However, any meaningful dialogue can only be held in a conducive atmosphere and the onus is on Pakistan to create such an atmosphere,” he said.The Indian and Pakistani armies recommitted themselves to the ceasefire on the Line of Control (LoC) in Jammu and Kashmir from the midnight of February 24 – the apparent outcome of behind-the-scenes contacts between the two countries.Shringla also listed the situation in Afghanistan and Myanmar as challenges in the political situation in the neighbourhood.“We continue to follow the developments relating to the Afghan peace process. External affairs minister participated virtually at the opening of the intra-Afghan negotiations in September 2020 in Doha,” he said.“The recent developments in Myanmar are a matter of deep concern. We remain concerned that the gains made by Myanmar over the last decades on the path towards democracy, should not be undermined,” Shringla said.India has always been steadfast in its support to the process of democratic transition in Myanmar, “for it to emerge as a stable democratic federal union”, he said.“Our developmental and humanitarian efforts in Myanmar have been aimed at the socio-economic development of the country. We need to continue with these efforts in the interest of the people of Myanmar,” he added.Shringla further said: “We feel that people on the ground should not suffer. India will continue to closely monitor the situation and remain engaged with like-minded countries to meet the hopes and aspirations of the people of the country.”The world community, he said, must work together and lend its meaningful support at this critical juncture so that the people of Myanmar do not suffer.“We are working in the UN Security Council in a constructive manner to facilitate balanced outcomes that could assist in resolving the situation,” Shringla said.The foreign secretary referred to India’s development and connectivity initiatives, noting that lines of credit to its neighbours had jumped from $3.27 billion in 2014 to $14.7 billion in 2020.“In addition, we undertake a large number of quick gestation and high impact projects aimed at benefiting communities directly. We trade more. We invest more in each other. Total trade with Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, the Maldives, Myanmar, Nepal and Sri Lanka has increased from $19.44 billion to $26.455 billion in the last six years,” he said.“These increases have both contributed to and have benefitted from significantly enhanced connectivity and improved border infrastructure,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pakistan-must-create-conducive-atmosphere-for-meaningful-dialogue-foreign-secy-101615826103909.html

All may please be informed that the video being circulated is last year's news being peddled today," the Railway Ministry said.The ministry in a statement said, "It may be noted that express trains and suburban trains currently operational as special trains will continue to run. It is also requested that the passengers may follow covid protocol while travelling."एक खबर में दावा किया जा रहा है कि 31 मार्च तक सभी ट्रेनें रद्द कर दी गई हैं। #PIBFactCheck: यह खबर पुरानी है। @RailMinIndia ने 31 मार्च, 2021 तक ट्रेन रद्द करने का यह फैसला नहीं लिया है। इस पुरानी खबर को गलत संदर्भ में साझा किया जा रहा है। pic.twitter.com/YcZ8Za9Vj1Meanwhile, the Indian Railways has rendered yeoman service during the coronavirus pandemic by transporting 43 lakh migrant labourers, distributing two crore free food packets and making available several hundred coaches to be used as healthcare centres, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MP Ram Kripal Yadav said earlier in the day.Initiating the debate on Demands for Grants of the Ministry of Railways, Yadav said the Indian Railways has been completely changed into a dynamic development-oriented organisation under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the past several years.He said that during the coronavirus pandemic (Covid-19), the railways has offered over 200 coaches to be used as healthcare centres, 43 lakh migrant labours were transported through hundreds of special trains, two crore free food packets were distributed while 55,000 litres of drinking water have also been given to the poor.Criticising the previous United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government for announcing many railway projects, he said that everything has changed after the Modi government came to power and every decision is taken in the interest of the nation.He said 513 projects worth ₹1.83 lakh crore have been completed during the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government while "annual expenditure on new projects has gone up to ₹45,000 crore in 2020-21 from a mere ₹11,527 crore in 2009-10".He said priority has been given to northeastern states and states like West Bengal and Kerala, ruled by opposition parties. "There has been no discrimination against any state during the Modi government," he added.Referring to the Modern Coach Factory in Raebareli, he said it was established during the UPA rule but "had not produced even a single railway coach till the NDA government came." Since the NDA government came to power, production has started and so far 1,500 coaches have been built and some of them exported abroad, he added.(With iinputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/misleading-railways-clarifies-report-on-cancellation-of-trains-from-march-31-101615823477286.html

The strike called by the United Forum of Bank Union is against the ill-placed priorities of the Modi government. The Modi government is responsible for the inconvenience being faced by the people,” he said.Surjewala stated that there is no rationale for selling state-owned lenders to private players--foreign or domestic--and alleged that this is yet again a desperate attempt to meet the disinvestment target of ₹1.75 lakh crore.He said experts like former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan have red-flagged the move, calling it a “colossal mistake”.The Congress leader also accused the government of "running away" from its responsibility of ensuring better governance in public sector banks by "recklessly selling" such lenders."What we really need is higher accountability of public sector banks and not their outright sale. These banks have been at the forefront of lending to priority sectors like public infrastructure roads and also rural areas which need financing," he said.Surjewala said a very large part of the country’s population lives in rural areas and are involved in agriculture, adding that “we need public sector banks for outreach and to ensure banking is more accessible to the largest number of population that we have in villages and smaller towns, which are not high on the priority list of private lenders”.He said the whole idea of bank nationalisation was to bring banking closer to every Indian. PSU banks are not just profit-making ventures. They have been in the past used as vehicles of social reforms, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bank-strike-congress-lends-support-says-modi-govt-responsible-for-inconvenience-to-public-101615819652523.html

The flood happened due to the flood caused by the glacier meltdown and not due to the power plant. An inquiry is already on in this regard," he said.Javadekar said there are a total of 37,000 glaciers and some of them are receding and some are increasing."In the last six years, the Jal Shakti, Environment and Energy ministries together decided not to grant any fresh permissions to new hydel power projects in the Upper Ganges region. But, we need hydel power in the country as it is clean power.

Chudasama, who is a Congress representative in the assembly, was reprimanded by the Speaker a week ago for a similar offence.Chudasama, who represents the assembly constituency of Somnath, was reminded by Trivedi on Monday of the warning given to him last week and asked to come back after changing into a proper attire like a shirt, kurta, or a blazer, reported news agency PTI.Following this, a minor altercation broke out between Chudasama and Trivedi as the Congress leader said since he campaigned for elections in t-shirts it carries the stamp of approval of his voters. He added that questioning it is equivalent to “insulting his voters”. "I sought votes wearing a t-shirt. This t-shirt is a certificate given to me by my voters. You are disrespecting my voters," Chudasama said to the Speaker of the House, reported PTI.Trivedi disregarded Chudasama’s words and accused him of disrespecting the Speaker. He reminded the MLA that the assembly has its own set of protocols to follow and he has to abide by it. "I don't want to know how you approached your voters. You are disrespecting the Speaker's order. You can't come to the House wearing whatever you want just because you are an MLA. This is not a playground. There are protocols to follow," PTI said quoting Trivedi.A Congress MLA was also suspended from the Karnataka assembly on March 4 for removing his shirt during a House session, according to a PTI report. BK Sangamesh, the Congress MLA from Bhadravathi, had done it as an act of protest during a discussion on ‘One Nation One Election’.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/not-a-playground-congress-mla-evicted-from-gujarat-assembly-for-wearing-tshirt-101615814023068.html

15-03-2021||India||India will take up incidents of racism with UK, says S Jaishankar||India will take up incidents of racism in the UK with the British government, external affairs minister S Jaishankar said on Monday against the backdrop of strains caused by a debate on the farmers’ protest in the British Parliament.Jaishankar made the remarks while responding to concerns raised in Rajya Sabha by BJP lawmaker Ashwini Vaishnaw, who contended that racism and cyber-bullying forced Rashmi Samant, the first Indian woman elected president of the Oxford University Student Union, to quit her post.“What I do want to say is that we have strong ties with the UK, we will take up such matters with great candour when required. We will monitor these developments very, very closely,” he said in his response after Vaishnaw brought up the matter through a zero hour mention.“We will raise it when required and we will always champion the fight against racism and other forms of intolerance,” Jaishankar said.He further said: “I do want to say that as the land of Mahatma Gandhi, we can never ever turn our eyes away from racism, wherever it is, particularly when it is in a country where we have such a large diaspora. As a friend of the UK, we also have concerns about its reputational impact.”Vaishnaw also referred to the issue of alleged racism within the UK royal family that was brought up in a recent interview by Meghan Markle, the wife of Prince Harry. Noting that the behaviour of a society is a reflection of its beliefs and value systems, Vaishnaw said: “If such practices of racial discrimination are followed at the highest level in a society, what would be the following at the lower levels?”He also contended migrants were poorly treated and segregated in the UK and this was a matter of concern in India because of the large diaspora in Britain. Vaishnaw also claimed a recent report had said the death rate among people of Asian origin because of Covid-19 was higher than the death rate of other communities in the UK.Samant quit as president of the Oxford University Student Union after the emergence of old social media posts that were deemed to be “racist” and “insensitive” by groups representing Asian and Jewish students. She also upset others by comparing imperialist Cecil Rhodes to Adolf Hitler in a Student Union debate and separating “women” and “transwomen” in an Instagram caption.She initially offered an apology for the social media posts, some dating back to 2017, but later stepped down as president-elect after facing continued criticism. Since returning to India, Samant has claimed she was unfairly targeted.The remarks in Rajya Sabha came about a week after the foreign secretary summoned British envoy Alex Ellis to protest against what it said was an “unwarranted and tendentious” debate in the UK Parliament that saw lawmakers criticise the Indian government’s handling of the farmers’ protest.The debate was held in response to a public petition that garnered more than 115,000 signatures, and saw Labour, Conservative, Liberal Democratic and Scottish National Party lawmakers calling on the Boris Johnson government to raise their concerns about the handling of the protest and media freedoms with the Indian government.Most of the British MPs who joined the debate acknowledged India’s agricultural reforms were a domestic matter but noted their constituents had strong links with India’s farm sector and were upset by what they described as the use of force against protesting farmers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-will-take-up-incidents-of-racism-with-uk-says-s-jaishankar-101615813266575.html

CRPF units and formations have been briefed about them. We have to be very careful about them because they work with timer devices. Everyone has to remain cautious about them"."As far as convoys are concerned, they are always protected. We have to ensure that they ply in a secured environment," he added.The IG also said that various lodging centers and Yatri Niwas base camp in Jammu will be secured 24x7 by QRTs. The CRPF largely shoulders the responsibility of Amarnath Yatra's security every year.Police, Army and other paramilitary forces chip in with their bit to keep it safe.This year the annual pilgrimage will end on August 22.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/crpf-preps-to-secure-56-day-amarnath-yatra-amid-terror-threats-101615811832784.html

Agrawal said that he was ashamed of this act of Kamal Nath and he announced to hold a protest against it.A disciplinary committee of the Madhya Pradesh unit of the Congress on Monday suspended Agrawal from the party for the next six years, said KK Mishra, general secretary, Madhya Pradesh Congress Committee.Mishra said, “In many internal meetings, the party leaders have been told to follow the discipline and respect each other but Agrawal, who might have been upset with the party leadership for some other reason, raised questions against the party president and also gave anti-party statements.”But the MPCC has not taken any action against former minister and senior Congress leader Arun Yadav, who had written an open letter against induction of Chaurasiya.Mishra said, “Yadav had shared only his personal opinion. He didn’t attack any party leader and didn’t say anything against the party. His letter was on the ideology of the party. Yadav also met Kamal Nath and explained his purpose of writing the letter. The party found his explanation satisfactory so no action will be taken against him.”However, Manak Agrawal said he was a member of the All India Congress Committee (AICC) so MPCC cannot take action against him.Babulal Chaurasiya, a former corporator from Gwalior, who played an important role in building a temple dedicated to Nathuram Godse in November 2017, joined the Congress party on February 25 the presence of former chief minister Kamal Nath.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-suspends-senior-leader-in-mp-who-opposed-induction-of-godse-admirer-101615810088830.html

Some protesters later entered the iconic Red Fort and unfurled a Sikh religious flag there.“Till Jan. 26, we were supporting them but then we found out that all these organisations at Tikri, Singhu and Ghazipur borders were Congress-sponsored. When they attacked police and hoisted another flag at Red Fort, we withdrew our support and came back,” Bhanu Pratap, who withdrew from the stir on January 27, said, according to news agency ANI.#WATCH 26 जनवरी को हमें मालूम पड़ा था कि जितने भी संगठन सिंघु बॉर्डर, गाज़ीपुर बॉर्डर, टिकरी बॉर्डर पर आंदोलन कर रहे थे। ये सब कांग्रेस के खरीदे हुए और कांग्रेस के भेजे हुए संगठन थे। कांग्रेस इनको फंडिंग कर रही थी: भारतीय किसान यूनियन (भानु) के राष्ट्रीय अध्यक्ष भानु प्रताप सिंह pic.twitter.com/lEivlJe1G3“We'll talk to the Centre for a solution and tell them to form a farmers' committee which will advise on MSP (Minimum Support Price).

Farmers from Uttar Pradesh, under the leadership of Rakesh Tikait, are camped at Ghazipur, the state’s border with Delhi. The Sanyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), an umbrella body of various farmers' organisations, is leading the protests, which have been going on since November 26 last year.Total 11 rounds of talks have failed to break the deadlock between the Union government and farmers, with the last round taking place on Jan. 22. Farmers’ unions have now formed teams to go to poll-bound West Bengal, Assam, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Puducherry, to urge voters to not vote for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which has a government at the Centre. Also, with summer on the horizon, farmers have started building permanent structures at the borders for their accommodation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sponsored-by-congress-says-bku-bhanu-chief-on-unions-protesting-farm-laws-101615809222710.html
15-03-2021||India||Over 383 Myanmarese have crossed over to Mizoram from the trouble-torn country: Official||At least 383 Myanmar nationals, including women and children, have so far sneaked into Mizoram seeking refuge since late February following military coup and subsequent crackdown on pro-democracy movement in the neighbouring country, a state home department official said on Monday.He said about 98 per cent of the Myanmar nationals entering Mizoram claimed that they belonged to police force and fire service. But, they don't have documentary proofs in support of the claim, the official said. Of the 383 foreign nationals, 297 have been already verified while 86 are yet to be verified or confirmed, the official said. "As per the state home department record as on Monday, 383 people from Myanmar have already entered five Mizoram districts and 86 of them are yet to be confirmed," the official told PTI on condition of anonymity. Six Mizoram districts- Champhai, Lawngtlai, Siaha, Saitual, Hnahthial and Serchhip- share a 510 km long porous international border with Myanmar's Chin state. According to the official, among the six border districts, only Saitual district has not reported any influx of refugees from the trouble-torn country after the coup. He said that many of them were accommodated by the locals as a mark of showing hospitality towards strangers, which is part of tradition of the Mizos. Though the state government and Assam Rifles were trying their best to prevent illegal influx, the Myanmar nationals, who had already entered the state due to humanitarian crisis, could not be prevented due to the porous border. The state government could not immediately push them back on humanitarian ground, he said. Speaking to PTI, Lalramnghaka, village council president of Lungkawlh village in Serchhip district, said that at least 19 Myanmarese are currently taking refuge there. While three persons were accommodated by a family in North Vanlaiphai village, 16 others are being provided foods and other reliefs by residents of Lungkawlh village by raising community fund, he said. Chief Minister Zoramthanga and Home Minister Lalchamliana had earlier said that the state government will on humanitarian ground provide relief to the Myanmar nationals, who have entered the state due to the humanitarian crisis. The Union Home Ministry on Friday cautioned four Northeastern states -- Mizoram, Manipur, Nagaland and Arunachal Pradesh -- bordering Myanmar against influx from the neighbouring country in the wake of largescale protests following a coup there, and asked them to take appropriate actions as per law. In a communication, the home ministry told the four states to guard against influx of civilians and government officials from Myanmar and take all precautions to deal with any such situation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/over-383-myanmarese-have-crossed-over-to-mizoram-from-the-trouble-torn-country-official-101615809218716.html
15-03-2021||India||Rajnath Singh urges for dialogue between government, protesting farmers||Defence Minister Rajnath Singh on Monday urged dialogue between the protesting farmers and the Centre while addressing a meeting of BJP office-bearers, during which he also invoked the border clashes with China and the construction of the Ram temple.Making an appeal to farmers upset over the new agri-marketing laws, the senior BJP leader said any problem can be resolved through talks."The BJP resolve is to double the farmers’ income, and in no case the MSP will end,” he said, referring to the apprehension among farmers camping at Delhi’s borders for months now.“We are all from farmers' families and we are ready for amendments and solutions, whatever is needed in the interest of agriculture," Singh said at the inaugural meeting of the Uttar Pradesh BJP executive committee.He highlighted the role of grassroots workers in the Bharatiya Janata Party and said this was the only party which has not seen a split so far.“This is not a crowd of workers aiming to gain power but a lively party which has a political vision,” he said.He referred to the recently begun construction of a Ram temple in Ayodhya, after the historic verdict in the Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid land dispute."People used to say that whenever elections come, BJP leaders speak about construction of the Ram temple,” he said, referring to the foundation laying ceremony last year.“It is a coincidence that when the structure fell in Ayodhya, there was a BJP government in UP, and Kalyan Singh was the chief minister. And when the foundation stone for construction of the Ram temple was laid, there was a BJP government in UP, and Yogi ji was the chief minister," Singh said alluding to the demolition of the Babri mosque, and the more recent development.On the face-off with China in Ladakh last year, the minister said, "Our Army jawans displayed courage and valour with patience. We don’t wish to attack anyone but will not tolerate the grabbing of our land."He said no power on earth can stop India from becoming a global superpower.Singh claimed that in the 2022 UP Assembly elections the BJP will get more seats than its 2017 tally.Addressing party workers, he said they cannot complain of any injustice to them by the party, though there can be “delays”Giving his own example, Singh said he did not make any demands from the party and just kept working. "We are lucky that we got an opportunity to become BJP worker," he added."Credibility is the biggest capital in politics,” he said, giving the example of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.“Be it the abrogation of Article 370, triple talaq or bhoomi pujan for the construction of the Ram temple in Ayodhya, there has been no doubt over our credibility. We do not indulge in politics of caste or religion, but that of humanity," he said.Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, Deputy CMs Keshav Prasad Maurya and Dinesh Sharma and UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh attended the meeting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajnath-singh-urges-for-dialogue-between-government-protesting-farmers-101615808267969.html

15-03-2021||India||All-party meet in Bihar to discuss prohibition remains inconclusive||An all-party meeting called by Bihar assembly Speaker Vijay Kumar Sinha on Monday to decide on the Opposition’s demand for a debate on prohibition remained inconclusive, people familiar with the matter said.The day’s session got underway smoothly soon after with the question hour without any reference to what transpired in the chamber of the Speaker from any side.The meeting was called following er heated exchanges between the treasury and the opposition benches on Thursday after leader of opposition Tejashwi Yadav levelled serious charges against Ram Surat Kumar, a minister in the Nitish Kumar cabinet, and described prohibition as a failure. He raised the issue of recovery of liquor bottles from a school with which the minister’s brother is associated and an FIR that has also been lodged in the case.Though there was no official statement about the outcome of the meeting, people familiar with the development said the government made it clear that the minister would not give any clarification on the matter and that the opposition should first allow the House to run properly. The Speaker also did not decide on any special debate.The Speaker could not be contacted for comments.The opposition RJD had also demanded an adjournment motion three days ago on the issue of recovery of liquor from the school the minister’s kin is associated with and later, after an ugly spat with the BJP, staged a walkout. The RJD also took out a march to the Raj Bhawan, alleging failure of prohibition due to rampant smuggling that have been underlined by frequent seizures.With the demand for adjournment motion rejected by the Speaker, Tejaswhi insisted that there should be debate on the matter in the House. The Speaker then called an all-party meeting to discuss the matter.Four ministers, including parliamentary affairs minister Vijay Kumar Choudhary, deputy chief minister Tar Kishore Prasad, energy minister Bijendra Prasad Yadav and rural development minister Shravan Kumar, leader of opposition Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, Congress legislature party leader Ajeet Sharma, former chief minister Jitan Ram Manjhi of HAM-S and other legislature party leaders attended the meeting at 10 am.Ahead of the meeting, BJP spokesman Nikhil Anand hit out at Tejashwi for making an issue out of nothing to discredit prohibition which was actually aimed at the betterment of the society. “The way the Opposition is doing propaganda about prohibition, it seems it is hand in glove with the liquor mafia. They should try to contribute in making prohibition a success for the larger good of the society they are also part of,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/allparty-meet-in-bihar-to-discuss-prohibition-remains-inconclusive-101615807380283.html
15-03-2021||India||Government says ₹2,000 notes not been printed in last 2 years||₹2,000 currency notes have not been printed in the last two years even as the quantum of India's highest denomination currency note has come down, the Lok Sabha was informed Monday. In a written reply, Minister of State for Finance Anurag Singh Thakur said 3,362 million currency notes of ₹2000 denomination were in circulation on March 30, 2018, constituting 3.27 per cent and 37.26 per cent of the currency in terms of volume and trade respectively. As of February 26, 2021, 2,499 million pieces of ₹2,000 notes were in circulation, constituting 2.01 per cent and 17.78 per cent of banknotes in terms of volume and value, respectively. "Printing of banknotes of a particular denomination is decided by the government in consultation with RBI to maintain desired denomination mix for facilitating transactional demand of the public."During the years 2019-20 and 2020-21, no indent has been placed with the presses for printing of ₹2000 denomination banknotes," he said.The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had in 2019 stated that 3,542.991 million notes of ₹2,000 were printed during the financial year 2016-17 (April 2016 to March 2017). However, in 2017-18, only 111.507 million notes were printed, which further reduced to 46.690 million notes in the year 2018-19. No new ₹2,000 currency notes were printed since April 2019. The move is seen as an attempt to prevent hoarding of the high-value currency and thus, curb black money. The ₹2,000 notes were introduced in November 2016, soon after the government withdrew ₹500 and ₹1,000 notes in an attempt to curb black money and fake currencies. While a new ₹500 note was printed, ₹1,000 currency notes were discontinued. Instead, ₹2,000 note was introduced. Besides ₹2000, the other currency notes in circulation are of the denomination ₹10, ₹20, ₹50 and ₹100.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/government-says-rs-2-000-notes-not-been-printed-in-last-2-years-101615806558293.html

15-03-2021||India||Parliament session: Centre introduces Bill to give more powers to Delhi L-G||The ministry of home affairs on Monday introduced in Lok Sabha a controversial Bill that gives overarching powers to the Lieutenant Governor (L-G) of Delhi in day-to-day functioning of the national Capital, a move which is set to revive the tussle between Aam Aadmi Party-led Delhi government and the Centre. According to the Bill, Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi (Amendment) Act, 2021, the “government” in Delhi would mean L-G in context of all legislations to be passed by the state assembly. The statement of objects and reasons of the Bill said this is in consistency with the status of Delhi as a Union Territory to address the ambiguities in the interpretation of the legislative provisions. The Bill makes it mandatory for the Delhi government to take the opinion of the L-G before any executive action in the city. It also bars Delhi government from making any rule to enable itself or its committees to consider the matters of day-to-day administration of the Capital or conduct inquiries in relation to the administrative decisions. Any rule made till this Act comes into effect will be void, according to the Bill. Also Read | Parliament session: Bill to amend juvenile justice law introduced in Lok SabhaIt further says that the Delhi assembly won’t be able to make rules for regulating, its procedure and the conduct of its business which are inconsistent with the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in the Parliament of India. The Supreme Court had, on July 4, 2018, ruled that the L-G cannot interfere in every decision of the Delhi government and that he must act on aid and advice of the council of ministers. Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal accused the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) of seeking to drastically curtail the powers of an elected government in Delhi, which he added was contrary to the judgement by a constitution bench of the SC. He tweeted, “After being rejected by ppl of Delhi (8 seats in Assembly, 0 in MCD bypolls), BJP seeks to drastically curtail powers of elected government through a Bill in LS today. Bill is contrary to Constitution Bench judgement. We strongly condemn BJP’s unconstitutional n anti-democracy move.” “The Bill says- 1. For Delhi, “Govt” will mean L-G Then what will elected govt do? … 2. All files will go to L-G. This is against 4.7.18 Constitution Bench judgement which said that files will not be sent to L-G, elected govt will take all decisions and send copy of decision to L-G,” he said in another tweet,” Kejriwal said in another tweet. The new NCT Bill, according to the Centre, seeks to clarify the expression of government in order to give effect to the interpretation made by the Supreme Court. “The Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi Act, 1991 (1of 1992) was enacted to supplement the provisions of the Constitution relating to the Legislative Assembly and a Council of Ministers for the National Capital Territory of Delhi and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto. Section 44 of the Act deals with conduct of business and there is no structural mechanism provided in the act for effective time bound implementation of said section. Further, there is no clarity as to what proposal or matters are required to be submitted to Lieutenant Governor before issuing order thereon,” the statement of objects and reasons stated. “It further seeks to ensure that the L-G is necessarily granted an opportunity to exercise the power entrusted to him under proviso to clause (4) of article 239AA of the Constitution, in select category of cases and also to make rules in matters which incidentally encroach upon matters falling outside the preview of the Legislative Assembly. It also seeks to provide for rules made by the Legislative Assembly of Delhi to be consistent with the rules of the House of the People,” it added. The Bill, the statement added, will “promote harmonious relations between the legislature and the executive, and further define the responsibilities of the elected government and the Lieutenant Governor, in line with the constitutional scheme of governance of NCT of Delhi, as interpreted by the Supreme Court.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/parliament-session-centre-introduces-bill-to-give-more-powers-to-delhi-lg-101615807370435.html

15-03-2021||India||Bill to define role, powers of Delhi LG introduced in Lok Sabha||With the objective of giving a proper "interpretation" of a Supreme Court ruling, the government on Monday introduced a bill in Lok Sabha that seeks to define certain role and powers of the Lieutenant Governor of Delhi.Union Minister of State for Home G Kishan Reddy introduced the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi (Amendment) Bill, 2021.According to proposed amendments, Section 21 of the Act -- dealing with restrictions on laws passed by legislative assembly with respect to certain matters -- is sought to be revised to clarify that the expression 'government' referred to in any law to be made by the legislative assembly shall mean the 'Lieutenant Governor'. A sub-section shall be inserted to this effect in Section 21.In section 24 of the principal Act -- which requires a Bill passed by the Delhi legislative assembly to be presented to the LG who may assent, withhold or reserve it for consideration of the President -- an additional clause will be inserted to cover any of the matters that fall outside the purview of the powers conferred on the legislative assembly.In Section 33 of the principal Act, in sub-section (1) after the words "conduct of its business", the words "which shall not be inconsistent with the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in House of People" shall be inserted.Also, in the proviso, for the words "Provided that", the following shall be substituted, "Provided that the Legislative Assembly shall not make any rule to enable itself or its Committees to consider the matters of day-to-day administration of the Capital or conduct inquiries in relation to the administrative decisions, and any of the rule made in contravention of this proviso, before the commencement of the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi (Amendment) Act, 2021, shall be void".In section 44 of the principal Act dealing with powers to makes rules for conduct of business, in sub-section (2) -- which states that as otherwise provided in this Act, all executive action of the Lieutenant Governor whether taken on the advice of his Ministers or otherwise shall be expressed to be taken in the name of the Lieutenant Governor -- the following proviso shall be inserted, namely "Provided that before taking any executive action in pursuance of the decision of the Council of Ministers or a Minister, to exercise powers of Government, State Government, Appropriate Government, Lieutenant Governor, Administrator or Chief Commissioner, as the case may be, under any law in force in the Capital, the opinion of Lieutenant Governor in term of proviso to clause (4) of article 239AA of the Constitution shall be obtained on all such matters as may be specified, by a general or special order, by Lieutenant Governor".According to the statement of objects and reasons of the bill, the original bill was enacted to supplement the provisions of the Constitution relating to the legislative assembly and a Council of Ministers for Delhi and for matters connected therewith."The section 44 of the act deals with conduct of business and there is no structural mechanism provided in the act for effective time bound implementation of said section. Further, there is no clarity as to what proposal or matters are required to be submitted to the LG before issuing order thereon," it said.It said that to give effect to the interpretation made by the Supreme Court which had ruled that the city government need not obtain the Lieutenant Governor's "concurrence" of every issue of day-to-day governance, the bill has been brought.The government said it wanted to clarify the expression "Government", which in the context of legislations to be passed by the Delhi assembly, shall mean the LG of Delhi, consistent with the status of Delhi as a Union Territory to address the ambiguities in the interpretation of the legislative provisions.It further seeks to ensure that the LG is necessarily granted an opportunity to exercise the power entrusted to him under proviso to clause (4) of article 239AA of the Constitution, in select category of cases and also to make rules in matters which incidentally encroach upon matters falling outside the preview of the assembly."The said bill will promote harmonious relations between the legislature and the executive, and further define the responsibilities of the elected government and the LG, in line with the constitutional scheme of governance of National Capital Territory of Delhi, as interpreted by the Hon'ble Supreme Court," the statement of objects said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bill-to-define-role-powers-of-delhi-lg-introduced-in-lok-sabha-101615804959211.html

So we need to be more cautious in organising mega religious fair like Mahakumbh,” Trivendra Singh Rawat said after paying obeisance at Parad Shivlingam, Mahamrityunjay temple at Hari Har ashram."Seven states in recent weeks have shown a sharp rise in Covid infection spread. Lockdown type measures are being adhered to by some state governments so we need to be cautious when it comes to a global fair like Mahakumbh in which pilgrims from across the country and other countries arrive to take a sacred dip in the Ganga," he said.When questioned that CM Tirath Singh Rawat a day before announced that pilgrims need not possess negative Covid-19 reports 72 hours prior to their arrival in Haridwar, Trivendra Singh Rawat said that Mahakumbh is for everyone but Covid -19 has impacted every global and national event."We should make arrangements in such a way that Covid infection doesn't spread further as exactly a year has passed since the country and the whole world was affected by the pandemic. Risks cannot be taken at this stage at such a global fair," the former chief minister said.Later Rawat also met spiritual leader Acharya Mahamandaleshwar Swami Avdeshanand Giri.Meanwhile, Akhil Bharatiya Akhada Parishad president Shri Mahant Narendra Giri urged the CM to direct the Kumbh Mela administration to set up camps, tents and food courts for Akhada saints."We welcome the new CM’s stance of easing restrictions for saints and pilgrims during Mahakumbh. This fair should now be held on the lines of the grand fair held in 2010.Some officials sitting in Dehradun mislead former CM Trivendra Singh Rawat, so new CM Tirath Singh Rawat should be cautious of such officials. Mahakumbh comes in 12 years.

We will study the logistic requirements needed at the Yatri camps and might require more forces," he added.To a question on the number of troops required for the pilgrimage, the IG said, "That will be decided by the government after a review of the overall situation."The CRPF officer said quick reaction teams (QRTs) would be deployed wherever required, including in yatri camps and along the 270-km Jammu-Srinagar national highway."Personnel who will be deployed on yatra duty will also undergo pre-induction training like in the past," Ranpise said.He said the CRPF has adequate deployment along the highway and would be utilising drones and other technology during the yatra.On the recent recovery of sticky bombs and measures taken by the force to counter the threat, he said, "I agree with police that it is a serious matter as the timer-activated devices are easy to use against civilian and security targets.""We have already alerted our units and formations, and briefed them about the new threat. We have to remain alert (to counter the terrorist plan)," the officer said.He said CRPF convoys always take necessary precautionary measures before proceedings towards their destinations and usually remain protected."We have to ensure that our convoys have minimum contact with the public, and there should be no unnecessary halting. Strict vigil and precautionary measures need to be taken (against sticky bombs)," he said.Hundreds of locals availed the free medical camp.CRPF spokesperson Shivnandan Singh said the force is organising medical camps on a daily basis in different areas to reach out to the people as part of a goodwill programme.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-make-arrangements-for-peaceful-pilgrimage-crpf-on-amarnath-yatra-101615804417727.html
15-03-2021||India||India’s arms imports down by 33%, says Sipri report||India’s arms imports fell 33 % between 2011-15 and 2016-20, said a report released by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (Sipri) on Monday, at a time the country has taken a raft of measures to cut dependence on imported military hardware.  The report on international arms transfers attributed the drop in India’s arms imports mainly to an attempt to reduce its dependence on Russian arms and complex procurement processes.  “Russia was the most affected supplier, although India’s imports of US arms also fell by 46%,” the report said, adding that India is planning large-scale arms imports in the coming years from several suppliers. India’s top three arms suppliers during 2016-20 were Russia (accounting for 49% of India’s imports), France (18%) and Israel (13%), the report said.According to Sipri, India accounted for 0.2% of the share of global arms exports during 2016-20, making the country the world’s 24th largest exporter of major arms. This represents an increase of 228% over India’s export share of 0.1 % during the previous five-year period of 2011-15. Myanmar, Sri Lanka and Mauritius were the top recipients of Indian military hardware, the report said.The latest import data is a clear indicator that the country’s drive towards Atmanirbharta is showing results, said Air Marshal Anil Chopra (retd), director general, Centre for Air Power Studies. “India is finally at an inflection point and the Indian defence industry is coming of age,” he said.Arms exports by Russia, which accounted for 20% of all exports of major arms in 2016–20, dropped by 22%, the report said. “The bulk -- around 90% -- of this decrease was attributable to a 53% fall in its arms exports to India,” Sipri said.  India was the biggest importer of Russian military hardware during the last five years, accounting for 23% of Russia’s total exports.It also said that exports by China, the world’s fifth largest arms exporter in 2016-20, fell 7.8% between 2011-15 and 2016-20. China accounted for 74% of Pakistan’s military imports during the last five years, up from 61% in 2011-15. “Pakistan is now firmly in China’s hold for its arms requirements,” Chopra said. Also Read | Deepening India-UAE defence cooperation enlarges India’s footprint in West AsiaBut the United States, the world’s largest arms exporter, saw its exports rise. Its global share of exports went up from 32% to 37% between 2011-15 and 2016-20. The five largest arms exporters in 2016-20 were the US, Russia, France, Germany and China, while the top importers were Saudi Arabia, India, Egypt, Australia and China.India has set aside ₹70,221 crore - 63% of the military’s capital budget for 2021-22 for buying locally produced weapons and systems to boost defence indigenisation. The allocation for indigenous procurement -- made for the second consecutive year -- will power the purchase of Tejas LCA (light combat aircraft) Mk-1A jets, light combat helicopters (LCHs), basic trainer aircraft, Arjun Mk-1A tanks, Astra beyond-visual-range missiles, Pinaka rocket systems and anti-tank missiles, as previously reported by Hindustan Times. The budget will be used for making milestone payments for several domestic acquisitions through the year. Such payments refer to a certain percentage of the total deal amount that has to be paid at different stages of the execution of a contract. Last year, the ministry spent over ₹51,000 crore, or 58% of the capital budget, on domestic purchases. The ₹48,000-crore contract for 83 LCA Mk-1A jets, awarded to Hindustan Aeronautics Limited last month, is the biggest indigenous defence procurement deal so far.  Basic trainers and LCHs figure on the government’s negative import list that seeks to ban the import of 101 different types of weapons, systems and ammunition over the next five years. This year, the government is likely to notify a second list of weapons, systems and ammunition that cannot be imported.  India will sign a $2.5-billion contract this year for buying 56 medium transport aircraft for IAF to replace its fleet of ageing Avro-748 planes.  Airbus Defence and Space and Tata Advanced Systems Limited will jointly execute the project to equip the air force with 56 C-295 transport aircraft under the Make-in-India initiative in the aerospace sector.But Sipri said India’s military imports are likely to grow over the next five years. “As India perceives increasing threats from Pakistan and China and as its ambitious plans to produce its own major arms have been significantly delayed, it is planning large-scale programmes for arms imports. Based on its outstanding deliveries of combat aircraft, air defence systems, ships and submarines, India’s arms imports are expected to increase over the coming five years,” the report said.It is a clear indicator that the country’s drive towards Atmanirbharta is showing results, said Air Marshal Anil Chopra (retd), director general, Centre for Air Power Studies. “India is finally at an inflection point and the Indian defence industry is coming of age,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indias-arms-imports-down-by-33-says-sipri-report-101615806230302.html
15-03-2021||India||SC notice to Centre, EC on plea to nullify election result if most votes for NOTA||The Supreme Court on Monday agreed to examine a public interest litigation (PIL) that seeks fresh polls in constituencies where voters reject all candidates by casting maximum votes in favour of the NOTA (None of the Above).A bench, headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde, issued notices to the Central government and the Election Commission of India (EC), seeking their replies in four weeks to the PIL by Ashwini Upadhyay, a Supreme Court lawyer and a member of the Bharatiya Janata Party. Representing Upadhyay, senior advocate Menaka Gurusway submitted before the bench that the petition has sought formalisation of the voters’ right to reject so that fresh elections should be conducted where NOTA received votes more than any other candidate in the fray. The bench, which also included justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian, was initially reluctant to admit the plea. “The problem is that if a political party with sufficient influence on the voters gets many candidates rejected, the Parliament will not be constituted properly. If many candidates are rejected, those constituencies will go unrepresented. How will you constitute a proper Parliament then?” it asked Guruswamy. Also Read | Has the Supreme Court set the ball rolling for a Uniform Civil Code?The senior counsel replied that there had been recommendations even by the EC that fresh polls could be held where NOTA got maximum votes. Guruswamy added that the present situation was untenable since even if 99% of votes were polled in favour of NOTA, a candidate who got just one vote could still be declared elected since NOTA had no real consequences on the results of an election. “A right to reject will prompt the political parties to be more careful in putting up candidates and those with clean records would be put up,” she said.The bench retorted that it found it “difficult to accept an underlying assumption” that the parties did not wish to put such candidates otherwise, but agreed, at the same time, to examine the matter. Upadhyay’s PIL has sought directions for the EC to use its plenary power under Article 324 to nullify the election result and hold fresh polls if NOTA got maximum votes in a constituency. It further sought to restrict the candidates, who had earlier participated in the invalidated election, from contesting the fresh poll.In the alternative, Upadhyay has said that the Centre should be directed to come up with appropriate steps, including suitable amendments in the law, so as to empower the voters with a right to reject with consequences on an election. The petition cited the 2013 judgment by the Supreme Court, which had issued directives to the EC for introducing NOTA, recognising the voters’ right not to vote and choose NOTA to express discontent and dissatisfaction.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-notice-to-centre-ec-on-plea-to-nullify-election-result-if-most-votes-for-nota-101615805570240.html

15-03-2021||India||Has the Supreme Court set the ball rolling for a Uniform Civil Code?||It has been more than four decades since the Supreme Court set a legal milestone in the battle for protection of rights of Muslim women and dwelt on the need to implement a Uniform Civil Code (UCC) in the matter famously known as Shah Bano case. Last week, the top court sought a reply from the Central government over religion-neutral inheritance and succession laws in India. Supreme Court lawyer and a member of the Bharatiya Janta Party (BJP), Ashwini Upadhyay, has succeeded in getting five such petitions admitted by the apex court that can be seen as a precursor to a UCC in the country. What exactly is a Uniform Civil Code and why do the proceedings in the Supreme Court matter? What is UCC? UCC essentially refers to a common set of laws governing personal matters such as marriage, divorce, adoption, inheritance and succession for all citizens of the country, irrespective of religion. Currently, different laws regulate these aspects for adherents of different religions and a UCC is meant to do away with these inconsistent personal laws. These laws include the Hindu Marriage Act, Hindu Succession Act, Indian Christian Marriages Act, Indian Divorce Act, Parsi Marriage and Divorce Act. However, Muslim personal laws are not codified and are based on their religious texts, though certain aspects of these are expressly recognised through laws such as the Shariat Application Act and Dissolution of Muslim Marriages Act. What does the Constitution say about UCC? Article 44 of the Constitution, which is one of the Directive Principles of State Policy, says: “The State shall endeavour to secure for the citizens a Uniform Civil Code throughout the territory of India.” Directive Principles, as Article 37 makes clear, are not enforceable by any court but lays down at the same time that these are nevertheless fundamental in the governance of the country and it shall be the duty of the State to apply these principles in making laws. Also Read | SC issues notice on plea to nullify election result if maximum votes for NOTAA body of judicial precedents, including the famous Minerva Mills Case (1980), have held that the harmony and balance between Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles of State Policy was an essential feature of the basic structure of the Constitution. “The Indian Constitution is founded on the bedrock of the balance between the Fundamental Rights and the Directive Principles,” held this judgment. Similarly, in Dalmia Cement Case (1996), the apex court held that the preamble to the constitution, fundamental rights, and directive principles — the trinity — were the conscience of the Constitution. Several such judgments have maintained that directive principles were fundamental in the governance of the country, and the State shall strive towards fulfilling obligations laid therein. How has the Supreme Court handled the issue of UCC? Starting with its judgment in Shah Bano Case in 1985, the top court has dwelt on the UCC in several of its judgments. In many of these, the court favoured a common law for all citizens and reminded the Parliament of the spirit of Article 44. But the Supreme Court also remained mindful of its boundaries under the Constitution when it refrained from issuing any positive directive to the government in this regard, underlining that law-making is the exclusive right of the Parliament. In Shah Bano case, the court had lamented: “It is a matter of regret that Article 44 has remained a dead letter... Common civil code will help the cause of national integration by removing desperate loyalties to laws, which have conflicting ideologies. No community is likely to bell the cat by making gratuitous concessions on this issue. It is for the State, which is charged with the duty of securing a uniform civil code and it has legislative competence to do so.” Again, in Sarla Mudgal Case (1995), which dealt with issue of bigamy and conflict between the personal laws existing on matters of marriage, the court highlighted the need for a UCC yet again. The court underlined that until UCC was enacted for all the citizens of the country, there will be always a loophole because different faiths had different beliefs, and naturally due to different beliefs and practices of communities, there will be a conflict. It also requested the Prime Minister of India to have a fresh look at Article 44 and endeavour to secure for the citizens a UCC throughout the territory of India and wanted the court to be informed about the steps taken. Also Read | SC notice renews debate over holy sites in Varanasi, MathuraHowever, the Supreme Court’s subsequent orders in Ahmedabad Women Action Group case (1997) and Lily Thomas case (2000) clarified that no direction was issued to the government for enactment of UCC in the Sarla Mudgal case. But in John Vallamattom Case (2003), the court said that a common civil code will “help the cause of national integration by removing all contradictions based on ideologies”. But 2015 witnessed the top court divided over the subject once again. In September-October 2015, the apex court revived the debate over the common law when it asked the Central government whether it was willing to bring UCC since there was, it said, “total confusion” over the incoherent stipulations about marriage, divorce, adoption, maintenance and inheritance among different religions. In December 2015, however, another bench in the Supreme Court turned down a PIL for a UCC, saying the apex court’s observations for enacting a common law could only be in the “realm of hope and expectations” but a mandamus (directive) could not be issued to the government. In 2019, the top court again expressed its disappointment over lack of UCC, saying: “Whereas the founders of the Constitution in Article 44 in Part IV dealing with the Directive Principles of State Policy had hoped and expected that the State shall endeavour to secure for the citizens a Uniform Civil Code throughout the territories of India, till date no action has been taken in this regard.” How has the BJP-led government dealt with UCC?The Bharatiya Janata Party considers the introduction of the UCC as a core ideological issue, and has, in the past, cited the example of Goa, which has a common law called the Goa Civil Code.Narendra Modi, in an interview to Urdu weekly Nai Duniya published in May 2014, had acknowledged that the Constitution said the government will make efforts to implement UCC while adding that a common law did not mean thrusting of Hindu code on all citizens. After coming to power, the Modi government did bring the debate to the fore. In a written reply to a question raised by Yogi Adityanath in Parliament in July 2014, Union law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad cited Article 44 of the Constitution and said that a wide consultation of stakeholders would be required for further steps in this regard. In June 2016, the ministry of law and justice, made a reference to the Law Commission to examine all matters relating to the implementation of the UCC. The Law Commission, however, did not submit a final report on the issue and furnished a consultation paper on “Reform of Family Law” in August 2018. Also Read | ‘Worrying that SC now has just one woman judge’: ChandrachudThis consultation paper stated that a Uniform Civil Code was “neither necessary nor desirable at this stage” and recommended that existing family laws across religions required to be amended and codified to tackle discrimination and inequality in personal laws. The consultation paper was one of the last reports submitted by the 21st Law Commission. How have the petitions in the Supreme Court renewed the debate on UCC? Beginning December 16, 2020, advocate Ashwini Upadhyay has succeeded in drawing the top court’s attention to as many as five petitions that pressed for uniformity in personal laws across various religions. The first two petitions to be admitted by the Supreme Court on December 16 last year related to uniform grounds of divorce and uniformity in providing maintenance and alimony. Upadhyay’s petitions argued that divorce, maintenance and alimony laws in certain religions discriminated and marginalised women. These anomalies, varying from one religion to another, were violative of the right to equality (Article 14 of the Constitution) and right against discrimination (Article 15) on the basis of religion and gender and right to dignity. On January 29, the top court also issued notice to the Central government on another PIL by Upadhyay, demanding uniform grounds of adoption and guardianship for all citizens throughout the country. His PIL complained that the current practice of adoption was blatantly discriminatory as Hindus have a codified law of adoption but Muslims, Christians, and Parsis did not have it. Upadhyay’s another PIL seeking uniformity in age of marriage was also entertained by the apex court on February 2. The court had issued notice on his request to transfer petitions demanding uniform minimum age of marriage for men and women pending in the high courts of Delhi and Rajasthan to the top court to avoid multiplicity of litigation and conflicting views. Pointing out that more than 125 countries have a uniform age of marriage for men and women, Upadhyay urged the top court to declare 21 years to be the minimum age for marriage in India. The latest one to be admitted by the Supreme Court pertains to uniform laws of succession and inheritance applicable across religious faiths. On March 10, the court issued notice to the Centre on another PIL by Upadhyay, who said uniform laws in succession and inheritance are necessary to secure justice, equality and dignity of women. This was the fifth PIL by Upadhyay entertained by the Supreme Court on uniform laws, and all these petitions have been clubbed together. While the Central government is still to make its stand clear on these issues, what cannot be doubted is that by entertaining as many as five petitions, the Supreme Court is set to rekindle a debate yet again on a Uniform Civil Code in India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/has-the-supreme-court-set-the-ball-rolling-for-a-uniform-civil-code-101615802810671.html
15-03-2021||India||Parliament session: Bill to amend juvenile justice law introduced in Lok Sabha||A bill to amend the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015, which seeks to increase the role of district magistrates and additional district magistrates, was introduced in the Lok Sabha on Monday.Congress MP Shashi Tharoor opposed the bill at the introduction stage but Women and Child Development minister Smriti Irani rejected the points raised by him.The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Amendment Bill, 2021 was later introduced by a voice vote.As per the Cabinet decision, in every district, the district magistrate and the additional district magistrate will get the power to monitor functions of agencies responsible for the implementation of the Act.The district child protection unit will also function under the district magistrate.According to amendments cleared by the Cabinet last month, before becoming a member of a child welfare committee, background and educational qualification checks will be included.The amendment to the bill intends to empower district magistrates and additional district magistrates to authorise orders of adoption, propose that appeals on the orders of adoption may be referred to the divisional commissioner, and to strengthen child welfare committees by incorporating provisions relating to educational qualifications for the members and stipulating eligibility conditions for selection of the committee.The bill seeks to categorise offences wherein the maximum sentence is more than seven years' imprisonment but no minimum sentence or a minimum sentence of less than seven years has been provided as "serious offences" under the Juvenile Justice Act, and to remove difficulties in interpretation of the Act."Serious offences" includes offences for which the punishment under the Indian Penal Code or any other law for the time being is imprisonment between three and seven years.The bill intends to ensure that the district magistrate is suitably placed to ensure effective coordination among the stakeholders for facilitation of necessary services for children's rehabilitation or re-integration.By further empowering district magistrates to deal with child protection and adoption processes, it aims to facilitate a coordinated and effective response of the administration to various issues pertaining to children, including adoption, the bill said.On the child welfare committee, the bill said no person shall be appointed as a member unless they have been actively involved in health, education or welfare activities pertaining to children for at least seven years or is a practicing professional with a degree in child psychology or psychiatry or law or social work or sociology or human development.The bill further proposes that the appointment of any member of the committee shall be terminated by the state government, after making an inquiry, if they fail to attend the proceedings of the committee consecutively for three months without any valid reason or if they fail to attend less than three-fourths of the sittings in a year.The bill makes the district magistrate the grievance redressal authority for the child welfare committee, and anyone connected with a child may file a petition before the official, who shall consider and pass appropriate orders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/parliament-session-bill-to-amend-juvenile-justice-law-introduced-in-lok-sabha-101615800222761.html
15-03-2021||India||Allow transpersons, amend National Cadet Corps Act: Kerala High Court||The Kerala High Court on Monday ruled that Hina Haneefa, a 23-year-old transgender person, should be enrolled in the National Cadet Corps (NCC). Hearing a petition filed by her, justice Anu Sivaraman observed that a transgender person is entitled to enrol in the NCC in accordance with her self-perceived gender equality.Delivering the judgment, the court directed the Union government to amend Section 6 of the National Cadet Corps Act (1948) which excludes transgender persons from joining the NCC.“I am the happiest person today. More than my personal victory, I opened the door for my community members. It is just the beginning. I hope eventually we can join the armed forces also,” said Haneefa, a first year degree student of the University College in Thiruvananthapuram. She moved the high court last year after authorities turned down her bid to join the NCC.In her plea, she contended that she had joined the NCC at the age of 13 when she was in the school. At that time she was enrolled as a boy cadet. Two years back, she had undergone gender affirmation sex transformation surgery and enrolled at the University College for the degree course. But when she tried to enrol in the NCC she was denied admission saying it was against the existing Act.The court held that she was entitled to enrolment in the senior girl’s division of the NCC and that the rejection of her request was unsustainable. It said NALSA judgment of 2014 and the Transgender Act of 2020 overrides the argument of the defence ministry that there were no provisions to enrol transgender persons.“What we need is acceptance, not sympathy. Though Kerala is the first state to come out with an exclusive transgender policy and transgender justice board, attitude of the society will have to change,” said Haneefa, adding her fight was not for her alone but for the entire community.She said employment and accommodation remain two major challenges to the community in the state and expressed confidence things will change.“It is a historic verdict. Equal opportunity is a constitutional right. This will open many eyes,” said Shyma S Praha, state transgender cell nodal officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/allow-transgenders-amend-national-cadet-corps-act-kerala-high-court-101615800294065.html

AT present, the price of crude oil is around USD 65 per barrel.On why the government was not bringing petroleum products under GST as promised by the then Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, Thakur said no state has so far given a proposal for the same."If any state feels that petroleum products should be brought under GST then the Centre has no objection in discussing about it," he said.Last month, Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman and RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das had said the Centre and the states should talk to each other and look for a "coordinated action" to reduce taxes on diesel and petrol.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-states-need-to-think-about-reducing-taxes-on-petrol-diesel-says-anurag-thakur-101615799742391.html

To that end, air transport bubble arrangements have been concluded with 27 countries so far."The Government is fully cognizant of the employment concerns that our people abroad have in the context of the Covid pandemic. Especially in the Gulf, there has been tremendous economic and social disruption that has impacted them. We have softened it somewhat but real challenges are there to be addressed. Let me assure the House that we take this as a priority," he said. The government has led the way for an economic recovery at home, and similar untiring efforts are being made to help renew livelihoods of Indians abroad, the minister said."The air travel arrangements are a necessary enabling measure. But beyond that, we have been active in urging our partner governments to look sympathetically at the employment of our citizens as they chart their own recovery pathway. The Gulf has been the focal point of our endeavours, though this is a global effort on our part," Jaishankar said.In recent months, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has engaged the leaders of Saudi Arabia, UAE, Qatar and Oman, while Jaishankar has travelled to UAE, Qatar, Bahrain and Oman to discuss the governments there the welfare of people there. "I have recently hosted the UAE Foreign Minister in India and expect to do so with that of Kuwait very soon," the minister said."From our recent interactions, we have reason to expect that partner governments in the Gulf would be helpful in facilitating the early return of many who were compelled to go back because of the pandemic," Jaishankar added.He said the support extended from India for the stay and travel of Indian citizens was warmly acknowledged by the community and the governments alike. The provision of medical supplies and food items from India as an exceptional gesture to the Gulf during this period clearly had powerful resonance. So did the arrival of health professionals and medical staff, especially the dedicated medical team India sent to Kuwait.The minister said ambassadors and senior officials have been in regular touch with most community organisations and get their feedback on both the health situation and economic recovery. "We are aware that there are problems of compensation, re-employment and re-skilling that need solutions. And these are today the core of our agenda with our partner governments."The welfare of students studying abroad has also been of particular concern and embassies across the world have been given instructions to reach out to them, monitor their situation and assist their return, where required, Jaishankar stressed.As with workers and professionals, the focus has now shifted to their going back to universities. Some countries have been more open in this regard than others, obviously reflecting their particular COVID challenge. This, therefore, remains a high priority and our endeavour will be to encourage an early return to normalcy, he added.Under air transport bubbles, which are temporary reciprocal arrangements for commercial passenger services until the resumption of regular international flights, the Air India group alone has operated more than 9,500 flights, taking 10.9 lakh passengers abroad so far. The largest numbers have gone to the Gulf."During the pandemic, our Prime Minister had declared that the Government would take care of both lives and livelihood. This guidance has been the basis for the activities of our diplomacy abroad," Jaishankar said.With regard to seafarers, he said the government has been working with shipping companies to ensure their well-being and where required, return to India. The challenges presented by crew change procedures were daunting but the flexibility shown by various stakeholders allowed us to overcome them."Members would also recall the predicament of two crews who were in particular difficulty outside Chinese ports. Their situation was also eventually resolved through great perseverance. We continue to interact with many governments to devise more friendly SOPs for crew change requirements," Jaishankar noted.He said serious problems were faced by fishermen who were working out of Iran. Some Gulf nations also witnessed this, perhaps to a lesser degree. The repatriation phase is over and the re-employment one has just started, Jaishankar added."I wish to assure this august House that in the days ahead, as our quest for normalcy progresses, as the global market place and work place resume activities, as centres of study reopen the doors, we will be there - to encourage, facilitate, secure and support," Jaishankar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/expect-govts-in-gulf-to-help-in-facilitating-early-return-of-indians-jaishankar-101615798063863.html

Both, Covishield (AstraZeneca/Oxford) and Covaxin (Bharat Biotech) are currently being administered in the country as part of the drive."Following a recent concern raised around thrombotic events, AstraZeneca would like to offer its reassurance on the safety of its Covid-19 vaccine based on clear scientific evidence. Safety is of paramount importance and the company is continually monitoring the safety of its vaccine," the drug major said in a statement on Monday.A careful review of all available safety data of more than 17 million people vaccinated in the European Union (EU) and the UK with Covid-19 vaccine AstraZeneca has shown no evidence of an increased risk of pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or thrombocytopenia, in any defined age group, gender, batch or in any particular country, it added.AstraZeneca noted that so far across the EU and the UK, there have been 15 events of DVT and 22 events of pulmonary embolism reported among those given the vaccine, based on the number of cases the company has received as of March 8."This is much lower than would be expected to occur naturally in a general population of this size and is similar across other licensed COVID-19 vaccines. The monthly safety report will be made public on the European Medicines Agency website in the following week, in line with exceptional transparency measures for Covid-19," it added.Furthermore, in clinical trials, even though the number of thrombotic events was small, these were lower in the vaccinated group, it said.There has also been no evidence of increased bleeding in over 60,000 participants enrolled, it added."The nature of the pandemic has led to increased attention in individual cases and we are going beyond the standard practices for safety monitoring of licensed medicines in reporting vaccine events, to ensure public safety.“In terms of quality, there are also no confirmed issues related to any batch of our vaccine used across Europe, or the rest of the world," AstraZeneca Chief Medical Officer Ann Taylor said.Additional testing has, and is, being conducted by the company and independently by European health authorities and none of these re-tests have shown cause for concern, she added.During the production of the vaccine more than 60 quality tests are conducted by the drug firm its partners and by more than 20 independent testing laboratories, Taylor noted."All tests need to meet stringent criteria for quality control and this data is submitted to regulators within each country or region for independent review before any batch can be released to countries," she added.The company is keeping this issue under close review but available evidence does not confirm that the vaccine is the cause, she noted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/astrazeneca-reassures-safety-of-covid-19-vaccine-101615798096939.html

15-03-2021||India||Kerala High Court allows transgender woman to join NCC, calls for changes in enrolment criteria||Kerala High Court on Monday allowed a transgender woman to seek admission into the National Cadet Corps, the youth wing of the Indian armed forces, saying the fact that the NCC act does not recognise the third gender cannot be a reasonable justification to deny entry to a trans person. This comes days after Hina Haneefa had moved a petition challenging a section of the NCC act that only allowed males and females to enrol with the cadet corps.The single bench of Justice Anu Sivaraman said the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act, 2019, recognises a transgender person's right to self-perceived gender identity. "In view of the specific provisions of the 2019 act, a transgender person has the right to be recognised not only as a transgender but also a right to self-perceived gender, i.e. the female gender," Sivaraman was quoted as saying by LiveLaw."The denial of enrolment is unsustainable. The petitioner will be entitled to participate in the selection process on the basis of her application. If she is successful, the petitioner will be enrolled in NCC Unit," Sivaraman was quoted as saying by LiveLaw.The court also directed the NCC to amend its enrolment criteria and allow the provision to include transgender persons as eligible for seeking admission in the cadet corps. Necessary changes to the enrolment criteria must be made within six months, the court held.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-hc-says-transwoman-entitled-to-enrol-in-ncc-101615790351281.html

15-03-2021||India||India to take up UK racism matters when required: Jaishankar||India will champion the fight against discrimination and will take up the matters of racism against Indian students with the UK, said the External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar in Rajya Sabha on Monday."We will raise it whenever required and we will always champion the fight against racism and other forms of intolerance," the Minister said.Jaishankar's response came after a question by an Odisha BJP MP Ashwini Vaishnaw, where he expressed "shared global concerns about racism". Vaishnaw stated that there "appears to be a continuation of attitudes and prejudices from the colonial area especially in the United Kingdom".The Odisha MP alleged that Rashmi Samant, a student from Karnataka and former president-elect of Oxford University Student Union, was "cyberbullied to the point that she had to resign (from the post)." "Even the Hindu religious beliefs of her parents were publicly attacked by a faculty member," he said."As land of Mahatma Gandhi, we can never ever turn our eyes away from racism wherever it is. Particularly so when it is in a country where we have such a large diaspora. As a friend of the UK, we also have concerns about its reputational impact," Jaishankar said while speaking in the Upper House."We have strong ties with the UK. We will take up such matters with great candour when required, he added assuring that New Delhi will monitor these developments "very very closely."Interestingly, the comments came days after India summoned British High Commissioner over an "unwarranted discussion" in the British Parliament on agricultural reforms in India.According to media reports, Samant was the first Indian woman to be elected as the president of the OUSU and was due to begin in June. She had won the election in February, winning 1,966 out of a possible 3,708 votes.She resigned days after surrounding some of her past remarks on social media.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-to-take-up-uk-racism-matters-when-required-jaishankar-101615793523799.html
15-03-2021||India||On Oxford University racism row, Jaishankar says ‘will raise it when required’||External affairs minister S Jaishankar said in Parliament on Monday India can 'never turn eyes away from racism' and will champion the fight against it after a BJP leader raised the issue of Rashmi Samant, the Indian student who resigned as the president of the Oxford University's students’ union last month after controversy over some of her socials media posts.“As the land of Mahatma Gandhi, we can never ever turn our eyes away from racism. Particularly so when it is in a country where we have such a large diaspora. We have strong ties with the UK. We will take up such matters with great candour when required,” Jaishankar said in the Rajya Sabha.“We will monitor these developments very very closely. We will raise it when required and we will always champion the fight against racism and other forms of intolerance,” the foreign minister said.The Bharatiya Janata Party leader Ashwini Vaishnaw slammed the “cyberbullying” Sawant faced. Vaishnaw also called out the “continuation of attitudes and prejudices from the colonial areas, especially in the UK.” “She overcame all the challenges to become the first Indian woman president of Oxford University student's union. What treatment was meted out to her? Shouldn't this diversity be celebrated? Instead, she was cyberbullied to the point that she had to resign,” he said.Samant, the first Indian woman to be elected president of the Oxford University Students Union, quit from her post days after her election in February. Her resignation came in the backdrop of some of her old social media posts that were deemed to be “racist” and “insensitive”.Her posts, mostly on Instagram, including one with a play on words about the Holocaust and a photo of her visit to Malaysia with the caption “Ching Chang,” were termed offensive by Jewish and Chinese students of the university. Another post in which she separated “women” and “transwomen” in the caption and her comparison of imperialist Cecil Rhodes to Adolf Hitler during a Student Union debate also upset her fellows.Samant apologised for the social media posts, some of which dated back to 2017, in an open letter. The Oxford University Chinese Society (OUCS) responded to Samant’s initial apology by saying: “Regrettably, we have not yet heard anything directly from Rashmi Samant. Her long-overdue public apology does not seem sincere to the OUCS. In her apology letter, Rashmi seems to be avoiding addressing her mistakes directly, and it does not show her taking responsibility for her insensitivity to race or ignorance towards the trans-community. We cannot see Rashmi as the SU president we ‘rightfully deserve’ or trustSamant later announced her resignation as the president-elect on Facebook as she continued to face criticism. “In light of the recent events surrounding my election to the Presidency of the Oxford SU, I believe it is best for me to step down from the role. It has been an honour to be your President-elect,” she wrote in the social media post.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/on-oxford-university-racism-row-jaishankar-says-will-raise-it-when-required-101615793199371.html

Built under visionary leadership of Hon.@PMOIndiait has emerged as an international tourist destination, offering multiple attractions for all age groups. @narendramodi @tourismgoi@souindia," Gupta tweeted.To improve rail and air connectivity to Kevadia, the government recently added eight new trains from different parts of the country and a seaplane service from Ahmedabad.The flow of visitors to the tourist spot was affected after the outbreak of Covid-19 in 2020, but picked up rapidly since it was reopened for the public on October 17 last year after remaining closed for over seven months.During his address on January18 this year after flagging off eight trains to Kevadia from across India, Prime Minister Modi said more tourists visit the Statue of Unity in Gujarat than the Statue of Liberty in the US.He had said that with increased connectivity, over a lakh people will visit Kevadia daily, as per a survey.On Patel's birth anniversary last year, Modi had also launched a seaplane service between the Statue of Unity and the Sabarmati river in Ahmedabad, further improving connectivity to the tourist attraction in Kevadia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gujarat-statue-of-unity-crosses-50-lakh-visitorsmark-101615791024236.html

He also told us that he will adjourn the House quickly so that the MPs can go back to their states for poll campaign,” said senior Trinamool leader Saugata Ray.The Opposition disrupted both Houses of Parliament for three consecutive days over fuel price hikes and three contentious farm laws before proceedings were adjourned till Monday.

He was 105.Active till his end, his portrayal of Lord Parasuram on stage when he completed 100 years in Kozhikode town hall enthralled art lovers of the state. His Krishna and Kuchela characters were favourites of classical dance connoisseurs. He was conferred Padma Shri in 2017 in recognition of his contributions to Kathakali.He could not study beyond the primary level and was more drawn to the classical dance form. Leaving his home at the age of 14, he became a disciple of famous Kathakali maestro Guru Karunakara Menon. In 1944 he established the first classical dance school in Kannur, Bharatiya Nritya Kalalayam.Later he set up an exclusive school for Kathakali at his native place and dedicated his life to his art. He developed his own improvisations and charmed the audience with his mudras, grace and innumerable disciples. He was in the news recently after he received Covid-19 vaccine at a private hospital in Kozhikode. Governor Arif Mohammad Khan and chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan have condoled the death of the maestro.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kathakali-maestro-guru-chemancheri-dies-at-105-101615790209850.html
15-03-2021||India||Cabinet meetings continue to be held online: Here’s why||When the Union cabinet met on March 10, the meeting didn’t last for more than 15 minutes. There was just one agenda, creation of the Pradhan Mantri Swasthya Suraksha Nidhi as a single non-lapsable reserve fund, and the meeting was held online. The Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led cabinet, the highest executive body of the country, has switched to a digital mode for the past many months after the Covid-19 pandemic plagued India last year, according to officials involved in the meetings. Public health safety protocols were overhauled in 2020 as Covid-19 played havoc with human lives, livelihoods and the economy. The government imposed federal lockdown, shut down many public services and offices were closed in an effort to contain the virus in the country of 1.3 billion people. As millions of Indians clung to the internet more than ever to earn livelihoods, hundreds of public offices too, went online, discarding the age-old style of functioning. The Union cabinet, that meets every week on Wednesday, switched to a never-before digital avatar to get the government of India’s mammoth machinery going. Also Read | Cabinet clears changes to Juvenile Justice ActAnd now, even as both Houses of Parliament have partially relaxed social distancing norms and held two sessions in physical form, political parties are frequently going into a huddle to strategise for the coming polls, and government offices have usual attendance, the cabinet continues to remain online. “Yes, the cabinet meetings continue to be held online,” said a top government official who attends all such meetings. These top-secret meetings are held on a secured platform developed by NIC, the government’s IT arm that has also devised the platform for online movement of files. “The same platform had been used for the PM’s Pragati meetings with bureaucrats,” said a third official. The ministers are free to log on from their offices or residences using passwords or biometric impressions. “But they are expected to remain in Delhi when the cabinet meetings take place,” said a senior aide of a minister of a social sector. There are a few reasons, one of the officials mentioned above said, for the digital cabinet meetings. “It becomes far more easier for all ministers to meet online as most of them are extremely busy in their constituencies or states.” Another official said, accommodating all 21 ministers while maintaining the required 6-ft social distancing norm between two chairs in the cabinet room is a major challenge. While no PMO officials tested positive for Covid-19 in this entire period, there was one instance when some of the NIC officials in the PMO tested positive and in that week, no online meetings could be held. To be sure, the Union cabinet held physical meetings on a few occasions last year at the 7, Lok Kalyan Marg. The huge centre table was removed from the designated cabinet room, to ensure social distancing. The PM sat at one end and ministers’ chairs were laid out in four rows in front. “There were two separate doors—one for the ministers and the other exclusively for the PM—in the room to adhere to health norms,” said a second official. But the PMO decided to stick to the digital format as it was convenient for all ministers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cabinet-meetings-continue-to-be-held-online-here-s-why-101615789789882.html

15-03-2021||India||Covid-19: Feluda test kit tweaked to detect mutated variants quickly||Researchers from the Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology, New Delhi, have modified their gene-editing technology-based Feluda paper-strip diagnostic kit in such a manner that a simple polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test can be used to detect mutated variants of the Sars-CoV-2 virus that causes coronavirus disease (Covid-19), said the institute.After naming their first kit after the famous fictional Bengali detective, the researchers have named the second one Ray (Rapid variant AssaY) after the author of the detective series, Satyajit Ray.At present, to detect the UK, South Africa, or Brazilian variants, the entire virus genome has to be sequenced to look for specific mutations. This, however, adds cost and time to the process -- three days in comparison to a few hours it takes to do a PCR.Also Read | India records 26,291 Covid-19 cases, 118 deaths; active cases spike by 8,718“We have developed the Feluda platform to come up with a test that can tell us in a few hours whether an infected person has any of the three new variants of concern. This will make detecting the new variants simpler and eliminate the need for complete genetic sequencing for diagnosis, which raises the cost manifold and takes about three days,” said Dr Debojyoti Chakraborty, senior scientist at IGIB and part of the team that developed both the tests.He added, “This does not mean we can stop sequencing the viral genome. We will still have to sequence a proportion of our positive samples to detect whether new mutations are arising or any imported mutations are in circulation. Used along with the Feluda strip, this test will just help in diagnosing whether a particular person has the mutated variant or not.”Once a swab sample from the patient is collected, the viral RNA is extracted from it and amplified using a thermo-cycler machine. The Feluda (FnCas9 Editor Linked Uniform Detection Assay) test then uses a paper strip barcoded with the Cas9 protein to recognise specific portions of the genetic material of the Sars-CoV-2 virus to give a positive result.For Ray, the scientists have encoded the Cas9 protein to recognise the N501Y mutation, which is present in all the three new variants of concern. “In theory, the Cas9 protein can be encoded to recognise any number of mutations as and when they arise. The high specificity of the Cas9 can be utilised to detect any point mismatch in the viral genome,” said Dr Chakraborty.The lab is currently in talks with the industry to market the product. Tata Sons had manufactured and marketed the initial Feluda test kits. The cost of the Ray test is likely to be the same as Feluda. The scientists had earlier said that the lab cost of the test came up to ₹500 per sample, but the final cost decision depends on the company marketing it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-feluda-test-tweaked-to-detect-mutated-variants-quickly-101615786849910.html

The day was inspired by President John F Kennedy’s special message to the US Congress on March 15, 1962. Kennedy addressed the issue of consumer rights and laid emphasis on its importance and became the first world leader to talk about consumer rights. On this day every year, various organisations like Consumer International hold events and campaigns to inform more and more people about consumer rights.World Consumer Rights Day 2021 themeThe theme of the World Consumer Rights Day 2021 is ‘Tackle plastic pollution’. “Plastic pollution is one of the most pressing issues facing our planet. Consumer awareness of the plastics crisis is growing around the world. Consumers have a critical role in shaping the marketplace, and we must support them to mobilise businesses and governments, to ensure sustainable consumption is accessible to all,” Helena Leurent, director general of Consumers International, said in a message on World Consumer Rights Day.To highlight the importance of controlling the use of plastics, Consumers International gathered photos from across the world to show how the 7 'R's of replace, rethink, refuse, reduce, reuse, recycle, and repair play an important role in the world’s fight against plastic pollution.Consumer rights in IndiaIn India, the consumer rights movement finds its roots in 1966 in Maharashtra. After the Grahak Panchayat was established in Pune in 1974, several institutions for the welfare of consumers were formed in many states. On December 9, 1986, the consumer protection act was passed in Parliament with the purpose of empowering consumers. The act focuses on the establishment of consumer councils, forums and appellate courts for the settlement of consumer's grievances.The act provides consumers with the following rights:1. Right to be heard at an appropriate forum2. Right to seek redressal in case of unfair trade practices3. Right to consumer education4. Right to goods and services at competitive prices5. Right to be informed about the quality, potency, purity, standard and price of goods and services6. Right to be protected against wrong marketing of goods and services which are hazardous to the life and property||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/world-consumer-rights-day-2021-all-you-need-to-know-101615785268695.html
15-03-2021||India||US defence secretary Lloyd Austin’s India visit reflection of significant bilateral ties: Envoy||Ahead of US defence secretary Lloyd Austin’s visit to India this week, the Indian ambassador to the United States TS Sandhu said his trip, the first by a senior cabinet minister under Joe Biden’s presidency, hints at the significance of the ties between the two countries. “This visit is a reflection of the importance which the US accords to India and the importance of our bilateral relationship,” he told news agency ANI.During his three-day India trip starting March 19, Austin will hold talks with defence minister Rajnath Singh and other senior government officials. Austin will “discuss deepening the US-India Major Defense Partnership and advancing cooperation between our countries for a free, prosperous, and open Indo-Pacific and Western Indian Ocean Region,” according to the defence department.Austin will reach India next week after visiting Japan and South Korea. His first trip overseas after taking office to the Indo-Pacific points to the importance the Biden administration is according to the region. He began the tour on March 13 with a visit to the US Indo-Pacific command headquarters in Hawaii. Last Saturday, Austin said he was travelling to Asia to boost military cooperation with American allies and foster “credible deterrence” against China.Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Australia’s Prime Minister Scott Morrison, Japan’s Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga and Biden met virtually during the Quad summit on Friday.During the virtual summit, the four leaders pledged to hold an in-person meet by the end of this year. “The desire was to have an in-person summit but due to the pandemic, it wasn't possible. You have seen in the joint statement, there's a clear indication that foreign ministers will meet, and by the year end, all four leaders have pledged to have an in-person summit,” Sandhu told ANI.The Quad leaders launched an initiative under which India will produce up to one billion doses of Covid-19 vaccines by 2022, which will be funded by the US and Japan, to carry out last-mile distribution by Australia in the South-East Asian nations of the Indo-Pacific.Speaking about the success of the event, Sandhu said, “You have to just see public viewing of the first 5 minutes and I think you can see. The general atmosphere was very good amongst all leaders.” The envoy, according to ANI, also hailed the bilateral ties between India and the US, saying the relationship is much deeper, which very much reflected in the equation between PM Modi and President Biden during the summit.The envoy also spoke about the relationship that Modi and Biden have shared in the past years. “You will recall in 2014 and 2016, the equation between PM Modi and the then VP Biden was extremely good. Not only at the lunch he hosted in 2014 but also in the 2016 session of Congress where the then vice president Biden presided,” he told ANI.In the joint statement, the four leaders have termed the Quad as a “flexible group of like-minded partners dedicated to advancing a common vision and to ensuring peace and prosperity,” adding that they were a group of democratic nations dedicated to delivering results through practical cooperation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/us-defence-secretary-lloyd-austin-s-india-visit-reflection-of-significant-bilateral-ties-envoy-101615784275251.html

15-03-2021||India||'Big threat': Rahul Gandhi warns citizens over India's rising Covid-19 cases||As India continued to record a surge in the daily cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Monday tweeted another reminder to citizens asking them to remain vigilant. The Congress leader also attached a graph, which showed that the weekly Covid-19 cases have increased by 33% in the country in a sharp surge since July last year. The graph shared by Gandhi showed that the rise in India's Covid-19 cases in the last week at 155,909 was the highest in 12 weeks."As warned earlier, #Covid19 continues to be a big threat. Please keep the guards up- wear masks and follow all precautions," Gandhi said in a tweet.His appeal came on a day the country reported this year's highest single-day spike of 26,291 Covid-19 cases. India's disease tally is now over 11.38 million and its death toll stands at 158,725.The opposition leader has constantly shared warnings and statistics on the Covid-19 disease outbreak in the country, asking citizens not to lower the guard against the viral contagion. In February this year, Gandhi accused the Centre of being "grossly" negligent and overconfident about the handling of the coronavirus pandemic, saying it was not over yet. His comments came after South African and Brazilian variants of the pathogen were detected in India. "GOI is being grossly negligent and over confident about Covid-19. It's not over yet," Gandhi tweeted.In July last year, when India was still coming to terms with the rising trajectory in cases amid scaling up of efforts by authorities to ramp up public health systems, the Congress leader had warned India would record two million cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) by the second week of August, a day after the country reported a million infections.“10,00,000 figures exceeded. If #COVID19 spreads at the same speed, more than 20,00,000 will be infected in the country by August 10,” Gandhi tweeted. “The government must take concrete, planned steps to stop the epidemic,” he added.He backed his warning by citing a news report quoting the World Health Organization (WHO) chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who had said that if concrete steps were not taken, the coronavirus pandemic would turn from bad to worse and that “there will be no return to the old normal for the foreseeable future.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/big-threat-rahul-gandhi-warns-citizens-over-india-s-rising-covid-19-cases-101615782053239.html
15-03-2021||India||Ambani security scare: Terrorist Tehseen Akhtar to be questioned in Tihar today||A team of officers from the Delhi police’s special cell will visit Tihar jail on Monday and question Indian Mujahideen (IM) terrorist Tehseen Akhtar on his role in the case of the explosives-laden vehicle outside industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s house, Antilia, in Mumbai on February 25. On Saturday, police questioned Akhtar, a former chief of the banned terror group, for nearly seven hours. Delhi Police officers, who did not wish to be named, said Akhtar was evasive and tried to mislead them during the questioning.Last week, while probing the case of an explosive-laden car found outside Ambani’s, central intelligences had discovered a chat on phone application Telegram, through which a terror group that called themselves Jaish-ul-Hind had claimed responsibility for the incident. The Telegram group was found to have been created inside Tihar jail, after which Delhi Police were informed. They, in turn, informed the prison department. On Thursday, the Tihar prison authorities conducted a raid inside jail 8 and seized two phones from Akhtar. Akhtar was convicted in the 2013 Hyderabad blasts case and has also been named in the 2011 Mumbai blasts, and 2010 Varanasi blasts, among other cases. Also Read | Tihar has no jammers that can block 4G signalsA senior police officer, who did not wish to be named, said, “ We are looking at the role of other inmates too. Akhtar was a top leader of the IM when he was arrested from Darjeeling, West Bengal, in March 2014. Inside jail number 8 of the high security ward, he shares space with at least four others booked in terror cases. Two are of the same IM group, while the other two are from the Indian module of the Al Qaeda. It is possible that others too were using the cell phone.”Later in the day on Monday, Delhi lieutenant governor Anil Baijal is scheduled to hold a meeting with Tihar prison’s director general, Sandeep Goel, and Delhi home secretary Bhupinder Bhalla over the issue of jammers and prisoners using cell phone inside the jail. Delhi police commissioner SN Shrivastava is also likely to be in the meeting. The Delhi government has already ordered an inquiry to probe how a prisoner accused of terror activities managed to get himself two cell phones in prison.On Monday, as part of the investigation, Delhi Police will question Akhtar on the genesis of the little-known group Jaish-ul-Hind. The group had claimed responsibility for the January 29 low-intensity blast outside the Israel embassy in Delhi. Police suspect that Jaish-ul- Hind is a new group started by absconding IM leaders. While many key members of the group, such as Akhtar(he was the head of the Ranchi module ) or IM’s co-founder Yasin Bhatkal, have been convicted and are currently behind bars, other top operatives such as Riyaz Bhatkal, Iqbal Bhatkal, Amir Raza Khan and Mohsin Chaudhary are absconding and are suspected to be in Pakistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ambani-security-scare-terrorist-tehseen-akhtar-to-be-questioned-in-tihar-today-101615783609719.html

Please watch it and avoid getting trapped by frauds," Srivastava said in a tweet.Citing the example of OLX website, which has seen a spike in cybercrime and frauds in the last few years, the police commissioner said that people use the platform to sell old furniture and the video alerts the users about a common fraud.Here are the steps listed out by the Delhi Police video on OLX QR code frauds:1. Victim lists a product (old furniture, refrigerator, air conditioner etc) for sale on OLX, Facebook Market place, Just Dial in a bid to find a buyer.2. Fraudsters posing as buyer contacts the owner of the item over phone and offers to pay in advance.3. To initiate the process of duping and conning the buyer, the fraudster further shares fake ID cards.4. In some cases, the fraudsters have also impersonated army personnel.5. In their final stage of fraud, the criminals share QR code over WhatsApp asking the victim to scan it to receive the payment.6. Following this, the victim scans QR code on his wallet apps such as PayTM, UPI and other payment platforms.7. Once the QR code is scanned, money gets debited instead of being credited.Senior officials of Delhi Police’s Cyber Cell said the number of cybercrime cases reported in the national capital spiked during last year's lockdown period, from nearly 2,000 in March to over 4,000 in May, as fraudsters adopted new methods to cheat people. "QR code cheating through Olx app became famous. Accused posed as customers and sent QR codes which when used would deduct money from victim's account," Prem Nath, joint commissioner of police (Cyber Cell), said in February.Cybercriminals, police said, have adopted a new modus operandi as fraudsters target people by creating fake government websites offering financial assistance, subsidies and government jobs. In other methods, the police have found extortion of money using edited porn videos, customer care, online search manipulation, phishing links in the name of schemes, and news and alert pushed through emails and WhatsApp.According to data shared by the Delhi Police, 62% of the cybercrime reported in the Capital were related to online financial fraud, 24% were related to social media and 14% to other cybercrime.The QR code method of fraud is on the rise as several parts of the country have witnessed this form of duping in the recent past. The Jammu and Kashmir police last week arrested two people from Rajasthan who extorted ₹1 lakh on the pretext of buying an old refrigerator, for which a seller had advertised on OLX. "The fraudsters convinced the complainant to scan a 'QR code' sent through mobile to receive money to buy the refrigerator but eventually managed to debit ₹1 lakh from his SBI bank account in five transactions,” a police official told PTI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-police-warn-olx-users-on-qr-code-frauds-here-s-how-you-can-avoid-losing-money-101615771153492.html

Nobody was injured in the incident. Manipur police arrested three persons in the case – Lisham Iboshana Meitei alias Jojo, Konsam Manithoi Singh and Huidrom Sangba, all having links with the banned outfit UNLF.Also Read | MHA tells 4 N-E states to prevent influx of people from MyanmarThe central intelligence agencies believe that the attack was planned in Myanmar after which the cadres were activated here in Imphal.NIA officials familiar with the case said they will take custody of the three arrested UNLF members and ask them about those who gave them directions for the attack.Even as Indian government is holding peace talks with most of the insurgent groups from the north-east, several commanders of outfits like UNLF have been hiding in Myanmar. UNLF chairperson Rajkumar Meghen was released from Guwahati Central Jail in November 2019 after serving a decade-long sentence.The central anti-terror probe agency has investigated several cases related to north-east insurgent groups in the last 11 years and has secured conviction against several ultras.As reported by HT on March 2, insurgency-related incidents in the northeastern (N-E) states have dipped by 80% and civilian deaths by 99% in 2020 compared to 2014, according to MHA data. The deaths of security forces’ personnel also came down by 75%.Several officials and experts said that fewer insurgency-related incidents in the N-E was due to majority of insurgent groups, including the National Socialist Council of Nagaland (NSCN) and its factions, having signed ceasefire agreements with the government. They added that regional diplomatic cooperation between India and neighbouring countries, including Bangladesh, Bhutan and Myanmar, have denied insurgents safe havens. Also, economic development in the region and movement of people to the mainland for job opportunities has resulted in the dip in violence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/unlf-from-myanmar-ordered-grenade-attack-on-manipur-guv-house-nia-to-probe-101615779169490.html

15-03-2021||India||No child’s play: Toy guns turn real threat||What is a common link connecting a nearly successful 30-minute bank robbery, a phone snatching near a Metro station, extortion by a man posing as a police officer, and a fake heist at a jewellery showroom orchestrated by its owner?All the four crimes, officers investigating the cases in the last two years found, had the suspects using toy guns.As odd as it may sound, toy guns are not uncommon “weapons” in the hands of criminals in Delhi. Over the last two years, there have been at least 14 recorded instances of dummy firearms being used in crimes, ranging from bank robberies to street crimes, such as snatching, and extortion to fake robberies.In fact, two of the last four bank robberies in the national capital involved toy guns – in one instance it served as the lone weapon, and in the other as a back-up weapon.And this year, in a span of three days in January, there were three separate toy guns seized by the Delhi Police. In one of those cases, it was used for extortion by a club singer posing as a crime branch inspector and using the fake gun to extort people not wearing masks in Govindpuri. In another, a dummy gun was used to rob a mobile phone from a cab driver near the busy Jamia Nagar Metro station.In none of the 14 known instances, did the victims suspect that they were being threatened with a fake gun.When a mobile phone trader, who lost money in gambling, decided to target a bank in outer Delhi’s Prashant Vihar in March 2019, the only weapon he took with him was an air pistol — that is usually used to shoot balloons. Yet, operating alone, he was able to hold a dozen staff hostage for good 30 minutes and collect ₹40 lakh in cash, until the bank manager decided to challenge him and tackle him down.Till the time he was brought down, everyone in the bank believed he was wielding a real gun. In fact, the bank manager on duly even submitted the robbed cash and the gun to the police believing it was a real weapon. It was only when the police were examining the weapon, that they noticed it was a dummy weapon.Then in September, the same year, two men barged into a bank in east Delhi’s Farsh Bazar and briefly made away with nearly ₹9 lakh in cash. Police said that of the two weapons they brought along, one was a toy gun that looked real.While the toy guns in none of these 14 instances aroused suspicion, an incident in which a woman mocked some robbers for threatening her with “toy guns” took a tragic turn. In the robbery that took place in New Friends Colony, the robbers shot her in her foot to prove that they were carrying real weapons.Experts say that a host of reasons prompts criminals to opt for toy guns. Prakash Singh, former Uttar Pradesh Police chief, says that toy weapons are able to inspire the same kind of fear in victims that real guns do. Sometimes, a toy gun is used as a back-up of a real firearm as it comes at only a fraction of a cost of the genuine weapon.“A criminal knows that with a toy gun, he won’t be able to kill someone, even if the situation turns ugly. Moreover, he won’t be tried under the Arms Act,” says Singh.The Delhi Police does not maintain data on the use of toy guns in crimes, or the seizure of such “weapons”.When it comes to real guns, there were at least 672 cases last year when firearms were used in Delhi. The police went on to recover 2,735 illegal guns through last year.RP Meena, deputy commissioner of police (south-east Delhi), says that the offence cannot be deemed non serious just cause a toy gun was used in it.“We do not apply the Arms Act, but it is still a robbery, and the charges stand the scrutiny of the court,” says Meena, whose team recovered two of the last three toy guns in Delhi.But Prakash Singh believes that the use of toy guns falls in a grey area. “It is less serious than using of a real gun, but more serious than snatching without the use of a weapon,” he says.While these dummy guns maybe not capable of causing deaths, they are not entirely harmless either. Four years ago, a boy in Shahdara lost his left eye after being hit by a pellet fired from a toy gun being wielded by his neighbour.Meena says that these dummy guns are found in normal toy shops, online shopping platforms, sold as Diwali crackers and even in the form of cigarette lighters. “They look as good as real. And there is no ban on them,” says Meena. If convicted for a robbery using even a toy gun, the punishment remains imprisonment for up to 10 years.Delhi Police spokesperson, Chinmoy Biswal, attributes the use of toy guns by some criminals to the “difficulty” in procuring a real gun.“It is not so easy for criminals in Delhi to obtain a real gun. The non-habitual criminals may find it easier to use a toy gun rather than find a real gun,” says Biswal.“We ensure that using a toy gun doesn’t reduce the gravity of the crime in court,” Biswal adds.The toy guns, sometimes, even catches the police by surprise. A vehicle thief, when surrounded by the police in Shahdara, chose to attack them with an iron rod, despite possessing a pistol.The mystery was solved only when the suspect was overpowered. An examination of the gun revealed it was only a toy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-child-s-play-toy-guns-turn-real-threat-101615761182840.html
15-03-2021||India||NGO helps those living in homeless shelters in capital register for vaccine jabs||A Delhi-based NGO is helping vaccinate people living in government-run shelters against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19).The Centre for Holistic Development (CHD) is registering eligible people on the CoWin government portal.Sunil Aledia, CHD executive director, said, “There are a lot of people in shelters who meet the criteria, either above the age of 60 or at least 45-years-old with co-morbidities but have been left out of the drive unintentionally.”“We will be taking them for vaccination on March 16. We are hoping to register 100-150 people from across the city. We have also discussed this with district administrations and the Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board (which runs the shelters) to find a way to get homeless people vaccinated,” said Aledia.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageThere are close to 200 government-run shelter homes, which are under DUSIB and managed by various NGOs.Indu Prakash, a member of the Supreme Court-appointed monitoring committee for homeless shelters in Delhi, said, “The government should have a special drive to get the homeless, including those not living in shelters, vaccinated. While most may have ID cards, several may not and some measure should be devised to inoculate them too.”A senior DUSIB official said, “We are working on a plan to get these people vaccinated. So far, no decision has been taken.”Those running the shelter homes said that while identifying vulnerable people as per the criteria is not difficult, the real challenge is to take them to the vaccination centres. “A lot of us don’t have the resources to take these people to the inoculation centre. Also, some of the people, especially those who above 45 years of age, have to be examined by a doctor for comorbidities before they can be registered for vaccination. There is a need to arrange a medical screening of these people,” said Rajesh Kumar, national executive director of Society for Promotion of Youth and Masses (SPYM).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ngo-helps-those-living-in-homeless-shelters-in-capital-register-for-vaccine-jabs-101615756170424.html
15-03-2021||India||Covid-19: Door-to-door drive to boost shots turnout||With Covid-19 vaccination turnouts in the city consistently below the government’s expectations, district teams have fanned out across the Capital in a bid to convince people aged above 60 and those over 45 with serious illness to get inoculated against the infection, which has steadily inched up in the city over the past few days.A senior government official said the teams have also been entrusted with helping people register and book vaccine slots through the Centre’s CoWin system and arrange conveyance for them if required.“We want to scale up the vaccination drive by increasing capacity as well as turnout. This cohort mobilisation exercise is an important step in that direction. We have to ensure that a large number of people are protected against the disease at the earliest,” said Vijay Dev, Delhi’s chief secretary.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageSince January 16, when the vaccination drive was rolled out across the country starting with health care workers, 664,620 people in Delhi — roughly 3.3% of its total population — have received the first dose of the vaccine. These include 173,408 health workers, 264,282 front line workers, 196,007 people aged over 60 years and 30,923 people between ages 45-59 who have comorbidities, government records showed.Of 900,000 health workers and frontline workers in the city, around 600,000 registered for the vaccine. Delhi has around 2.1 million individuals aged over 60, according to election data which the government has used to record jab estimates. There is no clear estimate of people aged between 45-59 who have specific comorbidities as listed by the Union health ministry.“We are using booth-level machinery to reach out door-to-door, meet eligible beneficiaries and speak to them about the benefits of the vaccine, help reduce hesitance and assist them with the registration process,” said Arun Kumar Mishra, district magistrate (East Delhi).Delhi currently has 438 vaccine sites across 192 health care facilities. Of these, 56 are government facilities, where the vaccines are administered for free and 136 are private that charge up to ₹250 for a single dose.“The focus of the drive is on potential beneficiaries who live in slums and low-income group colonies, where people are generally less aware about the programme. Many are too poor to afford travel or are less comfortable with technology to register themselves on CoWin. Another focus group is elderly people who have no relatives,” said Dharmendra Kumar, additional district magistrate (west Delhi).Each district has between 25 and 50 teams depending on its size and population.The government’s initiative comes amid a nationwide resurgence of infections. The seven-day average of new Covid-19 cases across India has risen by 67% from lows seen after the end of the first wave of the pandemic (from 10,988 cases a day week ending February 11, to 18,371 cases a day for week ending March 12).Dr Suneela Garg, director professor of community medicines department, Maulana Azad Medical College in Delhi and member of the Lancet Covid-19 commission and vaccination taskforce for India, said: “Door-to-door drives are crucial to speed up the vaccination drive and ensure more people are protected against the disease at the earliest, especially in the light of uptick in cases in some states.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-door-to-door-drive-to-boost-shots-turnout-101615755704034.html
15-03-2021||India||Lloyd Austin's Asia trip to foster ‘deterrence against China’||US defence secretary Lloyd Austin said on Saturday he was travelling to Asia – including India, Japan and South Korea — to boost military cooperation with American allies and foster “credible deterrence” against China.At the three-day trip — the first visit to India by a senior member of the Joe Biden administration — Austin will hold talks with defence minister Rajnath Singh and other senior government officials. Military-to-military cooperation, defence trade, the Indo-Pacific region and the situation in Afghanistan are expected to be on the agenda during Austin’s visit to India from March 19-21.“This is all about alliances and partnerships,” Austin told reporters, kicking of the Asia visit from Hawaii, seat of the American military command for the Indo-Pacific region.“It’s also about enhancing capabilities,” he added, recalling that while the US was focused on the anti-jihadist struggle in the Middle East, China was modernising its army at a high speed.“Our goal is to make sure that we have the capabilities and the operational plans... to be able to offer a credible deterrence to China or anybody else who would want to take on the US,” he added.This tour in Asia of the heads of diplomacy and defence of the US follows an unprecedented summit of the Quad grouping — an informal alliance of India, Australia, Japan and the US born in the 2000s to counterbalance a rising China.The maiden Quad Summit convened by US President Joe Biden and joined by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison and Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga on Friday too reviewed common challenges across the Indo-Pacific, especially China’s assertive actions.The Biden administration has generally backed the tougher approach to China initiated by former president Donald Trump, but has also insisted that it can be more effective by shoring up alliances and seeking narrow ways to cooperate on priorities such as climate crisis.In his first months in office, Biden has several times signalled his desire to return the Asia-Pacific to the top of the US foreign policy agenda.In keeping with his broader “America is back” diplomatic theme, the US’s national security strategy pledged to reaffirms ties with traditional allies and said the country will maintain a “more robust” military presence in the Indo-Pacific region.The report released earlier this month noted that the US recognises the “deepest connection” with Indo-Pacific region, and will “deepen our partnership with India” along with other countries.Lloyd will be joined in Tokyo and Seoul by secretary of state Antony Blinken. “One of the things that the secretary of state and I want to do is begin to strengthen those alliances,” he said. “This will be more about listening and learning, getting their point of view.”Blinken will join President Joe Biden’s national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, in Anchorage on March 18 with their Chinese counterparts Wang Yi and Yang Jiechi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lloyd-austin-s-asia-trip-to-foster-deterrence-against-china-101615752919454.html
15-03-2021||India||Vaze in NIA custody till Mar 25; focus on 2nd car||A special court on Sunday remanded assistant police inspector Sachin Vaze to the National Investigation Agency’s custody till March 25 after the central agency arrested him late on Saturday for his alleged role in planting explosives in a vehicle found parked outside billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s house on February 25.Vaze was summoned at the agency’s Mumbai office at Cumballa Hill in south Mumbai around 11:30am on Saturday to record his statement after 20 unassembled gelatin sticks were discovered along with a threat letter in a Scorpio parked outside Ambani’s residence. He was arrested at 11:50pm the same day after an official said he confessed to his involvement in planting the car.On Sunday, NIA seized a white Innova car used by officers of the crime intelligence unit (CIU), which was headed by Vaze before he was moved out pending investigations. An official aware of the developments said the car appeared to be the same Innova that tailed the Scorpio on the night it was parked on Carmichael Road at a spot across the street from Ambani’s residence. CCTV footage from a nearby departmental store showed that an Innova remained parked behind the Scorpio for a few hours and then left, bearing the Scorpio driver.Vaze’s lawyers denied NIA’s claims and his alleged admission to his role in parking the explosives-laden car outside Ambani’s residence, Antilia. Vaze moved the Bombay high court challenging the grounds of his arrest, and the special NIA court will take up the matter on Monday after the prosecution refused to give Vaze a copy of his remand application citing privilege and confidentiality.Vaze’s advocate Sudeep Pasbola told news agency PTI that the arrest has been made only on the basis of suspicion and that there was no concrete evidence against him.After questioning him for several hours on Saturday, NIA arrested Vaze under sections 286 (negligent conduct with respect to explosive substance), 465 (punishment for forgery), 473 (making or possessing counterfeit seal), 506(2) (criminal intimidation, if threat be to cause death or grievous hurt), 120(B) (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code and section 4(a)(b) (1) (punishment for attempt to cause explosion, or for making or keeping explosive with intent to endanger life or property) of the Indian Explosives Act, 1908.According to a top NIA official who did not wish to be named, Vaze confessed to being part of a group that placed 20 loose gelatin sticks (unassembled, without a detonator or a timer) in a green-coloured Scorpio that was found parked outside Antilia.NIA, while seeking Vaze’s custody for 14 days, told the court that it received inputs about his role in placing gelatin sticks in the SUV and that when he was questioned about it, he admitted his involvement.Vaze, who was part of the Crime Intelligence Unit of the Crime Branch, was one of the lead investigators of the case before it was transferred to the Maharashtra Anti Terrorism Squad.The developments linked to Vaze have triggered a political slugfest in Maharashtra, with the state Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) president Chandrakant Patil on Sunday holding chief minister Uddhav Thackeray responsible for the entire episode. The Shiv Sena has denied allegations made by the opposition.NIA further submitted that the investigation being conducted by Vaze was flawed. In its remand plea, NIA submitted witnesses’ statements to show Vaze’s alleged involvement in the case. The central agency also told the court that his custodial interrogation was required to unearth the conspiracy and gather evidence.NIA is also scrutinising the mobile call data records of Vaze and other people close to him in the police department and outside, another official said. “The NIA has also been interrogating another officer, API Riyaz Kazi, and a police constable from CIU who were allegedly close to Vaze,” the NIA official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.Vaze is also under investigation for his alleged role in the suspicious death of 48-year-old Mansukh Hiran, a Thane-based auto spare parts businessman who was linked to the Scorpio found parked outside the Ambani residence in South Mumbai. The case is being probed by the ATS.(Inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vaze-in-nia-custody-till-mar-25-focus-on-2nd-car-101615752271258.html
15-03-2021||India||Most misguided efforts for tiger redistributions failed: K Ullas Karanath||Veteran wildlife biologist and a renowned expert on tigers, K Ullas Karanth, speaks to Sharan Poovanna on the concerns surrounding the human-animal conflict in Karnataka. Edited excerpts:Has there been an increase in human-tiger conflict in Karnataka? If yes, what are the reasons behind it?There has been an increase in the last two decades, but it is still relatively low and mostly restricted to the fringes of the landscape bordering the cluster of major reserves, i.e., Nagarahol National Park (Karnataka), Wayanad (Kerala), Bandipur (Karnataka), Mudumalai (Tamil Nadu) and Biligiri Ranganatha Swamy Temple (Karnataka). This entire area of about 3,000 sq km was relatively better protected from the 1970’s onwards and has attained a high number of tigers since then. Given the natural productivity of the species, one female can produce 10-15 cubs in her lifetime. This leads to an annual surplus of tigers in this region that are wandering off into human-dominated areas. Most of them are either older ones that have been evicted naturally from their home ranges while in some cases, it involves younger animals of two to four years of age which are in search of home ranges to settle down.Are authorities dealing with the problem in the most effective way possible?Not in my opinion, and this is not unique to Karnataka. It starts with the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) and most states handle these incidents with little professional skill or understanding of tiger ecology. The same mistakes and loss of human lives are repeated when the situation is not handled well. When an animal is habituated preying on humans, it must be killed immediately using the quickest possible method. It must be done only by experts and should not take days to “rescue” it as more lives continue to be lost during this period and public animosity towards parks and wildlife increases. This obsession over “saving every individual cat” is an attitude problem and not scientific or useful when it comes to dealing with human-animal conflict.The forest department has said that there been no encroachment of forest land and there is no shortage of food for tigers in the jungles. Do you agree with this assessment?In protected areas like Bandipur, I agree that there is no shortage of food. It is the very nature of their space use patterns. However in reserves like Nagarahol and BRT, an increasing number of humans in settlements within the parks are a major problem. While tigers which are killing people outside the forests can be isolated and shot at quickly, what will you do if these outbreaks happen inside the protected areas? Despite persistent demand from hundreds of forest-dwellers in Nagarahol who have petitioned to be relocated for more than a decade, no one has bothered to take any step. After some good work in the earlier years, this critical conservation step necessary to prevent conflicts has been stalled.However, we must note that the encroachment of potential tiger habitat by humans continues in reserved and deemed forests. This is encouraged by the endless extension of Forest Rights Act procedures, which has caused significant damage. No one, including “conservationists” talk about this out of political correctness.How can authorities contain this problem and what are the challenges they face to ensure the safety of both humans and tigers? Outside the reserves in human-dominated landscapes, human safety must be prioritized. Money and time should not be wasted on ‘tiger rescue’, releasing captive bred tigers, needless translocations, etc. All these interventions only add to the problem.Also, if the tigers involved are old and infirm, even if they are captured, they must be humanely euthanized immediately and not kept in captivity artificially for decades under stressful conditions. “Authorities” have become too insular towards science and expertise, and this needs a cultural change.How have these incidents impacted tiger conservation efforts? The public is becoming increasingly interested in wildlife conservation and as a result, local hunting has taken a dip compared to the 1970s in Karnataka. However, due to the conflict cases, the public is resistant towards the creation of new protected areas. This has come as a huge setback for tiger conservation because more habitats need to be conserved if we are to increase the tiger population beyond the 3,000 we have in India now.Have the conservation efforts led to a higher density of tigers that has further created a new challenge?I would not call them “conservation efforts”. They are artificial and excessive, misguided manipulations of vegetation and water, which have increased prey densities to unnaturally high levels. As a result, the number of tigers has also reached unnaturally high levels. These civil works and vegetation manipulations with huge budgetary outlays are drastically altering the natural state of the habitat and animal density levels. If the park budgets are drastically trimmed, the habitat will revert to a more natural state and prey and tiger densities will also settle down to those levels. We are turning our tiger habitats into “Disney-lands” and the ignorant tourists think that this is a great idea!Can there be more coordination between states to redistribute these animals? What are the challenges to this proposal or approach?It is utterly foolish to think of “redistributing tigers”. They are not chess pieces or cattle to be redistributed in this manner. The distribution will happen naturally once the prey base recovers, and the dispersing animals find new habitats. Most misguided efforts for tiger redistributions across India have failed and can have tragic consequences both for locals as well as the tigers. The problem is, in the absence of any scientific inputs on tiger management, only such failed ideas are going around again and again.We have barely increased the tiger habitat in the last 50 years while the animal’s population has only increased from about 2,000 to 3,000. Look at the progress in other sectors India has made during the same period. It is a sad commentary indeed on the last two decades of failures in wildlife conservations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/most-misguided-efforts-for-tiger-redistributions-across-india-failed-k-ullas-karanath-101615746470999.html
15-03-2021||India||Yatnal doubts transparency of probe by SIT in harassment case against MLA||Basanagouda Ramanagouda Patil (Yatnal), the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) legislator from Karnataka, on Sunday raised doubts over the transparency of the newly formed SIT (special investigation team) set up to probe the alleged case of sexual exploitation by his colleague and former minister, Ramesh Jarkiholi.“This is a big conspiracy and an organised plan to finish him (Jarkiholi) off. They (government) have just given the case to the SIT, which has started the investigation. But I have my doubts on how transparent this will be,” Yatnal, one of the staunchest critics of chief minister B.S Yediyurappa said in Vijayapura on Sunday.Continuing his attacks on the chief minister and his son, B.Y Vijayendra, Yatnal said that SIT might not be the right agency to investigate the case and it should instead be handed to the CBI (central bureau of investigation).“There is one official there (in the SIT) who listens to everything (BY) Vijayendra (Yediyurappa’s son) says,” Yatnal said.The statements come a day after Jarkiholi filed an FIR against the alleged conspirators, who he claimed, tried to defame him and end his political career. Jarkiholi stepped down from his post in the cabinet after a social activist filed a complaint of sexual exploitation of an unnamed woman in the guise of providing her a government job.A video of a person, appearing to be Jarkiholi, was seen getting intimate with the unnamed woman. The video was played on loop by Kannada TV channels in the state until the former minister got an order by the court barring most of the news outlets from doing so.An alleged phone call recording between Jarkiholi and the unnamed woman was also played, in which the person who is suspected to be the former minister is heard saying that Yediyurappa indulges in corruption.The unnamed woman has since released a video statement, seeking protection for herself and her family, claiming they become a target of threats and intimidation since the incident.Yatnal said the video came out right after Jarkiholi filed an FIR. He added that there are many such CDs (videos) of other political leaders in the “homes of the son of one BJP leader and one Congress leader”.At least six ministers of Yediyurappa’s cabinet have sought injunctions from the court, prohibiting at least 68 entities, including Kannada news channels, papers, Twitter, Google and Facebook among others, from publishing, broadcasting or circulation of any content defamatory to them.The alleged sex scandal, rise of Covid-19 cases, protests over demands for higher reservation by dominant caste groups have added to the challenges of Yediyurappa.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/yatnal-doubts-transparency-of-probe-by-sit-in-harassment-case-against-mla-101615746468506.html
15-03-2021||India||Karnataka registers 37% jump in tiger attacks in 2020-21 from last year||There have been at least 434 cases of tigers attacking cattle and humans in Karnataka in 2020-21, registering a 37% increase in such encounters from around 316 in 2019-20, according to data from the state forest department.This includes at least nine deaths of humans in two years, around 10-12 cases of injuries while a majority of them are of cattle being attacked or killed, according to the department.The increasing encounters come even as around 150 forest department and other personnel continued combing operations for a human-eating tiger in the coffee-growing region of Kodagu, about 225 km from Bengaluru.“Territorial fights are the problem as youngsters will push the older ones out, who then move towards human settlements and cattle,” Subhash Malkhade, Additional Chief Conservator of Forests (Wildlife), said. He added that there were no problems of encroachments, poaching or shortage of food within the forests in the state.This particular tiger, who remains at large in Kodagu for nearly eight months now, was suspected to have killed at least three persons, critically injured another person and has so far preyed on around 25 cattle in the district, prompting angry reactions from people living in the region, who have blocked highways and other roads in protest.However, activists, environmentalists and conservationists have raised concerns over the efforts, which according to them, have so far proved ineffective for reasons including the use of inexperienced personnel, the department of being insular from science and expertise, inability to control large crowds, estate owners and even one BJP legislator among others who have been itching to shoot or kill the tiger.On February 21, the forest department had captured a tigress lurking in the locality and the one on the prowl currently is believed to be a male.“The same mistakes and tragic loss of human lives occur repeatedly when things are mishandled. When an animal becomes habituated to preying on humans it must be killed immediately using the quickest possible method and by real experts not by blundering around for days trying to “rescue” it,” K Ullas Karanth, veteran wildlife biologist and one of India’s well-known experts on the subject, said.He added that the delays in the capture of big cats fuel public animosity as the obsession with “saving every individual cat” was an attitude problem, which was neither scientific nor useful to contain the conflict.The incident in Kodagu also highlights the problem of wildlife forced out of reserves for various other reasons.In a 2018 report from the Centre titled, ‘Status of Tigers, copredators & prey in India’, it was shown that only around 1,923 big-cats live within the reserves while around 35% of them were outside the protected forests.With an estimated 524 tigers on last official count, Karnataka is home to the second largest population of these big cats spread over forest ranges like Bandipur, Nagarhole, Biligiri Ranganatha Swamy Temple (BRT) and Bhadra among other reserves.But a growing number of wild animals like tigers, leopards and elephants straying into areas of human settlements, agricultural lands and plantations in search of food outside the forest have been another major reason.Forest department data shows that there have been 17,561 human-animal conflicts in Karnataka in 2020-21 as against 16,314 in 2019-20.Incidents of leopards killing and dragging away dogs, livestock and calves have also been reported from across the state, including Bengaluru, where an increase in commercial activity around ecologically sensitive and fragile areas have led to more big cats wandering out of the forest in search of food.The death—natural or unnatural—of wildlife often garners an outpour of anger and grief on social media largely from people living in cities who are also the most frequent visitors to the tens of hundreds of jungle resorts and safaris that have mushroomed over the last decade or so to accommodate the growing demand.Karnataka is possibly the only state to continue safaris even during the monsoon, leaving very little room for the forest to remain without the noise of jeeps filled with tourists and nature enthusiasts, snaking through them all year long.Over 3.46 lakh people visited national parks and sanctuaries in Karnataka in 2020-21 (until November) due to Covid-19 induced travel restrictions. This number on an average hovers over the 15-lakh mark in normal years.Other developmental projects like railways, roads, construction of resorts, homestays and other works also tend to displace wild animals.“There is no effort to reclaim wildlife corridors that can help animals pushed out of one territory to move into another forest area,” Joseph Hoover, a wildlife activist said.He added that there should be an effort by authorities to hire and use the services of only those people with critical wildlife skills in such areas and not those who “buy” postings on recommendations by elected representatives and others.The government, experts said, are more interested in showing an inflated and often misleading increase in forest cover than reclaiming corridors and allowing commercial activities to flourish, leading to eroding buffer zones around these jungles.Though such conflicts are limited to specific landscapes, Karanth said, that better reproductive rates on account of effective strategies to contain poaching and other reasons has led to higher densities of tigers given that each female can produce 10-15 cubs in its lifetime.“This is producing some annual surplus of tigers in this region, which are dispersing into human dominated landscapes. Most such animals are either old that have been evicted naturally from their home ranges and in some cases younger animals of 2-4 years of age that are in search of home ranges to settle down,” Karanth said.Shrinking spaces forces a higher density of tigers in these areas, which activists claim, has left tigers with less than 10 square km of territory as against earlier requirements of over 25 sq km, forcing more conflicts within them and pushing them closer to human civilisation.Experts also reason that while there may be no encroachments from outside, human settlements from within these parks are a problem for the future as governments stall on requests by forest dwellers to be relocated.“It increases the animosity of people towards tigers, negatively impacts opinion of policy makers towards tigers, increases the risk of assault to frontline staff of the forest department, and causes many other indirect problems. Until conflict is brought down to tolerable limits, wildlife conservation becomes a serious pinch point,” Sanjay Gubbi, a wildlife scientist said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ktaka-registers-37-jump-in-tiger-attacks-in-2020-21-from-last-year-101615746469104.html
15-03-2021||India||SC notice renews debate over holy sites in Varanasi, Mathura||In April 1984, 558 Hindu seers from across India joined forces with leaders of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) at the first Dharm Sansad, or religious Parliament, in the heart of Delhi. Among their main resolutions was a nationwide call to press for the “return” of the holy shrines of Varanasi, Mathura and Ayodhya to the Hindus.As the Ram Janmabhoomi movement gained strength in north India through the 1980s, so did the campaign to remove Muslim religious structures in Mathura, considered by many as the birthplace of Hindu god Krishna, and Varanasi, where the Kashi Vishwanath temple dedicated to Hindu god Shiva stood. In Mathura, the Shahi Eidgah was adjacent to the Krishna temple and in Varanasi, the Gyanvapi mosque shared space with the Vishwanath shrine complex.But in 1991, with mobilisation growing in Ayodhya and the Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid dispute gaining enormous political traction, the then Narasimha Rao government passed a law freezing lawsuits to reclaim any place of worship after India was declared independent, except Ayodhya.In effect, this meant that the movements in Mathura and Varanasi petered out, and seers and Hindu activists focused their energies on the Ram Janmabhoomi. At the time, the Bharatiya Janata Party opposed the law.Now, with the Supreme Court agreeing to review the 1991 Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act, advocates and Hindu seers at Varanasi and Mathura say their claims — currently in litigation in lower courts across Uttar Pradesh — have been boosted. Muslim groups have expressed concern and pointed out that unlike Ayodhya — where a makeshift temple was erected for Hindu god Ram — grand temples already exist in Varanasi and Mathura.“We welcome the news of the Supreme Court agreeing to examine the law. We have the registration papers of the property. It’s a confirmed property of Hindus,” said Mahendra Kumar, one of the advocates in the Mathura case.Last Friday, a bench of Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde and justice AS Bopanna sought the response of three Union ministries, home, law and justice, and culture, on a plea filed by BJP leader Ashwini Kumar Upadhyay against the law that fixed the “character” of all places of worship prevailing as on August 15, 1947, except Ram Janmabhoomi.The petition challenged the provisions of the 1991 Act on the ground that it barred Hindus, Sikhs, Jains and Buddhists from restoring their places of worship and pilgrimage and placed an arbitrary cut-off date by which the “illegal barbarian acts of invaders” were allowed to continue in perpetuity.Vijay Shankar Rastogi, the main advocate in the Varanasi case, also welcomed the top court’s decision and said the 1991 law violated Article 14, 21 and 27 of the Indian Constitution that provided for equality before law, right to life and personal liberty.But he added that the law didn’t apply to the Kashi Vishwanath temple case. “We are not changing the religious character of the place. Any structural change cannot alter the character of the religious place. In Kashi, the walls of first floor were demolished. Also, the deity has not been installed by anyone but the Jyotirlinga [deity] appeared itself thousands of years ago,” he said.In November 2019, the apex court’s verdict paved the way for a Ram temple, work on which has begun in the 2.77-acre site in Ayodhya. The Muslim parties were allocated a five-acre site to build a mosque. That judgment also referred to the 1991 law and said it “imposes a non-derogable obligation towards enforcing our commitment to secularism”.“The five-member bench had devoted almost ten pages to the Places of Worship Act as the basic structure of the constitution and had defined it too. By challenging the law, question is raised on the entire Ayodhya verdict. Thus it should concern all — Hindus or Muslims — who had welcomed the verdict,” said Athar Hussain, the spokesperson of the Indo-Islamic Cultural Foundation, which is responsible for building the mosque. In both cases, litigation is currently on in lower courts.On September 30, last year, a case was filed on behalf of the deity, Sri Krishna Virajman, in the court of the civil judge in Mathura but was dismissed. The petitioner, Ranjana Agnihotri, filed an appeal in the court of Mathura district judge on October 12. The case is pending. While one more petition was filed in the court of district judge, three were filed in the court of civil judge. All petitions seek removal of Shahi Eidgah adjacent to the Shri Krishna temple complex and transfer of 13.37-acre land to the deity.The Varanasi case reached the courts in 1991 when Hindu seers filed a petition in a local court on behalf of the deity, Swayambhu Jyotirlinga Bhagwan Vishweshwar, seeking permission to worship in Gyanvapi mosque area. The petitioners claimed Muslims occupied parts of the temple complex and built a mosque there.After 22 years, on December 10, 2019, Rastogi filed an application in the court of the civil judge, requesting a survey of the entire Gyanvapi compound by the Archaeological Survey of India. He filed the petition as the next friend of the deity.In his petition, he said the first additional district judge, Varanasi, passed an order in 1998, directing a lower court to take evidence from the entire Gyanvapi compound for determining the religious status or character of the compound. Later, the hearing was suspended following a stay order by Allahabad high court.The Anjuman Intezamia Masjid Committee, which runs the mosque, objected to Rastogi’s application in their own petition. Anjuman committee joint secretary Mohammad Yasin said the stay order given by the high court was still effective. Last February, the court of civil judge rejected the objection petition and ordered that the hearing will continue.On the ground, the movements are gaining support from Hindu groups. On September 30 last year, when BJP and VHP leaders were acquitted in the Babri Masjid demolition case, senior Hindu seer Acharya Dharmendra had said, “Abhi to yeh jhanki hai, Mathura Kashi baki hai.”The Akhil Bhartiya Akhara Parishad (ABAP), the top decision-making body of the 13 recognised Hindu monastic orders, also passed a resolution at Prayagraj in September, demanding “liberation” of the two places of worship. Parishad president Mahant Narendra Giri said the ABAP was ready to move the Supreme Court, if needed.“We wish for an amicable solution through consensus to this long-pending demand. We already held talks with the state government,” he said.The state government has not officially commented on the twin demands. But it has announced ambitious development plans in both towns. Chief minister Yogi Adityanath on February 14 announced schemes worth ₹411 crore in Mathura. Work on the flagship Kashi Vishwanath corridor is in full swing in Varanasi.The leader of opposition in UP Assembly and senior Samajwadi Party leader Ramgovind Chaudhary said: “BJP and its forces that support it are busy in these kind of things — how to play with Hindu sentiments and encash it. All the more for all these years they could not and did not do any public interest, welfare, development works. Price rise is unprecedented, unemployment has reached highest in 45 years. So they are back to usual tricks.”While senior BJP leaders maintained silence, other leaders like former party MP Sakshi Maharaj, while talking to media in January 2020, demanded that justice should be done with Hindus by handing over Kashi and Mathura.Some Hindu groups oppose the litigation. The Akhil Bhartiya Teerth Purohit Mahasabha (ABTPM) condemned the filing of the suit in the Mathura court. Its national president Mahesh Pathak said, “The ground realities are different in the two temple cities. While Ram was living in a makeshift temple in Ayodhya, in Mathura a grand temple exists.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-notice-renews-debate-over-holy-sites-in-varanasi-mathura-101615746408742.html
15-03-2021||India||India’s inoculation drive now second largest in world||With 1.26 million doses of vaccines administered on average every day in the last week, India’s inoculation drive is now the world’s second largest – both in terms of daily doses being administered as well as total jabs administered – and is now behind only the US, which is administering 2.5 million doses a day. These statistics highlight how India’s inoculation drive has been picking up pace in the recent days.The development, however, comes at a time when new infections have been rising for the past few weeks, with daily cases crossing the 26,000 mark on Sunday, the first time since December 19, or in 85 days, sparking fears of the start of a new wave of Covid-19 infections. India on Sunday reported 26,360 new Covid cases, taking the country’s total cases to 11,385,170, according to HT’s Covid-19 dashboard.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageIn total, India has administered 29.74 million doses, with 24.31 million people receiving at least one dose as of Saturday night, placing it at the second spot in the world, ahead of the UK, which has administered 25.87 million doses to 24.19 million people as of Saturday, according to data issued by the respective governments.The US, which has administered 101.13 million doses as of Saturday, with 68.88 million people receiving at least one shot, however, is the runaway leader in the world in terms of vaccinations. Brazil is a distant fourth with 11.36 million doses administered till Saturday. India has administered more doses than all of South America (21.42 million doses), according to vaccination data compiled by website Our World in Data.In the past week, 1,259,438 shots have been administered every day in India on average – also the second highest in the world. Much of this increase has come in the past few weeks — India’s daily dose rate has tripled in the last 20 days (it was 415,332 shots a day for week ending February 22). It is only behind the US, which has administered 2,541,597 doses a day in the last seven days. On the distant third spot, the UK has been administering 349,372 shots a day last week. The vaccination process, however, needs to be scaled up in India quickly to break the transmission cycle, experts say. “Although it is heartening to see an increase in pace, It is sort of an underaccomplishment to go at this rate as India has the capacity to cover 7 to 10 million per day,” Dr Giridhara R Babu, head, epidemiology, Indian Institute of Public Health, told HT on Saturday.To be sure, due to the opaque nature of China’s data sharing on Covid-19 over the past year, numbers from Beijing have been excluded from global calculations, even though the country says it has administered 52.52 million doses as on February 28.NEW WAVES INCOMING, INDIA AND ABROADHowever, despite the rising vaccination, several nations including India are again trying to grapple with the start of a new wave of infections, which is threatening to thwart inoculation efforts.Daily infections in India have been growing at an alarming rate again – from Wednesday (March 10) onwards, the country has set four consecutive records for the most single-day infections in 2021. The country has reported 21,168 new cases a day in the past week – the highest since December 27. While this is nowhere close to the peak the country has seen (over 96,000 average cases a day in mid-September), the worrying trend is that it is rising — the case rate dropped to 10,988 for the week ending February 11.This trend isn’t limited to India alone – six out of the 10 countries in the world with the most Covid-19 cases are currently seeing new waves. These are Brazil (the world’s biggest hot spot with 71,419 new cases a day on average in the past week), France (23,273 new cases a day in the last week), Italy (22,160 new cases a day), Turkey (13,826), and Germany (9,675). The US, the world’s worst-hit country so far, is currently seeing 55,356 new cases a day, but the trendline is currently declining, which many experts have said is the first glimpse of the country’s immense vaccination drive paying dividends.In Europe, many countries have either kicked off fresh lockdowns or are on the verge it.In Italy, locals on Monday rushed to parks, shopping centres and to get haircuts before a majority of the country goes into lockdown on Monday to try to curb a surge in cases. Italian PM Mario Draghi backed the lockdown because infections are at three-month highs and the country’s vaccine programme has faced a spotty roll-out. Italy has suffered more than 100,000 deaths, the most in Europe after the UK.Officials in France said the Paris region may be headed toward a new lockdown as a third wave of infections has started to fill up ICUs and low vaccine supplies have dragged down inoculation efforts.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indias-inoculation-drive-now-second-largest-in-world-101615745738512.html
15-03-2021||India||Slugfest intensifies over Vaze’s arrest, NIA role||The political slugfest over the security scare near industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s residence and the subsequent arrest of Mumbai Police officer Sachin Vaze intensified on Sunday. While the ruling Shiv Sena termed the National Investigation Agency (NIA)’s intervention as an attempt to “destabilise the state”, the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) alleged a deeper conspiracy and called for the resignation of chief minister Uddhav Thackeray.Addressing reporters in Mumbai, Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut said repeated attempts were being made by the Centre to take over cases that are being probed by the city or state police to demoralise the forces. “The manner in which the NIA came to Mumbai for just 20 gelatin sticks (begs the question): Did they want to investigate a terror angle or just wanted to arrest an officer named Sachin Vaze to settle political scores? This officer, some months ago, had arrested their dear TV anchor in connection with a suicide case and was probing the TRP scam,” the Sena’s chief spokesperson said.He added that the Centre was only trying to put pressure on the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi-led government. “The Mumbai Police is capable of investigating any case. But they want to enter the state to try and destabilise it, demoralise the police to show the terror and pressure of the Centre. There was no need for a central team. The cops here can unearth a conspiracy, if there is one,” Raut said.Speaking on similar lines, revenue minister and Congress leader Balasaheb Thorat said: “The government keeps changing but the police force remains the same everywhere. Maharashtra and Mumbai Police are famous for its work across the world. Mumbai Police is equated to the Scotland Yard. With the central agency taking over, we suspect if there is politics behind it.”Former chief minister and BJP leader, however, said those backing Vaze should be investigated thoroughly. “I am of the opinion that the case is not limited to Sachin Vaze. It is a big plot and many more names will be revealed during the course of the probe. It is just the beginning. Now, the NIA has sought Vaze’s custody for parking the car (outside Ambani’s residence) but the agency has already got evidence and links on Hiran’s murder as well. I am expecting action on that front soon,” he said.Nationalist Congress Party chief Sharad Pawar refused to comment on the case. “I can’t speak much about it as it is a small and local issue. It is also not about the state government’s policy,” he said at Baramati in Pune on Sunday.BJP leader Prasad Lad said, “The chief minister should take moral responsibility and tender his resignation. He had asked if Sachin Vaze was Osama Bin Laden. The NIA should also take over the Mansukh Hiren case and get to the bottom of the conspiracy.”Meanwhile, Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh said that both the NIA and Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) are probing the case and appropriate action would be taken on the basis of the findings. “The bomb scare case related to industrialist Mukesh Ambani and murder of Mansukh Hiren are being probed by the NIA as well as the ATS,” he told reporters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/slugfest-intensifies-over-vaze-s-arrest-nia-role-101615746228103.html
15-03-2021||India||Vaze held, Tihar angle: Tracing the trail of probe||A special National Investigation Agency (NIA) court in Mumbai on Sunday remanded assistant police inspector Sachin Vaze to custody till March 25 after the central agency arrested him late on Saturday for his alleged role in planting explosives in a vehicle found parked outside billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s house on February 25.He is also under investigation for his role in the suspicious death of 48-year-old Mansukh Hiran, a Thane-based auto spare parts businessman, who was linked to the Scorpio.Here’s what we know of Vaze’s alleged role — and the investigation into this case — so far.A car outside AntiliaOn February 25, when Bharat Patil, a security officer at Antilia, made a call to the Mumbai police control room and the Gamdevi police station regarding a suspicious SUV parked opposite the house where the Ambanis reside, Vaze, the head of the Crime Intelligence Unit, was one of the many officers who arrived at the scene.A Bomb Detection and Disposal Squad (BDDS) officer said the 2.5kg gelatin was enough to trigger a low-intensity blast, but that the gelatin sticks were not in the form of an assembled explosive device.On February 26, Vaze was made lead investigator in the case and CCTV footage revealed that the Scorpio car arrived the previous night, accompanied by an Innova, and the driver left in the Innova after sitting in the car for a few hours. The driver was not visible. The Innova was later found at a toll point. The case was transferred to a higher ranking officer of the Maharashtra Anti-Terrorism Squad after the Opposition began to demand that the NIA be called in to investigate.The police were able to link the car to Hiran within hours primarily because the Thane-based businessman reported it stolen on February 18.It turned out that Hiran was using the car for the past three years, but it did not belong to him. It was given to him in lieu of a payment a man named Peter Newton defaulted on. On February 17, Hiran parked the car on the side of the road after the steering wheel got jammed while he was driving it. The next day, he visited the spot, but found the car missing. Hiran visited the CIU on February 26. He admitted that the car was his, but it had not been in his possession for over a week.Between February 26 and March 4, Hiran was questioned. On March 5, his body washed ashore at a creek in Thane district. His belongings were missing, and his face was found covered with a scarf, with handkerchiefs stuck into his mouth.The Union home ministry later directed NIA to take over the investigation into the explosives from the ATS; the FIR filed in the Gamdevi police station was re-registered and on March 9, an NIA team landed in Mumbai and began its investigations. It met various police officers who were part of the initial investigation, including Vaze, assistant commissioner of police Nitin Alaknure and ACP Sripad Kale.A statement that set the ball rolling Two days after his death, Hiran’s wife Vimla recorded her statement with ATS, which was now also tasked with investigating the murder. Her statement spoke at great length of Vaze’s connection to Hiran, and the Scorpio.In her statement, Vimla told the investigators that Hiran, who knew Vaze well, lent him the Scorpio (that was found parked outside Antilia) in November 2020. Vaze’s driver dropped off the car at Hiran’s shop in Thane, on February 5, 2021. The car, she stated, had been in possession of Vaze for four months.On March 4, Vimala said her husband returned from his shop at 8.30pm and told her that he was going to meet a police officer named Tawade, somewhere along Ghodbunder Road. Vimala told the investigating team that when she tried calling her husband at 11pm, his mobile phone was switched off. Later at night, when Hiran had still not returned home, Vinod called Vaze who reportedly expressed surprise at the meeting and informed Vinod that Hiran had not mentioned that he was going to meet Tawde.The following morning, Hiran’s son Meet, and Vinod lodged a missing person’s report. Hiran’s body was found by fishermen on March 5 around 10.30am. Prima facie, the police said, it seemed that Hiran died by suicide. But Vimla contested that claim. She told the ATS team that Hiran was too good a swimmer to have drowned. “Taking into consideration all the above circumstances, I am sure that my husband was murdered,” her statement read. “I suspect Sachin Vaze could have committed the said murder.”Based on her statement, ATS began to treat Hiran’s death not as a case of suicide or accidental drowning.The ATS team questioned Vaze for several hours. On Friday, March 12, Vaze filed an anticipatory bail plea, which came up for hearing on Saturday. In his application, Vaze stated that he was in Dongri, South Mumbai, at the time of Hiran’s disappearance on the night of March 4, when the businessman left his home and didn’t return.Vaze, the officerVaze joined the Maharashtra police force in 1990 as a sub inspector. His first posting was in Gadchiroli, a Maoist-affected area and he was moved to Thane city police in 1992. It was there that he gained a reputation of being a good criminal investigator.In 2000, Vaze was transferred to the Powai unit of the Mumbai crime branch. It was during his stint there that, together with three other policemen, he faced a charge of murdering Khawaja Yunus, an accused in the 2002 Ghatkopar blast case. Vaze resigned from service on November 30, 2007. The following year, he joined the Shiv Sena.Vaze was reinstated in the police force on June 6, 2020. So were the three other policemen who were booked for their alleged involvement in Yunus’s custodial death. A dispute over the framing of charges in this case is pending before the Bombay high court.On Saturday, Vaze’s WhatsApp status made a reference to this case, when he wrote: “3rd March 2004. Fellow officers from the CID arrested me in a false case. That arrest inconclusive till date. Sensing the history is going to repeat. My fellow officers are on to falsely trap me.”A Tihar jail angleIndian Mujahideen terrorist Tehseen Akhtar was on Saturday questioned for “nearly four hours” inside the Tihar Jail by a team of the Delhi Police’s Special Cell in connection with the Mukesh Ambani bomb scare probe, according to officials. A mobile phone, recovered from Akhtar’s barrack in Tihar Jail, is suspected to have been used for creating a Telegram channel used by a group named Jaish-ul-Hind for claiming responsibility for parking the SUV with gelatin sticks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vaze-held-tihar-angle-tracing-the-trail-of-probe-101615746227598.html
15-03-2021||India||Quad offers spark of hope amid pandemic: Leaders||After creating history by holding the first-ever summit of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue — also called the Quad — leaders of the four member countries have written a joint op-ed offering their partnership as a “spark of hope to light the path ahead” in the darkness brought on by the Covid-19 pandemic.India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Australia’s Prime Minister Scott Morrison, Japan’s Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga and US President Joe Biden met virtually on Friday for the first time at the summit level for the fledgling group. They have said they plan to meet in person later in the year.They launched a Vaccine Initiative under which India will produce up to 1 billion doses of Covid-19 vaccines by 2022, financed by the US and Japan, for last-mile distribution by Australia in the South-East Asian nations of the Indo-Pacific.“Over the course of these past months, each of us has grieved the suffering that our people and the world have endured. But in this dark hour, our partnership offers a spark of hope to light the path ahead,” the leaders wrote in a joint op-ed in The Washington Post on Saturday.“We summon from tragedy the strength and resilience to unify and overcome. And we recommit ourselves, once again, to an Indo-Pacific region that is free, open, secure and prosperous,” they added.The article repeated the announcements from Friday, and much of what appeared in the joint statement and the fact sheet that were released after the summit. It also recalled the history of the grouping from being founded in the aftermath of the 2004 tsunami, to being turned into a dialogue in 2007 to being reborn in 2017.The leaders described the Quad as a “flexible group of like-minded partners dedicated to advancing a common vision and to ensuring peace and prosperity”. And the member countries, the leaders added, were “a group of democratic nations dedicated to delivering results through practical cooperation”.Since the 2004 tsunami, the world has come to face other challenges such as climate change, which has grown more perilous; new technologies, which have “revolutionized our daily lives”, geopolitics have become ever more complex, and a pandemic has devastated the world, they wrote, adding: “Against this backdrop, we are recommitting to a shared vision for an Indo-Pacific region that is free, open, resilient and inclusive.”The leaders also wrote about the Quad Vaccine Experts Group, which they announced on Friday to support cooperation in the long term. They also reiterated their commitment to cooperating as a group to combat climate change and deal with emerging technologies, which will be led by the Quad Climate Working Group and the Quad Critical and Emerging Technology Working Group.But they will not be an insular group and will work with other countries and groups. “We welcome and will seek opportunities to work with all of those who share in those goals,” they wrote. Other countries and groups of countries have expressed the desire to work with the Quad, which was discussed at the summit, officials have said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/quad-offers-spark-of-hope-amid-pandemicleaders-101615746167966.html

15-03-2021||India||Pak resorted to highest number of border violations just before LoC ceasefire||Pakistan resorted to the highest ever ceasefire violations during the 12 months preceding the announcement by the Indian and Pakistani militaries that they had begun strictly observing a ceasefire along the Line of Control (LoC) from the midnight of February 24, according to government data.The two countries first agreed in 2003 to observe the truce along their de facto border in Jammu & Kashmir.Also Read | 1999 Kargil war: Ex-Pak envoy denies US diplomat’s claimAccording to government data accessed by HT, the Pakistani army violated the ceasefire at least a dozen times on average daily between February 2020 and February 2021.Pakistan resorted to 4,645 violations in 2020. August and September 2020 accounted for the highest number of violations for any two consecutive months in 17 years.The number of violations was more than 5,100 if those along the international border are also counted. The escalation in ceasefire violations coincided with the first anniversary of the Centre’s move in August to strip Jammu & Kashmir of its semi-autonomous status that Islamabad reacted sharply to.The data shows 835 ceasefire violations were reported in August and September last year. “There were 427 ceasefire violations on the LoC in August 2020. That is the highest number for any single month since November 2003. The Indian Army responded forcefully to the Pakistani violations. The LoC was most active last year since 2003,” said an official, asking not to be named.Ceasefire violations sharply increased over the last five years – recording a 10-fold jump since 2016 when India carried out surgical strikes against terror pads in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir in response to the Islamabad-backed suicide attack on an army camp in Uri. The year 2016 accounted for 449 violations, with the numbers only increasing in the following years – 881 (2017), 1629 (2018), and 3168 (2019).Pakistan resorts to ceasefire violations to help terrorists sneak into Jammu & Kashmir to destabilise the region.“It is a positive [move] that India and Pakistan have agreed to renew and abide by the ceasefire,” said Lieutenant General Vinod Bhatia (retd), a former Director-General of Military Operations (DGMO).“At the tactical level, the Indian Army has raised the costs for Pakistan by effective retaliation to ceasefire violations, as also the robust counter-infiltration grid has effectively neutralised any major infiltration bids…India also benefits from a cold LoC, but the army will still need to be on the high vigil,” Bhatia said.He added lowering tensions can also facilitate the resumption of talks at the diplomatic and political level. “The effort should be to sustain the ceasefire for as long as possible. But the challenge for India will be to change Pakistan’s behaviour as it continues with its proxy war.”In a rare meeting, Bhatia as DGMO met his Pakistani counterpart at the Attari-Wagah border near Amritsar on December 24, 2013, to discuss ways to restore calm along the Line of Control. There were no ceasefire violations by Pakistan for almost seven months after those talks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/highest-number-of-border-violations-by-pakistan-before-february-ceasefire-101615533278418.html
