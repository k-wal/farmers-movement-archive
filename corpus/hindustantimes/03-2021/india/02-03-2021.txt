The market’s star landmark Krishna Dhaba was hit by a tragedy last month.Aakash Mehra, 25, the only son of the eatery’s owner Ramesh Chandra Mehra was shot-at on February 17 and succumbed to his injuries 11 days later.The eatery is famous for its vegetarian dishes which attract a large number of customers and has been the main reason for the flurry of activity in the area. Among its clientele, are many of Srinagar’s influential and prominent people.Other shopkeepers in the locality said that the young Mehra was studying in Jammu and had come to help his father after the lockdown induced by the Covid-19 pandemic was lifted a few months back.Mehra’s extended family, which is originally from Jammu and has been here for the past many decades, runs four eateries and two general stores in the market. There are half a dozen Kashmir art shops and a sweet store run by locals and a commercial complex near Krishna dhaba. All the shops mostly have been rented out by a trust. While the Mehra’s have been closed since the attack, the whole market was shut on Sunday and Monday as a mark of protest over the killing. Though the other shops were open on Tuesday, the roadside carts which would add to the hustle and bustle outside the Mehra’s dhaba were absent.“Everybody in this market is heartbroken. The market closed for two days after his death. This place is famous because of them and they are always helpful to everyone here,” said Javaid Ahmad Khan, who runs a Kashmir art outlet just opposite the dhaba on the other side of the road.“I live here and have grown up with them. During floods in 2014, they also helped in organising a langar here” he said. “They have been here for many decades and nobody raised a finger against them during the thick of militancy”.Khan was in his shop when the attack took place on the late evening of February 17 as most of Srinagar was observing a spontaneous shutdown during the visit of a delegation of EU envoys.He heard the sound of the first bullet late evening and thought it was a firecracker. The sound of two more shots sent people scurrying. Khan rushed out of his shop and ran to the dhaba where Mehra was lying injured.“I didn’t see them but people say they came on a bike, went to the counter and fired thrice at him. There was a lot of rush that day owing to strike on the occasion of the visit of a foreign delegation,” he said.Khan said that he visited the injured Mehra in the hospital on the second day before he underwent a surgery for his perforated intestines. “He asked if I had seen them. I said, no, I was inside. I thought he would be fine but then his condition deteriorated after the surgery,” he said.Police have already arrested three persons involved in the attack who they said have confessed to the crime. Kashmir’s inspector general of police (IGP) Vijay Kumar had said on February 19 that the trio was newly recruited militants and was instigated by The Resistance Front (TRF) to strike at Krishna Dhaba where tourist rush is always high and the shop even remains open during hartals. The police have also recovered the bike and the pistol used in the attack.However, most of the people in the market said that the Mehra’s would always close on the occasion of strike calls.“They would always close their shop on hartals. That day many other shops were also open. It was not clear why they opened that day but it may be because there was ambiguity as there was no call of shutdown. But that does not mean they should be killed. There seems to be some conspiracy behind this,” said an auto driver who often ferries tourists to the area.“We had witnessed a good rush of tourists from January 20 to February 15. Now it is just silence,” he said.The traders have been mulling to send a delegation to express their condolences to the Mehra family in Jammu.“Whosoever did this is condemnable. He was an innocent young man. The market has been desolate since Krishna Dhaba closed. It was the reason for the footfall in our trade outlets,” said Manzoor Ahmad, president of Durga-Nag Traders’ Union.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/srinagar-market-desolate-after-death-of-eatery-owner-s-son-in-militant-attack-101614706700242.html

His action clearly violates the provisions of Part VII (Party in Power) of the Model Code of Conduct that clear states: “The party in power whether at the Centre or in the State or States concerned, shall ensure that no cause is given for any complaint that it has used its official position for the purposes of its election campaign and in particular…(4) Issue of advertisement at the cost of public exchequer in the newspapers and oter media.”HT has a copy of the letter.The Election Commission announced the poll schedules for West Bengal, Assam, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Puducherry on February 26.The election in Bengal will be held in eight phases between March 27 and April 29. Modi is scheduled to address an election rally at Kolkata’s Brigade Parade Grounds on March 7. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has planned 20 rallies for him in the coming days.“After elections have been declared, the PM is debarred from publicizing this name and claiming credit in this manner through the government's Co-WIN platform of vaccination,” the letter says.“By placing his photograph, name and message on the provisional certificates issued by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, he is not only exploiting his post and powers but also stealing commendable credit from the producers of Covid vaccines. He is bluntly appropriating the dues of the vast army of selfless doctors, nurses and health service workers,” O’Brien wrote.Reacting to the TMC’s allegation, Bengal BJP’s chief spokesperson Samik Bhattacharya said, “The ECI will surely look into the complaint. However, the TMC has lost its political and moral right to raise such issues because we have seen how chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s photographs have been misused.”“Millions of people in Bengal could have seen the Prime Minister’s photographs all these years had the TMC government not changed the names of the Centre’s welfare schemes and passed those as its own. The chief minister’s face was used to publicise these,” Bhattacharya added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-s-photo-on-vaccination-certificate-violates-model-code-tmc-tells-eci-101614704488606.html

It was read out to journalists later by senior Raijor Dal functionaries.“I appeal to all opposition parties that in order to defeat the communal and fascist BJP we should put up one common candidate against the BJP and its alliance partners,” said the letter.“That will help prevent division of anti-BJP votes. If required, I will not contest the election,” it added.Raijor Dal and another newly formed outfit, Assam Jatiya Parishad have decided to contest the election jointly, but have decided to stay away from the Congress-led grand alliance which has All India United Democratic Front, Bodoland Peoples Front, three Left parties and a new regional party as partners.On the other hand, the BJP is continuing its alliance with Asom Gana Parishad and tied-up with United Peoples Party Liberal.Terming AIUDF as a communal party similar to BJP, Gogoi said that was the prime reason why his party decided to stay away from the Congress-led grand alliance.The assembly election in Assam will be held in three phases on March 27, April1 and April 6.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jailed-assam-leader-urges-parties-to-put-up-common-candidates-against-bjp-101614701784068.html

The notice was issued on March 1 by the DM of Imphal West district and served on Tuesday morning. “It has come to the notice of the undersigned that you are providing online services on news and current affairs on the social media platform,” the notice said, further directing the publisher/intermediary to “furnish all relevant documents that ensure compliance of the provisions” of the new rules, failing which, it warned, “steps as deemed fit shall be initiated without further notice.”This was probably the first instance in the country of such action against against a digital news platform.Significantly, the programme is hosted on the Facebook page of Kishorechandra Wangkhem, an Imphal-based journalist, against whom the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government has slapped several cases, also jailing him thrice. Reacting to the notice, Kishorechandra told HT, “We’ve hosted just four-five shows. The last show aired on February 28 and was titled ‘Media Under Siege: Are Journalists Walking a Tightrope.’” Kishorechandra, also an associate editor of Frontier Manipur, Kishorechandra spoke to HT over the phone from Imphal.Frontier Manipur works in collaboration with a news portal called Seven Salai, and uses the latter’s infrastructure. Paojel Chaoba is the publisher and executive director of Frontier Manipur.In January, Chaoba, along with Frontier Manipur editor-in-chief, Dhiren Sadokpam, was detained for more than 24 hours on the basis of an FIR filed by a police officer over an opinion piece titled ‘Revolutionary Journey in a Mess.’||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/notice-against-manipuri-talk-show-served-under-new-digital-media-laws-revoked-101614700327923.html

Senior leader AV Gopinath, former legislator and Palakkad district Congress president, on Tuesday announced his decision to contest as a rebel in Palakkad constituency if he was denied a ticket for the polls. The assembly polls in the state will be held on April 6.The ruling Communist Party of India (Marxist) and the Bharatiya Janata Party have welcomed the sulking leader to their camps. “I have been side-lined for quite some time and party leaders never bother to consult me when they take decisions. There is a limit to humiliation. If age is a factor it should be applicable to all. It is unfair to side-line a select few,” said Gopinath announcing his decision to contest.The CPI (M) Palakkad district committee said it will take necessary steps if he quits the party. The BJP which has a sizeable base in the district has also promised its support to him. Gopinath said he is in touch with many senior leaders of the CPI (M).Last month senior leader and former Union minister Prof KV Thomas had threatened to walk out of the party but he was placated after the intervention of party president Sonia Gandhi. Later, he was appointed as the working president of the state unit. Party leaders fear that dissension may heighten in the coming days-- posters and notices have started appearing at many places against probable candidates. Party leaders fear that dissension may heighten in the coming days-- posters and notices have started appearing at many places against probable candidates. Hectic efforts are on to convince Gopinath but people close to him said he has made up his mind. The Congress has reportedly promised him a key organisational position but he has declined it.Desperately trying to grab power after a five-year hiatus, the Congress leadership has already announced that win ability will be the sole criteria and more youngsters and women will be inducted in the list of candidates. Party leader Rahul Gandhi, a member of parliament from the state, has made it clear that the selection process will carry his stamp and dividing seats on the basis of faction allegiance will not happen this time. Two prominent groups, one led by former CM Oommen Chandy and the other by opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala, call shots in the party.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rebel-woes-pose-a-threat-to-congress-in-poll-bound-kerala-101614695908445.html

The petition questioned the February 26 decision of the poll panel declaring eight-phase polling in West Bengal as against three phases in Assam, and a single phase in the states of Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Union Territory of Puducherry.“Conducting election in eight phases while in single phase in other states, especially when West Bengal is not facing any terrorist attack or under disputed war zone…is a clear case of violation of Article 14 (right to equality) of the Constitution of India,” read the petition.Along with the issue of holding polls, the petition even urged the top poll body to take note of the “Jai Shri Ram” slogan being used as a religious tool by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to seek votes ahead of the polls.The petition demanded the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to register a case against Union home minister Amit Shah and state BJP leader Suvendu Adhikari for promoting enmity by raising the religious slogan.Sharma asked the apex court to decide whether use of a provocative religious slogan “Jai Shri Ram” should be treated as an electoral offence under Sections 123(3) and 125 of the Representation of the People Act which does not permit a candidate or anybody associated with the election to promote feeling of hatred on grounds of religion, race, caste, community or language.“Using the slogan ‘Jai Shri Ram’ is liable to be prohibited and whoever, individual or party or group of person of a party uses it prior to election or during election or thereafter must be prohibited to participate in election,” Sharma stated in his petition.In addition, the petition included a prayer to debar the political party indulging in such actionsElections will begin in West Bengal on March 27 and the results will be announced on May 2.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/on-west-bengal-elections-in-8-phases-a-plea-in-supreme-court-101614695331226.html

02-03-2021||India||Police crackdown on villagers sparks pandemonium in Uttarakhand assembly||Monday’s lathi charge and the use of water cannons by the police against villagers demanding the widening of a road sparked pandemonium on the second day of the budget session of the Uttarakhand assembly on Tuesday with the opposition raising the issue to berate the government.Attacking the government and accusing it of "high handedness" against the protestors especially women while drawing parallels with British rule and calling it "General Dyer's government", the opposition MLAs led by Indira Hridayesh moved into the well of the House demanding an apology from the government over Monday's incident before staging a walkout and holding a sit-in protest at the entrance of the assembly and raising slogans against the government.Several villagers including women were injured in the police action.Congress MLA Pritam Singh raised the issue from Opposition by moving a motion on the same during which he accused the government of resorting to "high handedness against villagers who were exercising their democratic right to hold protest for their demand of widening the 19-km road in their village in Ghat area near Gairsain.""The villagers have been holding their protest for over 80 days but the government didn't pay any heed after which they came to Gairsain because they had no choice. But the government instead of listening to them, lathi charged them and attacked them with water cannons injuring women which was extremely shameful," said Singh."The police on the order of this government attacked the women and elderly which reminded us of General Dyer during the British rule who ordered fire on the freedom fighters at Jallianwala Bagh. It seems this government is hell-bent on crushing any protest against it and doesn't believe in democracy," he said.Accusing the government of insulting the "motherhood of the hills", Hridayesh demanded an apology from the government over the incident."If this government has come to power to insult the motherhood of the hills who are the backbone of this society, then it should resign and offer its apology to them in this House," said Hridayesh who also attacked chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat for "calling the protesters Andolanjivi" on Twitter on Tuesday after ordering a magisterial probe into the incident late Monday evening.Later while answering the Opposition on the matter, parliamentary affairs minister Madan Kaushik said that, "The villagers' protest was going on peacefully near the police barricade 6 km away from the Assembly when it suddenly turned violent. The police used water cannons to control them as a usual process when some villagers started pelting stones and glass bottles at the policemen."As soon as he said that the villagers pelted stones at the police, the Opposition erupted again objecting to his statement and moved towards the well of the House accusing Kaushik of "giving wrong information in the House."The Opposition MLAs then staged a walkout and held a sit-in at the entrance of the House raising slogans against the government accusing it of "exploiting and insulting the women of hills."The Opposition had staged a walkout once before in the day following a heated debate during an adjournment motion on price rise.Speaking on the issue, Hridayesh accused the government of "doing nothing to control skyrocketing prices of essential commodities including fuel and food items.""The common man is suffering because of very high fuel prices which are more than the neighbouring countries including Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka, China and others. He is also not able to have a two-time meal due to high prices of food items. The government is doing nothing to give any relief to them," said Hridayesh.Countering her minister Kaushik presented the comparative figures of fuel prices in states of Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan, Punjab and West Bengal saying the "Uttarakhand has fuel prices lower than all these states". The opposition then walked out citing "unsatisfactory answers by the government on price rise."Earlier during the day, Opposition MLA Qazi Nizamuddin and minister Kaushik were involved in a heated debate after the former raised the issue of the government "not following the rules for House proceedings".Nizamuddin raising the issue said, "Since last four years, CM Rawat who holds many important departments like home, health, finance, excise and others is not present in the House during questions about his departments which is beyond our understanding. Also, as per the rule, a debate on the budget should be there after two days of it being tabled so as to give time to the members to study it. But this is not being done ever."Kaushik objected saying, "The agenda of the House is decided after a meeting with the business advisory committee which includes the leader of opposition. It is then passed by the Speaker also. After all this, if an objection is raised then it is not fair."Despite the pandemonium, the House passed two amendment bills related to a change in a non-government university operating in Uttarakhand and the other related to marketing of agricultural produce and livestock.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/police-crackdown-on-villagers-sparks-pandemonium-in-uttarakhand-assembly-101614694275647.html

Rajewal added that the union will not support any political party in the upcoming assembly elections.“We'll send teams to poll-bound states - to West Bengal and Kerala. We will not support any party but appeal to people to vote for the candidates who can defeat BJP. We will tell people about Modi govt's attitude towards farmers,” Rajewal said at the press meet, according to news agency ANI.BKU leader Rakesh Tikait, who has been holding Kisan Panchayats all over the country to drum up support against the new farm laws, announced in February that farmers will be going on a tour of poll-bound West Bengal since farmers there do not get fair price for their crops.“We will definitely go to West Bengal; it is not as if the state is outside the country. We are getting a lot of response from our panchayats and this has baffled the government. Farmers are facing issues in West Bengal as well and their issues should find a way to the manifestos of political parties who intend to come to power. There, farmers are not getting the appropriate price (for their crops) while those involved in fisheries are also facing problems,” Tikait said.Swaraj India founder Yogendra Yadav was also present at Tuesday’s press conference. He reiterated Rajewal’s words, adding that the programme is scheduled to begin on March 12 with a public meeting in Kolkata.“In the Assembly elections, we will appeal to people to punish this party (BJP) and its allies who brought anti-farmer laws. We will go to the boll-bound states. This programme will begin in Kolkata on March 12 with a public meeting,” said Yadav.BKU has plans to spread the movement against the farm laws to non-poll bound states of the country. Tikait had also announced in late February that he will undertake a tour of Uttarakhand, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, and Telangana in March to garner support for the ongoing farmers’ protest. "Farmers' meetings will be held in Uttarakhand, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka and Telangana, while two meetings will also be held in Uttar Pradesh in March," BKU media in-charge Dharmendra Malik told reporters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/-will-send-team-to-poll-bound-states-ask-people-to-vote-for-candidates-who-can-defeat-bjp-says-farmer-leader-101614694045964.html

The incident took place when the Governor's family members had come to watch the House proceedings and their faces blenched, he added.Thakur stated that the Congress resorted to such an act as it has lost its political ground.The CM said he and his entire cabinet apologised to the Governor for the incident but the Opposition has no shame. Defending the action by the deputy speaker, the chief minister said the entire government is with him. He did what he should have done in such circumstances, Thakur said.On the chief minister’s request, the Speaker initiated the proceedings of the question hour at 11.55 am after the Congress staged a walkout from the House.After the Congress walkout, Deputy Speaker Hansraj said he wants protection from the House as he is receiving threats from the Congress student wing NSUI and its "goons".Earlier in the day, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Suresh Bhardwaj said the suspended Congress MLAs should tender an unconditional apology to the Governor. Subsequently, the issue of their suspension may be discussed, he said.Meanwhile, Congress MLA Asha Kumari termed the proceedings of the special meeting of the Assembly regarding the episode on Friday afternoon illegal as it had been called at a notice of four minutes, which is against the rules.The MLA said several legislators had already left the Assembly as the House was adjourned till Monday at 2 pm.Asha Kumari said no Congress MLA tried to stop the Governor on his way to his car from the Speaker's office. On the contrary, the deputy speaker and the parliamentary Affairs minister pushed the Congress MLAs, she said.The ruling party should have told the Opposition that the Governor won’t be reading his entire address, she added.Meanwhile, the suspended Congress MLAs continued their dharna outside the House on the second day consecutively against the registration of an FIR against them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-walks-out-of-hp-assembly-over-mlas-supension-101614681060293.html

No serious side effect has been reported so far," Shailaja said.Over 1000 centres have already been set up in various districts across the state for people to take the jab, she said.Apart from this, a mass vaccination centre was set up in Thiruvanathapuram recently on an experimental basis.The possibility of similar mass centres would also be looked into in the coming days so that more people can get vaccinated at the same time, she said.To get vaccinated, everyone should register at the prescribed portal beforehand and the shot should be taken on a priority basis.Barring a slight technical issue while registering, there were no other hurdles reported in Kerala in connection with the registration, the minister added.Urging people to take the second dose also without any fail after 28 days, Shailaja said they should not assume that they would be immune after receiving the first dose.Immunity would be achieved only 14 days after that, she said, adding people should be vigilant till then.Stating that the state's fight against Covid-19 was progressing in a scientific manner, she said though the viral infection was first reported in the country in Kerala, its peak was last seen here.In other states, the death toll rose sharply as the graph scaled up."At the same time, the mortality rate in Kerala is still 0.4 per cent," she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-health-minister-2-cabinet-colleagues-take-first-dose-of-covid-19-vaccine-101614689528837.html

When he was screened for Covid-19, he was found to be positive. Later the swab samples of those who had come in contact with him were tested through the same batch of kits and they were too found to be positive.The Sambalpur Municipal Corporation had also declared shutdown in the university campus and its adjacent areas. Besides, the examinations scheduled to be held on March 1 in the university too were postponed and classes were held online.Till February 9 this year, Odisha had conducted over 75.79 lakh Covid tests of which 79.5 per cent were through Rapid Antigen tests.

The notice under the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021 notified on February 25, was issued on March 1 and served on Tuesday morning to the publisher/intermediary of Khanasi Neinasi, the talk show which means ‘Let’s Talk’ in Manipuri.Incidentally, the show is hosted on Facebook page of Kishorechandra Wangkhem, an Imphal-based journalist against whom the ruling BJP-led government in the state has slapped several cases since 2018 and jailed him thrice.The notice issued by Naorem Praveen Singh, district magistrate of Imphal West district, says, “It has come to the notice of the undersigned that you are providing online services on news and current affairs on the social media platform.”The publisher/intermediary were directed to “furnish all relevant documents that ensure compliance of the provisions” of the new rules “failing which steps as deemed fit shall be initiated without further notice”.The programme Khanasi Neinasi is around two months old and besides being shown on Facebook it was also telecast on the YouTube channel of Frontier Manipur, an Imphal-based digital news platform.“We have hosted just 4-5 shows. The last show aired on February 28 (a day before the notice was issued) was titled ‘Media Under Siege: Are Journalists Walking a Tightrope’” Kishorechandra, who’s also an associate editor of Frontier Manipur, told HT over the phone from Imphal.Frontier Manipur is in collaboration with another news portal called Seven Salai and uses the latter’s infrastructure.

02-03-2021||India||Brinda Karat writes to CJI urging him to withdraw 'marriage' remarks made at bail hearing of rape accused||CPI(M) Politburo member Brinda Karat has written to Chief Justice of India SA Bobde urging him to withdraw his remarks made during the hearing of a case where he asked a rape accused if he was willing to marry the victim, saying that courts should not give an impression of supporting such "retrograde" approaches.Karat was referring to remarks made during the hearing of a plea filed by a public servant, who is accused of repeatedly raping a girl, against the Bombay High Court February 5 order which had cancelled his anticipatory bail.The Left leader said that these questions, words and actions have serious implications in granting of bail in cases of rape of minors."Please reconsider and withdraw these comments and questions... Please uphold the judgment of the Aurangabad High Court which rules that bail granted to him by the lower court was 'atrocious'," she said.When the hearing on the plea commenced on Monday, the bench also comprising Justices A S Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian, asked the accused “Are you willing to marry her?”“If you are willing to marry her then we can consider it, otherwise you will go to jail,” observed the bench adding “We are not forcing you to marry.”The counsel appearing for the petitioner said the accused was initially willing to marry the girl but she had refused and now he was married to someone else.As the counsel said that the accused is a public servant, the bench said, “You should have thought this before seducing and raping the girl. You knew that you are a government servant”.The apex court granted the accused protection from arrest for four weeks to allow him to apply for regular bail in the trial court.In the letter, Karat said, "The girl was gagged and raped by this criminal, when she was just sixteen years old. He repeated his crime 10-12 times. The girl tried to commit suicide. Does this show consent?"In any case, in the case of a minor, as this girl was, the law is clear that there is no issue of consent.¨She also asked the CJI to consider the effect such questions will have on the psyche of victims,The message given is that a rapist can escape jail if after the crime he “agrees” to marry his victim whether she wants to or not, she said.¨There is a prevailing retrograde social approach that the victim of rape is a 'bad' woman and if the rapist marries her, she gains respectability in the eyes of society. Comments of the apex court should not give the impression of supporting such approaches," she said.Karat said that the processes of justice must keep the interests of the rape victim at the centre. "Unfortunately in this case, the opposite has happened," she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/brinda-karat-writes-to-cji-urging-him-to-withdraw-marriage-remarks-made-at-bail-hearing-of-rape-accused-101614688540218.html

Nikita Jacob and Shantanu Muluk happen to be members of the Extinction Rebellion India chapter and his interaction with them is strictly in his capacity as liaison and in their capacity as volunteers in Extinction Rebellion, which is completely unconnected with the offences that the hypothesis of the Delhi Police alleges,” Chaudhuri’s lawyer said in his petition to the court.The petitioner pointed out that the Delhi Police has in media briefings referred to his name as a suspect in the case leading to his fear that he will be falsely arraigned as an accused in the case and arrested.“Despite the above facts, and the fact that the petitioner is not connected with the offences alleged in the FIR he apprehends that the Delhi Police intends to arrest him forcing him to file the application” the petition said.Chaudhuri, 29, has been working in Goa since August 2020 has been working for the accreditation of khazan lands as a United Nations Agricultural Heritage Site besides also volunteering with Extinction Rebellion actively involved in seeking ecologically sustainable solutions and proposing an environment oriented approach towards policy making.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/activist-in-goa-files-anticipatory-bail-plea-fearing-arrest-in-toolkit-case-101614687764842.html

02-03-2021||India||Tackle terror, prevent persecution of minorities: India tells Pakistan at UNHRC||India on Tuesday criticised Pakistan for again raising the Kashmir issue at the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC), saying the government in Islamabad had failed to tackle terrorism or prevent the “systematic persecution” of religious minorities. New Delhi’s position was conveyed in response to a speech by Pakistan’s representative at the UN human rights agency following an update on the global human rights situation by UN human rights chief Michelle Bachelet last week. Bachelet had said restrictions on communications in Jammu and Kashmir remained a concern. Pawan Badhe, first secretary in India’s permanent mission in Geneva, said Pakistan has “ignored that terrorism is the worst form of human rights abuse and the supporters of terrorism are the worst abusers of human rights”. “The members of this council are well aware that Pakistan has provided pensions to dreaded and listed terrorists out of state funds and has the dubious distinction of hosting the largest number of terrorists proscribed by the UN,” he said. Pakistani leaders had “admitted the fact that it has become a factory for producing terrorists”, he added.Also Read | Pakistan needs legislation to meet three outstanding FATF benchmarks: ReportTurning to Pakistan’s religious minorities, Badhe said: “The council should ask Pakistan why the size of its minority communities such as Christians, Hindus and Sikhs has drastically shrunk since independence and why they and other communities, such as Ahmadiyas, Shias, Pashtuns, Sindhis and Baloch, have been subjected to draconian blasphemy laws, systemic persecution, blatant abuses and forced conversions.” Holy sites of Pakistan’s religious minorities have been “attacked and vandalised daily”, he added. Enforced disappearances, extra-judicial killings and arbitrary detentions of those who speak against the security establishment are “rampant in Pakistan and have been carried out by the state’s security agencies with impunity”, Badhe said. The Indian side also pointed the recent acquittal by Pakistan’s Supreme Court of Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh, convicted for his role in the murder of journalist Daniel Pearl, and the disappearance and killings of Baloch human rights activists in other countries. Badhe said this showed that such “human rights defenders are not safe even after they leave Pakistan”. While accusing Pakistan of deliberately misusing UNHRC for “malicious propaganda against India”, Badhe said Pakistan should stop wasting the time of the council, “stop state-sponsored cross-border terrorism and end institutionalised violation of human rights of its minority and other communities”. The Indian side also rejected a reference to Jammu and Kashmir in a statement by the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) and said it has no locus standi to comment on Kashmir, which is an integral part of India. “It is regrettable that OIC continues to allow itself to be exploited by Pakistan to indulge in anti-India propaganda,” Badhe said. Following Bachelet’s update on Friday, which was also critical of raids against human rights activists in Kashmir, Pakistan’s permanent representative in Geneva, Khalil Hashmi, had criticised alleged human rights violations and demographic changes in the region. “These illegal actions are aimed at transforming the Kashmiri majority into a minority in continued defiance and violation of international law,” he had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tackle-terror-prevent-persecution-of-minorities-india-tells-pakistan-at-unhrc-101614687147861.html

Some people say that the group behind the attacks is Chinese but we don't have evidence. China will definitely deny it,” news agency ANI said quoting Singh.He also said that two teams had conducted an investigation and found “human error” to be the reason behind the power outage.“Two teams investigated the power outage and submitted that the outage was caused by human error & not due to cyber attack. One of the teams submitted that a cyber attack did happen but they were not linked to the Mumbai grid failure,” Singh told reporters.The minister acknowledged that cyber attacks were carried out on the country’s southern and northern region load dispatch centres but they were not able to reach the main operating system.Singh’s remarks comes on the heels of claims made by Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh who on Monday blamed a cyber-attack behind the power outage in Mumbai in October last year. Citing a preliminary report of the Maharashtra police’s cyber cell, Deshmukh told reporters, “Some 14 trojan horses may have been introduced in the server of the Maharashtra State Electricity Board, and data of around 8GB may have been transferred from unaccounted foreign servers.”On October 12, 2020, a grid failure resulted in massive power outage in Mumbai and its suburban areas.

This is the first symptom of downfall. The concept of self-analysis has been left aside,” he said in his address to a meeting of BJP’s Rajasthan unit. Nadda said leaders should be productive. “In politics, you have to be relevant, and this depends on your contribution to the party. The leader will have to develop the quality of taking along everyone which will increase your acceptance.”“Are we working with maturity?” asked Nadda while stressing that leaders should keep on working to enhance their relevance and acceptance. He added that one becomes a leader by actions. “The BJP is a cadre-based party, and it is our responsibility to strengthen that cadre,” he said. Nadda asked the leaders to make strong mandal units by April 6, the party’s foundation date, active booth committees by September 25 (Deen Dayal Upadhyay’s anniversary), and panna pramukhs by December 25 (Atal Bihari Vajpayee’s anniversary).Nadda hit out at the farmer leaders for doing just politics. “It is Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who thought of their welfare,” he said amid the ongoing farmer agitation against the three farm laws passed in September. He added the farm reforms introduced in September will change the fate and future of the farmers. “The Prime Minister said he is open for dialogue with food growers, but political parties and leaders are misguiding [farmers]. It is our responsibility to tell them about the reforms.”Nadda called the Congress a “frustrated lot”. “…they can promise anything to come to power but never fulfil them...” He said the Congress-ruled Rajasthan is top in crime, corruption and injustice to Dalits and women. “Congress leaders have zero knowledge about employment. Jobs would not be there till a conducive environment… who will come if such is the state of the law and order?”Nadda blamed chief minister Ashok Gehlot for misgovernance while praising Modi for effective Covid management. He added Modi saved the country by timely imposing lockdown and encouraging scientists to develop the vaccine against the disease. State BJP president Satish Poonia said the party will hold demonstrations on issues such as unemployment and loan waiver across the state from March 6 to 14.Poonia expressed confidence that the BJP will win by-polls to all four seats in the state.Congress leader Archana Sharma said Nadda’s visit was aimed to bridge the divide in BJP’s state unit. She said Nadda unnecessarily criticised the Congress despite knowing that the masses support the government. “The rift inside the BJP and among its senior leaders is evident with lawmakers writing to state chief of being neglected and other faction demanding that [Vasundhara] Raje be projected as the next chief minister.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nadda-in-rajasthan-asks-bjp-leaders-workers-to-do-a-selfanalysis-101614684687840.html
02-03-2021||India||Kangana Ranaut moves SC, seeks transfer of cases from Mumbai to Shimla||Bollywood actress Kangana Ranaut has told the Supreme Court that she does not wish to go to Mumbai as her life and property are under threat from the Maharashtra government. With her tweets and interviews inviting two police complaints and criminal proceedings against her and her sister Rangoli Chandel, the actress has moved a transfer petition in the top court to shift the criminal cases and trials to a Shimla court. The transfer petition by Ranaut and Chandel was filed in the top court on February 24 and is yet to be listed. The two have been named in separate FIRs for promoting enmity and insulting religious beliefs, registered last year at Amboli and Bandra police stations. A case against the duo is also pending on the same charges before the 66th Metropolitan Magistrate court at Andheri. In addition, Ranaut has sought the transfer of a defamation trial pending against her in an Andheri court filed by poet and lyricist Javed Akhtar. Also Read | Karnataka HC refuses to stay proceedings against Kangana RanautRanaut currently enjoys Y-plus category security of the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) granted by the Ministry of Home Affairs. “It becomes quite evident that the petitioners face serious threat to life and property and if the trial of the cases are not transferred out of Mumbai, the petitioners’ life will be at risk,” stated the petition filed by the actress through Supreme Court lawyer Neeraj Shekhar.The actress pointed out instances from which she apprehends danger to her life, including the demolition of her Pali Hill bungalow by the Shiv Sena-led Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation in September 2020. She further quoted an insulting statement issued against her by senior Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut to highlight the vitiated atmosphere for trial in the state. “These acts of the Maharashtra government clearly show that the Maharashtra government has malafide intentions against the petitioners herein and that if the petitioners visit Maharashtra to attend the said trials, there will be a constant threat to them from the Shiv Sena and Maharashtra government,” the petition stated.The sisters have invoked the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court under Section 406 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) to transfer the two FIRs and trials in two criminal cases from Maharashtra to Himachal Pradesh. The two FIRs were filed by Ali Kashif Khan Deshmukh and Munawar Ali. The first complainant had also approached the Andheri court accusing the petitioners of spreading hate, promoting enmity, and insulting religion or religious beliefs with their tweets. In one tweet, Ranaut had criticised the attack on a medical team led by doctors in Moradabad’s Nawabganj who had gone on Covid-19 duty. The second criminal case was lodged by Munawar Ali over her subsequent tweet where she criticised the Maharashtra government over handling of the Covid-19 situation.“The petitioners herein have a stellar reputation and huge fan following amongst the Indian public and are public spirited citizens,” the petition stated invoking the top court’s jurisdiction to get the matters transferred to a court in Shimla.

Choudhary accused Azad of weakening the Congress and acting on Modi’s behest. He said Azad did not come to Jammu & Kashmir for the District Development Council election campaign last year but praised Modi, who snatched the region’s statehood.Angry workers from the Youth Congress and National Students’ Union of India, the party’s student wing, demanded Azad’s removal from the party at the protest.Also Read | Cong’s Ghulam Nabi Azad hails PM Modi for ‘not forgetting roots’Ghulam Ahmad Mir, the chief of Congress in Jammu & Kashmir, said theirs is a big party and every individual analyses things as per her understanding. “He [Choudhary] is certainly general secretary...but in a democracy, everyone has the right to express his or her opinion or resentment.”On Sunday, Azad praised Modi for not forgetting his roots despite becoming the Prime Minister and asked his audience to learn from him about how one remains grounded.

There is a huge amount of scope to study the impact of vaccines, which needs to be thought-through by a very coordinated approach," she said.As many as 30 vaccines are at different stages of development in India. Covaxin, developed indigenously by Biotech, and Covishield, developed by Oxford-AstraZeneca and being manufactured at Serum Institute of India, are already in use in the country.The vaccine candidates of Zydus Cadila and Russia's Sputnik V are in phase 3 of the human clinical trials. Sputnik V, which is being manufactured by Reddy's Laboratories in India, has initiated the process for Emergency Use Authorisation (EUA) with the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI).India has supplied vaccines to several nations while many others have also placed orders for the same.Vinod Paul, Member (Health), NITI Aayog lauded the efforts of scientific community and said the speed with which the solutions during the pandemic appeared was phenomenal.“The stories of development of vaccines are amazing examples of how time can be compressed and scientific mobilisation can be initiated.

02-03-2021||India||Insurgency-related incidents dipped by 80% in N-E states last year: MHA data||Insurgency-related incidents in the northeastern (N-E) states dipped by 80% and civilian deaths by 99% last year compared to 2014, according to the Union home ministry data. The civilian deaths were in single digits (two) in 2020 for the first time since 1999. The deaths of security forces’ personnel also came down by 75%.The insurgency peaked in the region in 2000 when 1,923 incidents related to it were reported. The number came down to 162 in 2020 compared to 824 in 2014 when 212 deaths were reported. The highest number of civilian killings (907) in the region was also reported in 2000.In 1999, 208 security forces’ personnel lost their lives fighting insurgents in the region. Five deaths of security personnel were reported in 2020 compared to 20 in 2014.The highest--2,644--number of insurgents belonging to various outfits surrendered to security forces in 2020. Prior to this, the highest number of surrenders was in 2000 when 1,962 militants gave up arms. About 1,824 insurgents have surrendered from 2014 to 2019.Also Read | 2 years of Pulwama terror attack: The day when India lost 40 CRPF menThe data suggest that insurgency has reduced drastically, particularly since 2015, a year after the National Democratic Alliance government came to power at the Centre.G Kishan Reddy, Union minister of state (home affairs), informed Parliament in March last year that there was a 70% reduction in violence in the region in 2019.A ministry official, who did not wish to be named, said the 80% reduction in insurgency-related incidents and rise in the number of insurgents giving up arms by over 1600% from 2019 is further improvement and a great achievement for the government and security forces. “Because of the improvement in the security situation, the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act, 1958, has been removed completely from Meghalaya and Tripura and its application has been reduced in Arunachal Pradesh,” the official said.“Overall, the security situation in Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, and Tripura has improved to a satisfactory level.”All four factions of the National Democratic Front of Bodoland (NDFB) disbanded themselves last year 34 years after it was formed to seek a separate Bodoland state from Assam. This came following the signing of a memorandum of settlement of the outfits with the Centre in January. Following the settlement, 1,615 NDFB members surrendered in January 2020.Experts and officials said almost all major insurgent groups, including the National Socialist Council of Nagaland (NSCN) and its factions, have signed ceasefire agreements with the government. They added regional diplomatic cooperation between India and neighbouring countries including Bangladesh, Bhutan and Myanmar have denied insurgents safe havens. These factors along with economic development in the region and movement of people to the mainland for job opportunities have also resulted in the dip in violence.Subir Bhaumik, a former BBC journalist and analyst, said Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s return to power in Bangladesh in 2009 was the game-changer for the insurgency. “Earlier, all the insurgent groups had safe havens there. Sheikh Hasina made sure that Bangladesh’s soil is not used by the extremists and their leaders were handed over to India...the Myanmar army is now backing India against insurgents because it needs the Indian help in fighting [its insurgent group] the Arakan Army.”Bhaumik said the main armed movement– NSCN-Isaac Muivaah--and all its factions are now involved in peace talks. “Nagas not fighting the government is the primary reason for the significant reduction in incidents. More importantly, the Indian economy and its growth have proved to be a magnet of opportunities for the younger generation in the Northeast. The basic attraction for joining the underground [groups] is now gone,” he said. Bhaumik added younger people from the region are now moving to Delhi, Mumbai, Pune, Bengaluru for work. “People of the Northeast have shunned the insurgent groups. There is a strong sentiment against rebel action. In fact, there are more recruitment rallies for the Indian army in the Northeast than probably in Punjab and other regions.”Pushpita Das, a research fellow at New Delhi’s Manohar Parrikar Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses, echoed Bhaumik. “Major insurgent groups are engaged in peace talks and this has raised hopes that there will be all-round peace and development in the region. A lot of development push has gone into the [the region] in the last several years and large scale migration of youth from the Northeast to the mainland has also played a role in reducing the recruitment pool for insurgent groups.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/80-reduction-in-insurgency-related-incidents-in-n-e-states-last-year-mha-data-101614676827488.html

02-03-2021||India||Unemployment high in India due to government's 'ill considered demonetisation decision': Manmohan Singh||Attacking the Centre, former Prime Minister Dr Manmohan Singh on Tuesday said unemployment is high in the country and its informal sector is in shambles following the "ill considered demonetisation decision" taken by the BJP-led government in 2016. He also criticised the central government for not holding regular consultations with the states. Inaugurating a development summit virtually organised by the Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Development Studies, an economic think tank aligned to the Congress ideology in poll-bound Kerala, Singh said temporary measures by the Government of India and the Reserve Bank to paper over the credit problem cannot blind us to the looming credit crisis ahead that could affect the small and medium sector. "Unemployment is high and the informal sector is in shambles, a crisis precipitated by the ill considered demonetisation decision taken in 2016", he said at "Pratheeksha 2030." The summit was organised to launch a Vision Document, a framework of ideas for development of Kerala well in advance of the state elections. He said in Kerala and in many other states, public finances are in disarray with states having to resort to excessive borrowing, which creates an intolerable burden on future budgets. "Federalism and regular consultation with states, which was the cornerstone of Indias economic and political philosophy as enshrined in the Constitution, no longer finds favour with the present Central government," he said. Singh said while Kerala's social standards are high, there are other sectors that need strong attention in the future. "There are many roadblocks ahead that the state has to overcome. The global downturn of the last two or three years, aggravated by the pandemic, has made the global interface of Kerala more fragile. "While the increased use of digital modes of work may keep the IT sector afloat, tourism has been hit badly and the rate at which the pandemic is galloping in Kerala poses challenges for this industry", Singh said. Noting that the focus on health and education has enabled Kerala to take advantage of job opportunities elsewhere in the country and in all parts of the world, Singh said this has led to a growing stream of remittances from abroad which created a booming real estate sector and sharp growth of the services sector, led by tourism and information technology. "In the midst of all the gloom, I see the UDF's steadfast adherence to planned growth with a clear sense of direction and concern for the common man a beacon of hope, not only for Kerala, but for the whole country", he said. "When I presented the national budget in 1991 as Finance Minister, I quoted Victor Hugo, who had said, "Nothing is more powerful than an idea whose time has come." I get the feeling that the unanimity and clarity displayed by the UDF on the road ahead will lead to Kerala's idea moment arriving this year", he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/unemployment-high-in-india-due-to-government-s-ill-considered-demonetisation-decision-manmohan-singh-101614674381644.html

But transgender people often face serious discrimination and mistreatment at work, school, and in their families and communities,” the plea has claimed.It said transgenders faces stigma and discrimination and get fewer opportunities as compared to others.Referring to the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act 2019, the plea said Parliament had passed the bill to protect transgender rights but the new law is “inadequate on several fronts”.The plea alleged that living conditions of transgenders are very poor and that majority of them are living in rented accommodations.It said that as per a 2017 report of the National Human Rights Commission, 79 per cent of transgenders either live in rented rooms or share accommodations with others and 52.61 per cent have monthly income below ₹10,000.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/plea-in-sc-seeks-a-transgender-welfare-board-to-address-social-welfare-issues-101614673645433.html

02-03-2021||India||Cong’s new campaign style: Dance, push-ups and deep sea diving||The distance between Lakhimpur in north eastern Assam and India’s southern tip of Kanyakumari is more than 3,000 kms. But on Monday, the two corners saw a similar political portrait: Congress leader Rahul Gandhi in Kanyakumari and his sister party general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra in Assam, breaking into a dance with the locals. On Tuesday, Priyanka followed it up by plucking tea leaves in Sadhuru tea garden at Biswanath district, connecting with a key vote bank in the populous north-eastern state going to three-phase polls from March 27. Rahul, the top campaigner for the party in this round of assembly election in four states and a UT, too, came up with new ideas to reach out to the people. He joined the students of St. Joseph’s Matriculation Higher Secondary School in Mulagumudu of Kanyakumari in their dance. Then, he accepted a push-up challenge by Merolin Shenigha, a student who is also a Judo enthusiast. Rahul, trained in Japanese martial art Aikido, did a bonus stunt of push-up with one hand to the thunderous applause of the students who came to meet him on a Sunday morning. A few days ago, in Kerala, he dived into the sea along with some fishermen and helped a group of villagers cook mushroom biryani in Tamil Nadu. He did it earlier too, when he joined MGNREGS workers in UP in their work when the UPA was in power. Also Read | West Bengal: How the Left diluted its own politics to try and outmanoeuvre TMCAll these antics are part of what is seen as a new-age Congress campaign with top leaders eager to break the barrier between them and the public. No more confined to addressing large meetings or road shows, Gandhis make it a more personal appearance and an engaging, direct interaction with their audience. History of such engagements, of course, goes back to the days of Indira Gandhi when she would climb the barriers and freely interact with rural women frequently during her Prime Ministerial days. Or, when Rajiv Gandhi would drive his own jeep on dirt roads and meet people. The BJP and other parties too, have come up with such plans to add a dash of personal touch in their political progammes. Sharing a meal with a villager, spending a night in a village or riding pillion with an aam admi, are all parts of a changing canvas of political propaganda.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congs-new-campaign-style-dance-push-ups-and-deep-sea-diving-101614673347158.html

The deceased were identified as Manoj Mittal (38) Mahbub Alam (31) Anchal Singh (21) and Rekha (21).“Preliminary inquiry revealed that they were all from Delhi and were staying in North Bengaluru.

02-03-2021||India||Kerala strike against rising fuel prices hits normal life||A strike called by various trade unions to protest the recurring fuel price hike affected normal life in poll-bound Kerala on Tuesday with public transport remaining off the roads and most of the shops remaining shut. Though private vehicles were allowed to ply, many kept off the roads; and in some areas a virtual shutdown was witnessed. Except the Bhartiya Mazdoor Sangh (BMS) all trade unions were supporting the dawn to dusk strike.In view of the strike, various examinations scheduled for the day were postponed. The government and private buses, taxis, autos and trucks suspended their services and shops that opened, later pulled down their shutters. In a joint statement, protesting trade unions said rising fuel prices were making operation of goods and passenger vehicles costlier and many employees were rendered jobless.Continuously rising fuel prices have become a major political issue with the opposition accusing the BJP led Central government of being insensitive to common man’s woes by refusing to slash high central taxes levied on Petrol and Diesel, however, the Centre has passed the buck to the states, asking them to cut down high state taxes levied on fuel to bring down the price. Petrol and Diesel prices have been rising continuously due to improved demand of crude oil in the international market, renewed hope due to launch of Coronavirus vaccines and low production. While prices of fuel in India have been deregulated subjecting them to near-daily fluctuations in the international market, more than half of its price in the country is composed of taxes levied by the Centre and the states. The Central government has accepted that the rising prices are a vexatious issue, however, it has also indicated that a reduction in Central taxes could negatively impact the revenue targets.Also Read: 'Metro man' E Sreedharan's entry triggers steady flow of bigwigs to party: BJPEarlier, the Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) requested the state government for a cut in state taxes to bring down fuel prices to ease the burden on the common man but the state finance minister, Thomas Iassac, ruled it out saying a reduction in state-levied taxes on fuel will cripple revenue flow to the state exchequer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-strike-against-rising-fuel-prices-hits-normal-life-101614668968868.html
02-03-2021||India||Hash constant: Govt’s solution to tracing originator of viral messages||Significant social media intermediaries can comply with the government’s norm for disclosing the originator of viral messages by assigning each message a unique mathematical value that can be traced to their creators, an official familiar with the matter said even as the chorus against the new rules for digital media escalates. The value is called the hash constant or the hash value. The value changes at the slightest alteration of the original message, say with the insertion of even a comma or a full stop, leading to a new originator being created.Significant social media intermediaries are the ones that have over five million users, according to the new online media rules. The Centre last Thursday notified the rules that will govern online content. The rules include allowing users to dispute action taken against them by social media intermediaries such as Facebook and Twitter and setting up a three-tier self-regulatory framework for so-called over the top platforms such as Amazon Prime, Netflix and Hotstar, and online news media entities.Also Read | Centre announces rules for OTT, digital mediaMost end-to-end encrypted messaging applications, such as WhatsApp, Signal, and Telegram, fall in the significant social media category. They have 90 days to comply with the extra due diligence rules.“The hash constant is barely 1 kb and will take up not more than 1% of the memory of the messaging application,” said a second official, on the condition of anonymity. The official added the government would already have identified the text of the message, so at no point will the messaging company have to violate the encryption. “All we are saying is store the hash, identify it for a particular message and tell us the originator for the same as the value is constant,” the official said. “We do not even want to know who all the message was forwarded to.”The official added the ambit under which a judicial or competent authority order can be exercised is very clearly laid out in the rules. They include a threat to sovereignty, integrity of India, the security of the state, friendly relations with foreign states, or public order, or of incitement to an offence relating to them or in relation with rape, sexually explicit material or child sexual abuse material, punishable with imprisonment for a term of not less than five years. The official said the rules also state that no order shall be passed in cases where other less intrusive means are effective in identifying the originator of the information.A person familiar with Signal’s policies said that the company is completely open-source and collects no data. “The policy being requested by the government will lead to breaking end-to-end encryption,” the person said. “It seems India is moving towards controlling the internet the same way China does, or even worse–Iran.”Signal has been designed to minimise the data it retains about users. “...the only information we can produce in response to a request like this is the date and time a user registered with Signal and the last date of a user’s connectivity to the Signal service,” it said in response to a grand jury subpoena for Signal user data in the US in 2016. “Notably, things we do not have stored include anything about a user’s contacts (such as the contacts themselves, a hash of the contacts, any other derivative contact information), anything about a user’s groups (such as how many groups a user is in, which groups a user is in, the membership lists of a user’s groups), or any records of who a user has been communicating with.” The company emphasised all message contents are end-to-end encrypted, and they do not have that information either.WhatsApp, too, is involved in a case in the Madras High Court, where it has been suggested that originator information be attached to every message. “But that is not possible as the... protocol... WhatsApp uses for end-to-end encryption as well provides for cryptographic deniability,” said a person familiar with WhatsApp’s policy.The person added the meta-data that WhatsApp collects is shared with law enforcement agencies. In its affidavit filed in the high court, WhatsApp said it is unable to comply with providing originator information as it does not store it. It is unable to search for and view messages exchanged on its platform, it added.Anand Venkatanarayanan, disinformation, cyber weapons and data security researcher, said there is simply no way to comply with the guidelines without breaking end-to-end encryption. “At the heart of E2E [end-to-end encryption] is the Diffie–Hellman algorithm, which allows shared encryption keys to be generated by two parties by exchanging their public keys,” Venkatanarayanan said. “...these keys are not static but change for every new message sent out. This scheme allows anyone to forge an entire transcript with anyone, thus rendering any attempt to add originator information into the E2E protocol dead on arrival. Hence, the only way to comply with the guidelines is to break E2E.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hash-constant-govt-s-solution-to-tracing-originator-of-viral-messages-101614667706841.html

02-03-2021||India||Lok Sabha, Rajya Sabha channels merged to create new platform, Sansad TV||Indian Parliament integrated its two TV channels for the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha to create Sansad TV—a new platform that will continue to live telecast house proceedings and also pack news and current affairs programme in Hindi and English. Officials said that the Rajya Sabha TV establishment—that runs from a rented public property adjacent to the Talkatora stadium, will be merged with the LSTV’s infrastructure to create the new entity. Former textiles secretary Ravi Kapoor has been appointed as the CEO of the new entity for a period of one year on a contract basis, an internal order of the Lok Sabha secretariat said. The plan was proposed by an expert committee headed by Prasar Bharati CEO Surya Prakash in 2019 and aims at cutting costs, streamlining management of the channel and rejig the content to make it a more attractive product for viewers and advertisers. Both Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha TV were profit-making entities and the channels bagged advertisements primarily from public sector giants and central ministries. According to the new plan, Sansad TV will have two platforms or channels to ensure smooth telecast of live proceedings of the two Houses of Parliament. “During the recess, the options would be to run current affairs channels in English and Hindi or just shut down one channel and run programmes on the other,” said a senior official involved in the plan. “The integrated plan would be a major cost-saving exercise as the RSTV shells out ₹10-12 crore on rent alone for its office and studio on the Talkatora Road,” said a senior official of the Rajya Sabha. The new address for the Sansad TV will be a small bungalow at Mahadev Road that also houses kennel for eight sniffer dogs of the Parliament security service. The Lok Sabha TV also has a studio in the Parliament library building and a feed centre on the first floor of Parliament building. These existing infrastructures would be enough, officials believe, to run Sansad TV.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lok-sabha-rajya-sabha-channels-merged-to-create-new-platform-sansad-tv-101614665667181.html

02-03-2021||India||Separate depart for Odisha SHGs as their growth continues under Naveen Patnaik||Odisha government is planning to make a separate department to administer the self help groups (SHGs) like Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Telangana Andhra Pradesh and West Bengal, two decades after their inception, by dividing the SHGs into cluster level, gram panchayat level, block level, district level and finally a state level federation, said officials."The unified structure would go a long way in strengthening the SHG initiatives and provide greater focus, synergy and help utilise the manpower and resources in a more organised manner," said a senior state government official. The department would be headed by a secretary and there could be a separate minister for it.The plan to make a separate department for the SHGs came in the backdrop of a recent government decision asking them to collect property tax and holding taxes in state's urban local bodies, where there were less number of officials to collect the dues.In Bhubaneswar municipal corporation, the largest urban local body in the state with a million plus population, there were at least 804 big defaulters of property and holding tax. Till January, BMC could only collect property/holding tax of ₹24 crore out of the ₹90 crore target for 2020-21. The state housing and urban development department now hopes to meet the target by handing over the job of collection of arrears and current tax dues to the SHGs."The main objective of the exercise was to achieve full and complete coverage of all assesses in respect of property Tax/holding Tax and other taxes by involving SHGs. We are engaging the SHGs in urban local bodies where each tax collector has to handle more than 1000 cases a year. The department would pay anything between 2 to 3% of the collection as commission to the SHGs," said a senior official of the housing and urban development department."The move to give more work to the SHGs would definitely add to their confidence and provide more money in their hands. It's a concrete step towards women empowerment and in line with chief minister Naveen Patnaik's faith in women of Odisha carving a separate niche in the society," said Pratap Deb, spokesman of Biju Janata Dal.Though the women SHGs existed in Odisha in 90s, they got a separate identity when Biju Janata Dal under Naveen Patnaik rode to power in 2000. A year after becoming CM, Patnaik started Mission Shakti programme and began formation of these SHGs with the objective of organising women into groups for holistic empowerment and targeted livelihood activities. Today, there are a little over 6 lakh SHGs in Odisha under Mission Shakti with 70 lakh members. In April 2017, a separate directorate of Mission Shakti was created under the Women & Child Development Department.These SHGs take loans from banks and provide small loans to members; make packaged ready-to-eat fortified power food for children in anganwadi centres and look after the mid-day meal schemes of state's schools. This financial year, at least 2 lakh SHGs were given credit linkages worth ₹3411 crore. For SHG groups that take loans up to ₹3 lakh from banks and repay it on time, the state government takes care of the interest payment.Apart from providing small loans to the members, these SHGs are also engaged in a variety of works including collection of power tariff from consumers. A little more than a year ago, the government tied up with Amazon and Flipkart to help the SHG members gain access to a bigger market. An exclusive Mission Shakti e-commerce portal is also being developed in collaboration with the Tata Trusts to market women SHG products online. In May 2019, the Naveen Patnaik government approved provisioning of services and goods for different government departments through Mission Shakti, which would provide direct business worth ₹1000 crore to the SHGs every year.Last year during Covid 19, SHG groups in urban areas were engaged as implementing partners under the Urban Wage Employment Initiative. The scheme, now renamed as Mukhyamantri Karma Tatpara Abhiyan, helped urban women in slums and poor households earn through desilting of drains, construction of rain water harvesting structures, plantations, recycling and reuse of waste, beautification of city through wall painting and murals. Around 7000 SHGs were engaged as implementing partners in execution of work with contract value/wage component amounting to ₹62.08 crore.Apart from this, around 400 SHGs manufactured over 3.3 million masks for distribution among people last year. During the Covid-19 lockdown, when dry ration and vegetable shops were shut in rural Odisha, these groups distributed more than 9 million cooked meals through the free kitchen centres managed by them in Odisha's gram panchayats.Political science professor of GM University, Sambalpur, Gyana Ranjan Swain said it is remarkable the way Naveen Patnaik has built a core constituency for his party through SHGs. "In any election, the electorate are vulnerable to money and muscle power. Yet in Odisha, these women have stood rock-solid behind BJD due to the SHG movement. It's a win-win strategy for both BJD and rural women as the SHG groups empower rural women and Naveen Patnaik is assured of a committed vote base. I don't think there are any other committed vote banks of any political party in India as SHG groups in Odisha," said Swain. To show his commitment towards the SHGs, Patnaik in 2019 nominated SHG leader Pramila Bisoyi to contest from Aska Lok Sabha constituency, which he first represented after joining politics in 1997.Also Read: Odisha acid-attack survivor marries long-time friend, recalls journeyThe growth of SHGs in Odisha over the last 20 years is also matched by the rising participation of women in elections. In 2000, when Naveen Patnaik was first elected as CM, only 55.6 % of the women electorate cast their votes as against 63.8% men voters. In 2019 polls, close to 75% of the women electorate cast their votes as against 71% men. "Though there is no empirical evidence to show how many of these women voted for the BJD, we can surmise that most of the women must have voted for BJD," said Panchanan Kanungo, former finance minister of Odisha.Professor of sociology of Utkal University, Navaneeta Rath said one needs to study how the SHG movement has changed the entrepreneurship model in rural Odisha. "Traditionally women in Odisha are not considered to be worthwhile in households. But the SHG movement has altered the power balance in Odisha society. Now they are being taken seriously due to their financial muscle," said Rath.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/separate-depart-for-odisha-shgs-as-their-growth-continues-under-naveen-patnaik-101614661264590.html

While leaders are pointing guns and taking pot-shots at the decisions of the party, the party high command is assessing the situation,According to sources, the party high command is dealing with the situation with care so that no wrong message goes to the party cadre. The top leadership is not in a mood to take action against senior leaders who gathered at the event of Gandhi Global Family in Jammu and has not sought for an explanation from them for their remarks. It is easy to understand that the top leadership is avoiding any kind of public embarrassment."Planning of a rally is underway in Kurukshetra district. Though it is yet to be finalised under which banner it would be held, G-23 leaders are not in a mood to normalise the tension building up after group opened a front in Jammu in which leaders like Anand Sharma, Kapil Sibal, Manish Tiwari, Raj Babbar, Bhupinder Singh Hooda said that the party is getting weak which is weakening the opposition too. Sibal had advocated for Azad, saying, "We do not know why the party is not using the experience of Gulam Nabi Azad."In response, party spokesperson Abhishek Manu Singhvi said from the forum: "It would have been better if they helped the Congress in five poll-bound states. These are respected leaders and we respect them."The leader said: "The one who has used the term 'used' does not know the legacy of the party. The man about whom the word has been used has been a Congress MP seven times."Soniaji made him the Chief Minister. Indiraji bestowed cabinet berth in central government. He has been general secretary in party and has exercised supervision over 20 states across the nation," the leader said.A senior leader in the group, who wrote a letter to Sonia Gandhi and was present at the Gandhi Global Family Function in Jammu, told ANI that no one from the AICC contacted them after the programme and "We are being advised to work for the Congress in poll-bound states but we have not been made a star campaigner by the party. If we go for campaigning it will included in the expense of a candidate and we have not been contacted and assigned any task but we will continue to raise our voices to strengthen the party and we will go the other states too."Even on Monday the crisis went on to next level when senior leader of Congress raised questions about party's Alliance with Indian Secular Front (ISF). Anand Sharma tweeted that "Congress' alliance with parties like ISF and other such forces militates against the core ideology of the party and Gandhian and Nehruvian secularism, which forms the soul of the party. These issues need to be approved by the CWC. Congress cannot be selective in fighting communalists but must do so in all its manifestations, irrespective of religion and colour. The presence and endorsement by West Bengal PCC president is painful and shameful. He must clarify."After that AICC Incharge of West Bengal Jitin Prasad wrote on Twitter, "Alliance decisions are taken keeping in mind the best interests of the party and the workers. Now is the time for everyone to join hands and work towards strengthening the prospects of the Congress in the poll bound states. @INCIndia @rssurjewala @adhirrcinc @AnandSharmaINC."While West Bengal PCC Chief and Leader of the Party in Lok Sabha Adhir Ranjan Chaudhary tweeted that "Know ur facts @AnandSharmaINC ji CPI(M) led Left Front is leading the secular alliance in West Bengal of which Congress is an integral part.

02-03-2021||India||Bihar police books landowners for illegal opium cultivation to check the menace||Bihar police have begun lodging FIRs against the original landowners, whose lands are being used for cultivation of opium, in a crackdown on the illegal farming and trade of the contraband. So far, cases against 18 landowners in Gaya and two in Jamui have been filed for letting use of farms for cultivation of opium.The forested and hilly areas of Gaya, Jamui and Nawada in Bihar became notorious for illegal opium cultivation over the past two decades since authorities failed in effective action. The periodic destruction of crops and lodging of cases against those engaged in cultivation of opium while sparing the landowners, did little to stem the thriving trade and the contraband crop kept resurfacing on the same fields.Experts, however, remain sceptical if the new approach will be able to uproot the illegal trade considering the growing scale of opium production, called ‘afim’ locally. They also ask if the law can be enforced in areas where anti-government militias are active and when even politicians are alleged to be involved in the drug trade.Officials in the Bihar police headquarters claim Maoist sympathizers are engaged in opium farming in land located near the Jharkhand border, which can’t be accessed through motor able roads. “Locate crops using drones and satellite images by separate teams of central reserve police force (CRPF), Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB), narcotics control bureau (NCB) and destroy them right before they get ready for harvesting,” an official said, suggesting a way to tackle the menace.The official quoted above noted other reasons for the trade to flourish. He said lack of employment and quality education in these areas and limited infrastructure drove people to this. He said since most of the illegal farming is done on forest department land, identification of the real grower becomes difficult.Gaya SSP Aditya Kumar said all previous cases were of possession or seizure of illicit opium and other drugs. This was the first-time that cases were filed against illegal opium farming. People are growing opium as a cash crop to make fast and easy money, he added.Confirming that the police had recently destroyed opium crops, the SSP said Maoists have raised opium in over 500 acres of land in Barachatti, Dhangai, Dobhi and Mohanpur area. The operation will continue till the last opium plant was uprooted, he added.Police said that besides extortion, earnings from narcotics remain an important source of Maoist funding. The money thus gained is spent on procurement of weapons and maintenance of the People’s Liberation Guerrilla Army, the armed wing of the CPI (Maoist).In Jamui, a joint team of CRPF, NCB and district police destroyed the standing opium crop in five acres of land in Chakai police station area of the district.Also Read: RJD's Tejashwi Yadav meets Bengal CM Mamata, extends support to TMCJamui SP Pramod Kumar Mandal said two separate FIRs have been lodged against the landowners. “The sowing of poppy crops begins in November while the harvesting takes place mid-March. The crops are generally grown on fields located beside rivers and in deep forests in order to avoid detection,” he added.According to the officials of SSB Frontier headquarters, Patna, the security personnel have so far destroyed a maximum of about 325 acres of opium crop in Gaya, followed by Jamui and Khunti in Jharkhand since January 1, 2021.A senior CRPF official pointed out that each poppy crop destruction effort is classified as a special operation because of the risks involved. “There are times when the forces have to think hard about entering the fields because there could be an ambush waiting for them”, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bihar-police-books-landowners-for-illegal-opium-cultivation-to-check-the-menace-101614656810580.html

Here is all you need to know about the disclosure:• It fuelled speculation that a blackout in Mumbai last year may have been the result of sabotage.• First reported by the New York Times on Monday, security consultancy Recorded Future said the attackers (which it calls RedEcho) targeted at least “10 distinct power sector organisations” with malware known as ShadowPad.• Hours after the disclosure, the Union power ministry said it had received inputs from Indian agencies — first in November and then again in February this year — about the threat of infection from ShadowPad, prompting remedial measures.• The ministry said no data breach or data loss has been detected due to these incidents.• The ministry’s statement appeared to suggest that the attacks were not behind the October 12, 2020, power outage in Mumbai that had lasted up to 12 hours in some parts of India’s financial capital, bringing the city’s local trains to a halt and forcing the airport to switch to back-up supply.Also Read | No data breach in Chinese hacking attempt at power grid system, says govt• Recorded Future’s Insikt Group, the cyber threat intelligence division, also referred to the Mumbai blackout but said it did not have forensics evidence to link the incident to the China-linked campaign.• In Maharashtra, state home minister Anil Deshmukh said on Monday the state police suspect a cyber-attack to be the reason for the power cut in Mumbai.• Some 14 trojan horses may have introduced in the server of the Maharashtra State Electricity Board, data of around 8GB may have transferred from unaccounted foreign servers, similarly, the login may have been made by blacklisted IP addresses in the MSEB server, Deshmukh said.• He cited the preliminary probe of the cyber police following analysis of the supervisory control and data acquisition networks.• Deshmukh did not give details about what malware was used or the identity of the attackers.• The disclosures of the attempts of sabotage of critical infrastructure by Chinese operatives point to the possibility of an unprecedented escalation of conflict between India and China in cyberspace.• The two countries had a bitter border confrontation, including the first fatal clash between their troops in decades, last year. • The two sides have since stepped back from the border stand-off.• According to Recorded Future’s Insikt Group, the campaign targeted “a large swathe of India’s power sector” and shares the same digital infrastructure and left similar footprints as other Chinese actors, which, too, use ShadowPad, a modular backdoor malware that can hand attackers full control over a computer system.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chinalinked-attackers-target-india-s-power-infra-what-you-need-to-know-101614656966399.html

The notices will help the UK authorities to arrest the three for India to begin their extradition process.HT has seen the notices issued by the international police organisation, which say Hajra Memon and Junaid Memon are Indian nationals while Asif Iqbal Memon is a British citizen. They fled to London from the UAE when the Enforcement Directorate (ED) launched an investigation against them for allegedly using drug money to acquire properties across the world.The notices were issued days after a Mumbai court on Friday declared the three fugitive economic offenders and ordered the seizure of their properties in India and abroad. The declaration will help in the deportation of the three and stop their financial activities abroad.The ED has accused the three of running a drug syndicate after Iqbal Mirchi’s death in London in 2013 and amassing properties in India and abroad.Mirchi was alleged to be a henchman of global terrorist Dawood Ibrahim and allegedly involved in drug trafficking and extortion. According to the ED, Mirchi indirectly owned properties in and around Mumbai. ED attached the family’s properties worth ₹798 crore, including a farmhouse, two bungalows, and 3.5-acre land in Panchgani in 2020. It filed a money laundering case against the family in 2019 linked to their alleged illegal dealings in the purchase and sale of real estate in Mumbai.A charge sheet was filed against the family before the Mumbai court in December 2019 and the ED issued open-ended non-bailable warrants against Mirchi’s sons and widow.HT was unable to reach the family’s lawyers for comments. Nobody represented them in the court on Friday.A UK court on Thursday last cleared diamantaire Nirav Modi’s extradition to India as it found him guilty of fraud and money laundering in the Punjab National Bank. The court dismissed Modi’s claims that he would not get a fair trial at home three years after he fled India in January 2018 after siphoning off around ₹6,498 crore. Modi’s case has been sent to UK home secretary Priti Patel to decide whether to order his extradition to India.India last year secured the extradition of former liquor baron Vijay Mallya. But his extradition has been held up due to secret legal proceedings. Mallya is learnt to have applied for asylum in the UK.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/interpol-notices-against-iqbal-mirchi-s-wife-two-sons-101614647191476.html

02-03-2021||India||Covid vaccine: Mallikarjun Kharge says he's old; 'I don't need,' says Anil Vij||As the second phase of vaccination where people above 60 years of age and 45+ with comorbidities will get vaccinated began from March 1, many politicians, ministers are eligible on age ground. Vice president Venkaiah Naidu, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Union home minister Amit Shah, external affairs minister S Jaishankar got vaccinated on the first day. Odisha Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik, Bihar CM Nitish Kumar also got vaccinated on Monday.On the question of getting vaccinated, the Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha, Mallikarjun Kharge said he thinks the priority should be youngsters who have a long life ahead. "I am above 70 years of age. You should give the COVID-19 vaccine to youngsters and increase the longevity of their life. I merely have 10 to 15 more years to live, Youngsters have a long life to live. I will also take the vaccine," the veteran Congress leader said.It is believed that MPs — half of the total number of MPS eligible for vaccine — will be vaccinated before Parliament resumes on March 8.Of the 777 MPs India currently has, 366 are above the age of 60, meeting the criteria of those who can be vaccinated in the current phase.Haryana health minister Anil Vij on Monday said he does not need the vaccine as his antibody count went up to 300 after he contracted Covid-19 in December. In November, he was administered one dose of Covaxin, as part of the third phase trial. In December, he contracted the infection and was hospitalised.आज आम जनता के लिए कोरोना वैक्सीन शुरू होने जा रही है । सब को निस्संकोच लगवानी चाहिए । मैं तो नही लगवा पाऊंगा क्योंकि कोविड होने के बाद मेरी एंटीबाडी 300 बनी है जोकि बहुत ज्यादा है । शायद मैंने जो ट्रायल वैक्सीन लगवाई थी इसमे उसका भी योगदान हो । मुझे अभी वैक्सीन की जरूरत नही है ।"Today corona vaccine is starting for the people. Now there should be no hesitation at all. I will not be able to receive a dose as after a Covid infection, my antibody count is 300 which is a lot. Maybe the trial vaccine I had taken had a role in that. I don't need vaccine right now," the 66-year-old minister tweeted in Hindi.Union health ministry, however, has emphasised that those who have already contracted the infection once should take the vaccine.(With Agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-vaccine-mallikarjun-kharge-says-he-s-old-i-don-t-need-says-anil-vij-101614652780505.html

02-03-2021||India||SC dismisses PIL to clip Centre's power on IPS transfers||The Supreme Court on Monday refused to hear a petition challenging Centre’s power as the cadre-controlling authority to override states on matters of transfer and deputation of police officers in the backdrop of the row over Centre’s December order to transfer out three senior cops from West Bengal following a breach in security of BJP national president JP Nadda, whose cavalcade was attacked on the way to a public meeting at Diamond Harbour in the state.A West Bengal-based lawyer Abu Sohel filed the petition in public interest challenging the authority of the Centre to transfer police officers out of a state without the state government’s consent. The provision under challenge was Rule 6(1) of the Indian Police Service (Cadre) Rules, 1954.A bench of justices L Nageswara Rao and S Ravindra Bhatt was not keen to entertain the petition and dismissed the matter without hearing arguments on merits.Sohel questioned the rule in the light of constitutional freedoms, in particular the right to equality (Article 14), arguing that the provision provides ‘arbitrary’ discretion in the hands of the Centre and allegedly also impacts the right to dignity of the officers concerned.The Rule 6(1) provides that a “cadre officer may, with the concurrence of the state government or the state governments concerned and the Central government, be deputed for service under the central government or another state government….provided that in case of any disagreement, the matter shall be decided by the Central government and the state government or state governments concerned shall give effect to the decision of the Central government.”Also Read: TMC govt, CBI set for another face-off in Supreme CourtSohel’s petition said, “Arbitrary action by the Central government by virtue of the impugned Rule ultimately plays havoc with the right of officers to live a dignified life as guaranteed (by the Constitution).” Further, it claimed that the rule in question created “unjustifiable and illegal deviation” from the original intent of the framers of the Constitution to create harmony between the Centre and the states.The petition cited a similar instance from the year 2001, where the decision of the Centre to recall three Indian Police Service (IPS) officers from Tamil Nadu led to an ugly spat between the state government and the Centre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-dismisses-pil-to-clip-centre-s-power-on-ips-transfers-101614651028530.html

02-03-2021||India||TMC govt, CBI set for another face-off in Supreme Court||The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and the West Bengal government are set to have yet another face off in the Supreme Court over the agency’s authority to carry out investigations in the state, a battle that reprises one that the two fought around two years ago in the Saradha chit fund case, and which comes ahead of the assembly elections.On Monday, the state’s Mamata Banerjee-led Trinamool Congress (TMC) government filed a petition in the top court challenging CBI’s power to register a coal smuggling case, pointing out that the state government withdrew the general consent to the central investigation agency to conduct investigations within the state as far back as November 2018.Rujira Banerjee, the wife of TMC MP Abhishek Banerjee has been questioned by the central agency in connection with the case. Abhishek is also a nephew of the chief minister.The state’s petition requests the court to stay the probe in the case until the validity of CBI’s FIR is finally decided.The TMC and the Bharatiya Janata Party (which heads the Union government) are in the midst of a bitter electoral battle which has been marked by high-intensity campaigning, incidents of violence and alleged political killings and assaults, and a spate of defections.In its petition, the state said CBI could not assume jurisdiction to probe just because the case involved illegal mining and pilferage of coal from the leasehold area of Eastern Coalfields Ltd (ECL) to certain so-called railway areas and railway sidings since the state of West Bengal, through its railway police force, was vested with powers of general policing of railways.Railways is a Union ministry.“Further, for any unlawful possession of railway property, the relevant investigating agency is the Railway Protection Force, under the Railway Property (Unlawful Possession) Act, 1966. Therefore, CBI through the impugned FIR is attempting to usurp the constitutional powers of the state police and the Railway Protection Force,” added the state’s plea, which will be argued by senior counsel Abhishek Manu Singhvi.The West Bengal government has disputed the correctness of an order of the division bench of the Calcutta high court, which, on February 12 permitted CBI to continue its investigation in the entire state despite revocation of the consent by the state government.This order was passed by the division bench on the appeal filed by CBI as well as one of the prime accused in the case, Anup Majee, who has also approached the apex court.The state has submitted in the apex court that the high court erred in holding that railway areas in a state are excluded from the purview of consent to be provided by states, and that withdrawal of consent by a state would have no impact on investigation in such areas.Meanwhile, an SC bench of justices DY Chandrachud and MR Shah took up Majee’s petition for a hearing on Monday but adjourned it to March 10 on a request made by CBI, represented by solicitor general Tushar Mehta.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tmc-govt-cbi-set-for-another-face-off-in-supreme-court-101614650182628.html
02-03-2021||India||Madras HC to monitor IPS officer’s sexual harassment case against top cop||The Madras high court on Monday took suo-motu cognizance of a woman Indian Police Service officer’s complaint of sexual harassment against special director general of police and said it will monitor the CB-CID investigation ordered by the state government on February 26.The CB-CID has registered an FIR against the accused under sections 354-A (sexual harassment), 341, 506(1) under the IPC and section 4 of the Tamil Nadu prohibition of harassment of women Act 1998, officials said.The agency will also investigate the role of superintendent of police (SP) of Chengalpet district, D Kannan, who allegedly stopped the woman police officer’s vehicle from entering Chennai when she was on her way to file the complaint with the Director General of Police (DGP) JK Tripathy and the home secretary.Justice N Anand Venkatesh of the Madras high court on Monday said he is taking suo motu cognisance and monitor the CB-CID probe.According to a senior police officer who spoke on condition of anonymity, the incident resulting in the complaint happened on February 21 when the complainant travelled in the accused’s car while on official duty for chief minister Edappadi Palanisami’s tour of the central districts.The accused in the case denied the charges and said he is being subject to a media trial.“I’m challenging the complaint; everything is hearsay,” he told HT.“People who are politically motivated and professionally jealous are doing it. Why are people jumping the gun and conducting a media trial? Why can’t they wait to get access to the official complaint when nobody knows what is in it? Why so much uproar for something that hasn’t happened. Why are they not allowing a committee which has been constituted based on Supreme Court directions to function without influence? On what basis are people jumping to a conclusion?...This (suo motu) is because of things in the media. If there is substance in the original, if this is a solid case, why would you indulge in a media trial?” he asked. The Tamil Nadu government on February 24 formed a six-member committee to inquiry the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/madras-hc-to-monitor-ips-officer-s-sexual-harassment-case-against-top-cop-101614650076100.html

Therefore, it will be done gradually," said a press release recently issued by the Bar Council of India.The Supreme Court registry has arranged a vaccination facility on the premises in addition to the ones at the government hospitals listed for the vaccination. The cost of vaccination will be as per the Central government’s guidelines. Private hospitals can charge up to ₹250 per shot.The judges will not be able to choose between Covaxin, developed by Bharat Biotech, and Covishield, developed by Pune's Serum Institute of India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-judges-to-get-vaccine-today-no-choice-between-covaxin-covishield-101614649293323.html

02-03-2021||India||17-year-old dalit girl was strangulated, smothered to death: Police||The body of a 17-year-old Dalit girl was found near a field at a village in Aligarh, police said on Monday, adding that the post mortem report suggested she was strangulated and smothered to death.“Strangulation and smothering have been assigned as reasons for death of the girl. The body was dragged from a nearby field to the spot where it was found by villagers,” said SSP Aligarh Muniraj G.When asked about possibility of rape, the SSP said no injury marks were found on the internal parts of the body.“Yet, we cannot be conclusive about rape as doctors have not confirmed it in post mortem report…,” said the SSP, who did not rule out attempt to rape as a possibility. He added that some people have been rounded for interrogation and five teams constituted to work out the case.Earlier, tension prevailed in the area when the police took the body for the post mortem. Heavy force was deployed at the post mortem house.Also, Rapid Action Force (RAF) and women police force were deployed during a protest march taken out by locals in Aligarh city against the killing.The girl had reportedly gone to gather fodder at about 12pm on Sunday but did not return. Her family began searching for her and was soon joined by other villagers. Later, the body was found in a field, police said.The incident comes in the backdrop of Unnao case, wherein two minor girls were found dead in a field last month when they had gone to collect fodder.Sources said villagers blocked police vehicles and resorted to stone-pelting when police tried to take the body for autopsy, injuring Pramendra Singh, the in-charge of Gangiri Kotwali of Aligarh district, in the head.Police have registered a case under sections 302, 376 of Indian Penal Code, and sections of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act on the family’s complaint, the Aligarh SSP’s office said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/17yearold-dalit-girl-was-strangulated-smothered-to-death-police-101614647941866.html
02-03-2021||India||Over 5 million sign up on Day 1 as vaccine drive enters Phase 2||Over 5 million people signed up and close to 150,000 people from the general public received coronavirus vaccines on Monday, the first day the drive was opened up beyond health care and frontline workers, leading to a rush of registrations and crowds of hopeful recipients at hospitals across the country.The Union health ministry said nearly 3 million registrations were done on the Co-WIN portal, with each having the provision to sign up four people. “Even if we assume one mobile phone registered at least two beneficiaries, it is more than 5 million recipients registered in a single day that we are talking about,” said RS Sharma, the chairman of the empowered group on Covid vaccinations.The drive kicked off by Prime Minister Narendra Modi taking his dose of the vaccine at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Delhi early in the morning, following which a bevy of prominent people too took shots in an attempt to encourage others.“I appeal to all those who are eligible to take the vaccine,” Modi said on Twitter, posting a picture of him getting the shot. “Together, let us make India Covid-19 free!”People above 60, and those who are 45 or more and suffering from certain medical conditions, are now eligible for the vaccinations. But some inoculation centres reported issues with the Co-WIN portal used to coordinate the drive, and people elsewhere reported being confused into trying to book appointments on a synonymous app that is available on application stores.Amid the teething troubles and the crowds seen at the hospitals, there were close to 430,000 doses administered on Monday – lower than the peak of roughly 800,000 seen late last month. But the numbers are set to pick up given the spate of registrations had proven the demand for the shots was high, officials said.“I think people are quite willing to take the vaccine and there is a huge demand at this point of time...We have a total of 12,500 private hospitals that have come on board since today and 15,000 hospitals in the public sectors. So 27,000 institutions in all and even at a conservative estimate of each one vaccinating 100, we will have 2.7 millions in a day,” said Sharma.India, which has reported the highest number of Covid-19 cases after the United States, has so far delivered 14 million doses, mostly to health and front-line workers since starting its immunisation programme in mid-January. It wants to cover 300 million of its 1.3 billion people by August.On average, India has been vaccinating about 500,000 beneficiaries daily across the country, a rate that experts say is inadequate at a time when cases have begun inching up across the country.Over the past three days, the country recorded over 16,000 cases on an average, compared to close to 12,000 in the middle of last month. At least four states are showing signs of a resurgence, making officials fear a second wave may be building.Among the prominent people who took a dose were Vice President M Venkaiah Naidu, Odisha chief minister Naveen Patnaik, Bihar CM Nitish Kumar, Rajasthan governor Kalraj Mishra and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar and his wife.“I felt no discomfort after getting the shot. I would now drive back to my village. The only regret is that my wife didn’t come with me as we have only one helmet,” said Ramkishore Sahu, an 80-year-old retired school teacher, who rode his motorcycle for around 68 kilometres to reach Ranchi’s Sadar Hospital to get the first dose of the vaccine.In Madhya Pradesh, 70-year-old Jagdish Pal was among the first to get vaccinated. “I reached the hospital at 8AM for vaccination but due to some technical error in the software. I had to wait for two hours. I am feeling good after vaccination,” said Pal, who recovered from Covid-19 three months ago.In some places, people complained about lack of clarity. “No information was provided on the procedure at the walk-in center nearby home. I have been asked to come back in a few days,” said Mumbai resident Abdul Khadas.In Chennai, Naidu and Tamil Nadu Governor Banwarilal Purohit took the first doses of the vaccine at the Government Omandurar Medical College Hospital. Dravidar Kazhagam president K Veeramani also took the shot at the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital here, officials said.(With inputs from regional bureaus and agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/over-5-million-sign-up-on-day-1-as-vaccine-drive-enters-phase-2-101614647410418.html

On Monday, it tweeted a video of the coach being tested at 180 kmph on the Kota - Sawai Madhopur section.Oscillation Trial :New AC 3-Tier coaches with modern facilities have been built.These coaches have been designed in an innovative way having capacity of 83 berths.Trial was conducted at 180 kmph in Kota - Sawai Madhopur section in loaded condition. pic.twitter.com/SVWGjLeJj7"New AC 3-Tier coaches with modern facilities have been built. These coaches have been designed in an innovative way, having a capacity of 83 berths.Trial was conducted at 180 kmph in Kota - Sawai Madhopur section in loaded condition," it tweeted.While an AC 3-tier coach has 72 berths, the new coach has 83 berths. According to reports, the Economy AC coach is likely to replace sleeper coaches in Express trains that run up to 130kmph. The non-AC sleeper coaches cannot attain the speed of 130kmph and hence there is a need for all AC coaches in Express trains, according to the railways. The luxuries of the Economy AC 3-tier coaches include personalised reading lights, AC vents, USB points, mobile charging points, improved ladder to climb to the upper berth and snack tables next to the aisle berths. In addition to all this and foot-operated taps for better hygiene, the coach also has a toilet and entry/exit points for those with special needs.  The fare for the tickets of this coach is expected to be higher than the sleeper class coaches, but lower than the regular AC 3-tier coaches, reports said. RCF Kapurthala has manufactured the luxury coaches.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indian-railways-completes-trials-of-new-economy-ac-3-tier-coach-at-180-kmph-101614647231128.html
02-03-2021||India||‘Are you willing to marry her?’ Supreme Court to rape accused||A Supreme Court bench headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde on Monday asked a rape accused whether he was ready to marry the complainant, attracting criticism from some lawyers.The comment came at a time when another bench of the Supreme Court is mulling sensitisation programmes and guidelines for judges of the subordinate courts to stop comments and stipulations that might trivialise sexual offences against women.“Are you willing to marry her?” the bench, led by the CJI, asked the accused who is a government employee at an electricity board in Maharashtra, and who approached the top court for bail in the rape case.“Will you marry her? If you are willing to marry, we will consider this (petition)…or else you will go to jail and lose your job,” added the bench, also comprising Justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian. It added that the court was not forcing the accused but was only asking about his willingness.But the lawyer, appearing for the accused, said he could not marry her since he was married. The counsel told the court that his client offered to marry the complainant, who was a minor in 2016, but she refused. “Then I married someone else,” said the accused, adding he was requesting for a protection from arrest since he would be suspended from the government job if jailed for 48 hours or more. The lawyer also pointed out that the alleged offence dated back to 2014-15 but the complainant lodged FIR in 2019 when she attained majority.According to the FIR, the complainant was stalked and raped by the accused several times in 2014-15 when she was a student of ninth standard. Later, mother of the accused assured that she would get her son married to her once she turned 18 but that promise was broken. The lawyer for the accused said his client was on bail since January 2020 but the Aurangabad bench of the Bombay high court cancelled his pre-arrest bail on February 5, this year on the woman’s complaint. The SC bench stayed the arrest of the accused for four weeks, allowing him to apply for regular bail before the trial court concerned.Supreme Court lawyer Aparna Bhatt said: “I am not aware of the full facts but it is shocking that in a case of rape, the Supreme Court considers marriage as a solution. These are serious crimes and no leniency should be afforded to the accused in such crimes... I hope the bar takes up the issue...”Bhatt, along with six other women petitioners, last year filed a petition in SC against a Madhya Pradesh high court order granting bail to the accused in a case of molestation on the condition that he would have the victim tie a rakhi (implying he would accept her as his sister). She also cited another case wherein an accused got bail to marry the victim.Bhatt’s petition came up before an SC bench headed by justice AM Khanwilkar in October and November 2020 when it was strongly supported by attorney general KK Venugopal. Pressing for training and sensitisation programmes for the judges of the subordinate courts, the A-G condemned the “patriarchal mindset” and added: “Any judge who wants to pass such an order must place themselves in the shoes of the victim of the sexual violence and assess the crime as if the same had been committed on a member of their own family.”Advocate Shobha, who has represented several victims of sexual offences said: “Such statements (about marrying victims) not only trivialise rape offences but shows how crimes against women in general, are seen by the society. It is very disturbing indeed when judges make such statements.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/are-you-willing-to-marry-her-supreme-court-to-rape-accused-101614646926673.html

Vijay Aggarwal, Choksi’s lawyer in India, said: “My client Mehul Choksi has clarified that he is very much an Antiguan citizen. His citizenship has not been revoked.”According to people aware of the developments, Choksi was issued a show-cause notice by Antigua and Barbuda authorities last year as part of the process to cancel his citizenship.Lionel Hurst, chief of staff to Antigua Prime Minister Gaston Browne, said the process to strip Choksi of his citizenship will take time. Hurst told news channel India Today that the government attempted to revoke Choksi’s citizenship but he filed a lawsuit in the High Court of Antigua and Barbuda. “This matter will take about seven years to be resolved. With enough money to pursue these legal challenges, 2027 is the earliest for a final resolution.” Choksi can move the Court of Appeals and the Privy Council in London if he loses in the HC.Comments from Hurst, Antigua’s immigration department and the Antiguan PM’s office were not available till the time of print.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mehul-choksi-challenged-move-to-revoke-citizenship-lawyer-101614646712606.html
02-03-2021||India||Looking back at the coronavirus war room||In July last year, while Delhi slowly emerged from the unprecedented trials of a lockdown and grappled with an average of 2,000 Covid-19 cases a day and a death toll nearing the 4,000-mark, HT spoke at length, over multiple phone calls, to two young doctors on the front lines of the fight against the disease about their experiences.Dr Richa Narang and Dr Saurav Kumar should have been done with their postgraduation -- Narang in anesthesiology and Kumar in general surgery — and in a job of their choice by April 2020; instead, with exams repeatedly being postponed, the lockdown and the pandemic spreading rapidly in the city, they found their teaching facility — the Lok Nayak Jai Prakash Narayan (LNJP) hospital being turned into the city’s first dedicated centre for Covid-19. All other work was now indefinitely on the back burner; as “junior residents” (which is what doctors in the final year of postgraduation are called) they were now the core ground force in the battle, working 14-day shifts interspersed with 14 days of quarantine.The two doctors witnessed it all: the transformation of the hospital into the largest Covid facility in Delhi, the initial days of “complete chaos and fear” when there weren’t enough “ventilators, oxygen masks or even cannulas”, learning to work in PPE suits in which they felt “suffocated” and would often be “terribly thirsty, desperate to go the washroom, drenched in sweat and finding it difficult to see through the fogged goggles — all at the same time”; and learning to deal with death.Narang, who grew up in a small apartment in Karnal in Haryana, said that she always wanted to be a doctor because she grew up idolising her sister, 12 years older to her, who is a doctor too. Narang is the youngest of four siblings born to a former school teacher and her husband, a lawyer.“I have a drive, I want to save lives, I want to keep trying,” Narang said in July, her voice choked with tears after a patient she cared for two weeks died in front of her. “I was very affected by the way patients died on my first shift: unable to breathe, no family members around, having spent all the time in hospital in isolation without loved ones.”Kumar grew up in a large joint family on a farm on the outskirts of Araria in Bihar; his father taught Botany in the government college in the city and Kumar is the older of two brothers, both doctors.“When I got into MBBS, I was not just becoming a doctor; for me, it was a generational leap,” Kumar said last year.“In 26 years, I’ve seen two completely different lives, one in the village where I grew up, and one here in the city. And now I am experiencing being on the front line in a pandemic.”How did life unfold for the two doctors since those conversations in July, as the pandemic hit a terrifying peak in the city in October and then slowly began to ebb?Richa Narang: Finally in August we finished all our MS exams. August 1, I gave my last practical exam, got my degree. It was a Saturday. On Monday, I went back to LNJP and joined the hospital as a Senior Resident. I had not met my parents since February, yet they insisted that I join immediately so I could be of service at this time of emergency. That was very inspiring. The one day’s break, on Sunday, I spent with my family. I was meeting them after six months but I spent the entire time in a mask and a face shield, keeping my distance. I ate my meals alone in my room.Saurav Kumar: Immediately after completing my MS, I left LNJP and started preparing for entrance exams for post-MS superspecialty courses. I cleared those exams too. In November, I joined RML (Ram Manohar Lohia) hospital. I joined because it was not a fully Covid hospital. Being a surgeon, Covid had a very negative impact on my training. For months at LNJP I did only Covid management, nothing to do with surgery at all. In November, when I put on my scrubs and entered the RML OT (operation theatre), it was the first time in about eight months that I was doing surgery. I cannot describe the feeling of happiness, it was almost an intoxication. I had to do a stomach closure on a 22-year-old. It felt to me like a second life!Narang: I was on the ground through the worst wave in Delhi. I felt very strong and proud of myself. I was constantly in the ICU, fighting to save patients. Yes, it was hard, it was sad to lose patients, but I kept going, wearing that PPE kit again for six hours a day in the ICU. A patient came in, 18 years old, so strong and positive, fighting Covid, but then she died of kidney failure. There was a 76-year-old patient who was suffering badly, but when I went to help, he held my hand and thanked me and blessed me and said that I’ll do a lot of good in my life. We were both crying. Thankfully, he survived. Another lady, around the same age, did not. Just before I intubated her, she said, even though she was struggling to speak, “god will bless you and look after you”. Then I put the tube in and later that day she passed away.Kumar: RML was the only Delhi government hospital at that time (November) where surgeries were being done. All emergencies were being sent here. We were running full, and of course when a patient came in to casualty we had to admit without knowing their Covid status. In an emergency, you can’t first do a Covid test and wait for the result, and then admit a patient -- you have to straight away start procedures. Outside of emergency, all patients coming in were being screened by the SARI (Severe Acute Respiratory Infections) team to be sent to Covid or general wards. I didn’t have to wear a PPE kit anymore, just double masks, but after being in a Covid hospital like LNJP, once I emerged from that, all fear of the disease had disappeared.Narang: The situation in October was what I imagine a battlefield will be like. We would lose a patient in the ICU, and immediately that bed will be filled with another patient coming in. One day when I was on duty there were five deaths. At one point we were losing 8-10 patients every day at the ICUs. A patient dies, is taken out, another patient is rushed in. It was relentless.For me the drill was the same. Fourteen days of work, 14 days of quarantine. On the seventh or eighth day of my quarantine, I would get a Covid test done, and if I was negative, I would go home for 2-3 days. I never tested positive. But then, in October, my father tested positive. He is 78, a heart patient. My mother is 80 and mostly bedridden. That was the worst time for me. I shifted my father out to an apartment we have in Noida; left my mother under the care of her domestic help. I took care of my father and worked my shift at the hospital. More than the physical stress, and the long drives, it was the emotional stress that was really hard. I slept badly at night thinking what if my father’s oxygen saturation drops at night and he is not able to call for help and I don’t wake up? Luckily, he got through it.Kumar: Once I was done at LNJP, I moved out of the hostel and into an apartment complex near Ferozeshah Kotla because it’s close to the MAMC (Maulana Azad Medical College) library, where I was studying. I was living alone, but that complex has a lot of young doctors like me, so I had a group of friends around which was important. Otherwise it can get so depressing and lonely. I could not risk going home to Bihar. Life was highly restricted. Just my apartment, the library, and back. This was how it was from August till November. No weddings, parties, birthdays, holidays... I still haven’t met my family. But they are all doing well. My brother has just finished his internship at the Armed Forces Military Hospital in Jammu.Narang: When the fall (in cases) started, it was a massive relief. From every ICU being full all the time, people dying and instantly getting replaced by another patient struggling for life, a time came when there were no mortalities. A time came when there were two patients in the ICU, and no calls for more patients coming in. That’s how the new year began for us.I think the one great thing that happened through this is that our infrastructure improved a lot. Every bed in every ward in LNJP now has oxygen supply. Earlier most wards would have 2-3 oxygen beds, and some had none. We got a lot of ventilators. In the anesthesia department, we had only one ICU to begin with. By October, we had four ICUs, each equipped with ventilators. We got lots of Bi-PaP masks (a small, pressurised breathing device) which worked wonders for Covid patients.Kumar: Covid has taught us some important things. We spent an extremely hard year learning these lessons, we should not let go of them easily. Hand hygiene for example, or standing in line, and maintaining distance. From personal experience in government hospitals I can tell you that there used to be constant chaos at the OPDs (out-patient departments) --people pushing and shoving -- now we see them standing in neat lines. They don’t have six feet distance between each other, but there is some distance. See, TB is also contagious, and it’s highly prevalent in India. We used to constantly tell people to not cough in our faces or in each other’s faces but they did not listen. Now they are covering their faces. I think because of Covid, the spread of some of these other infectious diseases are going down.Narang: In the first week of February, I got a Covishield jab. Then I celebrated my birthday in the Covid ward on night shift. In January, LNJP finally started admitting non-Covid patients too, people with serious illnesses like cancer who have been waiting for months for their surgeries. This week I’m on duty at the non-Covid OT.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/looking-back-at-the-coronavirus-war-room-101614644744871.html
02-03-2021||India||One year after Covid-19: A transformed political arena||To discern any change in politics — and remember changes in politics are, more often than not, incremental and take years to have a noticeable impact — the first clue is political vocabulary. The coinage of new terms reflects new ideas, and in turn, get reflected in political communication. Once the vocabulary gains legitimacy or appeal, there is an impact on political mobilisation — it is ideas that constitute the basis for any organised activity — as well as on policymaking — these ideas, when in power, get translated into action.This, then, generates debate and opposition, and ideas which till then enjoyed limited traction have become a part of everyday discourse.A year after Covid-19 hit India, it is instructive to examine — from the prism of politics — what has changed and what has not.Vocabulary offers a clue. On March 1, 2020, when news of the first case hit the national Capital, no one thought that terms such as mahaamaari (pandemic), do gaj doori (six feet distance, to describe social distancing), lockdown, migrant workers, unlock, corona warriors (to hail frontline workers), RT-PCR (the gold standard for Covid-19 testing), testing labs, Covishield and Covaxin (the two vaccines currently deployed in India), and atmanirbharta (self-reliance) would become a part of everyday discourse in India. No one thought that the idea of video conferencing between the Prime Minister and state chief ministers, or between the PM and world leaders, would become such a regular occurrence that it wouldn’t be even seen as a departure from the older physical format of meetings.No had thought that the impact of Covid-19 — reflected in this new discourse and new methods of interaction — would result in swasthya, or health, becoming a public policy priority of the highest order, with increases in budgets and allocations and renewed commitment to health-related institutions. No one thought that demand for better health care, more facilities for health workers and speedier vaccination, would come from below in the crowded political marketplace of demands. And no one thought that the link between health and economy — reflected in the long march of migrants back home — would become so starkly clear.Yet, all of this happened. And that reflects the story of political transformation in India 2020-21.But alongside, it is important to remember what has not changed.Politics remains driven as much by real or perceived identity-related grievances. There remains a powerful Centre, led by a dominant Bharatiya Janata Party, which has, for most part, so far, been able to politically overcome the disruption caused by the pandemic. There remains a weak national Opposition, which has neither been able to present an alternative model of how it would have dealt with the pandemic and associated challenges nor leverage the discontent the pandemic produced among citizens. There remains an even greater economic challenge of generating jobs at a time when inequality has only become more stark and more starkly visible. There remains both cooperation and discord in India’s federal structure, with differences between the Centre and states ruled by non-BJP forces. There remains the everyday staple of political rhetoric, as can be seen in states going for polls over the next eight weeks. And there remain questions about the health of India’s institutions and whether democracy can navigate the dominance of one party while ensuring checks on it.But along with this, the change is palpable.There may be differences on the quantum of public spending on health, but there is little doubt that no government can now afford to go to the people without a report card on what it has done to handle the pandemic and improve health systems. There may be differences on the quantum and nature of welfare spending, but political parties cannot discard the idea of State support to the vulnerable — at a time when instruments of welfare came to the rescue of India’s poorest citizens.There may be differences on the Centre’s new economic paradigm of embracing reforms and the private sector, but it clearly stems from a sense that the political economy cannot function in business-as-usual mode if India is to become “self-reliant” — and remember, the idea of self reliance itself is a product of the pandemic which disrupted global supply chains, brought home the reality of dependence on China, and the need to develop autonomously.And there may be differences on India’s foreign policy posture, but the pandemic has added to the urgency of making difficult geopolitical choices. The change is palpable in unlikely realms too, including the government’s relationship with big tech. Political communication — if you are on the side of the ruling dispensation or a part of the Opposition or a member of civil society organising protests — has become overwhelmingly dependent on digital communication. And while the dispute between sovereign States and online platforms was a long time coming, it is perhaps not a coincidence that this has intensified in recent months as the value of digital platforms has become even more pronounced.The pandemic has affected both social and economic structures. And if this is the case, politics and governance cannot be divorced from the underlying changes. It is still too soon — India is still confronting the pandemic — to accurately gauge the nature and scale of changes. It is also tempting to underplay the continuities and overplay the disruption. But what is clear is that the pandemic presented, arguably, one of the most difficult challenges the Indian State has confronted. When it emerges from it, scarred but also healed, the State — just like citizens — will not be the same. It will be better, in some ways, and it may be worse, in other ways.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/one-year-after-covid-19-a-transformed-political-arena-101614644039257.html
02-03-2021||India||Covid-19 changed the meaning of home, exposed social chasm||In a corner of the leafy Lake Gardens area in south Kolkata is an old one-storey house owned by the Boses. The matriarch of the family, Sutapa, is in her 70s and has lived by herself for almost 30 years. Her days are spent between the morning newspaper, the afternoon soaps, and the evening walk and adda with her neighbourhood friends, most of whom are senior citizens too.Last June, she welcomed new guests – her son and daughter-in-law who moved back from Mumbai after being laid off, as companies across the country shed jobs to survive after Covid-19 crushed the economy. Sutapa was initially glad for the company but soon realised the new occupants were more lax about the virus, and didn’t follow rules she had laid down for the house.During the nationwide lockdown, Bose changed the orientation of her living space. The passage between the door and the living room transformed into a sanitation area, the ACs were switched off and long-shut windows were pried open. She shifted into a smaller room but with a balcony and attached bathroom, put the television next to her bed, and removed her favourite four-seater sofa from the living room to discourage visitors. She paid her help, Malati, extra cash for putting a table and chair in the bedroom – for the occasional reading, letter writing, and bank pension work.“The first day of lockdown, I went downstairs for my evening walk and saw the street was deserted. Someone said, didi go back. I hadn’t realised how much I craved those two hours with my friends,” said Bose. She identified a long corridor inside the house for her walks, and continued her evening routine until Durga Puja in October, when she finally started stepping out more regularly.For a week after the lockdown, Malati helped Bose around the house, but soon, a stricter crackdown made any travel impossible. The rooms quickly lost their functional independence: the bedroom was the kitchen and the living room. When her son arrived in June, the second bedroom doubled up as a freelance workspace and the dining table was the new play area for their child.When the younger residents were careless with sanitising or called their friends over after the curbs were lifted in August, Bose refused to come out of her bedroom-kitchen-living room. “That room became my whole world and I was never gladder to own a house,” she said.Malati’s year was more difficult. A domestic help at five households, she lives in the rows of slums that line the nearby railway track. She braved the lockdown initially for work but soon found that she – and other helps from the slum – were being looked at with suspicion for being possible carriers of the virus. One building refused to let her enter and the families even abused her. In another, friends told her that the owner had Covid-19 symptoms but was refusing to get tested.With increasing crackdown, by the middle of April, Malati was no longer going to work. Instead, she and her husband were sharing their two-room shanty with their two children. With no income – her husband is disabled and unable to work – and her children’s local school closed, she not only found it tough to make ends meet, but also to observe any Covid-19 guidelines.“I came to know of many precautions one must take to stop the virus. But look at our condition, we struggled to get even rice and our water is not clean. How will we sanitise our hands?” she asked.In three months, she burnt through most of the money they had saved for their children’s high-school education. By June, she was back at work in the neighbourhood but salaries were depressed. Still, she supported the lockdown and was thankful that she didn’t contract the virus. “Every time I go for work, I see so many new furniture and contraptions to keep the infection at bay. I am struggling to even buy a second-hand phone to help my children follow school lessons at home,” she said.Covid-19 transformed not just our homes but their purpose. The television screens turned to home workout tutors in the morning, conference tables for Zoom meetings in the day, and movie screens for binge-watching at nights. Dining tables became work desks and balconies the new parks. Virtual Saturday night parties was the new going out.But this was also a time when the home lost its ability to make someone feel secure. The refuge suddenly became a space where one could bring in a life-threatening virus. As the world distanced itself, we clung to our homes and tried our best to make it more secure.A year into the pandemic, many of the curbs that kept us indoors during the summer are gone. But experts point out that the transition in home design and psyche may be permanent.“Homes can no more merely serve the basic purpose of containment or a place to sleep after work. They need to be empowered with the ability to speak to outdoors and cater to the multifunctional demands of the hour,” said Shraddha Kumar, a professor of urban planning at the Xavier University in Bhubaneswar.The transformation is already visible in the design of new homes – balconies, terraces and courtyards are more important, interiors are less rigid to accommodate more transformational spaces, entrance lobbies are designed as sterilisation spaces, and focus has increased on ensuring privacy of home residents.The neighbourhood is changing, too. Aware that any future surge in infections can render them islands, localities are trying to be self-sustaining, and balance a quality social life with maintaining a personal bubble in public spaces. “With the change in the way we live, work, socialise and communicate, our neighbourhoods also need to go through a transition to cater to social distancing without social disintegration,” Kumar added.But the disease and the lockdown also brought in sharper focus the growing gap between affluent neighbourhoods and the low-income shanties that often ring them — as mirrored in Malati’s struggles to ensure basic sanitation in her home.The outbreak exacerbated multiple other challenges faced by these marginalised communities: low income, inadequate infrastructure, lack of identity documents and state entitlements — that make complying with physical distancing and lockdown rules difficult.Experts suggest a raft of proposals, including community quarantine (not just central or home quarantine) options, support for livelihood loss, factoring in existing problems – lack of clean water, for example – into health policy and ensuring that community health workers, not police, is the first response of the administration.“The vulnerabilities that such neighbourhoods face have always been there, Covid didn’t create them. We’re talking about access to basic social infrastructure like water, sanitation and adequate housing that should mark a basic social safety net always… the key has to be to have universal access to core human development needs be a non-negotiable, regardless particularly of the tenure status of a settlement,” said Gautam Bhan, a professor at the Indian Institute of Human Settlements, Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-changed-the-meaning-of-home-exposed-social-chasm-101614643265126.html
02-03-2021||India||Elderly dispel fears, say vaccines are safe||HT Correspondentletters@hindustantimes.comNew DelhiEighty-year-old retired school teacher Ramkishore Sahu drove his motorcycle for around 68 kilometres to reach Ranchi’s Sadar Hospital on Monday to receive the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. “I felt no discomfort after getting the shot,” he said.The only regret, he said after getting the vaccine, was that his wife could not accompany him as the couple only own one helmet. “I would now purchase one [helmet] for her today itself and bring her tomorrow,” Sahu said.India on Monday expanded its vaccination drive against Covid-19 to include people above 60 of age and those over 45 with significant comorbidities.The vaccine is being administered free of cost at designated government hospitals and for 250 at private hospitals across the country. Bihar, West Bengal and Tamil Nadu, however, will administer the vaccine for free after the state governments in the respective states made promises to this effect.In Karnataka’s Bengaluru, 97-year-old Ramaswami Parthasarathy was the first to get the vaccine jab at Manipal hospital. “Mr Parthasarathy has been vaccinated and he is doing fine,” the hospital said in a statement.Several senior political leaders were also vaccinated on Monday.In Rajasthan, governor Kalraj Mishra, 80, received the first dose at the Raj Bhawan in the state and called upon all those eligible to take both doses of the vaccine.The first beneficiaries in the state were a family of senior citizens, including 72-year-old Mangala Dixit, a retired health director, who were vaccinated at the Sawai Man Singh Hospital. After the inoculation, Dixit said, “This vaccine is very safe. Everybody should get vaccinated.”Vice-president Venkaiah Naidu was vaccinated, along with Tamil Nadu governor Banwarilal Purohit, at the Governor Omandurar Medical College Hospital in Chennai.In Bihar, chief minister Nitish Kumar was administered the first dose of Serum Institute of India’s Covishield vaccine, along with deputy chief ministers Renu Devi and Tarkishore Prasad, and judges of the Patna high court, including chief justice Sanjay Karol.After receiving the first dose, Kumar said, “We had decided last year itself to provide the vaccine free of cost in the state. The state government will reimburse the cost of the vaccine at the 50-odd private health facilities, identified for vaccination.”Some states, however, also reported glitches with registration and walk-in vaccinations on the first day.In Madhya Pradesh, 70-year-old Jagdish Pal, who was among the first to get vaccinated, complained of technical errors in the software. “I reached the hospital at 8 AM for vaccination but due to some technical error in the software I had to wait for two hours. I am feeling good after vaccination,” Pal, who recovered from the Covid infection three months ago, said.MP chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan is scheduled to get the first dose of the vaccine on Tuesday, officials familiar with the matter said.In Maharashtra, Nationalist Congress Party chief Sharad Pawar, his wife, Pratibha Pawar, and daughter Supriya Sule, were given the first dose of the vaccine. Sule (51) represents Baramati Lok Sabha seat in Pune.Amid reports of glitches and some people saying they were finding it difficult to navigate the Co-WIN 2.0 app to register and book an appointment, the Union Health ministry clarified to say the app on Play Store is meant for use only by administrators. Registration and booking for appointments has to be done through the portal, it said.(With inputs from regional bureaus and agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/elderly-dispel-fears-say-vaccines-are-safe-101614642162914.html
02-03-2021||India||PM Modi gets first shot as second leg of inoculation drive begins||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday received the first dose of Covid-19 vaccine Covaxin, which has been indigenously developed by Bharat Biotech, as India’s immunisation drive against the infectious disease entered the second phase to cover about 270 million people.The Prime Minister, who was administered the dose at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), appealed to all those eligible in the latest phase of the vaccination to get inoculated. Modi reached the premier hospital on Monday morning and was administered Covaxin by nurse P Niveda, who hails from Puducherry. Another nurse, Rosamma Anil from Kerala, also assisted in the process.“Took my first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine at AIIMS. Remarkable how our doctors and scientists have worked in quick time to strengthen the global fight against COVID-19. I appeal to all those who were eligible to take a vaccine. Together, let us make India COVID-19 free!,” the PM tweeted.On Monday, the government opened up Covid-19 vaccination to those over the age of 60 and people aged 45 years or more with specified comorbidities.The PM opting for the indigenously developed vaccine was perceived as a move to support the Make in India campaign and to counter speculation about the efficacy and safety of the vaccine. Other than Covaxin, India has approved Oxford-AstraZeneca’s Covishield for emergency use.“The PM took Made-in-India Bharat Biotech’s COVAXIN and showed that both vaccines are safe and efficacious. We must come forward and take whichever vaccine is available. There’s been controversy comparing one vaccine to other that has been laid to rest,” AIIMS director Randeep Guleria told ANI.Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech tweeted it was “inspired and humbled” by PM Modi’s “remarkable commitment to build an Aatmanirbhar Bharat”.According to people aware of the developments, PM Modi opted for an early-morning slot at the busy hospital and to avoid inconvenience to the general public, no traffic restrictions were imposed. With a traditional Assamese stole draped over his shoulders, the PM chatted with the nurses while the vaccine was being administered. “Realising that the AIIMS staff could be nervous around him, he struck a conversation with them before he was given the shot and joked whether they were going to use a needle meant for veterinary purposes. When two nurses did not understand the question, he explained that politicians are known to be ‘very thick-skinned’,” a person aware of the developments said.The Congress’s Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury said: “In PM’s inoculation visuals, there was ‘gamcha’ (Assam), and nurses who vaccinated him were from Kerala and Puducherry. Coincidentally, there are elections in these states. It would’ve been five states had he also carried Rishi Aurobindo’s photo and Geetanjali.”AIMIM leader and Lok Sabha MP Asaduddin Owaisi said the government should clarify if Covishield was not good for those above 65 years of age. “Everybody in the country will have to take Coronavirus vaccine be it Covishield or Covaxin. I have one question, the German government said that Covishield, the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, which is being manufactured by the Serum Institute of India... the data published on the website of AstraZeneca says that it is good for people between 18 and 64 years. It is not effective on those above 64. PM Modi received a Covaxin shot. I want to request the government to clear the confusion,” he said.PM Modi taking Covaxin should remove all doubts people have about its side effects, Union health minister Harsh Vardhan said, underlining no death has occurred till now due to Covid-19 vaccination in the country. Vardhan said that if any death occurs a few days after receiving the jab, it cannot be linked to vaccination. Each such death is being scientifically probed, he said.As the vaccination drive got underway, Vice President M Venkaiah Naidu and several Union ministers including home minister Amit Shah, external affairs minister S Jaishankar, minister of state in the PMO Jitendra Singh and Bihar CM Nitish Kumar also received the vaccine. Nationalist Congress Party chief Sharad Pawar was also administered the shot.Several ministers who are eligible for the shot are in the process of finalising the schedule for their vaccinations. “BJP MPs, senior leaders and ministers who are eligible for the vaccine will be taking the shots at private hospitals where they will be charged for it. No one including the PM jumped the queue or got preferential treatment,” a person familiar with the matter said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-gets-first-shot-as-second-leg-of-inoculation-drive-begins-101614641978969.html
02-03-2021||India||Nearly half of all MPs eligible, likely to get jab before phase 2 of budget session||lmost one in two of India’s MPs are eligible to be vaccinated against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in the second phase of vaccination that got underway, and it is believed that most of them will at least get their first shot of the two-shot vaccine before Parliament resumes on March 8.Of the 777 MPs India currently has, 366 are above the age of 60, meeting the criteria of those who can be vaccinated in the current phase. Prime Minister Narendra Modi took his first shot of the vaccine — the indigenously developed Covaxin — at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, on Monday morning.People above the age of 45 years with significant so-called co-morbidities are also eligible to be vaccinated, although it isn’t known how many parliamentarians fall in this category.While the first shot by itself isn’t adequate, the availability of vaccines for MPs comes as a relief with Parliament that is preparing stage for the second phase of the budget session.The pandemic forced the government to skip the winter session 20 and the budget session saw significant precautions, including social distancing.According to parliament data, 36% Lok Sabha MPs are above 60 years of age. The Rajya Sabha, popularly called the House of the Elders, naturally has more eligible candidates with 62% of its MPs above that age.While official data shows that 218 out of 539 MPs in Lok Sabha and 148/238MPs in Rajya Sabha are eligible for vaccines in the 60-plus category, there is no data to show how many MPs in the age bracket of 45 to 60 years have comorbidities. “We do not keep any data on health conditions of MPs or ministers,” said an official in the Lok Sabha secretariat.An Opposition leader added that one of the key benefits of the vaccination would be that many MPs can campaign safely ahead of the upcoming assembly elections polls in four states and a union territory.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nearly-half-of-all-mps-eligible-likely-to-get-jab-before-next-budget-session-101614641282982.html
02-03-2021||India||'Will be able to scale up Covid vaccinations to 2.7 million a day’: RS Sharma||As the government opened up vaccination to people above 60 and people above 45 with comorbidities in Phase 2 of its Covid vaccination drive, Hindustan Times spoke to National Health Authority chairperson RS Sharma, the man behind registration system, about the process and the targets. Edited excerpts:The Prime Minister got his jab this morning. What kind of impact will it have?It’s a positive and powerful message to everybody, especially those who were doubting the vaccine and fearing side effects. The PM has been the spirit behind the entire citizen-centric approach we have taken from today.Can you clarify the registration process? Initially it was meant to be via Co-WIN app, but now we are told that it is only through the website.I’m glad to clarify this because I have also been sent screenshots saying this part is not working. There are as of now only two inlets, besides the walk-in registrations. One is the website (www.cowin.gov.in) where you can register up to four persons by providing your number. The other way is through the Aarogya Setu app, which has created an extension where you can also register.Was it decided later on to not have a different app for vaccinations?No, the confusion was not created by the government or any miscommunication — confusion gets created by WhatsApp messages etc. We’ve always maintained that there will only be two ways, besides being able to walk in and getting yourself registered and vaccinated immediately, provided there is vacancy. In future, in the next one or two months, people can create apps, get them certified, and register people.At what stage does one choose their slot?After you register, you can go back to the website or the Aarogya Setu app. When you log in, you can see your details, and you schedule the appointment. The two-step process is so that you can choose slots of your choice. You can also reschedule. Suppose you have a slot tomorrow, and something urgent comes up, you can just reschedule it on the website. The idea is that the vacancy created by your change can be taken by someone else. Earlier it was a captive audience of health care and frontline workers, and now it is a demand-driven situation. So, the possibility of no-show is much less.What has been the response?Well, about 1.5 million people have registered thus far (at 3pm on Monday -- the number was up to 2.9 million by late evening). If there are two people registered with one phone number, then we can assume there are three million registrations already. People are quite willing to take the vaccine. The software is capable of handling any numbers at this point of time. There may be some issues on the SMS gateway (for OTP generation) but otherwise our back-end infrastructure can handle it.How do you think the pace of vaccination will be impacted? Till now less than 1% have been vaccinated. At that speed, it will take a long time to complete.I’m not involved with the numbers, but more like a plumber, providing support to the drive. As an individual, however, I see a huge spurt in numbers, and we’ll be able to scale up very fast. It all depends on how private sector hospitals speed up, and also on supply etc. We have a total of 12,500 private hospitals that have come on board today, and about 15,000 hospitals in the public sector. So with 27,000 institutions in all, even at a conservative estimate of each one vaccinating 100, we’ll have 2.7 million in a day.Final question, how will the walk-in vaccination work?The walk-in facility is for slots which have not been filled up. For instance, suppose you have 100 vials for the public, of which you have a few of no-shows.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-be-able-to-scale-up-covid-vaccinations-to-2-7-million-a-day-101614639415350.html
