We will order the prisoners out on interim bail to surrender in 15 days.”On October 29 last year, the top court had stayed a direction passed on October 20 by the Delhi High Court directing 2,318 undertrial prisoners to surrender in a phased manner.This decision was challenged by NGO National Forum on Prison Reforms which pointed to the grim reality of overcrowded prisons and sought stay of the HC order in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. The petition pointed out that implementing the HC order will result in widespread confusion as prisoners will be forced to approach different trial courts. It also claimed that the surrender of close to 5000 prisoners will lead to overcrowding, heightening chances of a Covid-19 spread inside jail.From time-to-time, the top court kept extending its order of stay and lifted it only on Monday.The court kept the matter pending in order to monitor implementation of its order. The court also wished to know about the status on overcrowding of prisons across the country and sought a report on this aspect from Amicus curiae Gaurav Agarwal.The High Court had directed 2318 undertrials involved in heinous offences to surrender in a phased manner latest by November 13. Soon after the lockdown came into effect in March last year, the Delhi HC took suo motu notice of the pending interim bail pleas of prisoners before various trial courts and High Court and granted blanket extension till May 15. By subsequent orders in May, June, and July, the interim bails got extended. In addition to this, some 350 odd prisoners were also granted interim bail by the Delhi High Court as well.The HC in its October 20 order had said, “Now the situation has changed and all courts at High Courts and district level are functioning through physical or videoconferencing mode.”The HC also noted that inside the jails, there was no scare of Covid-19 outbreak as out of 16,000 prisoners only three were infected and were being kept under isolation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-ends-bail-of-over-2-000-prisoners-given-on-covid-19-ground-101614622652834.html
01-03-2021||India||Congress divided over alliance with cleric Siddiqui in Bengal||Serious differences appeared in the Congress on Monday over having an electoral alliance with Bengal cleric Abbasuddin Siddiqui’s Indian Secular Front (ISF) in the upcoming assembly election while the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) and its adversary, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), accused the Congress and the Left parties of playing communal politics by wooing the cleric as an ally.In a significant development, deputy leader of the Congress in the Rajya Sabha, Anand Sharma, accused the party’s Bengal president and Lok Sabha member Adhir Ranjan Chowdury of diluting the party’s core ideology and the secularism that Mahatma Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru endorsed.“Congress’ alliance with parties like ISF and other such forces militates against the core ideology of the party and Gandhian and Nehruvian secularism, which forms the soul of the party. These issues need to be approved by the CWC,” Sharma tweeted in the evening.“Congress cannot be selective in fighting communalists but must do so in all its manifestations, irrespective of religion and colour. The presence and endorsement West Bengal PCC President is painful and shameful, he must clarify,” Sharma said in the second tweet, indirectly referring to Chowdhury’s presence at the CPI(M)’s mega rally at Kolkata’s Brigade Parade Grounds on Sunday when Siddiqui delivered a speech.Meanwhile, the sixth round of seat-sharing talks between the Congress and the Communist Party of India (Marxist), or CPI(M), hit a wall in Kolkata with Chowdury declaring that his party cannot spare any seat for the ISF in Murshidabad and Malda, the districts having maximum Muslim population in Bengal and where the ISF wants to contest several seats."We are in charge of a state and don't take any decision on our own without any permission," ANI quoted Chowdhury as saying.“We wanted to contest 130 out of the state’s 294 seats and sat with the Left parties with a formula based on the 2016 poll results. We decided that the Congress and the Left parties would contest the seats they won and the ones where they came second in 2016. There was no other party in the picture when our talks started. They (ISF) came later and now the Congress has been allotted only 92 seats. How can we spare seats for others? Let the talks continue. We hope to reach a conclusion,” Chowdhury said at the party office.Despite the imbroglio in the seat-sharing talks, Biman Bose, Left Front chairman and senior leader of the CPI(M) which has already spared 30 seats for the ISF, held out hope of sorting things out.“We hope the seat-sharing will work out in the next few days,” he said.But another senior Marxist leader who did not wish to be named warned that the Congress’ rigidity could jeopardize the alliance.“If the Congress does not spare seats for the ISF the future of the third front may be jeopardized,” he said.“We still hope that the seat sharing will work out. Chowdhury has not officially communicated anything to us yet. We are not in this contest for our political gains. We represent all secular forces, the Dalits, the backward classes and the tribal people,” ISF president and Abbasuddin Siddiqui’s elder brother Nausad Siddiqui told HT on Monday night.In his speech on Sunday, Abbasuddin Siddiqui said he will not appease the Congress.“Our people will support Left Front candidates in every seat they contest. The Left Front has allowed us to contest around 30 seats. You might be thinking why I did not name the Congress. I want to make it clear that we will not appease anyone. We have come as partners. If anyone offers us the hand of friendship we will accept it,” Siddiqui said at the rally.Chowdhury’s strong reservations about Siddiqui became public at the rally.He stopped his speech when Siddiqui arrived on the dais in the middle of the event and people cheered to greet him. Chowdhury could be heard (over the public address system) telling Biman Bose and CPI(M) politburo member Md Salim that he would end his speech but they persuaded him to continue.“The ISF leader should have been more careful and patient,” Bose said on Monday.“Bose is the state’s most senior politician. We will follow his advice,” said Nausad Siddiqui.Both the Congress and CPI (M) also came under attack from the BJP and the TMC for their ties with the ISF.“The rally made it clear that Abbasuddin Siddiqui is dictating terms to the Congress. How can a party which calls itself secular be led by a religious leader,” said BJP’s Rajya Sabha member Swapan Dasgupta, taking a potshot at Chowdhury.“The CPI(M) and the Congress have both put into question their secular credentials,” said senior TMC leader and panchayat minister Subrata Mukherjee.But Bose rubbished the allegations that the Marxists have joined hands with a religious leader with an eye on the elections.“Abbasuddin Siddiqui may be a religious leader but ISF is a secular front. He will not field only Muslims. Members of the tribal community and backward classes will also contest for the ISF," Bose said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-divided-over-alliance-with-cleric-siddiqui-in-bengal-101614619587598.html

This will be the first of the many public meetings Adityanath is scheduled to address in Bengal where the BJP is looking to unseat the Mamata Banerjee-led TMC, which is hoping to win a third consecutive term in the state.“He could be raising the issue of migrant labourers in West Bengal and love jihad. He could also flag the issue of zero tolerance on corruption in UP besides highlighting the construction of Ram temple at Ayodhya,” said BJP’s UP unit general secretary Chandra Mohan.BJP leaders said that the UP chief minister, known for his aggressive style of campaigning, has been fielded as a star campaigner for his impact on the Hindu voters.A BJP leader who did not wish to be named said the party’s strategy was to respond to TMC and their leaders in the “most befitting manner”.“In view of the impact on the people of the Hindu community in West Bengal, the BJP leadership has fielded CM Adityanath with the announcement of elections. He will influence the campaign with his aggressive style of campaigning and the considerable influence he wields on voters. That is why he is among the most sought-after leaders,” he said.“In Malda from where Adityanath will begin campaign on Tuesday, he is likely to give a glimpse of the development model of UP. The CM’s public speech would focus on his model of dealing with mafia and criminals in UP, enriching the cultural heritage of the state and the economic growth in the state,” the party leader said.Adityanath has been drafted by the BJP in nearly all election campaigns outside the state.He was the only chief minister of the BJP, who campaigned in the municipal elections in Hyderabad. The effect of his campaign was also seen in the election results, party leaders said.“The BJP won 48 seats in a forceful performance and pushed Asaduddin Owaisi's party to number three. Earlier in the Bihar elections, Yogi Adityanath influenced the results on more than 75 seats in Bihar elections where he held 19 meetings in 17 districts. He highlighted the issue of terror, crime and corruption and helped NDA candidates triumph in 50 of these seats,” the state government’ media wing said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/adityanath-heads-for-malda-to-begin-poll-campaign-in-bengal-101614615242032.html
01-03-2021||India||'FASTags will save ₹20,000 crore per year on fuel': Gadkari||The usage of FASTags across national highways, mandated by the Centre, will help save ₹20,000 crore annually on fuel and boost the country’s revenue by nearly ₹10,000 crore, Union road transport minister Nitin Gadkari said on Monday.Gadkari was speaking at the launch of a live monitoring system for toll plazas across national highways to measure traffic queue length and waiting time on a real-time basis in a bid to provide immediate management response to reduce bottlenecks and improve efficiency of mandatory FASTag usage.The live monitoring system will measure the ‘Daily Congestion Index’ for each plaza as well as the overall congestion across the national highway network. It will also provide real-time details of high peak hours’ traffic at toll plazas."There is zero waiting time at 80 per cent of the total toll plazas. Toll collection through electronic tolling has reached 93 per cent from 80 per cent during the last fortnight after the FASTag was made mandatory," Gadkari said.Also read: ‘Against core ideology’ - Anand Sharma on Congress-Indian Secular Front allianceHighlighting the advantages of the live monitoring of toll plazas, the minister said that in a recent incident in Mumbai, where a vehicle was found parked outside an industrialist's house, the officials were able to detect the toll plaza through which the vehicle entered and who was sitting in it. Based on the information, the police is now investigating the case, he said. The Union minister was referring to the incident when a vehicle with explosive material was found parked near industrialist Mukesh Ambani's house in South Mumbai last month.“It is a simple help to improve traffic congestion problem at toll plazas/city roads/highways by using central monitoring system along with bundle of analytics and quick decision-making outputs. This is eventually likely to facilitate saving the commute time, improve customer experience, save fuel wastage cost and reduce carbon footprint. It uses several technologies like Satellite Imagery, GIS, Remote Sensing along with a proprietary algorithm to remotely monitor the congestion status on the roads. The frequency sample of data can be as low as even 1-5 minutes depending on the requirements,” the ministry said in a statement.Gadkari also launched a rating system for highways across the country. The ministry has also released the ratings for 18,668 kilometres of completed 4/6 lane National Highway stretches covering 343 toll plazas. Gadkari said 11,035 kilometres of national highways have been constructed during this year.“This has been done by the NHAI under MoRTH which has taken the initiative to improve its accountability towards road users who pay a user fee for the use of developed National Highways. This initiative has been taken as per the vision of improving the quality of public services. The fundamental objective of highway rating is “minimum time with maximum safety in stress-free environment” from highway users’ perspective,” the ministry said in a statement.Each toll plaza of a highway will be judged based on three major criteria - efficiency, safety and user services. These criteria are further divided into a total of 39 parameters which include average speed, road condition and facilities for public, service road, delay at the toll plaza, accidents, incident response time, wayside amenities and general cleanliness, among others.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fastags-will-save-rs-20-000-crore-per-year-on-fuel-gadkari-101614615354346.html

It doesn't matter that I had to wait for two hours as it was the first day. I felt no discomfort after getting the vaccine. I will now ride back to my village. The only regret is that my wife couldn't come with me as we have only one helmet. I will now buy one for her today itself and bring her tomorrow," Sahu said.He added, "I have no health issues, not even blood pressure or diabetes. But I was keen to get the vaccine as it will not only protect me from the infection but also protect others. None of my family members stopped me from taking the jab. People should come forward to get the vaccine as this is the only way out to check the spread of the pandemic."Vaccination for the second phase started late at almost every centre across the state on Day 1. Long queues could be seen at few centres as people were made to wait due to some technical reasons including verification of their identities."Vaccination was successfully carried out at all government and private centres on Day 1. People were very interested in taking the vaccine, which is a very positive sign. We are going to scale up the number of vaccination centres across the entire state. Some centres witnessed crowding as the process started late there. But things will be spruced up from tomorrow," state nodal officer (vaccination) Dr Ajit Prasad.Mismanagement could be seen at Ranchi's Sadar hospital where people were kept waiting for hours in the name of verification of identity.Three vaccination rooms and one observation room was set up for the purpose. While vaccination for the second dose of health care workers was carried out in one of the rooms, inoculation of front line workers and senior citizens for the first dose was done in two other rooms.People were seen violating the Covid-19 protocols like wearing masks and maintaining social distancing."I came here after completing online registration. But, here I was asked to go through the verification process first. When I approached for the same, I was told that people who came for the second dose would be dealt first and thereafter the verification process would start," said a senior citizen Anand Shankar Mohanty.Women residing at an old age home at Hesag in Ranchi's Hatia locality were also administered the vaccine on Monday. The district administration facilitated the transportation of these women for vaccination at Doranda's community health centre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/80yearold-rides-bike-70-km-to-get-first-shot-of-covid-vaccine-in-ranchi-101614612518054.html
01-03-2021||India||Finance ministry considers cutting taxes on petrol, diesel: Report||India's finance ministry is considering cutting excise duties on petrol and diesel to cushion the impact of record high domestic prices, three government officials close to the discussions said.A doubling in the price of crude oil over the past 10 months has contributed to record fuel prices at gas stations in India. But taxes and duties account for roughly 60% of the retail price of petrol and diesel in the country, the world's third biggest consumer of crude oil.As the coronavirus pandemic hit economic activity, Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government twice raised taxes on petrol and diesel in the last 12 months to boost sagging tax revenues instead of passing on the benefits of low oil prices last year to consumers.India's Finance Ministry has now started consultations with some states, oil companies and the oil ministry to find the most effective way to lower the tax burden on consumers without federal finances taking a big hit, the sources said."We are discussing ways in which prices can be kept stable. We will be able to take a view of the issue by mid-March," said one of the sources.The sources, who asked not to be named as the deliberations are private, said the government wants oil prices to stabilise before cutting taxes, as it does not want to be forced to change the tax structure again, should crude prices rise further.India's Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman recently said: "I can't say when we will reduce taxes on fuel, but (the) centre and states have to talk to reduce fuel taxes".India's Finance Ministry and oil ministry did not respond to an email requesting comment.The high fuel prices have prompted some Indian states to cut state-level taxes on petrol and diesel to rein in prices.Another one of the sources said a decision on fuel taxes may only be made following a meeting of OPEC and major oil producers, also known as OPEC+, later this week."There is an expectation that OPEC+ would agree to ease oil output curbs, we hope oil prices will stabilise after their decision," this source said.India has called on OPEC+ to ease production cuts as higher crude prices are hitting fuel demand in Asia's third largest economy and are contributing to inflation.The high fuel prices could also affect Modi's popularity ahead of state assembly polls in four states in March and April.Modi and India's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party are already facing their biggest political challenge in years with tens of thousands of farmers protesting against three farm laws passed by his government in 2020.The federal government and states together raised some 5.56 trillion rupees ($75.22 billion) in revenues from the petroleum sector in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, based on government data.In the nine months of this fiscal year (April-December 2020), contributions from the sector were about 4.21 trillion rupees, despite a significant decline in local fuel demand, the data showed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/finance-ministry-considers-cutting-taxes-on-petrol-diesel-report-101614611351065.html

And they believe that ongoing farmers’ movement could be an opportunity for them to connect with people in the region and other parts of the state,” a political expert said.The AAP has already announced it would contest the 2022 Uttar Pradesh assembly.Also read: Union ministers Amit Shah, S Jaishankar get Covid-19 vaccine after PM ModiIn his speech, Kejriwal emphasised that he tried to provide every possible assistance to agitating farmers at the Ghazipur and other borders of the national capital. The farmers are demanding a repeal of the Centre's three contentious farm reform laws.“It should not be an issue for the Union government even if it suffers a loss of ₹1-2 lakh crore by purchasing crops at the MSP (minimum support price) for the happiness of millions of farmers,” he said in the backdrop of the agitation.He also brought up the issue of sugarcane payment arrears. Sugarcane is a very important crop for the region’s rural economy and politics. He asked why the state government was unable to mount pressure for clearance of these dues.The crowd cheered him as he said, “Bring a government of good intentions and it would ensure that mills deposit money in the accounts of farmers before they return to their villages after dumping their load of sugarcane in the mills.”He spoke of how he “tamed” mighty power distribution companies in Delhi to ensure that people get free electricity and an uninterrupted power supply.The AAP chief again said, “If you bring a government with good intentions.... you would (get) free electricity and water in villages.”Kejriwal also criticised the government on the increasing fuel prices and cooking gas cylinders. A person even brought a cooking gas cylinder to the mahapanchayat as a symbolic protest against the increasing prices.AAP Rajya Sabha member Sanjay Singh, who played a key role in holding the mahapanchayat, has been attacking the Yogi Adityanath government over various issues in the last few months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kisan-panchayat-part-of-aap-s-plan-to-make-its-presence-felt-in-uttar-pradesh-101614611171985.html

01-03-2021||India||JD (U) rides piggyback on Brand Nitish on CM’s 70th birthday to revive party||After a poor performance in last year’s assembly election in Bihar, the ruling JD (U) on Monday embarked on a mission to leverage Brand Nitish on the chief minister’s 70th birthday to rebuild the party.The party organised programmes at every village across the state as Vikas Diwas to highlight the development work done under Nitish Kumar in the last 15 years.This is the first time that Kumar’s birthday has been celebrated in such a big way by the JD (U).The JD (U) had taken a serious hit in the 2020 assembly election, winning only 43 seats out of 115 it contested. After the shock and dismay, the JD (U) set itself a target to revitalize and rebuild the party from the grassroot level and affected several changes including change of national and state party presidents.“Our leader Nitish Kumar through his tireless work and service has restored the old glory of Bihar. Today people of state are living proudly in any part of the world,” said JD (U) national president R C P Singh, while justifying the celebration of Kumar’s birthday as Vikas Diwas.“He has shown the way by bringing in development with justice. Today, the Centre and several states are emulating schemes brought by him. The JD (U) workers will take his work, schemes of the government to each and every person and that is why we are celebrating his birthday as Vikas Diwas,” reasoned Singh.JD (U) national principal general secretary K C Tyagi described Brand Nitish as a phenomenon that ushered in clean and honest politics.“Post Lalu-Rabri regime, Brand Nitish has emerged as a new phenomenon in Bihar’s politics. Brand Nitish is a phenomenon which stood for good governance, politics sans nepotism and dynastic rule. It stood for development, clean and honest politics. These traits have made him one of the most successful chief ministers of the NDA,” said Tyagi.The party's principal general secretary said that he has served various ministries at Centre and burnished his reputation with his clean image. “We acknowledge that several forces (including LJP) tried to affect Brand Nitish and were able to affect us too. But the party is going to revive the brand which is opposed to sycophancy,” said Tyagi.A 70-pound cake was cut on the occasion at Athawan assembly constituency in Nalanda district, home to both R C P Singh and Nitish Kumar. Gifts, sweets and clothes were distributed among the poor by party leaders at several places.The party has left behind its recent setback in Arunachal Pradesh where six of its seven MLAs joined the ruling BJP and has set its sights on other northeastern states. It has identified 32 out of the 126 assembly seats in Assam where the party may field candidates in the three-phase election in the state between March 27 and April 6. The JD(U) is also contesting the West Bengal assembly election.“What has added to our belief of a better performance in Assam and West Bengal is that people have great respect for Nitish Kumar and they trust him. The development works done by Kumar, especially in Assam’s Nagaon district, during his tenure as Union railway minister when rail lines were laid for over 120 km, is still remembered by people. This rail line became the lifeline for many, and they profusely thank him for this,” said JD (U) national secretary and in-charge for the northeast, Sanjay Verma.The party think-tank believes that propagating the work and image of Nitish Kumar is the only way to revive the party’s popularity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jd-u-rides-piggyback-on-brand-nitish-on-cm-s-70th-birthday-to-revive-party-101614608077455.html

However, his blood pressure was showing a bit over the normal level, so he waited in the corridor, while his wife and parents, queued up for their turns to receive the Covishield vaccine."My dad retired as a senior officer from Air India and still has keenness to go for a brisk walk in the morning, which he has stopped now due to Covid," Rakesh Malhotra told PTI.He said his 1932-born father had migrated to India from the Pakistan side after the Partition."He survived that and we all have been safe from Covidso far. And, vaccination will further help now. Our PM today led from the front and got the shot himself. It will motivate others to get vaccinated," the son said.Among other family members who showed up in a group of four to get the jabs were the Sharmas and the Sahels, all four Covid survivors.Chader Mohan Sharma, 65, and wife Kavita Sharma, 64 came along with her brother Madhusudan Sahel and spouse Rita Sahel at the NHI vaccination centre.Sharma, who retired from a central government job, said, he and his wife had contracted the infection in November and other family members too were inflected."Even some of little children had Covid-19, and touchwood, we all survived it. We hope the vaccine shot will further boost our immunity," Kavita Sharma said.Delhi Health Minister Satyendar Jain on Monday said 308 centres have been set up at 192 facilities across the city for this phase of the vaccination.The vaccines being administered free of cost at government hospitals and health centres, while up to ₹250 per dose charged at private health facilities, including NHI.Another couple, Anil Chawla and Sunita Chawla, who came together to get the shots, went back smiling from the centre."My daughter and son-in-law both are doctors. She only did all the Co-WIN registrations for both of us," Anil Chawla said.Asked to compare the raging pandemic period last year and the vaccination drive going on at present, Sunita Chawla said, "It's like black and white, darkness and hope, and hope is very essential in life to survive".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/89yearold-couple-4-family-members-who-survived-covid-19-to-get-jabs-101614603285344.html

01-03-2021||India||Tejashwi Yadav meets Mamata Banerjee, offers full support in Bengal polls||Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader Tejashwi Yadav met Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee Monday afternoon and offered his full support to her in the coming assembly polls in Bengal.“Many people from Bihar and other states reside in Bengal. I appeal to all people from Bihar to unitedly support Mamata Ji. I will use my full strength to support her. This election is about protecting Bengal and its culture, which is unique. This is a fight to save Bengal’s values. Our leader Lalu Prasad Ji wants this,” Yadav said referring to his father, shortly after meeting Banerjee at Nabanna, the state secretariat.Former Bihar chief minister Lalu Prasad Yadav is currently serving jail sentence in the fodder scam case that the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) started probing in mid-1990.The RJD will contest a few seats as an ally of the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC). Yadav arrived in Bengal two days ago and held meetings with party workers.“At a time when the nation’s ministers should be working hard to save the country and the people they are all camping in Bengal. The BJP is spreading lies. It is selling the assets of the nation, such as the railways and the Steel Authority of India,” said Yadav.Banerjee was present when the young RJD leader was talking to reporters.“I congratulate Tejashwi. He is a young leader. The BJP used all kinds of tricks to stop him from winning the Bihar elections. But I know he will lead Bihar very soon. The way Laloo Prasad Ji is suffering in jail is unfair. The BJP should get the message. Wherever Tejashwi is fighting, I am fighting. And where I am fighting, he is fighting. You (BJP) cannot win this election no matter how hard you control the media and how big you talk,” said Banerjee.Yadav accused the BJP of not doing anything for the development of Bihar. “They did not even make Patna University a Central university. They promised to generate 20,00,000 jobs but nothing has happened. During the Covid-19 lockdown labourers from Bihar were treated badly. Nothing was done to send them home from other states. People died while walking on highways and were run down by trains. Their numbers were more than those who died of Covid-19,” said Yadav.“In sharp contrast, Mamata ji was on the streets, helping people. No matter how much we praise her, it won’t be enough,” said Yadav.The RJD is an ally of the Congress in Bihar and the two parties are trying to contest the Assam election together.Asked whether the RJD's support to the TMC against which the Congress is contesting in Bengal, would affect his party's political equations with the grand old party, Yadav said, "Our alliance with Congress is in Bihar. These alliances depend on political situations which vary from region to region."Bengal Congress leaders did not comment on Yadav's statements till Monday evening.The RJD and Maharashtra's Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leaders held talks with TMC leaders last month and agreed to form an alliance against the BJP in the Bengal assembly polls.Bihar’s ruling party, the Janata Dal (United), or JDU, the Samajwadi Party (SP) from Uttar Pradesh; Jharkhand’s ruling party, the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) and Maharashtra’s Shiv Sena have also decided to contest the polls either in alliance with the TMC or independently.The entry of the regional parties has triggered the possibility of a split in votes cast by Hindi-speaking and tribal people.A large number of people with roots in Bihar are permanent residents of Bengal. The state is also home to a large number of migrant workers from Bihar.BJP’s Bengal unit chief Dilip Ghosh brushed aside any threat to the party from the RJD’s alliance with the TMC."Many regional parties were seen supporting Mamata Banerjee before the Lok Sabha polls in 2019 but we have seen how they faced defeat. They will face the same fate again. Those who lack confidence need crutches. We are confident of winning more than 200 seats," Ghosh said.While the BJP has been claiming that it will win more than 200 of the 294 assembly seats in the state while election strategist Prashant Kishor, who was roped in by Banerjee in 2019 after the BJP won 18 of the state’s 42 Lok Sabha seats, has announced on social media that he will leave his profession if the saffron party bags more than 99 seats.BJP’s Barrackpore Lok Sabha member Arjun Singh, who formed the TMC’s Hindi cell before joining the saffron camp in 2019, recently told HT that no regional party can make any difference in the coming polls since it is a direct contest between the BJP and TMC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tejashwi-yadav-meets-mamata-banerjee-offers-full-support-in-bengal-polls-101614602762971.html

01-03-2021||India||Not afraid of coronavirus, won't take jabs: Farmer leaders in vulnerable age group||Protesting farmer leaders in the vulnerable age group Monday said they are not afraid of coronavirus and won't take vaccine jabs, even as the second phase of vaccination drive got underway to inoculate senior citizens and those above 45 with underlying medical conditions.However, they also said they will not stop any farmer camping at several Delhi borders from getting vaccinated as it is an individual choice.Thousands of farmers, mostly from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, have been camping at three Delhi border points -- Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur -- for over three months, demanding a repeal of the three agri reform laws enacted by the Centre in September last year.The 80-year-old armer leader Balbir Singh Rajewal, a senior member of the Samyukta Kisan Morcha which is spearheading the agitation, said he will not go to vaccination centres to receive the jabs."I don't need vaccine jabs. We have killed corona. Farmers’ immunity level is strong because they work hard on their fields. Farmers are not afraid of coronavirus,” Rajewal told PTI.Another senior leader Joginder Singh Ugrahan (75) said the fear of contracting the disease is "not enough" to distract them from their fight."There is no corona for farmers. I will not get vaccine shots, but we will not ask anyone to not get the shot," said the president of Bharatiya Kisan Union (Ekta Ugrahan), which is leading the protest at Delhi's Tikri border.However, Dharmendra Malik, the media in-charge of Bharatiya Kisan Union leader Rakesh Tikait who is leading the protest at the Ghazipur border, said if the local administration makes arrangements for protesting farmers, Tikait will not have any problem getting vaccinated.The 70-year-old Kulwant Singh Sandhu, a member of Samyukta Kisan Morcha, said he will not receive the vaccine shot."We are not afraid of coronavirus. Thousands of farmers are staging sit-in protests at Delhi borders, but not a single case of coronavirus has been detected there," Sandhu said.Earlier in the day, Prime Minister Narendra Modi took his first dose of Covid-19 vaccine at the AIIMS here and appealed to all those who are eligible to get inoculated.“Took my first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine at AIIMS. Remarkable how our doctors and scientists have worked in quick time to strengthen the global fight against Covid-19," he tweeted."I appeal to all those who are eligible to take the vaccine. Together, let us make India Covid-19 free!" Modi said.The second phase of the Covid-19 vaccination drive began on Monday in the country.In the first phase, starting January 16, over 3.6 lakh beneficiaries comprising healthcare workers and frontline workers, have been vaccinated in Delhi.On Monday, the drive began to give jabs to persons aged 60 and above, and those in 45-59 age bracket with comorbidities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/not-afraid-of-coronavirus-won-t-take-jabs-farmer-leaders-in-vulnerable-age-group-101614602073483.html
01-03-2021||India||PM taking Covid-19 vaccine a powerful message: NHA chief RS Sharma||As the government opened up vaccination to the general public today in phase 2 of its Covid vaccination drive, Hindustan Times’ Sunetra Choudhury spoke to the man who is responsible for the system of registration. National Health Authority (NHA) chairperson RS Sharma, who oversaw the Aadhaar drive, told HT that the government expects vaccination to scale up from the current 800,000 per day to at least 2.7 million daily in this phase. Edited excerpts: The Prime Minister got his jab this morning. What kind of an impact will it have?It’s the most positive message to everybody, especially those who were doubting the vaccine, feared that it will have side effects. The PM taking the jab is a very, very powerful message. He has been the spirit behind the entire citizen-centric approach we have taken from today. Can you clarify the registration process? Initially, it was meant to be via CoWIN app but now we are told that it is only through the website.Glad to clarify as I have also been sent screenshots saying this part is not working. There are, as of now, only two inlets, so to speak, besides the walk-in. One is the website (cowin.gov.in) where you can register up to four persons by providing your mobile number. Once you register, you can schedule appointments. The other way is through the Aarogya Setu app which has created an extension where you can also go and register. So was it decided later on to not have a different app?No, the confusion was not created by the government nor was there any miscommunication. Confusion gets created by WhatsApp messages, etc. We have always maintained that there will only be two sources besides being able to walk in and get yourself registered and get vaccinated immediately, provided there is vacancy. In future, in the next couple of months, people can create their own apps, get it certified and register people.Also Read | No issue in CoWIN portal, walk-in systems to be streamlined: Harsh VardhanAt what stage does one choose their slot?After you register, you can go back to the website or the Aarogya Setu app. When you log in, you can see your details and then you schedule the appointment. The two-step process (registering and then scheduling) is so that you can choose slots of your choice or at a time you want to. You can also reschedule as many times as you want. Suppose you have a slot tomorrow and something urgent comes up, you can just reschedule on the site. The idea is that the vacancy created by your change can be taken by someone else. Earlier, it was the health and frontline workers and now, it is a demand-driven situation. So, the possibility of no-show is much less.So how has been the response?Well, 1.5 million people have registered thus far (3pm). If there are two people registered with one phone number, then we can assume there are 3 million registrations. I think people are quite willing to take the vaccine and there is a huge demand at this point of time. The software is capable of handling any numbers at this point of time. We have scaled up our system. There may be some issues on the SMS gateway (for OTP generation) but otherwise, our infrastructure at the back-end can handle it.How do think the pace of vaccination will be impacted? Till now, less than 1% population has been vaccinated. Going by that speed, it will take years to complete the process.I am not involved with the numbers but more like a plumber, providing support to this drive. As an individual, however, I see a huge spurt in numbers and we’ll be able to scale up very fast. It also depends on private sector hospitals’ speed, also on the supply, etc. We have a total of 12,500 private hospitals that have come on board today and 15,000 hospitals in the public sector. So 27,500 institutions in all, and even at a conservative estimate of each one vaccinating 100 people, we will have over 2.7 million inoculations in a day. How many people were we vaccinating in the previous phase?We have clocked 800,000 vaccinations a day, which was the maximum. So we will clock better, but estimating numbers isn’t my area.What percentage of our healthcare and frontline workers would you say have been covered already?I think we have done fairly well. I don’t know exact numbers but, about 80%, maybe more. How will the walk-in option for vaccination work?Walk-in is for slots which have not been filled up. For instance, suppose there are 100 vials for the public, and there have been a few no-shows. If it’s 3pm or 4pm, then you could walk into a centre and get that shot. In rural areas, we will motivate people to walk in and get vaccinated. The system is flexible enough to allow online scheduling and also to provide documents and get instant vaccination.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pmtaking-covid-19-vaccine-a-powerful-message-nha-chief-rssharma-101614602002483.html
01-03-2021||India||Bombay HC sets aside quota in Goa municipal polls for constitutional breach||The Bombay High Court at Goa has quashed and set aside the notifications for reservations to five of the 11 municipal councils that are scheduled to go to polls later this month ruling that the reservations were arbitrary and without application of mind besides also violated the principles laid down in the constitution.In a judgment pronounced on Monday while disposing a bunch of petitions which challenged various aspects of the notification issued by the State Director of Municipal Administration, the court ruled that the government erred in failing to ensure a minimum of 33% seats are reserved for women besides also pointed out to irregularities in reservations for other categories including for Scheduled Tribes, Scheduled Castes and other backward classes.Instead the Court has directed that the Director of Municipal Administration issue a fresh notification within 10 days from Monday, thereby ensuring inter alia, reservation for women of not less than one-third of the total number of seats reserved for direct elections to the Municipal Councils.The elections which were scheduled for March 20 will have to be rescheduled for the five councils while the six others for which the order doesn't apply are expected to go ahead as scheduled. Municipal elections in Goa are not held on party lines.The primary grouse of those who approached the High Court was that the Director of Municipal Administration failed to reserve ‘no less than’ 33% seats for women pointing out that the number of seats reserved for women was less than 33% largely because the state ‘rounded-off’ the fraction to the lower limit rather than the upper limit, which the court ruled could not be applicable.“The expression used in the Constitution as well as in the Municipalities Act, being "not less than" or "no less than", make it clear that even a fraction cannot be ignored because by ignoring the same, the reservation would be minimized than 1/3rd and if it is done so, it would amount to infraction of the constitutional mandate,” the High Court bench of Justice M S Sonak and Bharati Dangre, ruled.“The fraction even if it is created in calculating 1/3rd reservation cannot be permitted to be rounded off towards the earlier denomination and the normal principle for rounding off, which is based on logic and common sense; "if part is one half or more, its value shall be increased to one and if less than one half the value shall be ignored", cannot be made applicable here,” the High Court ruled.“The Director after having admitted that there was no policy based on which the reservation has been made or rotation policy implemented, appears to have regarded the absence of such policy as a licence to make reservations based on his whims and caprices. Different yardsticks have been applied in respect of different Municipal Councils,” the High Court also said.Opposition parties which had accused the government of malicious intent in the reservation policy have claimed that the verdict was a slap on the face of the Pramod Sawant-led government.“With [the] High court striking down the Director of Municipal Administration Notification dated 4th February 2021 on Municipal Ward Reservations, It is [the] beginning of [the] End of @BJP4Goa Governments Jumla Raj with Manipulations in Electoral Polls. Let us all rise to Save Democracy,” Leader of Opposition Digambar Kamat tweeted.“Today all #Goans won the verdict of #truth. The BJP led government of @DrPramodPSawant has failed yet again to #cheat us #Goemkars. Today is a historic day. Today is a day of truth. Today marks another moment towards the end of @DrPramodPSawant oppressive reign. #SaveGoaNow,” Leader of the Goa Forward Party Vijai Sardesai tweeted soon after the verdict.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bombay-hc-sets-aside-quota-in-goa-municipal-polls-for-constitutional-breach-101614600368411.html
01-03-2021||India||BJP vs Trinamool, now over attack on 82-year-old woman in Bengal||A BJP worker in Bengal and his octogenarian mother were attacked by Trinamool supporters in Nimta area of North 24 Parganas district late on Saturday night, the party alleged in its latest attack on the ruling state party ahead of the elections that begin on March 27. The Trinamool, on its part, termed it "fake news".The BJP said the woman is the mother of Gopal Majumdar, a local party worker, who was attacked by TMC supporters. The woman, who lives with her son, was also assaulted, the BJP alleged and posted her photographs and videos on social media. In the video, the woman could be heard telling a news channel that TMC supporters barged into her house around 4:30 am and assaulted her and her son. She also said that she could not identify the assaulters. "They told me not to disclose who did this," the 82-year-old woman said.Agnimitra Paul, president of the women’s front of the Bengal BJP, visited Majumdar on Monday afternoon and demanded that the alleged assaulters be arrested.“Chief minister Mamata Banerjee claims to be the daughter of Bengal but there is no respect for a mother in her state,” said Paul.The TMC leadership alleged that the BJP was spreading fake news to gain political mileage before the assembly elections. “No TMC worker assaulted the woman. It is fake news,” said panchayat minister Subrata Mukherjee.Education minister Partha Chatterjee said in a tweet that the woman was a victim of family feud. He also tweeted a video in which a man who identified himself as the grandson of the woman denied that she was assaulted.“There is no truth in this. My grandmother is bedridden for three years. When I heard about the alleged assault I went to her house. I asked her how can the TMC be dragged into an internal feud of the BJP. Nobody assaulted my grandmother,” Gobinda Majumdar said.An official of the Nimta police station said on condition of anonymity that they would look into the allegation once a written complaint is made.West Bengal elections will be held in eight phases from March 27 to April 29, making it the longest ever polls in the state. The results will be declared on May 2.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-vs-trinamool-now-over-attack-on-82-year-old-woman-in-bengal-101614600452508.html
01-03-2021||India||Brace for very hot days and warm nights in NW India this summer||The entire Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP) region, including Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi and Uttar Pradesh, is likely to experience both hot days and warm nights during the March to May season, according to India Meteorological Department’s seasonal outlook for the pre-monsoon season on Monday.Above-normal seasonal maximum and minimum temperatures are likely over most subdivisions of north, northwest and northeast India, few subdivisions of the eastern and western parts of central India and few coastal subdivisions of northern peninsular India according to the outlook. Below-normal maximum temperatures are likely over some subdivisions of the southern peninsula and adjoining central India.Also Read | Delhi: February this year second warmest since 1901, says IMDOver the IGP region, there is a 60% to 70% probability that maximum temperatures are likely to be 0.56 to 0.71 degrees Celsius above normal while minimum temperatures are likely to be about 0.12 degrees Celsius above normal. There is a 70% to 100% probability that maximum temperatures in Odisha, Chhattisgarh and the Konkan region in the west coast will be 0.66 to 0.86 degrees Celsius above normal.The probability forecast for minimum temperatures indicates that above-normal minimum temperatures are likely over most of the subdivisions of north India along the foothills of Himalayas, northeast India, western part of central India and, and southern parts of peninsular India. Most of the subdivisions of east and adjoining central India, and few subdivisions of extreme northern part of the country are, however, likely to experience below-normal minimum temperatures.Interestingly, the outlook also states that currently, moderate La Niña conditions are prevailing over the equatorial Pacific, and sea surface temperatures (SSTs) are below normal over the central and eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean. The latest Monsoon Mission Coupled Forecasting System (MMCFS) forecast indicates that La Niña conditions are likely to sustain during the upcoming hot weather season from March to May.“Yes, La Niña has a cooling influence but La Niña is not the only factor that the model considers. There is climate change and other variations which can impact weather. So even if La Niña conditions are moderate, it doesn’t necessarily mean a less warm summer. Frequency of heat waves is likely to be higher in northwest India, Odisha, Jharkhand, Gujarat, Konkan, etc. We also have to remember that this model only gives us an average for the season. There can be large day-to-day variations which will be highlighted in IMD’s daily forecasts,” explained DS Pai, senior climate scientist at IMD, Pune.El Niño and the Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is a periodic fluctuation in sea surface temperature and the air pressure of the overlying atmosphere across the equatorial Pacific Ocean according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).ENSO has a major influence on weather and climate patterns such as heavy rains, floods and drought. El Niño has a warming influence on global temperatures, whilst La Niña has the opposite effect. In India for example, El Niño is associated with drought or weak monsoon while La Niña is associated with strong monsoon and above-average rains and colder winters.IMD is preparing new policies for better preparedness during summer. It will issue heat wave warnings valid up to five days daily which will be updated by the national weather forecasting centre. Impact-based heat wave warning will also be issued wherein the general public is advised how to protect themselves. For example, if a severe heat wave is likely to persist for more than two days or total number of heat wave days are likely to persist for over six days then extreme care will be suggested for vulnerable people. There will be a high likelihood of developing heat illness and heat stroke among all age groups during such conditions. IMD will also provide meteorological support to states and districts for preparation of heat action plans. A GIS-based web page has been created for heat wave warnings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/brace-for-very-hot-days-and-warm-nights-in-nw-india-this-summer-101614599302123.html

01-03-2021||India||‘Disastrous’, say green activists as J-K govt gives free pass to stone crushers||The Jammu and Kashmir government's recent decision to do away with licenses to start operation of stone crushers and hot and wet mixing plants has sparked outrage among environmentalist who have warned that the step could have disastrous consequences for the union territoryLast week, the government notified the J&K Stone Crushers/ Hot and Wet Mixing Plants Regulation Rules, 2021 which dispensed with the requirement of a license to start operation of stone crushers/ hot and wet mixing plants in Jammu and Kashmir to promote ‘ease of doing business’ by creating a business-friendly environment."The decision will facilitate establishment and functioning of stone crushers, hot and wet mixing plants and boost the supply of raw material required in the construction sector. This will also expedite completion of various mega-projects in Jammu and Kashmir," said the government notification.Environmentalists have flagged the decision and described it as dangerous for Jammu and Kashmir."This will certainly affect the environment. The question is who will determine the site of a crusher plant, where will the materials come from and who will determine its output? The more the crushers the more the chances of pollution increase even if all the requirements are complied with. Besides, there will be more possibilities of illegal mining," said Gowhar Ahmad, an environmentalist.He said that Kashmir is already facing a dust problem and the crushers will aggravate the problem.Raja Muzaffar Bhat, an RTI and environment activist said that instead of promoting industrial units with less carbon emissions, the government has given free hand to pollution causing industries. "This will lead to a disaster and also cause pollution and destroy our streams and rivers."Jalal Jeelani, an environment film maker also said the decision will lead to more pollution. "We have already lost many wetlands, streams and hills due to human interference. This will open more doors for pollution and nobody will be able to stop it."According to the government notification, the new rules recognize a stone crusher/hot and wet mixing plant as a mineral-based (raw material) processing unit different from those involved in mineral mining activity."As such, the applicability of provisions regulating the working of industrial units has been extended to cover these units, thus, doing away with the need of obtaining respective licenses from the Mining Department. However, if a stone crusher/hot and wet mixing plant undertakes mining of minerals as an additional line of activity, it shall then be additionally governed by the rules applicable to mining industrial units," the notification said.It also said the new rules make it obligatory on the mineral processing units to procure minor minerals from a valid mining concessionaire registered with the Mining Department. The Department has been authorized to inspect such units, ascertain the source of the raw material and undertake seizure of the illegally sourced minerals."The decision provides major relief to the entrepreneurs by removing the burden of double registrations wherein the unit holders had to go through the rigorous procedures of registrations and licensing with the Industries and Commerce Department as well as the Mining Department," the notification said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/disastrous-say-green-activists-as-j-k-govt-gives-free-pass-to-stone-crushers-101614595184270.html

Accordingly, action has been taken to address these threats.""NCIIPC informed through mail on Feb 12 about threat by Red Echo through malware Shadow Pad that 'Chinese state-sponsored threat Actor group known as Red Echo is targeting Indian Power sector's Regional Load Dispatch Centres along with State Load Dispatch Centres'," the ministry added.It also said that the government took prompt action by blocking all IP addresses and domains listed in NCIIPC mail.

There is no impact on any of the functionalities carried out by POSOCO due to the referred threat.

At least 18 people were killed and 30 more injured when Myanmar police fired on protesters across the country on Sunday, the UN human rights office said, citing credible information it had received. It said the use of lethal force against non-violent demonstrators is “never justifiable” under international human rights norms. “Embassy of India is deeply saddened by loss of lives in Yangon and other cities of Myanmar [on Sunday]. We express our heartfelt condolences to families and loved ones of those deceased,” the Indian embassy in Yangon said on Twitter. “We would urge all to exercise restraint and resolve issues through dialogue in a peaceful manner,” it added. Also Read | Myanmar court files 2 more charges against Suu Kyi; protesters march againThe deaths on Sunday marked the bloodiest day in weeks of protests against the February 1 military coup. The deaths occurred as a result of live ammunition fired into crowds in Yangon, Dawei, Mandalay, Myeik, Bago and Pokokku, UN human rights office spokesperson Ravina Shamdasani said. Since the beginning of the coup, police and security forces have targeted an “ever-increasing number of opposition voices and demonstrators by arresting political officials, activists, civil society members, journalists and medical professionals”, Shamdasani said. On Sunday, police detained at least 85 medical professionals and students and seven journalists who were at demonstrations. More than 1,000 people were arbitrarily arrested and detained without due process in February, and some of them remain unaccounted for, Shamdasani added. India has adopted a cautious position on the developments in Myanmar because of its good relations with both the civilian leadership and the military, as well as its security concerns linked to the northeastern states. India’s security forces have worked with their Myanmar counterparts in recent years to pressure militant groups from the northeast that have bases in the neighbouring country. Soon after the coup, India had expressed deep concern and emphasised its support for the process of democratic transition in Myanmar. It also called for the rule of law and the democratic process to be upheld.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/concerned-by-loss-of-lives-in-myanmar-india-calls-for-restraint-101614595101738.html

But the same case is still being investigated by the CBI, the state government said in its reply.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/wb-coal-mining-scam-sc-seeks-centre-s-response-on-plea-challenging-hc-order-101614594824850.html
01-03-2021||India||Elgar Parishad case: SC may hear Gautam Navlakha’s bail plea this Wednesday||The Supreme Court is likely to hear on Wednesday a petition filed by civil rights activist Gautam Navlakha seeking default bail in the Elgar Parishad case where he is named as an accused for inciting violence in Bhima-Koregaon in January 2018.Navlakha, in his petition filed through advocate Shadan Farasat, has sought bail on the ground that the National Investigation Agency (NIA), which is probing the case against him, has failed to file the charge sheet within the stipulated period of 90 days. This period has been prescribed under Section 167(2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC).The activist, who is facing serious charges under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act for his alleged links with banned Maoist organisation – Communist Party of India (Maoist) – had earlier approached the Bombay high court, stating that the period of 90 days got over and the NIA, which took over the probe in January last year, had failed to file the final report of investigation before the trial court.In the high court, Navlakha had said that the period of detention under house arrest should be calculated as part of the custody period faced by him for the purposes of Section 167(2) CrPC. The HC on February 8 refused to accept this plea. It stated in its order that the order of keeping him under house arrest was already declared “illegal” by the Delhi high court and hence, this unlawful detention cannot be added under the period of arrest. Navlakha has challenged this finding in the top court.Also Read | Elgar Parishad case: Bombay HC grants six months’ interim bail to Varavara RaoAccording to the Supreme Court website, the case is listed for hearing before a three-judge bench comprising Justices UU Lalit, Indira Banerjee and KM Joseph on Wednesday.Navlakha was first arrested in connected with this case in August 2018 when the case was probed by the Maharashtra Police. After NIA took over the probe, he had to surrender in April 2020. According to Navlakha, he was in house arrest for a period of 34 days beginning August 28, 2018. On October 10, 2018, the Delhi high court set aside the order of the magistrate placing him under house arrest as illegal. During the period of house arrest, he was not allowed to meet anybody and even the NIA did not have access to him.The HC, while noting these facts, said, “It is not possible for us to fathom a situation where detention of the appellant (Navlakha) though held to be illegal and unlawful rendering the authorisation by the magistrate untenable should still be construed as an authorised detention for the purpose of Section 167(2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure.” Further, the HC observed that the period of house arrest from August 28-October 10, 2018 cannot be treated as detention for purposes of investigation that resulted in deprivation of his personal liberty.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/elgar-parishad-case-sc-may-hear-gautam-navlakha-s-bail-plea-this-wednesday-101614594143605.html

We (judges) are sitting at a distance," Justice Shinde said.He referred to the incident of 60 advocates testing positive for Covid-19 at Amravati district in Maharashtra."Fortunately, we have not had any untoward incident here. We are going in the right direction and we don't want to go back to hearing cases virtually," Justice Shinde said. He asked everyone, including lawyers, to wear masks at all times.Justice Gautam Patel of HC had last month issued a notice complaining of overcrowding in court and had directed everyone to strictly adhere to safety norms.Last week, Justice Prithviraj Chavan had refused to hear a case as the lawyer appearing in the matter had removed his mask.Amid the outbreak and lockdown, the HC had suspended physical hearings in April last year and began conducting hearings for urgent matters through video conferencing system.It subsequently began a combination of virtual and physical hearings, and in December last year, resumed physical hearing for almost all cases.Currently, all courts in HC function at full capacity, hearing cases physically from Monday to Thursday.On Fridays, some courts conduct virtual hearings for cases where the lawyers or parties are not based in Mumbai, or, if there is a specific request for such hearings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bombay-hc-judge-warns-against-overcrowding-in-court-101614591703710.html

We must come forward and take whichever vaccine is available. There's been controversy comparing one vaccine to other, that has also been laid to rest today," Guleria told news agency ANI."PM took Covid-19 vaccine and showed that we must do the same when turn comes. It will go long way in getting over vaccine hesitancy. All over 60 years of age and those above 45 years with comorbidities must take vaccine. It's the only way to come out of pandemic," he added.Guleria added that PM Modi wanted to put the nursing officers at ease and therefore he joked, talked to them in local language and enquired where they were from. "It really helped because nurses were not aware of whom they would be vaccinating," he said."This (PM receiving Covid vaccine jab) will be a big game-changer. I am sure a large number of people will come and take the vaccine. We have opened many sites to accommodate people, both in govt and private sector. In AIIMS, five sites have been opened," Guleria added.PM Modi received the indigenously developed Covaxin jab by Bharat Biotech this morning and appealed to all those who are eligible to get inoculated."Took my first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine at AIIMS.

01-03-2021||India||‘Not a shot fired’: Ceasefire brings peace to India-Pak border, big test ahead||A renewed pledge last week by India and Pakistan to adhere to a ceasefire pact along the Line of Control (LoC) and international border in Jammu and Kashmir is working on the ground, people aware of the matter said but underscored that the truce would face its biggest test over the next few months when the snow, which clogs infiltration routes, starts melting.“The ceasefire is a win-win for India and Pakistan and for the border population in the two countries,” said a top police officer in Jammu and Kashmir after the first review of the ceasefire starting May 24 midnight indicated that it had led to a huge change on the ground. “Not a single shot has been fired along the border since the ceasefire came into force,” the officer said.The two armies announced the ceasefire after a discussion between India’s Director General of Military Operations (DGMO), Lt Gen Paramjit Singh Sangha, and his Pakistani counterpart, Maj Gen Nauman Zakaria on February 22. Diplomatic and military back channels had been preparing the ground for the discussion for monthsAlso Read: The difficult path to Indo-Pak peaceIn a statement released three days later, the defence ministry said the two sides agreed to address each other’s core issues and concerns that could disturb the peace to achieve “mutually beneficial and sustainable peace along the borders”. The promise to adhere to the ceasefire agreement of November 2003 came into effect from January 24 midnight.The peace along the border comes after firing and shelling by border guards on both sides for several years. The incidents had peaked in 2020 when, according to data tabled in Parliament last month, Indian security forces reported 5,133 ceasefire violations; an average of 14 every day or one violation every two hours.According to data compiled by the Border Security Force alone, there have been 302 instances of cross-border firing after 1 August 2020 till 25 February when the ceasefire pact kicked in. Of these, 67 cross-border firing incidents were reported in the first two months of this year. Nearly 95% of these 302 firing incidents reported from the border are under the BSF’s Indreshwar Nagar sector headquarter.The BSF guards the international border with Pakistan and is also deployed at some locations along the Line of Control under the army’s command.Indian security forces responded to these violations and lately started the use of extended range Excalibur shells that can target important towns across the border to retaliate the Pakistani army targeting villages on this side of the fence. In the last three years alone, 341 civilians had died in the border firing that included small arms and artillery shelling.Haji Mohd Shafi, village head of Pukharni, a border village in Jammu’s Rajouri district, thanked prime ministers of the two countries for the ceasefire. “We can now sleep and work in peace,” he told news agency ANI.Indian security officials, however, conceded that the ceasefire would face its biggest test over the next few months when the snow on the high mountain passes starts melting. This is when attempts to infiltrate terrorists into Jammu and Kashmir start to increase.In the past, Pakistani Rangers often opened fire on the Indian side to give the terrorists cover fire. Or to distract Indian border guards away from locations and routes being used by the terrorists to infiltrate into Jammu and Kashmir.If this happens again, it would bring the stated intentions of Prime Minister Imran Khan and Pakistan’s army into question, an official said.To be sure, PM Khan has attempted to put the onus to create an “enabling environment for further progress” in bilateral ties on India. “I welcome restoration of the ceasefire along the LOC. The onus of creating an enabling environment for further progress rests with India,” Khan tweeted on Saturday, his first reaction to the ceasefire by the two armies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/guns-go-silent-along-india-pakistan-border-after-ceasefire-big-test-next-101614589848098.html
01-03-2021||India||Chandrababu Naidu detained at Tirupati, stages sit-in at airport floor||Former Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu on Monday staged a sit-in inside the arrival lounge of the Tirupati international airport at Renigunta after he was detained by the police and told that he cannot enter the temple town due to enforcement of model code of conduct for the ongoing municipal elections in the state.The leader was to join his Telugu Desam Party leaders in protest against the YSR Congress Party. The TDP has alleged that the YSR Congress, with the help of police, is forcing the opposition candidates to withdraw their nominations in the municipal elections scheduled to be held on March 10.“Political parties are taking out rallies on account of elections and thousands of pilgrims are visiting Tirumala temple. Why are you imposing restrictions only on us?” TDP chief Naidu asked policemen.Several TDP leaders from Chittoor district, including former minister N Amarnath Reddy, former MLA M Sugunamma, MLC BN Dorababu and district TDP president Pulivarthi Nani were kept under house arrest.The TDP leaders held dharnas at the Mahatma Gandhi statues in Chittoor and Tirupati towns in protest against the alleged atrocities by the YSR Congress Party leaders in the municipal elections.The police, however, have refused to give permission to stage any dharnas citing the coronavirus pandemic and also because of the enforcement of the model code of conduct that prohibits any agitation by any political party.Naidu landed in Tirupati airport at around 10.30 am to take part in the dharna programmes of the TDP. Senior police officials who were already present at the airport detained him.The police authorities refused to concede the request of Naidu to allow him to at least submit a memorandum to the district collector and superintendent of police. They seized the mobile phones of Naidu and his associates.When the police served him with a notice stating that he would have to be arrested if he violated the prohibitory orders, an angry Naidu squatted on the floor at the airport lounge in protest. With folded hands, the police officials pleaded with him not to create disturbance at the airport, but the leader was unmoved.They said the collector and the SP would come to the airport to receive his representations. As an opposition leader, he had every right to meet the officials, the leader asserted.According to latest reports, the authorities are making efforts to send the TDP chief back to Amaravati.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chandrababu-naidu-detained-at-tirupati-stages-sit-in-at-airport-floor-101614588764443.html

The government has expanded the vaccinations campaign and under which citizens aged above 60 years and those above 45 years with comorbidities will be given the shot against the coronavirus disease. PM Modi reached New Delhi’s All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) early in the morning where he was given the indigenously developed Covaxin by Sister P Niveda. He told Niveda that the jab was administered so quickly that he didn’t even feel it. “Laga bhi di, pata hi nahi chala (Is it done already? Didn’t even feel it)”, he said to the nurse from Puducherry. Modi also urged eligible citizens to show up at vaccination centres to get the shot and contribute to making India Covid-19 free. “I appeal to all those who are eligible to take the vaccine. Together, let us make India COVID-19 free!" he wrote on Twitter.Here’s a look at the photos of PM Modi taking the vaccine doing the rounds on social media:||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-narendra-modi-takes-homegrown-covaxin-shot-interacts-with-health-staff-in-photos-101614580032954.html
01-03-2021||India||Covid-19: A year later, how politics changed and did not change||To discern any change in politics — and remember changes in politics are, more often than not, incremental and take years to have a noticeable impact — the first clue is political vocabulary. The coinage of new terms reflect new ideas, and in turn, get reflected in political communication. Once the vocabulary gains legitimacy or appeal, there is an impact on both political mobilisation — it is ideas that constitute the basis for any organised activity — as well as policymaking — these ideas, when in power, get translated into action. This, then, generates debate and opposition, and ideas which had, till then, enjoyed limited traction, become a part of everyday discourse. A year after Covid-19 hit the national capital, it is instructive to examine — from the prism of politics — what has changed and what has not. Vocabulary offers a clue. On March 1, 2020, when the first case hit the national capital, no one had thought that terms such as mahaamaari (pandemic), do gaj doori (six feet distance, to describe social distancing), lockdown, migrant workers, unlock, corona warriors (to hail frontline workers), RT-PCR (the gold standard for Covid-19 testing), testing labs, Covishied and Covaxin (the two vaccines currently deployed in India), and aatmanirbharta (self-reliance) would become a part of everyday discourse in India. No one had thought that the idea of video conferencing between the prime minister and state chief ministers or between the prime minister and world leaders would become such a regular occurrence that it wouldn’t be even seen as a departure from the older physical format of meetings. Also Read | Covid-19 cases in India may rise as summer will force people indoors: ExpertNo one had thought that the impact of Covid-19 — reflected in this new discourse and new methods of interaction — would result in swasthya, health, becoming a public policy priority of the highest order, with increases in budgets and allocations and renewed commitment to health-related institutions. No one had thought that demand for better health care, more facilities for health workers and speedier vaccination would come from below in the crowded political marketplace of demands. And no one had thought that the link between health and economy — reflected in the long march of migrants back home — would become so starkly clear. Yet, all of this has happened. And that reflects the story of political transformation in India 2020-21. But alongside, it is important to remember what has not changed. Politics remains driven as much by real or perceived identity-related grievances. There remains a powerful Centre, led by a dominant Bharatiya Janata Party, which has, for most part, so far, been able to politically overcome the disruption caused by the pandemic. There remains a weak national Opposition, which has neither been able to present an alternative model of how they would have dealt with the pandemic and associated challenges or leverage the discontent the pandemic produced among citizens. There remains an even greater economic challenge of generating jobs at a time when inequality has only become more stark and more starkly visible. There remains both cooperation and discord in India’s federal structure, with differences between the Centre and states ruled by non-BJP forces. There remains the everyday staple of political rhetoric, as can be seen in states going for polls over the next eight weeks. And there remain questions about the health of India’s institutions and whether democracy can navigate the dominance of one party while ensuring checks on it. But along with this, the change is palpable. There may be differences on the quantum of public spending on health, but there is little doubt that no government can now afford to go to the people without a report card on what it has done to handle the pandemic and improve health systems. There may be differences on the quantum and nature of welfare spending, but political parties cannot discard the idea of State support to the vulnerable — at a time when instruments of welfare came to the rescue of India’s poorest citizens. Also Read | India begins next phase to vaccinate its elderly and ill against Covid-19There may be differences on the Centre’s new economic paradigm of embracing reforms and the private sector, but it clearly stems from a sense that the political economy cannot function in business-as-usual mode if India is to become “self-reliant” — and remember, the idea of self reliance itself is a product of the pandemic which disrupted global supply chains, brought home the reality of dependence on China, and the need to develop autonomously. And there may be differences on India’s foreign policy posture, but the pandemic has added to the urgency of making difficult geopolitical choices. The change is palpable in unlikely realms too, including the government’s relationship with big tech. Political communication — if you are on the side of the ruling dispensation or a part of the Opposition or a member of civil society organising protests — has become overwhelmingly dependent on digital communication. And while the dispute between sovereign States and online platforms was a long time coming, it is perhaps not a coincidence that this has intensified in recent months as the value of digital platforms has become even more pronounced. The pandemic has affected both social and economic structures. And if this is the case, politics and governance cannot be divorced from the underlying changes. It is still too soon — India is still confronting the pandemic — to accurately gauge the nature and scale of changes. It is also tempting to underplay the continuities and overplay the disruption . But what is clear is that the pandemic presented, arguably, one of the most difficult challenges the Indian State has confronted. When it emerges from it, scarred but also healed, the State — just like citizens — will not be the same. It will be better, in some ways, and it may be worse, in other ways.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19a-year-later-how-politics-changed-and-did-not-change-101614582021499.html

Nadda’s statement came after the inauguration of BJP’s offices in the Kashi and Prayag Raj regions, on Sunday, taking the party's district offices in the state to 53, out of these, 51 were built in the year 2019.“Prime Minister Narendra Modi led government did a lot of work in the interest of farmers and launched several schemes for them, while the farmer leaders did only lip service. They did nothing for the farmers; while PM Modi gave honor to the farmers and worked to bring them into mainstream,” Nadda said before naming PM Kisan Samman Nidhi, PM Kisan Bima Yojana soil health card etc among initiatives taken for the farmers’ welfare.“When BJP leader and parliamentarian from Kashi, Narendra Modi, became the Prime Minister in 2014, he expressed a desire that you people have to expand the party. Our party organisation used to run from two rooms. Now, the party has expanded and the BJP formed the government on its own by winning maximum seats. Therefore, the party should have its offices in every district of the country and there should be arrangements for party workers to function,” said Nadda, explaining the party’s expansion drive.Nadda said the party's target was to build 700 party offices in the country, out of which, 400 have been built. He said out of the 80 BJP offices to be built in UP, 53 BJP have been built and the remaining 27 will be built by 2021. These offices, Nadda said, will be a medium for the party workers to inculcate quality values.Nadda said that the party office was equipped with all digital facilities, including e-library, conference hall, and video conferencing hall, however, it was only a hardware, which needed the software of party workers to gather new information and impart new vision and direction to the society, while working for the party’s development.Also Read: Kashi BJP gets hi-tech office, Nadda calls it 'medium' for best quality valuesHe claimed that since the BJP was working to carry the country forward, therefore, those with the opportunity to work in the BJP were lucky.“In India, all the national parties became regional parties.

Retail fuel prices had marked a record high on February 27 when the rate of per litre petrol went up by 24 paise and that of diesel increased by 15 paise for every litre in Delhi.The prices of petrol and diesel in New Delhi on Monday stood at ₹91.17 per litre and ₹81.47 per litre respectively. In Mumbai, the price of petrol stood at ₹97.57 per litre and the price of diesel stood at ₹88.60 per litre. In other metro cities like Chennai fuel prices retailed at ₹93.11 for petrol, and at ₹86.45 for diesel. In poll-bound Kolkata, where the ruling government cut value-added tax (VAT) on fuels by Re 1 on February 20, petrol prices remained steady at ₹91.35 per litre and diesel stood at ₹84.35 per litre.The price of petrol and diesel has been witnessing a rise this month as oil companies keep increasing prices. Union minister for petroleum, natural gas and steel Dharmendra Pradhan said on Sunday that he has asked his counterparts in major oil-producing nations to ramp up production so Indians can be relieved of exorbitant fuel prices. Pradhan also said that fuel prices will witness a drop once winter ends.“Increase in petroleum price in the international market has affected consumers too. Prices will come down a little as winter goes away. It's an international matter, price is high due to increase in demand, it happens in winter.

01-03-2021||India||Chinese hacker groups target at least dozen Indian organisations||Was a power outage that shut down Mumbai’s stock exchange and train services last October linked to the reported intrusion by Chinese state-sponsored groups into the computer networks of Indian power utilities and load dispatch centres? That’s the question being asked in cyber security circles after Recorded Future, a US-based security consultancy reported that Chinese groups had intruded into the networks of at least a dozen Indian state-run organisations since mid-2020 in an attempt to insert malware that could cause widespread disruptions. Among the organisations targeted were NTPC Limited, the country’s largest power conglomerate, five key regional load dispatch centres that help in the management of the national power grid by balancing electricity supply and demand, and the ports at Mumbai and Tuticorin, says the new study by Recorded Future, which tracks the use of the internet by state actors for cyber-campaigns. All 12 organisations would qualify as critical infrastructure, according to the Indian National Critical Information Infrastructure Protection Centre’s (NCIIPC) definition. The activity apparently began much before clashes between Indian and Chinese troops in May 2020, which triggered the border standoff in Ladakh sector of the Line of Actual Control (LAC), and there was a “steep rise” from the middle of last year in the use of a particular malware linked to Chinese state-sponsored groups to target “a large swathe of India’s power sector”, Recorded Future said. The report further said the alleged intrusions by the Chinese groups, some with known links to the Ministry of State Security (MSS), or China’s main intelligence and security agency, and the People’s Liberation Army (PLA), were not limited to the power sector. There were apparent efforts to target numerous government and defence organisations, the report said. “In the lead-up to the May 2020 skirmishes, we observed a noticeable increase in the provisioning of PlugX malware C2 infrastructure, much of which was subsequently used in intrusion activity targeting Indian organizations. The PlugX activity included the targeting of multiple Indian government, public sector, and defense organizations from at least May 2020,” the report said. PlugX has been “heavily used by China-nexus groups for many years”, and throughout the rest of 2020, Recorded Future’s investigators “identified a heavy focus on the targeting of Indian government and private sector organizations by multiple Chinese state-sponsored threat activity groups”. Although Recorded Future was unable to conclusively state whether the insertion of malware by the Chinese groups led to any disruptions, the report pointed to a massive power outage in Mumbai on October 12, 2020, that was allegedly caused by malware inserted at a state load dispatch centre in Padgha. Maharashtra power minister Nitin Raut had said at the time that authorities suspected sabotage was the cause of the outage. The two-hour outage resulted in the closure of the stock exchange, while trains were cancelled and offices across Mumbai, Thane and Mavi Mumbai were shut down. “At this time, the alleged link between the outage and the discovery of the unspecified malware variant remains unsubstantiated. However, this disclosure provides additional evidence suggesting the coordinated targeting of Indian Load dispatch Centres,” Recorded Future said in its report. A senior official of the Maharashtra energy department said the state’s cyber police unit would take appropriate action and suggest preventive measures. An investigation launched after the power outage in October was still underway. Dinesh Waghmare, principal secretary of the state energy department, said, “We had asked Maharashtra cyber police to investigate the matter as there was suspicion of sabotage. However, the investigation is still on and they have not come to a conclusion as yet.” “Preventive measures will also be taken,” Waghmare said. He was also in-charge of Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Ltd (MSEDCL) when the outage occurred on October 12. A day after the grid failure brought many parts of the city to a complete halt, state energy minister Nitin Raut had also said the possibility of sabotage couldn’t be ruled out. Also Read | China rolls out first locally made single-dose Covid vaccineRaut was expected to speak on the issue during the first day of the Maharashtra assembly’s budget session. Recorded Future identified the Chinese group involved in the intrusion activity as Red Echo and said it had strong overlaps – in terms of both the technology it uses and its victims – with other groups such as APT41/Barium and Tonto Team that have been involved in similar cyber-campaigns. The 12 organisations targeted by Red Echo included Power System Operation Corporation Limited, NTPC Limited, NTPC’s Kudgi power plant, Western Regional Load Dispatch Centre, Southern Regional Load Dispatch Centre, North Eastern Regional Load Dispatch Centre, Eastern Regional Load Dispatch Centre, Telangana State Load Dispatch Centre, Delhi State Load Dispatch Centre, the DTL Tikri Kalan (Mundka) sub-station of Delhi Transco Ltd, VO Chidambaranar Port and Mumbai Port Trust. All these groups use ShadowPad, a modular backdoor tool that has been utilised by China-backed groups in network intrusion campaigns since 2017. “We assess that the sharing of ShadowPad is prevalent across groups affiliated with both Chinese Ministry of State Security (MSS) and groups affiliated with the People’s Liberation Army (PLA), and is likely linked to the presence of a centralized ShadowPad developer or quartermaster responsible for maintaining and updating the tool,” the report said. Stuart Solomon, Recorded Future’s chief operating officer, told The New York Times that Red Echo “has been seen to systematically utilise advanced cyberintrusion techniques to quietly gain a foothold in nearly a dozen critical nodes across the Indian power generation and transmission infrastructure”. While the activities of many Chinese-sponsored groups of hackers in the West have been linked to cyber and economic espionage, Recorded Future concluded Red Echo’s actions in India were aimed at potential access to networks and insertion of malware to “support Chinese strategic objectives”. “Pre-positioning on energy assets may support several potential outcomes, including geostrategic signalling during heightened bilateral tensions, supporting influence operations, or as a precursor to kinetic escalation,” the report said. Recorded Future reported its findings to India’s Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-In), which acknowledged receipt of the information but didn’t say whether it had found the malware in the targeted organisations, The New York Times reported. There was no official word from central authorities in New Delhi on the reported intrusions by the Chinese groups.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chinese-hacker-groups-target-at-least-dozen-indian-organisations-101614572360610.html

Some beneficiaries were informed via hospitals and some old age homes had also been told about the vaccination, said Yogesh Raghuvanshi, spokesperson, office of the chief medical officer, Lucknow. Self-registration will also start from Monday. “This is a soft launch of Covid vaccination for the elderly, hence centres will be increased from March 4,” said Lucknow vaccination in-charge Dr MK Singh. Apart from the government hospitals, approximately 1,544 private hospitals in the state will also facilitate inoculation from March 4, with some of them beginning today itself. The approximate population of 50-plus people in the state is 35 million of which, approximately 17.5 million are those above 60 years of age. Self-registration of people above 60 years and those in 45-60 years of age with comorbidities is also expected to open today and this round of vaccination will run via on-the-spot registration, on a first-come-first-serve basis. On CoWin app, the beneficiary needs to enter name, age and other details and upload an identity document. If the beneficiary is 45-plus but below 60 years of age, they have to submit a doctor’s certificate as comorbidity proof. They can also choose a vaccination centre. In the state capital, Covid vaccination will be done in 137 private hospitals on payment basis, while government hospitals will continue to provide free of cost inoculation. “With 137 private and 33 government hospitals identified for vaccination, the total number of vaccination centres in Lucknow will be 170,” said Dr MK Singh, in charge, vaccination in Lucknow. When one self-registers on CoWin app, they will see the list of hospitals in their district empanelled under the central scheme. In Lucknow, currently there are vaccination centres at three government hospitals and a private one. These are: King George’s Medical University (KGMU), Dr Ram Manohar Lohia Institute of Medical Sciences and Civil Hospital. Shekhar Hospital is the private hospital with a vaccination centre. Meanwhile, KGMU has four vaccination booths, RMLIMS three, and Civil Hospital one. “At private hospitals, the beneficiary will pay Rs250 for each dose; ₹150 is for the vaccine which the hospital will pay to the government prior to getting vaccine dose, and ₹100 is hospital charge for vaccination,” said Dr Singh. Experts said vaccination among the elderly requires caution. “The elderly are vulnerable, hence their vaccination needs additional care, particularly during the observation time post the jab to observe and help them in case of any adverse reaction,” said Dr Abhishek Shukla, secretary general, Association of International Doctors. Doctors said a change could also be made in the vaccination process. “The observation time of 30 minutes can be extended for the elderly,” said Dr Kauser Usman, HoD, geriatric medicine at KGMU. Dr Usman said, “An extended observation time can be optional for those who want to stay longer after vaccination so that when they leave only when they are confident.” An online meeting for private hospitals was conducted by the Union health ministry on Sunday with private hospitals which have been identified as vaccination centres. “After the first dose, the second dose for the elderly will be administered after a gap of 29 to 42 days,” said Dr Abhishek Shukla, one of the participants.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/up-launches-covid-vaccine-drive-for-elderly-22-5k-to-get-jab-today-101614569900862.html

We are at an advanced stage of preparation and this will come into effect as the new session begins in 2021."Prime Minister Narendra Modi is passionate about preserving and perpetuating Indian values, heritage and cultural ethos and is putting in immense effort so that the children and youth of our country are made aware of our rich culture and tradition," the minister said."We can also introduce those values via modern technology and put it to optimum use," he said.He said many games played on mobile and other gadgets are "violent, explicit, addictive and tend to create a complex in the mind of children"."PUBG was just one example of it, but criticising those games is not the solution. The solution is to create our own games and apps in line with #MakeInIndia for the world so that these are adopted world over for their basic values that are an integral part of our Indian ethos," Javadekar said.He said this effort by Modi government will fructify and lead the nation into creating new games that promote Indian cultural ethos.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/many-mobile-games-violent-addictive-pubg-just-one-example-prakash-javadekar-101614567220455.html

01-03-2021||India||PM Modi urges use of Indian goods||Invoking his government’s Atmanirbhar Bharat initiative, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday said self-reliance is not just a government policy but a national spirit. “When every countryman takes pride, every countryman connects; self-reliant India doesn’t remain just an economic campaign but becomes a national spirit,” said Modi as he mentioned a series of Made in India achievements — from fighter plane Tejas to vaccines — in his monthly radio address Mann ki Baat.Making a pitch for rainwater harvesting, Modi announced the “Catch The Rain” campaign as part of which he urged the citizens to conserve rainwater for 100 days during monsoons.With most areas of the country expected to start receiving rain in May-June, the PM asked the people to start preparations for rainwater harvesting. “We shall have to understand our collective responsibilities with regard to water. Can we right away start a 100-day campaign for the sake of cleaning up water sources around us and conserving rainwater? With this very thought in mind, in a few days from now, Jal Shakti Abhiyan ‘Catch The Rain’ is being initiated by the Jal Shakti Ministry,” Modi said.Continuing with his Atmanirbhar Bharat pitch, Modi spoke about applying science in day-to-day life, raised the mantra of ‘Lab to Land’ and mentioned several examples of how people are applying scientific principles to create better products. “When every citizen of the country will spread the spirit of science in his life and in every field avenues of progress will open up, the country will become self-reliant too.”But with water remaining the dominant theme of his Mann Ki Baat, Modi read out letters on water storage techniques, shared how locals have found ways to rejuvenate water bodies and signalled what needs to be done in this regard. “We shall get existing rain water harvesting systems repaired, clean up lakes and ponds in villages, remove impediments in the way of water flowing into water sources; thus we shall be able to conserve rainwater to the maximum,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-urges-use-of-indian-goods-101614564116010.html

01-03-2021||India||India, US reaffirm strategic partnership at bilateral meeting of UN envoys||India and the US reaffirmed their strategic partnership and efforts to strengthen multilateralism, during a meeting between the UN envoys of the two democracies on Sunday, as Washington praised New Delhi for supplying critical Covid-19 vaccines across the world.US Ambassador to the UN, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, held a series of bilateral meetings with her UN Security Council counterparts.India's Permanent Representative to the UN, Ambassador T S Tirumurti, on Twitter, wrote that during the meeting with Thomas-Greenfield the two sides reaffirmed their strategic partnership."Pleasure to meet new @USAmbUN Permanent Representative @LindaT_G and discuss priorities of US Presidency of @UN #SecurityCouncil," Tirumurti tweeted.“We reaffirmed our strategic partnership. India's vaccine contribution was welcomed. We'll work together to strengthen multilateralism,” he tweeted.Beginning its two-year tenure as a non-permanent member of the powerful 15-nation council in January, India had said it comes into the Security Council as the largest democracy in the world, representing one-sixth of humanity and "with a strong commitment to reformed multilateralism, rule of law, fair and equitable international system, peace, security and development."Thomas-Greenfield, who formally presented her credentials to UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres last week, asserted that "multilateralism is back, and diplomacy is back, and America is back, and we're ready to get to work."Ahead of the US assuming the Security Council presidency on March 1 for the month, Thomas-Greenfield held meetings with all 14 of the Permanent Representatives to the UN on the Security Council."In meetings with the Permanent Representatives to the United Nations from Estonia, India, Kenya, Mexico, Niger, Tunisia, and Vietnam, Ambassador Thomas-Greenfield discussed the upcoming US presidency of the UN Security Council and conveyed the Biden administration's commitment to renewed engagement with the international community," United States Mission Spokesperson Olivia Dalton said in a statement.In her discussions, Thomas-Greenfield raised issues of mutual interest and concern, including US policy on regional issues, opportunities for future cooperation at the UN, shared priorities in the UN Security Council, and the humanitarian crisis in the Tigray region of Ethiopia, Dalton said in the statement.India's efforts and contribution towards providing critical supplies of the Covid-19 vaccines around the world are being widely applauded, with UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres hailing India for being a “global leader in pandemic response efforts”. India has provided coronavirus vaccines, critical medicines, diagnostic kits, ventilators and personal protective equipment to more than 150 countries.India has also announced a gift of 200,000 Covid-19 vaccine doses for UN Peacekeepers, ensuring that it will be possible to administer the required double doses of Covid-19 vaccines to the 94,484-UN Peacekeepers across the 12 missions.Under the initiative 'Vaccine Maitri' -- translates to 'Vaccine Friendship' -- India is providing immunisation doses to the world.External affairs minister S Jaishankar had told the Security Council last week that India is a significant contributor to the international vaccine alliance, COVAX, and that it was also directly sending vaccines to friends and partners."Starting with our immediate neighbours, 25 nations across the world have already received 'Made in India' vaccines. Forty-nine more countries will be supplied in the coming days, ranging from Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean to Africa, South-East Asia and the Pacific Islands,” Jaishankar had said.Guterres had said that efforts by India in developing and manufacturing one of the two vaccines currently granted 'Emergency Use Listing' by the World Health Organisation brought “much-needed supply to the global vaccine market”.Two versions of the AstraZeneca/Oxford Covid-19 vaccine were given the WHO's 'Emergency Use Listing'.The versions of the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine, produced by AstraZeneca-SK Bioscience (AZ-SKBio) and the Serum Institute of India (AZ-SII), are now available for global rollout through the COVAX Facility.Addressing reporters at the Security Council stakeout, after presenting her credentials to Guterres, Thomas-Greenfield had said that the United Nations is the world's "most important forum" for bringing people and countries together.She said the administration of President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris knows that "when America is at the table and acting in accordance with our values, the United States is an indispensable institution" for the advancement of peace, security, and collective well-being.“We're clear-eyed about the difficult work that needs to be done, from elevating human rights to reforming the UN itself, to addressing conflicts old and new around the world, and we look forward to engaging our allies and our partners to get it done. After all, we're stronger when we are working together," she had said in her brief remarks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-us-reaffirm-strategic-partnership-at-bilateral-meeting-of-un-envoys-101614561284845.html
01-03-2021||India||After two years, activity heats up at Cong war room||With the poll season here for four electorally significant states and a Union territory, the Congress party’s “war room” at 15, Gurdwara Rakabganj Road, is buzzing with activity after a long lull.The property with two conference rooms, a few cabins, a canteen and a separate unit for the Congress social media unit is in so much demand that senior party leaders who need to hold meetings for respective states or issues have to book in advance.“It’s like you have to send a request for a slot in one of the conference rooms. And often you would get a communication that the desired slot has already been taken by some other group,” said a senior Congress leader.Manish Chatrath, AICC incharge for Arunachal Pradesh and Meghalaya, also manages this prime estate in the heart of Lutyens’ Delhi for the party.The rising demand for the war room also coincides with the shrinking real estate space for the Congress in the national capital. Till two years ago, the party had spread out its activities in at least five places in central Delhi. It created separate spaces for research, data analysis, social media, and liaison while the core poll activities took place at the property on 15, Gurdwara Rakabganj Road.Now, some of these properties are no more used by the party’s backroom boys, said two leaders involved in the poll exercises.“Before the 2019 elections, a new operations room was created in a small bungalow in Lodhi Estate. The property hosted key meetings related to strategy, campaign and even data analysis. Every evening, a host of senior leaders would meet there. But now, that bungalow is not used any more,” said a second senior leader.The activity at 15, Gurdwara Rakabganj Road, therefore, has increased manifold. Officially, the property belongs to a Rajya Sabha member of the Congress. But it has been refurbished as a highly secure office. While Congress president Sonia Gandhi has never visited the place, Rahul Gandhi has frequently come for key meetings.“No Congress leader, except the general secretaries and above, can enter the place without prior appointment. If your name is not given to the private security guards at the main gate, you will be denied entry,” said another Congress leader handling affairs of an eastern state.Such is the level of security that except a few top leaders, no one can take their cars inside even as there is ample parking space. A few years ago, a biometric entry and exit system was put in place for the regulars. “The social media team that works from the same property uses a separate gate altogether and their office has been walled off,” said a person familiar with the matter.While the office décor and style of work remains the same, it has, however, lost Ahmed Patel, one of the few senior leaders who would come almost daily at the war room. One of the office cabins would be allotted to Patel, who died due to Covid complications, before every election. After many years, the Congress is going to the polls without Patel in the war room.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-two-years-activity-heats-up-at-cong-war-room-101614561039366.html
01-03-2021||India||Cong’s Ghulam Nabi Azad hails PM Modi for ‘not forgetting roots’||Former Rajya Sabha member and senior Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad on Sunday praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi for not forgetting his roots despite becoming the country’s PM.Azad said PM Modi speaks frankly about his past as a tea-seller and does not try to hide his background from the world.Addressing a function by Gujjar Desh Charitable Trust in Jammu, the former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister said people should learn from the PM about how one remains grounded to their roots. Azad’s comments come day after Congress leaders who recently wrote a letter to party president Sonia Gandhi held a well-attended public rally from the podium of Gandhi Global Family.On February 9, the PM gave an emotional farewell speech to Azad when the latter retired from the Rajya Sabha. “I (will) not let you retire, I will continue taking your advice. My doors are always open for you,” Modi said.An emotional Prime Minister had recalled how Azad had reached out to him in 2006 after tourists from Gujarat were killed in a terrorist attack and had said the person who will replace the Congress leader will find it tough to match his contribution.Addressing the function on Sunday, Azad said: “I have seen that when some among the Gujjar community become MLAs, they feel that they shouldn’t be called Gujjars and some feel shy that they come from villages”.“I like many things of many big leaders… like I am from a village and I feel proud of it. Our PM also says that he is from village and was nothing (non-entity) and that he washed utensils and sold tea. Politically we may have serious differences and are opposed to him but he didn’t hide his true self. And those who hide their true self, they live in a bubble… in an imaginary world. People should be proud of their roots,” he added.Azad said: “I have travelled across the world, stayed in five star and seven star hotels but when I sit with my people in village, I get a real sense of satisfaction...their clothes may not be clean but the soil of village has a different fragrance. You don’t need cosmetic scents because we are born and have grown up there.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congs-ghulam-nabi-azad-hails-pm-modi-for-not-forgetting-roots-101614560885006.html
01-03-2021||India||Year into pandemic, economy in polarised place||India’s first case of domestic transmission of Covid-19 was detected on March 2, 2020. This set the stage of restrictions on mobility to prevent infections from spreading. It was on March 24 that Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced a comprehensive nationwide lockdown beginning March 25. This lockdown, which lasted for 68 days, was among the most stringent in the world and virtually brought all non-essential economic activities to a halt. India’s GDP plunged by 24.4% in the first quarter (April-June) of 2020-21.The economy has gradually recovered and come back in expansion zone in the third quarter (October-December) with a GDP growth of 0.4%. Almost all forecasts expect things to improve going forward. Does this mean the economy has overcome the pandemic’s disruption? Answering this question requires nuance, especially given the lack of crucial necessary empirical evidence. With this caveat in place, one can summarise the economic trajectory over the last one year.Economic activity suffered a massive disruption, but was restored as lockdown restrictions were removedFear of the virus had started disrupting economic activity, especially in the service sector, even before the imposition of the lockdown. This increased significantly post-lockdown. Trends in India’s Purchasing Managers’ Indices (PMI) capture this clearly. PMI Services collapsed to just 5.4 in April 2020. A PMI value below 50 signifies contraction in economic activity compared to previous month. With gradual easing of lockdown-related restrictions, things started improving, but it was not until October 2020 that both the manufacturing and services PMI came back in expansion zone. Other high frequency indicators, such as the Nomura India Business Resumption Index (NIBRI) tell a similar story. NIBRI was reported to be at 99.3 – 100 being the pre-pandemic base – in the week ending February 21.Indian economy will still end up with a lower GDP than it had before the pandemicTo be sure, this sequential recovery will not be enough to compensate for the pandemic’s loss in the current fiscal year. India’s GDP is expected to contract by 8% on an annual basis in 2020-21. This will not be the first GDP contraction in independent India, but it will be the largest ever. Also, this is the only time India will suffer an economic contraction entirely on account of developments in the non-farm economy. Agricultural gross value added (GVA) is expected to grow at 3%, and it has provided a timely cushion to the otherwise crisis-ridden economy. An international comparison of growth rates shows that India will be among the worst-affected economies by Covid-19, suffering the 8th largest contraction among the 30 countries for which IMF’s World Economic Outlook has given GDP growth rates. Job markets, especially for blue collar workers, might still be in bad shapeEven the high frequency indicators, which portray a sequential recovery in the economy, have been warning that the employment has not recovered as fast as production. This is especially true for the blue-collar workforce, which did not have the option of working remotely during the lockdown. The sudden lockdown inflicted a huge shock to India’s migrant workforce, whose earnings are important drivers of consumption spending in some of India’s poorest and largest states. To be sure, not all of the headwinds to wages are because of the social-distancing restrictions. Earnings results show that companies have squeezed labour and other costs to maintain, even improve profits despite sales and revenues declining. That wages face headwinds in the economy can be seen from the fact that real rural wages have been contracting for four consecutive months beginning August 2020.A prolonged squeeze on wages does not bode well for mass demand in the economy. There are both bulls and bears in the economy right nowThe Indian economy, a year after the pandemic struck it, is a polarised place. There are sections, especially among the well-off, which believe that the worst is over for the economy and the future promises unmitigated and perhaps even unprecedented growth. This can be seen in the current exuberance in the stock markets and euphoria around critical second-generation reforms and aggressive disinvestment proposals presented in this year’s Budget. The P-E multiple in BSE, which measures price of stocks to their earnings is at an all-time high, suggesting that it is future prospects rather than current earnings that are encouraging investors to put more money in the market. On the other hand, overall consumer sentiment, as measured by the RBI’s Consumer Confidence Survey, continues to be in the red. When read with the weakness in labour markets and shifting balance of power in favour of capital, this does not sound very surprising. Such a glaring mismatch between economic sentiments cannot go on forever, and one of these will have to converge with the other. We do not have enough empirical evidence to say what direction this alignment will eventually take.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/year-into-pandemic-economy-in-polarised-place-101614558955632.html
01-03-2021||India||Dispatch X: A columnist looks back||For 10 months last year, at least five days a week, very rarely more, even more rarely less, I wrote a column on the coronavirus disease, Covid-19. It was mostly focused on science and data — the two things that I have maintained are needed to fight Covid-19 — although there were digressions into economics, the nature of work and play, literature, and music.I stopped writing the column on January 1. It was the day India announced the launch of the vaccine — and it was, I believed (and still do), the beginning of the end. Sure, Covid-19 will be around for a long time; it may never be eradicated; but the vaccines render it powerless.There’s been a lot to write about since then, and there are times I have considered restarting the column. The mutant strains of the Sars-CoV-2 virus have really come into their own in recent months, and we learn about them with every passing day. India has made several avoidable missteps in its vaccination drive, just like it did with its testing protocols in the initial days of the pandemic. And the number of cases in the country appears to be on the rise, although it is still around a sixth of the peaks seen last year, and the fact that I have repeatedly got it wrong about a second wave (something I am delighted about because who would wish for one?) stops me from terming it as such.There has been no let-up in the volume of scientific papers being published on the virus, its effects, and vaccines and other treatments, and I continue to read a lot more scientific literature than I did before the outbreak of the disease — December in China, and early March in India — when the first local cases were registered.We knew little about coronaviruses (although they weren’t unknown) before the pandemic. We would have known a lot less if not for Sars, which emerged in 2002-03, flared up, and then died out. Over the past year we have learnt more about the virus itself, details that point to a level of sophistication unseen in other viruses, and aimed at increasing its power to infect cells. This has resulted in a plausible theory about its bio-engineered origins in a laboratory somewhere in China, but it’s just as plausible that the virus jumped from bats to humans through an intermediate species, picking up some weaponry along the way. Sars-CoV-2 isn’t as lethal as some other viruses but it is highly infective, and the combination perhaps makes it among the most dangerous pathogens humans have faced. Someday (soon, maybe) we will understand the evolutionary journey of the virus, and, if our scars are healed by then, perhaps even marvel at it.We have answers, at least partial ones to many questions — why the virus affects some more adversely than it does others? Why some people become superspreaders? Why the death toll in the US and the UK are high? And we do not have answers to others, including, for those of us in India, the mystery of the country’s Covid-19 numbers, or, if a smaller mystery-within-a mystery is needed, the reason for Uttar Pradesh and Bihar’s low Covid-19 infections and deaths. Or why, in general, states with good public health parameters have fared worse than those with poor ones.Beyond the numbers, though, history will record events of 2020 (and 2021) along three dimensions: scientific, government, and individual.The scientific response to Covid-19 has been staggering in its speed and ingenuity. All previous records for vaccine development have been broken, not once, not twice, not three times, but several times over. A clutch of repurposed drugs and some new ones are now available to treat Covid-19. Death and hospitalisation rates have progressively reduced (with some exceptions). Science is winning.The response of governments has been mixed — not surprising because of the scale and the complexity of the problem and the speed with which the disease emerged, and not surprising because governments have traditionally had an uneasy relationship with science and data, the only two things that should have, in ideal circumstances, driven their response to the pandemic. The Swedish, firm believers in science, seemed to turn their back on it in a strategy that was initially praised, then criticised, then acclaimed again, and finally debunked. For the record, I insisted all along that it was the wrong approach (not out of prescience but the understanding that when it came to pandemics, science could never be wrong). Still, while there were missteps (and there continue to be), and governments could have performed better than they did, and taken smarter decisions, they could just as easily have done worse on both counts.I just hope their experience with the pandemic has made governments realise what really matters (in this case, to repeat myself, science and data).Meanwhile, people adapted — to no jobs or those that paid less than they did before the pandemic; to constantly wearing masks; to social distancing, isolation, and quarantines; to not dining out or travelling; to working from home (or not working from home); to studying from home; and to many other things that would have seemed strange just a year ago.And so, scientists shone, governments faltered to varying degrees, and the rest of us, well, did what we do best — we coped.P.S: The last column I wrote on Covid-19, Dispatch 238, appeared on January 2. My colleague Kunal Pradhan who edited most of the columns, and who had gotten into the practice, once I crossed 100 columns, of telling me which cricketer had scored as much as the day’s column number, and why it mattered, was stumped. As it turns out, a few days later, on January 5, New Zealand’s Kane Williamson made 238, and it turned out to be a record because 238, until then, had been the lowest score never to be made by a batsman (which basically meant all scores between, and including 0 and 237 had been made by at least one batsman). It’s just that we didn’t know it at the time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dispatch-x-a-columnist-looks-back-101614558567411.html
01-03-2021||India||India's 1st Covid fatality: In Kalaburagi, memories of a harrowing time persist||It was a joyous occasion on February 29, 2020, when 76-year-old Mohammed Hussain Siddiq returned from Umrah, a pilgrimage undertaken by Muslims, in Saudi Arabia. Several people thronged to get a glimpse of Siddiq, a Qazi or religious clergyman and well-known personality near Osmania Colony in the Ring Road area of Kalaburagi, about 579km from Bengaluru. Siddiq has nine children, and six of them were present at home surrounded by people from the locality.But the joy quickly turned to anxiety as Siddiq fell ill a few days later.A family doctor treated Siddiq and later recommended that they take him to the hospital where proper treatment can be administered. One of his sons, Faisal Siddiq, took his father to Sunrise Hospital in the same city where they spent 10 agonising hours trying to find out the problem with Siddiq.“First they took the X-ray and said everything was okay. But after the CT Scan, they acted differently and asked us to take my father to Hyderabad (230km away) for treatment,” Faisal, 50, said. Thus began one of the most harrowing ordeals for the family as they went to one hospital after another with a certificate from Sunrise, detailing that Siddiq was indeed Covid-19 positive. Just one day ago, Karnataka had reported its first Covid-19 case in Bengaluru, and there was no clarity on how to deal with a virus the world knew little about, let alone predict it would turn into a global pandemic.Siddiq was admitted to a private hospital in Hyderabad and even given an estimated bill of ₹1 lakh per day for treatment. But half an hour later, the hospital called Faisal to the office and asked him to take his father back to Kalaburagi.On the way back in an ambulance, Siddiq breathed his last, becoming the first fatality of Covid-19 in India, spreading panic among the population and around the home of the clergyman. “If the hospital had sent us to a government hospital, my father would have been alive today,” Faisal said.In Bengaluru, K Sudhakar, then medical education minister, at his daily Covid-19 briefing, gave an inaccurate account of what happened in Kalaburagi. His version that Siddiq was taken from a government hospital was inaccurate as health department officials the previous day had specifically mentioned it was a private facility. Reporters pointed out the inconsistent account, and Sudhakar chided senior health officials that further added to the confusion around the incident and the government’s clear lack of cohesion and comprehension of the developing health crisis.The ordeal for the family continued as local media continued to report on the story, adding to growing fears around the virus. “For about three-four months, people would see us and run away. They thought that I, too, may have contracted it,” Faisal said.One sister, who lives with her husband in another locality, later tested positive, and so did the family doctor, attracting more scrutiny. The religious undertones to the incident added to the misinformation and bigotry on the social media.With an imminent lockdown in sight, news and mind space were occupied with the virus. More so for the Siddiq family, which was not even allowed to properly grieve their loss.Karnataka has since seen nearly 1 million Covid-19 cases in the state, and the health crisis has been turned into another occurrence, despite its potent threat, and vapourised the stigma around it. Every new case became a statistic in the bulletin in the state and country. At least 11 million people in India and 114 million globally have contracted the virus.At least 12,350 people lost their lives in Karnataka alone, just as hundreds of thousands more around the country and planet. In India, 161,000 people have lost their lives. This number stands at 2.5 million globally.But the pandemic has deeply impacted those who lost their families and loved ones to the pandemic. Millions more lost their livelihoods and left a lasting impact that may take years to heal.“We keep away from our relatives who kept away from us due to the incident,” Faisal said.“Bure waqt pe jo saath nahin rehte, unka kya kehna (but what to say about those who don’t stand with you in the bad times). We also stay away from them, gathered our lives and moved on.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indias-1st-covid-fatality-in-kalaburagi-memories-of-a-harrowing-time-persist-101614557928275.html
01-03-2021||India||From 1st Covid-19 patient, a call to dispel stigma||When Rohit Dutta landed at Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International Airport on February 25, all he was looking forward to was his 12-year-old son’s birthday party in three days. A textile entrepreneur, Dutta had gone to Italy for a two-week trip with two male relatives, one of countless business trips he undertook over the years.That night, the 45-year-old man felt a fever coming, but went back to sleep. The next morning, he popped a pill and went to the local doctor. He was prescribed medicines for the next three days and his symptoms improved quickly.His course of pills ended on February 28. The same day, he threw a function for his son’s birthday at Hyatt Regency in south Delhi. At night, he felt the fever was back.By then, Dutta had seen news flashes of Covid-19 ravaging northern Italy, where he had gone. He was worried. With his symptoms not subsiding, on February 29, Dutta went to Ram Manohar Lohia hospital for a Covid-19 test.On March 2, his results came back positive — making him the first known patient in Delhi and one of only five people in India at the time.“When I had the infection, I did not know much about the disease. Nobody did,” he said.He was treated at Safdarjung hospital, one of the only two hospitals designated for treatment of Covid-19 at the time. He had mild symptoms — just fever and cough — and was given supportive care. “I had thought after a 14-day isolation I would go back to my life as usual, and after the lockdown, everything would go back to normal. I never imagined that so many people would get infected,” said Dutta.His health didn’t deteriorate but he had another big challenge: A constant stream of abuse and stigma directed at his family after his personal details were leaked.From his hospital bed, he saw his phone number, photographs, and even details about his two children put on the public domain. He had to block 1,500 phone numbers to stop anonymous callers abusing him.“I even registered an online police complaint but nothing much happened. In fact, my discharge papers were in the news before my doctors or I got to see it,” he said.A resident of Mayur Vihar, Dutta says Covid-19 changed his life in other, more common ways. He meets only one friend at a time instead of a minimum of five-people get-togethers. “I miss going to the mall. Also, I am a businessman and there are certain things for which I need to meet my clients face-to-face, but travelling has become very difficult now. God willing, this year will see the end of it,” he said.He added: “It is still okay for us, but children are missing out on their childhood.”In the first few months, he felt he was being shunned or judged by the people around him. “There was so much in the news about me – and at that time there was a lot of stigma about Covid-19 – so when people used to talk among themselves, I felt they were talking about me,” he said, before realising it wasn’t so.“Too much information” about the virus also had him worried. “I used to tell anyone who would ask that it was a good thing that I got the infection early on and recovered. However, as I started reading more and more about the infection and found out there was a possibility of long-term lung damage, I was concerned.”It was his doctors who put his mind at ease.“It is like vaccinating a child, we do not really know about all the vaccines but we have faith in our doctors. My doctors have already taken the shot and I have faith in the vaccine,” he said. “I will take it when my turn comes.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/from-1st-covid-19-patient-a-call-to-dispel-stigma-101614557054719.html
01-03-2021||India||Crucial lessons to be learnt from Covid-19 outbreak||In a year since the start of the Covid-19 outbreak in India, more than 11 million people have been infected and more than 160,000 have lost their lives. And while India has managed to control its first wave (and so far, only major wave) of infections, how the pandemic unfolded through the year has left behind troves of data on the virus spread in both statistical as well as epidemiological terms.Through the past year, government-assigned as well as independent data scientists across the country embarked on a massive tracking exercise that studied the spread of the virus in the country. Not only has this data given a clear in-depth view of how the virus covered the entire country in a matter of months, but it also showed how the first wave of the outbreak eventually receded.Within that data also lie crucial lessons to be learnt (especially given how cases are again inching up in the past few weeks). It can reveal what signs emerge at the start of a Covid wave so governments and people can brace for a fresh spike.How the pandemic unfoldedWhile the first batch of cases was reported in India on March 2, the first month or so of the spread of the disease in the country mostly consisted of infections being reported in people who travelled abroad, or their families, friends, colleagues and neighbours. The cases were mostly confined to metros that saw a large influx of international travellers, with Delhi, Mumbai and Chennai becoming the early areas of concentration of infections.Since much of the first month of the outbreak, March 2020 -- there were a couple of isolated cases in Kerala in January, but the Covid outbreak in India really began in March -- had no restrictions on movement of people, infections slowly stopped being confined to isolated clusters within cities (like buildings or localities), and a slow but steady trickle of cases started emerging across several states. The national lockdown kicked in only on March 25.Fuelled by cases from the three metros mentioned above, Maharashtra, Delhi and Tamil Nadu started emerging as India’s first hot-spot states by the start of April. In the first week for April, nearly half of all cases across India were coming from just these three regions – Maharashtra was responsible for 19% of all new infections, Tamil Nadu 15%, and Delhi 12%.These three regions remained the biggest contributors to the national tally through the next two months – May and June. No other state came close to reporting the kind of infection numbers these three were exhibiting at the time. It wasn’t until late July that the outbreak started swelling uncontrollably in other regions of the country. The first state other than the “Big Three” was Andhra Pradesh. This again followed a trajectory much like the ones before it – one or two hot spot regions emerge first, which later lead to a steady stream of infections to other regions. Karnataka (with Bengaluru becoming a hot spot) followed quickly on its heels.It wasn’t until early August that cases swelled in “other” regions. An important point worth noting is that the “other” category in the chart refers to a grouping of 30 states or Union Territories, which really puts into perspective just how big the numbers were from the states that saw the outbreak first— Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Delhi, and later Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka.The regions affected first carried India’s tally in the initial months of the outbreak; “other” states started swelling after August, when the country saw cases that were truly spread across the nation—breaking away from the hot spot-centered spread.This phenomenon is not limited to just India, and is very crucial to understanding how this virus spreads across the world. The trend of a handful of hot spot regions emerging first, then a heavy and steady stream of cases from medium-population regions, was identical in nearly every major country that has seen outbreaks.In the US, New York City (and later NY state) along with California were the first hotbeds of the virus, before it ripped through the Midwest and South. The same trend was visible in Brazil, where the virus first clustered around São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro before it ravaged the rural parts of the country. In the UK, London and was the first outbreak centre before cases emerged throughout the country.On the other end, when cases started receding, this phenomenon worked entirely in reverse. The drop in cases was generally fuelled by hot spot regions first, and then the “other” regions brought their outbreak in control. When the Indian wave peaked mid-September, seven regions – Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Delhi, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh and Kerala – were responsible for 64% of all infections in the country, while the 30 “other” state/UTs were only responsible for 36%. The fall in overall numbers started with the former group seeing a massive drop in infections. On the week India’s wave peaked (September 16, 2020) Maharashtra’s share in the country’s infection was 24%. In the next two months, the state’s contribution to new infections across the country dropped to 9%. Similarly, Tamil Nadu’s share went from 20% in early August to 5% by the end of November. On the other end, the “other” states were responsible for 36% of India’s infections on September 16, and their share rose to 47% by November-end.Learning from the trendThe reason this “hot spot first, then wider spread” trend is crucial is because it can serve as a harbinger for second waves, or warn of wider trends of resurgence. While a lot of has been written about the recent increase in cases in a handful of states (led by Maharashtra) what is alarming is that the trend is following nearly the same pattern as before.Cases swelled in Maharashtra first, which was followed by Punjab, Madhya Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh, while Kerala remained a hot spot from the first wave. Now cases are again rising in cities like Delhi -- around 250 a day over the past three days from as low as 130 on the three corresponding days a week ago.At a time when travel restrictions across the country are at the lowest levels since the start of the outbreak, it would not be surprising if the first wave’s “hot spot first, then wider spread” trend starts to resurface. Currently, the country is at the first phase of this trend with a handful of hot spots regions emerging. Unless some drastic measures are taken to control the spread of the virus in these regions immediately, the second phase of this trend that would see a massive increase in cases across the country soon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lessons-from-the-coronavirus-outbreak-101614556483978.html
01-03-2021||India||Eatery owner’s son dies after being shot by terrorists in J&K||The son of the owner of popular eatery who was shot by suspected terrorists on February 17 near his shop, succumbed to his injuries at a hospital in Srinagar in the wee hours on Sunday.Suspected terrorists had opened fire on Aakash Mehra,25, outside Krishan Dhaba on February 17.“He died early morning, “ SSP Srinagar Haseeb Mughal told HT. Mehra was being treated at Shri Maharaja Hari Singh hospital in Srinagar where he was on ventilator. “He lost his life at around 3 am. He had bullet injuries in his chest,”said medical superintendent of SMHS Hospital, Nazir Choudhary. Police have already arrested three persons suspected to be involved in the attack.IG Kashmir Vijay Kumar on February 19 had said that they have also recovered the bike and pistol used in the attack. He said that the three were “newly recruited” terrorists.Srinagar Mayor Junaid Mattoo said expressed his condolences. “Woke up to extremely distressing news. Young Akash Mehra who was shot at by terrorists at Krishna Dhaba has succumbed to his injuries at SMHS Hospital. I share the pain and grief of his family and stand by them as they mourn this inconsolable loss. May his soul rest in peace, “ he said.Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) chief Mehbooba Mufti also expressed her condolences. “Shocked & saddened to know that Akash Mehra who ran Krishna Dhaba in Srinagar succumbed to his injuries after being shot at by Terrorists. May his soul rest in peace & deepest condolences to the bereaved family, “ she tweeted.Expressing grief over the death, BJP leader Kavinder Gupta on Sunday said, “We heard the sad news about the death of Krishna Dhaba’s owner’s son. This type of targeted attack is proof that there are still ongoing attempts to oust the minorities from the region. We will not tolerate such activities... It is very important to stop such attacks.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/eatery-owner-s-son-dies-after-being-shot-by-terrorists-in-jk-101614555663738.html
01-03-2021||India||How Covid pandemic hit the justice system||The justice system entered the year 2020 in ill-health and chronic co-morbidities of infrastructure both human and physical, inadequate representation, a historical burden of judicial pendency, and prison overcrowding. And while it may take some time to assess the impact of the pandemic on pre-existing deficits, some early projections can be made.For instance, according to National Judicial Data Grid there was a 66% drop in cases filed between April-June 2020 compared to the same period in 2019. Even if half of these cases are filed now that the courts have begun functioning, in the next few months, the pent up demand added to the already pending 43 million cases will pose a near insurmountable challenge to the courts.The second edition of the India Justice Report, which used 87 metrics across police, prisons, judiciary and legal aid systems, offered a ready reckoner of the justice system as a whole. One of the biggest deficits, the report points out, is the extent of vacancies across all four pillars. In the judiciary, on average, one in three judges in the High Court and one in four among subordinate judges were yet to be hired.Thus, it is critical to address and repair the deficits, whether of human resource, or budget allocation or technology adoption or training capacity — a small sample of the factors we have been measuring in our reports — as we begin to assess the effect of the pandemic.To start with, a vital lesson that we must take on board immediately is to consider the delivery of justice, through courts and legal aid clinics, an essential service. If there was one thing we learnt from 2020 it was the absolute importance of locally available accessible service: whether of food, healthcare or employment. This must be applicable to justice too.While prisons and police services were included by the Union home ministry in the list of services that remained functional during the lockdowns, courts and legal aid services were not. It is time we reflect on how to make our justice system disaster-ready and functional in all situations.To be sure, a great many of the frailties of structure and performance have ailed the justice system for a long time.IJR 2020 reveals that on average, police stations serve much larger areas in rural India as compared to cities. In Andhra Pradesh, for instance, the area coverage of a rural police station was nearly 12 times its urban counterpart (224 sq km to 19 sq km). In Uttar Pradesh, the area served by rural police stations is roughly 16 times that of an urban police station (235 sq km to 16 sq km).Even free legal aid — guaranteed under the Constitution — is unavailable to a great many despite National Legal Services Authority’s mandate that there should be one legal services clinic for a reasonable cluster of villages. The IJR reveals that nationally, there is only one clinic for 42 villages. In states like UP and Odisha, there is just one for over 500 and 300 villages respectively.These frailties are compounded by rigidly hierarchical internal cultures that resist accountability. They remain unrepaired because of inattention to ensure that every worker complies with constitutional imperatives bereft of social prejudice, and is also trained and skilled upregularly to fulfil their mandates. Covid-19 and the lockdown only highlighted this state of unpreparedness.To be sure, despite challenges of money and manpower, there has been improvement across the four pillars over time. Women personnel in the police went up to 10% from 7% in the first IJR; between 2018 and 2020, 28 states/Union Territories have managed to reduce the share of cases pending for more than five years, and nationally, the utilisation of NALSA funds has improved to 94.2% from 70.7% in the first IJR.However, treating all the pillars of social justice as an essential service — which cannot be suspended at any point in time and which every citizen, irrespective of their location, can take for granted — would go a long way in reifying institutional improvement.What would it take for this to happen?For one, policy makers and duty-holders need to coordinate efforts across police prisons judiciary and legal aid to identify urgent repairs than can be put in place without much more strain on resources. Illustratively, ensure diversity – has a first call when recruiting, prioritise resources so that legal services are available at the door step of the remotest hamlets and villages: this could mean increasing the number of police chowkies in rural areas to investing in rapid skilling up of magistrates, constables, panel lawyers, and jailors who are first responders.The Supreme Court has repeatedly affirmed that access to justice is a fundamental right. Its realisation has faltered too long. The delivery of quality justice must now be seen as a priority and become real in the lives of everyone.(Maja Daruwala is the chief editor of the India Justice Report 2020.

01-03-2021||India||Urban areas still more vulnerable to coronavirus but cases now evenly spread||March 2 marks a year since India detected its first Covid-19 case which was transmitted locally, and when the cycle of infections in the country began. While India seems to have so far escaped a second wave of Covid-19 infections, tracking the geography of the pandemic in the country over the last one year makes for an interesting analysis. The pandemic initially started in urban areas, proliferated to rural India once lockdown restrictions were eased, and was eventually distributed across urban and rural regions. To be sure, the impact on rural areas was not as devastating as scientists and health care experts had first feared, and urban areas are still more vulnerable to new infections. Here are three charts which explain this in detail.The pandemic’s urban bias has come down over timeBecause the Covid-19 virus came via international travellers, urban areas were the first ones to get affected in India. A district-wise analysis of Covid-19 cases shows this clearly. For the purpose of this analysis India’s 700-plus districts have been classified into five categories on the basis of rural population share: entirely urban (less than 20% rural population), largely urban (20%-40% urban population), mixed (40%-60% rural population), largely rural (60%-80% rural population) and entirely rural (more than 80% rural population). All of Delhi’s eleven revenue districts have been clubbed as one, as Delhi does not provide district-wise Covid-19 data.To be sure, these districts have different share of India’s population.As per the 2011 census estimates, the population share of entirely urban, largely urban, mixed, largely rural and entirely rural districts was 6%, 8%, 14%, 34% and 39% respectively.A distribution of new Covid-19 cases in these groups shows that the entirely urban districts, even though they had just 6% of India’s population, were the biggest source of new infections. This share was 30% in March 2020 and increased to more than 50% in May 2020. This share has fallen steadily and was just 11.3% in February 2020 (data up to February 24). The entirely urban districts show a similar trajectory when it comes to new deaths due to Covid-19, although this share is slightly higher than that for new infections. To be sure, the share of largely urban districts in these numbers has started increasing in 2021.This does not mean urban population is not vulnerable anymoreThe declining share of urban districts in new cases and deaths should not be inferred as evidence of large-scale immunity in urban areas. This is because a simple share in new cases and deaths does not tell us about the infection and deaths rates in these regions. Adjusting new cases and deaths by population of these districts puts things into perspective. While both these numbers have come down sharply since late 2020, urban districts still have much higher infection and death rates than their rural counterparts, which underlines the importance of maintaining caution. The pandemic has become geographically skewed once againHT’s Covid-19 dashboard has daily district-wise case numbers from March 14, 2020. In the first week, only five districts – Delhi (all revenue districts combined), Hyderabad, Leh, Jaipur and Bhilwara – accounted for half of the new Covid-19 cases (seven-day average) in India.The geographical spread of the pandemic was contained until the lockdown restrictions prevented movements of persons across the country. It started spreading once restrictions were eased, and rose at a sharp pace between July-September 2020. By September 19, 2020, 51 districts accounted for half of new Covid-19 cases in the country.This number started declining since then; displayed a small spike in December last year and has plateaued after falling to just above 10 since January 2021.The geographical concentration of the pandemic becomes even clearer if one looks at it on a map of India. In September 2020, Covid-19 cases were spread across the country.Currently, Kerala and Maharashtra seem to be the major clusters of the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/urban-areas-still-more-vulnerable-to-coronavirus-but-cases-now-evenly-spread-101614553700113.html
01-03-2021||India||One year of Covid-19: How India fought the virus||There are several ways to look at India’s Covid-19 year. On the face of it, it’s the story of a country battered by the world’s second-highest number of infections. The country’s 1.3 billion-plus people spent more fatigued weeks in a hard lockdown than most others and, in turn, faced one of the sharpest economic contractions seen anywhere in the world.At least 11 million have contracted the virus, and close to 160,000 died due to it.But, it is also a story of intrigue and, often, surprise. It has one of the lowest deaths rates seen in any large country and, leaving out trends that have become visible only in the latest fortnight, gone through only a single, gigantic wave of infections that appeared to be well-controlled by the country’s precarious health infrastructure.In March of 2020, when the world first caught a glimpse of the devastation that the coronavirus would go on to unleash, experts feared India would suffer heavily as well. Tried-and-tested epidemiological models predicted 97,000-1.3 million infections by mid-May, to perhaps even 300 million infections by the end of the year.But, largely, the worst of the fears did not pan out. During the highest of the infection peaks, hospitals appeared to be on top of the situation – unlike in New York or Milan. The season of festivals, which touches almost every region, religion and custom in the pre-winter months of October-November, led to spikes, but not of the nature seen in other parts of the world. “Reported cases mean very little in India. The estimated number of true infections from models as well as sero surveys is huge and point to about 20-25% of the adult population being infected. That is nearly 170-200 million infections,” said Bhramar Mukherjee, the chair of biostatistics at the University of Michigan School of Public Health.Even if one takes this into account and looks at fatalities to calculate what is known as the infection fatality rate (IFR), she added, India’s story seems different. “Even if you believe not all deaths were reported, this points to a low IFR compared to the rest of the world,” she added.India’s IFR is 0.1% and this number may be a better measure of an epidemic since deaths are more likely to be recorded than infections, particularly in the case of a disease like Covid-19, which infects many without symptoms. But, Mukherjee added, “41% of India’s population is in the age group 0-18, in which the infection rate is really low -- so the age-adjusted mortality does not look as low as the overall one.”In the week beginning March 2, there were nearly 50 cases. The infected were not only those who had history of recent international travel, but, for the first time, were also people who picked it up locally. The month of March is crucial – not only because this is when the nationwide lockdown would come into force later – but because the most critical first step of a scientific response to an epidemic was missing: Testing.It would not be until March 20 that authorities would allow a person without a travel history to take a Covid-19 test. But people would still be eligible only if they had symptoms, travel history or high-risk contacts – a condition that was relaxed in September.The most effective intervention, then, was a crude one: the hard, 68-day lockdown that began on March 25. It was also unique since India was the only country that shut down while cases were still low, and actually surmounted the peak while reopening.According to Mukherjee, the lockdown did not help stop transmission in the end but it “really helped us scale up health care”. “Testing became accessible and affordable, and isolation beds, ICUs, Covid care centres were set up. That helped reduce mortality. After opening up when cases surged and hospital beds were filling up, we were much more prepared,” she said, while adding that the hard lockdown also helped send a message of seriousness from authorities, “which was not the case all over the world.”SK Sarin, the director of Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences, headed Delhi government’s first committee on Covid-19 control and management. Having been on the frontlines in the fight in the Capital, he identified several things that helped eventually, but the first was to plan for infection surges: “Even in the initial days, we planned for situations in which 1,000 or even 5,000 cases were reported in a day.”Then, he added, protocols were defined to manage the various ways in which the disease manifested. “We also worked on scaling up testing. ILBS had one of the biggest labs at that time with a capacity for conducting 1,000 RT-PCR tests a day. And Delhi was the first to set up the flu clinics in hospitals to check patients coming in for symptoms of Covid-19.”But this was the story of Delhi, the country’s capital. An analysis of infection and fatality trends suggests India’s rural regions reported similar fatality trends as more urbanised regions, where health infrastructure is arguably better.Mukherjee, who was among the dozen-odd researchers from three American universities who collaborated for the Crisis of Virus in India (COV-IND) study group, identifies the trends in rural India as particularly surprising. “I spent quite a bit of time in my parents’ farmhouse. In the villages they do not wear masks, and yet there were no severe cases that they could report. Our fear seemed like an urban myth or fiction to them. What happened there?”The second question of intrigue is the dramatic drop in infections in India. The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) in February released the latest nationwide sero survey that showed roughly four in five Indians was still vulnerable to an infection. Mukherjee described the end of the first wave as something that struck her, in addition to big festivals like Diwali and Dussehra not triggering major outbreaks. She notes that, as reflected in the sero surveys, which found higher exposure in cities compared to rural areas, the receding of the pandemic may perhaps be due to separate characteristics in these areas.“I think the antibodies in metros/urban areas are still protecting us from massive surges, but we cannot wait too long. Rural India is a mystery to me. I believe it is a confluence of cross-immunity, genetics, lifestyle, lower obesity and heart disease prevalence and also a more outdoor lifestyle with natural air ventilation that helped villages,” she said, while adding: “I really want to understand why despite tourism and travel by migrant workers, the number of infections remained low in rural areas.”Lalit Kant, the former head of epidemiology and infectious diseases at the Indian Council of Medical Research saw much progress in how India’s government and citizens have learned to manage the pandemic. “We have come a long way. This time in 2020, we did not know much about the virus or the treatment. There was an acute shortage of masks, PPE kits, sanitisers, and, when cases started rising, hospital beds. Many permutations and combinations of medicines were tried out and it took doctors some time to standardise the treatment, and this was happening across the globe.”But now, he added, “testing has since improved, including the quality of tests available and people’s awareness about the disease and how it spreads has increased, even if precautions are not followed all the time.”As the country turns the page on its first year of Covid-19, it will begin to open up the vaccination drive to its general public.Experts see this as the most crucial objective now. “It has been a year of challenge, but it has also showed the power of science. But, the virus is likely to persist. While there wouldn’t be big outbreaks like we saw last year, summers in India is when there is indoor time (staying indoors increases the risk of transmission) and if we do not take precautions there could be an increase in the number of cases, said Anurag Agarwal, director, CSIR-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology. “Also, by the time the peak summers come, immunity will decline from last years’ outbreak leaving more people susceptible. Over the next six months we just have to vaccinate, vaccinate, vaccinate.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/one-year-of-covid-19-how-india-fought-the-virus-101614553310402.html
01-03-2021||India||Covid-19 in India: Next phase of vaccine drive kick-starts today||The second phase of India’s vaccination drive against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) will begin on Monday, with the Union health ministry saying that those eligible for immunisation can register and book appointments from 9am to 3pm on March 1, as the country ramps up its battle against the infectious disease almost a year after the first cluster of cases in Delhi.From Monday, people eligible for the next phase can walk up to a vaccination centre to be registered for a dose. The decision will allow anyone above the age of 60 and those older than 45 but with comorbidities that make them more vulnerable to Covid-19 to approach government and private hospitals for shots. While the doses will be administered for free at government facilities, private hospitals can charge up to ₹250 per dose.“A lot of hard work has gone into reaching this phase wherein the government is beginning to vaccinate the general population. The vaccines are absolutely safe to use and are in use not just in India but in other countries as well,” said Union health minister Harsh Vardhan.A statement by the Union health ministry said: “There will be only one live appointment for a beneficiary at any point of time for each dose… Appointments for any date for a COVID Vaccination Center will be closed at 3pm on that day for which the slots were opened.”For example, for March 1, the slots will be open from 9am till 3pm and the appointments can be booked anytime before then, subject to availability. However, on March 1, an appointment can also be booked for any future date for which vaccination slots are available. The registration will take place on the upgraded Co-WIN platform and also on other government-approved mobile-based applications.“The next phase of the world’s largest vaccination drive for the age appropriate population groups will commence from 1st March 2021 (Monday). Registration will open at 9.00am on 1st March 2021 (at www.cowin.gov.in). Citizens will be able to register and book an appointment for vaccination, anytime and anywhere, using the COWIN 2.0 portal or through other IT applications such as Arogya Setu etc,” the official statement said.The immunisation drive across the country was halted for Saturday and Sunday to move to the new Co-WIN platform that will allow the self-registration of recipients.According to the health ministry’s Co-WIN guidelines issued on Sunday, one person will be able to register only three more eligible people using their mobile number. “With one mobile number, a person can register as many as four beneficiaries. However, all those registered on one mobile number will have nothing in common except the mobile number. The id card number for each such beneficiary must be different. A mobile number cannot be used for making more than four registrations. If one out of the four beneficiaries registered in an account is vaccinated, only three registrations are left, and so on,” said the guidelines.An appointment can also be booked for any future date for which vaccination slots are available. A slot for the second dose will also be booked at the same vaccination centre on 29th day of the date of the appointment of the first dose. If a beneficiary cancels the first-dose appointment, then the appointment of both doses will be cancelled, as per the guidelines.The nationwide vaccination drive was launched on January 16, with the government focusing on immunising 30 million health care and frontline workers in the first leg. In the second phase, it plans to vaccinate about 270 million people who are over the age of 60 or are aged at least 45 years and have comorbid conditions.Those with any of the 20 specified comorbidities will have to produce a medical certificate attested by a registered medical practitioner at the time of vaccination at the chosen vaccine centre. The conditions include congenital heart disease that leads to pulmonary arterial hypertension, end-stage kidney disease, or cancers such as lymphoma, leukaemia and myloma, decompensated liver cirrhosis (deterioration of liver function due to scarring), primary immune deficiency conditions, and sickle cell anaemia.“Detailed guidelines have been issued by the government after thorough deliberations by the experts to guide common people through the process. I urge all eligible persons, especially those with comorbidities, to take the shot. It is for their own good as there is still a large section of population susceptible to catching the infection,” said Dr VK Paul, member (health), Niti Aayog.The Capital reported its first case on March 2, when a 45-year-old who travelled from Italy tested positive. “The past one year has been really tough but our scientists and medical fraternity has risen to the occasion and has ensured that we do not lose too many lives to this pandemic. At about 1.4%, India’s death rate has remained lower than the global average throughout,” the Union health minister told HT.The Delhi health department said on Sunday that the next phase of vaccination in the Capital will begin from Monday. The drive will be carried out at 192 hospitals in the national capital, including 136 private hospitals and 56 government hospitals. Vaccination will be done six days a week at these centres.“Appointment for vaccination can be booked online prior registration and appointment based on available slots on COWIN portal,” the health department said. Delhi reported 197 fresh Covid-19 cases in the last 24 hours, taking the cumulative count of cases in Delhi to 639,289.The central government will procure vaccines and supply them free of cost to the states and Union Territories, who in turn will disburse them to government and private vaccination centres. The vaccines – Covishield and Covaxin are currently approved in India – will be available for free at government hospitals and at a capped price of ₹250 per dose at private hospitals. The cost will comprise ₹150 for the vaccine shot and ₹100 as operational charges.The vaccine type available at a vaccination centre, however, will not be displayed to citizens at the time of online registration. “A Covid vaccination centre shall usually have only one type of vaccine throughout the vaccination drive. This is necessary to avoid mixing of vaccine types in 1st and 2nd dose of a beneficiary,” said the government’s guidelines.Experts said it was imperative to open more vaccination centres for the process to pick up pace.“If we need to achieve our target, we need to have vaccination in more and more places; we have to open it up in a manner that those who are willing to take the vaccine are allowed to come rather than calling people and them not turning up,” said Dr Randeep Guleria, director, All India Institute of Medical Sciences.“People in the high-risk group residing in regions seeing a spurt in infections should be immunised quickly as it will help in decreasing the mortality and hospitalisations,” he added.Since the drive began last month, over 14 million doses have been administered across the country. But the coverage has been lower than expected, with only 48 people turning up on average for every 100 people expected for each session, according to government data.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-in-india-next-phase-of-vaccine-drive-kick-starts-today-101614552866500.html
01-03-2021||India||Elderly make the digital switch during Covid-19 pandemic||It is 11am on Friday and a digital literacy class has just begun on video communication platform Zoom. The learners — senior citizens aged 60 to 80 — are listening to the trainer, rapt; some are fervently jotting down notes. The first topic of the 15-day workshop is how to make a conference call on a smartphone. After 15 minutes of instructions, the participants are asked to make a conference call. Some flounder, but the faces of those who succeed brim with pride and amazement.“I did not know how to use this feature on my phone, though I needed it to connect with my family and friends. It is so easy,” says Om Prakash Goyal, 65, one of the most enthusiastic learners in the class, who took copious notes throughout the lesson. “But my prime objective is to learn how to book a doctors’ appointment, order medicines, and do banking online. The pandemic has made it necessary, ” says Goyal, a retired government engineer, who lives in Paschim Vihar.India has about 104 million people aged above 60 — just a shade below China —according to the 2011 Census. But digital inclusion has been a distant dream for them. The government’s National Digital Literacy Mission (NDLM) aims to empower at least one person per household. It, however, does not accord any priority to senior citizens. According to a survey by Agewell Foundation, an NGO, in 2018, among senior citizens in Delhi-NCR, around 86% of the 5,000 respondents were found to be digitally illiterate.But the pandemic has led to an exponential demand for digital skills among them, with senior citizens aged 60 to 85, turning to online workshops organised by NGOs, startups, volunteer groups. The lessons in these workshops, include smartphone use, digital payments, e-banking, e-shopping, booking an appointment with doctors online, using cab-hailing apps, and monitoring health through apps.“We get about 100 calls a day compared to 10 before the pandemic for our classes for seniors. Many of them are well-to-do and own expensive smartphones, but are unable to use them. Most say their children do not have time and patience to teach them digital skills,” says Himanshu Rath, founder, Agewell Foundation, which provides free online digital literacy classes for senior citizens. His organization’s digital training calendar is packed for the next few months.Santosh Kaul Ogra, 69, who coordinates with NGOs for digital literacy classes on behalf of many RWAs in Delhi, says that these days he is flooded with demands from senior citizens wanting to attend digital literacy workshops. “Their biggest concern is how to live with dignity during their old age,” says Ogra. “During pandemic they realized that the mobile phone is a powerful device, which they can use for information, entertainment, online transactions and connecting with friends and families.”Kusum Gupta, 77, from Saket, attended a digital literacy class last year. The skills she learnt, she says, are coming quite handy. These days, at 6am, she and her friends attend a yoga class on Zoom. “We are a group of about 20. Before the pandemic, we used to do yoga in the neighbourhood park but now, we do it online. Technology helped me remain connected with friends in these tough times of social distancing,” says Gupta. “My friends say I am quite a tech pro. I watch news, movies, listen to music on YouTube. But technology can help only if you don’t have any hearing or eyesight problems.”Earlier this week, Sushil Bawa, 70, a retired teacher in Rohini, decided to junk her paper diary for a calendar app. She is currently attending a digital literacy workshop. “Now I will use only my phone to get alerts about birthdays, anniversaries of my friends and family.I am also learning how to edit photos, make a photo collage to send personalized wishes to them on special occasions. It keeps me engaged,” says Bawa.Rajkumar Prajapati, 25, a digital trainer at Agewell Foundation, says, “Patience is the key while training elderly as you have to repeat things.” The questions he frequently faces include what is the difference between Chrome and Google; how can one look slimmer in photos, do Google Maps always give the right directions?Shreya Bajaj, 30, who in July launched Easy Hai, an initiative to impart digital skills to the elderly with her sister Surbhi, says demand for her Zoom sessions continues to grow. She charges ₹200 per session and organizes two sessions every day.“So far I have taught digital skills to over 5,000 people. During the lockdown, elderly members in my family struggled with technology. That is how this initiative was born. I have realized that every senior has his or her own digital competency level,” says Bangalore-based Shreya. “Initially, our participants were from Bangalore only; now they are also from Delhi, Chandigarh, Pune, Udaipur, Raipur.”Sonali Sharma, head, advocacy and elderly empowerment, HelpAge India, another NGO, which provides free digital training to seniors all across the country, says that of all the workshops her organization conducts for seniors, the digital training one is the most popular. “Demand for our digital classes is the highest in Hyderabad and Chennai, followed by Delhi. Most of our members are well- educated, middle-class senior citizens, wanting to use technology to live independent lives.”Agrees Saumyajit Roy, co-founder and CEO, Emoha Elder Care, a company that provides elderly care services, “Earlier, seniors who are our members, were quite hesitant about video calls and ordering things online. Now they feel it is better to acquire digital skills for their own safety and security. The pandemic has proved to be a catalyst for digital empowerment of the elderly.”Savita Verma, 64, has taken it upon herself to teach digital skills to her husband. “ I attend the class in the morning and take notes. In the evening, I teach him whatever I learn . I feel empowered and in control of my life, thanks to my newly acquired digital skills. It is really amazing how a smartphone can change your life.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/elderly-make-the-digital-switch-during-covid-19-pandemic-101614549593861.html
01-03-2021||India||Farmers in a do-or-die battle: Kejriwal at mahapanchayat||Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday described farmers as true patriots and alleged that fake cases were being lodged against them in the context of the agitation against the three new agriculture reform laws.Speaking at a Kisan Mahapanchayat in Meerut, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader termed the new laws as a “a death warrant” for farmers. He said the farmers were in a “do or die” battle because they felt the government would hand over their land to corporates and they would become labourers on their own land.He said that all the governments in the past 70 years cheated farmers on their demand for an appropriate price for their crops, adding, “but nothing happens after elections”.He also indicated that farmers had nothing to do with the violence that took place on Republic Day at the Red Fort during the farmers’ tractor rally.“What happened at Red Fort on January 26 was organised by them (he didn’t mention any names)” he said.“People met me thereafter and told (me) protesters were deliberately diverted from the prescribed route and those who hoisted a flag at the Red Fort were their workers. Our farmers can be anything but anti-nationals,” he added.He demanded that fake cases should not be registered against farmers.He also presented a formula for giving a guarantee to purchase 23 crops at minimum support price (MSP).Kejriwal said BJP leaders every day claimed MSP existed and it would remain. “I challenge Yogiji (UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath) to mention to me one mandi (market) in UP where crops were purchased at MSP,” he said.The Delhi chief minister also spoke about the issues of sugarcane payment, escalating electricity bills, rising prices of fuel and fertilizers.He appealed to the gathering to bring a government with clear intentions in the state to solve all their problems.“Bring a government with clear intentions and farmers would receive the payment before reaching their home after supplying sugarcane to mills,” he said as the crowd hailed him with slogans like “Arvind Kejriwal zindabad” and “desh ka neta kaisa ho Arvind Kejriwal jaisa ho”.The Aam Aadmi Party has already announced that it would contest the Uttar Pradesh assembly elections due in February-March next year.He said he was the first person who contacted Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) national spokesperson Rakesh Tikait after he burst into tears because of the “atrocities” on farmers at the Ghazipur border.“I was the first person to contact Rakesh Tikait on the phone and made arrangements for drinking water and toilets for farmers on his appeal,” the AAP leader said.Referring to the Delhi government’s free electricity scheme, he said, “I was also under tremendous pressure and told that power companies were powerful, therefore, we can’t do much for minimising power cuts and providing free electricity. But we did that.”AAP Rajya Sabha member Sanjay Singh, local farmer leaders and the party’s state president Sabhajeet Singh shared the dais with Kejriwal. Sanjay Singh and Sabhajeet Singh had visited many leaders of khaps (clan-based councils) to mobilise support for the mahapanchayat.The stage had photographs of former Prime Minister Chaudhary Charan Singh, one of the tallest farmer leaders of the country, and the late BKU chief Mahendra Singh Tikait.Kejriwal ended his speech with the slogan “Chaudhary Charan Singh Amar Rahe”.He also honoured khap chaudharies (khap leaders) on the stage and sought their blessings.Farmers have been protesting on different borders of the national capital since November 26 against the three newly enacted farm laws: Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; the Farmers Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and farm Services Act 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-in-a-do-or-die-battle-kejriwal-at-mahapanchayat-101614546148650.html
01-03-2021||India||Antigua begins process to revoke citizenship of Mehul Choksi||Antigua and Barbuda has initiated the process to cancel fugitive diamantaire Mehul Choksi’s citizenship granted under the Caribbean nation’s Citizenship by Investment Programme (CIP) in November 2017 but he has challenged the government’s move in court, people familiar with the matter said.News of Antigua’s decision to proceed against Choksi comes even as his partner-in-crime in the ₹13,500-crore fraud case, Nirav Modi, suffered a legal setback after a UK court ordered his extradition last week, people familiar with the matter said.Two officers in the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and Enforcement Directorate (ED) earlier said that Choksi’s citizenship was cancelled sometime last year and the fugitive businessman is fighting the order to revoke his citizenship in an Antiguan civil court.Vijay Aggarwal, Choksi’s lawyer in India, however, contested this version. “My client Mehul Choksi has clarified that he is very much an Antiguan citizen. His citizenship has not been revoked,” he said.Lionel Hurst, chief of staff to Antigua Prime Minister Gaston Browne, said the process to strip Choksi of his citizenship will take time to be completed.Hurst told news channel India Today that the government attempted to revoke Choksi’s citizenship but he filed a lawsuit in the High Court of Antigua and Barbuda.“This matter will take about seven years to be resolved. With enough money to pursue these legal challenges, 2027 is the earliest for a final resolution," Hurst said. Choksi can move the Court of Appeals and the Privy Council in London if he loses in the high court, he addedCBI and ED officials cited above said that as soon as Choksi exhausts his appeal against revocation of citizenship (Antigua decides on his citizenship), his extradition proceedings will begin as Antiguan Prime Minister Gaston Browne has already assured India of sending him back.According to a June 2019 report by Antigua Observer, Browne, while calling Choksi a “crook”, had said that his citizenship will be revoked as his reputation had tarnished the image of CIP. The CIP, run by CIU (Citizenship by Investment Unit) of Antigua allows a person to get citizenship of the island nation, which comes with visa-free travel to 132 countries, upon investment of $200,000.It also empowers the minister in-charge to revoke citizenship if it is “obtained by false representation, fraud or willful concealment of material facts”.In the absence of an extradition treaty between two countries, India sought Choksi’s extradition in August 2018 on the principle of reciprocity and dual criminality but it is pending due to the legal issues. The principle of dual criminality’ requires that the offence for which the extradition is sought has to be an offence in both the - requesting and requested - countries.The investigators are hopeful that Mehul Choksi’s extradition, once he loses his citizenship revocation appeals, will also come through as the evidence against him very strong, exactly like Nirav Modi as both indulged in the use of Letters of Undertaking (LoUs), dummy companies, destroying of evidence and intimidation of witnesses.Last Thursday, the UK court not only accepted CBI and ED’s evidence against Modi but it praised the nature of documents, audio/video files and testimonies gathered by the investigators.Mehul Choksi siphoned off close to ₹7,080 crore in the ₹13,578 crore PNB fraud before fleeing to Antigua on January 4, 2018, a month before the mega-scam came to notice.In a charge sheet filed last year, the ED claimed Choksi didn’t just cheat Indian banks but customers and lenders in Dubai and the United States as well. His assets worth ₹2,500 crore have already been attached.Editor’s Note: A previous version of this article has been edited for a factual mistake.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/antigua-revokes-citizenship-of-mehul-choksi-101614540096186.html
01-03-2021||India||New rules make way for self-regulation: I&B ministry secretary||The secretary in the ministry of information and broadcasting, Amit Khare, said on Saturday that the country was for the first time moving from censorship to self-regulation, even as critics have taken on the government for being “authoritarian” with new online media guidelines.“There will be no authoritarian process,” Khare told Hindustan Times. “The regulation system is accountable to the courts. Any misuse of power can be checked.”The new rules that will cover over-the-top (OTT) platforms such as Netflix and Hotstar, social media intermediaries such as Facebook and Twitter, and digital news media, were notified by the government on Thursday. The guidelines mandate a three-tier self-regulation system with an authorised official from the I&B ministry at the apex. The official can check non-compliance with the rules and even issue take-down orders under Section 69A of the Information Technology Act, which so far only applied to social media intermediaries and government agencies.Khare said that the rules represented a paradigm shift in policy. “As of now, any movie that goes to the theatre has to be approved by the certification committee, but for these OTT platforms, no such requirement is there,” he said. “The government has left the decision up to them. They can decide what labels to use. The idea is that the viewer should be aware of what they will be watching.”He stressed that government would in no way alter the content available. “Films only have three categories, while we have provided for five for OTT platforms. The government is willing to consider extending a similar classification for movies released in theatres as well,” Khare said.According to the official, the concept of censorship itself was undergoing a change across the world. “The government does not want to interfere, we just want to ensure that people don’t experience discomfort when it comes to accessing online media,” he said.Khare also highlighted how OTT platforms have democratised entertainment. “These rules were debated for over a year-and-a-half. We have also taken a conscious decision to not set up a web portal where grievances can be filed as we wanted to make sure people didn’t think the government was needlessly interfering,” he said. “The people can directly complain to the platform and if the complaint is not resolved by their standards, it can be escalated to the ministry.”He added that this also provides a safeguard to such OTT platforms as there is an option for civil regulation, and one does not have to tackle FIRs and court cases.OTT platforms such as Amazon Prime have come under fire for airing content that some said “hurt religious sentiments”, with a number of court cases registered. “This provides an alternative remedy that has to be exhausted before they are challenged in court,” Khare said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/new-rules-make-way-for-self-regulation-i-b-ministry-secretary-101614538136749.html

The animal panicked and started running.“Suddenly, the deceased Manohar Lal (21) along with three others went near the elephant trying to take a selfie….The jumbo killed Manohar on the spot while the other three managed to flee,” said Mishra.The kin of the deceased have been given an instant relief amount of ₹25,000 and the body has been sent for post-mortem.Mishra said after the elephant killed the man, it moved southwards leaving behind the 2-year-old calf, which is still in the village.According to forest officials, it was the same female elephant that had attacked and killed an elderly woman in Malda village of the area on Friday.“We are camping in the village since the calf is also waiting. We hope that the elephant will come back at night,” said Mishra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chhattisgarh-man-trampled-to-death-while-trying-to-take-selfie-with-an-elephant-101614537947550.html
