A minister who was part of the cabinet meeting chaired by chief minister Hemant Soren said on condition of anonymity that as of now jobs will be reserved for the locals in the industrial units only. “As of now it[the policy] will be implemented in the industrial units. In due course, other sectors could also follow,” said the minister. The minister, however, refused to share the policy’s blueprint saying it will be made public at an opportune time. People familiar withe the matter said the chief minister is likely to make a formal announcement over the decision in the coming week during the ongoing budget session of Jharkhand assembly. Reserving jobs in the private sector for the state’s local residents was a poll promise for the state’s ruling Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) in the run-up to the 2019 assembly polls. The decision comes days after Haryana implemented its policy reserving 75% jobs in the private sector up to a ₹50, 000 a month salary for local candidates.Opposition BJP said while they welcomed any decision that was for the benefit of the state’s youngsters, they were apprehensive over whether the ruling party would be able to effectively implement the decision. “We have serious doubts that these schemes would help the beneficiaries. It is likely to meet the same fate as the agricultural loan waiver announcement which has hardly benefitted the needy as yet,” said Jharkhand BJP spokesperson Pratul Shahdeo. BJP government in Haryana has recently come up with a similar decision reserving 75% jobs in private sector for the locals. However, the salary cap in the northern state has been kept higher. President of the Federation of Jharkhand Chamber of Commerce & Industries (FJCCI), Praveen Jain Chhabra said in-principle they were not against such a reservation policy but the government should simultaneously help in developing skilled labour force within the state. “We would like the government to push for setting up skill development centres and help the industry in recruiting workforce locally,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jkhand-nod-to-75-quota-for-locals-in-pvt-jobs-101615660183923.html

But this year any scope for students to attend classes is yet to happen. In my opinion with the resurgence of the pandemic in some other states in the country, there is hardly any chance of Classes I-VIII students coming to schools to physically attend classes. So like last year, discussions are underway on what can be done. However, the CM will take a final decision on this,” he said.Students of classes 9 and 11, however have to appear for exams as they are attending offline classes.On March 13 last year, the Odisha government had announced closure of schools and other educational institutions after the World Health Organisation declared the coronavirus outbreak. Later, the school and mass education department postponed the examinations of all the classes starting from Class 1 to 9 and Class 11 as a preventive measure to contain the Covid-19 outbreak.The minister said there is no plan to start the academic session in April due to the heatwave and the academic session will start from June as usual.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-to-promote-all-students-from-classes-1-to-8-for-2nd-consecutive-year-101615659022005.html
13-03-2021||India||2 mn vaccinated in a day, tally reaches 28.2mn: Govt||New Delhi The Union health ministry said on Saturday that India administered record 2.05 million coronavirus vaccine doses a day earlier, taking the total number of shots given so far in the country to 28.2 million.Experts, however, say that the vaccination drive needs to be ramped up quickly to break the chain of transmission of Covid-19 and to control the current surge of infections being reported from certain states. “Although it is heartening to see an increase in pace, it is sort of an under-accomplishment to go at this rate as India has the capacity to cover 7 to 10 million per day,” said Dr Giridhara R Babu, head, epidemiology, Indian Institute of Public Health.India began the Covid-19 vaccination drive, the world’s largest such exercise, on January 16. “India recorded a significant milestone in its countrywide Covid-19 vaccination drive... More than 20 lakh (20,53,537) vaccine doses were given on Day-56 of the vaccination drive (12th March, 2021) through 30,561 sessions. This is the highest single day vaccine administration so far,” said the Union health ministry.Drugs Controller General of India VG Somani has currently approved two vaccines – Covishield and Covaxin – in the fight against Covid-19. Covaxin is co-developed by Bharat Biotech and the Indian council of Medical’s research and the other vaccine is developed by Oxford-AstraZeneca and is locally manufactured by the Serum Institute of India.First doses have been administered to 1,639,663 health care and frontline workers, and 413,874 health care and frontline workers have received the second dose of vaccines so far, according to government data.Since the vaccination was opened in the second phase on on March 1, 7,291,716 individuals above 60 years of age and 1,254,468 between 45 and 59 years with specified comorbidities have been vaccinated in the country. Eight states constituted 74% of the 2,053,537 doses administered in last 24 hours, the Union health ministry said. Uttar Pradesh topped the list with at least 330,000 vaccine doses.“Covering 10 million people a day will ensure that we will cover the entire vulnerable population within a month. This will prevent any sort of second wave in India. Given the proactive and strong leadership shown by India so far in tackling Covid-19, the ambitious goal to cover them within 30 days will take us ahead of the virus. This ambition is a necessity, not for any records,” Dr Babu said.India’s caseload stood at 202,022 on Saturday, according to government data. The current caseload is 1.78% of the total positive cases. Maharashtra, Kerala, Punjab, Karnataka, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu and Madhya Pradesh reported 87.72% of the new cases in the last 24 hours. Maharashtra accounts for 63.57% of India’s total active cases.“Central teams have been rushed to various states that are reporting a surge in cases, and states have been advised to revert to the earlier strategy of test, trace, and treat to curb the chain of transmission. But most important is for people to understand that we must observe Covid-19-appropriate behaviour. It is imperative to wear a mask, observe physical distancing and maintain hygiene as there is still a large section of the population that is susceptible,” said Dr Vinod Paul, member (health), Niti Aayog.The Union health ministry’s national Covid-19 task force will meet next week to review adverse events following immunisation to check for any reported cases of blood clots or similar side effects in individuals post-vaccination. The ministry held a preliminary meeting with state nodal officers on Saturday for the second consecutive day to collect adverse events data from across the country.“This raw data will be presented to the national adverse committee for close scrutiny,” said a senior government official directly involved with Covid-19 management.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2-mn-vaccinated-in-a-day-tally-reaches-28-2mn-govt-101615659826758.html
13-03-2021||India||Ambani threat case: NIA records statement of Mumbai cop Sachin Vaze||New Delhi A special cell team of Delhi police on Saturday interrogated Tehsin Akhtar, the last known chief of the now dormant homegrown terror outfit Indian Mujahideen (IM), after two smartphones were recovered from his barrack in Tihar’s jail number 8, one of which reportedly sent out a message that claimed responsibility for the explosives found in the SUV outside Mukesh Ambani’s residence on February 25.The police on Friday sought a city court’s permission to question Akhtar – a 30-year-old civil engineer from Darbangha, Bihar, and a known close associate of arrested IM co-founder Yasin Bhatkal – who is known to authorities as being both tech-savvy and an expert in making bombs.“Special cell officers are interrogating Tehsin Akhtar. We had handed them the phones on Thursday [March 11] night. They came in the afternoon [of March 13] and are still inside,” a prison officer who spoke on the condition of anonymity said late Saturday night.A Telegram channel was created by “jaishulhind” [Jaish-ul-Hind] on February 26 and a message claiming responsibility for parking the vehicle outside Antilia, where Ambani lives with his family, was posted from that channel. A message seeking payment in bitcoin, a cryptocurrency, was also sent out on this channel, which reportedly had 10 members. The identity of the members is not immediately known as the maker of the channel closed the group the following day. The National Investigation Authority (NIA) is investigating the explosives found outside Ambani’s house after the Union home ministry took suo motu notice of the case.During the course of its investigation, the agency discovered the Telegram message and traced it to Tihar jail. The Delhi police’s special cell was informed that two phones – an Oppo and a Vivo; both smartphones – were active inside the prison. At 8pm on March 11, Tihar prison authorities conducted a raid inside jail number 8 and found both phones. Police are investigating whether Akhtar was involved in making the Telegram channel, as he is not the only one lodged inside the high risk cell of jail number 8. A second police officer said that Akhtar shares the cell with at least four other prisoners who have also been arrested on terror charges. The four men were arrested for being operatives of IM and Al Qaeda’s Indian sub-continent module.Akhtar was the “operational chief” of IM when he was arrested in 2014 from Naxalbari in West Bengal, police said. He is reported to be in touch with other IM co-founders, Riyaz and Iqbal Bhatkal, who are believed to be hiding in Pakistan. He is implicated in a number of blasts, including one that took place during Narendra Modi’s rally in 2013 in Patna, as well as the 2011 Mumbai blasts at Zaveri Bazari and Opera House. While most of the leaders behind IM are either convicted or behind bars, little is known about Jaish-ul-Hind. “[Akhtar] seems to have a role in recovery of mobile phones from Tihar but one thing is for sure that there is no terror outfit named Jaish-ul-Hind on the ground. It’s most likely that somebody has played mischief or old Indian Mujahideen (IM) members are trying to be in limelight by claiming to be somebody else. We are investigating Tehsin Akhtar and other angles. We do not want to rule out anything yet,” said a Delhi Police officer, requesting anonymity. A top counter-terrorism expert who spoke on the condition of anonymity said the so-called Jaish-ul-Hind had made similar claim after the low intensity explosion outside the Israel embassy on January 29, but the Internet Protocol address used for that message was traced to Turkey. The NIA too is looking into the role of Tehsin Akhtar, also known as Monu, because of his capability as a master-strategist, officials said. Akhtar had become the prime motivator and ideologue with the capacity to develop new modules for the now-banned outfit. He had also emerged as the vital link between the IM and other radical extremist groups emerging out of the umbrella of banned Students Islamic Movement of India (SIMI) after the arrest of Yasin Bhatkal in 2013.Mumbai cop questioned by NIAThe NIA on Saturday recorded the statement of Mumbai Police Assistant Police Inspector Sachin Vaze in relation to its probe.Vaze, an assistant police inspector with the Crime Intelligence Unit of the Mumbai crime branch till last week, was the lead investigator in the explosives case before it was transferred to the Anti Terrorism Squad, and later the NIA.Vaze’s statement was recorded to understand the sequence of events as he was initially heading the investigation in Scorpio case as well his connection with Mansukh Hiran who was linked to the vehicle.“We are talking to several Mumbai police officers including all the Investigating Officers (IOs) who handled the probe initially. It’s part of the process,” a senior NIA officer said.Vaze is also under the scanner of the ATS for his involvement in the suspicious death of Mansukh Hiran, a 48-year-old Thane-based businessman linked to the Scorpio carrying explosives found parked outside Ambani’s house.He was transferred out of the crime branch last week after leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis demanded his arrest in connection with Hiran’s death, after Hiran’s wife Vimla told the ATS that she suspected Vaze had a hand in her husband’s death.Vaze, who filed for anticipatory bail on Friday, was denied interim protection by the Thane District and Sessions Court on Saturday which stated that “custodial interrogation is necessary” was necessary in the investigation.The court posted the anticipatory bail hearing to March 19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ambani-threat-case-nia-records-statement-of-mumbai-cop-sachin-vaze-101615659823908.html
13-03-2021||India||'Test for govt job recruitment likely to be held in Sept': Union minister||Union Minister Jitendra Singh on Saturday said the Common Eligibility Test (CET) for government jobs recruitment is likely to be held around September this year.He said the National Recruitment Agency (NRA) for conducting the CET has been constituted with the approval of the Union Cabinet.“As a major boon for the youth, particularly the government job aspirants, a Common Eligibility Test (CET) will be conducted across the country from this year to screen and shortlist candidates for recruitment to central government jobs,” said Singh, the Minister of State for Personnel.The first such test is likely to be held in the later part of 2021, probably around September or so, he told PTI here.Singh said the "path-breaking transformational reform" carried out by the Department of Personnel & Training (DoPT) was possible because of the personal intervention of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his deep concern for the youth.The NRA, he said, will be a multi-agency body which will conduct the common test to screen and shortlist candidates for Group B and C (non-technical) posts.The most significant feature of this reform is that every district in the country will have at least one examination centre which would greatly enhance access to the candidates living in far-flung areas, the minister said.One of the important objectives of this historic reform, said Singh, is to provide a level playing field to every candidate so that none of the job aspirant is at a disadvantage and has an equal opportunity, regardless of his or her background or socio-economic status.This will also be beneficial for women and Divyang candidates as well as those who find it financially unaffordable to appear for multiple tests by travelling to different centres, he said.Singh also pointed out that the NRA will be an independent, autonomous organisation responsible for shortlisting candidates for certain categories for which recruitment is carried through Staff Selection Commission (SSC), Railway Recruitment Boards (RRBs) and Institute of Banking Personnel Selection (IBPS).However, the existing central recruiting agencies like SSC, RRBs and IBPS would continue to conduct specific recruitment as per their requirements and the CET will only be the test for preliminary screening of candidates for the jobs, he clarified.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/test-for-govt-job-recruitment-likely-to-be-held-in-sept-union-minister-101615658744683.html

Maharashtra, Delhi, Kerala, Punjab, Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka have been warned by the Centre as they have recently recorded a rise in the number of Covid-19 cases. These states and Union Territories are also contributing maximum to the rise in daily caseload recorded across the country.Vardhan inaugurated various facilities at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) at Bhopal and said that the government is aiming to expand the number of medical institutes across the nation so that citizens can avail high-quality health care.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cant-afford-defeat-in-war-against-covid-19-vardhan-warns-citizens-101615658276608.html

In its clarification, issued through the fact check division of the Press Information Bureau, it said that the claims are false. It was only a suggestion given to the Railway Board. The ministry has not taken any decision in this regard.कुछ मीडिया रिपोर्ट्स में दावा किया जा रहा है कि जो यात्री ट्रेन में नींद लेकर सफर करना चाहें, रेलवे उनसे 10% अधिक किराया वसूल सकता है।#PIBFactCheck: यह दावा #भ्रामक है। यह केवल #Railwayboard को दिया गया एक सुझाव था। @RailMinIndia ने ऐसी कोई घोषणा नहीं की है। pic.twitter.com/M4UFasUo6VSince March 22, 2020, the railways stopped regular train services owing to the Covid-19 outbreak. In a staggered manner since then, it has been resuming operations but regular services still remain suspended. According to a statement issued by the railways ministry in February, the railways has operationalised almost 65 per cent of the mail/express trains and over 90 per cent of suburban services as compared to the pre-lockdown numbers.As the services that have been resumed after the national lockdown are all special services, there have been changes in the fare structure. Slightly higher fares have been introduced at small distance trains to discourage passengers from travelling amid the pandemic. "Covid is still around and in fact worsening in some States. Visitors from many States are being subjected to screening in other areas and discouraged to travel. A little higher price is be seen as Proactive measure of Railways to prevent crowding in trains and stop Covid from spreading," railways said in February."Railways has taken special care about those travelling by lowest fare in trains so that even in Covid times they bear the least burden. In all the trains that are being run, besides other classes, the trains have a large number of 2S class coaches which have the lowest fare in the reserved category," it said earlier.With a similar aim to prevent crowding at platforms, the railways has increased the platform ticket prices from ₹10 to ₹30. But this is a temporary measure, the ministry said.However, a 10 per cent increase in fares of night travellers was only a suggestion and no decision has been taken on it, it has said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-refutes-reports-of-train-fare-hike-for-night-passengers-says-it-was-only-a-suggestion-101615654763529.html

13-03-2021||India||200 terrorists active inside J&K, 250 waiting in launch pads across LoC: DGP||Around 200 terrorists are active in Jammu and Kashmir while intelligence inputs suggest that another 250 are waiting in launch pads across the border, Director General of Jammu and Kashmir Police Dilbag Singh said on Saturday.In a clear reference to Pakistan, Singh said security forces are alive to the threat and on alert to scuttle the nefarious designs of the neighbouring country to disturb peace in the union territory.The DGP also said all necessary security arrangements would be made to ensure that the Amarnath Yatra in south Kashmir Himalayas, scheduled to commence on June 28, is peaceful.Talking to reporters before inaugurating the inter zone sports meet at the police headquarters here, Singh said there are around 200 terrorists active in Jammu and Kashmir.“I am hopeful that the number will drop further this year like the previous year when the figure dropped to a large extent,” he said.On the number of terrorists present in launching pads across the Line of Control (LoC) and International Border (IB), the police chief said as per intelligence inputs, the number is between 200 to 250 which is almost the same as previous years.“We are keeping an eye on them as well,” he said.Responding to a question about the preparations for the Amarnath Yatra, he said, “All arrangements with regard to the pilgrimage will be done like previous years including large scale deployment (of security personnel) at different levels.”“This year too, our efforts are on and every necessary arrangement will be put in place for the safety and security of the pilgrims,” he added.Without naming Pakistan, he said the agencies of the neighbouring country are involved in terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir for the last over 30 years to disturb peace and harm the lives and property of the people.“We have been foiling their nefarious designs for a long time and will continue to do so,” he said when asked about the recovery of ₹91 lakh by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) from a field in Samba district following a disclosure by one of the five people arrested in connection with Handwara narco-terrorism case.The DGP said police has unearthed a number of narco-terrorism cases in 2020 and 2021 and every one of them is being investigated to unveil the conspiracy and bring the culprits to book.“Some of the cases which had a widened scale of nexus between terrorists and narco traders were transferred to the NIA. They too are probing these cases with full capability,” he said.Singh said besides narcotics, weapons including ready-to-use Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs), smuggled from across the border, are being seized before they could land in the hands of terrorists and used against civilians and security forces.“A few incidents do take place here and there but after investigation the accused are being identified and stern action is being taken against them,” he said, assuring appropriate action against terrorists involved in the grenade attack in Sopore which left two policemen injured.The police chief said a befitting response was given to every terror act.Asked about the recent recovery of sticky bombs, he said such types of explosives are a threat because they have magnets and can be stuck on any metallic surface.“This is a conspiracy to target civilian and security forces vehicles. We have seized such bombs and if some of these have managed to reach terrorists, we will recover them too,” he said while referring to the recovery of a 7 kg IED in Jammu on February 14 and busting of a terror module in Awantipora area of south Kashmir which was planning to carry out a Pulwama-type attack.“The fidayeen (suicide bomber) was prepared to blow himself but timely action prevented the attack…I want to assure that any activity, whether going on the ground or underground, is being watched and neutralised. We are having a strict watch on them,” the police chief said.On the Inter zone sports meet-2021, the DGP said all six zones of the force are taking part in the tournament.“About 1000 police personnel, covering all wings of police, are taking part in 30 sports activities during the tournament.

She had sought bail on the grounds that she was pregnant and had severe medical complications.She was arrested in April 2020 for allegedly conspiring with others to instigate and start the violence in northeast Delhi. At least 53 people died and 400 others were injured in the violence in February 2020. Zargar said she was only part of protests and denied the allegations made by police.In its report, WGAD concluded that Zargar “was deprived of her liberty on discriminatory grounds, owing to her status as a human rights defender, and on the basis of her political or other opinion regarding the Citizenship (Amendment) Act”. WGAD urged the government to “ensure a full and independent investigation of the circumstances surrounding the arbitrary deprivation of liberty” of Zargar and to take “appropriate measures against those responsible for the violation of her rights”.WGAD further said it considers that Zargar was “targeted for discrimination on the basis of her status as a human rights defender and in violation of her right to equality before the law and equal protection of the law under article 26 of the Covenant”. The group also considers that Zargar’s “political views and beliefs regarding the Government’s policies and actions are at the heart of the present case”.The group also referred Zargar’s case to the UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders, the Special Rapporteur on promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, and the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism, for appropriate action.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/detention-arbitrary-eligible-for-compensation-says-un-panel-on-safoora-zargar-101615650950870.html

The district and state level initial investigations have found no causal relationship vaccine and these events,” Arora, an advisor to the national AEFI committee, told PTI."The national AEFI is reviewing these cases again for a final causality assessment," he said."No specific vaccine is being looked at. We are carrying out a detailed evaluation of all the serious adverse events including deaths and hospitalisations following vaccination to determine the causality aspect for the both vaccines-- Covishield and Covaxin. If any cause of concern emerges, it will be conveyed," Dr Arora said.The WHO had on Friday said there was no reason to stop using the vaccine as several countries suspended the use amid concerns of blood clotting. The WHO’s global advisory committee on vaccine safety is presently reviewing the reports.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amid-concerns-over-covishield-india-studies-post-vaccination-adverse-events-101615649986605.html

Talking about her arrest, trial and judicial custody, Ravi said that even when she was produced before the court, she was unaware if she would get any legal assistance.“As I stood in that courtroom, desperately searching for my lawyers, I came to terms with the fact that I would have to defend myself. I had no idea whether there was legal assistance available so when the judge asked me if I have anything to say, I decided to speak my mind. Before I knew it, I was sent to 5 days in police custody,” she wrote in a statement published on her social media accounts on Saturday evening.She further added that in the entire ordeal her autonomy was violated. “My autonomy was violated; my photographs were splashed all over the news; my actions were pronounced guilty - not in the court of law, but on flat screens by seekers of TRPs. I sat there, unaware of the many abstractions made of me in order to satiate their idea of me,” she wrote.In jail, she realised how talking about climate change had become a crime but also learnt that her grandparents, who were farmers, birthed climate activist in her. "At the end of the five days I was shifted to Judicial Custody for 3 days, I wondered when it became a crime to think the most basic elements of sustenance on this planet were as much mine as theirs," she wrote.Also read: ‘Going to Nandigram…’ -BKU’s Rakesh Tikait says ‘BJP has robbed the country'Before ending her statement, she made case for those who didn’t get the support she received. “The immense outpour of love from the people gave me strength. I am grateful for everyone who stood by me. The past few days have been beyond painful, yet I know that I am one of the privileged. I was lucky enough to have excellent pro bono legal assistance but what of all those who do not?” read her statement.On February 23, a Delhi court had granted bail to Ravi, days after the Delhi Police arrested her for allegedly editing a social media document, or a toolkit, about the ongoing farmer protest against the three central laws.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/my-autonomy-was-violated-disha-ravi-s-statement-after-28-days-of-arrest-101615649612291.html

We should continue to follow the stipulated guidelines to prevent the spread of the virus. Please avoid large gatherings and continue vaccinating priority groups so as to prevent the outbreak of new wave of infections,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-cases-cross-200-in-telangana-after-a-gap-of-50-days-borders-on-alert-101615649217618.html

Monday happened to be International Women's Day and on the occasion, women MLAs from across parties had presided over the day's proceedings in the Haryana Assembly.Hooda along with some party legislators sat on the tractor while some other Congress MLAs pulled the tractor with ropes.Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar had expressed his anguish over the incident and said in the Assembly, "This treatment to women MLAs was worse than bonded labour."As known to the whole world, the day is celebrated as International Women's Day and the instance shocked the entire nation, Bhardwaj wrote in the letter.Seeking a “strict written explanation” from Hooda within three days (by Sunday), Bhardwaj wrote why strict penal action under relevant provisions of law may not be taken against him.In the communication, she wrote, "What is important to understand here is the fact that this act was committed with the ulterior motive and intention to harm, disrespect and strip the dignity of women on Women's Day itself.""You have committed an act of gendered political violence with the motive to watershed the relevance of all events planned for March 8 Women's Day. Sadly, you chose women to commit this undignified and disrespectful act that has hanged the heads of one and all, irrespective of gender or party or any affiliations, in shame…You chose to challenge our existence—as women,” she wrote.Bhardwaj alleged that Hooda chose to challenge women MLAs of Haryana “by attempting to strip them of their joy and pride as presiding officers" in the Haryana Assembly.You chose to challenge the head of the government–chief minister of Haryana--who was overwhelmed while making a point regarding in context of this incident next day before whole strength of the Legislative Assembly, she said.She further added, “You chose to challenge and you managed to play with the emotional connect that each person has with women in their lives – as grandmother, as mother, as daughter, as wife, as niece, as colleague, as party worker, as neighbour and a Goddess, too.”One of the MLAs who had pulled the tractor , Shakuntala Khatak, had on Thursday asserted that she never considered herself less than men and accused the BJP of "playing dirty politics" over the matter."This is our internal matter. When I am not complaining, why do they have a problem? He (Hooda) is my leader, he is like my father. If I have to push a truck, I will do that too," Khatak had told reporters here.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fuel-prices-protest-women-panel-seeks-explanation-from-congress-hooda-on-tractor-episode-101615648232008.html

But there are 1.19 lakh doctors in the state at present."Earlier the leader of opposition Tejashwi Yadav during the debate on the Health Department's budget raised the issue of WHO norms for providing health services in the state.As per WHO norms, there should be one doctor for every 1,000 people.The minister, who was giving a reply to the House debate on the budgetary demand of ₹13,264.86 crore of his department for 2021-22 fiscal, also gave the break-up vis-- vis the number of doctors registered in the state in different streams.There are 40,200 allopathic doctors, 33,922 ayush doctors, 34,257 homeopathic doctors, 5,203 unani doctors and 6,130 dentists, he said.He said there is a shortage of 1,000 doctors in the state if one follows WHO norms, adding that the government is taking steps and measures to improve health services and facilities by opening 11 new medical colleges, 23 general nursing and midwifery (GNM) schools, 54 nursing schools at sub-divisional level besides appointing doctors in the state.Of the 11 new medical colleges, the work on seven colleges is currently underway, he said and added that Patna Medical College and Hospital is being redeveloped to make it the country's first and the world's second largest hospital at a cost of ₹5,540.07 crore.

If not, I will fight it legally. I have a mother with co-morbid conditions, my father died 15 years back, I am the only breadwinner for my family.

13-03-2021||India||Fliers without masks, not heeding Covid-19 protocols could be deboarded: Centre||The government on Saturday directed airport authorities and airlines to take strict action against those not complying with Covid-19 protocols at airports and inside planes.Those found flouting rules may be offloaded and handed over to security agencies, the Director General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) said.“The Airport Director/Terminal Manager, as applicable, must ensure that passengers are wearing masks properly and do maintain social distance at all times within the Airport premises. In case, any passenger is not following “COVID-19 Protocol”, they should be handed over to security agencies after proper warnings. If required, they may be dealt as per law,” the DGCA said in an order issued on Saturday.“On board the Aircraft, in case any passenger does not adhere to wearing of mask properly even after repeated warnings, he/she should be de-boarded, if need be, before departure. In case, any passenger on board an aircraft refuses to wear mask or violates the “COVID-19 Protocol for passengers” even after repeated warnings, during the course of the flight, such passenger may be treated as “Unruly Passenger” as defined in para 3.1 of Civil Aviation Requirements (CAR) Section 3 Series M Part VI (dated 8th September, 2017) and the procedure in respect of handling such unruly passenger, as provided in above mentioned CAR, shall be followed by the concerned airline,” it added.This came days after the Delhi high court issued a set of guidelines that empower airline crew to offload any passenger not wearing their mask properly and to be put on the no-fly list if they exhibit “stubborn reluctance”. The judge had taken note of the callous attitude of passengers at airports and passed directions to the DGCA.At present, India has allowed domestic flights to function at 80% of their capacity while international flights are being operated through travel bubble arrangements with 27 countries. “Transport Bubbles” or “Air Bridges” are temporary arrangements between two countries aimed at restarting commercial passenger services when regular international flights are suspended as a result of the pandemic. They are reciprocal in nature, meaning airlines from both countries enjoy similar benefits.“It has been noticed that some travellers undertaking air journey do not adhere to “COVID-19 Protocols”, which essentially involves wearing of mask properly i.e. not below the nose, during all times of the journey from entering the Airport for departure to exiting the Airport after arrival. It has also been noted that some passengers after entering the Airport do not wear mask properly and also do not maintain social distance while being in the airport premises. Similarly, some passengers have been noticed not wearing their masks properly while on-board the aircraft,” the DGCA said.“Passengers shall wear masks and maintain social distancing norms at all times during air travel. The mask shall not be moved below the nose except under exceptional circumstances. CISF or other Police personnel deployed at the entrance of the Airport shall ensure that no one is allowed to enter the Airport without wearing a mask. CASO and other supervising officers must ensure this personally. The adherence to above directions shall be ensured by all concerned with immediate effect. Strict action shall be taken in case of any violation,” it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fliers-without-masks-not-heeding-covid-19-protocols-could-be-deboarded-centre-101615644756312.html

A few Maharashtra leaders have been demanding the merger of the regions dominated by Marathi-speaking people in Karnataka, especially Belagavi, which the pro-Kannada organisations have been opposing. According to a senior officer in the North West Karnataka Road Transport Corporation, a vehicle belonging to Maharashtra was blackened in Belagavi which aggravated the tension between the regions. "The Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation officials had asked us if there was tension in Kolhapur and asked us not to run any buses. They too did not run any bus," the officer added. Meanwhile in Mumbai, Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut alleged that Marathi people residing in Karnataka's Belgaum were being victimised, and said an all-party delegation from Maharashtra should visit the city in the neighbouring state to resolve the ongoing stand-off. He told reporters that in the last eight days there have been instances of attack on Shiv Sena leaders and the party's office in Belgaum by pro-Kannada outfits. "Belgaum is part of India and the Maharashtra- Karnataka dispute is a language dispute. It shouldn't be stretched too far and this is the responsibility of the Karnataka government too," he said. Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray had been raising the issue of merger of Belagavi and other Marathi- dominated regions with Maharashtra time and again.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-temporarily-stops-bus-service-to-maharashtra-over-border-row-101615644008304.html

No one is talking about the attack on Marathi people for the last eight days. I appeal to the Chief Minister, Deputy CM to go to Belgaum with an all-party delegation to support our people," said Raut."The Maharashtra and Karnataka dispute is a language dispute. It shouldn't be stretched too far," he added.His remarks came a day after Karnataka Rakshana Vedike activists in Belgaum also known as Belgavi, had blackened and removed signages and hoardings written in Marathi language.The border dispute between Maharashtra and Karnataka began after the States Reorganization Act of 1956 made Belgaum and 10 talukas of Bombay State (formerly part of erstwhile Bombay Presidency) a part of then Mysore state.The issue of the disputed border area has been pending in the Supreme Court for several years.Belagavi, Karwar, and Nipani are part of Karnataka and have Marathi-speaking people. Right from the beginning, Maharashtra has asserted its claim over these districts while the Karnataka government has opposed the assertion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sanjay-raut-calls-for-all-party-visit-to-belgaum-after-attack-on-marathi-people-101615642366092.html

This will also add an estimated 10,000 chargers in Delhi by December, the minister said."Also, we are in advance talks with several EV fleet operators to open up their captive charging stations for public use. This will add another 750 charging points at least for public use in Delhi by June," Gahlot said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/decision-to-install-charging-point-at-every-3-km-paving-way-for-delhi-as-ev-capital-transport-minister-gahlot-101615641677148.html

On Saturday, Aurangabad district administration decided to impose weekend lockdowns until further orders. From March 15, a strict lockdown will be there in Nagpur. However, people are still crowding especially before a place is scheduled to go under lockdown, as people are flocking to markets to hoard essentials, though essential services will be allowed during lockdown.In Munbai city, apartments and highrises are the hotspots, while slums have reported comparatively fewer number of infections in the last two months. In districts, general disobeyance to social distancing rules, reopening of establishments, pandemic fatigue have been identified as factors contributing to the rise.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/with-1-709-cases-in-24-hours-mumbai-sees-highest-covid-19-surge-this-year-101615642603539.html

Vaze had applied for anticipatory bail in the Thane court although he didn't appear for the hearing. The court has given March 19 as the next date of hearing.A lawyer from the Thane court said, “The interim application was initially rejected by the sessions court on Friday after arguments of both parties. On the next date the investigation officer will have to provide further details in the case to support the argument. Later, the applicant can approach the high court if his application gets rejected here.”Vaze’s lawyer and the Public prosecutor refused to speak on the matter.API Sachin Vaze's name cropped up in connection with the death of Mansukh Hiran, an auto parts dealer linked to the SUV found parked outside billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s residence on February 25, with 20 sticks of gelatin and a threatening letter.On February 25, an SUV with loose sticks of gelatin was found parked outside Mukesh Ambani’s house. It was traced to an auto parts businessman based in Thane, but on March 5, his body washed up ashore in a creek on the outskirts of Mumbai.The deceased’s widow Vimla Hiran mentioned in her statement given to the police that she had doubts regarding Sachin Vaze’s role in the matter. Vimla told the investigators that the vehicle belonged to a certain Dr Peter Newton who was known to her deceased husband.

13-03-2021||India||Centre should uphold Places of Worship Act: CPI-M||The CPI(M) on Saturday questioned the need to examine the validity of the Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act, saying the Centre should uphold the provisions of the legislation in its response to the Supreme Court.The remarks came a day after the top court sought the Centre's response to a plea against certain provisions of the 1991 law, which prohibits the filing of a lawsuit to reclaim a place of worship or seek a change in its character from what prevailed on August 15, 1947.The PIL assumes significance amid demands by some Hindu groups to reclaim religious places at Mathura and Kashi."It is unfortunate that the Supreme Court has opened the way for a re-examination of the Places of Worship (Special Provision) Act, 1991," the Left party said in a statement.The Act mandates that the character of all religious places of worship should be maintained as it was on August 15, 1947, and no suit or proceedings shall lie in a court of law with respect to the character of places of worship, the CPI(M) said."This effectively barred courts from entertaining cases which raise disputes over places of worship that existed as of August 15, 1947," it said. "The law further provided that such cases already pending in courts would stand abated."The petition alleges that the 1991-law creates an "arbitrary and irrational retrospective cut-off date" of August 15, 1947, for maintaining the character of the places of worship or pilgrimage against encroachment done by "fundamentalist-barbaric invaders and law-breakers".The CPI(M) said the Act granted an exception for the Babri Masjid/Ramjanmabhoomi site in Ayodhya, which was then under dispute.While invoking this exemption, the Supreme Court, in the 2019 Ayodhya verdict, reaffirmed that similar such cases cannot be entertained with respect to other sites in view of this Act.The CPI(M) politburo reaffirms that the grounds on which this law was enacted "need not be re-examined," it said. "The Central Government must respond to the Supreme Court seeking its views in a firm affirmation of the Places of Worship Act, 1991."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-should-uphold-places-of-worship-act-cpim-101615639935863.html
13-03-2021||India||India's draft e-commerce policy calls for equal treatment of sellers||India will require e-commerce firms to treat sellers equally on their platforms and ensure transparency, according to a draft policy seen by Reuters on Saturday that follows criticism against business practices of big online companies.India has been deliberating a new e-commerce policy for months amid complaints from brick-and-mortar retailers who allege online giants like Amazon and Walmart's Flipkart flout federal regulations. The companies have denied the allegations.A Reuters special report last month revealed that Amazon has for years given preferential treatment to a small group of sellers on its India platform and used them to circumvent the country's foreign investment rules.The latest draft of the policy document says operators should be impartial in their dealings with sellers."E-commerce operators must ensure equal treatment of all sellers/vendors registered on their platforms and not adopt algorithms which result in prioritizing select vendors/sellers," it says.A spokesman for the commerce ministry declined to comment.The policy will apply to Amazon and Flipkart - two top e-commerce players in India - as well as domestic players like Reliance Industries, which has plans to expand its JioMart online platform. All three firms did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Separately, India is also considering changes to foreign investment rules that could prompt players including Amazon to restructure their ties with some major sellers, Reuters reported in January.Government officials are set to hold talks next week with industry executives on such rules, according to people with direct knowledge.On Saturday, top government officials from various departments, including the commerce ministry, met to discuss the e-commerce policy. The timeline of publication and whether it will be subject to further changes were not immediately clear.Indian traders have also complained about steep discounts offered by online companies which smaller retailers have not been able to match. Amazon and Flipkart have said they comply with all laws.E-commerce firms must "bring out clear and transparent policies" on online discounts, the draft document says.The Reuters special report last month - based on internal Amazon documents dated between 2012 and 2019 - showed the company helped a small number of sellers prosper on its India platform, giving them discounted fees and helping one cut special deals with big tech manufacturers.Amazon has said it "does not give preferential treatment to any seller on its marketplace," and that it "treats all sellers in a fair, transparent, and non-discriminatory manner."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indias-draft-e-commerce-policy-calls-for-equal-treatment-of-sellers-101615638753191.html
13-03-2021||India||Air quality commission shuts down after ordinance lapses||The central government's Commission for Air Quality Management in the National Capital Region and adjoining areas has been shut down within five months of its constitution after the ordinance issued to constitute it lapsed.Ordinances must be approved by Parliament within six weeks of the Parliament convening or they cease to operate. They will also cease to operate in case resolutions disapproving the Ordinance are passed by both the Houses.Environment secretary RP Gupta said in a statement on Saturday, “Since the ordinance was not introduced in Parliament within six weeks of its convention, it has lapsed and consequently, the commission also stands shut. The ordinance never became an Act. Any ordinance has to be introduced within six weeks of the convening of Parliament. It did not happen, so the ordinance has lapsed and hence, the commission is dissolved.”The Union environment ministry had published, “The Commission for Air Quality Management in National Capital Region and Adjoining Area Ordinance” on October 28, to implement a consolidated approach to monitoring, tackling and eliminating causes of air pollution in Delhi NCR and adjoining areas.Also read: Permanent shelters come up at Delhi border as farm leaders warn they won’t budgeWhile doing so, it dissolved all ad-hoc committees and bodies created under court orders including the SC mandated environment pollution control authority (EPCA) which had been tasked with overseeing air pollution control in NCR since 1998. It had also brought in a completely new, centralised regime of pollution control where an appeal against any order or direction of the Commission can be made only in the National Green Tribunal. No civil court will have the jurisdiction to entertain any suit or proceedings against the decisions of the Commission.The Commission was a statutory authority that could coordinate air pollution control with the governments of Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Delhi and Uttar Pradesh and was to have 18 fulltime members appointed by the Central government with a wide range of powers to issue directions, entertain complaints; regulate and prohibit activities that are likely to cause or increase air pollution, lay down parameters and standards, restrict industry, activities, processes, direct closure or prohibit any polluting activity in Delhi NCR and adjoining areas.Legal and environmental experts said shutting down of the Commission shows the Centre was not serious about tackling air pollution in NCR.“An ordinance is always a stop-gap arrangement till the Parliament convenes. Even the forest conservation act was brought in through an ordinance and then passed in the Parliament. During last winter when stubble burning had peaked, the Centre seemed to have rushed to issue the ordinance but they were definitely not serious about air pollution or functions of the ordinance. The ordinance has to be presented in the form of a bill and then it becomes an act when it is passed in Parliament or the ordinance lapses after six weeks. No bill was presented. The government can issue a fresh ordinance if they want the Commission to function. The Commission did not have an office, they did not respond to complaints. I doubt how serious the government was about the Commission,” said Ritwick Dutta, an environmental lawyer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/air-quality-commission-shuts-down-after-ordinance-lapses-101615638859023.html
13-03-2021||India||State election commissioners have to be independent persons: Supreme Court||State election commissioners have to be "independent persons" not occupying a post under the Centre or state governments, the Supreme Court has ruled, terming the Goa government's move to give its law secretary the additional charge of the SEC a "mockery" of constitutional mandate.In a significant verdict, the top court also directed if there were any such persons holding the post of SEC in any other state, "such persons must be asked forthwith to step down from such office and the State Government concerned be bound to fulfil the constitutional mandate of Article 243K by appointing only independent persons to this high constitutional office".A three-judge bench, headed by Justice R F Nariman, issued the direction to all states and Union territories while taking recourse of its extraordinary powers under Article 142 of the Constitution that empowers it to pass any order in the interest of justice.The directions were issued to ensure that the constitutional mandate of an independent State Election Commission to conduct elections is "strictly followed in the future", said the bench, also comprising Justices B R Gavai and Hrishikesh Roy.The observations and directions were given in the 96-page judgement, penned by Justice Nariman, on a batch of pleas relating to the urban local body polls in Goa.The judgment, uploaded on the apex court's website on Saturday, has upheld the Bombay High Court's verdict of setting aside an order of the municipal administrator on February 4 on granting quota to women and OBC candidates in local urban body polls in five municipal councils in the state.The bench directed the Goa SEC to issue the notification for the urban body polls within 10 days from Friday and complete the poll process by April 30.Justice Nariman extensively dealt with the constitutional scheme pertaining to elections and the SECs."It is also made clear that henceforth, all State Election Commissioners appointed under Article 243K in the length and breadth of India have to be independent persons who cannot be persons who are occupying a post or office under the Central or any State Government," it held."The most disturbing feature of these cases is the subversion of the constitutional mandate contained in Article 243K of the Constitution of India."The State Election Commissioner has to be a person who is independent of the State Government as he is an important constitutional functionary who is to oversee the entire election process in the state qua panchayats and municipalities," Justice Nariman, who wrote the judgement for the bench, said.The importance given to the independence of a SEC is explicit from the provision for his removal from his office which equal to a judge of the high court."Giving an additional charge of such an important and independent constitutional office to an officer who is directly under the control of the State Government is, in our view, a mockery of the constitutional mandate," the verdict said.It declared that the additional charge given to a law secretary flouted the constitutional mandate and asked the Goa government to "remedy this position by appointing an independent person to be the State Election Commissioner at the earliest".Petitions were filed in the Bombay High Court relating to the elections to 11 municipal councils where terms had expired on November 4 last year and the SEC had fixed polls in April, 2021.The law secretary, who was given additional charge of the SEC on November 3, had postponed the polls due to the pandemic.Pleas were filed in the high court against a change in the Goa Municipalities Act, by which the time frame for issuance of a notification for reservation of wards was stated as being "at least seven days" before the notification for schedule of dates and events of the elections.The high court set aside the "impugned order issued by the Director and ex-officio Additional Secretary, Municipal Administrator/ Urban Development, Goa".The court had also directed the Goa municipal administrator to issue fresh notification for polls after ensuring "reservation for women of not less than one-third of the total number of seats reserved for direct elections to the Municipal Councils".The top court upheld the high court's judgement and said under the Constitution, "no election to any municipality can be called in question except by an election petition presented to a Tribunal as is provided by or under any law made by the Legislature of a State".This would mean that from the date of notification of the election till the date of the declaration of result, a judicial hands-off is mandated by the non-obstante clause "debarring the writ court under Articles 226 and 227 from interfering once the election process has begun until it is over".The constitutional bar operates only during this period. It is therefore a matter of discretion exercisable by a writ court as to whether an interference is called for when the notification for elections is yet to be announced, the court added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/state-election-commissioners-have-to-be-independent-persons-supreme-court-101615636826691.html

This is the key to India’s future. Economies of both east and southeast Asia have transformed themselves within one generation, said Amitabh Kant, chief executive officer (CEO), NITI Aayog.Kant was delivering a keynote address at the inaugural event of the Militaria 2021 held at Hotel Narain Niwas Palace in Jaipur on Saturday.“India has witnessed a substantial transformation over 30 years since 1991 with an average growth of 6.5 per cent per annum. Going ahead, investment levels and sustained economic growth is critical for security reasons. What the country has done as a fallout of the Covid pandemic is ushering in radical reforms across a range of sectors. The private sector needs to be brought in at the heart of India’s economic growth,” said Kant.He added that pushing India towards a high growth trajectory is a key challenge. Global Economic Growth is expected to rebound about 5.5 per cent after (-)3.5 per cent in 2020 which has been the worst since post-World War.Also read: India’s active Covid-19 caseload over 2 lakh; 7 states contributing most casesKant further said that Covid-19 will likely reverse the trend of poverty alleviation. Global debt is at unprecedented levels. Global debt which was about 300 per cent is now at about 370 per cent. Global trade decline is estimated at 7 per cent in 2020. China is the only major economy in the world to see positive GDP growth in 2020. Its share in global GDP will rise even further. In the last two decades, China has gained tremendous market power in many key sectors like steel, aluminium and pharmaceuticals.Earlier, ex-home secretary, Government of India, R Mehrishi said, "Most conferences and TV channel discussions, when they talk about India’s internal and external security, fail to talk about the need for India’s economic growth and examining how strong the country’s economy is. In the face of the recent China confrontation, we used three elements —armed forces, trade measures and diplomacy to face the challenge posed to us.”He added that all these elements require the backing of a strong economy. In these days of technology, one has to be better and smarter equipped, and the technical competency will depend on the budget one has. India spends a little over 2 per cent on its defence that translates into ₹5 Lakh crores. Whereas China spends 1.3 per cent of its GDP which translates into ₹15 Lakh crores.“At a time when the enemy is often not seen, the only way to really compete with a country like China would be to have as much or more equipment than they have,” said Mehrishi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sustained-economic-growth-is-key-to-india-s-future-niti-aayog-ceo-101615636871713.html

So far, 25 houses have been built," Anil Malik of Kisan Social Army was quoted as saying by news agency ANI on Saturday. Close to 1,000-2,000 similar houses will be built in the coming days, Malik told ANI.One of the key farm leaders, Narendra Tikait, said on Thursday farmers are ready to stay put on Delhi’s borders to protest against three agricultural laws for the remaining three and half years of the Modi government's second term and the stir cannot be "culled" any which way the Centre tries. "This government has a misconception, probably because it never faced such kind of protest, but we have seen agitations and been part of those for 35 years. This government only has an experience of facing smaller protests and of getting those culled through various tactics," he told PTI.Farmers, hailing from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, have been camping at several Delhi border points, including Tikri, Singhu and Ghazipur, since November 28 last year, demanding a complete repeal of the three farm laws and a legal guarantee on the Minimum Support Price (MSP) for their crops. The Centre has denied allegations that it was trying to put an end to MSP and the mandi systems.The government, which held 11 rounds of formal talks with protesting unions before the negotiations completely broke down, has maintained that the laws are pro-farmers. It has emphasised that the protests by farmers must be seen in the context of India's democratic ethos and polity even as the ministry of external affairs (MEA) said that some vested interest groups have tried to mobilise international support against the country. The remarks from the MEA came as a push back after several foreign leaders extended support to the farmers’ protest or questioned the government’s handling of the snowballing demonstrations.The MEA has maintained most of the remarks on the internal matter of the country didn’t reflect India’s democratic ethos or the government’s outreach to the farmers."Before rushing to comment on such matters, we would urge that the facts be ascertained, and a proper understanding of the issues at hand be undertaken," the MEA said in a statement last month after comments by celebrities, including pop icon Rihanna, on the protests.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/permanent-shelters-come-up-at-delhi-border-as-farm-leaders-warn-they-won-t-budge-101615612963960.html

Hike in cases in Indore and Bhopal is a matter of concern,” Chouhan was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.Chouhan had expressed similar concerns about Indore and Bhopal on Friday too, telling reporters during a press briefing that strict measures will have to be taken to flatten the curve.

Night curfew might be clamped in Bhopal and Indore from Sunday or Monday," Chouhan said.In early March, Indore accounted for 37 per cent of the total Covid-19 cases in the state. The city was a Covid-19 hotspot during the peak of the pandemic last year and accounted for nearly 50 per cent of all cases reported in Madhya Pradesh in May of 2020.The chief minister also raised the issue of people coming in from Maharashtra, which is witnessing a high number of daily Covid-19 cases and said that arrivals from Maharashtra by air, road, and rail should be thermally scanned. He reiterated his point on Saturday by stating that “truck movement will continue from Maharashtra, but people will undergo temperature check.”The administration has been asked to hold awareness programs on social distancing, mask usage, and other Covid-19 preventative norms in cities recording more than 10 cases a day. “Awareness programs are being carried out for cities reporting over 10 cases,” said the chief minister on Saturday.Madhya Pradesh recorded 603 new cases of Covid-19 on Friday, taking the state-wide tally to 267,176.

13-03-2021||India||Don't do or say anything that could damage India's image: Naidu to RS members||Rajya Sabha Chairman M Venkaiah Naidu on Saturday urged members of the House not to do or say anything that could damage India's image and might be used by the country's enemies against it.Speaking at the inauguration of a two-day orientation programme for new members of the Upper House, Naidu stressed that "discuss, debate and decide" is the mantra of democracy and that members should not resort to disruption.He also said while free writing and expression are allowed in a democracy, they "shouldn't cause disaffection in society".Naidu called upon members not to cause disruption citing rules. He noted that Rule 267, often cited by opposition members, should be used on rare occasions as a 'Brahmastra' for emergent or extraordinary situations."The House frequently runs into problems on account of repeated recourse to certain rules," he told the new members."If you start seeking recourse to (Rule) 267, you cannot run the House. It is very rarely used. It is like 'Brahmastra', (which is used) when other 'astras' (weapons) do not succeed. If you (frequently) start taking recourse to 'Brahmastra', it becomes an 'astra'," he said.Rule 267 calls for setting aside of business of the day to take up a discussion on the issue pressed.It has been quoted by opposition members during the ongoing budget session to debate on issues like farmers' problems and high fuel prices, leading to frequent disruptions last week.Asking members to speak and work for a united and inclusive India, the Rajya Sabha chairman said, "Discussing issues which are not connected to us and going out of the way while trying to paint the country in a negative light is not going to help.""We may have political differences. We oppose each other. But at the same time, when the country is concerned, we should not do anything or say anything which will damage the country's image which our enemies will use and say this has been said in the Indian parliament."We shouldn't give them such a scope because unity, integrity, safety and security of the nation is vital for all," he said.Naidu said every stage of passing laws offers opportunities to oppose or support a bill."You have the power to block a legislation provided you have the numbers. One cannot obstruct physically. Then that is the negation of democracy," he said."Brute majorities have been used by all parties. I don't think it was used only by some and opposition parties know that the majority is given by people and the majority is decided on the floor of the House," he said.Stressing that the mantra for democracy is "discuss, debate and decide", he said let the government propose, the opposition oppose and the House dispose as there is no other way out.Opposition members have accused the government of pushing through crucial farm laws amid a din in the Upper House in September last year."People say don't pass any bill in a din. Some chairmen, after retirement, wrote about it. I have found an easy solution to this -- 'No din, no passage of the bill in the din'," Naidu said."You can't create a din and then say don't pass it (bill). Your legislative mandate is to support or oppose a bill. You can oppose and the House has to decide as the House is supreme," he noted.The Rajya Sabha chairman observed that there is a misconception about privileges that can't be invoked for criticising each other."If someone obstructs you from discharging your responsibility, it leads to privilege. If you criticise each other and say privilege is affected, it is not so," Naidu said.He said free speech and expression are allowed in a democracy but they "shouldn't cause disaffection in society".He said one has both rights and responsibilities and the presiding officer is the custodian of rules while the Chair's decision is final.A number of newly elected members of Rajya Sabha including External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar attended the programme. Deputy Chairman Harivansh was also present on the occasion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dont-do-or-say-anything-that-could-damage-india-s-image-naidu-to-rs-members-101615634170819.html

13-03-2021||India||Farmers hold protest in Haryana's Kurukshetra during event organised by JJP||A group of farmers under the banner of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) tried to force its way into the Circuit House here on Saturday, where workers of the ruling JJP had organised a function to honour a few "safai karamcharis" to mark the birthday of party chief Ajay Singh Chautala.A large police contingent was deployed in the area as a precautionary measure. The doors of the Circuit House, a state government building, were locked to prevent the farmers from entering its premises, officials said.Jannayak Janata Party (JJP) MLA Ram Karan Kala was to preside over the function. However, he skipped the event.The farmers raised slogans against the JJP MLAs and said they had not backed the opposition's no-confidence motion against the Haryana government, which was brought on farmers' issues.A leader of the farmers said they wanted to meet the MLA who had assured them sometime ago that he would support the farmers' agitation against the Centre's new farm laws but failed to support the no-confidence motion moved by the Congress against the BJP-JJP government in the state Assembly.With the intervention of the police, the farmers agreed to disperse after the organisers decided to cancel the function.Kurukshetra Station House Officer (SHO) Devinder Walia said the police kept the doors of the Circuit House locked for about an hour-and-a-half because the agitating farmers were adamant on entering the building.The protesters said they wanted to "blacken the faces of those holding the function", he said.Meanwhile, another group of farmers staged a protest and raised slogans against Independent MLA Dharam Pal Gonder, who was to attend an event in neighbouring Karnal district, alleging that the legislator had not stood with the peasants as he had voted against the opposition's no-confidence motion against the state government.The farmers reached near the spot in Karnal's Nissing, where the MLA from the Nilokheri Assembly segment was to attend an event in a "gaushala" (cow shelter).The protesters, who were carrying black flags, claimed that Gonder skipped the event in view of their protest."We had gone to Gonder's residence on March 9, where his wife was present, and we requested the family that the legislator should stand with the farmers and support the no-confidence motion. However, he chose not to support the farmers and voted against the motion," one of the protesters said.Another protester said they will not allow those MLAs, who chose not to stand with the farmers, to hold public meetings in villages."We will not allow them to hold meetings in villages till the farm laws are repealed," he said.Farmers from the state had blocked traffic in Jind and Hisar on Thursday while another group protested outside BJP MLA Asseem Goel's residence in Ambala, a day after the no-confidence motion against the Haryana government was defeated in the Assembly.The BJP-JJP government in Haryana survived the floor test on Wednesday, comfortably defeating the no-confidence motion moved against it by the main opposition Congress.The motion was defeated following a division of votes. Fifty-five members voted against the motion while 32 backed it.All the 10 MLAs of the JJP and five of the seven independent lawmakers voted against the no-confidence motion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-hold-protest-in-haryana-s-kurukshetra-during-event-organised-by-jjp-101615629814799.html

In case any passenger on board an aircraft refuse to wear mask or violates the “Covid-19 protocol for passengers” even after repeated warnings, during the course of the flight, such passenger may may be treated as ‘unruly passenger’ …. and the procedure in respect of handling such unruly passenger, as provided in the above mentioned CAR, shall be followed by the concerned airline,” the circular said.“The airport director/terminal manager, as applicable, must ensure that passengers are wearing masks properly and do maintain social distance at all times within the airport premises. In case any passenger is not following the “Covid-19 protocol”, they should be handed over to security agencies after proper warnings. If required, they may be dealt as per law,” it said.The DGCA also said that the CISF or other police personnel deployed at the entrance of the airport shall ensure that no one is allowed to enter the airport without wearing a mask. “CASO and other supervising officers must ensure this personally,” it said.Earlier this month, a judge of the Delhi High Court who watched passengers pull down their masks on board during a Kolkata-Delhi flight issued a set of guidelines that empowers the cabin crew to offload passengers who do not properly wear their masks. If the plane has already taken off, the judge ordered action should be taken against delinquent passengers that could include permanently barring them from flying.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dgca-reads-riot-act-to-flyers-violating-covid-protocol-warns-of-deboarding-101615628921729.html

Internet service providers shall remove or disable access to the websites identified in the IEE within the set time-lines," it said.Further, it said the policy would be a kind of a consolidated document for providing a level-playing field to all stakeholders, including individual consumers, MSMEs, traders, artisans, start-ups, while pursuing a development agenda which addresses growth and reduces prevalent market distortions.The policy would cover all modes of e-commerce - inventory, marketplace and hybrid model and it would be equally applicable to entities, natural and /or legal with foreign and domestic investments, the 9-page draft of the DPIIT said.Depending on parameters such as turnover, market size, active users, registered sellers, sale of merchandise value of an e-commerce operator, distinction would be made separately for e-commerce operators of significance who may be required to have additional compliance requirements.To promote exports through e-commerce, it said India Post will develop a specialized, low cost, and trackable solution targeted at e-commerce exporters for small products, with committed timelines for express delivery.Besides Foreign Post Offices will be strengthened and their numbers will be increased, so that they may act as delivery hubs, across regions.The draft also said that the policy would bring e-commerce exports on par with non-e-commerce exports by enabling online grant of drawbacks, advance authorization, EPCG (export promotion capital goods) and GST (Goods and Services Tax) refund.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-to-put-in-place-safeguards-to-prevent-data-misuse-by-unauthorised-persons-draft-e-comm-policy-101615625195122.html
13-03-2021||India||3 Congress MLAs accuse govt of discrimination against SC, ST lawmakers||Three ruling Congress lawmakers in Rajasthan, who were part of Sachin Pilot's rebellion against chief minister Ashok Gehlot last year, have accused the state government of discriminating against MLAs belonging to Scheduled Castes (SC), Scheduled Tribes (ST), and religious minorities.The allegation comes ahead of by-polls to four assembly seats in the state. The by-poll schedule is yet to be announced and they are expected to be held within the next two months.The Congress has a wafer-thin majority of 104 in the 200-member state assembly. Lone Rashtriya Lok Dal and 12 Independent lawmakers support its government in the state, where SC, ST, and Muslim communities account for about 40% of the population.Ramesh Meena, who was a minister before the rebellion, said he would not hesitate in resigning if their problems are not addressed and that he has sought a meeting with Congress leader Rahul Gandhi to discuss the matter. He said ministers do not meet lawmakers such as Ameen Khan and Babulal Bairwa."If an SC, ST member approaches ministers, they are scolded. Why this discrimination with our people?" asked Meena who got into an argument with the assembly Speaker over seating arrangement in the House this week.Meena referred to three previous budgets and questioned what did SC, ST, and minority communities' lawmakers get for development works in their constituencies. "And what development is happening in Jodhpur...the chief minister's... hometown." Meena accused the government of trying to suppress the voice of lawmakers representing SC, ST, and minorities by giving them seats in the Assembly without microphones. “When we are not being heard, then where do the people from SC, ST, and OBC [other backward classes] go. Our voice is not taken seriously. It is a serious issue. Our government was formed with the support of people from SC, ST, and minorities... and now discrimination is done with them.”Meena said that he was a minister and could have remained silent to retain his ministry. “I do not want to become a minister but cannot remain silent if discrimination is done with us. I am raising my voice against the acts that weaken Congress. If you do not allow us to speak, give funds for development works. Ministers do not meet us and then you call us the backbone of the government. What is it?"Murari Lal Meena, another lawmaker, said the development works have taken place in his area but the work of several people in his constituency is not being done. He said that party leaders consider SC, ST, and minorities as the Congress's backbone. But, he added, the backbone is being weakened in the assembly, at the government, and the party level. "This will not benefit the party and the party should look into it."Ved Prakash Solanki, the third lawmaker, said 50 lawmakers without microphones in the assembly are mostly from SC, ST, and minority communities. "The chief whip should have thought about the criteria; seniors are side-lined... first-timers are sitting in front [assembly rows]. It is not one lawmaker's resentment... it should be corrected. Those who helped in forming the government should be taken care of."In July last year, Pilot had camped in the National Capital Region with a group of Congress legislators backing him as the rebellion raised questions about the stability of the state government. He agreed to a truce after his meeting with Gandhi a month later in New Delhi and put an end to the uncertainty.HT reached out to Congress leaders for reactions, but they refused to comment immediately.Political analyst Sunny Sebastian said the lack of microphones cannot be the real issue as social distancing due to Covid-19 has warranted distanced seating arrangement in the House. "The three, who rebelled along with Sachin Pilot are making statements together, which shows that something is... [wrong]. However, it does not look like a revolt...but resentment... maybe as they are out of power," he said. He added the three making charges of discrimination certainly sends a wrong message in public, especially when by-polls to four seats are due."The Congress needs to resolve the grievances before it gets out of hand."Opposition Bharatiya Janata Party leader Satish Poonia said the allegations of the three lawmakers show that all is not well with their party.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/3-congress-mlas-accuse-govt-of-discrimination-against-sc-st-lawmakers-101615624829597.html

13-03-2021||India||Explained: Lightning, its effects and precautions to be taken||One person died and three others sustained injuries on Friday when a tree under which they were taking shelter from the rain was struck by lightning in Sector 82 of Haryana’s Gurugram. All four of them, the staff of the horticulture department, were rushed to the hospital where 38-year-old Ram Prasad later succumbed to his injuries. Officials later said Shiv Dutt, 43, Lali, 32, and Anil Kumar, 32, were stable and recovering after the accident in the residential township Vatika India Next.On camera: Lightning hits tree in Gurugram, injures 4 who took shelterHere’s a look at what is lightning and how does it take place:What is lightning?Lightning is a sudden electrostatic discharge during an electrical storm with a frequency of around 40-50 times a second on Earth, some of which may be seen even before the thunder is heard. But sometimes, distant lightning can be seen but maybe too far away for thunder to be heard. Lightning is of three forms: intra-cloud lightning, cloud to cloud lightning and cloud-to-ground lightning. Cloud-to-ground lightning is the most common form of lightning and accounts for about 25 per cent of cases in the world.How does lightning take place?During a thunderstorm due to separation of charge, the air currents start to move upwards while the water droplets simultaneously move downwards. Positive charges, therefore, start collecting near the upper edge of the cloud and the negative charges gather near the lower edge as well as close to the ground. When the magnitude of the charges becomes huge, the water droplets which are in the air start acting as the conductor of the charges and thus, the charges flow to meet, resulting in lightning and thunder.What are the precautions which should be taken against lightning?During lightning, taking shelter under a tree or lying on the ground can be very dangerous. Staying indoors is safer but touching electrical fittings, wires, metal and water must be avoided.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/explained-lightning-its-effects-and-precautions-to-be-taken-101615620169466.html
13-03-2021||India||US development bank to assist India's Biological E for Quad Vaccine Partnership||The US development bank will assist India’s biopharmaceutical company Biological E to produce one billion doses of Covid-19 vaccines to be rolled out by the end of 2022 under the ambitious new vaccine partnership unveiled at the first Quad Summit.The four countries agreed on Friday to pool their financial resources, manufacturing capacities and logistical strengths to ramp up manufacture and distribution of Covid-19 vaccines across the region as part of efforts to boost post-pandemic recovery.The initiative will create additional manufacturing capacities in India, the world’s largest producer of vaccines, to make doses developed in the US, including the Johnson & Johnson candidate. This will be done with financing from the US and Japan.Australia will help overcome last mile and logistical delivery issues and assist in delivering the vaccines to countries in Southeast Asia, the Indian Ocean and the Pacific Islands.The US International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) has announced it will “finance increased capacity to support Biological E’s effort to produce at least 1 billion doses of Covid-19 vaccines by the end of 2022”.This will be done with Stringent Regulatory Authorization (SRA) and the World Health Organization’s (WHO) Emergency Use Listing.The move is part of DFC’s Global Health and Prosperity Initiative, under which it is increasing manufacturing, production and distribution capacity for vaccines.The Quad Vaccine Partnership was seen as the most significant deliverable of the first summit of the leaders of India, Australia, Japan and the US. Observers believe the move will help counter China’s influence across the Indo-Pacific while at the same time signalling that the Quad is evolving from a group that only discusses strategic approaches to cooperating in definite areas.DFC chief operating officer David Marchick said, “It is hard to conceive of an investment with a greater developmental impact than using our financial tools to increase the capacity of vaccine manufacturing to help developing countries in Asia and around the world respond to Covid-19 and other diseases.”He added, “Expanding vaccine manufacturing, especially the Covid-19 vaccine and boosters, will help increase vaccination rates and protect communities around the world.”Partnering with Biological E, which is a woman-run business, will also advance DFC’s “2X Women’s Initiative” to promote global gender equity.Mahima Datla is currently the managing director of Biological E, which was founded in 1953, and became the first Indian private sector company to enter the vaccines business in 1962. The firm launched commercial operations in the US in 2019.TheDFC is also working to strengthen the vaccine supply chain and last mile logistics for distribution. Under its Global Health and Prosperity Initiative, DFC will invest between $5 million and $500 million on eligible projects, including equity and debt financing, political risk insurance and technical development.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/us-development-bank-to-assist-india-s-biological-e-for-quad-vaccine-partnership-101615621618815.html
13-03-2021||India||Week-long lockdown in Nagpur from Monday: A look at what’s open and what’s not||Nagpur, one of the worst hit-regions in Maharashtra other than Pune and Mumbai, will be placed under a week-long lockdown from Monday, March 15, till March 21 due to a recent spike in the cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). It is the first city in India that is going back to a complete lockdown after authorities had started lifting nationwide curbs in June last year. The decision was taken after Nagpur’s guardian minister Nitin Raut chaired a meeting of top district officials on Thursday.Nagpur is contributing the most number of Covid-19 cases towards the state’s daily tally. On Friday, 1,729 cases were reported in Nagpur - the second-highest in Maharashtra - which pushed the division’s caseload to 248,912 of which 4,893 people have died. Infections have been on the rise in Nagpur since mid-February with the daily tally breaching the 1,000-mark on February 24.Hundreds of people were seen flouting social distancing rules on Saturday morning at the city’s Cotton Market. Images from ANI showed that many of them were not wearing a face mask or any face covering. A similar situation was also seen at a liquor shop in the city on Friday. Last week, the Nagpur Municipal Corporation had extended curbs on several activities till Sunday (March 14). These curbs, which ordered the closure of educational institutions, weekly markets, marriage halls and other social, political and cultural events, were first introduced on February 22.Amid the worrying situation, here are the instructions that residents will have to adhere to during the week-long lockdown:1. Shops selling essential commodities such as vegetables, fruits and medicines and milk booths will remain open during the lockdown. Liquor can be sold online.2. Guardian minister Raut appealed to the residents on Thursday that they should not move out of their homes unnecessarily during the lockdown.3.

13-03-2021||India||Bihar minister blames Bangladesh treaty, Farakka barrage for floods and droughts||Bihar’s water resources minister Sanjay Kumar Jha on Friday blamed the treaty with Bangladesh for sharing the Ganga waters and the “faulty design” of the Farakka barrage for floods in the state in the monsoon season and drought-like situation for the rest of the year.The Farakka barrage has often been criticized for floods in Bihar due to excessive siltation in the Ganga. On Friday, Jha also put it in his line of fire.“Faulty design of the Farakka barrage has led to a heavy deposit of silt in the Ganga in the upstream up to Buxar. This leads to flooding of the entire plain along the river’s course during the rains. Post-monsoon, Bihar rivers have to supplement the quantum of flow in the Ganga to provide 1400 cusec of water... the original flow in the river gets reduced to just 400 cusecs as it enters the state,” Jha said at a seminar.He cited chief minister Nitish Kumar’s pre-poll pledge to take water to every farm in the next five years and added that Bihar would be the next state after Punjab and Haryana to reap the benefits of a Green Revolution. "...the state government is working on ambitious projects like Jal-Jeevan-Haryali and Har Khet Ko Pani for sustainable development of rural economy...,” said Jha. He added that the groundwork to provide the water to every farm would start in April.Jha said a detailed survey for this had started on January 18 across Bihar. “So far, 58% of rural areas have been surveyed and 12,188 schemes have been finalised...after technical feasibility reports. However, a comprehensive strategy over the way to irrigate the farms would be decided later..."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bihar-minister-blames-bangladesh-treaty-farakka-barrage-for-floods-and-droughts-101615619994315.html

13-03-2021||India||One arrested for murder of BJP booth president in Assam||Police in Assam’s Tinsukia district have arrested one person for the murder of a booth president of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Friday ahead of assembly election in the state.Debananda Gogoi, president of BJP’s Buridihing gaon panchayat was stabbed to death in Nagaon area of Bordumsa in Margherita assembly seat on Friday evening.Since polling in Margherita is scheduled to be held in the first phase on March 27, it was immediately suspected that the reason for the murder could be linked to political rivalry.The murder was allegedly committed by one Joychandra Gogoi, who was nabbed late on Friday night by Tinsukia police. Though some reports say that the accused is affiliated with a newly formed regional party, the police did not confirm it.“The accused was nabbed hours after the incident. Both the deceased and the accused are related. The accused seems a bit mentally unstable and has a history of violent behaviour. There seems to be no political motive behind the murder,” said Jitmol Doley, deputy inspector general of police (DIGP), Tinsukia.The BJP has condemned the murder.“Deeply saddened to know about the killing of Shri Debananda Gogoi, BJP booth president of Buridihing gaon panchayat in Tinsukia. Such brutal inhumane act will not be tolerated,” tweeted BJP’s Assam unit chief Ranjeet Kumar Dass.Senior Assam minister Himanta Biswa Sarma also expressed shock and anguish at the murder and expressed condolences to the family.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/one-arrested-for-murder-of-bjp-booth-president-in-assam-101615615173945.html

13-03-2021||India||Covid-19 cases rising in 6 states, isn’t time to be negligent: Harsh Vardhan||Union health minister Harsh Vardhan said on Friday people must follow social distancing norms and wear masks as cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in several parts of the country reflected a spike in recent days. The health minister’s advice to ensure Covid-appropriate norms comes amid fears that the second wave of the coronavirus pandemic has started in India, according to data analysed by Hindustan Times.“India has the lowest fatality rate and now the vaccine is here but this is not the time to be negligent regarding Covid appropriate behaviour. Cases are rising in six states due to people's carelessness. I urge all to abide by social distancing and wear masks,” Vardhan told news agency ANI.Follow latest updates on Covid-19 here The pace at which cases in Punjab are climbing is the highest in the country. As of Friday, the northern state’s seven-day average of daily cases went up 509% from the trough after the first wave. This almost eight times the national average. Maharashtra, which is witnessing the second-highest resurgence of cases, saw a jump of 331% from its post-peak low seen for the week ending February 11. The western state on Friday logged 15,817 fresh cases, breaching the 15,000 daily case count for the first time in 162 days, according to the state’s health department. Kerala, on the other hand, reported 1,780 new cases taking the state’s infection tally to 1,087,443.The grim figures come at a time when testing in India is at least 40% off its peak. In the past week, 725,626 samples were tested every day for Covid-19 across the country on average, against a peak of 1,196,972 tests a day on average for the week ending October 10, 2020.Other states reporting a high number of daily Covid-19 cases are Kerala, Karnataka, Gujarat, and Tamil Nadu. Following the upward trend, the country’s active caseload on Saturday surpassed the 200,000-mark, for the first time since January 19, according to the latest figures released by the health ministry.According to an expert team sent to Maharashtra, the Covid-inappropriate behaviour, pandemic fatigue, gram panchayat elections, marriage season and opening of schools, crowded public transport were the possible reasons for the upsurge in cases in the western state. While local administrations have already put in place full or partial lockdowns in several districts, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray has warned that they may have to shut down more places if the cases continue to rise.The central government is regularly reviewing the status of Covid-19 containment and public health measures with states and Union territories reporting an upsurge in daily new cases, the ministry said in a statement. “Recently, the Centre rushed high-level Public Health teams to Maharashtra and Punjab to assist in COVID-19 control and containment measures in view of the recent spike in cases in these States,” the ministry added.The government said it had earlier also deputed high-level teams to Maharashtra, Kerala, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Punjab, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, and Jammu and Kashmir to support them in their fight against the spike in Covid-19 cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indias-covid-19-case-fatality-rate-lowest-but-we-can-t-be-negligent-harsh-vardhan-101615612402816.html

He was tested for Covid-19 on February 27 and charged ₹1,500. The patient was listed under Jan Arogya category.Viraj Anand, a one-year-old child (CR No. 109112100029700) from Jharkhand’s Godda was admitted at the burns and plastic surgery department on February 16. He was tested for Covid-19 on February 16 and billed ₹1,500 for the test. The patient was listed against the Rashtriya Bal Swasthya Karyakram.Two-year-old Gauri Shankar Kumar (CR No. 109112100208094) from Bihar’s Saharsa district was admitted to the paediatrics department on March 9 and charged ₹1,500 for Covid-19 test.Rakhi Singh, 45, (CR No. 109112100075388) from Pirpaiti in Bhagalpur district, was admitted to the general surgery department on March 6 and charged ₹1,500 for Covid-19 RT PCR test.There are more such examples of violation of the December 1, 2020 Bihar government order, which read: “Anyone charging more than ₹800 for the said (RT PCR) test… will be taken as a violation of the Epidemic Disease Act, 1897 (Amended)…”Patna civil surgeon Dr Vibha Kumari Singh said, “We will seek an explanation on this from the AIIMS administration.”AIIMS director, Dr Singh, however, was quick to acknowledge the slip."Charging general patients for RT PCT test was an oversight, caused because of a software glitch. As long as ours was a dedicated Covid-19 hospital till December, last year, all charges, including the cost of drugs, tests and consumables came free of cost to patients. Ever since we began admitting non-Covid patients from January this year, the payment category in our computer software changed to what was set during the pre-Covid period and it began charging patients for RT PCR test as well," said Dr Singh.“I have issued instructions to make the RT PCR test free to all patients with immediate effect,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aiimspatna-violates-govt-order-on-rt-pcr-test-blames-it-on-software-glitch-101615609938937.html
13-03-2021||India||UN experts ask India to release Christian Michel from ‘arbitrary’ detention||A panel of UN experts has called on the Indian government to immediately release Christian Michel, the alleged middleman in the AgustaWestland VVIP helicopter deal, as his detention was arbitrary and violates the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.The Working Group on Arbitrary Detention (WGAD), which operates under the office of the UN high commissioner for human rights, formally released its findings in Michel’s case late on Friday in Geneva.Michel, a British national, has been held in India since December 2018 after being extradited from the United Arab Emirates (UAE).The WGAD was very critical in its evaluation of the handling of Michel’s case by the governments of the UAE and India and said both countries should “accord him an enforceable right to compensation and other reparations, in accordance with international law”.Even before the formal release of WGAD’s opinion, the external affairs ministry had last month rejected the group’s reported findings and said the conclusions were based on “limited information, biased allegations from an unidentified source and on an inaccurate understanding of India’s criminal justice system”.There was no immediate response from Indian officials to WGAD’s report and this report will be updated when there is one.The WGAD said that, “taking into account all the circumstances of the case, the appropriate remedy would be for the Government of India to release Mr Michel immediately”.It added, “In the current context of the global Covid-19 pandemic and the threat that it poses in places of detention, the Working Group calls upon the Government of India to take urgent action to ensure the immediate release of Mr Michel.”The WGAD also urged the governments of India and the UAE to “ensure a full and independent investigation of the circumstances surrounding the arbitrary deprivation of liberty of Mr Michel and to take appropriate measures against those responsible for the violation of his rights”.The group concluded that Michel’s detention violated both the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and referred his case to the UN “Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and the Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health for appropriate action”.Michel is currently being held in Delhi’s Tihar Jail. He was living in Dubai when India sought his extradition for involvement in alleged irregularities in the 2010 deal to acquire 12 AgustaWestland helicopters worth 556.2 million euros for the transportation of VVIPs. At the time, Michel was a middleman and an external consultant for a subsidiary of AgustaWestland.The chairman of Finmeccanica, the previous owner of AgustaWestland, and the chief executive officer of AgustaWestland were acquitted of charges of corruption in the helicopter deal by courts in Italy in 2019. Michel has denied involvement in wrong-doing and also pointed to the acquittal in Italy of the two others as proof that there was no corruption in the deal.The WGAD report cited a source as saying that there were several lapses in the handling of Michel’s case after he was arrested in Dubai in 2017 following an extradition request in connection with allegedly organising the payment of bribes to Indian politicians and officials for the helicopter deal.The source told WGAD that “Indian authorities visited Mr Michel in Dubai on several occasions, in the presence of local officials, and interrogated him for hours before getting him to sign statements implicating the Gandhi family, under threat of further prosecution”.After being out on bail, Michel was arrested again by Dubai authorities in June 2018 and detained without charge, the source said. After again being granted bail in July 2018, the Dubai Court of Appeal authorised India’s extradition request on September 2, 2018.“Mr Michel was told that his extradition had been granted in exchange for the earlier seizure and return of a high-profile detainee to Dubai despite the detainee’s plea for asylum. The detainee was extradited by the Indian forces, which had intercepted his yacht in international waters off the coast of Goa in March 2018, after the Prime Minister of India had made a personal telephone call to the Prime Minister of the United Arab Emirates and ruler of the Emirate of Dubai,” the WGAD report said.The source told WGAD that on December 4, 2018, Michel was “reportedly handcuffed, blindfolded and transported by private jet to India, in a hurried and unlawful manner that prevented him from challenging any decision”.In reply to communications from WGAD, the Indian government submitted a response on Michel’s case in June last year, disputing the “allegation that due process was not followed in Mr Michel’s extradition”. The government denied “any procedural deficiencies” in the extradition request.The response from the UAE government was submitted after the deadline set by WGAD and was “therefore considered late and the Working Group cannot accept the response”, the report said.The WGAd further said “the burden of proof should be understood to rest upon the Government [of India] if it wishes to refute the allegations. Mere assertions by the Government that lawful procedures have been followed are not sufficient to rebut the source’s allegations.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/un-experts-ask-india-to-release-christian-michel-from-arbitrary-detention-101615610670073.html

13-03-2021||India||Forcible entry not seen on SUV with explosives found near Ambani's house: Police||There were no marks indicating a forcible opening of doors of the Scorpio which was found with explosives near industrialist Mukesh Ambani's house last month, a senior police official said here on Friday.This led the investigators of Mumbai Crime Branch to suspect that it may have been opened with a duplicate key when it was stolen, he said.The case has been now taken over by the National Investigation Agency (NIA).Mansukh Hiran, in whose possession the SUV was, had claimed that it was stolen from Vikhroli area a week before it was found outside Ambani's house. Hiran was found dead in mysterious circumstances on March 5."We did not find any marks suggesting that the doors were opened using force," said the official who was part of the crime branch probe team.But the forensic lab report of the vehicle was awaited, he added.Hiran had said he had left it on the road as its steering got jammed on the night of February 17.Meanwhile, on Friday an NIA team visited Thane police officials to get information related to the case, sources said.The Maharashtra ATS, which is probing Hiran's death, also recorded some persons' statements in Thane, sources added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/forcible-entry-not-seen-on-suv-with-explosives-found-near-ambani-s-house-police-101615606218817.html

That will be the kind of investment that we will be kind of seeking to do every year. We are estimating manpower requirement of 300 people in about five years," Radhakrishnan Durairaj, executive director of NSIL said on Friday in Bengaluru.He said that the company, which was incorporated in March 2019, will raise capital with a mix of equity and debt.Durairaj said that the company had revenues of ₹300 crore in the previous fiscal and around ₹400 crore in the current year. He added that the NSIL anticipates around ₹400 crore revenue next fiscal as well as it looks to scale up operations.NSIL, with a paid up capital of ₹10 crore and authorised capital of ₹100 crore, was allocated ₹700 crore by the Union government in its budget 2021-22. However, the newly formed entity is still working out the modalities to get this money.With a robust order book and its offer of niche services, NSIL looks to capitalise on demand for launch of commercial satellites among other services to raise more revenues.NSIL has four dedicated launches lined up over the next couple of years and most of its revenues earned so far have been through services, the officials added.“We have contracts for four more dedicated launches but our NDAs (non-disclosure agreements) prevent us from revealing more details. All are foreign satellites,” he added.With more services on offer, NSIL is looking to scale up operations and said that it was extremely competitive in the mixed category launches or dedicated missions but faces threats in the ride-share category which has several other global players.“We were quite competitive commercially until recently. But now many of the international players have slashed their prices quite substantially. NSIL is not facing any major challenges but they (international players) are still quite a threat for us (NSIL),” he said.Global players like SpaceX, led billionaire Elon Musk among others are also on the market for commercial launches of private satellites for various applications like communications, broadband, DTH, GPS and earth monitoring among other uses.However, the company said that it has an edge over the others in the higher payload categories or dedicated missions of under 1000 kgs where the client bears the entire cost of the launch. The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) on February 28, successfully launched Amazonia-I and 18 co-passenger satellites from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Sriharikota in Andhra Pradesh.The space agency has already executed four PSLV missions for 45 auxiliary commercial satellites, apart from Amazonia-I.“NSIL has established itself as a major space service provider in a very short period and in the not so distant future, you will see it emerging as a key player in all areas of space sector and space-based services in India with a significant global presence,” NSIL chairman and managing director C Narayanan said.According to ISRO, Amazonia-I is an optical earth observation satellite of National Institute for Space Research (INPE) and would strengthen the existing structure by providing remote sensing data to users for monitoring deforestation in the Amazon region and analysis of diversified agriculture across the Brazilian territory.Amazonia-I was the first dedicated commercial mission of the NSIL.The 18 co-passenger satellites onboard the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV)-C51, considered the workhorse of the space agency, included four from IN-SPACe and 14 from NSIL. Only one of the 14 commercial satellites was from India while the remaining 13 were from the USA. ISRO has put 342 customer satellites from 34 countries into orbit so far.The company has also floated RFPs (request for proposals) to five Indian companies or consortia to build PSLV launch vehicles but Durairaj said that there will be no transfer of technology to these firms and that it will only be through licenced production.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nsil-to-invest-rs-10-000-crore-in-5-years-to-launch-commercial-satellites-101615606655687.html

He added the release of the "movie on my life" may prejudice the case and affect his right to a fair and impartial trial.“As the court has turned down our plea, we will have no other option but to approach the Bombay high court to stop the release of this movie, as it violates fundamental rights of my clients,” said Pandey.Rao, an alleged member of the Chhota Rajan gang, is lodged in Navi Mumbai's Taloja jail in connection with an extortion case.Rao survived a shootout with the Mumbai police in 1998 before he was arrested. While he was in jail, he is believed to have come in contact with members of the Rajan gang. Rao has claimed that soon he climbed the ladder within the gang and became one of its key members.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mcoca-court-junks-gangster-s-plea-to-stay-release-of-mumbai-saga-101615605219929.html

Similarly, social distancing norms were flouted at another place in Nagpur as people gathered outside a liquor store ahead of a week-long lockdown starting Monday.Amid a spike in Covid-19 cases in Maharashtra, the state government on Thursday decided to impose a lockdown in Nagpur district from March 15 to 21.Only essential services such as vegetable and fruit shops and milk booths will stay open, according to the order issued by the Nagpur district administration."Complete lockdown to remain imposed in Nagpur City Police Commissionerate area from March 15 to March 21. Essential services will continue," said Nagpur Guardian Minister Nitin Raut."Maharashtra reported 13,659 new Covid-19 cases and 54 deaths in the last 24 hours. With this, the cumulative count of the cases in the state has reached 22,52,057. The state currently has 1,00,240 active coronavirus cases. Registering as many as 9,913 recoveries in the last 24 hours, Maharashtra's total recovery count went up to 20,99,207," the Union Health Ministry informed on Thursday morning.The Union Health Ministry on Thursday during its weekly press conference expressed concerns over the Covid-19 situation in Maharashtra and said that the reduced testing, tracing and lack of Covid appropriate behaviours have led to the surge in active cases in the state."We are very worried about Maharashtra. This is a serious matter. This has two lessons- don't take the virus for granted and if we have to remain Covid free, then, we need to follow Covid appropriate behaviour," Member (Health), NITI Aayog Dr VK Paul said.Echoing a similar remark, ICMR DG Balram Bhargava said that Maharashtra has shown a worrisome trend."The mutant strain has not been found incriminating in this surge in cases. It is just related to reduced testing, tracking & tracing and Covid inappropriate behaviour and large congregations," he said.Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on Thursday said strict lockdown measures will be enforced in some parts of the state to contain the spread of Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ahead-of-lockdown-hundreds-flout-social-distancing-norms-in-nagpur-market-101615604089926.html
13-03-2021||India||BJP MLA tries to drink sanitiser in Odisha Assembly over paddy procurement row||A BJP legislator on Friday rocked the legislative assembly when he tried to drink hand sanitiser to protest the state government’s “failure” to procure paddy of thousands of farmers in his area in the western district of Bargarh.BJP MLA from Deogarh, Subash Chandra Panigrahi who earlier in the morning had threatened to immolate himself over the paddy procurement issues was about to gulp the contents of hand sanitiser bottle when parliamentary affairs minister Bikram Arukha, senior BJD legislator Pramila Mallick and other legislators stopped him.“We should raise the farmers’ issue in the Assembly. But, such an act in the House is not acceptable,” said BJD MLA Ananta Das.Panigrahi's shocking display came while state food supplies minister Ranendra Pratap Swain was reading out a statement about the status of paddy procurement in the state in the 2020-21 kharif marketing season. Swain said so far 60.44 lakh tonne of paddy have been procured by the government through several market yards, considerably higher than last year's collection of 53.31 lakh tonne."This is an all-time record. We would continue to procure paddy till March 31 and ensure that no genuine farmer is left out," the minister said.This season's record procurement came on the back of close to 15 lakh farmers registering as against 12.35 lakh last season.In the morning, the BJP and Congress members had stalled the Assembly proceedings alleging that the procurement procedure was faulty. Congress leader Narasingha Mishra alleged that paddy procurement in the state was in a state of disarray."The state government had earlier assured the Assembly that paddy would be procured from the genuine farmers and criminal action would be taken against the middlemen. Lots of paddy have still not been cleared from the mandis and the minister’s statement on the floor in the previous session was a farce. Why should the Assembly function if the decision taken here is not honoured,” asked Mishra.Leader of Opposition Pradipta Kumar Naik (BJP) said even after the assurance of the minister, paddy is not being procured from the farmers. He alleged that the state government has funds to organise cricket matches at the panchayat level, but it can’t procure paddy from the farmers.Despite the record paddy procurement this kharif season, farmers across the state have resorted to protests paralysing traffic movements expressing their anger over the paddy procurement system. Over the last few years, paddy procurement has been playing a critical role in the state's rural economy. This year around ₹10,800 crore have been transferred to the accounts of the farmers who sold their paddy at the mandis.With immediate payment assured for their harvest, farmers and farmer organisations in Odisha want the government to buy all their harvest. On Friday, farmer leader Mahendra Patel of Sundargarh district led a protest of farmers in Talasara area demanding that the government renew the lapsed tokens that would enable the farmers sell their paddy. Similarly, farmers under the banner of Navanirman Krushak Samiti stopped traffic on state highway 65 at Badamba-Narasinghpur area of Cuttack district demanding that the paddy be purchased.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-mla-tries-to-drink-sanitiser-in-odisha-assembly-over-paddy-procurement-row-101615602627185.html

This means that Delhi is now reporting, on average, 200 more cases every day than what it was less than three weeks ago.With 72,031 tests conducted, the positivity rate – proportion of samples that test positive among total tested – stood at 0.60%, which was again the highest since January 9.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageTo keep new infections in check, Delhi government officials said they are focussing on tracing as many as 30 contacts for every positive case recorded. “We are focussing on aggressive contact tracing. For every case, we are tracing at least 30 contacts and keeping them under surveillance. We are trying to contain the infection before it has a chance to spread again,” said a senior district level official on condition of anonymity.Only half as many contacts were being traced on average in early-November, when Delhi had witnessed its third surge in the number of infections.Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain had in November said, “If a person tests positive then his entire family and the people in contact have to be tested, thus more cases of Covid-19 were recorded. Earlier six-seven contacts of a positive person were traced, now this number has crossed 15.”The district official also added that in addition to contact tracing, focus was also on increasing the number of tests and vaccinations.The Centre on Thursday had said that Delhi-NCR was also becoming one of the regions of concern where Covid-19 was seeing an uptick.“There is spike in cases in Maharashtra and Kerala too. But there is a difference. The positivity rates in those states are high. In Delhi, the positivity rate has been lower than 1% for more than two months now. The government is prepared in all aspects of Covid-19 management, and we have maintained tests at scaled-up levels,” Delhi’s health minister Satyendar Jain told reporters outside the Delhi assembly on Friday.Dr Jugal Kishore, head of the department of community medicine at Safdarjung hospital said, “We need to continue following the Covid-19 norms; there is Holi this month and celebrations should be curtailed to ensure we do not see a surge like after Diwali,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uptick-in-delhi-covid-graph-continues-431-new-cases-most-in-over-2-months-101615580697154.html
13-03-2021||India||Understanding Kerala’s unique political economy||When EMS Namboodiripad of the Communist Party of India (CPI) was elected chief minister of Kerala in 1957 , he became the first communist leader in India to govern a state. With the Communist Party of India (Marxist), or CPI (M), having lost power in West Bengal and Tripura – two states where it ruled without interruption for decades – Kerala is now the last place in India where a communist party runs an elected government.The CPI (M) and its partners in the Left Democratic Front (LDF) rightly trace their legacy to the times of EMS. But the challenges facing the current CPI (M) are very different from what EMS faced. The reason is that Kerala’s political economy has undergone a radical shift in the last six-and-a-half decades, and particularly in the latter half of this period. The communists captured power in the state by championing the politics of radical land redistribution and improvised on its economic benefits with rapid advances in the social sector, especially literacy.Today, agriculture has a negligible role in the state’s economy. The state’s demographic profile is the most skewed in India towards people from older age groups. This also means that unskilled workers earn way more than what their peers get in any other Indian state. A lot of the state’s well-being and its growing consumerism are sustained by overseas remittances, particularly from those in oil-exporting countries in West Asia. These characteristics make Kerala a unique outlier in India’s political economy landscape.1. Kerala has among the most equally sized farms in India, but there are hardly any farmers left nowFarm-land concentration, when seen by size of operational holdings is among the most equal in Kerala. According to the latest available data (2012-13) from the National Sample Survey Organisation’s (NSSO) report on Household Ownership and Operational Holdings in India, Gini’s coefficient for size distribution of operational holdings in Kerala was 0.342 (0 and 1 represent perfect equality and inequality) against an all-India average of 0.516. Only four states, West Bengal, Jammu and Kashmir, Odisha and Himachal Pradesh had a lower Gini’s coefficient on this count than Kerala.However, what separates Kerala when it comes to farming is the fact that there are hardly any farmers in the state. The NSSO report found that Kerala had the smallest share of households engaged in cultivation. Even among households engaged in cultivation, Kerala had the highest share of households where no other member apart from the head of the household was part of agricultural activity. This means that not only does Kerala have the lowest employment dependence on agriculture, it also has the lowest amount of what is often referred to as disguised unemployment in agriculture.2. Kerala has the highest unskilled wages in the country due to its ageing populationThe Left-leaning political culture in Kerala also means that the state witnesses a large number of political protests and shutdowns. Even when things are normal, unions are an influential player in Kerala’s economy. Among the most historically infamous union-related practices in Kerala is what is referred to as Nokku Kooli, a Malayalam word which literally translates to “wages for watching”. This involves unions charging a fee for “overseeing” loading and unloading activities at residential or commercial enterprises, if their demanded wages were not agreed to. While the prevalence of Nokku Kooli has come down in the recent past, and attempts to end it have had bipartisan support, Kerala still has the highest wages for unskilled workers in India. Kerala’s wage premium is only expected to increase going forward due to its aging population. The share of persons aged 50 and above was 38.7% in Kerala as on March 1, 2021 according to projections by the Report of The Technical Group on Population Projections November, 2019. This number was just 28.2% at the all-India level. This means blue-collar unions do not need to resort to strong-arm tactics anymore to preserve their material interests in the state.3. Story of remittance tailwinds in the Kerala economyKerala is India’s only state with four functional international airports: Thiruvananthapuram, Cochin, Kannur and Calicut. The massive demand for international air travel needs to be seen with the widespread international emigration from Kerala, primarily to the oil-exporting countries in west Asia. A 2020 paper in the Indian Journal of Labour Economics by KP Kannan and KS Hari put the number of Kerala emigrants abroad, with an identifiable household to report in Kerala, at 2.12 million in 2020, which the authors noted, “works out to a little more than 6% of the population but 17 to 18% of its workforce”.A steady rise in international emigration from Kerala has also meant a growing flow of remittance incomes. Kannan and Hari estimate that the share of remittances in the Kerala’s Net State Domestic Product (NSDP) increased from almost nothing (0.57%) in 1972-73 to almost one-fourth in the first and second decade of the century.While this number has come down since, it was still a significant 13.3% in 2019-20, the latest period for which data is available. The paper also constructs something called modified state income (MSI) to account for the positive impact of remittance incomes on official NSDP, which the authors argue does not capture the positive impact of remittances adequately. The paper argues that additional remittance incomes have led to a reduction in propensity to consume and an increase in propensity to save.The savings have primarily been directed to house construction, investment in gold and financial assets, the authors note. Kerala had the highest share of construction (13.7%) in its Gross Value Added among India’s states in 2018-19, the latest period for which data is available for all states in the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy’s (CMIE) database. The all-India share was just 8% in 2018-19. It is ironical that the last surviving communist bastion is a state where labour is scarce and remittances are a key driver of the economy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/understanding-kerala-s-unique-political-economy-101615579469570.html

His demands are the same as that of late Swami Nigmanand, Swami Gyan Swarup Sanand who gave up their lives for the cause of the holy Ganga, ecology and society.Brahamchari Atmabodhanand had last staged 41 days of agitation in February-March 2020, on similar demands while prior to that he had been on a record 194 day agitation from October 2018 till May 2019.Swami Shivanand Saraswati has asked new chief minister Tirath Singh Rawat to take cognizance of Matri Sadan ashramite’s agitation saying when seers are agitating rulers can’t stay happy referring to the ouster of Trivendra Singh Rawat from the CM’s post blaming him for ignoring the seer’s agitation when he was chief minister.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/medha-patkar-lends-support-to-haridwar-seer-who-is-fasting-to-save-river-ganga-101615578963581.html

13-03-2021||India||2 days after CM was replaced, BJP changes Uttarakhand unit chief||Two days after the chief minister was replaced in Uttarakhand, the BJP on Friday changed the state present by replacing Bansidhar Bhagat with Madan Kaushik, who was a cabinet minister and spokesperson in the Trivendra Singh Rawat government.This is being seen as part of the BJP’s efforts to overhaul the party and government with just one year left for the elections amid reports that all was not well with the BJP regime in the hill state, prompting the high command to make such major changes so close to the elections in the state.Madan Kaushik, while talking to reporters after his appointment, said that this should not be seen in any negative way as the party can give responsibility to anyone whether he is in serving in the government or in the party. “We will win the 2022 elections in a big way and we will pass this agni-pariksha by winning over 60 seats (in the 70-member assembly),” he said.Kaushik, a four-time MLA from Haridwar constituency, has served as a cabinet minister between 2007 to 2012 in the governments of BC Khanduri and Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank. Kaushik was first elected as MLA in 2002 and subsequently in 2007, 2012 and 2017. In the previous government, as spokesperson, he not only was the face of what the government was doing but also its chief defender, whenever the government was going through a difficult situation.Bansidhar Bhagat, who has been replaced by Kaushik, said the party has taken the decision after considering all aspects and whatever new responsibility he is given, he will try to work to his best capacity in the interest of the party.Dhan Singh Rawat, higher education minister in the Trivendra Singh government said Kaushik will be very good as state BJP president since he has vast experience both within the party and the government. He has severed in various capacities in both party and the state government and his experience will help the party in a major way at this juncture when the elections are round the corner.The appointment of Kaushik, who is MLA from Haridwar in Garhwal region, will also push the party for changes to balance the equation between Kumaon and Garhwal. Bansidhar Bhagat hails from Kumaon. So at this juncture, both state BJP president and chief minister are from Garhwal. This will prompt the party to give more representation in the cabinet formation from the Kumaon region.A senior BJP leader said it is for the first time that the BJP state president is from the plains and not the hill region of the state. “Also, it is likely for the first time that both state BJP president and the chief minister are from the Garhwal region. This will push the party leadership to bring in more changes in the leadership here to strike a balance among castes (Thakur-Brahmin) and region (Garhwal-Kumaon),” he said.On the BJP going for a total overhaul in the state, Devendra Bhasin, state BJP spokesperson said he welcomed the changes being brought in by the party as they are meant for the betterment of the party in the state. “We are having elections here soon and these changes have been brought about to strengthen the party and make sure that the party wins in the 2022 elections in a big way,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2-days-after-cm-was-replaced-bjp-changes-uttarakhand-unit-chief-101615577937768.html
13-03-2021||India||Zoos on forest land to be considered ‘forestry activity’; experts flag concerns||The Union environment ministry’s forest advisory committee has decided that zoos on forest land will be deemed as “forestry” activity, according to minutes of the panel’s February 17 meeting published on the Parivesh website on Thursday.The proposal was placed before a technical committee of the Central Zoo Authority on July 30, 2020, which gave its nod and got subsequent approval from Prakash Javadekar, Union environment minister and chairperson of the authority. “Ex-situ conservation measures are taken in zoological parks. So, of course they should be considered to be forestry activity. We have lots of zoos in forest areas, many more may come up. There are talks in the ministry to amend the FC (forest conservation) Act to relax certain provisions, but no call has been taken yet,” a senior official of the forest conservation division said on condition of anonymity.Wildlife experts said this will mean a boom in safari rides in wildlife-rich areas and a high footfall in ecologically sensitive forest land. HT reported on Friday that the FAC (forest advisory committee) eased norms for ecotourism projects by allowing “non-permanent” structures in protected areas without permission from the central government. These decisions are part of the larger goal of the ministry to ease provisions under the Forest Conservation Act, 1980.During discussions in the ministry, it was debated whether zoo, rescue/rehabilitation and captive breeding facilities be treated as a forestry activity and provisions of the Act should apply. Construction of zoos on forest land, however, has diversified components including public utility facilities that have since been treated as non-forestry activity.“The FAC members reviewed this issue in great detail in the present meeting and opined that all these public utility facilities are necessary for catering to broad objective of raising of awareness and people’s participation in wildlife conservation and for wildlife education,” the minutes state.It was further decided that “the FAC concurred with the facts highlighted by the CZA (Central Zoo Authority) that considering zoos as a non-forestry activity has added multiple/overlapping layers of permissions to be procured under different agencies. Such multiple regulations hamper the spirit of conservation enshrined in the FCA 1980, which permits work relating or ancillary to conservation, development and management of forests and wildlife. Therefore, the FAC recommended that establishment of zoos over forest area... should not be considered as a non-forestry activity.”Under the Wildlife Conservation Act, a zoo is defined as an establishment -- stationary or mobile -- where captive animals are kept for exhibition to the public but does not include a circus and an establishment of a licensed dealer in captive animals. Around 15% of land in a zoo is used for parking, cafeteria and other utilities.“This directive will make declaration of big cat safaris (large enclosures) inside Protected Areas much simpler. This seems to have been done to mitigate human-large carnivore conflict, as large cats involved in conflict could be captured and released in such safaris (enclosures). These safaris can also subsequently help raise funds for the forest department by introducing regulated tourism," said Anish Andheria, President of Wildlife Conservation Trust. He cautioned on the tourism aspect of the decision and also on the ministry's policy to facilitate ecotourism in forest areas. "Unless 'Ecotourism' is first defined unambiguously, relaxing these two clauses (clauses that said ecotourism is a non-forestry activity) will result in huge damage to natural ecosystems. The current Ecotourism models are far from eco-friendly. Even obvious non-negotiables such as usage of renewable energy; installation of waste management facilities, and sharing of majority of profits with local communities are not being enforced. To dilute the guidelines further may be a death knell for forested landscapes,” said Andheria.He cautioned against the tourism aspect and the facilitation of ecotourism. “Unless ‘ecotourism’ is first defined unambiguously, relaxing these two clauses (on ecotourism being a non-forestry activity) will result in huge damage to natural ecosystems.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/zoos-on-forest-land-to-be-considered-forestry-activity-experts-flag-concerns-101615577631120.html
13-03-2021||India||Kerala High Court rejects govt’s plea to withdraw assembly violence case||In a setback to the ruling Left Democratic Front (LDF) in the midst of assembly elections, the Kerala High Court on Friday rejected the government’s plea to withdraw the cases relating to the violence in the state assembly in 2015 in which two ministers and four former legislators of the ruling front are accused.Rejecting the plea the single judge bench of Justice V J Arun said the case involving lawmakers, that too in the house, can’t be justified and directed all accused to face the law. Opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala has also filed a plea asking the court not to withdraw the case saying it will set a bad precedent. A government spokesperson said it will be challenged in the Supreme Court.The House had witnessed ruckus in March 2015 after opposition LDF legislators prevented then Finance Minister K M Mani from presenting the state budget. Angry members snapped mikes, destroyed furniture and damaged lights in the melee and two legislators were later hospitalized.The session was live when violent incidents unfolded and later Speaker N Sakthan had filed a police complaint against six LDF legislators, two of them E P Jayarajan and K T Jaleel are ministers in the Pinarayi Vijayan cabinet now. The complaint said properties worth ₹2.5 lakh were damaged in the melee and they tried to manhandle treasury bench members. Interestingly, after K M Mani’s death his son took the party, Kerala Congress (Mani), to the LDF camp.Earlier the government had invoked the privilege of the house to justify its decision to withdraw the case but the CJM court in Thiruvananthapuram had rejected it saying privilege was not a licence to carry out violent activities. During a discussion in the assembly last year Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan had said assembly proceedings should not be dragged to courts and later the government moved the HC but it refused to entertain its plea. Among six facing charges, two are seeking re-election this time, K T Jaleel and V Sivankutty.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-high-court-rejects-govt-s-plea-to-withdraw-assembly-violence-case-101615577137923.html
13-03-2021||India||SC seeks govt’s response to plea over CBI chief||The Supreme Court on Friday sought the response of the central government on a petition seeking appointment of a regular Director for the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI).NGO Common Cause approached the top court with a public interest litigation to question the Centre’s decision to appoint an interim chief for the agency, Pravin Sinha. The plea, argued by advocate Prashant Bhushan pointed out there was no concept in law of appointing an interim or acting director under the Delhi Special Police Establishment (DSPE) Act, which applies to the central agency.According to Section 4A of the Act, the government is required to convene a meeting of the High Powered Committee chaired by the Prime Minister and comprising the leader of the single largest Opposition party and the Chief Justice of India or his nominee. This panel has to recommend the name of a suitable candidate as director following which the recommendation is approved by the Appointments Committee of the Cabinet. The Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT) finally issues the order appointing the CBI director. This procedure was bypassed after the previous director Rishi Kumar Shukla demitted office on February 2 this year, the petition alleged.A bench of Justices L Nageswara Rao and S Ravindra Bhat issued notice and gave the Centre two weeks to file a response. Meanwhile, Bhushan urged for direction to convene the meeting of the High Powered Committee under Section 4A of the Act. “Not only has the independence of CBI been eroded with the appointment of an interim Director but even the work of the agency has been affected.” he said. But the bench refused to pass any interim orders. “We will first hear them and then pass any orders,” they said.In the petition, the NGO said: “The Director of CBI is the final authority in the organization. He supervises all the work in CBI and is responsible for constitution of investigating teams for probing cases. Hence, this Court and later even Parliament have made determined efforts to enhance the functional autonomy of the CBI Director and limit the extent of executive discretion in the matter of appointment of this key functionary.”In 2016 too, the appointment of an interim director of CBI was challenged before SC by Common Cause. “Now again the same issue has cropped up which has to be dealt with utmost seriousness in view of the sheer power that vests with the important office of a CBI Director,” the petition stated, adding: “The manifest unwillingness of the government to institute a transparent and accountable system to ensure that the culprits are punished seriously impairs the right of the people to live in a corruption and crime free society which violates Articles 14 (right to equality) and 21 (right to life and liberty)...”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/scseeks-govt-s-response-to-plea-over-cbi-chief-101615576639045.html
13-03-2021||India||Quad makes its first big move: Joint vaccine push||The maiden Quad Summit on Friday unveiled an ambitious partnership to pool resources and capabilities of the four members to roll out a billion doses of Covid-19 vaccines by 2022, and created three working groups in the critical areas of new technologies and the climate crisis to give a formal structure to the group.The virtual summit convened by US President Joe Biden and joined by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison and Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga, reviewed common challenges across the Indo-Pacific – especially China’s assertive actions – and the Quad committed itself to promoting a free and open rules-based order to advance security and prosperity and to counter threats in the region and beyond.Also Read | ‘United by democratic values’: PM Modi at historic first Quad leaders' summitFor the Quad Vaccine Partnership, the countries agreed to pool their financial resources, manufacturing capacities and logistical strengths to ramp up the manufacture and distribution of Covid-19 vaccines across the Indo-Pacific.“Our agenda today, covering areas like vaccines, climate change and emerging technologies, make the Quad a force for global good,” Prime Minister Modi said in his opening remarks. “I see this positive vision as an extension of India’s ancient philosophy of Vasudeva Kutumbhakum, which regards the world as one family,” he added.“Today’s summit meeting shows that the Quad has come of age. It will now remain an important pillar of stability in the region,” he said, as the four countries came together for a summit just about 18 months after the Quad was upgraded to the level of foreign ministers.The Quad leaders also agreed to hold an in-person meeting this year, either on the margins of the G7 Summit in UK in June or in one of the four countries, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity.The Quad Summit was the first plurilateral engagement for Biden since he assumed office in January, and he said a free and open Indo-Pacific was essential to the future of all four countries. He added that the Quad was renewing its commitment to “ensure that our region is governed by international law, committed to upholding universal values and free from coercion”.The US president was accompanied at the virtual summit by Vice-President Kamala Harris, Secretary of State Antony Blinken, National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan and Covid-19 response coordinator Jeff Zients.Also Read: Quad vaccine initiative 'landmark partnership' of 4 countries, tweets PM Modi“We’ve got a big agenda ahead of us gentlemen as you well know, but I’m optimistic about our prospects,” Biden said, adding, “The Quad is going to be vital in our cooperation in the Indo-Pacific and I look forward to looking closely to working with all of you in the coming years.”Though none of the four leaders named China in their remarks, and foreign secretary Harsh Shringla played up the “positive agenda” focused on vaccines and climate change, the shadow of China’s assertive and aggressive actions hung large over the meeting and even played a key role in hastening plans for holding the summit, the people added.India’s military standoff with China along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) came up when the leaders discussed regional issues and the other members had a “sympathetic view” towards New Delhi on the matter, said one of the people cited above.Shringla told a news briefing: “As far as India is concerned, we have always said the Quad does not stand against something, it stands for something...which is positive, it stands for doing something in the realm of consideration for others.”All the leaders shared Modi’s vision of a world that looks after its people by pooling capabilities, he said. “That should put to rest any speculation about Quad’s activities directed against any states or others. Quad is an organisation that is working towards a very positive agenda,” he added.The vaccine initiative will create additional manufacturing capacities in India and build on New Delhi’s Vaccine Maitri initiative that has already supplied close to 60 million doses to some 70 countries without affecting domestic production and rollout.“President Biden has worked hard to bring these leaders together to make a clear statement of the importance of the Indo Pacific region,” a senior US official said, reasserting US/Biden ownership of the summit.“I do believe that this (the vaccine initiative) is an historic deliverable. It’s unprecedented, it’s complex, it’s deeply strategically significant, and it is timely,” said another Biden administration official, adding, “it’s hard to do these things and the fact that the Quad has rallied and engaged deeply essentially around the clock, over the course of the last few weeks to do this in a manner which allowed the president to host the summit”.Vaccines developed by the US will be manufactured in India, the world’s largest producer of vaccines, and financing will be provided by the US Development Finance Corporation (DFC), Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), Japan Bank of International Cooperation (JBIC) and others.The DFC will work with India’s Biological E Ltd to finance increased capacity to support efforts to produce at least a billion doses of Covid-19 vaccines by the end of 2022 with Stringent Regulatory Authorization (SRA) and the WHO’s Emergency Use Listing (EUL), including the Johnson & Johnson vaccine.Australia will contribute to overcome last mile and logistical delivery issues and also help countries in Southeast Asia, the Indian Ocean and the Pacific Islands receiving the vaccines, including financing worth $77 million for cold chains, training and building capacity for effective use of the doses. Japan will also help vaccination programmes of developing countries through a grant of $41 million and concessional loans.The partnership will work with the COVAX facility, WHO, Gavi, Asean and G7 for vaccine distribution, Shringla said. The Quad believes this partnership will also create capabilities to prepare for any future pandemics, he said.The Quad leaders agreed on creating three working groups that will for the first time give the loose grouping a more formal structure to deal with common challenges across the Indo-Pacific.The Quad vaccine experts group, comprising top scientists and officials, will design an implementation plan for the vaccine partnership. The Quad climate working group will work to strengthen implementation of the Paris Agreement and strengthen climate actions globally for mitigation, adaptation, resilience, and climate finance. The Quad critical and emerging technology working group will facilitate cooperation on international standards and innovative future technologies, and their safe and judicious use.The technology group will coordinate on standards development and cooperate on issues such as 5G, including telecommunications deployment, diversification of equipment suppliers and future telecommunications.The Biden administration is touting the summit as another evidence of America reversing President Donald Trump’s America First approach that alienated allies and partners and won no favours with the country’s new and old rivals, China and Russia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/quad-makes-its-first-big-move-joint-vaccine-push-101615574498256.html
13-03-2021||India||Jagan seeks Bharat Ratna for Tricolour’s designer||Hyderabad Andhra Pradesh chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy on Friday appealed to the Centre to confer Bharat Ratna, the highest civilian award of the country, on Pingali Venkaiah, a prominent freedom fighter from the state who designed the Indian national tricolour.In a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the YSRCP president said conferring the award on Venkaiah posthumously would be a matter of prestige for every Indian on the occasion of the country’s 75th Independence Day next year.Jagan visited the freedom fighter’s residence at Macherla in Guntur district and felicitated his daughter Ghantasala Seetha Mahalakshmi and other family members. He also garlanded a portrait of Venkaiah and announced a financial assistance of ₹75 lakh for Mahalakshmi. A government order has already been issued in this regard. While appreciating Modi’s decision to hold ‘Azadi ki Amrut Mahotsav’ programme, Jagan recalled that during the first meeting of the national committee on March 8, ‘Har Ghar Jhanda’ (flag in every household) was selected as one of the key themes for the celebration.“A call will be given to every citizen to hoist the national flag in their house on August 15 next year as part of the festivities. In this context, I would like to draw your attention towards the immense contribution made by Pingali Venkaiah in designing the Indian national flag,” the letter read. The freedom fighter, also known as Jhanda Venkaiah, was born on August 2, 1876 in Bhatlapenumarru village near Machalipatnam and was deeply influenced by Gandhian thoughts and ideology, Reddy said. “He worked on various designs of the national flag and on March 31, 1921, in Vijayawada, he gifted them to Mahatma Gandhi who mentioned Venkaiah’s efforts in his journal Young India,” he added. The chief minister said Venkaiah’s design of the tricolor was adopted as the national flag of India by the Constituent Assembly on July 22, 1947.“Thus, Venkaiah was credited as the architect or designer of the Indian national flag. The flag designed by him came to be synonymous with the spirit of free and independent India. However, his life and works largely remain unrecognized. He breathed his last on July 4, 1963,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jagan-seeks-bharat-ratna-for-tricolour-s-designer-101615574200288.html
13-03-2021||India||PM Modi flags off symbolic ‘Dandi March’ of freedom||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday likened the historic Dandi March to the slogan of “Aatmanirbhar Bharat”, and said that if the salt yatra was an assertion of India’s resolve for self-reliance, so is the country’s new push in that direction.The PM also flagged off a symbolic 386-kilometre-long Dandi March from the precincts of the Sabarmati Ashram on the 91st anniversary of the historic protest, and launched the celebration of 75 years of independence “Azadi ka Amrit Mahotsav”, which will go on for 75 weeks until August 15, 2022, India’s 75th Independence Day.The event was held amid allegations by the Congress that its Gujarat leaders were detained to prevent them from holding a parallel Dandi Yatra at the same time.Referring to the salt march that was started on this day by Mahatma Gandhi in 1930 as a springboard to the Civil Disobedience movement in opposition to a salt tax imposed in India by the British, Modi said: “Salt was a symbol of India’s self-reliance, since that time the people had to depend on salt coming from England. Gandhiji understood this and caught the pulse of the people. Soon, the movement became a movement of every Indian.”The PM linked the Aatmanirbhar Bharat campaign with the manufacture and export of made-in-India Covid-19 vaccines, and said the country had demonstrated its increasing self-reliance and was showing a way to the world.“The achievements of India are not only our own today, but they are going to show light to the whole world,” he said.Modi was addressing a public meeting near Abhay Ghat, the resting place of late prime minister Morarji Desai. Earlier, he visited the Sabarmati Ashram, where he paid tribute to Mahatma Gandhi.Paying tribute to Gandhi and other freedom fighters, the PM said: “I bow to the feet of all the great personalities who participated in India’s freedom struggle and have led the country.”Referring to his government’s efforts, Modi said the country had been making relentless efforts for the last six years to restore the glory of India’s history, and said such a push was being given in every state.As an instance, Modi said the country completed the revival of the site associated with the Dandi March two years ago. “I myself had the opportunity to visit Dandi on this occasion,” he said.The event was held in the backdrop of the Congress being denied permission to take out a “tractor yatra to Dandi” and allegations that the police either put several opposition MLAs under house arrest, detained them, or deflated tyres of the 80-odd tractors which were to partake in the rally.Leader of Opposition Paresh Dhanani said: “For six full days, they kept our application for the yatra hanging fire and then since late last (Thursday) night until this afternoon, our MLAs and leaders were kept under house arrest and many were detained by the police. The police took away tractors lying at the Congress headquarters and at many places the tyres were deflated to ensure we didn’t implement our plan.”For such an event, “A permission should not have been required at all. Gandhi fought the British, we are fighting another version now,” Dhanani said.When contacted, minister of state for home Pradeepsinh Jadeja said, “Yes, we refused permission because the Congress was trying to politicise the event by trying to link it with the ongoing farmers’ agitation. It is unfortunate that despite such a drubbing given by the people of Gujarat, the party is not learning its lessons.”He said, “We would have given permission if it was for a Dandi yatra. We are speaking of 75 years of Independence, and not of your (Congress) party.”Ghanshyam Shah, a Gujarat-based political scientist, said, “The entire Dandi yatra was a symbol of civil disobedience and if people want to take out a protest yatra in whatever form, it is the spirit of what Gandhiji said and meant. It is not about Congress or any other political party, it is about the people’s right. This is like ‘people’s politics versus my politics’.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-flags-off-symbolic-dandi-march-of-freedom-101615573997569.html

However, the newly formed entity is still working out the modalities to get the money.With a robust order book and its offer of niche services, NSIL looks to capitalise on demand for launch of commercial satellites among other services to increase revenues.The company has four dedicated launches lined up for the next couple of years and most of its revenues earned so far have been through services, Durairaj said.“We have contracts for four more dedicated launches but our NDAs (non-disclosure agreements) prevent us from revealing more details. All are foreign satellites,” Durairaj said.The company, however, has concerns in the ride-share category which has several other global players.“We were quite competitive commercially until recently. But now many international players have slashed their prices quite substantially. NSIL is not facing any major challenges but it (international players) is still quite a threat for us (NSIL),” he said.Global companies like Elon Musk-owned SpaceX are also in the market for commercial launches of private satellites for various applications like communications, broadband, DTH, GPS and earth monitoring among other uses.However, the company said that it continues to have an edge over others in the higher payload categories or dedicated missions of under 1000 kgs where the client bears the entire cost of the launch. On February 28, Isro launched Amazonia-I and 18 co-passenger satellites from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Sriharikota in Andhra Pradesh, which was the first dedicated commercial mission of the NSIL.The space agency has already executed four PSLV missions for 45 auxiliary commercial satellites, apart from Amazonia-I.“NSIL has established itself as a major space service provider in a very short period and in the not so distant future, you will see it emerging as a key player in all areas of space sector and space-based services in India with a significant global presence,” NSIL Chairman and Managing Director G Narayanan said.According to Isro, Amazonia-I is an optical earth observation satellite of the National Institute for Space Research (INPE) and would strengthen the existing structure by providing remote sensing data to users for monitoring deforestation in the Amazon region and analysis of diversified agriculture across the Brazilian territory.The 18 co-passenger satellites onboard the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV)-C51, considered the workhorse of the space agency, included four from IN-SPACe and 14 from NSIL. Only one of the 14 commercial satellites was from India while the remaining 13 were from the USA. Isro has put 342 customer satellites from 34 countries into orbit so far.The company has also floated RFPs (request for proposals) to five Indian companies or consortia to build PSLV launch vehicles but Durairaj said that there will be no transfer of technology to these firms and that it will only be through licensed production.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/isros-commercial-arm-to-scale-up-ops-with-10k-cr-investment-in-five-years-101615573900565.html

Goyal added that they will also take care of the legal cost of the delivery person Kamaraj, who denied the charges and said it was he who was attacked by the woman. “Right from the get-go, our topmost priority has been to get to the truth. Towards that, we are helping both Hitesha and Kamaraj (our delivery partner) with all the support they need while the investigation is pending. We are also assisting the police in whichever way asked. We are in constant touch with Hitesha, covering her medical expenses, and helping her with the proceedings,” Goyal said in a statement posted on Twitter. “We are also in constant touch with Kamaraj, extending all possible support to make sure both sides of the story come to light and that due process is followed in the spirit of fairness,” the statement added. Goyal added that as per protocol, Zomato has temporarily suspended Kamaraj from making active deliveries, while covering his earnings in the interim. “Also, for the record, Kamaraj has made 5,000 deliveries for us so far and has a 4.75/5-star rating on our platform (which is one of the highest) and has been working with us for 26 months now (these are facts, not opinions, or inferences),” read the statement. On Wednesday, Bengaluru-based content creator Hitesha Chandranee posted a video on social media alleging that the Zomato delivery person assaulted her following an argument over a delay in delivery. She claimed that Kamaraj barged into her house, verbally abused her and punched her in her face. On the same day, Electronic City Police registered a case under Indian Penal Code sections 325 (Punishment for voluntarily causing grievous hurt) and 504 (Intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace) against Kamaraj. He was subsequently arrested but let off on bail the same day. On Thursday, Kamaraj claimed that contrary to the woman’s claim, it was he who was attacked. “As she was hitting me, I tried to block using my hands. When she tried to push my hand away, a ring on her finger hit her nose,” he said. Police officials said statements of both parties were being recorded and further investigation in the case was on.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/zomato-to-cover-medical-bills-of-woman-legal-cost-of-accused-delivery-person-101615573899981.html

Now, we also need to raise out issues on the floor of the House and corner the BJP over people’s issues,” a senior Rajya Sabha strategist of the Congress said on Friday on the condition of anonymity.Opposition parties are likely to meet informally on Monday morning and prepare a joint strategy on how to utilise the debates on the demand for grants and the Finance Bill to underline the alleged mismanagement by the government of various sectors of the economy.Prime Minister Narendra Modi will make a statement on Monday to commemorate celebrations of the country’s 75 years of Independence. He was scheduled to speak on March 12 but deferred the plan due to a lack of consensus between the ruling dispensation and opposition parties.Opposition parties disrupted both Houses of Parliament for three consecutive days over fuel price hikes and the three contentious farm laws before proceedings were adjourned till Monday.After negotiations with the opposition failed, parliamentary affairs minister Pralhad Joshi said: “PM Modi wanted to make a statement in the House on the 75 years of Independence celebrations, ‘Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav’. But due to a lack of consensus, the statement will not be made. It will happen when a consensus is reached.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-stormy-start-house-may-function-next-week-101615573541530.html
13-03-2021||India||‘Normal’ monsoon likely for 3rd year in row, say experts||India has received normal monsoon for two straight years, aiding a farm-driven economic recovery in a pandemic year. Sufficient June-to-September rains will be critical this year, but data show three consecutive normal monsoons are rare, occurring only once in the past two decades.Scientists say current conditions suggest they should favour a normal 2021 monsoon, the lifeblood of Asia’s third-largest economy. As the country tries to claw out of a recession, patchy rains may weigh on recovery, analysts say.The monsoon is critical because two-thirds of Indians depend on farm-based income and over 40% of the country’s net-sown cropped area does not have any form of irrigation.Millions of farmers wait for the rains to begin summer sowing of crops, such as rice, sugar, cotton, pulses, horticulture produce and coarse cereals.Agriculture, which contributes 39% to the rural economy, was able to shake off the impacts of the coronavirus pandemic because of normal rains and ample supplies of subsidised inputs, such a fertilisers, during the pandemic. The sector also benefited from fiscal support from the rural job guarantee scheme MGNREGA and PM Kisan, a cash-transfer programme for farmers.Throughout the peak pandemic months, the farm sector was the only bright spot in the Indian economy. It grew 3.4% in the June 2020 quarter, when rest of the economy fell deep into recession of -24.4% due to a widespread lockdown.Growth returned to positive territory in the December 2020 quarter, the latest available data, expanding 0.4%. Agriculture grew at 3.9% in the same period, compared to 3% in the previous quarter.To be sure, the Reserve Bank of India and the official Economic Survey have forecast the economy to grow 10.5% and 11% respectively in the next fiscal, after a nearly 8% negative growth this fiscal.Much depends on how the monsoon pans out. “After two consecutive years of normal monsoon, a third year of timely and well-distributed rains is not a given,” said DK Joshi, chief economist of Crisil Ltd, ratings firm.The monsoon also replenishes 89 nationally important water reservoirs vital for drinking, power and irrigation. When rains lead to robust farm output, rural incomes rise and spending goes up on almost everything – television sets to gold.For example, 48% of all motorcycles and 44% of TV sets are sold in rural India. Without this demand, industrial growth tends to slow down. Normal rains act as a strong check on inflation through plentiful food stocks.The long-range forecast division of the India Meteorological Department is currently preparing to forecast the monsoon next month. “The indications (about the monsoon) are good. We have our fingers crossed,” an agriculture department official said.The Indian monsoon usually ends up short when oceans temperatures in the Pacific are higher than normal, a weather pattern known as El Nino. The opposite happens, and rains are plentiful, when oceans are cooler, known meteorologically as La Nina. Both 2019 and 2020 fell in the latter category.The monsoon also depends on what Met scientists call the Indian Ocean Dipole, which refers to the difference in sea-surface temperatures in two opposite parts of the Indian Ocean.Scientists watching the monsoon say, till now, there aren’t signs of oceans warming. “The Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) (was) solidly in La Nina range in February, but down from January and peak in December. Downward trend of SOI continued in early March as ENSO marches toward neutral,” said Jason Nicholls, international forecasting manager at AccuWeather, a weather forecasting firm.ENSO refers to a recurring weather pattern that influences ocean temperatures.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/normal-monsoon-likely-for-3rd-year-in-row-say-experts-101615573539873.html
13-03-2021||India||No clotting case in India after Oxford dose: Officials||No cases of adverse event involving blood clots have been reported in India in the case of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, according to top officials involved in the country’s coronavirus inoculation campaign, who also said a deeper review of post-vaccination side effects will be carried out next week.The announcement came after several countries halted the roll-out of the AZD1222 vaccine, which is separately being administered in India as Covishield (the version made by Serum Institute of India). AstraZeneca, the World Health Organization (WHO) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) have said the shot is safe to use.Also Read: Britons told to keep getting vaccinated after some countries suspend AstraZeneca shotsNonetheless, India will review adverse events following immunisation (AEFI) data from across the country for any reports of blood clots or similar adverse reaction. “The review is taking place as a matter of abundant precaution, even though India so far has not reported any cases of clotting related damage that is in medical terms called thromboembolic phenomenon. It has been reported in a Scandinavian country, but we have decided to scrutinise India data very carefully,” said Dr NK Arora, member of the national task force on Covid-19 vaccination’s committee on AEFI.“The health ministry will be providing raw AEFI data from across the country for next week’s review,” he added.Union ministry of health and family welfare held a separate meeting with nodal officers of AEFI committees at the state level on Friday, to collate updated data on adverse events reported from across the country.After reports of blood clots and one death from Denmark, eight other countries—Norway, Iceland, Austria, Estonia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Italy, and Latvia— also temporarily suspended use of AZD1222 as a precautionary measure.The EMA said that it is reviewing the matter and has not established a link between vaccination and these clotting events.“The Covid Task Force has been asked to look into the issue, but for them to review the matter they need raw data that we will provide. Though there has been no case of blood clots reported so far in the country, we are finding out if anything similar has been reported from anywhere in the country in individuals who have been administered the vaccines,” said Rajesh Bhushan, secretary, Union health ministry.The meeting will continue on Saturday, and the date for national committee meeting will be decided based on the outcome of Saturday’s meeting.The central and state governments have been conducting AEFI surveillance at multiple levels. There is an AEFI expert committee in place at the district, state and national level. The health ministry is collating AEFI data from the state AEFI committee nodal officers.“Broadly speaking there are two types of adverse events post vaccination: mild and those that cause death or hospitalization. It is the latter that is of concern to us, and we want to be doubly sure that this is not happening in our country,” said Dr Arora.“It will be an entirely independent review that will involve high-level experts from the field. It will also be a rolling kind of a review so that we analyse real-time data. All deaths and hospitalizations post Covid-19 vaccinations will be reviewed in great detail,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-clotting-case-in-india-after-oxford-dose-101615573479974.html
13-03-2021||India||HC rejects Kerala govt’s plea to drop assembly ruckus case||In a setback to the ruling Left Democratic Front (LDF) ahead of the April 6 assembly elections, the Kerala high court on Friday rejected the Pinarayi Vijayan government’s plea to withdraw a criminal caserelating to the violence in the state assembly in 2015 during the previous Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF) regime.Two ministers from the present state cabinet and four former legislators are accused in the case.Rejecting the plea, a single bench of Justice V J Arun said withdrawing the case involving thebehavior of the lawmakersin the House cannot be justified and directed all the accused to face legal proceedings.Opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala has filed a plea, urging the court not to withdraw the case to avoid setting a bad precedent.The high court’s move will be challenged in the Supreme Court, a government spokesperson said.In March 2015, the House witnessed a ruckus after then opposition LDF legislators prevented finance minister K M Mani, who was facing charges in a bribery case, from presenting the state budget. The members snapped mikes, destroyed furniture and damaged lights in the melee that ensued. Two legislators were later hospitalised.The session was live when the violent incidents unfolded, prompting the then speaker N Sakthan to file a police complaint against six LDF legislators, including E P Jayarajan and K T Jaleel who are serving as industries minister and education minister, respectively, in the present Vijayan cabinet.In his complaint, the speaker said property worth ₹2.5 lakh was damaged and also accused the legislators of trying to manhandle the members of the treasury bench. The case was filed under Prevention of Destruction of Public Property Act and sections 447 (criminal trespass) and 427 (mischief causing damage) of the Indian Penal Code.Interestingly, after Mani’s death in 2019, his son took the party, Kerala Congress (Mani), to the LDF camp.Earlier, the present state government invoked the privilege of the house to justify its decision to withdraw the case but the court of the Chief Judicial Magistrate in Thiruvanthapuram rejected this on grounds that privilege did not serve as a license to carry out violent activities.During a discussion in the Assembly last year, Vijayan had said that assembly proceedings should not be dragged to the courts. The government later moved the high court which refused to entertain the plea.Among the six legislators facing the case, K T Jaleel and V Sivankutty are seeking re-election this time from Thavanoor and Nemom, respectively.K Ajith, C K Sadasivan and K Kunhammed are the remaining former legislators accused in the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hc-rejects-kerala-govt-s-plea-to-drop-assembly-ruckus-case-101615573359428.html
13-03-2021||India||2 years after violent stir, will CAA issue sway Assam polls?||With elections to the Assam assembly due next month, the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, or CAA -- a controversial legislation that seeks to grant citizenship to religious minorities from Muslim-majority Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan who entered India on or before December 31, 2014 -- is in focus again.Violent protests had rocked the state for several days in December 2019 against CAA, claiming the lives of five in police firing, and the clamour against the legislation led to the birth of two regional parties. While the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party-led coalition is downplaying CAA and its impact (the legislation is yet to be implemented), the opposition alliance led by the Congress is raking it up again.Fear of outsidersThe genesis to the opposition to the legislation lies in indigenous communities in Assam being apprehensive of outsiders, especially those from Bangladesh (erstwhile East Pakistan) for over a century. This sentiment led to an agitation between 1979 and 1985, which claimed over 800 lives in police action and ended with signing of an accord that promised sealing of borders with Bangladesh and the detection and deportation of illegal immigrants who entered after March 24, 1971.Successive governments failed to implement the accord and the illegal Bangladeshi immigrants issue continued to simmer. Five years ago, when the BJP promised to deport all illegal Bangladeshis, it galvanised voters, and the party was able to come to power for the first time along with alliance partners Asom Gana Parishad (AGP) and Bodoland Peoples Front (BPF).So when the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) introduced and passed CAA in Parliament in December 2019, protests flared up across most parts of Assam, fearing that it would lead to the influx of more “outsiders”. There were protests in other parts of India as well, but while those protests were against the exclusion of Muslims from its the law’s purview, in Assam opposition was against allowing non-Muslim illegal immigrants to become citizens.Protesters said the CAA provisions was against the 1985 Assam Accord that assured an end to entry of illegal immigrants irrespective of their religious affiliations. Several groups and indigenous associations contended that if CAA is implemented, it could lead to an influx of illegal immigrants from Bangladesh and threaten language, culture and land holdings of local populations.New regional parties opposed to CAA Though the protests against CAA died down after few days, they resulted in formation of two regional parties opposed to the legislation. The All Assam Students Union (AASU) and Assam Jatiyatabadi Yuva Chatra Parishad (AJYCP), two prominent student bodies that spearheaded the protests, formed Assam Jatiya Parishad. And another outfit, Raijor Dal, was launched by Krishak Mukti Sangram Samiti (KMSS), a farmers’ rights body that also played a key role in the anti-CAA stir.Claiming to be unadulterated representatives of indigenous aspirations, these two parties have joined hands to form the third alternative for voters while trying to remain equidistant from the BJP-led ruling alliance and the Congress-led Opposition.“Once we come to power, our government will take a decision on non-implementation of CAA in Assam, pass a resolution in assembly on it and intensify protests to get the legislation scrapped in parliament,” Raijor Dal’s working president said on Tuesday after releasing the party’s “vision document”.The AJP has released a list of candidates for 68 (out of 126) seats till now, Raijor Dal has announced candidates for 20 seats. President of AJP Lurinjyoti Gogoi will contest from Duliajan and Naharkatiya and Raijor Dal chief Akhil Gogoi, who is under arrest since December 2019 for his role in the anti-CAA protests, will be contesting from the Sivasagar and Mariani seats. The alliance has a tie-up with Autonomous State Demand Committee (ASDC) for the seats in two hills districts of Karbi Anglong and Dima Hasao.Congress’s standThe two new regional outfits are not alone in their opposition to CAA. The “grand alliance” of Congress and six other parties — All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF), BPF, CPI, CPI-M, CPI-ML and newly formed Anchalik Gana Morcha (AGM) are also raising the legislation as a key poll issue.The Congress’s stance on CAA was displayed loud and clear during party leader Rahul Gandhi’s first poll rally in the state last month at Sivasagar, where all senior leaders wore “gamosas” (traditional towels) around their necks with a struck-through CAA written on it. Gandhi said that CAA was the BJP’s attempt at dividing the people of Assam, and the Congress will now allow its implementation in Assam if the party comes to power.The anti-CAA stance is also part of Congress’s five guarantees for voters in this election. The party has also announced plans to build a memorial on the anti-CAA protests after coming to power. “After we win the election, we will pass a law in the assembly that won’t allow the CAA to be implemented in Assam. We have already asked lawyers to start drafting such a law,” Congress Lok Sabha MP from Nagaon Pradyut Bordoloi said.BJP unperturbedThe BJP and its allies, however, are confident (at least publicly) that CAA is a non-issue in this election, and the ruling coalition’s development and welfare schemes in the past five years will be enough to ensure another term.“Protests against CAA have lost relevance post the Covid-19 pandemic. Voters are not bothered about it now. They are more concerned about development. The Congress and other parties have failed to judge the sentiment of the public,” senior minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said recently.Instead of mentioning CAA in their poll rallies, the party is playing the religion card. Sarma has stressed that there is a threat to Assamese people and their religion and culture from Muslims who came from Bangladesh. He and his party colleagues also highlight how Congress has acted against the interest of people of Assam by joining hands with Badruddin Ajmal’s AIUDF, a party they describe as communal.“Our stand on CAA has been very clear and implementing it is part of BJP’s ideology. Despite that, people of Assam have supported us in 2016 assembly polls and the 2019 general election. It won’t affect us this time as well. In fact, people are more worried about the unholy nexus between Congress and AIUDF and will show them the door again,” BJP spokesperson Rupam Goswami said.Limited impactExperts say that the CAA issue have a limited impact on the polls.“CAA should and could have been an important poll issue in Assam. But the spontaneous protests against the legislation erupted like a volcano in December 2019 and petered out. Even the two political parties, Assam Jatiya Parishad and Raijor Dal, which were formed as an outcome of the protests, failed to carry forward or sustain the issue,” said Alaka Sarmah, professor of political science at Gauhati University.“The legislation may play on mind of a section of voters in urban areas who are more aware of the issue, but it won’t affect how people vote in the rural areas, which is substantial, as they are aloof or not aware enough about CAA. On the other hand, the welfare schemes of the present government targeting almost all sections could play a bigger role. At least that’s the mood at the moment,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2-yrs-after-violent-stir-will-caa-issue-sway-assam-polls-101615573239916.html
13-03-2021||India||At her farewell, Justice Indu Malhotra chokes with emotion during speech||upreme Court justice Indu Malhotra, the first woman member of the Bar to be directly appointed as a judge in the top court, could not hold back the tears during her farewell speech on Friday, prompting Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde to cut in.On her last working day in the apex court, justice Malhotra sat on the bench with the CJI, in accordance with the convention in the top court. Attorney general KK Venugopal, leaders of the Bar, and some other senior lawyers, were present before the bench to bid adieu to her.Justice Malhotra began her final address by saying that she felt blessed to have served as a judge in the Supreme Court, but was soon overcome by emotions. At this point, the CJI took over to conclude the ceremonial proceedings. “I expect her to complete her speech on some other occasion,” CJI Bobde said.CJI Bobde recounted an episode when justice Malhotra was a lawyer and had argued before his bench.“She was arguing in a matter and she wouldn’t stop arguing. I asked my colleague on the bench that we have already understood her points. So, why is she still arguing? I was told that she prepares everything so well that she wouldn’t stop before telling everything,” quipped the CJI.Justice Bobde shared another personal anecdote when his daughter, lawyer Rukmini Bobde, had opined about an issue, something which he later heard from justice Malhotra in the court.“My daughter used to often appear with her (justice Malhotra) when she was a lawyer. It was long before I came to this court. One day during our discussion, my daughter came up with a peculiar reason. I listened to her. These days you don’t question anyone but only listen. I also did the same. When we both were judges in this court, one day, justice Malhotra shared the same opinion with me about what my daughter was talking about. I realised what a good role model she is. My daughter was making the same argument she (justice Malhotra) was making,” he said. The CJI did not mention the subject though.The attorney general began by calling it a “great pity” that excellent judges in the apex court had to retire so quickly. “She could have worked here at least for 10 more years. It is very unfortunate that the judges in this court have to retire at 65,” said the A-G, adding judges must continue at least till the age of 70.Venugopal also recalled how justice Malhotra was the sole woman judge who dissented from her four male colleagues while deciding the Sabarimala case. Four judges on the SC bench decided in favour of allowing women of all ages to enter the shrine in Kerala but justice Malhotra differed, saying courts should not interfere with the matters of faith until the practices are inherently unconstitutional.The A-G commended her for “the integrity she showed as a woman judge” in delivering the Sabarimala judgment, and concluded by saying: “We are losing a great judge.”Senior advocate Vikas Singh, president of the Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA), said that justice Malhotra had been an inspiration for the young members of the Bar, especially for women lawyers. “It (advocacy) has been one of those professions which hasn’t been very kind to the women members. But justice Malhotra has motivated so many young women lawyers as she became the first woman member of the Bar to be directly appointed as a judge in the Supreme Court,” said Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/at-her-farewell-justice-indu-malhotra-chokes-with-emotion-during-speech-101615544913631.html
