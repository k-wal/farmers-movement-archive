Indian Air power grows further," the Indian Embassy in France tweeted earlier.With the arrival of the three jets, the size of the Rafale fleet has increased to 14.The first batch of five Rafale jets arrived in India on July 29, nearly four years after India signed an inter-governmental agreement with France to procure 36 of the aircraft at a cost of ₹59,000 crore.The formal induction ceremony of the fleet had taken place at Ambala on September 10 last.A second batch of three Rafale jets arrived in India on November 3, while a third batch of another three jets joined the IAF on January 27.The first Rafale squadron is based in Ambala air force station.The Indian Air Force is set to raise the second squadron of the Rafale combat jets in mid-April and it will be based in Hasimara air base in West Bengal, according to military officials.India is expected to get more Rafale jets from France in the next few months.The Rafale jets, manufactured by French aerospace major Dassault Aviation, are India's first major acquisition of fighter planes in 23 years after the Sukhoi jets were imported from Russia.The Rafale jets are capable of carrying a range of potent weapons. European missile maker MBDA's Meteor beyond visual range air-to-air missile, Scalp cruise missile and MICA weapons system will be the mainstay of the weapons package of the Rafale jets.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/3-more-rafales-land-in-india-iaf-thanks-uae-for-mid-air-refueling-101617214561574.html
31-03-2021||India||SC-appointed panel submits recommendations to court||The three-member expert panel constituted by the Supreme Court to study and recommend changes to the Centre’s three new farm laws has submitted its report, one of the members of the panel said.The top court is likely to take up the matter next week after the Holi vacation.“The Committee submitted its report to the Supreme Court on March 19 in a sealed cover. The report is based on the issues referred to it for consideration as per the January 12 order passed by the Supreme Court. We have given our recommendations. Now it is entirely up to the Supreme Court to act on our recommendations,” said panel member Anil Ghanwat. Ghanwat is the president of the Maharashtra-based farmer organization Shetkari Sanghatana.Thousands of farmers have been camping at Delhi’s borders since November last year, seeking a repeal of the new farm laws, which they say will erode their bargaining power, weaken a system of assured prices, and leave them vulnerable to exploitation by agri-businesses. The government has maintained that the laws aim to ease restrictions on farm trade by setting up free markets, allow traders to stockpile large stocks of food for future sales and lay down a framework for contract farming.A three-judge bench of the top court, headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde, appointed the committee on January 12 for the evaluation of the new laws and stayed their implementation after several rounds of negotiations between protesting farmers and the government failed to break the impasse.“The negotiations between the farmers’ bodies and the Government have not yielded any result so far. Therefore, we are of the view that the constitution of a committee of experts in the field of agriculture to negotiate between the farmers’ bodies and the Government of India may create a congenial atmosphere and improve the trust and confidence of the farmers. We are also of the view that a stay of implementation of all the three farm laws for the present, may assuage the hurt feelings of the farmers and encourage them to come to the negotiating table with confidence and good faith,” the court order said.The committee was asked to submit its report within two months. It held 12 rounds of discussions with farmer groups, farmer producer organisations of FPOs, intermediaries, academicians, experts, and private sector as well as state-owed agriculture companies. The committee was originally constituted with Bhupinder Singh Mann (National President, BKU and All India Kisan Coordination Committee), Pramod Kumar Joshi (Agricultural Economist, Director for South Asia, International Food Policy Research Institute), Ashok Gulati (Agricultural Economist and Former Chairman of the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices) and Ghanwat. Mann, however, resigned two days later expressing solidarity with the protesting farmer unions.Farm unions were quick to reject the panel, and it is not clear whether they will accept the recommendations. “We are not concerned about the Supreme Court committee’s report. We have already said that its members are pro-government. Our only demand is a withdrawal of the three laws,” said Gurnam Singh Charuni, a core member of the Samyukt Kisan Morcha, a platform of farm unions leading an ongoing agitation against the farm laws.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/scappointed-panel-submits-recommendations-to-court-101617213892805.html

On the front of testing, Punjab and Chandigarh were asked to effectively implement the "test, track and treat" strategy and to escalate testing till the positivity comes down below 5 per cent.They were asked to significantly increase testing in all districts with a minimum of 70 per cent RT-PCR tests and use of Rapid Antigen Tests as screening tests in densely populated areas as well as areas where cluster of cases are reported and mandatorily subject those who have tested negative in Rapid Antigen Test (RAT) to RT-PCR test, the ministry said."Regarding the vaccination, the state/UT were advised to ensure priority vaccination of the eligible population groups in districts reporting higher cases."Transfer unused vaccine doses from one district to another for optimum utilization of available vaccine doses," it said.They were asked to ensure no sedimentation of vaccine takes place at any level of cold chain storage, maximum utilisation of vaccination capacity in the public and private sector health facilities."There is no shortage of vaccination at the State/UT level. The Centre is regularly reviewing vaccine stock, and vaccine doses will be continually replenished by the Centre based on the consumption level of the states and UTs," the statement said.Regarding surveillance and containment, Punjab and Chandigarh were also advised that all district officers and the local administration should refocus on effective house-to-house surveillance to identify active cases with focus on timely testing, prompt contact tracing and swift isolation so as to break the chain of transmission.They were asked to identify clusters, focus stringent implementation of micro-containment zone approach.The Principal Secretaries (Health) of Punjab and Chandigarh along with deputy commissioners of the highly affected districts such as Amritsar, Ludhiana, SBS Nagar and Jalandhar shared their feedback on the activities being undertaken in the districts to break the chain of transmission, preparation of hospital infrastructure, clinical treatment protocols in hospitals to reduce mortality, and awareness campaigns.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-centre-tells-punjab-to-effectively-implement-test-track-treat-strategy-101617210751072.html

My wife is at home alone. They have not allowed anybody to see anything”.It was not clear if Krishna’s premises were also being searched by the agency. Prabhakar is currently in jail after he was arrested by the Andhra Pradesh police a few weeks ago.A NIA officer, who didn’t want to be named, said most of the 64 accused named in the FIR are being raided to collect evidence of their involvement in the conspiracy.This officer added that the agency wants to unearth the entire ‘Urban-Naxals’ network.The latest case was registered by Andhra Pradesh police on November 23 last year after the arrest of a TV journalist from Visakhapatnam, Pangi Naganna (30). It is alleged that Naganna worked as a courier for Maoists and had been passing information to the ultras inside the jungle about police movement and as instructed by Maoist leaders he was involved in instigating villagers to stop the forces from combing operations, obstruct police from entering villages, revolt against police parties and hold rallies against the government. Revolutionary Maoist literature, press notes, medicines, wire bundles and other incriminating material was said to have been recovered from his bag at the time of arrest.During his interrogation, Naganna said he facilitated meetings between Maoists and civil society organisations.It was on the basis of Naganna’s confession that the state police had named VS Krishna as well as Akkiraju Haragopal – a senior Central Committee member of the CPI (Maoist). The state police had further alleged that Krishna had assured Haragopal of spreading Maoist ideology in urban areas. Haragopal too is named as an accused in NIA case.It is further alleged that Chilika Chandrasekhar also met Maoists, according to Naganna’s confession.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nia-raids-activists-in-andhra-telangana-for-alleged-maoist-links-101617210233225.html
31-03-2021||India||'SOS call', 'confession of defeat': What BJP leaders said on Mamata's letter||A day before West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee's assembly constituency Nandigram goes to the elections, a letter written by Mamata Banerjee urging several non-BJP leaders to be united against the BJP intensified political heat as BJP leaders considered the letter as a desperate call to be saved. In the letter, written on March 28, Mamata wrote the BJP wants to make it "impossible for non-BJP parties to exercise their Constitutional rights and freedoms". "It wants to dilute the powers of State Governments and downgrade them to mere municipalities. In short, it wants to establish a ONE-PARTY AUTHORITARIAN RULE in India," the letter said.Saying that everyone has a right to unite, BJP chief JP Nadda said the call to unite against BJP, however, signals something else. "In a democracy, everybody has the right to unite those who share a similar ideology. But at this time, to ask everyone to unite against PM Modi and the BJP shows clear indication in elections. There's a saying in English 'Save Our Souls (SOS) or Save Our Ship (SOS)'. It means their ship is sinking. It is clear now that Mamataji has admitted that her ship is sinking in Bengal and she is in trouble and people of Bengal have decided to give an overwhelming verdict to the BJP," Nadda said.Democracy shd be the last word in @MamataOfficial & @AITCofficial dictionary . Their cadre attack @BJP4Bengal candidates , intimidate voters , capture booths , block all hoardings & at the end leaders preach Democracy . https://t.co/DZt2os31Ld"Democracy should be the last word in @MamataOfficial & @AITCofficial dictionary.

At least 17 legislators from the coalition had defected and helped Yediyurappa to power after weeks and months of drama in the southern state.Recently, the Karnataka CM has been at the receiving end of dissent from within his own party and is also the target of opposition attacks. The developments come at a time when Yediyurappa already finds himself in a corner over the recent sex-scandal involving Ramesh Jarkiholi, non-performance of his two-year-old government, cash crunch and growing calls for his removal among other problems. His second son, BY Vijayendra, is also accused of running a parallel administration and the chief minister is allegedly favouring a few ministers and legislators loyal to him, antagonising core-party MLAs and others.The three bypolls on April 17 in Karnataka had presented the 78-year-old with an opportunity to silence growing dissent and consolidate his position for the remainder of the two years in power. Yediyurappa has also taken it upon himself to bring the BJP back to power in 2023 on its own steam.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/more-trouble-for-cm-yediyurappa-as-cabinet-minister-accuses-him-of-being-authoritarian-101617209213016.html

The price of different brands of English liquor has been increased by 15 to 20 per cent.There is no change in the excise duty and license fee of beer, but its prices are being reduced to increase the consumption of beer in Uttar Pradesh.The sale of beer was badly affected due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The sale at beer shops from April 2020 to November 2020 has been only 17.28 crore bottles in the state against 27.08 crore bottles last year, which is approximately 36 per cent less.Therefore, the government has decided not to change the annual license fee of retail shops of beer.As per the Excise Policy for the year 2020-21, the maximum retail price (MRP) of beer is higher than neighbouring states of Uttar Pradesh like Delhi, Haryana and Punjab. The price of beer is also higher than those states which are prone to smuggling. Additionally, the yield charge on beer is higher than that of foreign wines, depending on the alcohol content.The increase in license fees by seven and a half per cent is the main reason behind this increase in the prices of domestic and English liquor from April 1.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/beer-to-be-cheaper-indian-english-liquor-price-to-rise-in-up-from-april-1-101617204245567.html

On Monday, the state reported 31,643 new infections and 102 deaths in 24 hours.

In March, the price was again hiked to ₹819.In Kolkata, a cylinder costs ₹ ₹845 while in Mumbai and Chennai, the prices are ₹819 and ₹835, respectively.While petrol and diesel prices have already been cut thrice in one week, cooking gas (LPG) price too will see a reduction in the near future, the official, who did not want to be identified, said.A drop in all the prices of petrol, diesel and LPG was being expected as international oil prices have softened, news agency PTI reported quoting a top official. "International oil prices, which are the benchmark for deciding retail rates, have softened over the past few days. Though there had been some firming up of prices on Tuesday, overall the trend has been of a decline, which should reflect in domestic retail rates as well," he said.The issue of petrol, diesel, LPG gas hike has become a political one amid the ongoing assembly election season as opposition parties accused the Centre of doing nothing to rein in the price hike. The Centre, however, said the price depends on the international markets and also the taxes imposed by state governments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lpg-to-be-cheaper-by-rs-10-per-cylinder-from-april-1-101617197124092.html

The farmers’ union has said that besides farmers and labourers, women, dalit-adivasi-bahujans, unemployed youth and representatives of every section of the society will participate in the march. The body has assured that the march, in protest of the three contentious farm laws, will be completely peaceful.The agitating farmers will come from their villages to the borders of Delhi through their vehicles, after which they will ‘paidal march’ or march on foot from the borders of the national capital. The exact date of the march towards Parliament will be announced in the coming days, news agency ANI quoted the umbrella body as saying.Also Read | Domestic LPG to be cheaper by ₹10 per cylinder from April 1The farmers’ leaders have also planned to form a committee to control the agitators in case there is police action during the march to avoid any unforeseen event as was witnessed on the Republic day.“We will form a committee to let the protesters know what to do in case there is police action during the march.,” Gurnaam Singh Chaduni told news agency PTI. “It will also be made clear to them that SKM condemns all kinds of violence. So the protestors will know that if there is any damage of property by them, they will have to serve the penalty," he added.The farmers leaders on Wednesday also announced multiple plans for the summer to protest the laws until they are repealed, including blocking the Kundli-Manesar-Palwal expressway for a day, beginning from 11am, on April 10.The leaders said an event to honour the lives of those who died during the agitation will also be organised on May 6, including separate events to commemorate Labour Day on May 1 and Ambedkar Jayanti scheduled for April 14.“We will be doing this because the government has not been listening to us. It has been sleeping. This is to wake up the government,” PTI quoted another leader as saying.Also Read | Are you taking a flight in April?

31-03-2021||India||NIA probe in Mansukh Hiran’s murder confirms ‘smothering’ as cause of death||The National Investigation Agency’s initial findings in the murder of businessman Manuskh Hiran reveal that he was smothered to death before being thrown into the Thane Creek, which is consistent with the probe of the Maharashtra Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS), people familiar with the development said.“Several handkerchiefs had been stuffed into Hiran’s mouth and it appears his face had been covered ‘tightly’ with another big cloth, due to which he could not breathe. There was some struggle but seems he had been adequately overpowered,” said an officer who didn’t want to be named.The agency, however, doesn’t want to conclude anything yet till an official opinion is given by the team of medical experts, who are currently examining the post mortem report along with other evidence.The post mortem conducted on March 5 stated that Hiran’s “mouth was closed, tongue within mouth” and “foul smelling blood tinged fluid oozing from nostrils”. It added that there was ‘abrasion over the face on the left side at zygomatic area; abrasion over left nostril, upper part; abrasion over right side cheek along ramus of mandible up to chin on right side and abrasion over face 1 cm lateral to outer canthus of right eye”.Hiran’s body had been recovered from the creek along the Mumbra-Reti-Bunder Road on March 5.NIA investigations, about the motive of the murder, have so far revealed that arrested Mumbai police officer Sachin Vaze decided to kill Hiran after the latter refused to take the blame for planting the explosive-laden vehicle outside the residence of industrialist Mukesh Ambani on February 25, as first reported by HT.The agency is also sure that Vaze was physically present at the murder scene, which is suspected to be Gaumukh Chowpatty, when Hiran was killed but it is gathering more evidence regarding his whereabouts at that time. Apart from Vaze, co-accused -- Naresh Gour (a bookie) and Vinayak Shinde (a convicted Constable) and several officers of CIU (Crime Intelligence Unit) are being interrogated on this aspect but they have been giving contradictory statements, which need further verification, according to the second officer.The systematic destruction of evidence after Hiran’s murder was in “panic”, according to the first officer, as ATS had taken over the murder investigation and NIA was knocking at the door.The central agency had taken over the Antilia bomb scare probe on March 8 and arrested Vaze on March 13. It has been found that Vaze made the whole plan to restore his lost credibility by solving a sensational case in record time and prove his worth to the Mumbai police brass, as exclusively reported by HT.“We are not rushing the probe. It’s clear that Vaze is the main conspirator in both the incidents. Those who helped him in Antilia explosive planting and then murder of Hiran are almost identified but we don’t want to jump to any conclusion till we have joined every loose end. We will unearth the entire conspiracy very soon,” said a third officer.NIA also wants to make sure if the whole CIU (Crime Intelligence Unit), which was then headed by Vaze, was aware of the plan to murder Hiran.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nia-probe-in-mansukh-hiran-s-murder-confirms-smothering-as-cause-of-death-101617195054930.html

In a high-level meeting to review preparations a day before vaccinations are being opened up for those 45 years of age and above, the ministry also directed the states to identify low vaccine coverage pockets, particularly in districts showing Covid-19 surge, and to take corrective measures.“Maintain vaccine wastage at less than 1% (present National Wastage Percentage being 6%). Regularly review vaccine wastage across all levels to minimise the same. Ensure timely utilisation of available stocks to avoid expiry of vaccines without usage. Timely updating of data of vaccine consumption to be ensured on CoWIN & eVIN portals,” the health ministry directed all the states.Union health secretary, Rajesh Bhushan, and RS Sharma, chairperson, empowered group on Covid vaccination, held the online meeting with health secretaries, state mission directors of National Health Mission, and state immunisation officers of all states and Union Territories to review the status, pace and issues regarding Covid vaccination across the country as well as the preparations for April 1, 2021.Also Read | Over 84% of India’s daily Covid-19 cases reported from 8 statesFor vaccinating healthcare and frontline workers, the states were asked to ensure that only eligible beneficiaries are registered and vaccinated under the category; archive incorrect entries or duplications on the Co-WIN; identify pockets of low vaccination coverage at health facility, professional associations, blocks and districts to take corrective action; and ensure saturation of vaccination of these groups on priority. The Centre assured states that there was no shortage of vaccines and no problem in storage and logistics of vaccines, and that it will continually replenish the stocks based on consumption trends.“…there is no value in conserving vaccines for the second dose and that states must promptly supply vaccines to all government and private hospitals where there is a demand,” Sharma told states.On the issue of vaccine stocks, the states were advised to ensure that there was no sedimentation of vaccine stocks at any level of storage; distribution was based on consumption to avoid overstocking as well as under-stocking at cold chain points and Covid vaccination centres (CVCs); and regular review of vaccine stocks and consumption is undertaken to identify gap areas and address the same.The health secretary reiterated the need for involving the private sector in Covid-19 vaccine delivery in a big way. As of now, only 6,271 vaccination centres are in the private sector out of 47,441 total centres offering Covid-19 vaccination across the country.Also Read | WHO team urges patience after first look for origin of coronavirusBhushan asked states to conduct regular reviews of vaccinations at private Covid Vaccination Centres with respect to their capacity utilisation; undertake geographic information system (GIS) analysis of vaccination centres to identify need for additional vaccination centres within states and Union Territories; and also to proactively address apprehensions of private Covid Vaccination Centres regarding vaccine supply, guidelines etc.India started its Covid-19 vaccination coverage on January 16, 2021, and has administered at least 63 million Covid-19 vaccine doses to date. Close to 50,000 beneficiaries above 60 years of age, and 7,000 beneficiaries above 45 years with co-morbidities, have so far been fully vaccinated in the country.Experts say immunising everyone will be the key to control the spread of infection.“Ultimately, we will need to get everyone, including children, immunised,” said Dr Gagandeep Kang, one of country’s top vaccinologist.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-holds-review-meet-with-states-uts-ahead-of-45-plus-covid-vaccination-101617193132524.html

31-03-2021||India||‘Unite against BJP’: Mamata writes to Sonia, Uddhav, Kejriwal, others||West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee, in a letter to several non-Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders, accused it of trying to establish a “one-party authoritarian rule” in India, calling for a plan of action to be formulated against the BJP after the conclusion of the ongoing assembly elections.The three-page letter, dated March 28, was addressed to more than a dozen non-BJP leaders, including Congress president Sonia Gandhi, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar, Shiv sena supremo and Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) convenor and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, Rashtriya Janata Dal’s (RJD) Tejashwi Yadav, Samajwadi Party (SP) chief Akhilesh Yadav, Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) president MK Stalin, among others.Banerjee accused the BJP and its government at the Centre of “attacking democracy and constitutional federalism in India,” citing the recently-passed Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi (GNCTD) Bill as an example. “With this law, the Lieutenant Governor Delhi has been made the undeclared Viceroy of Delhi, acting as a proxy for the home minister and the prime minister. The government has snatched away practically all the powers of the democratically elected government of Delhi,” the Trinamool Congress (TMC) chief, known for her frequent face-offs with the BJP and the central government, wrote.She cited six other instances to highlight her point: "Governors functioning as BJP office bearers, use of investigating agencies against opposition parties and governments, withholding transfer of funds to non-BJP states, disbanding of the National Development Council, Inter-state Council, Planning Commission; amassing of unlimited resources by the BJP to topple non-BJP governments, and the Central government's reckless policies of privatisation of national assets."The Centre-state relations, and those between the ruling party at the Centre and the Opposition parties, have never been this bad in the history of India, Banerjee further wrote, remarking that the blame for this rests squarely with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's "authoritarian conduct.""Therefore, I strongly believe that the time has come for a strong and effective struggle against the BJP's attacks on democracy and Constitution, promising to work wholeheartedly with all similar-minded parties against the BJP," she added.The West Bengal chief minister concluded the letter stating that the battle can only be won by "presenting a credible alternative to the people of Indi||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/unite-against-bjp-mamata-writes-to-sonia-uddhav-kejriwal-others-101617186716586.html
31-03-2021||India||Supreme Court-appointed panel submits report on farm laws||The three-member expert committee formed by the Supreme Court to study the three farm laws passed by the Parliament and recommend changes has submitted its report to the apex court in a sealed cover. The court, which is currently closed due to Holi recess, is expected to take up the matter next week on reopening.Confirming the development, one of the expert members in the committee, Anil Ghanwat, said, “The committee has submitted its report to the Supreme Court on March 19 in a sealed cover. The report is based on the issues referred to it for consideration as per the January 12 order passed by the Supreme Court. We have given our recommendations. Now it is entirely up to the Supreme Court to act on our recommendations.” Ghanwat is also the president of the Maharashtra-based farmer organisation, Shetkari Sanghatana. At the heart of the dispute are the three farm laws -- Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020 and Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020. The laws were cleared by the Parliament and came into operation after receiving Presidential assent in September last year.The committee was originally constituted with Bhupinder Singh Mann (then national president, Bhartiya Kisan Union (Mann), and All India Kisan Coordination Committee), Pramod Kumar Joshi (agricultural economist, director for South Asia, International Food Policy Research Institute), Ashok Gulati, (agricultural economist and former chairman of the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices), and Anil Ghanwat. Two days later, Mann resigned expressing solidarity with the cause of the farmer unions opposed to the laws. Also Read | Modernisation need of hour in farm sector: PMPrior to January 12 when the committee was formed, several rounds of negotiations between the government and farmer unions ended in a deadlock with many farmer unions intensifying their stir at Delhi borders and demanding repeal of the laws. To break the impasse, a three-judge bench of the top court headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde formed the committee and stayed the implementation of the three laws. The order said, “The negotiations between the farmers’ bodies and the Government have not yielded any result so far. Therefore, we are of the view that the constitution of a committee of experts in the field of agriculture to negotiate between the farmers’ bodies and the Government of India may create a congenial atmosphere and improve the trust and confidence of the farmers. We are also of the view that a stay of implementation of all the three farm laws for the present, may assuage the hurt feelings of the farmers and encourage them to come to the negotiating table with confidence and good faith.”The court had directed the committee to submit its report in two months. Since its constitution, the committee received several suggestions and met farmer unions. Meanwhile, one of the farmer unions – Bhartiya Kisan Union (Bhanu) – approached the top court seeking removal of the three members alleging bias against them. The application filed by the union attached news clippings of the committee members openly expressing their support for the farm laws.On January 20, the court ruled out bias against the members of the committee and hit out against aspersions being cast on them based on their views on the subject. The bench led by CJI Bobde said, “We have serious objections on people whom we have appointed being called names and that this court has interest in selecting them. We will decide on the constitutionality of the laws, but we will not expose the members whom we appointed to such maligning based on public opinion decided by majority.” On bias, the court held, “Where is the question of bias when the committee is not given any power to adjudicate. We have asked them to hear the grievances of farmers and give us a report.”Also Read | Rahul Gandhi says government wants to ‘snatch’ farmers’ future via farm lawsSeveral petitions are pending before the Supreme Court on the constitutional validity of the three farm laws. One set of petitions has demanded scrapping of the three laws on the ground that they “surreptitiously” repeal similar laws passed by states which interferes with the state’s law-making power without an effective amendment to the Constitution. At the same time, another set of petitions in the top court supports the legislations as being beneficial for farmers.Among those who have challenged the farm laws include members of Parliament - Tiruchi Siva from Tamil Nadu’s Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) and Manoj Kumar Jha from Bihar’s Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), lawyer Manohar Lal Sharma, and farmers/farmer unions – Bhartiya Kisan Party, farmer from Madhya Pradesh DP Dhakad, Chhattisgarh Kisan Congress vice president Rakesh Vaishnav and P Ayyakannu, state president of National South Indian River Interlinking Agriculturist Sangam.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-appointed-panel-submits-report-on-farm-laws-101617185872857.html

Assuring that there is no shortage of vaccines, Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan asked states to identify areas where vaccine coverage has been low so far and take "corrective actions" there.The health secretary held a video-conference with health secretaries and immunisation officers of all states and UTs to review the status, pace and several issues regarding the ongoing vaccination drive as from tomorrow vaccination will be not be limited to only senior citizens or those with co-morbidities. The Centre also asked states to review the vaccination of health care workers and front line workers done so far.Over 84% of India's daily Covid-19 cases reported from 8 statesOn the inoculation of health care workers and frontline workers, the Centre asked states to archive incorrect or duplicate entries on Co-WIN platform, to identify low vaccine coverage areas and to finally ensure that vaccination of these two priority groups can be wrapped up.Vaccine wastage was also addressed at Wednesday's meeting where the Centre asked the states to maintain vaccine wastage below 1 per cent, while the present national wastage percentage is 6. States and UTs have been asked to regularly review vaccine wastage across all levels.National Health Authority CEO RS Sharma, who was also present at the video conference, said states should promptly supply vaccines to hospitals according to their demand, instead of conserving vaccines for the second dose.As of Wednesday 7am, over 6 crore vaccine doses have been administered in India, which includes health care, frontline workers and people above the age of 45 years with comorbidities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-keep-vaccine-wastage-below-1-centre-asks-statesuts-101617183462074.html
31-03-2021||India||French warships arrive in Indian waters for joint exercise with Quad navies||Two French warships are making a port call at Kochi ahead of the La Pérouse joint naval exercise, which will see France leading manoeuvres in the Bay of Bengal that will involve the navies of the four members of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue or Quad. The Tonnerre, an amphibious assault helicopter carrier, and the Surcouf, a La Fayette-class frigate, will be in Kochi till April 1, and then sail to the Bay of Bengal for the joint exercise that will last from April 5 to 7. This is the first time the French Navy is conducting a joint drill with all four members of the Quad – India, Australia, Japan and the US – in regional waters, and the wargame comes weeks after the maiden Quad Leaders Summit on March 12. The drills will be followed by two crucial trilateral meetings between the foreign ministers of India and Australia and their counterparts from France and Indonesia, to be held on the margins of the Raisina Dialogue in New Delhi next month. Also Read | ‘Will hold ground in Ladakh for as long as needed’: Gen Naravane on standoffThe Tonnerre and the Surcouf form the battle group Jeanne d’Arc, which left France in February for a five-month deployment in the Indo-Pacific to demonstrate France’s capacity to deploy assets in strategic areas and to strengthen interoperability with major partners in the region, particularly India, the French embassy said in a statement on Wednesday. The deployment will also help train a new batch of 148 French naval officer cadets. French ambassador Emmanuel Lenain, who was in Kochi to welcome the two warships, said: “I am proud of the exceptional level of trust and interoperability that our navies have achieved. It is no surprise that India and the Indo-Pacific are at the heart of the training for the new generation of French Navy officers.” The La Pérouse exercise will be “a concrete demonstration of multilateralism at sea and our commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific”, Lenain said. After the joint exercise, the two French warships will continue their deployment across the Indo-Pacific and sail to Japan, before returning to France in mid-July. During their voyage, the warships will sail through the South China Sea twice. China is locked in maritime disputes with several countries in the South China Sea and the members of the Quad have backed efforts to ensure freedom of navigation and overflight in these waters. The first edition of the La Pérouse joint exercise, initiated by France in 2019, included warships from Australia, Japan and the US. This year, India is joining the wargame for the first time. Describing India as France’s “foremost strategic partner in Asia”, the French embassy’s statement said the “large-scale five-country naval exercise...will provide an opportunity for these five like-minded, high-end naval forces to develop closer links, sharpen their skills, and promote maritime cooperation throughout a free and open Indo-Pacific”. Varuna, the joint naval exercise by France and India, was first conducted in 1983 and it has grown steadily, especially in the past few years. In 2018, during French President Emmanuel Macron’s visit to India, the two sides signed an agreement that enables reciprocal logistics support between their armed forces and provides mutual access to military bases, including naval ports. In the coming weeks, India and France will hold a large-scale Varuna exercise in the Western Arabian Sea that will involve a French aircraft carrier battle group.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/french-warships-arrive-in-indian-waters-for-joint-exercise-with-quad-navies-101617181192220.html
31-03-2021||India||Ishrat Jahan encounter case: CBI court discharges 3 police officers||A special CBI court here on Wednesday discharged police officers G L Singhal, Tarun Barot and Anaju Chaudhary in the 2004 Ishrat Jahan alleged fake encounter case.Special CBI judge V R Raval allowed the discharge applications of Singhal, Barot (now retired) and Chaudhary."The CBI has not mentioned anything specific against the sanction order (in which the Gujarat government declined sanction to prosecute the three accused) which also leads to believe the act of applicants/accused was in discharge of official duties," the court observed.The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on March 20 conveyed to the court that the state government had declined sanction for prosecution of the three accused.The court in its October 2020 order observed that they had "acted in their official duties," so the probe agency was required to obtain sanction for prosecution.Under section 197 of the Criminal Procedure Code, sanction is required for prosecuting government servants for anything done in the discharge of official duty.Ishrat Jahan, a 19-year-old woman from Mumbra near Mumbai, was killed along with Javed Shaikh alias Pranesh Pillai, Amjadali Akbarali Rana and Zeeshan Johar by Gujarat police in an 'encounter' near Ahmedabad on June 15, 2004.The police claimed the four were terrorists who were planning to assassinate the then Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi.However, a high court-appointed Special Investigation Team concluded that the encounter was fake, after which the CBI registered a case against various police officials.Inspector General of Police Singhal, retired police officers Barot and J G Parmar, and Chaudhary had filed applications before the court seeking dropping of proceedings for want of the requisite sanction to prosecute them.Parmar died during the course of hearing in the case.On Wednesday, the judge said when this court earlier observed that the act of the accused was while discharging official duties, nobody challenged the order."Not only that, but the Central Government and the Government of Gujarat have also believed that the act of the applicants/accused is while discharging the duties and therefore, the government was moved for sanction and the sanction is refused also," the court observed.There is nothing on record, even prima facie, to suggest that the victims were not terrorists and the IB inputs were not genuine, the court said in its order."The CBI has not mentioned anything specific against the sanction order which also leads to believe the act of applicants/accused was in discharge of official duties," it said.The court also refused to accept the argument put forth by Special Public Prosecutor for the CBI, R C Kodekar, that the govermnent order declining sanction to prosecute the three applicants was issued without the application of mind.The CBI had named seven police officers - P P Pandey, D G Vanzara, N K Amin, Singhal, Barot, Parmar and Chaudhary -- as accused in its first charge sheet filed in 2013.In 2019, the CBI court dropped proceedings against former police officers Vanzara and Amin, after the state government refused sanction to prosecute them.Earlier, in 2018, former in-charge Director General of Police P P Pandey was discharged from the case.The court on Wednesday discharged Singhal, Chaudhary and Barot from offences under IPC Sections 120-B (criminal conspiracy), 341, 342, 343 (all for wrongful restraint), 365 (kidnapping or abducting with intent secretly and wrongfully to confine person), 368 (wrongfully concealing or keeping in confinement, kidnapped or abducted person), 302 (murder) and 201 (causing disappearance of evidence of offence).They were also discharged under sections 25(1)(e) and 27 of the Indian Arms Act.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ishrat-jahan-encounter-case-cbi-court-discharges-3-police-officers-101617180448410.html
31-03-2021||India||WEF's gender gap index: India slips 28 places, ranks 140 among 156 countries||India has slipped 28 places to rank 140th among 156 countries in the World Economic Forum's Global Gender Gap Report 2021, becoming the third-worst performer in South Asia.According to the report, India has closed 62.5 per cent of its gender gap till date.The country had ranked 112th among 153 countries in the Global Gender Gap Index 2020.Noting that the decline also took place on the economic participation and opportunity subindex, albeit to a lesser extent, the report said India's gender gap on this dimension widened by 3 per cent this year, leading to a 32.6 per cent gap closed till date.Most of the decline occurred on the political empowerment subindex, where India regressed 13.5 percentage points, with a significant decline in the number of women ministers (from 23.1 per cent in 2019 to 9.1 per cent in 2021)."Among the drivers of this decline is a decrease in women's labour force participation rate, which fell from 24.8 per cent to 22.3 per cent. In addition, the share of women in professional and technical roles declined further to 29.2 per cent. The share of women in senior and managerial positions also remains low: only 14.6 per cent of these positions are held by women and there are only 8.9 per cent firms with female top managers," the report said.Further, the estimated earned income of women in India is only one-fifth of men's, which puts the country among the bottom 10 globally on this indicator, it said.Discrimination against women is also reflected in the health and survival subindex statistics. With 93.7 per cent of this gap closed to date, India ranks among the bottom five countries in this subindex.Wide gaps in sex ratio at birth are due to the high incidence of gender-based sex-selective practices. In addition, more than one in four women has faced intimate violence in her lifetime, the report said."Conversely, 96.2 per cent of the educational attainment subindex gender gap has been closed, with parity achieved in primary, secondary and tertiary education. Yet, gender gaps persist in terms of literacy: one third of women are illiterate (34.2 per cent) compared to 17.6 per cent of men," it added.Among India's neighbours, Bangladesh ranked 65, Nepal 106, Pakistan 153, Afghanistan 156, Bhutan 130 and Sri Lanka 116.Among regions, South Asia is the second-lowest performer on the index, with 62.3 per cent of its overall gender gap closed."Within the region, a wide gulf separates the best-performing country, Bangladesh, which has closed 71.9 per cent of its gender gap so far, from Afghanistan, which has only closed 44.4 per cent of its gap."India is the third-worst performer in the region, having closed 62.5 per cent of its gap. Because of its large population, India's performance has a substantial impact on the region's overall performance," the report said.In South Asia, only Pakistan and Afghanistan ranked below India.The report stated that India, home to 0.65 billion women, has widened its gender gap from almost 66.8 per cent one year ago to 62.5 per cent this year.In Pakistan and Afghanistan, the income of an average woman is below 16 per cent of that of an average man, while in India it is 20.7 per cent, it said.As the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic continues to be felt, the global gender gap has increased by a generation from 99.5 years to 135.6 years, the report noted.Now in its 15th year, the report benchmarks the evolution of gender-based gaps in four areas: economic participation and opportunity, educational attainment, health and survival, and political empowerment. It also examines the drivers of gender gaps and outlines the policies and practices needed for a gender-inclusive recovery.For the 12th time, Iceland is the most gender-equal country in the world. The top 10 most gender-equal countries include Finland, Norway, New Zealand, Rwanda, Sweden, Ireland and Switzerland.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/wefs-gender-gap-index-india-slips-28-places-ranks-140-among-156-countries-101617178122495.html

31-03-2021||India||Barauni woman planned father-in-law’s murder to secure job for husband: Police||The government railway police (GRP) in Bihar late Tuesday evening arrested a woman who allegedly planned her father-in-law’s murder in Barauni so that her husband could get his job in the railways.The woman allegedly hired contract killers for ₹2 lakh and paid them ₹90, 000 as advance. Police said that two unidentified assailants barged into the quarter of one Satish Choudhary at South Railway residential colony in Barauni and shot him dead on March 24. Choudhary, who was posted as a technician in an electric powerhouse of the railways, had returned home from duty when he was shot.A murder case was lodged against unidentified criminals on the basis of the statement of deceased’s son. Following the incident, GRP’s superintendent of police Ashok Kumar Singh constituted an SIT to crack the case. The SIT arrested one of the suspects identified as Sakshi Kumari, the daughter-in-law of the victim. On sustained interrogation, she broke down and confessed to the crime. “Everything was well planned, but the accused made some mistake on the basis of which she was nabbed within six days of the incident. During the primary interrogation, the accused confessed that she hatched a conspiracy to eliminate her father-in-law in order to secure a government job for her husband on compensatory grounds if Choudhary died in harness,” said Barauni SHO Mohammad Imran Alam. The SHO said that Sakshi hired contract killers with the help of her boyfriend and offered ₹2 lakh. As per a standing circular issued by the department of personnel and training of the Union government, in case of natural death or accidental death of a government employee during his/her service period, the eldest ward of the deceased government servant will be considered for employment in a job suitable to his qualification in a Class 3 or 4 post. The SHO said raids are on to nab Sakshi’s boyfriend as well as the contract killers. In another case, the Patna police cracked the sensational murder of one Amrendra Kumar (48), schoolteacher of Mahendru middle school by arresting his wife, her paramour and two hired killers on Tuesdy. Amrendra was gunned down on March 19 when he and his wife Pratima Kumari (41), a lawyer in Patna City court, along with their daughter were on way to Daniyawan from Ramkrishna Nagar locality in two separate vehicles to make payment for the purchase of a plot of land.Two assailants on a bike intercepted Amrendra near Shukulpur and shot him from the back. During investigation police found that the assailants could not touch a sum of ₹4 lakh which the victim was carrying. “Police initially started the investigation as insider role in the murder. Acting on a tip-off two persons identified as —Bimlesh Kumar alias Chhotan and Nikhil Kumar Pandey alias Golu (both from Buxar) — were detained for interrogation,” rural SP Kantesh Kumar Mishra said.“During interrogation they revealed that Sunil Kumar Goswami, close relative of Chhotan hired him as a contract killer to eliminate school teacher and offered ₹4 lakh”Goswami, who is also a lawyer, paid ₹50,000 in advance to the killers while Pratima provide location of her husband through Goswami. “Pratima has admitted her involvement, following which, Goswami was arrested. A motorcycle which was used in the crime was recovered and five cell phones were seized from their possession,” the rural SP said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/barauni-woman-planned-father-in-law-s-murder-to-secure-job-for-husband-police-101617172912173.html
31-03-2021||India||Odisha cut 1.85 crore trees to widen roads in 10 years, planted only 29 lakh||The Odisha government on Tuesday said that it has cut over 1.85 crore trees in the last 10 years for widening of roads.Replying to a question of BJP MLA Mohan Majhi in the assembly, on the number of trees felled for widening of roads in Odisha between 2010 and 2020, forest and environment minister Bikram Keshari Arukh said the trees were cut for widening of national highways such as the Sambalpur-Chhatisgarh section of NH-6, four-laning of Bhubaneswar-Puri road, Panikoili-Remuli section and Remuli Rajamunda section.However, just about 29 lakh trees were planted in place of the felled trees at an expenditure of ₹66.17 crore. The total number of trees planted were about 16 per cent of the trees that were cut down. The Ministry of Environment, Forests & Climate Change has authorized the state governments to grant General Approval under Section 2 of Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 for diversion of forest land up to 5 hectare in each case for creation of critical public utility infrastructure by government departments involving felling of trees not exceeding 50 number of trees per hectare in Maoist-affected districts. As per Forest Conservation Act, 1980, for every tree cut on non-forest land for any developmental project, two trees have to be planted while the same for forest lands is 10.Expressing shock over the huge loss of trees due to road widening, environmental activists said the losses are irreversible. “The trees that were felled must be at least 20-30 years old. The trees were not just giving shades to pedestrians, but also sheltered a lot of birds and reptiles. Recouping the losses is a near impossible task. The government may have planted around 30 lakh trees to recoup the losses, but I doubt if more than 5 per cent trees would have survived. The government should have looked at alternatives rather than simply sawing the trees,” said noted environmental activist Hemant Sahu.Last month, while hearing a plea related to the cutting of more than 350 trees for the construction of road over bridges (ROBs) as well as widening of national highway in West Bengal, a Supreme Court bench headed by chief justice SA Bobde had said the top court may introduce a protocol so that there is minimum damage to the environment.Hearing another plea on cutting of trees for a road project in Uttar Pradesh, the Supreme Court in December last year had wondered why trees need to be cut more often than needed for the widening of roads. “Why do roads have to be laid in a straight line by cutting trees? Keep roads zigzag. It will reduce speed, lessen accidents on roads and save many lives,” a bench presided over by chief justice S A Bobde had said.But despite the SC glare on cutting of trees for road widening, several such projects are operational in Odisha. In Ganjam district of Odisha, at least 1,720 fully-grown and old trees of different species will be cut for the widening of a 40 kilometre stretch of the National Highway 59 there. The ₹126-crore project would widen the road to 12 metres from 7 metres between Ratanpur near Berhampur city and Mundamarai near Aska.“Phailin cyclone in 2013 uprooted several trees in Ganjam. But now all roadside trees will be wiped out to widen the road,” said Sudhir Rout, founder of Aryabhatta Foundation, an organisation fighting against tree felling.The large scale felling of trees have taken their toll on the forest cover of the state. As per the FSI-2011 report, Odisha had a forest cover of 58,136 sq km which came down to 51, 619 sq km in FSI-2019 report. The loss of forest cover has happened not just due to road widening, but due to successive natural disasters as well as several industrial projects.Cyclone Phailin, that struck the districts of Ganjam and Khurda in 2013, led to loss of 15400 trees while tree cover in 29 sq km area in reserve forest and protected areas were damaged. Cyclone Fani in 2019 uprooted 22 lakh trees, most of them fruit bearing trees in Puri and Khurda districts.In one of the largest-ever tree-felling exercises for an industrial project in recent times, over 17,000 trees were cut in December 2019 in Sambalpur district. An opencast coal mining project of central government-owned Neyveli Lignite Corporation coming up at Talabira area of Sambalpur district would result in diversion of 1,038.187 hectares of prime forest land, having trees like Sal, Mahul, Asan, Dhaura, Jamun, Mango and Char. By a conservative estimate, at least 1.3 lakh trees would be cut to make way for the Talabira coal blocks.“Talabira coal block would be among the projects in recent times when a large number of trees were cut. In case of highway expansion, the government could plant only 16 per cent of the trees cut and no one knows how many of the saplings survived. Talabira has one of the best Sal forests in Odisha and once 1.3 lakh trees are cut no one knows how many years it will take to regenerate the same tree cover,” said Sankar Pani, environmental lawyer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-cut-1-85-crore-trees-to-widen-roads-in-10-years-planted-only-29-lakh-101617172494818.html

The Centre is also concerned about the second wave of the infection, and has said the situation is turning from bad to worse.But all this seems to have little impact on the people of Delhi. News agency ANI posted a video on Twitter on Wednesday morning, which showed people roaming around in east Delhi's Ghazipur market without following any precautions.The market was brimming with people without masks, the ANI video showed. They were in close contact at the fruits and vegetable shops, at a time when experts have warned that huge gatherings can turn into superspreader events and result in a spike in the number of Covid-19 infections.#WATCH People flout COVID19 safety norms at Gazipur Fruit and Vegetable Market in Delhi pic.twitter.com/igilKCFFSkTraders, who queued up inside, were also seen purchasing products without following the social distancing norms.Ghazipur Mandi is the second-largest wholesale vegetable and fruit market in Delhi.

The high court single judge bench of Justice Dama Seshadri Naidu, ruled that “mere difficulty or post-marriage discord” would not amount to ‘grave lack of discretion of judgment’ at the time of consent but rather it must be a severe or grave mental disturbance or disorder, which represses or severely limits an individual’s cognitive ability.”According to Church Law, also referred to as Canon Law, a marriage can be annulled only on a specific set of reasons -- if both or one of the parties is adjudged to “lack the sufficient use of reason; or suffer from grave lack of discretion of judgment concerning essential matrimonial rights and duties; or who are not capable of assuming the essential obligations of matrimony due to causes of a psychic nature.”In the present case, the husband sought the annulment on grounds that he was suffering from “a grave lack of discretion of judgment” and the marriage needed to be annulled. In Goa, owing to the Portuguese civil code, marriages between Catholics are governed under the Canon (Church) Law and the verdicts passed by the Ecclestical (Church) Tribunals are legally and civilly binding. However, the Bombay High Court at Goa in October 2019 struck down a section of the Portuguse Civil Code which had restricted the powers of the high court to supersede the rulings of the ecclestical tribunals, allowing litigants to now approach the high court with marriage disputes. The case dates back to 2012 when two divorcees, in their mid-40s, Francis and Maria (names changed) were introduced to each other and agreed to get married. Their marriage was solemnised and registered. When they entered this matrimonial bond, they were in their mid-forties. They live happily or normally for a few years. Later, however, there arose certain differences, which, according to the husband, are irreconcilable. So he complained to the Parish Priest, who tried to counsel both the wife and husband; he failed to bring about any reconciliation or rapprochement between them. The husband then applied for annulment in the marriage before the Ecclestical (Church) Tribunal alleging that “in my heart, I did not want to marry in haste without knowing the girl, but the situation forced me to consent to the marriage… [her] talk was so sweet that I was taken up by her and blindly did what she told me to do”. “She tricked and forced me into this marriage. She did not allow me to think or even consult anybody,” he claimed. The tribunal granted the annulment on grounds that the woman suffered from “grave lack of Discretion of Judgment”. The wife then appealed before the Metropolitan Tribunal where her appeal was rejecte. She then approached the high court. “We have seen… what amounts to a ‘grave lack of discretion of judgment concerning essential matrimonial rights and duties which are to be mutually given and accepted’. It must be a severe or grave mental disturbance or disorder, which represses or severely limits an individual’s cognitive ability. That is, the incapacity must be of a psychic or psycho-physical nature. Mere difficulty or post-marriage discord cannot come within the purview of [the relevant section of Canon law],” the high court ruled. The tribunals, in their judgement annulled the marriage on grounds that the marriage was celebrated without sufficient courtship; that the husband was in a confused state of mind when he consented to the marriage; the wife hurried the marriage; the couple contracted the marriage without due preparation as required by the Church Law; the wife prevented the husband from making satisfactory inquiries about her among other reasons. But the High court was not amused. “The reasons the tribunals below have given for allowing the husband to have the marriage annulled simply trivialise a sacrament. Secularly speaking, the decision shocks one’s sense of justice; spiritually speaking, it shocks one’s canonical convictions or conventions,” the high court added. “‘Consent’ is a voluntary act of a person with no cognitive impairment or psychic abnormalities or shortcomings. Not thinking wisely or not thinking leisurely does not vitiate consent,” the High Court ruled. The high court then proceeded to set aside an annulment that the Church tribunal had granted with expressing the hope that it “leads to the parties’ reunion.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mere-discord-not-enough-to-annul-church-marriage-bombay-hc-101617168231686.html
31-03-2021||India||How MGNREGS transformed rural India in an environmentally sustainable manner||To quench the thirst of her cattle, Raina Devi had to chase her cows and goats to a hand pump and pump water for them so each one could get their day’s share of drinking water. This was eight years ago. Such was the water crisis in her village that most villagers couldn’t think of growing wheat or other crops ever.Since women in her village got their Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) job cards, the village and their lives have undergone a dramatic transformation. “Women have found dignity. I did not have money to buy even chillies or salt on my own. Now I have enough money in my bank account to care for my children and household needs. There is enough water for our cattle and a beautiful grazing ground that we have made for them under MGNREGS. We can also comfortably grow food and fodder crops,” says Raina Devi over the phone from Bhawanipura in Rajasthan’s Bhilwara.Also Read | C’garh ranks first in country in terms of providing employment under MGNREGAIn Raina Devi’s village, three water harvesting structures (WHS) have been constructed on the common land for improved water availability. Water availability in around 12 wells near pastures has improved immensely, improving water availability for agriculture and crop diversification, according to assessments by Foundation of Ecological Security which has been working with women there. Around 158 acres of commons are covered under MGNREGS in Bhawanipura which includes digging trenches, making bunds, bori bunds, boundary trench, grass seeding and planting of native tree species such as Desi Babool (Acacia Nilotica), Ber (Ziziphus), Khejdi (Prosopis cineraria), Neem (Azadirachta indica) etc. for improved water, fodder and fuel availability. There are norms for managing restored commons such as monthly meetings of village institutions, rotational grazing, no felling of trees on common land among others.Raina Devi’s story captures how MGNREGS — this is the 15th year of the scheme — has turned around lives, mainly through its natural resource management (NRM) works which includes a large number of waters harvesting structures and soil moisture conservation works. To be sure, the scheme has come under criticism, but it has played a key role in transforming rural India in an environmentally sustainable manner, while providing a safety valve to citizens in distress and in need for work, visible during the pandemic. The nature of MGNREGS workThe MGNREGS Act, which came into force on February 2, 2006, guarantees at least 100 days of guaranteed wage employment in a year to those households whose adult members volunteer to do unskilled manual work.In phase I, it was introduced in the 200 most backward districts in the country, and 130 additional districts in phase II during 2007-08. The remaining districts were covered in phase III after 2008. In 2014, MGNREGA Schedule-I was amended, which mandated that at least 60% expenditure will be on agriculture and allied activities. Consequently, a list of permissible works under the Act now include nearly 75% activities that directly improve water recharge and water conservation efforts. The major works taken up under NRM include check dams, ponds, renovation of traditional water bodies, land development, embankment, field bunds, field channels, plantations, trenches etc. In 2020-21 alone 298,323 water related works worth ₹8,80,917.25 were carried out according to data on MGNREGS website.According to an analysis by the Centre for Science and Environment, based on data from MGNREGA management information system, in the last 15 years, 30 million water conservation-related works; or 50 works/village were taken up. Potentially, these structures conserved 28,741 million cubic metres of water which can fill up, say the entire area of the Udaisagar lake in Udaipur, the analysis said.“We think 100 days’ guaranteed employment is only a limited aspect of MGNREGS, in fact an ornamental one. It is much more than that. We visited 16 villages where MGNREGS was implemented 2006 onwards and saw the transformation ourselves. By law, MGNREGS has to devote 60% of all works to water-related structures. This has helped immensely in countering drought, harvesting water in parched areas, making agriculture and cattle rearing possible and arresting migration of people from these villages. It’s a climate adaptation strategy. The government should study the scheme’s potential carefully,” said Richard Mahapatra at Centre for Science and Environment.The human impact Rukmani Devi of Kundeli village in Rajasthan’s Rajsamand district said each of the 200 women in her village who are engaged in MGNREGS works earn nearly ₹20,000 a year. “It’s not small. For women who couldn’t earn anything, its very significant. But I think we have benefitted more by building common water harvesting structures. For example, because of the grazing ground, we have developed we now keep a large number of cattle. The cattle give us milk which helps support the nutrition of our children. A water source for our cattle was 5km away before these structures were developed. Now there is water available during all seasons in our wells also.” Also Read | ‘Spend every penny under MNREGA for water conservation, supply’: PM ModiAround 350 families are able to grow crops such as wheat, mustard and gram etc after the implementation of MGNREGS here. The scheme also turned out to be a life saviour for many who returned back to their villages during the Covid 19 lockdown.“Many women came to seek help. We helped them get job cards. They have worked with us in building some major structures this year. They will not return to the cities — Mumbai, Surat, Delhi anymore because they can see how MGNREGS can help them sustain here,” said Leela Devi, also from Kundeli.In Bihar, which witnessed the return of around 2.5 million migrants during Covid 19 lockdown last year, MGNREGS helped the state government to provide instant jobs. Principal secretary, rural development department, Arvind Chaudhary said about 2.174 million man days of work were created under MGNREGS this year (2020-21) as compared to 1.427 million man days last year.“During the pandemic, when a large number of migrants were forced back to their villages, programmes like MGNREGS provided critical support through wage employment and helped them cope with the crisis. This, combined with restoration and creation of durable community assets like water harvesting structures and regeneration of grazing lands have contributed to the resilience of local agriculture and livestock production systems, said Sanjay Joshie, Executive Director, Foundation for Ecological Security. He added that the scheme has been crucial in improving the resilience of rural economies and mitigating the impact of climate crisis. HT visited Kokdakhar, a village in Chhattisgarh’s Kabirdhan district in 2019, where farmers were bracing for their crops to fail for the second year in a row because of an erratic monsoon. The only resource that was helping them tide over monsoon vagaries was a large earthen dam, 4.5m deep and 62m long, that the villagers particularly tribal women toiled for months to build. The dam captures the flow from ridge to valley, stores water and arrests erosion.Tiharo Bai, who was among the 1,100 people who has built the dam, farm ponds and check dams under MGNREGS, said the assets had become life savers. “We got some money under the 100 days scheme when there was no work. We also got water to survive the drought. There are only three hand pumps, everything else has run dry,” said Tiharo Bai, who belongs to the Baiga tribe.Returning to where it all beganBandlapalli, a sleepy village in Andhra Pradesh’s Anantapuramu district hit national headlines on February 2, 2006, when the then Prime Minister, Manmohan Singh launched the MGNREGS here.Bandlapalli, with a population of 2,560 people, was perennially drought-affected and witnessed distress migration of labourers due to lack of sufficient water to raise any crops. But, one-and-a-half decades later, Bandlapalli has become a role model for others in implementing water conservation schemes, thanks to MGNREGS.According to the project director of Anantapuramu District Water Management Agency, N Venugopal Reddy, MGNREGS has transformed the lifestyle of the villagers who used to migrate to long distances in search of livelihood. “Distress migration has halted. Every eligible person was given the job card and works were taken up for creation of water storage infrastructure to store runaway water from hill slopes,” he said. The government took up construction of “staggered trenches” with a gap of three to four metres between two trenches, which served as a sort of watersheds to capture water from the streams passing through the hill slopes. These water ponds have not only improved the groundwater table to a large extent, but also helped development of greenery that retained moisture. The villages were able to raise horticulture crops and regular crops like maize, Bengal gram and green gram. The groundwater table in the village has increased substantially by 12.6 metres. “Now, there is a perennial water source in the village,” Reddy said. According to official figures, in the last 15 years, as many as 517,000 man days of work were created in Bandlapalli, and an amount of ₹9.33 crore was spent on MGNREGS works, including ₹7.92 crore towards the wage component. As many as 2,128 households were provided 100 days wage employment during this period.The place where India’s most ambitious rural employment scheme began 15 years ago is, today, reaping the dividends of this avatar of India’s welfare state.

We have started implementing it from March 16," CPRO of Western Railway, Sumit Thakur, told PTI.Southern Railway CPRO B Guganesan told PTI that these instructions are not new, but a reiteration of earlier orders of the Railway Board.In 2014, the Commissioner of Railway Safety had recommended that charging stations be switched off between 11 pm and 5 am, soon after a fire incident in the Bangalore-Hazur Sahib Nanded Express. The Railway Board had eventually issued such orders to all rail zones."In view of the recent incidents of fire, we have done the needful. It is a precautionary measure and even earlier the Railway Board had issued such orders. The power from the main switchboard for these points will be switched off from 11 pm to 5 am," Guganesan said.This comes after recent incidents of fire reported in some trains. According to railway officials, the decision to restrict the use of the charging ports was taken as a precautionary measure.In a report on the fires, officials suggested that the points used for charging mobile phones and other electronic devices should be switched off at night.Many incidents of minor fires, reported onboard long-distance trains, were caused due to overcharging of electronic devices, officials said.Recently a coach of the Dehradun-bound Shatabdi Express caught fire in a suspected case of a short circuit on March 13. Barely six days later, a fire broke out in the engine of a static goods train at the Ranchi station.The Railways has also announced a slew of initiatives against smoking and carrying inflammable items, which were apparently also the cause behind some of the recent fires onboard trains.The national transporter has instructed zonal railways to initiate an intensive awareness drive of seven days to educate all the stakeholders, including railway users and employees, about precautions to be taken against fire incidents.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-charging-of-electronic-devices-in-trains-at-night-railways-101617163717623.html

They are safe, in good health, and have been working closely with all parties involved to re-float the vessel. Their hard work and tireless professionalism are greatly appreciated," the company said in a statement."BSM extends its deepest gratitude to all parties involved in the emergency response, including the Suez Canal Authority, SMIT Salvage and the crew on board, who worked tirelessly to free the vessel and to restore navigability in the Suez Canal," the statement further said.The experts are now probing the reason for the incident. When blame gets assigned, it will likely lead to years of litigation to recoup the costs of repairing the ship, fixing the canal and reimbursing those who saw their cargo shipments disrupted.Since the vessel is owned by a Japanese firm, operated by a Taiwanese shipper, flagged in Panama and now stuck in Egypt, matters quickly gained international attention.Experts boarded the Ever Given as it idled Tuesday in Egypt's Great Bitter Lake, just north of the site where it previously blocked the canal. A senior canal pilot, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to speak to the media, told The Associated Press that experts were looking for signs of damage and trying to determine why the vessel ran aground.The Ever Given had crashed into a bank of a single-lane stretch of the canal about 6 kilometers north of the southern entrance, near the city of Suez, on March 23. That forced some ships to take the long, alternate route around the Cape of Good Hope at Africa’s southern tip - a 5,000-kilometer detour that costs ships hundreds of thousands of dollars in fuel and other costs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/25-indian-crew-onboard-ever-given-in-good-health-says-company-101617162607905.html

In fact, organisations working for the scheduled castes and tribes have already been given this facility. This can be extended to the groups working for Divyaangs,” Shivaji Kumar, disabilities commissioner, said.Letters in this direction have been sent to the electricity department and the managing director of the North Bihar and South Bihar Power Distribution Companies a couple of days ago and they have been asked to submit a compliance report by April 16, he added.Vinod Bhanti, an expert in artificial limb making, said many institutions start working for physically challenged people but fail to sustain after some time and one of the main reasons is the high electricity charges on commercial rates. “The population of Divyaangs in the state is quite high and even in this population, the percentage of disabled children is quite high. We need more and more institutions and organisations to work for them,” he said.The percentage of disabled persons in the state out of the country’s total population of physically challenged is 8.69%, as per the Census 2011. And in the population of physically challenged, 12.48% are children (0-6years) which is the highest in the country, Bhanti said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/institutions-for-physically-challenged-people-in-bihar-to-get-subsidised-power-101617162471600.html

Police said that the accused has been identified and they have lunched raids to arrest him.The girl was admitted to a government hospital and her condition is said to be stable. “We have identified the accused, who is a labourer and police teams have been formed to arrest him. The accused was known to the family of the victim since he was living in the same locality. He will be arrested soon,” said Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP), Raipur, Ajay Yadav. Police said that on Monday when everyone was celebrating Holi, the accused raped the girl and fled from the locality. The locals rushed the girl to a government hospital in Raipur on Monday evening. “On Monday, the girl’s condition was critical but on Tuesday she was stable according to doctors,” said Yadav. In February, 16-year-old girl was raped by nine men in the tribal dominated Jashpur district of Chhattisgarh. The girl and her friend were returning home from school when nine people stopped the duo. The accused then thrashed the boy until he fell unconscious. Subsequently, the accused took the girl inside a nearby jungle and raped her.

31-03-2021||India||KCR takes u-turn, orders purchase of paddy through 6,400 procurement centers||In a u-turn, the Telangana government has decided to procure paddy from farmers during this rabi season by setting up as many as 6,408 procurement centres in the rural areas all over the state. A decision to this effect was taken at a high-level review meeting called by chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao on Monday night. According to an official statement from the chief minister’s office, the decision was taken in the wake of the continuing Covid-19 pandemic.The decision comes at a time when the farmers in many parts of the country have been agitating for several months against the contentious central legislations on agriculture that allow the farmers to sell their crops anywhere in the market and the state government won’t have to open purchasing centres to procure agriculture commodities. Though the Telangana government initially opposed the central laws, it changed its stand later and declared that it won’t procure agricultural produce anymore. KCR, as the chief minister is known, announced in December last year that the process of sale and purchase of agricultural produce should be left to the market. He went to the extent of saying that his government was not a business organisation or trader; neither a rice miller nor a dal miller. “Sale and purchase are not the responsibility of the government. It is not possible to set up a purchase centre in the village from next year onwards,” the chief minister said then. But on Monday, the Telangana chief minister reverted to his old decision and announced procurement of paddy from the farmers this year, too, as was done in the past. He directed that the authorities make arrangements for procurement of paddy during the summer season through 6,408 centres in the villages all over the State. He instructed principal secretary (finance) Ramakrishna Rao to make all arrangements to give bank guarantee for ₹20,000 crore towards paddy procurement. He asked chief secretary Somesh Kumar to conduct an emergency videoconference with all the collectors for the setting up of the procurement centres. He asked agriculture minister Niranjan Reddy to monitor the setting up of the procurement centres and the procurement of paddy. He also instructed the minister and the chief secretary to take all precautions so that farmers were not put to any difficulty during procurement.Out of 6,408 procurement centres, there will be 2,131 Indira Kranthi Patham (IKP) centres (rural markets), 3,964 primary agriculture cooperative societies (PACS) and 313 other smaller markets. KCR also instructed that Minimum Support Price (MSP) be implemented and ensured while farmers bring their paddy to the centres. He asked the farmers to ensure that the paddy to be brought to the procurement centres should have not more than 17 per cent moisture. The farmers should ensure that the moisture percentage is less and they should follow conditions of the MSP. The chief minister also instructed the officials to keep the 20 crore gunny bags ready at the procurement centres. This summer season, paddy has been cultivated in 52.76 lakh acres, and it is expected that the yield would be 1.17 crore tonnes of the coarse variety Paddy and 21 lakh tonnes of fine variety paddy, the official note said. KCR also asked the chief secretary to identify lands to be given on lease to the Central Ware Housing Corporation who are ready to construct additional warehouses to store the food grains. The Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party welcomed the chief minister’s decision to procure paddy from the farmers, but said the decision was politically motivated. “The government’s decision is a fallout of the agitations taken up by the Congress party in the last few months. We undertook padayatras and conducted farmers’ rallies all over the state and the chief minister has realised the seriousness of the situation,” Congress Legislature Party leader Mallu Bhatti Vikramarka said. He also suspected that the decision was taken to appease the farmers in the wake of the ensuing bye-elections in Nagarjunsagar assembly constituency which has more than two lakh paddy farmers. The election is scheduled for April 17. BJP official spokesman K Krishna Sagar Rao said KCR had earlier tried to ignore farmers on the pretext of central laws. “Now, he has gone back on his words only to woo farmers in the wake of bye-elections in Nagarjunsagar. In any case, we welcome the decision, as it gives relief to the farmers,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kcr-takes-u-turn-orders-purchase-of-paddy-through-6-400-procurement-centers-101617158691103.html
31-03-2021||India||Bombay high court to hear Param Bir Singh's plea seeking CBI probe against Anil Deshmukh today||The Bombay High Court will on Wednesday hear a petition filed by former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh seeking a probe by Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) against Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh. Singh has claimed that Deshmukh asked police officer Sachin Vaze to collect ₹100 crore from bars and restaurants in Mumbai.Singh initially filed a plea in the Supreme Court, which called the matter serious but asked the former Mumbai top cop to approach the high court. He then filed the criminal Public Interest Litigation (PIL) in the Bombay high court on March 25.In his petition, the IPS officer has also raised the issue of alleged corruption in police transfers and postings in Maharashtra.On Tuesday, senior counsel Vikram Nankani, appearing for Singh, mentioned the petition before a division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice G S Kulkarni and sought urgent hearing.Chief justice Datta asked Nankani about the prayers sought in the petition and if the PIL is maintainable."We will satisfy the court with arguments on the maintainability of the petition," Nankani said.The high court then posted the PIL for hearing on Wednesday.Singh made these allegations in an unsigned letter dated March 20, which was addressed to Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and other senior bureaucrats and politicians. He said that Deshmukh told Vaze that there are about 1,750 bars, restaurants and other establishments in Mumbai and if a sum of ₹2-3 lakh each is collected from each of them, a monthly collection of ₹40-50 crore is achievable.Vaze, the former head of the Crime Intelligence Unit of the Mumbai Crime Branch, is in the custody of the National Investigation Agency (NIA) for his alleged role in planting explosives in an SUV outside industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s house in February.In his PIL, Singh also accused Deshmukh of routinely interfering in police investigations and putting pressure on him to implicate BJP leaders in the case of suicide of Dadra and Nagar Haveli MP Mohan Delkar.Claiming that Deshmukh met Vaze at his residence in mid-February, Singh also sought a direction from the high court to the CBI to secure CCTV footage of the minister's residence before it was "destroyed".The Maharashtra government has, meanwhile, appointed a single-member committee to probe Singh’s allegations against Deshmukh. The panel, which will comprise retired Bombay high court judge Kailas Uttamchand Chandiwal, has been given a timeline of six months to submit a report.Deshmukh denied the charges and the ruling Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government has rallied behind him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bombay-high-court-to-hear-param-bir-singh-s-plea-against-anil-deshmukh-today-101617158245343.html

A number of incriminating documents were also seized from the occupants of the vessel.”“Image of a flying horse was found on all the heroin packets, which is a usual practice of drug trafficking syndicates to brand their drugs. Further, investigations so far indicate that an unknown vessel carried the Heroin and arms consignment from Chabahar Port, Iran and handed over the same to Sri Lankan fishing boat Ravihansi in the high seas near Lakshadweep,” read an NCB statement.All the six Sri Lankan crew members -- LY Nandana, HKGB Dassppriya, AHS Gunasekara, SA Senarath, T Ranasingha and D Nissanka – were taken into custody on Saturday and they have been remanded to judicial custody.“The intelligence inputs and the investigations so far indicate that a Pakistan based drug trafficking network is involved in the current seizure. There have been seizures of huge quantity heroin in the Arabian Sea by both Indian as well as other enforcement agencies which are believed to have trafficked by the same network. This seizure also unveils the nexus between narcotics trafficking and extremist elements,” the NCB said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/300kg-heroin-found-on-lankan-boat-ncb-101617152645899.html

Whereas, the wife can, in any case, file a petition in a competent court, within whose limits she is residing. The said right has been exclusively conferred on a wife so as to keep her convenience in mind in matrimonial matters.”In her plea, the woman had sought transfer of the 2020 case from Bhiwani to Mohali, where she last lived with her husband. The husband, who lives in the United States, had argued that his wife had sufficient means and could easily appear before Bhiwani court.The wife, however, claimed that she was residing with her parents in Mohali, which was 250 km away from Bhiwani. She added that her father was a heart patient and as both her brothers were married and living elsewhere, there was no one to accompany her to the court for hearings.During the hearing, the court observed that ethos as manifested under Article 51-A of the Indian Constitution envisaged that it will be the fundamental duty of every Indian citizen to uphold the dignity of the women. As per Article 15 (3), power was also conferred on the state to make special provisions for women and children in such matters. It was perhaps in this spirit that an amendment was inserted in 2003 in the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, the court added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/wife-has-right-to-pick-court-in-matrimonial-disputes-says-hc-101617150819082.html
31-03-2021||India||Novelist Sharankumar Limbale selected for Saraswati Samman ’20||Marathi novelist, poet, critic and short story writer Sharankumar Limbale was selected for the 2020 Saraswati Samman, a prestigious literary recognition conferred annually by the KK Birla Foundation.The 30th edition of the prize, the highest recognition in the field of Indian literature in the country, was given to Limbale for his 2018 Marathi novel, Sanatan. Apart from the citation, the award carries a plaque and an award money of ₹15 lakh.Sanatan is an important social and historical document of the Dalit struggle, said the KK Birla Foundation, a literary and cultural organisation.“The author has written this novel using many imaginative characters and space. He brilliantly weaved the story of novel with history,” said the foundation in a press statement.Born on June 1, 1956 in Maharashtra’s Solapur district, Limbale obtained his masters degree in Marathi literature and did a Ph.D. in comparative study of Marathi Dalit literature and American Black literature from Shivaji University, Kolhapur. He joined as an assistant editor in the department of publication in the Yashwantrao Chavan Maharashtra Open University, Nashik, from where he retired as a professor and director.Limbale has authored 40 books of novel, poetry, stories and criticism. He has also written critical essays and papers for many seminars.“Sanatan is a first novel of this style which told the story of socio-cultural struggles of untouchables. The author had read many books to write this novel,” said the foundation in its statement. The work was selected by a committee of scholars and writers headed by former secretary general of the Lok Sabha, Subhash C Kashyap. The selection process was three-tiered and involved deep and intense comparative study to find an outstanding work from 22 languages.Instituted in 1991, the Saraswati Samman is given every year to an outstanding literary work written in any Indian language mentioned in Schedule VIII to the Constitution by an Indian citizen published during the 10 years preceding the specified year. Previous recipients include poet Harivansh Rai Bachchan, playwright Vijay Tendulkar and novelist Sunil Gangopadhyay.Besides the Saraswati Samman, two other awards – the Vyas Samman (for Hindi works by Indian citizens) and Bihari Puraskar (for Hindi/Rajasthani works by Rajasthani writers) — have been instituted by the KK Birla Foundation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/novelist-sharankumar-limbale-selected-for-saraswati-samman-20-101617150004198.html

Both cases came to light because of our own internal probe,” the Army Chief told news agency ANI.“No matter when such misdeeds come to light anybody who enrolled or got selected through improper means his services can be terminated anytime whether it is during training, service or 20 years later,” he said. Asserting that he will not tolerate such incidents, General Naravane said: “We will not tolerate any such incidents and we will come down heavily on whoever tries to malign Army through very incorrect activities. There is no question of shielding anybody who is indulging in such kind of malpractices.”On handing over the paper leak case to the CBI, the Army Chief said: “When these cases came to light we realised that there are other parties involved, civilians involved, transactions made to a bank, call records that need to be looked into.

31-03-2021||India||India debates zero emission target: What is at stake?||India’s climate policy establishment is engaged in an intense debate on a key policy question which will determine the future development and environmental trajectory of the nation — will, and should, India join the elite club of nations that have announced a net zero emission target by the mid-century in the run up to the UN climate change conference (COP 26) in Glasgow this November?Though a net zero target may sound reassuring when the severe impact of the climate crisis is already being felt, experts point out that it is difficult to achieve and will have long lasting implications for India’s economic story.Enhanced global pressureAround 58 countries have announced net zero emission targets so far, according to Climatewatchdata.org. Achieving the target implies that all remaining human-caused greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are balanced out by removing GHGs from the atmosphere in a process known as carbon removal. This may be achieved by various modes, including restoring forests or through direct air capture and storage (DACS) technology, according to the World Resources Institute.The White House announced on January 27 that President Joe Biden will take steps to put the US on an “irreversible path” to a net zero economy by 2050. Consequently, Biden has also called for a summit of major emitting nations on April 22 in order to persuade them to commit to ambitious mitigation targets.“Yes, India will participate in the summit. But I haven’t heard any plans of announcing a net zero emissions target. It requires complete transformation and could derail our development plans. India cannot take on net zero target at the moment... The world will be better placed to declare any new targets when global stocktaking process concludes in 2023,” said a senior official of the environment ministry, on condition of anonymity.Union environment minister Prakash Javadekar said in Rajya Sabha on March 15: “India continues to uphold the need for equitable access to carbon space as among the key principles guiding implementation of the Paris Agreement, as well as the achievement of the larger goal of sustainable development in keeping with the needs and aspirations of its people.”Is net zero a panacea?India is under diplomatic pressure to join the net zero club. But, there are two issues to consider.One of them is whether a net zero emissions target can actually secure the planet from the devastating impacts of the climate crisis. Dave Elliott, an emeritus professor of technology policy at the Open University in UK, wrote in Physicsworld that the net zero formulation does not usually specify how net zero emissions are achieved; so, in principle, any project will be acceptable if it can claim to avoid, or compensate for, carbon dioxide production. These can include carbon offset and carbon removal projects, as well as renewable energy and energy efficiency schemes.Experts have raised concerns about whether India should bet on such long term uncertain strategies. “Rather than jumping on the bandwagon by setting far-off, false targets, India has the opportunity to lead with real zero actions that radically reduce emissions, rapidly green its economy, tackle air pollution at home and help achieve climate goals globally,” said Harjeet Singh, global climate lead at ActionAid.Idea of climate justiceThe other dimension to net zero targets is that it brushes over one of the most important principles of 2015 Paris Agreement — “common but differentiated responsibility”. This requires richer countries to lead and take historical responsibility for the emissions caused in the past by them. Linked to this is the concept of climate justice, which underlines that the devastating impacts of the crisis will not be borne out equally by the rich and poor.Shyam Saran, former special envoy and chief negotiator on climate change, said: “For India... it is important that mitigation does not overshadow other key elements of the Paris Climate agreement...

31-03-2021||India||India-China border row: Air forces hold formation in Ladakh||As India and China negotiate a complex disengagement process to pull back their troops and weapons from friction points in eastern Ladakh, the air forces of both countries remain to be deployed in the theatre just as they were when the border row was at its peak last year, people familiar with the developments said on Tuesday.“There has been no change in the posture or the deployment of the Indian Air Force in the Ladakh sector. Nor have we noticed any change in the deployment of the Chinese People’s Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF),” said one of the officials cited above.India and China have held 10 rounds of military talks so far to resolve border tensions that began last May. The 10th round of talks between corps commander-ranked officers of the two armies took place on February 20 after the completion of disengagement on strategic heights on both banks of Pangong Tso.

Dates are yet to be announced for the 11th round of military talks that are expected to focus on outstanding problems with the PLA at Depsang, Hot Springs and Gogra.As India and China prepare for those, little is likely to change for the air force deployments, said Air Marshal Anil Chopra (retd), director general, Centre for Air Power Studies.“IAF’s air defence assets, unmanned aerial vehicles, transport and helicopter fleets will continue to be on station in Ladakh. Our fighter airbases within 350 km of eastern Ladakh will remain on standby. Same will be true for China. The situation will change only after some political settlement is reached,” said Chopra. Apart from deploying fighter jets at bases in the Ladakh-Tibet theatre, PLAAF has also positioned a large number of radars and missiles in the sector, a second official said.IAF has projected its capability to carry out day-and-night, all-weather combat missions in the Ladakh sector, with front-line fighter jets, attack helicopters and multi-mission choppers deployed there. It also deployed its new Rafale fighter jets in sector as part of India’s overarching plan to strengthen its military posture in the region.Watch | ‘Not an inch has been lost…’: Army chief on India-China disengagement in LadakhThe air force’s MiG-29 fighter jets, Sukhoi-30s, Apache AH-64E attack helicopters and CH-47F (I) Chinook multi-mission helicopters are among the platforms that have operated in the Ladakh sector.At a marathon 16-hour meeting between senior commanders on February 20, the Indian and Chinese armies agreed to resolve outstanding issues at friction points on the contested Line of Actual Control (LAC) in a “steady and orderly” manner. They were also unanimous that the Pangong Tso disengagement provided “a good basis” for resolving pending problems and decided to take forward the military dialogue to stabilise the ground situation in eastern Ladakh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indiachina-border-row-air-forces-hold-formation-in-ladakh-101617138487983.html
31-03-2021||India||Govt warns surge in Covid-19 cases can overwhelm resources||The surge in Covid-19 cases across the country at present has the potential to overwhelm India’s health care infrastructure, the Union government said in a warning to states on Tuesday, even as the national positivity rate crossed 5% for the first time since October, indicating the severity of the ongoing second wave.The government urged states to take immediate steps to limit the outbreak and strengthen hospitals and enhance intensive care capacities.During the weekly briefing, the Union government officials separately identified the current hotbeds (10 districts in particular, of which eight are in Maharashtra) and said immediate steps must be taken to improve testing of people and isolation of those infected in order to control a situation that one expert described as going from “bad to worse”.“Since the past few weeks, the situation is going from bad to worse, which is a serious cause for concern. In some states in particular, there is a huge cause for worry, so no state, no part of our country, no district should be complacent. What the trends show is that the virus is still very active, can penetrate our defences, and when we think we have found ways to control the virus, it strikes back. It has done so in our country; it has done so in other countries,” said VK Paul, member (Health) of Niti Aayog.Paul was speaking at the briefing where the Union health secretary gave new figures that underscore the worsening trend. Among them was the average positivity rate for the country, which has risen above 5% for the first time since October 22.“The weekly national average positivity rate is 5.65%. Maharashtra has a weekly average of 23%, Punjab has a weekly average of 8.82%, Chhattisgarh 8%, Madhya Pradesh 7.82%, Tamil Nadu 2.50%, Karnataka 2.45%, Gujarat 2.2% and Delhi 2.04%,” health secretary Rajesh Bhushan said.Also read | 14 countries express ‘shared concerns’ over WHO report on Covid-19 originsIn a letter to states, he separately wrote: “…the current rise in cases is of concern and has the potential of overwhelming health care systems, unless checked right now.”Ten districts in the country currently account for the majority of active Covid-19 cases, with eight of them in Maharashtra alone, the officials said at the briefing.While testing has been low over the past two days due to the weekend and the festival of Holi, the daily average of cases added across the country over the week till March 29 was around 58,000, the highest since October 20.The surge, Bhushan said, was due to inadequate Covid-19 testing, lack of public health measures, and because of specific events or places where crowding happens.“The need is for states to exponentially increase Covid-19 testing, especially, the proportion of RT-PCR testing should be increased up to at least 70%. The rising cases also highlight public health measures are not being taken as per requirement such as implementation of containment strategy, effective contact tracing, appropriately physically isolating positive cases, etc,” he added.The districts with high active case loads are Pune, Mumbai, Nagpur, Thane, Nashik, Aurangabad, Bengaluru Urban, Nanded, Delhi, and Ahmednagar.To be sure, India’s vaccination drive is just picking up momentum. A total of 62.3 million vaccine shots have been administered till Tuesday at 7pm, with 9 million people having received both shots, and 44.3 million one. The drive is expected to kick up a hear from April 1 when anyone over the age of 45 years becomes eligible for a vaccine.Also read | With 27,918 Covid-19 cases, Maharashtra’s tally at 2,773,435In Maharashtra, officials have floated the idea of a lockdown in order to contain the outbreak, but added that they will first explore regional restrictions and curbs such as closing restaurants and theatres before considering a blanket shutdown.In Delhi, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said more hospitals beds were being set aside for Covid-19 patients.On Saturday, the Centre released a list of 47 districts across the country that are currently reporting an unusual surge of Covid-19 cases.“Some districts that saw a high number of cases in August-November are again seeing a high growth rate of cases. In addition, a number of new districts that saw a limited prevalence earlier, are worryingly, showing a surge in Covid cases. States/UTs and districts that have current low levels of cases, however, cannot be complacent,” the letter read.The government outlined five areas for the districts to focus on: improving testing and tracing, ensuring proper isolation of infected people, strengthening health care capacities, enforcing appropriate behaviour in public places and prioritising vaccinations.The government also asked to states to demarcate containment zones with stringent controls in place and improve surveillance by mapping cases and reviewing statistics from different areas (including indicators such as the rate of test positivity, growth of cases, case fatality, and the doubling time of cases). “All districts with high case loads and fast growth of cases must ensure 100% saturation vaccination of the priority age group of 45 years and above in the coming two weeks,” the letter read.Experts said this phase is critical in controlling the outbreak.“How we act at this stage will make a huge difference in how the disease progresses. Vaccination and following Covid-appropriate behavior is the key in controlling the disease,” said Dr GC Khilnani, former head, department of pulmonology, AIIMS.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-warns-surge-can-overwhelm-resources-101617137225192.html
31-03-2021||India||2 days ahead of Mahakumbh, Rishikesh and Haridwar emerge as Covid-19 hotspots||Amid the recent surge in Covid-19 cases in the state with several instances of a significant number of tourists testing positive especially in the town of Rishikesh, experts say Haridwar and Rishikesh are emerging as the hotspots of the infection in Uttarakhand. The fear was evident with the incidents including one Covid-19 infection at a five-star hotel in Rishikesh where about 76 people tested positive for the virus leading the administration to shut down the hotel for three days for sanitisation. Similarly, before that, 22 tourists part of a 50 member contingent from Gujarat who came to Rishikesh, tested positive for Covid-19 leading to panic among the locals in the town. In another incident, 11 staff of a yoga resort also tested positive for the virus a few days ago. Besides the apprehension that Mahakumbh could emerge as a superspreader, the incidents are worrying the hoteliers and people related to the hospitality industry in Rishikesh who fear that if tourists continue to test positive in the town, then it may severely affect their business-like last year’s lockdown. Also, many people who are coming to Mahakumbh are either visiting Rishikesh, or staying there given better hotels and accommodations there. Government should conduct random testing of guests: Hoteliers Greater Rishikesh Hotels and Resorts Association president Vijay Bisht said, “The rising number of cases among tourists is obviously a matter of concern for us. As more cases get reported, the more tourists will refrain from coming to Rishikesh, affecting our business which already hit a low last year due to lockdown during peak tourism season.” Urging the government to conduct random Covid-19 tests on guests coming to the town and isolate them if found positive, Bisht said, “Shutting down a hotel if guests test positive is not the solution. It not only damages the reputation of the hotel but also sends a negative message among the tourists to not visit the place fearing the infection.” “Instead, the government should isolate the people turning positive instead of creating a hype about the spread. The government should create fear but aware the people on taking precautions so as to curb the infection,” said Bisht adding that the hotels at their level are also taking all the necessary precautions. He said that the hotels in the town are focusing on keeping their staff safe while asking them to follow all precautions strictly. “We cannot ask all the guests to bring mandatory Covid-19 RT-PCR negative test report as it will discourage them from coming which will then hamper our business,” said Bisht. Another hotelier and founding member of Rishikesh Hotel Association, Sanjiv Goyal said, “The business is already down this season too.” Goyal said, “Our business last year was almost nil as the hotels were closed due to the lockdown. This month too after Covid-19 cases have increased again, our business is dipping with most of the bookings being cancelled in the last few days.” He said that usually during Holi, all the Rishikesh hotels are full, “But this year it didn’t happen.” Goyal also said that, “There is also no business for the Char Dham Yatra so far” Rishikesh is considered to be the gateway to Char Dham Yatra, but so far there have been no bookings for it on hotels. We are fearing a repetition of last year’s business situation if the cases continue to rise.” Government needs to strictly implement precautions: Experts Amid the rising number of Covid-19 cases, experts said that the government needs to “implement the precautions more strictly”. Anoop Nautiyal, social activist who had been keeping an eye on the Covid-19 situation in Uttarakhand since last year’s lockdown said, “The surge in the cases again in the state is a big worry.” Nautiyal said, “In what many experts are calling as the second wave of infections, the government have to take this seriously and make the people adhere to precautions like in last year’s lockdown especially in Rishikesh and Haridwar.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2-days-ahead-of-mahakumbh-rishikesh-and-haridwar-emerge-as-covid-19-hotspots-101617136371900.html

His reference may have been to the circumstances surrounding the chief minister’s ascent to the top job but it sparked an outrage. Stalin himself warned his partymen to maintain the decencies of debate, and Raja has apologised for the comment.The PM also took a swipe at the DMK over dynastic politics, saying the “crown prince” sidelined many senior leaders of that party, referring to the ascent of Stalin’s son Udhayanidhi.The Prime Minister sought to reiterate his respect and affinity for the Tamil language. “One of the greatest moments of my life was when I could speak in a few words in the oldest language in the world, Tamil at the United Nations,” he said.Palaniswami was also present at the rally with his deputy O Panneerselvam and other coalition leaders.Later in the day, the PM addressed a rally in Kerala’s Palakkad. The BJP has fielded E Sreedharan, the former chief of the Delhi Metro and one of India’s most respected technocrats from the constituency.The PM targeted Kerala’s ruling LDF over the gold smuggling case, allegedly involving the former principal secretary to chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan, saying the Communist Party of India (Marxist)-led government “betrayed” the people of the state just as Judas did Jesus for a few pieces of silver.“Judas betrayed Lord Christ for a few pieces of silver. LDF has betrayed Kerala for a few pieces of gold,” the PM said.Reacting to his remark, the CPI(M) said it did not need a certificate from the PM.Also read | No Prime Minister has ever done this: Trinamool moves EC over PM Modi’s Bangladesh visit“All central agencies are under him.

Now, the first-time voters of Kerala are asking- what is this match fixing?” Modi said.“Five years one loots, five years the other loots. People are seeing how the UDF and LDF misled the people,” Modi said as he expressed hope that the chain of alternating power between two fronts will be broken this time.The two parties have alternated in power since 1982.“Only the BJP can ensure fast development to the state,” he said.At the rally in the Union territory of Puducherry, the PM targeted the “non-performing” Congress government (which collapsed just ahead of the polls) over the years in Puducherry.“In the long list of non-performing Congress governments over the years, the previous Puducherry Government has a special place.

The country can fight any adverse situation and challenges coming our way. We have fared better than many countries."Elaborating on how the success on the front of Covid-19 can be replicated in India's fight against TB, the Union Health Minister said, "Another goal in front of us is to eliminate the TB by 2025. Our efforts of testing, tracing, and treating in COVID-19 can be replicated for the treatment of TB. The experience from the pandemic can be used to achieve the goal of eliminating TB by 2025."According to the Union Health Ministry, the document is a chronicle of the response to the pandemic for the period January 2020 to November 2020.Expressing immense pleasure on the comprehensive response of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare to the Covid-19 pandemic in the country, he said, "This is a historical moment for all of us.

According to the summer schedule of flights operations approved for 2021 on Tuesday, an average of 18,843 departures per week has been approved -- a significant jump from the roughly 14,500 weekly average seen in December.“During the surveillance of some airports, it has come to notice that compliance (of Covid-19 protocols) is not satisfactory. All airport operators, therefore, are requested to ensure that the instructions on Covid-19 protocol from the standpoint of wearing face mask properly, covering nose and mouth, as well as maintaining social distance norms within the airport premises are followed scrupulously,” DGCA said in an order to airport operators on Monday.According to the DGCA, at least 15 passengers till date have been charged for violating Covid-19 norms in domestic and may be put on a “no-flying” list for a period of three months.“The possibility of taking punitive action, such as levy of spot fines in accordance with law, shall also be explored with the local police authorities so as to serve a deterrent for violation of Covid-19 protocol,” DGCA added in the order, issued Tuesday.The regulator’s latest order comes even as the number of Covid-19 cases in the country continues to rise sharply. the seven-day average of cases as on March 29 was 58,424, up from a low of 10,988 on February 11. It also comes as the number of air passengers continues to increase.According to DGCA data, the number of passengers carried by domestic airlines in February 2021 was 15.5 million compared to 7.7 million in January. Though departures and kilometers flown are still under pre-pandemic levels, they have continuously been improving.In December, the latest period for which such data is available, 64,002 departures took place -- translating to roughly 14,452 a week on average. Over the summer period, which DGCA considers as extending from the last Sunday of March to the last Sunday of October, the aviation regulator has cleared 18,843 per week.The aviation regulator also reiterated on Tuesday its older order issued on March 13. in which it directed airport authorities and airlines to take strict action against those not complying with Covid-19 protocols at airports and inside planes. Those found flouting rules may be offloaded and handed over to security agencies, it added.“The Airport Director/Terminal Manager, as applicable, must ensure that passengers are wearing masks properly and do maintain social distance at all times within the Airport premises. In case, any passenger is not following “COVID-19 Protocol”, they should be handed over to security agencies after proper warnings. If required, they may be dealt as per law.”Also read | Maharashtra rules out statewide lockdown for now, localised curbs possible“Our fight against COVID continues.Advisory issued to all airports to ensure compliance of COVID19 Protocol. People must wear face masks (covering nose & mouth)& maintain social distance. We are moving in direction of punitive action by police against passengers who don’t comply,” civil aviation minister Hardeep Puri tweeted.The March 13 order came days after the Delhi high court issued a set of guidelines that empowered airline crew to offload any passenger not wearing masks (or not wearing them properly) and put them on the no-fly list if they exhibited “stubborn reluctance”. The judge took note of the callous attitude of passengers at airports and passed directions to DGCA.Soon after, DGCA also informed the Delhi High Court that action was being taken against passengers not wearing masks properly despite repeated warnings and that they would be de-boarded from planes before departure and treated as “unruly passengers”.On March 16, four passengers on board Alliance Air flight 91 614 from Jammu to New Delhi were deboarded for not following COVID-19 protocols inside the flight, according to DGCA. The passengers were charged as “unruly/disruptive passengers” and handed over to security agencies at Delhi Airport.Last week, union Civil aviation minister Hardeep Singh Puri said the government has no plans to curtail flight services further amid the second wave of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). However, plans to restore full-fledged flight schedules from April 1 have been postponed amid a sharp rise in Covid-19 cases. Flights are currently allowed to operate up to 80% of their pre-covid capacity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bolster-airport-checks-consider-spot-fine-dgca-101617130309967.html
31-03-2021||India||Covishield shelf life extended from 6 to 9 months: Govt||New Delhi India’s drug regulator has approved the expiry period for the Covishield vaccine to be increased from six to nine months, top officials in the government said on Tuesday.Covishield, which has been developed by Oxford-AstraZeneca against Covid-19, is locally manufactured and sold by the Serum Institute of India (SII).“Yes, the manufacturer has been allowed to extend the expiration time period for Covishield to 9 months. The process is, when any drug or a vaccine is given emergency use authorization by the drugs controller general of India, its shelf life is determined by the stability data that is furnished by the manufacturer at that point in time when approval for an EUA is sought. As the drug or the vaccine becomes older, there is addition to the data and further extensions are given on the basis of stability and sterility data. The initial shelf-life of six months was approved based on the earlier stability data,” said Rajesh Bhushan, Union secretary, ministry of health and family welfare.Also read | Govt to ramp up Covid-19 beds as Capital adds 992 fresh infectionsConcerns regarding Covid-19 vaccine wastage were raised as SII began production of the Covid-19 vaccine before being granted emergency use authorisation for use in India on January 3. The company began manufacturing Covishield around October last year, and the product had a shelf life of six months.However, experts at the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) said that vaccine wastage was not the criterion for extending the shelf life.“It is not done because of reducing vaccine wastage; that is a different matter altogether. Approving increase of shelf life is done under a due process based on the stability data that a manufacturer furnishes at the time of seeking emergency use approval and updating it at subsequent intervals such as 9 months, 12 months or even more depending on the type of product, and the duration for which it is in use,” said a CDSCO official, requesting not to be identified.“The data is analysed by experts to see if the efficacy of the product continues to remain the same during the extended interval. In future as the product gets older, if the company provides updated stability data for seeking further increase in expiration period, the experts will consider that too,” said the CDSCO official.The government on Tuesday reiterated that both Covid-19 vaccines approved for use in India -- Covishield and Covaxin -- are safe and effective against mutant variants of Sars-CoV-2.“Both Covishield and Covaxin vaccines are effective against the UK and the Brazilian variants of coronavirus, while the work against the South African strain was on at several laboratories,” said Dr Balram Bhargava, director general, Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).Of 11,064 genome samples sequenced in the country, the UK variant of the virus was detected in 807, the South African variant in 47 and the Brazilian variant was found in one.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covishield-shelf-life-extended-from-6-to-9-months-govt-101617130309502.html
31-03-2021||India||Heat wave, dust storm hit NW India||Several parts of north-west India recorded heat wave conditions on Monday, which abated on Tuesday after dry, dusty winds started blowing over most parts of the Indo-Gangetic plains, according to India Meteorological Department scientists.Most parts of the Indo-Gangetic plains also recorded poor air quality and visibility due to strong dust-laden winds blowing at 30 to 40kmph from the westerly and north-westerly direction.IMD scientists said loose soil combined with strong westerly winds led to these conditions. There is a 42% rain deficiency in March (till March 30) over northwest India, data showed. East and West Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh and Delhi recorded “large deficiency” in rainfall, which is over 60% below normal rain.“There were hardly any western disturbances in January and February. In March, there was an intense WD but we still have large deficiency. So, there is loose soil which is making the air dusty,” said Kuldeep Shrivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre.According to IMD scientists, dust-raising winds are affecting the entire Indo-Gangetic plains region. “Our models are showing that similar strong winds will prevail for 2-3 days. There is no moisture incursion over the region. Winds are blowing from dry regions to the west and northwest. Heat wave conditions were recorded over parts of Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Delhi on Monday because of clear skies, uninterrupted solar radiation and low wind speed but we do not expect temperatures to go up now because of the winds. Maximum temperatures will shoot up again from April 2 or 3,” said K Sathi Devi, head, national weather forecasting centre.Also read | Dusty winds add to pollution, mercury may rise from Apr 2Heat wave conditions were recorded in many pockets of northwest India on Monday, with severe heat wave observed over West Rajasthan and heat wave conditions in isolated pockets over Himachal Pradesh and East Rajasthan. Maximum temperatures of more than 40 degrees C were recorded in most pockets of West Rajasthan and Vidarbha; in many pockets over West Madhya Pradesh and Odisha; in some pockets over East Rajasthan, Gujarat, Jharkhand, Marathwada and in isolated pockets over Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi, Gangetic West Bengal, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Maharashtra, Telangana, North Interior Karnataka, Rayalaseema and Tamil Nadu. The highest maximum temperature of 43.3 degrees C was reported at Churu in West Rajasthan and Brahmapuri (Vidarbha). Highest temperature of 42.4 degrees C was recorded at Jamshedpur on Tuesday.Maximum temperatures are likely to fall by 3-5 degrees C over the plains of northwest India during the next 2-3 days, leading to abatement of heat wave conditions over Rajasthan. Another heat wave spell is likely over the plains of northwest India from April 3, IMD said in its bulletin on Tuesday. Dust-raising strong surface winds (speed reaching 30-40kmph) are very likely to prevail over Rajasthan, Haryana, Delhi, West Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, north Madhya Pradesh, East Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand and Gangetic West Bengal during March 30 to April 1.A severe heat wave affected Delhi on Monday as the maximum temperature was 40.1 degrees C, 8 degrees C above normal, which is also the highest March temperature after March 31, 1945 .According to IMD, heat wave is recorded when departure of maximum temperature from normal is + 4 degrees C to + 5 degrees C or more for the regions where the normal maximum temperature is more than 40 degrees C. Another criterion for IMD to declare heat wave is when departure of maximum temperature from normal is + 5 degrees C to + 6 degrees C for regions where the normal maximum temperature is 40 degrees C or less. (Heat wave is declared only when the maximum temperature of a station reaches at least 40 degrees C for plains and at least 30 degrees C for hilly regions).A heat wave can also be declared when the actual maximum temperature remains 45 degrees C or more for a day irrespective of normal maximum temperature, officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/heat-wave-dust-storm-hit-nw-india-101617130189485.html
31-03-2021||India||Took the vaccine to prove to hesitant friends it is safe: 75-yr-old resident||Brij Mohan Vasishta, 75, was walking towards the hospital’s waiting area after taking the first dose of Covishield on March 6 when he turned around. He had forgotten to get himself clicked. He hurried back, whispered a special request in the nurse’s ear and was in the queue a minute later.The elderly man eased himself into the chair, pulled up his sleeve, struck a fearless pose and looked into the camera as the nurse obliged by pretending to inject him. His wife, Smita, followed suit.“Many of my elderly friends were apprehensive about taking the vaccine. I know at least four friends who registered for the vaccine immediately after seeing my photo. That’s why I did it,” said Vasishta, a retired property developer in Faridabad.He waited just 10 minutes; the shot felt nothing more than a prick, and the 30-minute examination after the injection passed by smoothly. “If you told me during the peak of the pandemic that vaccination would be such an easy exercise, I wouldn’t have believed it,” he said.He had read about some cases of recipients battling side effects but wasn’t concerned. “When hundreds of millions of people are getting vaccinated, a few deaths could even be of natural causes,” Vasishta said.Having lived through the first wave of infections that ravaged the national capital region last year, Vasishta was thankful to have a way out. “I had expected it to take at least three years for the vaccine to develop,” he said.He suffers from a host of age-related ailments such as blood pressure, diabetes and thyroid. And, he was quick to understand the threat posed by the disease that has claimed 160,000 lives in India. “Covid-19 is a death ticket”.But Vasishta was keen to live – and hence instituted a strict protocol for his family of eight, who share a four bedroom house in Faridabad.“For the first six months, my wife, 15-year-old grandson, and I did not step out of the house even once. Family members who left the house for essential services had to follow a strict sanitisation protocol on return. My eyes would always be on the door to see if anyone was leaving unnecessarily. The younger members of the family would be agitated by my strictness, but I was unrelenting,” said Vasishta.The caution paid off. There were a couple of virus scares but no one in his family was infected.As the months passed, his lifestyle turned sedentary, he put on weight, missed his social circle, and grew a French beard.He also patiently waited for the vaccine to arrive, following the development of the shots worldwide. And when it did, some people around him questioned its safety, but Vasishta said he imposed his faith in the medical fraternity.A few relatives dissuaded him from taking the jab early on. Vasishta heard about how the vaccine was not tested properly, it caused complications in people with co-morbidity and that it wasn’t effective in the first place.“On March 1, when the Prime Minister got vaccinated, all my doubts were dispelled. The next day, my children booked my appointment and I turned to my hesitant elderly friends to convince them to take the vaccine,” he said.Vasishta initially hoped to get Covaxin, the shot manufactured by Hyderabad-based firm Bharat Biotech in association with Indian Council of Medical Research.His preference was determined by media reports that said Covaxin (81%) was marginally more effective than Covishield, the shot made by Serum Institute of India has an efficacy rate of 70-75%. “Moreover, the Prime Minister was administered Covaxin,” Vasishta said.But on the day of his appointment on March 6, a doctor told him to avoid Covaxin because he was on blood thinners. Hours later, he was sitting in the vaccination centre, receiving Covishield.Vasishta is now waiting for his second dose, due in four days, going by the 28-day gap rule. Until then, he isn’t letting down his guard, except for one day last week when he took the scooter for a spin in the neighbourhood. “I felt I was flying,” he said.From April 1, India opens Covid-19 vaccination to all people above 45. Taking the shot is important, especially as the country battles its second wave of cases. The vaccination drive has been dogged by hesitancy, despite the shots being rigorously tested to be safe. In a new series, HT asks people who are eligible to take the jab, and busts misinformation surrounding the vaccines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/took-the-vaccine-to-prove-to-hesitant-friends-it-is-safe-75-yr-old-delhi-resident-101617130129525.html
31-03-2021||India||India supports UN initiative for ceasefire in Afghanistan, says Jaishankar||India backs a UN-led regional process to achieve a political settlement and comprehensive ceasefire in Afghanistan as the situation in the war-torn country continues to cause grave concern, external affairs minister S Jaishankar said on Tuesday.Jaishankar made the remarks in Dushanbe while speaking at the ministerial meeting of the Heart of Asia-Istanbul Process, a regional initiative of 15 countries, including China, Russia, Iran and Central Asian states, to find a lasting solution to the situation in Afghanistan. This was the first reaction from the Indian side to the UN-led initiative proposed by the Biden administration.Addressing a gathering that included Pakistan’s foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi, Jaishankar also said durable peace in Afghanistan requires a “genuine ‘double peace’” or “peace within Afghanistan and peace around Afghanistan”. He added, “It requires harmonising the interests of all, both within and around that country.”India’s backing for a regional process on Afghanistan convened by the UN – first suggested by US secretary of state Antony Blinken in a letter sent to Afghan President Ashraf Ghani in February – came against the backdrop of worries in New Delhi that the country has been kept out of other processes such as Russia’s “extended troika”.Jaishankar said: “India welcomes any move towards a genuine political settlement and a comprehensive and permanent ceasefire in Afghanistan. We appreciate the international recognition of foundational principles that will determine their contours.”He added, “We support a regional process to be convened under the aegis of the United Nations. UN stewardship would help to take into account all relevant UN resolutions and improve the odds for a lasting outcome.”Also read | S Jaishankar, Ashraf Ghani exchange views on peace process in AfghanistanIn his letter, Blinken outlined four elements as part of a high-level diplomatic effort involving regional countries and the UN to move quickly toward a settlement in Afghanistan. One of these four elements is a meeting to be convened by the UN of foreign ministers and envoys from Russia, China, Pakistan, Iran, India and the US to forge a unified approach on Afghanistan. The date for this meeting is yet to be finalised.Jaishankar said the situation in Afghanistan continues to be a “cause for grave concern”, as violence and bloodshed are “daily realities and the conflict itself has shown little sign of abatement, whatever may be the promises”.Noting that the past few months have witnessed an escalation in targeted killings of civil society, he said that “2020 sadly marked a 45% increase in civilian casualties in Afghanistan over 2019”, while “2021 does not look very much better”.“The continued involvement of foreign fighters in Afghanistan is particularly disturbing. Heart of Asia members and supporting countries should, therefore, make it a priority to press for an immediate reduction in violence leading to a permanent and comprehensive ceasefire,” he said.According to a UN report issued last year, some 6,500 Pakistani fighters, including members of Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jasih-e-Mohammed, were active in Afghanistan.A declaration adopted at the Heart of Asia meeting expressed concern at the “continued relations between the Taliban and international terrorist groups, including Al-Qaida” and emphasised the importance of ensuring that Afghan territory isn’t used as safe haven for any terrorist group, including Islamic State, al-Qaeda or other regional groups.The declaration supported all efforts for continued negotiations between the Afghan government and the Taliban, and recognised the importance of neighbouring countries. It also supported the UN’s enhanced role in the peace process and said “any political settlement must protect the rights of all Afghans, including women, youth and minorities”.A lot of speculation regarding Jaishankar’s visit to Dushanbe focused on whether he would meet his Pakistani counterpart Qureshi, but there was no such meeting.Jaishankar said that ensuring Afghanistan is free of terrorism, violent extremism and drug and criminal syndicates is a “collective imperative”. He added, “A stable, sovereign and peaceful Afghanistan is truly the basis for peace and progress in our region.”India has supported all efforts to accelerate dialogue between the Afghan government and the Taliban, including intra-Afghan negotiations, and attended the inaugural virtual session of the Doha talks last year, he noted. “If the peace process is to be successful, then it is necessary to ensure that the negotiating parties continue to engage in good faith, with a serious commitment towards reaching a political solution.”At the same time, Jaishankar reiterated India’s interest in preserving the gains made over the past two decades in Afghanistan, including the democratic framework under which elections are held through universal suffrage, sovereignty in domestic and foreign policy and protection of the rights of women, children and minorities.Also read | In Brussels, Blinken offers boost for NATO, cooperation on AfghanistanIndia is also committed to the development partnership with Afghanistan, which involves pledges of $3 billion, including more than 550 community development projects covering all 34 provinces, in order to ensure a self-sustaining nation.As the lead country on trade, commerce and investment CBMs under the Heart of Asia process, India will continue to work on improving Afghanistan’s connectivity through projects such as Chahhabar port in Iran and dedicated air freight corridors between Indian and Afghan cities, Jaishankar said. Excellencies,A lot of speculation regarding Jaishankar’s visit to Dushanbe has focused on whether he will hold a meeting with his Pakistani counterpart Qureshi. However, there was no official word from the Indian or Pakistani side about such a meeting.Ahead of the ministerial meeting of the Heart of Asia process, Jaishankar held talks with Afghan President Ashraf Ghani on Monday night and shared India’s perspectives on the peace process. He also met his Iranian counterpart Javad Zarif and discussed bilateral cooperation, including for Chabahar port.Jaishankar held a separate meeting with his Turkish counterpart Mevlut Cavusoglu and discussed “Afghanistan-related developments and our bilateral relations”, he said in a tweet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-supportsun-initiativefor-ceasefire-in-afghanistan-says-jaishankar-101617129829505.html
31-03-2021||India||Myanmar coup: Manipur retracts order to ‘turn away’ refugees||The Manipur government has withdrawn its earlier order directing authorities in districts bordering Myanmar to “politely turn away” refugees fleeing the neighbouring country where the military seized power last month.A fresh letter by H Gyan Prakash, special secretary (home), government of Manipur, was issued on Monday to deputy commissioners of Chandel, Tengnoupal, Ukhrul,Churachandpur and Kamjong.“The fresh letter was issued on Monday which directed the deputy commissioners in four districts to disregard the earlier letter issued on March 26,” Prakash said over phone from Imphal.In an advisory issued on March 26, Prakash’s office initially directed authorities and civil society groups not to open camps to provide food and shelter to refugees fleeing the neighbouring nation. It also asked them to immediately stop the Aadhaar enrolment exercise in the state, suggesting that there was the possibility of some of the refugees signing up for Aadhaar numbers.“People trying to enter/seek refuge should be politely turned away,” the initial advisory read.It added that in case of “grievous injuries” sustained by Myanmar nationals, medical attention “may be provided on humanitarian considerations”.Also read | Myanmar insurgents sense growing conflict, call for international interventionMonday’s advisory, however, claimed that the earlier one was misinterpreted and that the Manipur government has been providing all aid to Myanmar nationals who entered India via the borders with the state.Prakash too maintained that the Manipur government has been taking all necessary humanitarian steps, including ferrying some of the injured refugees to the state capital for treatment.In order to avoid further misunderstanding, the earlier directive has been withdrawn, the advisory released on Monday said.According to AFP, at least 520 people, including women and children, have been killed across Myanmar in the last one month. The military seized power on February 1 over alleged election irregularities following Aung San Suu Kyi-led NLD’s landslide victory in the general polls.On March 10, the Ministry of Home Affairs wrote to the chief secretaries of Mizoram, Manipur, Nagaland and Arunachal Pradesh and the Assam Rifles guarding the Indo-Myanmar border, to check the influx of people from Myanmar and also to identify the illegal migrants and deport them.The Mizoram government, however, refused to turn away the Myanmar nationals. In a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on March 18, Chief Minister Zoramthanga said that since the people of his state shared ethnic ties with the refugees of the Chin community of Myanmar, they cannot remain indifferent to their plight.According to officials in Mizoram, at least 1,000 Myanmar nationals have entered the state since the coup last month, news agency PTI reported . “As per the home department’s record, 1,042 Myanmarese nationals have entered the state till Monday. While most of them are staying in border villages and are being provided with relief and shelter by local NGOs, some are living with their relatives,” an official told the news agency.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/myanmar-coup-manipur-retracts-order-to-turn-away-refugees-101617129830287.html
