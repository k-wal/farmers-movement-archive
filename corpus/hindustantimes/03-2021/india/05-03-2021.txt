It was found that the animal had entered the field in search of food but got trapped in the live electric wire set up by Singh to protect his crop from wild animals and died due to electrocution.“It has surfaced from evidence that the innocent female matured jumbo lost its life because of the crime committed by the accused. So, considering the factual matrix and circumstance of the case, the accused is sentenced to three years and three months rigorous imprisonment,” the order read.The court also slapped a fine of ₹10,000 on the accused and if he fails to pay that he will have to undergo rigorous imprisonment for another two months.According to state government figures, between 2011 and 2019, at least 90 elephants have fallen prey to electrocution.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-farmer-sentenced-to-time-in-jail-for-death-of-elephant-by-electrocution-101614966281164.html
05-03-2021||India||Greta's comments on farm stir not bilateral issue between India, Sweden: MEA||Young Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg's recent comments on the farmers' protests in India do not form a bilateral issue between India and Sweden, and the matter did not come up during an online summit between the prime ministers of the two countries on Friday, the Ministry of External Affairs said.At a special briefing after the summit, Vikas Swarup, Secretary (West) in the ministry, was asked whether the issue of Thunberg's comments on the farmers' protest was taken up by India with Sweden during the meeting."The answer is no. This is not a bilateral issue between India and Sweden," Swarup said.Last month, Thunberg had taken to Twitter to say, "We stand in solidarity with the #FarmersProtest in India."This was followed by another tweet a day later, in which she shared "a toolkit for those who want to help".While a number of international celebrities, including pop star Rihanna, had also tweeted in support of the farmers' protests, which entered its 100th day on Friday, the 'toolkit' matter became a major issue with the Delhi Police later registering FIRs against several people for allegedly trying to tarnish India's image.The 'toolkit' document, listed various actions, including creating a "Twitter storm" and protesting outside Indian embassies, to support the farmers' protest.In a statement, the MEA had said last month that some "vested interest groups" were trying to enforce their agenda on the protests and that a very small section of farmers in parts of the country has some reservations about the farm reforms which were passed by Parliament after a full debate and discussion.However, the Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM), an umbrella body of 41 farm unions spearheading the agitation, had welcomed the support extended by international personalities, saying it was a matter of pride that they are showing sensitivity towards the cause of farmers, but it was unfortunate that the government of India is not understanding their pain.Emphasising that the protests must be seen in the context of India's democratic ethos and polity, the MEA in its statement had said some vested interest groups have tried to mobilise international support against the country.Farmers, mostly from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, have been camping at several Delhi border points, including Tikri, Singhu and Ghazipur, since November 28, demanding a complete repeal of three farm laws and a legal guarantee on minimum support price (MSP) for their crops.The government has denied allegations that it was trying to put an end to the MSP and the mandi system. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has also assured farmers that the MSP would continue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gretas-comments-on-farm-stir-not-bilateral-issue-between-india-sweden-mea-101614963944704.html

Delhi, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh have been the newest additions, according to the Union health ministry. More than 84 per cent of the fresh cases that India recorded in the last 24 hours (16,838) are from these areas, it added.The overall Covid-19 curve in India has not seen a major rise in recent months and the vaccination drive, which began on January 16, is in full swing with the highest-single day doses administered to people on Friday. However, specific states and Union territories are experiencing a resurgence of the disease with authorities controlling the spread through lockdowns, night curfews, increased surveillance and testing.1. Maharashtra:Maharashtra continues to be the worst-hit state by the coronavirus pandemic across India. On Friday, 10,216 fresh cases and 53 more related deaths were recorded which pushed the caseload and death toll to 2,198,399 and 52,393 respectively. Friday’s tally has been the highest since mid-October last year. On March 3, 9,855 cases were added and were the highest in four months. The capital city of Mumbai added more than 1,100 cases for the third consecutive day on Friday.Maharashtra has been witnessing a rise in its daily Covid-19 tally since the second week of February—when the cases were near the 3,500-mark. The state government has resorted to lockdown restrictions or night curfews in districts such as Pune, Nashik, Amravati etc, which have been the fresh Covid-19 hotspots apart from Mumbai.2. Punjab:Punjab on Thursday recorded 1,074 Covid-19 disease cases—the highest in nearly five months. The caseload stands at 185,381 of which 5,887 people have died and more than 173,000 have recovered. Punjab had also seen the second-highest deaths (15) across the country on Thursday, according to the Union health ministry. The fresh resurgence of cases in the state has been happening for almost a month. Jalandhar, Shaheed Bhagat Singh (SBS) Nagar and Hoshiarpur continue to be the worst-hit districtsAs many as 173,658 healthcare and frontline workers have been administered the first vaccine dose so far while 44,306 of these workers have received the second dose. Punjab health minister had earlier appealed to all the Phase 1 beneficiaries of the vaccination drive to get inoculated and warned that cases were on the rise in the state and all precautions had to be taken.3. Madhya Pradesh:Madhya Pradesh has been the new addition to the list of states that are reporting an uptick in their daily coronavirus disease tally. Fresh cases in the state had remained below the 400-mark till March 4. However, on this day, 440 fresh cases and one more death were reported. The caseload is over 263,000 with 3,866 deaths and 256,116, as per the state health department’s bulletin. Indore and Bhopal have contributed the maximum towards Madhya Pradesh’s daily tally.Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan had said last week that the entire state would be brought under night curfew, if required, in order to curb the spread of the disease. He also advised everyone to strictly adhere to all Covid-related guidelines such as wearing masks, social distancing, etc.4. Gujarat:Gujarat on Friday added 515 new cases, which have been the highest in one and a half months, taking the caseload and 272,240, according to the state’s health department. One related death pushed the toll to 4,413. The last surge in Gujarat’s cases was last week when the daily infections crossed the 400-mark on February 25.The state government had on February 27 extended night curfew in four major cities—Ahmedabad, Surat, Vadodara and Rajkot—for another 15 days. Originally, this was supposed to end on February 28 but an official statement stated that the extension was done in view of the recent rise in cases.5. Delhi:The national capital on Friday added 312 cases in the last 24 hours, which have been the highest since last month. The daily cases in Delhi have increased since the last week of February. Three more deaths on Friday took the toll to 10,918.Delhi lieutenant governor Anil Baijal directed authorities on Friday to continue with the existing strategy against the disease amid the rise in several other states. Chairing a meet of the Disaster Management Authority, which was attended by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia and other ministers of the Delhi government and other officials of the Centre, Baijal reiterated the need to enhance vaccine coverage by specifically including digitally deficient and poorer sections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/5-states-see-fresh-spike-in-daily-cases-delhi-gujarat-mp-latest-additions-101614962710817.html
05-03-2021||India||SKM seeks judicial probe into Republic day tractor rally clashes in Delhi||The Samyukt Kisan Morcha on Friday sought a judicial probe into the violence that occurred on January 26 in Delhi during a tractor parade held by protesting farmers demanding the repeal of the Centre’s three contentious agriculture laws."We demand a high-level judicial probe into the incident that happened on January 26 where a peaceful 'kisan parade' was intentionally disrupted and the route was blocked under a deep-rooted conspiracy hatched by the Delhi Police at the instance of Union government," Morcha’s legal panel convener Prem Singh Bhangu said here.The Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM) is an umbrella body of 41 farmer unions protesting the farm laws.The SKM's legal panel also denounced the alleged repressive measures and violation of human rights by the Centre and the Delhi Police to foil the "peaceful" agitation of farmers at the borders of Delhi.Bhangu along with other members of the legal panel demanded immediate release of the farmers lodged in different jails of Delhi and withdrawal of "false cases" registered against farm leaders and farmers.The panel also demanded scrapping of notices being issued to farmers in Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and Uttrakhand "under the garb of joining investigation with intention to implicate them in false cases".More than 20 FIRs have been registered against suspected and unidentified persons in which police are intending to involve innocent people by issuing notices, Bhangu said.The legal penal called upon the farmers not to be afraid of the notices and repressive measures being taken by police and not to join the investigation and also not to respond to the notices.Bhangu said as on Friday, 125 farmers out of 151 have been released on bail and others are likely to be released as their bail applications are pending for hearing.The tractors and other vehicles which were illegally retained by police need to be released as early as early possible, he said.The legal panel is also considering to initiate legal action against police officers responsible for torture and causing injuries to farmers, Bhangu said.A tractor march meant to highlight farmers' demands was dissolved into anarchy on the streets of the national capital on January 26 as hordes of rampaging protesters broke through barriers, fought with police, overturned vehicles and delivered a national insult -- hoisting a religious flag from the rampart of Red Fort, a privilege reserved for India's Tricolour.Tens of thousands of protesters had clashed with police at multiple places, which led to chaos at well-known landmarks of Delhi and suburbs, amid waves of violence that ebbed and flowed through the day, leaving the farmers' two-month peaceful movement in tatters.Farmers, mostly from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, have been camping at several Delhi border points, including Tikri, Singhu and Ghazipur, since November 28, demanding a complete repeal of three farm laws and a legal guarantee on the minimum support price for their crops even as the Centre claimed that these were for the benefits of the farming community.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/skm-seeks-judicial-probe-into-republic-day-tractor-rally-clashes-in-delhi-101614961640724.html
05-03-2021||India||Top court reprieve for Kerala gold smuggling accused IAS officer M Sivasankar||The Supreme Court on Friday refused to interfere with the order granting bail to suspended Kerala bureaucrat M Sivasankar, who is accused in an alleged gold smuggling case being probed by the Enforcement Directorate.After the Kerala High Court granted bail to the former Principal Secretary to Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on January 25, the ED approached the top court to cancel his bail. Additional Solicitor General (ASG) SV Raju who appeared for the ED submitted that Sivasankar was a key conspirator who was faking sickness. He sought stay of the HC order which had clearly noted the prima facie guilt of the accused.The bench of Justices Ashok Bhushan and R Subhash Reddy issued notice to Sivasankar on ED’s plea but refused to stay the HC order. The bench enquired from the counsel for Sivasankar if he was already out of jail. Senior advocate Jaideep Gupta who appeared for Sivasankar told the court that he was in custody since October 28 last year and was released from jail following the HC order.“We will not put you in jail,” the bench remarked while rejecting ED’s request for his custody. The court noted that the HC found the accused to be suffering from serious ailments. Besides, there was nothing to show that he was involved in smuggling gold, the bench observed, adding that even the amount involving him was less than ₹one crore.The top court is expected to hear the matter after six weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/top-court-reprieve-for-kerala-gold-smuggling-accused-ias-officer-m-sivasankar-101614959826720.html

05-03-2021||India||On reports of Myanmar cops crossing over to India, MEA says ‘ascertaining facts’||Amid reports of several Myanmar policemen seeking refuge in India, the ministry of external affairs (MEA) said on Friday said it ascertaining facts and will revert with more details, reported news agency ANI. The remark by MEA spokesperson Anurag Srivastava comes in the backdrop of multiple reports suggesting personnel from Myanmar police have crossed over to India from the northeastern border to escape taking orders from a military junta that is trying to suppress protests against last month's coup. According to a home department official quoted by news agency PTI, 16 people of Myanmar have crossed over to the Indian side in recent days. "Of the 16 foreign nationals, 11 including a woman claimed they were police personnel of Myanmar. They possessed Myanmar citizen identity cards but it is hard to verify whether they belong to the police force or not," the official told PTI.Another official in Mizoram told news agency Reuters that people were slipping in despite intensive patrolling by Indian soldiers on the border along the Tiau river flowing between forested hills. "People are coming from different routes. The border is porous, you can't prevent it,” the official said.Earlier in the day, authorities in Mizoram said a team of officials is verifying the reports. Mizoram home minister Lalchamliana said that the men claiming to be policemen entered Serchhip district bordering Myanmar on Wednesday. “These men claim they are policemen. We have sent officials to verify their claims. They are yet to submit a report. It is very likely that the information is true,” the minister said.Following the alleged incident, India has stepped up security along the border with Myanmar, where the military overthrew a democratically elected government on February 1. "As of now, we are not letting anybody enter," Maria Zuali, a senior government official in Mizoram’s Champhai district, told Reuters. There is so far no word by Myanmar’s military on police defectors.Mizoram, which shares a 510km border with Myanmar, has been preparing for the event of a possible influx of refugees from the neighbouring nation in view of the growing dissent against the military coup. The Champhai administration has asked people to immediately report any information about Myanmarese nationals entering through the border to seek shelter. “If somebody crosses over without the notice of the district administration or village councils in border areas, those persons have to be caught and the local authorities alerted. They have to record entries of people who are not Indian nationals,” Zuali told HT.The army coup in Myanmar has triggered protests across the nation in which more than 50 people have died, according to reports.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/on-reports-of-myanmar-cops-crossing-over-to-india-mea-says-ascertaining-facts-101614957638968.html
05-03-2021||India||Women who stay at home contribute equally to India’s growth: Smriti Irani||Union minister for women and child development Smriti Irani said on Friday the conversation about women’s success centres only around those who are engaged in professional work. “When we appreciate a successful woman who gets out of the house, we should not ignore a woman who chooses to stay at home on her own free will. Such women also have an important contribution to the development of the country,” said Irani.Irani was speaking about ‘Women Power in Democracy', at the Indian Institute of Mass Communication in New Delhi. She also said that any talk on women power in a democracy only emphasises women serving in Parliament overlooking all the others engaged in different fields, who she said are contributors at the grassroots level.The minister cited an example from her life to pointed out that her ‘thinking, passion, and aspiration’ helped her achieve her goals. “I was raised in Gurugram, Haryana. At that time, if I had said that a girl born in a ‘tabela’ would cover the distance of 20km from Gurugram to Delhi in 40 years, people would have laughed at me. But I was confident that my thinking, passion, and aspiration could not stop a city boundary. I never saw the difficulties coming in the way as an obstacle. I saw this as a creative opportunity to find a solution,” she said.Talking about International Women’s Day on March 8, Irani stated that a woman’s struggles are not limited to just one day of the year therefore she should be celebrated throughout the year.Irani was delivering the ‘Friday Dialogue’ in IIMC, in the presence of director general Sanjay Dwivedi, students and the faculty. The address was a virtual interactive session where the minister also took questions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/women-who-stay-at-home-contribute-equally-to-india-s-growth-smriti-irani-101614957967626.html
05-03-2021||India||India steps up border patrols to stop arrivals from Myanmar||Indian security forces stepped up patrols on the border with Myanmar on Friday to stop refugees entering after some police officers crossed over to escape taking orders from the military junta there, officials said."As of now, we are not letting anybody enter," Maria Zuali, senior government official in Mizoram state's Champhai district, told Reuters by telephone.The move follows the defection over the border of some low-ranking Myanmar police officers who were unwilling to obey orders to suppress demonstrations against the junta.Myanmar's military overthrew a democratically elected government on Feb. 1, setting off nationwide protests that have left more than 50 people dead. A spokesman for the military has not commented on the police defectors.Indian soldiers and police were patrolling the frontier on Friday, Zauli said.In neighbouring Serchhip district, senior official Kumar Abhishek said eight people, including a woman and a child, had crossed the border and were being taken care of."We are anticipating that some more may come," he said.Authorities were making preparations to house between 30 and 40 people, he said.Asked about the crossing over of Myanmar police, Anurag Srivastava, spokesman for India's foreign ministry, told reporters at a briefing in New Delhi that it was ascertaining the facts.In all, about 30 Myanmar police and their family members had crossed over into India in recent days, a senior police official in Mizoram said, including some who had come overnight.The official, who requested anonymity, said people were slipping in despite intensive patrolling by Indian soldiers along a border that hugs the Tiau river flowing between forested hills."People are coming from different routes," the official said, "The border is porous, you can't prevent it."A federal Indian security official said that police crossing over had said they did not wish to carry out orders from the military to quell the protests."They alleged that there are human rights violations and they were asked to shoot at civilians," the official said, also requesting anonymity.The influx of such refuge-seekers, particularly police, puts India in a quandary because of New Delhi's close ties with the Myanmar military, known as the Tatmadaw.Over the last two years the Tatmadaw has mounted operations at India's request to flush out insurgents along the northeastern border. India, on its part, gifted Myanmar its first submarine last year."It's a little difficult situation for India because diplomatic balance is crucial," the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-steps-up-border-patrols-to-stop-arrivals-from-myanmar-101614953948949.html
05-03-2021||India||2500-year-old Egyptian mummy in Telangana museum gets a new life||A 2,500-year-old Egyptian mummy housed in the Telangana State Archaeology Museum in Hyderabad, which had been facing the threat of disintegration over years, has now been restored to a large extent and experts say there is no threat of any decay for at least another two to three decades.“The main reason for the decay of mummy was oxidation over a period of time. Based on the experts’ suggestions, the mummy was shifted from the wooden chamber into a glass chamber imported from Germany. The chamber is connected to a nitrogen supplier, which constantly supplies nitrogen and removes oxygen,” said B Ganga Devi, assistant director of the museum, who has been taking care of the mummy over the years.The 1.40-metre-long mummy, believed to be that of Nasihu, the daughter of the Sixth Pharaoh of Egypt of 2500 BC, has been on display at the state museum since 1930.The mummy was brought to Hyderabad by Nawab Nazeer Nawaz Jung, also known as Viqar-ul-Umrahi Paigah, the son-in-law of Mir Mahboob Ali Khan, the sixth Nizam of Hyderabad, around 1920. Nawaz Jung had bought it for 1,000 pounds in an open auction.“It was kept in the first floor of the now Chiran Fort in Begumpet for a long time, before it was gifted to Mir Osman Ali Khan, the seventh Nizam, who in turn donated it to the state museum in 1930,” heritage activist Mohammad Safiullah said.Till a couple of years ago, the mummy was on display in an airtight wooden enclosure with glass planks on sides. “Over the years, the wooden chamber became weakened exposing the mummy to air, posing a risk of getting decayed,” said B Ganga Devi.The embalmed body was getting fragmented around the face, shoulders and the feet. The wrapping around the body was getting peeled off and the cracks were very conspicuous at several places.Several efforts have been made over the last 10-12 years to restore the mummy. In August 2009, the YS Rajasekhara Reddy government (then CM of undivided Andhra Pradesh) summoned an expert in restoration of mummies from Egypt.“He made a preliminary study and went back. Some other experts from Supreme Council of Antiquities (SCA), Egypt, were also supposed to join him in taking up the restoration work, but the project did not take off following the sudden demise of Rajasekhara Reddy in September 2009,” an official in the department of archaeology, who refused to be quoted, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2500yearold-egyptian-mummy-in-telangana-museum-gets-a-new-life-101614955153374.html
05-03-2021||India||'Ensure disengagement at other friction points on LAC': India tells China again||India on Friday said it expects China to work jointly to ensure disengagement in the remaining friction areas along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Ladakh sector as this alone can set the stage for restoring normalcy in bilateral ties.The comments by external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava were a reiteration of the message conveyed by foreign minister S Jaishankar to his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi during a phone conversation on February 25.Following an agreement last month on pulling back frontline troops along with armoured vehicles and artillery from strategic heights around Pangong Lake, the two sides have been unable to make progress on disengagement at other friction points such as Depsang, Hot Springs and Gogra.Though the two foreign ministers agreed during their phone conversation on setting up a hotline to improve timely communications, differences remained on addressing the standoff on the LAC. Wang suggested the two sides should set aside the border issue, while Jaishankar insisted bilateral ties can be repaired only by completing disengagement at all friction points.“It is, therefore, our expectation that the Chinese side will work with us, both through the WMCC [Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination] and the senior [military] commanders’ meetings to ensure that disengagement in the remaining areas is completed at the earliest,” Srivastava told a regular news briefing.“This would allow both sides to consider de-escalation of forces in eastern Ladakh as that alone will lead to the restoration of peace and tranquillity and provide conditions for progress in our bilateral relationship,” he said.Srivastava pointed out that Jaishankar had told Wang during last week’s phone conversation that following the completion of disengagement in Pangong Lake area, “the two sides should now move quickly to resolve the remaining issues along the LAC in eastern Ladakh”.Details for establishing the hotline between the two foreign ministers will be worked out through diplomatic channels, he added.The senior military commanders, at their last meeting on February 20, had noted that the disengagement at Pangong Lake was a “significant step forward and it provided a good basis for the resolution of other remaining issues along the LAC in the western sector,” Srivastava added.The commanders had also had a detailed exchange of views on the remaining issues at their last meeting.Srivastava noted that Jaishankar had also pointed out to the Chinese foreign minister that “both sides have always agreed that maintenance of peace and tranquillity in the border area was an essential basis for the development of bilateral relations”.He added, “A prolongation of the existing situation was not in the interest of either side.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ensure-disengagement-at-other-friction-points-on-lac-india-tells-china-again-101614953296303.html
05-03-2021||India||In 7 points, India rebuts US NGO’s ‘partly free’ downgrade in democracy report||The Centre on Friday rebutted a stinging assessment of India’s democratic status by a US government-funded NGO that studies political freedom around the world, describing the conclusion that India’s status as a free country has declined to “partly free”, “is misleading, incorrect and misplaced”.The fact that many states were ruled by parties other than the one at the national level, “through an election process which is free and fair and which is conducted by an independent election body… reflects the working of a vibrant democracy, which gives space to those who hold varying views”, the government said, its first response to Freedom House’s annual report released this week, “Freedom in the World 2021 - Democracy under Siege”.The report downgraded India’s status as a democracy and free society to “partly free”, observing that New Delhi “appears to have abandoned its potential to serve as a global democratic leader”. It said India’s fall “from the upper ranks of free nations could have a particularly damaging impact on global democratic standards”.India’s score in Freedom House’s reports had declined over the last three years, from 77 in 2018 to 71 in 2020. The latest report changed India’s classification from “free” to “partly free”; India’s score was also reduced to 67 out of 100. The annual report is perceived as one of the oldest quantitative measures of democracy.Friday’s statement, issued by the ministry of information and broadcasting, focussed on seven points, responding to some concerns flagged by the democracy report that range from internet shutdowns and use of sedition law to what the report had referred to as discriminatory policies against Muslims in India and North East Delhi.Discrimination against MuslimsThe government said the Centre treats all citizens as equal as ‘enshrined’ under the Indian Constitution and all laws are applicable without any discrimination. Due process of law is followed in issues relating to law and order- irrespective of the alleged instigator’s identity. It also defended the handling of the Delhi riots that broke out last year over the controversial citizenship law, asserting that the law enforcement machinery acted quickly and in an impartial and fair manner. Appropriate actions were taken to control the situation.Use of sedition lawThe information and broadcasting ministry statement suggested that the decision to invoke the sedition law in specific cases was taken by the state government concerned as part of its mandate to maintain law and order. ‘Public Order’ and ‘Police’ are state subjects under the federal structure of governance. The state governments are primarily responsible for maintaining law and order in their respective areas which include investigation, registration and prosecution of crimes, protection of life and property. Hence, measures ‘deemed as fit’ are taken by law enforcement authorities in order to preserve public order, it added.Covid-19 lockdown ordered by CentreThe Centre also countered the NGO’s criticism for what it had described as “a ham-fisted lockdown that resulted in the dangerous and unplanned displacement of millions of internal migrant workers”. Friday’s statement released by the government highlighted that a majority of states had already ordered full or partial lockdown between March 16 to March 23 last year on the basis of their assessment of the Covid-19 pandemic in their respective areas. The statement said that the nationwide lockdown was ordered since any mass movement of people would have led to a rapid spread of the disease across the country. The Centre, it said, was ‘fully conscious’ that no one should face undue stress during the lockdown period, and it took several measures including allowing states to use disaster response funds to provide healthcare, food, shelter to the homeless and migrants; letting migrants work outside containment zones and announced a Rs. 1.7 lakh crore.On human rights organisationsThe government said the Indian Constitution provides for adequate safeguards under various laws for protection of human rights and pointed to the presence of human rights commissions at the national and state level as rights watchdogs.Intimidation of academics, journalistsThe government pointed out that the Centre had issued a special advisory to all states and union territories regarding the safety of journalists. It said the Indian constitution provides for freedom of expression under Article 19. Discussion, debate and dissent is a part of the country’s democracy, it said, stressing that the government attached the highest importance to the safety and security of all its residents including journalists.Internet shutdownsThe statement said that temporary suspension of internet and telecom services was ordered to maintain law and order and emphasised that the orders to shut internet could only be issued by the top home ministry official at the centre and in the state governments concerned. These orders are also reviewed by a panel headed by the cabinet secretary or the chief secretary, the top civil servant in the country and the state government, respectively.Freezing Amnesty International’s assetsAmnesty International had received permission to receive foreign funds under the foreign funding law FCRA only once and that too 20 years ago, the statement said. Since December 2000, Amnesty International, despite its repeated applications, has been denied FCRA approval by successive governments since as per law it is not eligible to get such an approval. However, in order to circumvent the FCRA regulations, Amnesty U.K. remitted large amounts of money to four entities registered in India, by misclassifying the remittance as Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), the I&B ministry statement said. A significant amount of foreign funds was also remitted to Amnesty India without MHA’s approval under FCRA, which the Centre said, was a malafide rerouting of money in contravention of the law. The statement recalled that the previous UPA government had also rejected Amnesty’s applications to receive foreign funds, that at one point, also led to the international human rights body to suspend its operations once .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/misleading-misplaced-govt-rebuts-freedom-house-report-on-democracy-in-india-101614954228863.html

He also launched an exclusive Twitter handle for the same.Jagan said the officials could make use of the platform and counter the propaganda with evidence. The CM also directed authorities to take action against individuals involved in such malicious activities.“No one has the right to damage the reputation of an individual or the system with mala fide intentions. There is a need to counter such malicious campaigns which are intended to mislead the people on the ambitious programmes of the government. People have to know the facts,” he said.The launch of the new portal follows the latest campaign on social media against the government accusing it of promoting Christianity thereby hurting the sentiments of the Hindus.“A couple of days ago, there was a systematic campaign in the social media by Bharatiya Janata Party leaders and sympathizers with the hashtag #Encroachment4ChristInAP, alleging that a huge cross was being erected on a hillock in Edlapadu, Guntur, where carvings of Hindu deities already exist,” a CMO official pointed out.BJP national secretary and co-incharge of Andhra Pradesh Sunil Deodhar took to Twitter claiming that the cross was being constructed where once footprints of Sita Maa and carving of Lord Narasimha existed. He also added that “Christian mafias” were creating havoc in the Guntur district, despite protests by RSS and the BJP cadre.The official handle of Guntur Rural district police promptly responded to his tweet, explaining the topography of the location through a video. Sub-Inspector of Edlapadu clarified that the hillock on which the cross was being erected is 500 metres away from the hillock on which the idol of Narasimha Swamy is present.“He also mentioned that no official complaint was lodged either with the police or the Revenue Department regarding the concern raised by the BJP member on social media,” the CMO official pointed out.Similarly, there were a few posts regarding the reduction in height of the Polavaram dam that went viral on social media. The posts claimed that Polavaram project height is being reduced from 45.72 meters to 41.1 meters.“Some media houses reported this speculation with heated debates, and posts appeared on social media with false information without any verified source. But during a review meeting on the progress of the Polavaram project chaired by the chief minister, the officials clarified that the works on the project were going as per the design that was cleared by Central Water Commission and Union Water Resources Ministry. There is no proposal of reducing the height of the dam,” he pointed out.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jagan-reddy-launches-fact-check-website-to-counter-fake-news-against-govt-101614953630408.html

The Prime Minister made the comments after receiving the prestigious CERAWeek Global Energy and Environment Leadership Award. “It is with great humility that I accept the CERAWeek Global Energy and Environment Leadership Award. I dedicate this award to the people of our great Motherland, India,” Modi said at the start of his address."This award recognises environmental leadership. It is commonly said that the best way to show is through action. There is no doubt that when it comes to caring for the environment, the people of India are the leaders, and it has been the case for centuries." the Prime Minister said while delivering the keynote address virtually.The Prime Minister suggested two ways to fight climate change and natural calamities. "One is through policies, laws, rules and orders. These have their own importance. For example, India is working to increase its share of natural gas from 6 per cent to 15 per cent by 2030. LNG is being promoted as fuel. We also launched a National Hydrogen Mission for use of hydrogen as a fuel. The second is behavioural change. It is the most powerful way to fight these challenges,” he added.As he called on people to change, PM Modi further remarked that by doing so the world will be a better place to live. "This spirit of behavioural change is a key part of our traditional habits which teach us consumption with compassion," he added.Referring to Mahatma Gandhi as one of the greatest environment champions, the Prime Minister said that people would not have the problems that they do today had humanity followed the path given by the Father of the Nation.It is with great humility that I accept CERAweek Global Energy & Environment Leadership Award. I dedicate this award to people of our great motherland India. I dedicate this award to glorious tradition of our land that has shown the way when it comes to caring for environment: PM pic.twitter.com/PiT05thzORThe Prime Minister also said that India’s forest cover had grown significantly over the last seven years and the population of lions, tigers, leopards and waterfowls went up during this time period. During 2020’s last Mann Ki Baat radio programme, he attributed the growth in forest cover to not only the Centre’s efforts but also to those who contributed towards forest and wildlife conservation.CERAWeek, which was founded in 1983 by American author and energy expert Dr Daniel Yergin, is organised every year since then and is regarded as the world’s premier annual energy platform. The leadership award was instituted in the year 2016 and aims towards recognising the future of global energy and environment, offering solutions and policies for energy access, affordability and environmental stewardship.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-receives-ceraweek-global-energy-and-environment-leadership-award-101614951191082.html

Senior Congress leader M Veerappa Moily, who had earlier stated that there was no stalemate in the talks and that differences would be sorted out, said his party was taking a firm stand on the matter. Asked what was the hurdle to the exercise, the senior leader said "negotiations are on. We will fight for a respectable number of seats to keep the morale of the Congress men very high," he told reporters here. The DMK, he said, was sure to realise this as there was a need for consolidation of secular forces in Tamil Nadu "It is necessary to defeat the divisive forces represented by the BJP-led NDA and Tamil Nadu is a strong platform to keep up the spirit of federalism and nationalism, he said. Earlier, Moily who was here to discuss the DMKs offer and way forward with the Tamil Nadu Congress Committee at the Congress headquarters Sathyamurthy Bhavan, had indicated that discussions with the DMK on sharing of seats would be resumed. On Thursday, the DMK had urged the Congress to resume talks after AICC in-charge of Tamil Nadu Dinesh Gundu Rao met TNCC leaders here and discussed the DMKs offer of seats which was not agreeable to the national party. The two rounds of discussions between DMK and Congress have remained inconclusive and party sources said Congress wanted a decent number of assembly seats.TNCC Chief K S Alagiri dismissed speculation that the party would walk out of the DMK-led alliance, saying it was a "making of the media." "We dont have faith on the third front. At present we are consulting our party members," he told reporters after meeting his party leaders. Confirming that discussions with DMK would resume, Moily said "it (talks) have not yet reached a stalemate... The differences will be sorted out." To a query on the group of 23 dissenting Congress leaders holding a separate meeting recently, he said "there is no such thing as G 23 or G 24." The Congress is totally united under the leadership of Sonia Gandhi and she has always heard grievances and taken action on them, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-will-fight-for-respectable-number-of-seats-from-dmk-veerappa-moily-101614950467326.html

Her family does not have any information regarding what the summon was about, he added.In a tweet Mufti said, "GOIs tactics to intimidate & browbeat political opponents to make them toe their line has become tediously predictable. They don’t want us to raise questions about its punitive actions & policies. Such short sighted scheming wont work."GOIs tactics to intimidate & browbeat political opponents to make them toe their line has become tediously predictable.They don’t want us to raise questions about its punitive actions & policies. Such short sighted scheming wont work .The case has been filed under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, news agency PTI reports citing officials.More details are awaited. The development comes days after her party unanimously re-elected her as the president of JKPDP, which was formed by Mufti’s father and former J&K chief minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed in 1999. She has been travelling to different regions of the Union territory to address meetings and gather new faces for the PDP. Despite defections of leaders to join a new political front led by Altaf Bukhari after the scrapping of Article 370, her party continues to stand strong in south Kashmir, which was reflected in the PDP’s win on 27 DDC seats in the recently concluded elections.Mufti was released last year after being detained from August 5, 2019, to October 13, 2020, following the revocation of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ed-summons-former-jammu-and-kashmir-chief-minister-mehbooba-mufti-in-money-laundering-case-on-march-15-officials-101614950429415.html
05-03-2021||India||UK knows urgency in Mallya's case, extradition linked to legal process: Envoy||The extradition of fugitive liquor baron Vijay Mallya from the UK is linked to the completion of a legal process that cannot be circumvented though Britain appreciates the urgency attached to such cases, British high commissioner Alex Ellis said on Friday.The UK home secretary signed off on Mallya’s extradition to India more than two years ago but his return to India has been held up because of secret legal proceedings, according to the British government. Mallya is learnt to have applied for asylum in the UK.Asked about Mallya’s case at his first news briefing since taking over as the British envoy last month, Ellis said Britain appreciates the “urgency and importance” attached to such matters and the “desire to get people who are accused of corruption back to India”.Extradition is a mix of administrative and judicial processes and the UK home secretary “has done what the home secretary needs to do from the executive’s point of view in the case of Vijay Mallya but that is part of a judicial process and our courts work their way through those processes,” Ellis said.“There’s a process going on...it’s a legal process and that has to be followed through, can’t short-cut that. That’s why you have legal processes,” he said.The 65-year-old businessman is wanted in India to face charges of defrauding a consortium of banks of more than a billion dollars in relation to the collapse of Kingfisher Airlines in 2013.In response to another question, Ellis said the UK hopes the case of Christian Michel, a British national accused of being the middleman in the AgustaWestland VVIP helicopter deal, would be resolved as speedily as possible.Michel has been held in India since December 2018 after he was extradited from the United Arab Emirates. Reports have suggested that a report by UN experts, which is set to be released soon, has concluded that Michel was arbitrarily detained and should be immediately released.Ellis said the UK is doing everything necessary in a consular case involving a British national, including supporting Michel and providing consular assistance to his family.“We hope and want to have...a swift resolution of the case. It’s for the Indian judicial process to work out what should happen. That’s not our business, but obviously we want things to move as quickly as they can,” he said.The British envoy also acknowledged that discussions were going on between UK-based Cairn Energy and the Indian government after the Permanent Court of Arbitration at The Hague last year awarded the firm $1.2 billion in damages in a retrospective taxation case.“There’s been a ruling made by the arbitration panel, an unanimous ruling. Now we have to see what happens next and...we encourage both parties to reach a swift settlement,” Ellis said.Ellis noted that India has “huge ambitions about infrastructure and the transformation which needs to take place in the country”, and pointed out that such a goal requires both domestic and foreign capital, and “creating an environment in which foreign capital comes to the country”.People familiar with developments said recently that the Indian government’s tax amnesty scheme, Vivad Se Vishwas, is a viable option within the legal framework for amicably resolving retrospective tax litigation with two foreign firms, Cairn Energy and Vodafone Group that together involve a sum of at least ₹30,000 crore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uk-knows-urgency-in-mallya-s-case-extradition-linked-to-legal-process-envoy-101614947694897.html

The SFDR technology will help DRDO with the technological advantage to develop long-range air-to-air missiles (AAMs).DRDO in a statement also said that only a handful of countries have such a technology. It said that the test was carried out using a booster motor to simulate an air-launch scenario. The nozzle-less booster propelled the missile to the required Mach number for Ramjet operation.“The performance of the missile was monitored using the data captured by Electro Optical, Radar and Telemetry instruments deployed by ITR and confirmed successful demonstration of the mission objectives. The launch was monitored by senior scientists of various DRDO labs, including Defence Research & Development Laboratory (DRDL), Research Centre Imarat (RCI) and High Energy Materials Research Laboratory(HEMRL),” DRDO said in its statement.According to a report by the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), Ramjet powered missiles provide greater range and a higher average speed compared to missiles powered by solid propellants. The report also said that ramjet missiles use atmospheric oxygen rather than including an oxidizer as part of the solid motor. Another report on the website Popular Mechanics points out that ramjet missiles can carry a bigger warhead as they do not have to carry an oxidizer.DRDO began developing SFDR first in 2017 and had conducted successful tests in 2018 and 2019 as well. After Friday’s successful testing, defence minister Rajnath Singh congratulated scientists of DRDO, the Indian Air Force (IAF) and the defence industry. Satheesh Reddy, DRDO’s chairperson, also applauded the team after the successful testing of the SFDR technology.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/drdo-successfully-tests-sfdr-technology-in-a-bid-to-develop-long-range-missiles-101614947414299.html

The structure, called Bailey bridge, was inaugurated on Thursday."We have inaugurated 200-feet-long Bailey bridge for traffic movement. The bridge has been built in eight days," BRO's chief engineer AS Rathore told news agency ANI.The bridge is located in Raini village, in Tapovan area of Chamoli district, which was affected the most by the flash flood caused by glacier burst. The Rishiganga Hydropower Project, which was being built in the area, was washed away along with a dam.Also watch: How people of Raini village first warned people of glacier breachAnother hydroelectic project was also swept away in the tragedy in which more than 70 people were killed and over 200 are still missing.The flood was triggered after a chunk of a glacier - which experts said was 15 football fields long and five across - broke off from the main structure and fell into a small river.The roaring deluge of water, rocks and soil hurtled down the V-shaped valley in the mountainous region, sweeping away homes, roads and bridges.Many expert blamed climate change for this tragedy, but locals also highlighted the rampant construction going on in the ecologically fragile area.A group of experts formed by the government said on Wedesday that the February 7 flood not "immediately" a human-induced disaster. The scientists of Defence Geo-Informatics Research Establishment - a premier research body under the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) - said that global warming and heating up of the Himalayas could be the main reasons for the glacial breach in Chamoli district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bridge-in-uttarakhand-washed-away-in-flash-flood-rebuilt-in-8-days-101614947346562.html

(But) since the names were taken, (I want to say) the very same names were raided in 2013," she said in an interaction with journalists at IWPC (Indian Women's Press Corps).It "wasn't an issue (in 2013). It's an issue now," she said.She, however, did not talk about the outcome of the 2013 raids and if any follow-up action was taken in the last seven years.The Income Tax Department on March 3 began raids on the homes and offices of Pannu and Kashyap as well as his partners, who launched the now-shuttered production house Phantom Films.The searches, part of a tax evasion probe against Phantom Films, carried out across 30 locations in Mumbai and Pune, also covered Reliance Entertainment group CEO Shibhasish Sarkar and some executives of celebrity and talent management companies KWAN and Exceed.Asked to comment on the raids, Sitharaman spoke of the 2013 raids not being an issue and they suddenly become one now."Answer it for the hypocrisy or answer it, saying from then this is happening till now, what's the matter (with now)," she said. "In the national interest, do we want to know if there is some evasion happening."Pannu and Kashyap are both known to be outspoken in their views on a range of issues."I don't know. I am not commenting on a particular case. But if that relates to particular names I want to ask - should we raise questions whether there was a serious omission and commission or should we raise a question about 'oh it's happening now'?" Sitharaman said. "Please look back. It happened in 2013."The tax department in a statement on Thursday stated that search and survey operations were carried out in Mumbai, Pune, Delhi and Hyderabad."During the search, evidence of huge suppression of income by the leading film production house compared to the actual box office collections has been unearthed," it had said, referring to Kashyap's venture. "The company officials have not been able to explain the discrepancy of around ₹300 crore.""Evidence related to manipulation and under-valuation of share transactions of the production house amongst the film directors and shareholders, having tax implication of about ₹350 crore has been found and is being further investigated," it had said, adding "evidence" of cash receipts by the actor amounting to ₹5 crore had been recovered.Tax department sources said some inter-linked transactions between the entities searched are under the scanner of the department. The raids, they added, are aimed at gathering more evidence to further probe tax evasion allegations against them.Founded in 2011, Phantom Films produced films such as "Lootera", "Queen", "Ugly", "NH 10", "Masaan" and "Udta Punjab". However, it was disbanded seven years later. Kashyap later launched a new production company called Good Bad Films.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/it-raids-on-taapsee-anurag-kashyap-sitharaman-says-they-were-raided-in-2013-as-well-101614945782081.html

It is scheduled to come up for hearing later Friday.The ED has alleged that Abdullah "misused" his position as president of the Jammu and Kashmir Cricket Association (JKCA) from 2001-2011 and made appointments in the sports body so Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) sponsored funds could be laundered. Abdullah said the list of properties attached by the ED in Kashmir and in Jammu were unrelated to the alleged criminal activity mentioned in the Final Report/FIR and termed it a "continuing violation of his fundamental rights".According to party MP Hasnain Masoodi, the properties were either ancestral or acquired before the alleged offence took place and were therefore not involved in any money-laundering or related criminal activity. Abdullah raised the validity of the ED in the case. He said in his petition that on the date of the registration of the ECIR (Enforcement Commission Information Report) and the initiation of investigation, the state of Jammu and Kashmir was governed by the Constitution of Jammu and Kashmir, 1956, and had special status under Article 370 of the Constitution of India. He said the ED registered the case on December 28, 2018, under the Ranbir Penal Code (the Indian Penal Code’s substitute in the erstwhile state) without ascertaining whether it had any jurisdiction to do so. On December 19, 2020 the ED issued a provisional order attaching the properties under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). An appeal could be filed before the adjudicating authority of the PMLA within a six-month period. According to an ED statement, the attached properties include three residential houses -- at Gupkar Road in Srinagar, Katipora Tehsil in Tanmarg and Bhatindi in Sunjwan village of Jammu. "A commercial building at posh Residency Road in Srinagar has also been attached besides lands at four different places in JK," the agency had said. While the book value of the attached properties is ₹11.86 crore, their market value is estimated to be about ₹60-70 crore, officials said. The 84-year-old NC patron has been questioned by the ED in the case several times, the last in October 2020 at Srinagar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farooq-abdullah-questions-ed-order-in-alleged-money-laundering-case-101614944474474.html

The resolution, which was moved by chief minister Amarinder Singh, called the three laws "unacceptable for the farmers as well as the Punjab government".The chief minister said that the three laws are detrimental to the farmers. He also appealed to the Centre to withdraw all cases and notices against the farmers who have been sitting on protest demanding repeal of the laws. Singh said that this is needed to build a "congenial environment for an amicable solution"."The farmers have never done anything anti-national, they are not anti-national, and they will never do anything against the unity and integrity of this country. They are patriotic and nationalistic," said Singh.The resolution was passed by voice vote.Earlier, the members of the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) created uproar in the assembly when the chief minister was replying to the Governor's address. Singh then lashed out at SAD, saying both Sukhbir Badal and Harsimrat Badal brazenly cheated the people of Punjab with their double-speak on the farm laws.There were several appeals from the speaker K P Singh to the SAD members to let the proceedings continue, but the members refused to listen to him. The speaker adjourned the House twice, but the uproar continued when it reconvened.When the Akalis continued to shout slogans in the well of the House, the Speaker first named all the members of SAD and suspended them for the remaining part of the session.He even asked the watch and ward staff of the assembly to remove them from the House. Marshals then evicted the suspended MLAs from the House.The budget session of Punjab assembly will continue till March 10.In October last year, Punjab became the first country to pass a resolution formally rejecting Centre's contentious farm laws. It also passed an amendment removing Punjab from the ambit of these laws. Thousands of farmers have been protesting near Delhi against the Centre's farm laws since November 26 last year. As their stir completes 100 days on Saturday, the protesters gave planned a blockade of a key expressway near the national capital.

05-03-2021||India||Pandemic-induced job losses ate up ₹13 lakh crore of household income: Report||Households have lost a whopping ₹13 lakh crore of their incomes from the pandemic-induced job losses, according to a report that also warns of the economy losing momentum by mid-2021 on a likely slowdown in consumption demand that has propped the economy in recent months.Describing the growth momentum seen in second and third quarters of FY21 as a positive surprise, economists at UBS Securities India led by Tanvee Gupta Jain said the economy could slow by mid-2021 as households that lost incomes during the pandemic to the tune of ₹13 lakh crore could drag consumption with a lag.In the second quarter of the current financial year, GDP contraction narrowed to 7.5%; while in Q3, it grew 40 basis points (bps) as compared with a 23.9% contraction in the first quarter.Given this, sustainability of the recovery seen in the second and third quarters and also the growth outlook are dependent on the revival in new investment intentions and easing of financial sector stress.The report, based on a one-day virtual macro tour that the brokerage had with experts, attributes the strong growth rebound seen so far to pent-up consumption, and a surge in investment activity, primarily investment projects committed before the pandemic but getting completed now.Though general economic activity is back to the pre-pandemic level, the key question is if this growth momentum can be sustained as the composite economic indicator has plateaued in January after recovering swiftly in the prior two quarters.Therefore, the prognosis for the March quarter appears to be softening of the momentum, according to the report.However, the counter-cyclical fiscal policy in the Budget focuses on higher capex (2.5% of GDP, which is the highest since FY08 and up from 1.7% in the previous year), which will help boost the nascent economic recovery. The multiplier impact of higher capital expenditure (capex) is 2.5 times higher than revenue expenditure.The report also warns that the perceived revival in the realty sector is mostly driven by record low mortgage rates (as low as 6.6% at SBI), state incentives and pent-up demand.Housing sales shrank 31% in 2020 as against 2019 in terms of value and unit sales, while new property sales are only 16 per cent of the total so far.As the public debt-to-GDP ratio set to rise to 90 in 2021-22 from 72 before the pandemic, the general view is that the country's debt sustainability hinges on its ability to maintain and improve its potential growth.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pandemicinduced-job-losses-ate-up-rs-13-lakh-crore-of-household-income-report-101614943776737.html

05-03-2021||India||As China eyes Taiwan and beyond, Quad's Indo-Pacific agenda takes priority||Leaders of the four-nation Quad grouping that seeks to counter Beijing will meet this month to work together for peace, prosperity and stability of the Indo-Pacific, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced on Friday against the backdrop of an increasingly assertive China under President Xi Jinping unveiling plans to tighten its grip on Hong Kong and building a high-speed railway and expressway linking Beijing and Taipei.The meeting of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, or Quad, will be US President Joe Biden’s first interaction under the diplomatic and security initiative that was revived during the Donald Trump era as a buffer against Beijing in 2017. Foreign ministers of the four countries met last month to prepare for the meeting of the heads of government in March.That the Biden administration has taken steps to hold the first Quad Summit within months of taking over demonstrates that the security relationship has been institutionalised. The Biden administration has made it clear right at the beginning of his term that he would work more closely with other countries including Quad members to strengthen partnerships as part of its strategy on China.This would include deepening the partnership among Quad countries, not just as an anti-China platform but a convergence of democratic powers to back the rule of law. The four powers will also coordinate to express their position in UNSC through the US as P-5 and India as a non-permanent member, and look at forming an economic platform in the future through common interests.China watchers in New Delhi said the backdrop of the Quad meeting was crucial given how, over the last few days and weeks, Beijing had made it clear that it intended to go all out to consolidate its control over Hong Kong and Taiwan and assert its footprint in the South China Sea where it has territorial disputes with almost all neighbours.As things stand, Indian officials do not expect any dramatic change in Xi Jinping’s approach towards India. Chinese troops had triggered friction at multiple points along the border in Ladakh last year that led to casualties on both sides in June 2020, a new low in relations between the two giants in over 40 years.Last month, the two countries finally decided to disengage their troops from one part of the border. But China appears less-than-enthusiastic to expand this understanding to troops in other parts of the Line of Actual Control including the Gogra-Hot Springs and Depsang bulge area. At the same time, the Indian army formations in the east have flagged efforts by the People’s Liberation Army to carry out rapid infrastructure upgrades across two Indian states, Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh.On Friday, Prime Minister Li Keqiang signalled that the Chinese efforts to strengthen the military would continue as he announced a defence budget of 1.35 trillion yuan ($208.47 billion) for the military, the second-largest in the world after the US. China’s defence budget - it is nearly three times India’s military budget - is expected to grow by a little less than 7% over the previous year.Experts believe China’s defence budget understates the actual military expenditure - it does not include the billions poured into research and development to develop an array of weapons including fighter jets - but is tracked closely as an indicator of the direction and pace of the Chinese military investment.“We will boost military training and preparedness across the board, make overall plans for responding to security risks in all areas and for all situations, and enhance the military’s strategic capacity to protect the sovereignty, security and development interests of our country,” Premier Li was quoted as saying in a government translation of his remarks.Indian strategists believe that China’s growing defence budget under Xi Jinping would put pressure on New Delhi to raise military spending also in view of the Ladakh friction. India has already increased the budget to buy weapons and systems by 20% this year to catch up with China.India has also been cementing its defence cooperation with countries outside Quad as well. Next month, India’s INS Vikramaditya will exercise with France’s nuclear-powered Charles de Gaulle aircraft carrier strike force in two phases in the Arabian Sea and the Indian Ocean.This week, the Indian Air Force started participating in the annual multinational air exercise hosted by the United Arab Emirates. Exercise Desert Flag, being held at UAE’s Al-Dhafra airbase, also has air forces from the United States, France, Saudi Arabia, South Korea and Bahrain.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/as-china-eyes-taiwan-and-beyond-quad-s-indo-pacific-agenda-takes-priority-101614941573506.html

In November last year, he tweeted to say that Congress needs a 'bold move' and demanded that Vadra should contest the Kanyakumari bypoll."We need a bold move. Something which will fire up the imagination of the @INCIndia worker. @priyankagandhi must contest the Kanyaumari Parliamentary seat election which is likely to be announced shortly. @INCTamilNadu It will be an overwhelming victory for her/party/alliance," Chidambaram said on Twitter.The assembly election in Tamil Nadu will be held in a single phase on April 6, the Election Commission announced on February 26.

05-03-2021||India||At virtual summit with Sweden, PM Modi says ‘climate change a priority’||Prime Minister Narendra Modi held a virtual interaction with his Swedish counterpart Stefan Lofven on Friday where the two leaders discussed bilateral ties and called for further cooperation on climate change.Modi put spotlight on the nation’s achievements in the power sector in the recent years, and said, “India's renewable power capability has increased by 162% in the last five years.” He added that India was among the only countries in G20 which has stood by its commitment.Sharing an example, the Prime Minister said, “By promoting the use of LED lights, we are saving 38 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions. Modi told the summit that India has set a target of installing 450 GW of renewable energy by 2030.The Prime Minister also hailed India’s role in the global fight against the coronavirus pandemic. “We have also provided 'Made in India' vaccines to about 50 countries so far,” he said in his address at the summit, adding that India is committed to supplying the shots to more countries in the coming days.Modi also expressed grief over the attack in the Swedish city of Vetlanda on Wednesday, which the police suspected to be a terrorist crime. “Those injured in the attack will be fully recovered soon, this is our wish,” he told Lofven.The Prime Minister held that shared values like democracy, human rights, rule of law, equality, freedom, justice strengthen India and Sweden’s relations and mutual cooperation.This was the fifth interaction between the two leaders since 2015. Modi had visited Stockholm in April 2018 for the first India Nordic Summit while Löfven came to India in February 2016 for the special Make in India week.The two leaders had earlier met on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in September 2015 and in April, 2020, they had a telephonic conversation to discuss the situation arising out of the Covid-19 pandemic, the Prime Minister’s Office said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/at-virtual-summit-with-sweden-pm-modi-says-climate-change-a-priority-101614939655852.html

The Maoists, who were camping there for a meeting, triggered a landmine explosion, in which at least one commando was injured, as per reports.A fierce battle was taking place between the rebels and the elite security squad in the area. The district police headquarters has sent a helicopter to bring the injured commando for treatment, along with additional personnel with arms and ammunition. Besides, a large number of paramilitary forces, along with state police, were sent to the spot to help the C-60 squad, reports said.The Deputy Inspector General of Police (DIG) Gadchiroli range, Sandeep Patil said that the commandos successfully destroyed a mini arms and ammunition factory near the blast site. “The operation in the area to flush out Maoists is still on-going,” he said and suspected some casualties on the side of militants.Neighbouring Chhattisgarh government was also sending security forces to the spot on Maharashtra's request so that the Maoists can be dealt with firmly. Senior police officials have also rushed to the spot, the reports further said.Also Read: Bihar police books landowners for illegal opium cultivation to check the menaceOn February 23, a Maoist camp was destroyed and an ambush against security forces was foiled by police in Gadchiroli district and two days later on February 25, security forces busted seven Maoist hideouts and recovered a huge cache of explosives during a three-day operation along the Chhattisgarh- Maharashtra border, according to the police.

Citizens attributed the result to a range of factors – from the safety of women to communal harmony to the presence of an active civil society.“Life is peaceful in Chennai,” Nanditha Krishna, president of C P Ramaswami Aiyar Foundation, said.“We often hear about riots and lynchings in other parts of the country. It is good to see none of it in Chennai. It is also a lot safer for women. Travelling late night isn’t a problem unlike in Delhi,” Krishna, who is an author, historian, environmentalist and a recipient of the Centre’s Nari Shakti Puraskar 2015, said.She added: “The lifestyle here is laid-back which is important because you don’t always have to be in a rush to board trains like in Mumbai. It isn’t too expensive for a middle-class person. Indulging in music, dance and fine arts is a part of one’s culture here.”The resilience here is often listed as a top quality, particularly in terms of the civil society’s management and relief work during the 2015 floods and the Covid-19 pandemic.CheChennai’s IT-corridor along the expanded parts of the city in Old Mahabalipuram (OMR) is a mix of employees from across the country as well as those from Japan and Korea.In terms of the “mobility index”, the city’s performance has been “driven by the large presence of its public transport system,” the survey said, putting it down as the best in the country. The survey attributed this to Chennai’s well-connected and economical public transport system.“Chennai is one of the few cities in the country that is largely connected with a high frequency in its public transport system of buses. This is well complemented by the suburban railways, metro and MRTS,” Awasthy Dilip, senior programme manager of Institute of Transportation and Development Policy (ITDP), said.In 2014, the Greater Chennai Corporation adopted a non-motorised transport system policy.“Over the last five years, Chennai has prioritized pedestrians, cyclists and public transport users,” Dilip said.“More than 100 km of streets have been made safe for pedestrians. The city has piloted a pedestrian plaza at T Nagar, a parking management system and connectivity to public transportation through cycle-sharing systems, including electric cycles. These are difficult initiatives which see push back but it’s a great step for Chennai to test these initiatives. We are in a good place but we need to improve and do way better.”The results are a reflection of development projects combined with sustainable efforts, the state government said.“Improving solid waste management is a key component of the city corporation,” Harmandar Singh, principal secretary for Tamil Nadu municipal administration and water supply, said.“Chennai is innovative in energy conservation. We are good at reusing treated water, recycling and upcycling waste. Economic ability is the only area where we are slightly low because they’re accounting for cluster-based economic development which is outside the city where we have automobile facilities,” Singh added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chennai-fourth-best-city-to-live-in-coimbatore-secures-seventh-spot-101614939845393.html
05-03-2021||India||No provision in regulations to take action against digital platforms: SC||The Supreme Court Friday said the Centre's guidelines on regulating social media do not have any provision for taking appropriate action against digital platforms showing inappropriate content.It also granted protection from arrest to Amazon Prime Video's India head Aparna Purohit in FIRs lodged over web series Tandav.A bench comprising justices Ashok Bhushan and RS Reddy also issued notice to the Uttar Pradesh government on Purohit's plea for anticipatory bail in FIRs on Tandav series.The apex court observed that the Centre's regulations on social media are mere guidelines and do not have provision for any action against digital platforms.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Centre, said the government will consider appropriate steps and any regulation or legislation on it will be placed before court.The apex court also directed Purohit to make Centre as a party to her plea.Tandav is a nine-episode political thriller starring Bollywood A-listers Saif Ali Khan, Dimple Kapadia and Mohd Zeeshan Ayyub.Purohit has been accused of inappropriate depiction of Uttar Pradesh police personnel, Hindu deities and an adverse portrayal of a character playing the prime minister in the web series.The top court had on Thursday observed that some over-the-top (OTT) platforms at times show pornographic contents and there should be a mechanism to screen such programmes.It had asked the Centre to place its guidelines on regulating social media.Mehta had said he would be placing on records the Information Technology (Guidelines for intermediaries and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021.Senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, appearing for Purohit, had on Thursday termed the FIRs against her as “shocking” saying that this woman is an employee of Amazon and she is neither a producer nor an actor but still she has been made an accused in around 10 cases relating to the web series across the country.Earlier, the apex court, on January 27, had declined to grant interim protection from any coercive action to Ali Abbas Zafar, Director of the web series, Purohit, producer Himanshu Mehra, the show's writer Gaurav Solanki and actor Mohammed Zeeshan Ayyub.It had said that they may seek bail from courts concerned in the FIRs lodged in connection with the web series.Now, Purohit has appealed to the top court against the Allahabad High Court's February 25 order declining anticipatory bail to her.A single judge bench of the High Court had said that Purohit had not been “vigilant and has acted irresponsibly making her open to criminal prosecution in permitting streaming of a movie which is against the fundamental rights of the majority of citizens of this country and therefore, her fundamental right of life and liberty cannot be protected by grant of anticipatory bail to her in the exercise of discretionary powers of this court.”While rejecting the plea, the high court had said that the applicant was earlier granted interim protection from arrest by another bench in a similar case but she was not cooperating with the investigation.The high court had observed, "Western filmmakers have refrained from ridiculing Lord Jesus or the Prophet but Hindi filmmakers have done this repeatedly and are still doing this most unabashedly with Hindu gods and goddesses.""This tendency on the part of the Hindi film industry is growing and if not curbed in time, it may have disastrous consequences for the Indian social, religious and communal order,” the high court had observed.On January 19, 2021, an FIR was lodged on the complaint of one Balbir Azad of Raunija village under Rabupura police station of Greater Noida.In the complaint, Azad alleged that the show depicted Uttar Pradesh and its police in a poor light.The complaint further alleged that the web series had deliberately denigrated Hindu gods and goddesses.Several other FIRs have also been lodged in states like Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Bihar and Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-provision-in-regulations-to-take-action-against-digital-platforms-sc-101614936566411.html

To mark the day, farmers are planning to block a major expressway outside New Delhi tomorrow.The protesting farmers will block the six-lane Western Peripheral Expressway, also known as Kundli–Manesar–Palwal (KMP) Expressway for five hours, from 11 am to till 4 pm, Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM) announced on Wednesday. The SKM is spearheading the farmers' agitation along with Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU)."We believe that after these 100 days, our movement will put a moral pressure on the government to accede to our demands, because the weather will also worsen," news agency Reuters quoted SKM spokesperson Darshan Pal as saying. "It will weaken the government, which will have to sit down with us to talk again," he further said."The laws are like a death warrant to us," said Pal, adding, "We are prepared for the long haul."Tens of thousands of farmers are camping at the Delhi borders to protest against the three farm laws termed historic by the Centre. In these 100 days, the farmers have braved harsh weather conditions but remained firm on their demands. They want the repeal of the contentious laws and a legal guarantee on minimum support price (MSP).The protesting farmers claim that the new laws will weaken the MSP system. The Centre, however, has touted the laws as long-needed reforms in the agriculture sector and says it will bring investment to the market. The government has also assured that the MSP system will remain as it is.However, farmers fear that it will leave them at the mercy of the big corporates and will end the 'mandi system,' where farmers are assured of a minimum price for their produce.Multiple rounds of talks have taken place between the government and the farm leaders, but so far it has failed to end the deadlock.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-stir-to-complete-100-days-on-march-6-expressway-blockade-planned-to-mark-the-occasion-101614937211072.html
05-03-2021||India||Goa: BJP relieves state spokesperson as dissension deepens in Panaji unit||The Goa BJP has relieved a party spokesperson of responsibilities as it deals with a widening rift within the ranks of its Panjim unit ahead of the upcoming Panaji city corporation polls.Party spokesperson Dattaprasad Naik, who joined hands with former MLA Siddharth Kuncalienker, and Utpal Parrikar, the son of former chief minister Manohar Parrikar, has been relieved of his responsibilities, state party president Sadanand Shet Tanavade said in a communique.The move comes after Naik, Kuncalienker and Utpal fielded their own set of candidates in some of the seats for the polls, claiming it was their responsibility as citizens to back ‘good’ candidates for the polls.Municipal elections in Goa are not held on party lines but political parties announce their ‘panels’ of candidates that are often backed by the local MLA.In the case of Panaji, the BJP lost its hold of the state capital -- a seat former chief minister Manohar Parrikar represented for five terms, barring the period he was the country’s union defence minister, until his death in 2018 -- to the Congress candidate Atanasio Monserrate in the bye-elections to the seat.A few months later, Monserrate along with nine other Congress MLAs jumped ship to the BJP and it is he, with the backing of the state party leadership, who is now calling the shots with the BJP-backed panel in the city.Utpal admitted he was breaking ranks with the party but stopped short of saying he was rebelling against the party.“My stand is clear. I have given support to individuals on a personal level. My support is personal as a citizen. I have raised objections with the party president,” Utpal announced at a press conference.“If I wanted to rebel, I would have rebelled at the time of assembly elections. Many people quit the party after being denied a ticket. I did not.

Petitioner Santa Khurai, a Manipur-based Nupi Maanbi (traditional identity within the trans umbrella), challenged the constitutionality of clauses 12 and 51 of the guidelines that bar persons of gender and sexual minority groups as well as female sex workers from donating blood as they are “at risk” for sexually transmitted diseases like HIV (Human immunodeficiency virus), Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C. Also Read | Supreme Court issues notice to Centre regarding soldier missing since 1997The petitioner pointed out that the effect of these guidelines was felt the most during the past year when transgender persons were unable to donate blood to other members of their community during emergencies, and blood banks were also running low on supplies on account of fewer donations during the pandemic. “The exclusion of transgender persons, men having sex with men and female sex workers from being blood donors and permanently prohibiting them from donating blood solely on the basis of their gender identity and sexual orientation is completely arbitrary, unreasonable and discriminatory, and also unscientific,” the petition stated. “The guidelines need to be based on an individualized system for all donors based on actual and not perceived risk, and should not be based on identities,” the petitioner submitted. A three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde issued notice to the Union Health Ministry, National Blood Transfusion Council and National AIDS Control Organization (NACO) but refused to stay the guidelines. “These are medical matters. We don’t understand it. We are not going to enter areas without understanding them,” the bench comprising Justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian, stated. Arguing for the petitioner, advocate Jayana Kothari pointed out that the guidelines perpetuated stigma and furthered the discriminated faced by communities and persons based on their gender identities and sexual orientation. “We have sought a change in the guidelines which are based on bands of identity, which is discriminatory, rather than on risky behaviour, which is not identity-based,” she said. All blood units collected from donors were tested for infectious diseases including Hepatitis B and C as well as for HIV. Thus, such permanent exclusion on the basis of identity-based categories is “violative of the right to be treated equally as other blood donors,” the plea stated. “The prohibition amounts to discrimination under Article 14 (right to equality) and Article 15 (right against discrimination) of the Constitution, as it deems them less worthy of social participation and healthcare,” said advocate Anindita Pujari who filed the petition. The guidelines came into force in 2017, but the bar on blood donation is decades-old, said L Ramakrishnan from the public health non-government organisation Solidarity and Action Against the HIV Infection in India (SAATHII) that works with communities marginalized on account of their HIV status and/or gender and sexuality. “Grouping entire populations as High Risk Groups (HRG) and ineligible for blood donations has two issues. One is that it perpetuates the social stigma already surrounding these populations. The other is that blood may donated by individuals who do not belong to these HRGs, but may still engage in high-risk behaviour. Given the acute need for blood donors in this country it makes more sense to move away from blanket bans but look at individualized risk similar to the new guidelines proposed in the United Kingdom, and to ensure that all blood is tested using advanced technologies that can detect HIV even when the viral load is low,” Ramakrishnan said. The ban on blood donation by gender and sexual minority groups is a legacy of the AIDS pandemic that began in the 1980s and spread across the world, including in India, prompting the setting up of NACO and a phased-wise response to prevent the spread of HIV. However, several countries, including the UK and Brazil, have replaced these bans. In the UK, all men can give blood three months after engaging in sexual intercourse with another man. Earlier, they had to wait for a year from their last encounter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-seeks-centre-response-on-barring-transgenders-gay-people-from-donating-blood-101614936356466.html

The IISC team, lead by Utpal Tatu, a professor in the Department of Biochemistry, found 27 mutations in three isolates of SARS-CoV-2 with over 11 mutations per sample, while the national average is 8.4 and the global average is 7.3, the study, as reported by news agency PTI, revealed.To understand the spread and evolutionary history of the virus, the team constructed a global phylogenetic tree, or a tree of relatedness, of viral isolates using the sequence data. In this analysis, it has been found that the Bengaluru isolates are most closely related to the one from Bangladesh.Mutations of a virus are not surprising as it denotes just a change in a nucleic acid base or amino acid molecule. Mutations are not variants; they accumulate and eventually generate variants. A study by Hyderabad's CSIR-Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology has said around 7,684 mutations of SARS-CoV-2 are there in India. The research team has also detected 13 different proteins most of them previously unidentified from clinical samples. "One such protein called Orf9b, which suppresses the hosts' immune response, had been predicted, but the IISc team provided the first evidence of its expression", a statement issued by the research team said.The study has been published in the Journal of Proteome Research.The study was primarily aimed at understanding how the virus is changing and is not about the recent spike in the number of cases in Bengaluru or across thee country. Mutations of a virus do take place and the Centre has dismissed any links between new mutations recently found in Maharashtra and the resurgence of cases in the state.(With PTI Inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-virus-mutating-faster-in-bengaluru-reveals-iisc-study-101614931909558.html

The development comes ahead of next month’s assembly elections.The accused Suresh has claimed that former principal secretary of the CM M Sivasankar, a senior IAS officer, was the main link between politicians, consulate officials and the smuggling syndicate. She further said that since she knew Arabic she was often called to translate their conversations in every meeting, the customs added.“The respondent (Swapan Suresh) had clearly stated about the improper and illegal activities of the CM, three minister and the Speaker. She has also further stated about the involvement and kickbacks received by high-profile persons from various deals,” said the affidavit submitted by the Customs and Preventive Commissioner Sumit Kumar in the high court.The CPI(M) has planned marches to the customs office in main cities on Saturday against what it called “selective and deliberate attempt of central agencies to portray the state government in a bad light”. “Nobody can browbeat us citing the statement of an accused. I was questioned several times by different agencies and they failed to produce any evidence against me. These wild charges will also meet the same fate,” said state higher education minister KT Jaleel, one of the three ministers reportedly mentioned by Swapna Suresh.The copy of the affidavit was later leaked out to the media. “The role of former principal secretary (M Sivasankar) in acting as the kink between the high-profile politicians of Kerala and UAE consulate officials as well as some others in co-ordinating illegal financial dealings under the cover of various activities and projects of the state government was also revealed by her,” the affidavit claimed.Opposition Congress and the BJP sought the immediate resignation of the chief minister. “He has no right to continue in power for a minute. He has brought shame to the state,” said opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala.“The CM and his ministers’ involvement is clear now. Vijayan can’t cling on to power now,” said BJP president K Surendran.When contacted a government spokesman said he will make a detailed statement in the evening after going through the affidavit. But he said selective leaking of documents was a deliberate attempt to portray the government in bad light during the poll time.Suresh is presently lodged in district women jail in Thiruvananthapuram. She had earlier approached the court to provide personal security to her in jail and family members outside.The sensational gold smuggling case came to light last July after customs seized 30 kg gold from a consignment that came in the name of an official of the UAE consulate in Thiruvananthapuram. Later the case was handed over to the National Investigation Agency (NIA) and at least four other central agencies are part of the probe now. The NIA and other agencies had arrested 30 persons in connection with the case including the CM’s former principal secretary, M Sivasankar, and questioned a minister and many others. The central agencies had filed cases for dollar smuggling and other crimes related to the main offence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pinarayi-vijayan-3-ministers-involved-in-kerala-gold-smuggling-court-told-101614932095057.html

JP Dhanopia, a party spokesman, said he would not comment on Shekhar’s demand. “...Railways follow the norm of writing the names of stations on signboards in Hindi, Urdu, and English and in southern states in their regional languages. It has nothing new. So, people should not create controversy. Urdu is a rich language, and it should not be connected with any religion.”Jitendra Kumar, a railways public relations officer, said the name was written in Urdu by mistake due to some communication gap. “We rectified our mistake by removing the name by yellow colour paint,” said Kumar.The Western Railways has constructed the railway station six km from Ujjain along the route connecting Indore and Ujjain with Fatehabad. It has been named after a famous temple Chintaman Ganesh of the area, said Kumar.Writer and poet Shyam Munshi said the railways should have behaved sensitively. “I am ashamed of it.

It also has 42 species of mammals, 264 bird species, 39 reptile species and 12 amphibian species.On Thursday, forest officials in Odisha claimed that the fires in the reserve were under control. "The fires were reported only in areas on the fringe of the reserve. These are not continuous fires that we see in places like the US or Australia, but sporadic fires that are caused due to anthropogenic factors. There has been no loss of wildlife due to the fire," said regional chief conservator of forests of Baripada circle, M Yogajayananda.His claims were disputed by conservationists working in Similipal, who alleged that the forest department staff was yet to venture into several fire spots in Thakurmunda and Podadiha range. "The officials are claiming that no loss of wildlife has happened. There are several pangolins, forest fowls, peafowls and other wild animals that could have died. How could the department know before all the fires have been put out," asked Vanoomitra Acharya, a local conservationist.The fire in Similipal biosphere reserve came at a time when Odisha topped the list of forest fire incidents with 8,688 fire spots since February 25 as per the Forest Survey of India’s fire alerts system based on SNPP (Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership). Telangana came a distant second with 1769 fires in the same time. Odisha also saw 11,708 forest fires since November 1 last year, the highest among all the states.The state forest department on Thursday, however, noted that although the FSI fire point incidences reported are very high during February-March, they have not been responded / attended to immediately. "It is seen that about 60% of the reported fire points have only been responded. It is imperative that all the fire points in the field are attended on priority basis and the forest fire should be extinguished immediately before it is spread to adjoining forest areas. The range officers have to ensure that all the fire point incidences should be attended within one hour of reporting and the Range Officer should submit a certificate on a daily basis to the DFO that all the fire points reported have been attended within one hour of reporting, failing which, the DFO should intimate the same to the PCCF. All out efforts should be made for prevention of forest fires through effective foot patrolling, surveillance and sensitization of Vana Suraksha Samiti members and forest dwellers," special secretary of state forest department Lingaraj Ota wrote in a letter to all divisional forest officers on Thursday.According to the India State of Forest Report 2019, of the 30,000 incidents of forest fires that were reported in India in 2019, most of them were reported from Odisha, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and the southern states. "The dry deciduous forests, which receive low rainfall, face 5-6 dry months and have nutrient poor soil, such as those in tropical and subtropical latitude, are more vulnerable to fire compared to others," the FSI report said.The report further said that of the total 712,249 square km of forest cover in the country, 152,421 square km (21.40%) was either highly or extremely fire prone. Most of these vulnerable forests were in Odisha, Mizoram, Chhattisgarh, Manipur and Madhya Pradesh. Forest Survey of India has been conducting investigations in different parts of the country since 1965, keeping records of forest fires in sample plots and developing a forest fire alert system.Also Read: Similipal blaze contained, Odisha asks for rapid response to forest firesThe rise in forest fires over Odisha this year is being attributed to rise in daytime temperatures. In Similipal, the daytime temperatures over the last fortnight have hovered around 40 degrees Celsius, which experts say is the major reason for forest fires. Yet, the experts said fire management in India should be focussed on prevention and getting the tribal communities involved in forest management.Raman Sukumar of Centre for Ecological Sciences in Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore said the forest bureaucracy should focus on prevention of fires instead of detection and suppression. "The whole fire management process should be relooked and the prevention system should start by the end of winter. Forest departments should involve tribals and use their traditional knowledge to manage the forests more effectively,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nasa-satellites-show-fires-still-raging-over-similipal-rest-of-odisha-101614927032452.html

05-03-2021||India||Sansad TV: Cost-cutting, content rejig behind merger of RS, LS TV||Indian Parliament this week decided to merge the separate channels dedicated to its two Houses, Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha, and launch Sansad TV under one administration. Sansad TV is expected to be launched in two weeks even as the status quo will be maintained, for now, an official aware of the matter said. The proceedings of the second phase of the Budget Session from March 8 are expected to be telecast on Lok Sabha TV (LSTV) as well as Rajya Sabha TV (RSTV).The merger was approved a year after a former Prasar Bharati chairman A Surya Prakash-led panel formed in 2019 to assess ways to rationalise the two channels submitted its report to the presiding officers of the two Houses. The panel has suggested cost-cutting, streamlining of the management of the two channels and content rejig to make it more attractive for viewers and advertisers.Also Read | Lok Sabha, Rajya Sabha channels merged to create new platform, Sansad TVPeople aware of the matter said the panel has recommended two channels, Sansad 1 and Sansad 2, to broadcast programmes in English, Hindi, and regional languages. There is no clarity on whether both channels will be launched. According to a person familiar with the matter, RSTV was launched initially with a budget of ₹100 crore. “Rajya Sabha TV had 500 posts, while Lok Sabha TV had 134 employees... these may be scaled down to 250,” the person said. “The recruitment process is also likely to start all over again, with current employees also having to be vetted.”The two channels got advertisements primarily from the public sector and the government. The person said the LSTV turned profitable for some time, but RSTV continued incurring losses. LSTV is based in Parliament and RSTV operates from New Delhi’s Talkatora Stadium. “The rent for the [RSTV] space is around ₹30 crore,” the person said. “It was only after Rajya Sabha chairman Venkaiah Naidu intervened that the rent was scaled down a little.”People familiar with the matter said there is also little clarity on how the integration will proceed as the salary structures of the two channels are different. Another issue is who the Sansad TV CEO will report to, the Lok Sabha speaker or vice-chairman of the Rajya Sabha. RSTV was completely independent while the Lok Sabha secretariat controlled the LSTV. This will also have to be addressed, the people added.Congress leader Manish Tewari, who is also a former information and broadcasting minister, said he has not looked at the mechanics of the move. “From what I am given to understand, they want to brand LSTV as a Hindi channel and RSTV as the English Channel. They will continue to perform their parliamentary functions. If there is going to be synergy in sharing of resources, equipment, and have one person looking after it, it is not a bad idea.”Former RSTV editor-in-chief Gurdeep Sappal said the channel was consciously designed differently at variance with LSTV. “We developed it as an effective public broadcaster, not limiting it to just parliamentary proceedings and members of parliament,” Sappal said. He said the channel’s Content Advisory Committee, comprising leaders from major parties in Rajya Sabha, brainstormed the content. “That is the reason that there was a general consensus on the approach and content delivery and its neutrality could be ensured,” said Sappal. “I do not know the philosophy of the new avatar of the channel and whether it has been discussed in the Content Advisory Committee. I sincerely hope that the character and neutrality of the channel will be maintained and all parties in both the Houses will have a say in shaping up the new format.”Somnath Chatterjee, the then speaker of Lok Sabha, came up with the idea of a dedicated channel for parliamentary coverage in 2005 when Doordarshan chose to telecast a cricket match instead of the House proceedings. “Doordarshan...had its commercial reasons for deciding that the cricket match should be aired,” said former Lok Sabha TV editor-in-chief Ashish Joshi.Lok Sabha TV began its 24-hour transmission on July 24, 2006, with the commencement of the eighth session (Monsoon) of the 14th Lok Sabha. Rajya Sabha TV was launched in 2011.The parliamentary proceedings were first televised when Doordarshan aired the President’s address on December 20, 1989. “In 1991, during the Tenth Lok Sabha, telecast/tele-filming of Question Hour began that was followed by the live telecast of Railway Budget and General Budget during 1992. Since April 1994, the entire proceedings of the Lok Sabha were tele-filmed for archival purpose,” according to a government note on Lok Sabha TV.In July 1994, a transmitter was installed in Parliament for the live telecast of Lok Sabha proceedings from the following month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sansad-tv-cost-cutting-content-rejig-behind-merger-of-rs-ls-tv-101614926875374.html
05-03-2021||India||SSR death: NCB files over 12,000-page charge sheet, names Rhea Chakraborty||The Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB), which has been probing a drug-related angle in the death of Bollywood actor Sushant Singh Rajput, filed a lengthy chargesheet on Friday in front of a special NDPS court. The chargesheet names 33 accused, including Rhea Chakraborty, and contains the statement of 200 witnesses. The hard copy contains over 12,000 pages and the digital format is around 50,000 pages.The chargesheet has gone beyond Sushant Singh Rajput's death and traced the trail of narcotics — its sourcing and then distribution — in Mumbai.Going by the first arrest the agency made in September, NCB had six months' time to file the chargesheet. The case was registered in August after the Enforcement Directorate shared private WhatsApp chats allegedly on sourcing drugs between actor Rhea Chakraborty, her brother Showik Chakraborty and some of Sushant Singh Rajput's staff. All of them were accused by the agency of procuring and supplying drugs for the late actor. While Rhea, Showik and Sushant Singh Rajput's staff — Samuel Miranda, Deepesh Sawant — are all out on bail, the agency arrested over 30 people in connection with this and several are in custody at present.In its six-month-long probe, the agency conducted raids in several locations of Maharashtra and claimed to have busted some rackets actively operating in the city and allegedly inside Bollywood.The agency recorded statements of actors Deepika Padukone, Sara Ali Khan, Rakul Preet, Shraddha Kapoor, Arjun Rampal among others.All these statements and other findings by the agency have been submitted to the court which will now be verified and then the accused will be asked to appear in the court.Maharashtra minister Nawab Malik's son-in-law Sameer Khan was also arrested in this case in January. In February, NCB arrested film director Rishikesh Pawar who was a friend of Sushant Singh Rajput. Kshitij Ravi Prasad, who was previously associated with Dharma Production's digital arm, is also one of the accused in this case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ssr-death-ncb-files-12-000-page-charge-sheet-in-drug-angle-case-101614926071783.html

05-03-2021||India||Poonawalla warns of delays as US prioritizes Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine||The head of the world’s biggest vaccine maker and the World Health Organization’s chief scientist said manufacturers of coronavirus shots face a global shortage of the raw materials needed to churn out the inoculations.Adar Poonawalla, the chief executive officer of the Serum Institute of India Ltd. -- which is licensed to produce hundreds of millions of Covid-19 vaccines from AstraZeneca Plc and Novavax Inc. -- told a World Bank panel on Thursday that a U.S. law blocking the export of certain key items, including bags and filters, will likely cause serious bottlenecks. Soumya Swaminathan from the WHO added that there were shortfalls of vials, glass, plastic and stoppers required by those companies.“The Novavax vaccine, which we’re a major manufacturer for, needs these items from the U.S.,” Poonawalla said. “If we’re talking about building capacity all over the world, the sharing of these critical raw materials is going to become a critical limiting factor -- nobody has been able to address this so far.”Those supply disruption concerns have arisen after the Biden administration announced plans to use the Defense Production Act to boost supplies needed to make Pfizer Inc.’s vaccines. Last year, Pfizer scaled back its production targets after the U.S. drugmaker ran into difficulties securing all the materials it needs to produce the vaccines at a large scale, a reminder that the world is depending on mass manufacturing at an unprecedented speed and scale to end the pandemic.“This is one thing that would need some discussion with the Biden administration to explain to them there’s enough to go around,” Poonawalla said. “We’re talking about having free global access to vaccines but if we can’t get the raw materials out of the U.S. -- that’s going to be a serious limiting factor.”Even under ideal conditions, getting injections into the arms of 7.8 billion people would test the delicate choreography of the world’s supply chains in ways unseen in peacetime. That’s because producing a vaccine relies on a complex global value chain of raw materials and components.“There is a shortage of materials, of products that you need for the manufacturing of vaccines,” said Swaminathan. “This is where again you need global agreement and coordination not to do export bans.”She said the WHO’s vaccine partners, the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations and the Developing Countries Vaccine Manufacturers Network, will hold meetings on Monday and Tuesday next week to discuss those issues.Despite Poonawalla’s warnings, he said that Serum had in the past two months distributed 90 million doses of AstraZeneca’s vaccine to 51 countries after it was granted emergency authorization by Indian regulators in early January -- a record pace for the company.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/poonawalla-warns-of-delays-as-us-prioritizes-pfizer-covid-19-vaccine-101614922980119.html
05-03-2021||India||NCB to file chargesheet in drug case related to SSR death today||The Narcotics Control Bureau, which has been probing the drug-related angle in the death of Bollywood actor Sushant Singh Rajput, will file its chargesheet in Special NDPS court on Friday, news agency ANI reported. Sushant Singh Rajput's friend Bollywood actor Rhea Chakraborty, her brother Showik are among the accused in the case. The actor was found dead on June 14 at his residence.The NCB had registered a case in August linked with Sushant Singh Rajput's death after the Enforcement Directorate disclosed alleged chats between Rhea Chakraborty, her brother Showik and Sushant Singh's former manager and staff. Since August, the agency conducted several raids and arrested over 30 people in connection with the case.The first arrest, in this case, was made in September and, counting since then, the agency had six months to file the chargesheet. Rhea, Showik, Sushant Singh Rajput's staff Miranda, Deepesh Sawant were booked for allegedly procuring drugs for the deceased actor. All of them are now out on bail.Several entertainment personalities, including Deepika Padukone, Sara Ali Khan, Rakul Preet, Shraddha Kapoor, Arjun Rampal, were interrogated during the probe and their statements were recorded. However, a Supreme Court ruling of last October made it clear that confessional statements made before an investigating officer of an agency like NCB will not be considered as evidence to convict an accused.The probe created a stir in Bollywood as Maharashrta ministers said this was an attempt to defame Bollywood. Maharashtra minister Nawab Malik's son-in-law Sameer Khan was also arrested in this case in January.In its latest action, in this case, NCB on February 5 arrested film director Rishikesh Pawar who was a friend of Sushant Singh Rajput. Another big arrest was Kshitij Ravi Prasad, who was previously associated with Dharma Production's digital arm.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ncb-to-file-chargesheet-in-drug-case-related-to-ssr-death-today-101614922347563.html
05-03-2021||India||Leaders of Quad countries set to hold first summit this month||The leaders of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue or Quad are set to hold their first summit in a virtual format this month, with the US administration taking the initiative to set up the meeting, people familiar with developments said on Friday.Confirmation about the meeting came from Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, who told a news conference he had discussed the matter with US President Joe Biden, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga in recent conversations.“So, I am looking forward to that first gathering of the Quad leaders. It will be the first ever such gathering,” he said in response to a question from a reporter on whether he had received an invitation for the meeting.Also Read | Indian-Americans ‘taking over’ US, says Biden on call with Nasa’s Swati MohanThe people cited above said on condition of anonymity that the virtual summit is expected to be held on March 12.There was no official word from the Indian side on the development.The US had also taken the lead in organising the third meeting of the foreign ministers of the Quad on February 18, against the backdrop of continuing concerns over China’s actions across the region. That meeting had reiterated the group’s commitment to a rules-based world order underpinned by respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty.Morrison told the news conference that the Quad Summit was one of the first things he and Biden had discussed when they spoke on phone on February 3. The Quad, he added, was central to ongoing arrangements between Australia and the US.“The Quad is very central to the US and our thinking about the region and looking at the Indo-Pacific also through the prism of our Asean partners and their vision of the Indo-Pacific,” he said.Biden and US secretary of state Antony Blinken had made clear that their re-engagement in multilateral organisations is “key to building stability and peace in the Indo-Pacific”, Morrison said. “We share that view, we encourage that view, and we strongly welcome that view,” he added.Morrison said the four Quad leaders are looking forward to the first virtual summit and follow-up face-to-face meetings.“This will become a feature of Indo-Pacific engagement but it’s not going to be a big bureaucracy with a big secretariat and those sort of things. It will be four leaders, four countries working together constructively for the peace, prosperity and stability of the Indo-Pacific, which is good for everyone in the Indo-Pacific,” he said.“It’s particularly good for our Asean friends [and] those throughout the southwest Pacific to ensure that they can continue with their own sovereignty and their own certainty for their own futures,” he added.The move to hold the first Quad Summit fits in with the Biden administration’s position that China is its biggest security challenge and competitor on the global stage.While the former Trump administration had talked of formalising and expanding the Quad, questions have been raised on whether the Biden administration will adopt a more cautious approach to the group as a counter-balance to China.Chinese officials have likened the Quad to a “mini NATO” and said its activities are aimed at targeting third parties, a charge rejected by the four members of the group.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/leaders-of-quad-countries-set-to-hold-first-summit-this-month-101614921714664.html

The decision was taken by the Ministry of Railways "in the interest of the safety of passengers''. Amid the ongoing coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic, the fair hike aims to achieve its target of reducing the number of people at stations. The decision would help ensure social distancing and Covid-appropriate behaviour.2. A notification in this regard was issued by the ministry, in which it said that regulation and controlling of the crowd at stations is the responsibility of the Divisional Railway Managers (DRMs).3. "Deterring more persons to visit the station, the platform ticket charges are increased from time to time after assessing the ground situation. The power to change charges of platform tickets has been delegated to DRMs due to field management requirements," the notification read.4. The ministry said that there was nothing new about the measure as it is in practice for many years and is used occasionally as a short-term crowd control measure. In February too, the ministry had hiked the ticket fares of short-distance passenger trains to discourage people from unnecessary travel.5. The platform ticket price has been increased from Rs10 to Rs30.(with ANI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hike-in-platform-ticket-rates-to-prevent-overcrowding-at-stations-railways-101614920984934.html

05-03-2021||India||MP exam’s 10 toppers from same college, made same mistakes; CM orders probe||Madhya chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan on Thursday ordered an inquiry into an alleged irregularity in the recruitment examination of farmers’ welfare and agriculture department.The top ten candidates, who appeared in the exam conducted for appointing agriculture officers by the Madhya Pradesh Professional Examination Board (MPPEB) (popularly known as Vyapam) on February 10 and 11, committed the same mistakes and scored similar marks in different sections of the question paper, apart from several other suspicions raising coincidences, as seen in the answer sheet provided by MPPEB.Other candidates, who appeared in the exam, raised an alarm after they found that all these ten candidates belonged to the Chambal division, had the same caste, graduated from the same college and had similar academic records.According to an official, the chief minister asked the chairman of MPPEB and principal secretary of the agriculture department to probe the matter and submit a report in this regard.The examination was held for 823 posts in the agriculture department and the answer sheets were released on February 17 with the list of probable selected candidates. It was then that suspicion was raised over the authenticity of the exam in the backdrop of the infamous rigging of the entrance examination to medical colleges in 2013-14, popularly known as the Vyapam scam.Not only were the toppers from one region and caste, but they also had poor academic background but ended up scoring the highest marks in the recruitment exam, which doesn’t have any provision of an interview to qualify.A candidate Radhe Jat from Bhopal said, “The top ten scorers completed their Bachelor of Science (Agriculture) degrees from a government agriculture college in Gwalior. Almost all the candidates completed their four-year degrees in five or more years.”“The suspicion increased when the MPPEB released the answer sheets on February 17 with wrong answers to three questions. The top scorers also wrote the same wrong answers in their answer sheets. We don’t know whether it is a coincidence or a conspiracy, but how is it possible that they all gave wrong answers, especially to basic questions studied in class 11,” said another candidate Sachit Anand from Satna.Also Read: Indore ranks ninth in Centre's Ease of Living Index 2020, gets CM's praisesOne of the top scorers, who scored full marks in the maths section, had failed in the statistics exam at least four times and completed his degree in eight years, he added.The candidates also raised questions on the company which was outsourced by MPPEB to conduct the exam.“MPPEB allowed a blacklisted company NSEIT to conduct the exam. NSEIT is the same company that was blacklisted by UP after a question paper of sub-inspector recruitment examination got leaked in 2017. The incidents of leak of question papers were also reported in other exams including the teacher recruitment test in Tamil Nadu and protection officer test of Railways,” said Rajesh Singh from Gwalior, a candidate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shivraj-singh-chouhan-orders-inquiry-in-agriculture-department-recruitment-exam-101614919441415.html
05-03-2021||India||Reserves exhausted early, Chhattisgarh coal mine seeks larger forest area||A coal block in Chhattisgarh’s Hasdeo Arand region has nearly exhausted its reserves seven years before the approved timeline, and has applied for an amendment to the forest clearance granted to it by the Union environment ministry.The forest clearance for phase 1 of Parsa East and Kete Basan (PEKB) coal block was granted in March 2012 for 15 years over a forest area of 762 hectares considering an annual capacity of 10 million tonnes per annum (MTPA). But in less than nine years, the mine has nearly exhausted its reserves according to documents uploaded on the environment ministry’s Parivesh website.The production capacity of the mine was enhanced from 10 MTPA to 15 MTPA as per directions of the Ministry of Coal and as per a revised environmental clearance dated August 10 2018, states a letter from M/ s Rajasthan Rajya Vidyut Utpadan Nigam Limited (RVUNL), which owns the mine, to the environment ministry requesting an amendment to the forest clearance.Also Read | Scientists warn of rebound after record 7% fall in global emissionsThe letter dated September 9, 2020, seen by HT, says the mine is presently producing coal at the rate of 15 MTPA. “Considering the annual mine production of 15 MTPA from 2018-19 onwards, reserves within the phase 1 boundary would now exhaust by mid of 2021-22,” it said. The environment ministry, in a letter dated December 4, 2020, has sought the Chhattisgarh government’s opinion on whether an additional forest land of 269.845 hectares can be allotted to RRVUNL to mine during phase 1 of their project.The move is facing widespread opposition by environmentalists because PEKB is located in Hasdeo Arand region, one of the largest contiguous stretches of very dense forests in central India spanning 170,000 hectares which has 22 coal blocks underneath. PEKB was a “no-go” area for mining as per a draft report of the environment ministry and the forest advisory committee forest diversion for the project in 2011. However, the project was reconsidered after then environment minister Jairam Ramesh observed that the coal blocks are clearly in the “fringe” and actually not in the biodiversity rich Hasedo Arand forest region and are separated by a well-defined high hilly ridge.A revised proposal was considered envisaging sequential mining in two phases, each phase lasting 15 years, the first covering 762 hectares and the second 1,136 hectares, with reclamation of the mined out area to commence from the third year onwards.“There is a reason why mining activity is proposed in a phased manner. There are direct consequences of various mining operations, including excavation, blasting and the movement of mined ore. The environment clearance for the project is based on an impact assessment that justifies the phased nature of these impacts, many of which are still pending detailed scrutiny,” said Kanchi Kohli, legal researcher at the Centre for Policy Research.“Unfortunately, the environment ministry defied its own precautions while allowing the additional extraction capacity in 2018. This created a fait accompli situation allowing the company to be able to advance its timeline for phase 2 of mining activity, which will now require additional land and will impact existing forest rights,” she added.The forest clearance granted to PEKB in March 2012 had specified that during phase 2, mining permission for the remaining 1,136 hectares will be linked to the reforestation and biodiversity management in phase 1. The project proponent will submit the application for permission for mining in phase 2 along with a compliance report of phase 1.“We had written to the environment ministry’s forest advisory committee and the expert appraisal committees that increasing the production capacity of the mine would naturally lead to a change in forest clearance conditions. The mining plan was changed even without considering the forest clearance conditions making it a fait accompli situation. They have exhausted the mine in the period of only eight years and are now expanding to a larger forest area seven years before its scheduled time. This has become a mockery of the NGT judgement of 2014 which had ordered a detailed biodiversity, wildlife and carrying capacity study for the area which have not yet been done,” said Sudiep Shrivastava, an advocate who had petitioned NGT against environment ministry’s decision to grant forest clearance for the mine.“If the mine is exhausted, for further expansion the project proponent has to approach us. I have to check what the state government’s opinion is on this matter,” said a senior official from the forest conservation division of MoEFCC.The mine is owned by Rajasthan Rajya Vidyut Utpadan Nigam Limited (RRVUNL) while coal mine developer-cum-operator (MDO) operations have been awarded to Adani Enterprises. Adani Enterprises did not respond to HT’s queries on the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/reserves-exhausted-early-chhattisgarh-coal-mine-seeks-larger-forest-area-101614919495021.html

The issue of the argument is not known yet.One of them fled the spot to save his life and crossed into the Indian border, the other one is missing. "We have received information that three Indian nationals who had gone to Nepal had a confrontation with Nepal Police on some issue. One man has been shot and succumbed to injuries at a hospital. Another one crossed the border and entered the India side to save his life, while the third one is still missing," news agency ANI quoted Pilibhit Superintendent of Police Jai Prakash as saying.Following the incident, tension has increased in the area while police are monitoring the situation.

05-03-2021||India||Give allowance till son gets his first degree, not just till he's 18: SC||The Supreme Court on Thursday directed a man to support his son financially not only till he turned 18 but till the time he completed his first degree course while observing that graduation was now considered “basic education”.The bench comprising justices Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud and MR Shah ordered the man to pay for his son’s education till March 31, 2027, to ensure he has the necessary financial support to complete his graduation.“Paying only till he turns 18 will not be sufficient in present times when the first basic degree comes only after one completes his college. You (the man) should pay for his education, at least till he gets his first formal degree from a college,” the bench told the man while modifying an order of the family court.The family court, in its order dated September 2017, had directed the man to pay ₹20,000 per month towards the maintenance of his son from his first marriage till he turned 18. The couple was married in 1999, the boy was born in March 2004.Also Read | ‘Can’t mandate perverse equality’: SC on plea over commission for womenThe man, an employee in Karnataka government’s health department, separated from his first wife after their divorce in June 2005, following which the family court in Karnataka’s Bagalkot fixed the maintenance for the child at ₹20,000 per month. The man appealed in the high court, which upheld the maintenance order in December 2019.The man moved the apex court, contending his net take home salary was a little over ₹21,000 and since he had married again and had two children, paying ₹20,000 to his son from the first marriage will leave him with virtually nothing to maintain his new family.Advocate Chinmay Deshpande, appearing for the man, further pointed out that the couple had separated because the woman was in an adulterous relationship. But the bench was quick to shoot down this submission: “You cannot punish the child for this. What does the child have to do all this? And when you married again, you must have known you already have a child that you need to support.”Representing the child and his mother, advocate Gaurav Agrawal said that it would be more appropriate if the father were directed to pay a lesser sum every month, but not only till the son turned 18; instead, till he completed his graduation.The bench called this suggestion “fair”, noting such an order would ensure the necessary financial support for the son to enable him complete his first degree course. It, therefore, reduced the monthly maintenance for the child to ₹10,000 every month, starting March 1, 2021, while further directing the father to enhance the monthly allowance by ₹1,000 at the start of every subsequent financial year.The court ordered that this amount shall be paid for a period of six years or until the child completed his degree course. It also held that ₹6.64 lakh, which has already been paid by the father, shall be treated as full and final settlement of allowance till date.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pay-maintenance-till-son-gets-a-degree-not-just-till-he-s-18-supreme-court-101614914873518.html

This is the first time such an incident has been reported since anti-coup protests began in the country.“These men claim they are policemen. We have sent officials to verify their claims. They are yet to submit a report. It is very likely that the information is true,” Lalchamliana said.“This is the first such incident of Myanmar nationals entering Mizoram after last month’s coup. Though there are reports of an impending influx of nationals from the country, through the other districts in Mizoram bordering Myanmar, nothing of that sort has happened yet,” he added.A Reuters report quoting unnamed officials stated that at least 19 Myanmarese policemen have crossed over to the Indian side through border areas in Serchip and Champhai districts. HT can’t independently verify that claim.Authorities in Mizoram have been bracing for a possible influx of refugees from Myanmar since last month’s coup and the growing civil disobedience against it. The state shares a 510 km border with the neighbouring nation.In an order issued on Tuesday, the Champhai administration asked people in the district, especially those residing in border areas, to immediately notify any information about Myanmarese nationals entering India seeking shelter.“If somebody crosses over without the notice of the district administration or village councils in border areas, those persons have to be caught and the local authorities alerted. They have to record entries of people who are not Indian nationals,” Maria CT Zuali, deputy commissioner, Champhai, said over phone.Once village councils submit reports of any such entry of Myanmar nationals in their areas, the district administration would take action against them in consultation with the Centre.“We will try and find out if at all the lives of those entering India are threatened in Myanmar. We can decide on these people based on what the Centre says. If permission is not granted to take them in as refugees, they would be deported,” Zuali said.Also Read: With wish to donate organs, Kyal Sin, 19, dies fighting military rule in MyanmarThe DC stated that till date, no Myanmarese nationals have entered the district following the military coup. But there have been some reports of people seeking refugee status.“We have heard some such reports from a few village councils. We will have a meeting on Thursday on how to treat these illegal migrants. We have to strictly scrutinize each such person and the reason for them trying to enter India. We don’t want any militants trying to sneak in,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mizoram-verifying-reports-of-3-myanmarese-nationals-crossing-over-to-india-101614908180354.html

05-03-2021||India||'Gujarat leg of bullet train may open before Maharashtra first if...': Official||The National High Speed Rail Corporation Limited (NHSRCL) on Thursday said the Gujarat leg of the Ahmedabad-Mumbai bullet train may open first if it could not acquire land in Maharashtra in the next three months.NHSRCL MD Achal Khare also said at a virtual press meet that the deadline of 2023 for completing the project was not feasible, and civil works on Gujarat side were expected to be completed by 2024.The NHSRCL has acquired 95 per cent of the land for the 352-km stretch of the project in Gujarat, but has been able to acquire only 23 per cent of land for the 156-km stretch in Maharashtra."Of the 352-km stretch, we have acquired 95 per cent of land thanks to the cooperation of people as well as the Gujarat government," Khare said, adding that the remaining five per cent will be acquired by mid-June."The NHSRCL has been able to acquire 23 per cent land so far in Maharashtra. If we are able to acquire about 70 per cent to 80 per cent land in the next three months, we can start the entire project together," he said.If not, the NHSRCL will have to consider opening the Gujarat leg of the bullet train in the first phase and the Maharashtra leg in the second phase, he said."There are many issues over land acquisition in Maharashtra. We are in talks with our Japanese counterparts to open the Gujarat phase of the project first," Khare said.The Uddhav Thackeray-led MVA government in Maharashtra had said after coming to power that it will review the necessity of the project.For the Gujarat leg of the project, contracts worth ₹32,500 crore have been awarded for the construction of 325 km stretch and five stations, Khare said.The bullet train will have eight stations in Gujarat and four in Maharashtra."Tenders for Sabarmati and Ahmedabad stations and 18 km stretch in that city will be released on March 25, while those for Vadodara station and 7 to 8 km stretch in that city will be released in June," Khare said.The original deadline of completing the project in 2023 is not feasible as a year was lost due to the COVID-19 pandemic and land acquisition issues in Maharashtra, he said."We expect to complete the civil works on the Gujarat side in four years, by 2024," he said.The NHSRCL will need 24 sets of rolling stock for high-speed trains, of which 18 will be imported from Japan, while six will be manufactured in India."Japan has agreed to allow manufacture of six sets of rolling stocks in India. The manufacturer in Japan will tie up with an Indian company and make them here under the `Make in India' initiative. Talks are underway," Khare said.The NHSRCL MD also informed that alignment at Vadodara station has been changed due to various constraints. The new alignment will save roughly ₹2,000 crore, he said.The foundation of the project was laid by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his then Japanese counterpart Shinzo Abe in September 2017. It is expected to cut the travel time between Ahmedabad and Mumbai from the current six hours to less than three hours.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gujarat-leg-of-bullet-train-may-open-first-if-official-101614908147058.html

05-03-2021||India||Delhi HC directs UP police to give post mortem report of farmer, who died during tractor rally||The Delhi High Court on Thursday issued direction to the Uttar Pradesh police to give an original post mortem report of the 25-year-old farmer, who died during the tractor rally on January 26 in the national capital.A Single-Judge Bench of Justice Yogesh Khanna asked Uttar Pradesh police to provide both the original documents to the Delhi Police on March 5 and said that the document shall be retained in safe custody.The Court listed the matter for further hearing on March 17.The Court was hearing a plea-seeking court-monitored probe into the death of a farmer Navreet Singh, who died during the tractor rally on January 26 in the national capital. The family had approached Delhi High Court and raised several questions on the death and sought a post mortem video and X-ray report of the deceased.The plea alleged that the cause of death was by bullet injury but, according to the Delhi Police, Navreet Singh died in the accident after the tractor he was driving overturned after ramming into a barricade near ITO in Delhi.Lawyer for petitioner Advocate Vrinda Grover submitted that various medical/forensic experts who have reviewed the description of injuries in the post mortem report have independently made statements reported by various media houses, opining that the injuries are consistent with firearm/gunshot wounds and that the said injuries could not have resulted from the tractor overturning, as has been repeatedly asserted and announced by the Delhi police including senior officers, the Commissioner of Police and Deputy Commissioner of Police.The plea moved by the grandfather of the deceased has stated that he has sufficient reason to mistrust and not accept the hasty, unverified and self-serving conclusion of the Delhi Police, which has publicly and without any investigation stated that the death of his grandson was a motor vehicle accident.According to the Delhi Police, Navreet Singh died in the accident after the tractor he was driving overturned after ramming into a barricade near ITO.Delhi Police and UP Police told the Delhi High Court that the cause of death of Navreet Singh, a farmer who died on January 26, is shock and haemorrhage as a result of ante-mortem head injury and not due to any gunshot injury.Delhi Police had released CCTV footage showing the farmer's tractor overturning after ramming into barricades at ITO.Protesters broke barricades to enter New Delhi and clashed with police in several parts of the national capital during the January 26 'tractor rally' protest organised by farmers.The protestors also had entered the iconic Mughal era monument Red Fort and unfurled their flags from its ramparts.Farmers have been protesting on the different borders of the national capital since November 26 last year against the three newly enacted farm laws: Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; the Farmers Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and farm Services Act 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-hc-directs-up-police-to-give-post-mortem-report-of-farmer-who-died-during-tractor-rally-101614903306041.html

We have sent officials to verify their claims. They are yet to submit a report. It is very likely that the information is true,” Lalchamliana said.A Reuters report quoting unnamed officials said at least 19 policemen had crossed over to the Indian side through border areas in Serchip and Champhai districts. HT couldn’t independently verify the claim.Those entering India can be granted refugee status, but they will be deported if the government decides against itAuthorities in Mizoram have been bracing for a possible influx of refugees from Myanmar since last month’s coup and the growing civil disobedience movement against the military.

05-03-2021||India||Cyber policy to factor in threat from state actors||Cyber operations by state actors and the abuse of social media for “narrative warfare” are some of the particular threats likely to be recognised by the government in the National Cyber Security Strategy, 2021 (NCSS 2021), a policy paper that could also make it mandatory for any business or government department with a significant IT interface to set up a cyber safety cell.These will be part of a long-awaited overhaul in how India sees and approaches dangers in the digital domain. India’s current posture stems from the National Cyber Security Policy of 2013, which officials and experts say has become outdated in the face of a threat landscape that affects national security, governance and critical infrastructure, communications, and business more deeply than ever.“It is an all-encompassing document,” said a key official who worked on the paper, asking not to be named. “It addresses all our shortcomings, how to look at infrastructure development and updates the last policy which was relevant at that point of time.’’The 50-odd pages document, anchored by the national security adviser’s office, is now awaiting the approval from the Prime Minister’s office before it is released. Hindustan Times has spoken to several key officials who worked on the paper and shared contours of what the strategy will include.Over the last couple of years, India has faced several high-profile cyber attacks, including those purportedly originating in North Korea that targeted the Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant and the Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) in 2019. Earlier this week, security consultants reported finding a China-backed operation to target India’s electricity grid.HT reported last month several instances in which government domain email addresses were used to launch cyber attacks and the discovery of critical vulnerabilities in several government servers, which could have given attackers access deep into sensitive networks and underscores the need for the country’s digital infrastructure to be made more secure.The government has not commented on the role of any nation-state in any of the incidents cited above.NCSS 2021 is likely to continue with the stance on not attributing threats from a particular country. “We have not named any country,” said an official quoted above. “However, we do recognise that there are both state and non-state actors that are looking to target us in the cybersphere and along with them you have state-backed actors, hacktivists and cyber mercenaries.”The threat landscape, this official added, “has really exploded” with attacks that have now “grown in scope and state sophistication”. “They have all come into play and they are targeting our infrastructure.”The paper has been prepared after consultations hosted by the Cyber Security Coordinator’s office. While it does not go into solutions, it outlines the government’s threat perception in the domain. India’s approach is expected to be along the lines of the strategy documents released by countries such as the US and the UK.The UK, for instance, recognises state-sponsored threats as “a small number of hostile foreign threat actors [that] have developed and deployed offensive cyber capabilities, including destructive ones”. The UK’s strategy document adds: “These capabilities threaten the security of the UK’s critical national infrastructure and industrial control systems. Some states may use these capabilities in contravention of international law in the belief that they can do so with relative impunity.”NCSS 2021 will also recognise the threat of “narrative wars” on social media services, the official quoted above said. Fake news, manipulation, fraud, misinformation and disinformation will be identified as major threats. “A great number of our population use social media so we need to be aware of the different kinds of threats that lurk there,” said the official.One of the other key aspects of the policy will be a proposal to create cells for cyber security in all institutions, public and private, which will involve dedicated budgeting of funds for such resources. “If you use information technology, then you will have to create a cell with experts in your office that will not just protect you but also protect everyone you are dealing with,” said the official. This will need a new regulatory framework, and the authors see it as a possible area of opportunity for employment and skill development.“As a business is connected in the interconnected world, the cyber attacker may attack you and then spread their attack from there to other places. They will have to invest in IT infrastructure and security,” the official added.Experts said India needs to focus on several aspects relating to cybersecurity. “Networks need more robust cyber physical infrastructures and for that more allocation has to happen for critical information infrastructures,” said Subimal Bhattacharjee, an independent adviser on cyber security policy issues.“Likewise, incident reporting and response ecosystem needs more focused attention and so budgets for CERT-IN (the Indian Computer Emergency Response Team) and NCIIPC (National Critical Information Infrastructure Protection Centre) has to be increased so that they add more resources and capabilities.”A second expert said the focus on information security in the context of social media was surprising. “The narrative warfare finding mention in the policy is surprising. I am not sure of the efficacy of mixing this with cybersecurity as it makes implementation problematic,” said Gunjan Chawla, who works with technology and national security at the National Law University, Delhi.“We hope that with this policy being developed, a lot of our security concerns will be addressed,” said a second official working on the policy, asking not to be named.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cyber-policy-to-factor-in-threat-from-state-actors-101614897658901.html
05-03-2021||India||Covid-19: Phase 2 of vaccination drive stuck in first gear||Rajasthan is the runaway leader in the first three days of the second phase of India’s Covid-19 vaccination drive, having given doses to 5,187 per million residents, although an HT analysis of data from the first three days of the expanded drive indicates a slow start across the country.Till Wednesday night, India vaccinated a total of 949,147 people, or 712 per million in Phase 2, which covers the most vulnerable sections of the general public. The government hopes that drafting more private hospitals to administer vaccines and keeping facilities open 24x7 will help increase the numbers. The government has previously said its ultimate target in this phase is 5 million shots a day.Delhi, which gave shots to 1,679 people per million population in the second phase till Wednesday night, was in the second spot, while Odisha (1,283 doses per million) was third.To be sure, the per-million metric provides an easy comparison, although a more accurate denominator is the number of people over the age of 60 and over 45 with co-morbidities – a number that wasn’t immediately available for all states and Union territories. In all, the second phase of the drive is expected to cover 270 million people.HT collated and analysed data for India’s 20 most populated states. In the national capital, 33,259 people lined up to receive jabs in first three days of Phase 2 – an average of a little over 11,000 shots a day. In contrast, the three days before the start of the second phase, when only health care workers and front-line workers were getting jabs, the city averaged 19,176 shots a day. On average, 316,382 people have received shots every day across the country under Phase 2 — this has less than halved (653,565 doses administered per day) from the three days before the opening up of the drive.In Bihar, the fewest people showed up to get shots in the first three days of Phase 2 — only 43 doses were administered per million residents in the state. Uttar Pradesh, with 60 shots per million, and Jharkhand (144 shots per million) accompanied it as the three worst-performing states. Bihar and Uttar Pradesh’s numbers were also skewed by their huge populations and the significant proportion of their population under the age of 18 (they are both among India’s youngest states).The numbers account for those vaccinated in the Phase 2 of the vaccination drive, which includes persons above 60 years of age and those who are 45 years or more and suffering from certain medical conditions. Overall, 949,147 people received shots in this category across India till Wednesday evening. On the other hand, 13 times as many (13.5 million people, or 10,118 per million population) people have received at least one shot under the first phase of the drive, which started on January 16.Experts say there is a need to speed up the drive at least six to 10 times if the country plans to achieve its target of immunising 300 million people most at risk of exposure or death by August.“So far we have immunised only 1% of our population, while Israel has immunised 85% and the US 23%. At the current pace, we will not be able to achieve the target even by the end of the year. We have to speed up the vaccination drive at least six to 10 times,” said Dr SK Sarin, director of the Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences, who headed the Delhi government’s first committee on managing Covid-19 infections.The first phase of the drive, which is still on, included health care and front-line workers. Of these, 6.8 million health care workers were administered at least one dose of the vaccine, while 2.8 million received both doses till Wednesday. Overall, a total of 16.3 million doses of vaccines have been administered across the country as of Wednesday – the 47th day of India’s vaccination campaign.The Union government, which was releasing daily vaccination bulletins that listed the break-up of state-wise figures for the first phase of the inoculation drive, has not done so in the first three days of Phase 2. In the absence of official data at the national level, HT’s vaccination data was collated numbers from respective state governments.With the threat of mutant variants of Sars-CoV-2 and some parts of the country witnessing an uptick in cases, director of Centre of Cellular and Molecular Biology Dr Rakesh Mishra agreed that the drive needs to pick pace. “The vaccination drive needs to be sped up to reach as many as possible as more and more vaccines become available,” he said.“I think, if we need to achieve our target we need to have vaccination in more places, we have to open it up in a manner that those who are willing to take the vaccine are allowed to come rather than calling people and them not turning up,” said Dr Randeep Guleria, director, All India Institute of Medical Sciences. He said that people in the high risk group residing in regions seeing a spurt in infections should be immunised quickly “as it will help in decreasing the mortality and hospitalisations.”An editorial in HT recently called for more vaccines to be approved, that their sales in the open market be allowed, and that the drive be opened to anyone wanting to be vaccinated.Dr Sarin said it’s also important to make sure everyone living in regions such as Maharashtra seeing a surge in cases should be immunised on priority basis.There were teething troubles reported on the first day of the drive’s Phase 2. These issues appeared to be largely sorted by the second and third day, with very few problems reported.“In the beginning there could have been issues as we are trying to vaccinate one-sixth of humanity, but it will all get streamlined as days progress. In fact, most issues faced on day one have already been sorted,” said RS Sharma, chairman empowered group on Covid vaccinations.What is left is effective messaging to be able to overcome vaccine hesitancy among masses, say experts.“In urban centres the turnout of individuals needing vaccination is usually not a problem; it is the semi-urban and rural areas that require more focus,” said Dr MC Misra, former AIIMS director.Dr K Srinath Reddy, founder, Public Health Foundation of India, added: “As more people get vaccinated, it builds confidence among those sitting on the fence. In a month or so it will be clear whether India will meet the target or not.”The Centre is looking at expanding coverage in coming weeks. “We currently have the capacity to vaccinate at least double of what we are doing now per day, and in coming weeks we will be scaling up. We are aiming at vaccinating 5 million individuals on a daily basis,” said Dr NK Arora, member, National Task Force on Covid-related matters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/phase-2-of-vaccination-drive-stuck-in-first-gear-101614897301702.html
05-03-2021||India||OTT regulations a necessity as some even show porn, says SC||The Supreme Court on Thursday said regulations of over the top (OTT) service providers such as Netflix and Amazon Prime Video have become a necessity since some of them even show pornography in the absence of a proper oversight, comments that come shortly after the government put in place a three-tier regulatory mechanism for such companies, and also mandated certification of their content.The court, hearing a pre-arrest bail plea by Amazon Prime’s content chief Aparna Purohit used the words “screening” and “regulation” with reference to the content.The top court expressed its concerns over lack of “screening” before shows and movies were aired on OTT platforms while hearing Purohit’s plea in connection with the ongoing investigation in Uttar Pradesh against the web series Tandav.“Traditional film viewing has now become obsolete. People watching movies and shows on the internet has become very common. Our query is whether these views should be screened,”asked the SC bench of justices Ashok Bhushan and R Subhash Reddy while taking up Purohit’s anticipatory bail plea.The Uttar Pradesh Police filed an FIR against the top Amazon Prime executive (and others associated with the show) for alleged derogatory depiction of Hindu deities and promoting religious enmity through the series. The scenes that caused offence have since been deleted, and the makers as well as the OTT company have apologised.Representing Purohit in the apex court, senior counsel Mukul Rohatgi and Sidharth Luthra, said that rules have recently been notified by the central government, prescribing a structure to be set up for regulation of OTT platforms. They added that most of the OTT platforms, including Amazon Prime Video, were paid platforms and it could safely be presumed that adults, who paid for their subscriptions, were the ones able to watch shows and movies.“The facts of this case are shocking. Look at the FIR, please. She is an employee of Amazon but the company has not been made an accused. Actors, producer, scriptwriter are the accused along with her but the company has not been made an accused anywhere. There are cases filed across the country by some publicity seekers,” complained Rohatgi.Luthra emphasised that Amazon Prime Video had not only removed the contentious scenes but has issued formal apologies, the most recent one on Tuesday in which it said the video streaming platform “again deeply regrets that viewers considered certain scenes to be objectionable in the recently launched fictional series Tandav.”But the bench was emphatic that before it examined Purohit’s bail plea, it would want to take a look at the regulations, which were notified by the central government on February 25.The court then asked solicitor general Tushar Mehta, appearing for the UP government, to submit the regulations before it on Friday when the hearing resumes. “...We are of the view that some screening should take place. In fact, some platforms even show pornography. There has to be some regulations,” commented the bench.Mehta submitted that some of the web series used “filthy language and lots of abuses” while Rohatgi tried to argue that these regulations would not be relevant for deciding Purohit’s bail plea since the FIR against her was filed in January, before the new rules had come into force.The bench, however, said it would examine the rules before taking a call on the bail plea.Purohit moved the top court after the Allahabad high court on February 25 declined to give her protection from arrest while noting that “such people make the revered figures of the religion of majority community source of earning money in a most brazen manner taking benefit of the liberal and tolerant tradition of the country.”Earlier, on January 27, the top court refused to quash the seven first information reports (FIRs) registered against the actors, makers and Purohit for allegedly offending religious feelings, while declining their plea for interim protection from arrest.It rejected the pleas by Bollywood actor Zeeshan Ayyub, Purohit, Tandav director Ali Abbas Zafar, its producer Himanshu Kishan Mehra and writer Gaurav Solanki, directing them to go to five different high courts where the FIRs and criminal complaints were pending.FIRs and criminal complaints were registered in Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka, Bihar, Maharashtra, Delhi and ChandigarhOn February 25, the Centre notified rules that will govern online content.The rules envisage a three-tier regulatory framework, which will apply to social media, digital media, and OTT companies: self-regulation; a body like the Press Council of India headed by a retired judge of the Supreme Court; and, at the apex, an oversight body of the government, with an inter-ministerial committee to ensure adherence to the norms. Besides, OTT platforms will also have to self-classify the content into five age-based categories: U (Universal), U/A 7 years, U/A 13 years, U/A 16 years, and A (Adult), in addition to providing a mechanism of parental lock in their services.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ott-regulations-a-necessity-as-some-even-show-porn-says-sc-101614892661756.html
05-03-2021||India||‘Can’t mandate perverse equality’: SC on plea over commission for women||The Supreme Court on Thursday questioned the Army for denying permanent commission to women short service commission (SSC) officers by requiring them to have the same medical standards at the age of 45 years as their male counterparts, who became entitled at a younger age.Calling for a “change in mindsets”, the top court had last year directed that women officers of the Indian Army, serving under SSC, be considered for grant of Permanent Commission, irrespective of tenure of service, and also for command posts in non-combat areas since “an absolute bar on women seeking criteria or command appointments would not comport with the guarantee of equality under Article 14”.Referring to a petition filed by nearly 60 women officers, a bench of Justices DY Chandrachud and MR Shah said: “You cannot mandate perverse equality by asking women officers at the age of 45 years to fulfil conditions that applied to male officers at the age of 25 years.”The medical fitness team of the Army tested close to 615 women SSC officers entitled for permanent commission, following the apex court judgment, on five counts: psychiatry, height, appendage (bone structure), physical and eye and ear.Senior advocate Meenakshi Arora, who appeared for the petitioners, said some women were eliminated on the basis of their poor annual confidential reports (ACR). For permanent commission, this report is assessed between the 5th to 10th year of service.The petitioners also told the court that the Section Board of the Army appeared to have turned into a “Rejection Board” as only 277 out of 615 women Army officers made it to the final list. “For service performance, you (Army) say we will look at your performance between 5th to 10th year but for medical criteria, you will require to be as medically fit as a male officer when he was appointed,” the bench said.Additional Solicitor General (ASG) Sanjay Jain said he will reply to these arguments on Tuesday when the matter will be next heard.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cant-mandate-perverse-equality-sc-on-plea-over-commission-for-women-101614891847571.html
05-03-2021||India||N-E cities have the strongest feel-good factor||One of the most intriguing data points in the 2020 Ease of Living (EOL) Index is the gap between perceived and actual ease of living in India’s cities.The EOL report has calculated its overall scores on the basis of four parameters: quality of life, economic ability, sustainability and citizen perception. The last parameter, which has a weight of 30% in the overall rankings, was based on a Citizen Perception Survey (CPS), which asked citizens to “evaluate the role of administration through performance in public service delivery, providing insights directly from the citizens”.CPS plays a huge role in boosting overall EOL scores. The all-India EOL index is 53.51, but it drops to 30.69 once the CPS scores are deducted.Is there a pattern to CPS scores being high or low in the country? An HT analysis of the statistics given in the report shows those cities in North-Eastern India -- except Guwahati, they all have a population of less than a million -- have the biggest positive bias, with CPS scores being higher than actual performance indicators.Cities in southern and western India, which perform the best on the more tangible indicators, have the lowest positive bias in their overall scores on account of CPS. The CPS bias is also higher in smaller cities than larger ones.The EOL report has given both overall and CPS excluded scores for all the 111 cities which are part of the survey. A good way to measure the positive bias in overall ranking due to CPS scores is to look at the percentage difference between overall and CPS excluded EOL scores for a city. The higher this number, the bigger will be the positive bias brought about the CPS numbers.A region-wise analysis shows that this number is highest for cities in the North-East (47.3%) and the lowest for cities in the West (40.8%). The positive bias is also stronger when it comes to cities with less than a million people (43.79%), when compared to those with a population of more than a million (41.52%).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ne-cities-have-the-strongest-feel-good-factor-101614890463734.html
05-03-2021||India||Ease of Living Index: Economic might led Bengaluru to top rank||The economic might of India’s flourishing technology capital propelled Namma Bengaluru to the top spot in the centre’s Ease of Living (EoL) report 2020 with 66.70 points. The ranking was based on its performance across 14 categories (and 49 indicators). Pune came in second, according to the report released on Thursday.Bengaluru, India’s technology capital, is an economic powerhouse on account of the presence of some of the world’s largest corporations. It is the country’s largest software exporter and also home to some of the biggest public and private sector companies that have helped create a thriving ecosystem, providing employment and growth.The EoL index evaluates the performance of its cities across four pillars—the quality of life, economic ability, sustainability and citizen perception.“With a score of 78.82, Bengaluru’s performance (economic ability) surpasses the rest (of the other urban centres) by a long distance and raises the average score for the pillar to 13.17. Bengaluru’s high score can be particularly ascribed to its performance in the category, Level of Economic Development, wherein it has achieved a score of 99.50 and raised the average category score to 18.03,” said the report, released on Thursday by Hardeep Singh Puri, India’s Union Minister for Housing & Urban Affairs, civil aviation and Commerce & Industry (MoS).However, the residents of India’s IT capital have been cautious in validating the rankings as Bengaluru is placed 18th among large cities (and 42nd overall) in the citizens' perception survey (CPS) on what appears to be a reflection on the poor quality of infrastructure, sanitation, little or no waste management, unplanned expansion and an ineffective municipal administration among other issues that plague a city that enjoys a global reputation for its prowess in technology.“Bengaluru has emerged as the most livable city in India in the Ease of Living Survey conducted by @MoHUA_India. The Bengaluru model of development of citizen-centric initiatives and delivery of services have ensured the top ranking of #Bengaluru,” Karnataka chief minister B.S.Yediyurappa posted on Twitter.Bengaluru, classified and categorised among other urban centres with a population higher than a million people (49 of the 111 surveyed), has been ranked 12th in quality of life and 13th in sustainability, according to the report. The municipal administration or BBMP (Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike, the city’s civic body) in this case has been ranked 31st.“There are 100 indicators in the case of municipal performance index. We will go through the ranking and score. Wherever we have scored badly, we will take measures to improve and in the next year our performance will be much better,” said N.Manjunath Prasad, the BBMP commissioner.“To change citizens’ perceptions, we have to engage stakeholders in consultations and constant dialogues. Wherever the citizens feel that we require improvement, it is time to improve it to their satisfaction and we will work in that direction,” he added.India has one of the highest urbanisation rates globally and Indian cities attract millions of white and blue-collar migrant workers from across the country and beyond, seeking better employment opportunities, access to healthcare and education among other requirements including a certain degree of aspirational value.India’s urban population is estimated to become 40% of the country’s population by 2030 and 50% by 2050, according to the report.“The rise in the concentration of urban population vastly outpaces the capacity of local city administration catering to the needs of the people,” the report added.The rise in urban population has led to an increase in the level of economic development but further shrunk economic opportunities that amassed the poorest average score of 8.30 across categories. City resilience, that measures the implementation of disaster reduction strategies, amassed the highest average score of 91.59.The better social and economic indicators of the southern states reflected in the overall rankings with Chennai, Coimbatore, Visakhapatnam, Madurai, Hyderabad and Vijayawada ranked 4, 7, 15, 22, 24 and 44 respectively.Karnataka also has five cities--Davangere, Mangaluru, Tumakuru, Shivamogga and Belagavi--ranked 9, 20, 23, 26 and 47 respectively in the overall||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/economic-might-led-bengaluru-to-top-101614889985968.html

Elections in the state are to be held on April 6.K Surendran, the state BJP president who made the original announcement claimed he was quoted out of context. He said that in the course of the press conference on Thursday he only said Sreedharan was competent enough to be the state’s chief minister. “I was quoted out of context. Such announcements will be made by the parliamentary board of the party.”But party insiders said he was forced to withdraw his comments after the central leadership expressed serious reservations about them.And minister of state for external affairs, V Muraleedharan who earlier lauded the decision in a tweet also backtracked and claimed his tweet was based on media reports. “BJP will fight the poll with E Sreedharan as its chief ministerial candidate. We will defeat both CPI(M) and INC to provide corruption free, development oriented governance for the people of Kerala,” he said.“I cross-checked with party president who said he has not made any such announcement. My initial comment was based on reports appeared in media,” he added.Sreedharan (88), former head of the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC), joined the party formally on Feb 25. He will be fielded from a seat either in Kochi or Thrissur, though he earlier said he preferred his district, Palakkad.Reacting to Surendran’s original comment about being the chief ministerial candidate, Sreedharan said he would take on any work entrusted by the party.Political analysts believe Sreedharan’s entry will give a boost to the BJP in Kerala, where it is a distant third behind the Congress-led UDF and the CPI-M led LDF.“No doubt, his entry will be an image booster for the party but it remains to be seen how this will be translated into votes,” said political analyst Sunnykutty Abraham. The votes will be counted on May 2.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-names-metro-man-as-its-kerala-cm-face-then-retracts-101614888058212.html
05-03-2021||India||Similipal blaze contained, Odisha asks for rapid response to forest fires||Even as the state government claimed that the fire in the Similipal biosphere reserve of Odisha's Mayurbhanj district was under control with 1000 plus men of the forest department on the job, it sounded an alarm for the lack of response by the staff in responding to the rising incidents of fire.“Although the FSI fire point incidences reported are very high during this month they have not been responded / attended to immediately which is a matter of concern. It is seen that about 60% of the reported fire points have only been responded to. It is imperative that all the fire points in the field are attended on priority basis and the forest fire should be extinguished immediately before it spreads to adjoining forest areas. All out efforts should be made for prevention of forest fires through effective foot patrolling, surveillance and sensitization of Vana Suraksha Samiti members and forest dwellers,” the state forest department said in a letter to all divisional forest officers on Thursday.The fire in Similipal biosphere reserve came at a time when Odisha topped the list of forest fire incidents with 8688 fire spots since February 25 as per the Forest Survey of India’s fire alerts system based on SNPP (Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership). Telangana came a distant second with 1769 fires in the same time. Odisha also saw 11,708 forests fires since November 1 last year, the highest among all the states.In Dhenkanal district, few elephants were reported to be trapped inside a forest as a fire broke out in a part of the Hindol forest range on Thursday. As the scared elephants started trumpeting in fear, people in nearby villages rushed out of their homes fearing an attack.Regional chief conservator of forests of Baripada circle, M Yogajayananda said despite 428 incidents of fire in the reserve since February first week, the situation is under control. “The chief wildlife warden had visited the core area of the Similipal tiger reserve and found no casualties of any wild animals. The fires were reported only in areas on the fringe of the reserve. These are not continuous fires that we see in places like US or Australia, but sporadic fires that are caused due to anthropogenic factors. Today we got reports of 26 active fires and we are in the process of controlling the fire” he said.The biosphere reserve spread over an area of 5569 sq km contributes 38% of the total protected area network in Odisha. It is also one of the oldest tiger reserves in the country having the largest zone of Sal trees.However, conservationists working in Similipal that are among the few included by the UNESCO in its list of critical biosphere reserves of the world alleged that several orchids and medicinal plants may have been burnt by the fire.“It would take some time before the losses can be counted. It's too early for anyone to say that there have been no losses,” alleged conservationist Vanoomitra Acharya in Baripada.The forest department meanwhile has asked all DFOs to submit a daily report on the number of fire points in their respective divisions.“The Range officers have to ensure that all the fire point incidences should be attended within one hour of reporting and the Range Officer should submit a certificate on a daily basis to the DFO that all the fire points reported have been attended within one hour of reporting failing which the DFO should intimate the same to the PCCF. 3. The DFOs should ensure that the fire points responded / attended must be uploaded in the OFMS portal on a daily basis,” the department instructed all DFOs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/similipal-blaze-contained-odisha-asks-for-rapid-response-to-forest-fires-101614884539578.html
05-03-2021||India||Top military meet in new avatar, to be ‘multi-layered and informal’||The scope of the Combined Commanders’ Conference, to be addressed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on March 6, has been expanded this year to make it “a multi-layered, interactive and informal event”, with the added participation of 30 officers and soldiers of various ranks from the three services, the department of military affairs (DMA) said in a statement on Thursday.The focus of the conference, being conducted at Kevadia in Gujarat from March 4-6, is on evolving a joint military vision.For the first time, junior commissioned officers (JCOs) and jawans are taking part in the top conference, as reported by Hindustan Times on Wednesday.“The three-day conference will have the combined apex level military leadership of the country reviewing the security situation and defence preparedness of the armed forces, and deliberating pertinent organisational issues for evolving a joint military vision for the future,” the statement said.It will be attended by defence minister Rajnath Singh, chief of defence staff General Bipin Rawat, the three service chiefs, secretary-ranked officers from the defence ministry and top military officials. The PM will chair the valedictory session on Saturday. National security adviser Ajit Doval will also be present.The conference was traditionally held in Delhi. But it has been organised outside the national capital after 2014. In the past, it has been held on India’s solitary aircraft carrier INS Vikramaditya, Indian Military Academy, Dehradun and Air Force Station, Jodhpur.“There have been several major developments in the Higher Defence Organisation since (the last edition of the conference in 2018) including appointment of first ever chief of defence staff and setting up of the DMA, and several important and multifarious issues affecting modernisation and transformation of the armed forces are currently under active consideration/ implementation,” the statement added.The conference is being held at a time when Indian and China are negotiating disengagement in eastern Ladakh and the military is putting finishing touches to its theaterisation plan. It also comes on the back of Indian and Pakistani militaries last week announcing that they had begun observing a ceasefire along the Line of Control from the midnight of February 24.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/top-military-meet-in-new-avatar-to-be-multi-layered-and-informal-101614882098573.html
05-03-2021||India||India’s defence budget for domestic buys to fund fighters, tanks, missiles||The budget set aside for domestic defence procurement in 2021-22 will be used for buying a variety of military hardware, ranging from fighter jets to combat helicopters and tanks to missiles, officials familiar with the modernisation of the armed forces said.India has set aside ₹70,221 crore -- 63% of the military’s capital budget -- for buying locally-produced weapons and systems to boost defence indigenisation.The allocation for indigenous procurement, made for the second consecutive year, will power the purchase of Tejas LCA (light combat aircraft) Mk-1A jets, light combat helicopters (LCHs), basic trainer aircraft, Arjun Mk-1A tanks, Astra beyond-visual-range missiles, Pinaka rocket systems and anti-tank missiles, said one of the officials cited above.Also Read | India signs pact with Philippines for supply of BrahMos missileThe budget will be used for making milestone payments for several domestic acquisitions through the year. Such payments refer to a certain percentage of the total deal amount that has to be paid at different stages of the execution of a contract.Last year, the ministry spent over ₹51,000 crore, or 58% of the capital budget, on domestic purchases.The ₹48,000-crore contract for 83 LCA Mk-1A jets, awarded to Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) last month, is the biggest indigenous defence procurement deal so far.The first Mk-1A aircraft will be delivered to the Indian Air Force in three years, with the rest being supplied by 2030. The deal involves the supply of 73 Mk-1A fighter jets and 10 LCA Mk-1 trainer aircraft.The dedicated financial allocation for indigenous weapons and systems is a game changer and will contribute in a big way to India becoming Atmanirbhar (self-reliant) in defence, said Lieutenant General Vinod Bhatia (retd), a former director general of military operations.“Our dependence on imported military hardware is a major weakness which is being corrected. Dedicated financial allocation will give a much-needed boost to the Make-in-India initiative as also help develop the domestic defence ecosystem. But the procedures and processes too should be addressed as they continue to be laborious,” Bhatia said.Last week, the defence ministry cleared domestic military purchases worth ₹13,700 crore including proposals to buy 118 Arjun Mk-1A tanks and equipping armoured fighting vehicles (AFVs) with modern protection and countermeasure systems.The new tanks will cost ₹8,380 crore, with the order likely to be placed with the Ordnance Factory Board (OFB) this year. Protection systems for the AFVs will cost ₹5,300 crore.Basic trainers and LCHs figure on the government’s negative import list that seeks to ban the import of 101 different types of weapons, systems and ammunition over the next five years. This year, the government is likely to notify a second list of weapons, systems and ammunition that cannot be imported.HAL is likely to be awarded a contract to supply 15 LCHs to the Indian military this month. The IAF and the army together require 160 LCHs.The state-owned plane maker is also likely to be awarded a contract soon for 106 basic trainer aircraft for IAF. Last August, the defence acquisition council accorded its acceptance of necessity (AoN) for 106 Hindustan Turbo Trainer-40 (HTT-40) aircraft for IAF.Also, India will sign a $2.5-billion contract this year for buying 56 medium transport aircraft for IAF to replace its fleet of ageing Avro-748 planes.Airbus Defence and Space and Tata Advanced Systems Limited (TASL) will jointly execute the project to equip the air force with 56 C-295 transport aircraft under the Make-in-India initiative in the aerospace sector.Under the contract, Airbus will deliver the first 16 aircraft in flyaway condition while the remaining 40 will be assembled in India by TASL, as previously reported by Hindustan Times.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indias-defence-budget-for-domestic-buys-to-fund-fighters-tanks-missiles-101614852096078.html
