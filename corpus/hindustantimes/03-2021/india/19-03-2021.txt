The announcement by Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), which backed the development of Sputnik V, means the deal with Stelis is the fourth partnership in India for the production of the inoculation, which has shown a 91.6% efficacy rate in clinical trials. Stelis Biopharma is expected to be able to start supplying the vaccine from the second half of the year. “We are delighted to announce our agreement with Stelis Biopharma for a significant capacity of Sputnik V. The Russian vaccine with efficacy of 91.6% is one of the best vaccines against coronavirus in the world. The significant vaccine volumes, which will be produced jointly with Stelis, will help to widen access to the vaccine on a global scale,” said Kirill Dmitriev, CEO of the Russian Direct Investment Fund. RDIF, which is Russia’s sovereign development fund, added that Stelis -- the biopharma unit of global pharmaceutical company Strides -- will work to provide supplies “beyond the initial agreement”. RDIF head Kirill Dmitriev said that the “significant vaccine volumes” produced with Stelis “will help widen access to the vaccine on a global scale”. RDIF said on Friday that 52 countries have approved the use of Russia’s Sputnik V, named after the Soviet-era satellite. Three other India-based companies are manufactured Sputnik V, which was developed by the Gamaleya Research Institute in Moscow. The companies are Dr Reddy’s laboratories, which is also conducting phase 2/3 bridging studies for the vaccine in India and has applied for emergency use authorisation; Hetero Biopharma, which is likely to manufacture up to 100 million doses annually; and Gland Pharma Ltd, the Indian unit of China’s Fosun Pharma, which is likely to produce nearly 252 million doses. “We are delighted to partner with RDIF to make a substantial contribution towards providing global supply of the Sputnik V vaccine which is one of the most efficacious approved vaccines commercially available. We will also work with RDIF to increase the availability of the vaccine beyond our initial commitments,” said Arun Kumar, founder of Strides group.Sputnik V was initially met with some controversy after being rolled out before the final trial data had been released. But scientists, while releasing the final Phase III data, said its benefit has now been demonstrated.In a comment published alongside the Lancet paper, professors Ian Jones and Polly Roy said: “The development of the Sputnik V vaccine has been criticised for unseemly haste, corner cutting, and an absence of transparency.“But the outcome reported here is clear and the scientific principle of vaccination is demonstrated, which means another vaccine can now join the fight to reduce the incidence of Covid-19”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bluru-firm-to-make-200mn-sputnik-v-doses-101616177607003.html

France is seen as a natural fit for working with Quad as it has 1.5 million citizens on island territories within the Indo-Pacific, and 93% its exclusive economic zone (EEZ) of more than 11 million sq km is also within the region.Work on arranging the India-Australia-Indonesia trilateral has been on for more than six months, but the meeting was held up because of Jakarta’s sensitivities, one of the people cited above said. The French foreign minister is among the speakers at Raisina Dialogue, and the Indonesian foreign minister too is expected to attend the event, a second person said.The trilateral meetings will follow close on the heels of the La Pérouse exercise in the Bay of Bengal from April 4 to 7, which will see the French Navy joining the navies of India, Australia, Japan and the US – the four members of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, or Quad.India will deploy frontline warships and P-8I maritime patrol aircraft for what is being dubbed as a “Quad-plus France” manoeuvre, and the five countries will showcase their naval strength and commitment to freedom of navigation by practising complex drills.At the same time, work has begun on implementing the Quad Vaccine Partnership, which was seen as the most significant outcome of the first virtual Quad Summit on March 12 and envisages the production of one billion doses of Covid-19 vaccines by the end of 2022 for developing countries. The people said Quad members are keen on production of vaccines beginning at Indian facilities as early as the second quarter of 2021. Under the partnership, vaccines developed by US companies will be made in India with funding from the US and Japan, while Australia will provide “last mile” delivery support with focus on South-east Asia.“A lot depends on India’s manufacturing capacity, given the demands on Indian manufacturers to fulfil both the demands of the domestic inoculation programme and commercial supplies and grants for foreign countries,” the first person cited above said.It is believed the four members of Quad are keen on progress on vaccines before the leaders hold their first in-person meeting. Efforts are currently on to schedule this meeting on the margins of the G7 Summit to be hosted by the UK in June. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been invited to the G7 Summit.Australia was chosen for logistics support for vaccine delivery.The other crucial working group formed during the Quad Summit – the critical and emerging technology working group – will focus on collaboration on issues such as 5G, quantum computing, artificial intelligence and cyber-security, the people said.“We’ve seen how such technologies can be misused during the US presidential elections and the effort will be to prevent such activities,” the first person cited above said.Though the joint statement issued after the Quad Summit made no direct reference to China, the people acknowledged that the impact of China’s assertive actions in the area ranging from the East and South China seas to the Line of Actual Control (LAC) figured prominently in the deliberations by the four leaders. US President Joe Biden set the tone for these discussions with his unusually candid observations on China, the people added.Immediately after the Quad Summit, another person familiar with the deliberations had said that the four leaders discussed India’s military standoff with China along the LAC, and the three other members had a “sympathetic view” towards New Delhi on the issue.Former ambassador Rajiv Bhatia, distinguished fellow for foreign policy studies at Gateway House, said: “Quad’s future, which seemed bright after the summit, will partly depend on eventual dynamics between the US and China. It is still early days and the first session of the meeting in Alaska didn’t go well. The outcome is awaited. Within Asean, privately the governments are reportedly happy with the Quad’s vaccine initiative as there is a deficit in access to vaccines and a trust deficit where Chinese vaccines are concerned...”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maritime-security-next-on-quad-s-agenda-key-trilateral-meets-soon-101616175746076.html

As the counting of first preferential votes in the two graduates’ constituencies – Hyderabad-Ranga Reddy-Mahabubnagar and Khammam-Warangal-Nalgonda, ended in the early hours of Friday, the authorities noticed that nearly six per cent of the votes polled turned out to be invalid. In Hyderabad-Ranga Reddy-Mahabubnagar graduates’ constituency, out of a total number of 3,58,348 votes polled, as many as 21,309 votes were declared invalid. Out of 93 candidates in the fray, only four contestants could get more votes than the invalid votes, while all the remaining 89 candidates got lesser number of votes. “Even Telugu Desam Party’s candidate L Ramana secured only 5,963 votes and rebel Congress candidate G Harshavardhan Reddy got 9,783 votes,” an official of the Hyderabad collectorate involved in the counting of votes said. Similarly, in Khammam-Warangal-Nalgonda graduates’ constituency, out of the total number of 3,86,302 votes polled, as many as 21,636 votes were declared invalid. In all, 71 candidates are in fray for this seat, but except four candidates, all the others have polled less than the number of invalid votes. According to the official quoted above, these voters have failed to mark the digits 1, 2, 3 in the boxes provided against the candidates whom they preferred to vote. “Instead, they made tick marks in the boxes or marked their first preferential votes to more than one candidate. Some of them marked the numbers on the names or images of the candidates, instead of in the boxes provided against the names,” he said. Some others wrote their preferences in words, rather than digits, while a few others wrote slogans like Jai Sri Ram, Jai Modi and Jai Telangana and a few others even put forth their demands like: “give us jobs, fill up vacancies.” All such votes were declared invalid. “This is ridiculous. The voters are supposed to be graduates and hence highly educated. How can they behave like illiterate voters? The fact that there is such a huge number of invalid votes indicates that these graduate voters do not have the basic understanding of how to cast their vote,” said political analyst Bhandaru Srinivasa Rao. He felt that too many contestants in the MLC elections might have also led to this confusion among the voters. “The ballot paper was as big as a broadsheet newspaper to accommodate 93 candidates in Hyderabad MLC polls. It could be difficult to identify the candidates of their choice and mark their preferences and that might be the reason for making errors in marking,” Rao said. Former MLC K Nageshwar, who contested as an independent in the present elections again, attributed this to large-scale enrolment of bogus voters by mainstream parties. “However, they did not give proper training to the voters on how to cast their votes. That led to huge number of invalid votes,” he said. The large number of bogus votes also drew criticism on social media. “These so-called graduates who don’t even know how to cast their votes do not deserve government jobs. So, instead of issuing job notifications, it is better the government pays them unemployment allowance,” a netizen commented. Another person observed: “I pity them. Kudos to the teachers who groomed such graduates.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/large-number-of-invalid-votes-in-telangana-mlc-polls-baffles-officials-nominees-101616174799728.html

It is the first visit to India by a top official of the Biden administration.In a tweet after his arrival, Secretary Austin said he was thrilled to be in India and the two countries will work together to address the most pressing challenges facing the Indo-Pacific region."Thrilled to be here in India. The breadth of cooperation between our two nations reflects the significance of our major defense partnership, as we work together to address the most pressing challenges facing the Indo-Pacific region," he said.Earlier in the day, Austin met Prime Minister Narendra Modi and expressed America's strong desire to further enhance the strategic partnership between the two countries for peace, stability and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region and beyond.A PMO release said the Prime Minister welcomed the warm and close relationship between the two countries, which is rooted in shared values of democracy, pluralism and commitment to a rules-based order.PM Modi outlined his vision for the strategic partnership between the two countries and emphasized the important role of bilateral defence cooperation in India-US ties.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ajit-doval-lloyd-austin-discuss-strategic-partnership-defence-cooperation-101616174382661.html
19-03-2021||India||During India visit, US defence secretary Lloyd Austin discusses 'most pressing' challenges facing Indo-Pacific||US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin on Friday expressed his country's strong desire to further deepen strategic ties with India to address the "most pressing" challenges facing the Indo-Pacific as he began a three-day visit to the country that is aimed at expanding cooperation with close partners amidst China's growing assertiveness in the region.Austin, who arrived here as part of his three-nation first overseas tour as the Defence Secretary, called on Prime Minister Narendra Modi and discussed international, regional and bilateral issues of mutual interest, following which Modi tweeted that India and the US are committed to their strategic partnership that is a "force for global good".The US defence Secretary also held wide-ranging discussions with National Security Advisor Ajit Doval and almost all key issues of mutual concerns, including China's aggressive behaviour in the region are learnt to have figured in the deliberations.After the Prime Minister's discussions with Austin, a PMO statement said the US Defence Secretary reiterated Washington's continued commitment towards strengthening the bilateral defence ties and "expressed strong desire" to further enhance the strategic partnership for peace, stability and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region and beyond."Pleasure to meet US Sec Def Lloyd Austin today. Conveyed my best wishes to POTUS Joe Biden. India and US are committed to our strategic partnership that is a force for global good," Modi tweeted.Austin's visit is seen as a reflection of the Joe Biden administration's strong commitment to ties with its close Asian allies and partners. Austin visited Japan and South Korea before India."Thrilled to be here in India. The breadth of cooperation between our two nations reflects the significance of our major defense partnership, as we work together to address the most pressing challenges facing the Indo-Pacific region," the US Defence Secretary tweeted.A readout by the US government said Secretary Austin commended India’s leadership role in the Indo-Pacific and growing engagement with like-minded partners across the region to promote shared goals."The two sides reaffirmed their commitment to promote a free and open regional order. Both sides exchanged perspectives on shared challenges confronting the region and committed to further strengthen their broad ranging and robust defence cooperation," it said.Welcoming Austin, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh said his visit to India is definitely going to further deepen the cooperation and partnership between two countries."Looking forward to our meeting tomorrow," Singh tweeted.On Saturday, Austin will lay a wreath at National War Memorial in the morning, and will be given a guard of honour at Vigyan Bhavan before his talks with Singh, officials said.Ways to further accelerate India-US strategic ties, boosting cooperation in the Indo-Pacific, China's aggressive behaviour in eastern Ladakh, challenge of terrorism and the Afghan peace process are expected to be focus of the talks between Austin and Singh, people familiar with the US official's visit said.They said India's plan to procure around 30 multi-mission armed Predator drones from the US for the three services at an estimated cost of over USD 3 billion is also expected to figure in the talks.The medium-altitude long-endurance (MALE) Predator-B drones, manufactured by US defence major General Atomics, are capable of remaining airborne for around 35 hours and can hunt down targets at land and sea, they said.India's plan to acquire 114 fighter jets at a cost of around USD 18 billion could also figure in the talks as American defence majors --Boeing and Lockheed -Martin-- are eyeing it, the people said.His visit to India came days after the top leadership of the Quad grouping of India, the US, Japan and Australia vowed to expand their cooperation in the Indo-Pacific region.Ahead of Austin's visit, Senator Robert Menendez, Chairman of the powerful Senate Foreign Relations Committee, wrote a letter to the US Defence Secretary, urging him to take up with Indian leaders the issue of New Delhi procuring Russian S-400 missile defence system.Though democracy and human rights issues do not come under the domain of the Pentagon, Menendez also urged Austin to raise these concerns with Indian leaders.In October 2018, India signed a USD 5 billion deal with Russia to buy five units of the S-400 air defence missile systems, notwithstanding a warning from the Trump administration that going ahead with the contract may invite US sanctions.Recently, the US imposed sanctions on Turkey under the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA) for purchase of S-400 missiles from Russia.The evolving situation in the Indo-Pacific region in the wake of China's increasing military muscle flexing has become a major talking point among leading global powers. The US has been favouring making Quad a security architecture to check China's growing assertiveness.The visit is also taking place at a time when India and China are looking to achieve the objective of disengagement from all friction points in eastern Ladakh after completing withdrawal of troops in the North and South banks of Pangong lake areas.Austin and Singh had a telephonic conversation on January 27.The Indo-US defence ties have been on an upswing in the last few years.In June 2016, the US had designated India a "Major Defence Partner".The two countries have also inked key defence and security pacts over the past few years, including the Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Agreement (LEMOA) in 2016 that allows their militaries use each other's bases for repair and replenishment of supplies as well as provides for deeper cooperation.The two sides have also signed COMCASA (Communications Compatibility and Security Agreement) in 2018 that provides for interoperability between the two militaries and provides for sale of high end technology from the US to India.In October last year, India and the US sealed the BECA (Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement) agreement to further boost bilateral defence ties. The pact provides for sharing of high-end military technology, logistics and geospatial maps between the two countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/during-india-visit-us-defence-secretary-lloyd-austin-discusses-most-pressing-challenges-facing-indopacific-101616173858506.html
19-03-2021||India||Farm stir: Anti-social forces trying to thwart resolution, says RSS||Bengaluru: The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), the ideological parent of the Centre’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), on Friday said “anti-national and anti-social forces” were trying to thwart efforts to resolve the standoff between the government and protesting farm unions over the three new farm laws. The RSS’s annual report was released in Bengaluru during a three-day convention of the Akhil Bharatiya Prathinidhi Sabha (ABPS), its highest decision making body of the RSS, that started on Friday.“The problem becomes more serious when anti-national and anti-social forces try to thwart the ongoing efforts towards a solution [farmers’ protest]. The leadership of the present agitation should not allow such a situation to arise,” the RSS said in the report.Thousands of farmers have been camping at Delhi’s borders since November last year, seeking a repeal of the new farm laws, which they say will erode their bargaining power, weaken a system of assured prices, and leave them vulnerable to exploitation by big agri businesses. The government has maintained that the laws aim to ease restrictions on farm trade by setting up free markets, allow traders to stockpile large stocks of food for future sales and lay down a framework for contract farming.In its report, the RSS said that prolonged agitations were counterproductive for all.“It is not in anyone’s interest for any kind of agitation to be prolonged for a long time. Discussions are a must, but with a view to finding a solution. It is possible that not all issues are agreed upon, but it is essential that some agreements must be reached upon,” the report said.It stated that people cannot be given the right to create instability in the country. “In a democracy, all have the freedom of expressing their views but none can be given the right to create disturbance and instability in the country.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farm-stir-anti-social-forces-trying-to-thwart-resolution-says-rss-101616173885698.html

19-03-2021||India||For how many generations reservations in jobs, education will continue: Supreme Court||For how many generations would reservations in jobs and education continue, the Supreme Court sought to know during the Maratha quota case hearing on Friday and raised concerns over “resultant inequality” in case the overall 50 per cent limit was to be removed.A five-judge Constitution bench headed by Justice Ashok Bhushan was vehemently told by senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, appearing for Maharashtra, that the Mandal judgement on capping the quota needed a re-look in changed circumstances.He said the courts should leave it to states to fix reservation quotas in view of the changed circumstances and the Mandal judgement was premised on census of 1931.Arguing in favour of the Maharashtra law granting quota to Marathas, Rohatgi referred to various aspects of the Mandal judgement, also known as Indra Sawhney case, and said the Centre's decision to grant 10 per cent quota to people from economically weaker section also breached the 50 per cent cap.“If there is no 50 per cent or no limit, as you are suggesting, what is the concept of equality then. We will ultimately have to deal with it. What is your reflection on that... What about the resultant inequality. How many generations will you continue,” observed the bench, which also comprised Justices L Nageswara Rao, S Abdul Nazeer, Hemant Gupta and S Ravindra Bhat.Rohatgi said there were many reasons for the re-look of the Mandal judgment which was premised on the census of 1931 and moreover, the population has increased many fold and reached to 135 crore.The bench said 70 years have passed since independence and the states have been carrying on so many beneficial schemes and “can we accept that no development has taken place, that no backward caste has moved forward”.It also observed that the purpose of reviewing the Mandal judgement was that those who have come out from backwardness must be eliminated.“Yes, we have moved forward. But it is not that backward classes have gone down from 50 to 20 per cent. We still have starvation deaths in this country... I am not trying to say that Indra Sawhney is completely wrong, throw it in the dustbin. I am raising issues that 30 years have gone by, the law has changed, the population has grown, backward persons may also have increased,” Rohatgi said.He referred to amendments made in the Constitution and said they are the indicators that the country has not reached “anywhere near the emancipation” it required for its backwards classes.“The fact of the matter is Parliament should know what is going on in the country. If Parliament knows it is more than 50 per cent and has given 10 per cent to a class of economically backward section, no warrant from court should say it cannot go over 50 per cent,” he argued.When a number of states have reservations exceeding 50 per cent and in this situation, it cannot be said that this is not “a burning issue” and does not require a relook after 30 years, he said.The arguments in the case remained inconclusive and would resume on Monday.On Thursday, Attorney General K K Venugopal had told the apex court that the 102nd amendment to the Constitution does not deprive state legislatures to enact law determining the Socially and Educationally Backward Classes (SEBC) and conferring benefits on them.The 102nd Constitution amendment Act of 2018 inserted Articles 338B, which deals with the structure, duties and powers of the National Commission for Backward Class (NCBC), and 342A dealing with power of the President to notify a particular caste as SEBC as also of Parliament to change the list.On Wednesday, the top court was told that Marathas have been dominant “socially and politically” as almost 40 per cent of MPs and MLAs of Maharashtra are from this community and the entire hypothesis that they have been left behind, faced historical injustice is completely flawed.The top court has been hearing a clutch of cases challenging the Bombay High Court verdict which upheld the grant of quota to Marathas in admissions and government jobs in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/for-how-many-generations-reservations-in-jobs-education-will-continue-supreme-court-101616172304845.html

"India crosses milestone of 4 crore Covid-19 vaccinations," the ministry tweeted.As of March 18 evening, 7,635,188 healthcare workers were administered with the first dose of Covid-19. The corresponding number for healthcare workers administered with the second dose is 4,715,173. As many as 2,779,998 beneficiaries aged more than 45 years with specific comorbidities received the first dose along with 141,77,766 beneficiaries aged more than 60 years.Click here for complete Covid-19 coverageOn January 16, India rolled out its vaccination drive in the country and currently, it is the second country after the United States to vaccinate the highest number of people. Only healthcare workers and frontline workers were allowed to be immunised in the first phase of the vaccination drive. In the second phase, which began on March 1, the government permitted those above 60 years and 45+ with commodities to be included in the drive.Earlier in the day, speaking in Parliament, Union health minister Harsh Vardhan said that the vaccination drive will be extended in the coming days. "Every vaccine doesn't require universal immunisation and all these priority groups whom we are vaccinating today like healthcare staff first and then senior citizens and people aged between 45 and 59 years, it will be extended in the coming days – all these are based on experts' opinion," the health minister said.He also urged people to not have any misconceptions about the two Indian vaccines that are being administered in the country. "There are detailed pre-clinical and clinical trials, which get thoroughly studied by the experts before a vaccine gets the nod, the minister said, adding that "There should not be any misconception regarding the Covid-19 vaccines and the people should avail the facilities given by the government and get themselves vaccinated," he also said.India is currently using two vaccines for the inoculation drive: Covishield, developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca and manufactured by the Serum Institute of India and Bharat Biotech's Covaxin.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-latest-milestone-india-crosses-4-crore-vaccination-mark-health-ministry-101616170461635.html

The home ministry has also said that the rise in Covid-19 cases is largely due to laxity of people, particularly in crowded places, while asking the states/UTs to follow the Covid-19 guidelines issued by it on January 27 urging people to follow Covid-19 appropriate behaviour. It has also alerted that due precaution must be taken considering the festival season, particularly Holi, is coming up. Over 39,000 cases, the highest since November 28, were reported across the country on Thursday out of which over 25,000 were reported from Maharashtra alone. “After the steady decline in Covid-19 cases for about 5 months, for the last few weeks, the number of Covid-19 cases are showing an increasing trend in several parts of the country. It has been observed that it is largely due to laxity in the observance of Covid-19 appropriate behaviour by the people, especially in crowded places,” Union home secretary Ajay Bhalla said in his letter to states on Friday. “Keeping in view the fresh surge of cases and upcoming festivals, it will be important to ensure compliance of the guidelines and to strictly enforce Covid-19 appropriate behaviour, such as wearing of face masks, hand hygiene and social distancing among people,” he added. He urged all the states to take measures for creating awareness among people to follow Covid-19 appropriate behaviour and simultaneously take necessary action for its strict enforcement, so as to fully overcome the pandemic. In its January 27 guidelines, MHA had opened up all economic activity across the country. There are no signs of any sort of lockdown by the Centre as yet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/alarmed-over-covid-19-surge-mha-writes-to-states-asks-for-compliance-with-norms-101616169925732.html
19-03-2021||India||Uttarakhand CM 'apologises' for 'ripped jeans' remark, but says wearing them 'is not right'||Facing flak over his "ripped jeans" comment, Uttarakhand Chief Minister Tirath Singh Rawat on Friday said he apologises for the remark if it has hurt anybody.But at the same time, he repeated his objection to ripped jeans, saying he has no problem with jeans with but wearing "torn" ones is "not right".Referring to his remark made earlier this week, Rawat told the media that he had commented that nowadays children bring a costly jean home and then cut it with a scissor.He had only talked about the environment at home and this applies to him as well, Rawat said.If we inculcate good values and discipline in children, they will never fail in future, the CM added, stressing that he had made the comment at a programme held to keep the children away from intoxicants and other evils.Describing himself as a man from a rural background, Rawat on Friday said whenever his pant was torn in schooldays, he feared that his teacher would scold him. Due to discipline and values, we used cover it with a patch, he said.Rawat had drawn flak after at an event earlier this week he said youngsters follow strange fashion trends due to a lack of values and consider themselves to be big shots after wearing jeans ripped at the knees.

Conveyed my best wishes to @POTUS @JoeBiden.

He requested Secretary Austin to convey his best wishes to President Biden,” Modi’s office said in a statement.During the meeting, Austin reiterated the US government’s continued commitment towards strengthening the bilateral defence relations between the two countries, the statement added. The US secretary also expressed “US' strong desire to further enhance the strategic partnership for peace, stability and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region and beyond”.Soon after landing, Austin tweeted that he was thrilled to be in India. “Thrilled to be here in India. The breadth of cooperation between our two nations reflects the significance of our major defense partnership, as we work together to address the most pressing challenges facing the Indo-Pacific region,” he posted on the microblogging site.Thrilled to be here in India.

This year the Jammu and Kashmir government has been making arrangements for six lakh pilgrims to the cave shrine nestled in the South Kashmir Himalayas at a height of 13,000 feet. The 56-day pilgrimage will commence from June 28 and end on August 22. Thousands of pilgrims either trek the traditional and longer 45km-long Pahalgam route in Anantnag district or the shorter 14km-long Baltal route in Ganderbal district to the shrine every year. “Like every year, the yatra arrangements are being done. There is a set drill and we know what kind of security is required on the highways, camps, community kitchens and on the twin tracks of Pahalgam and Baltal. The arrangements are being done on the same pattern,” the DGP told reporters at the police training school in Sunjuwan here. He said that all the requisite security arrangements will be put in place “There are no specific threats to the yatra but sticky bombs are indeed a new challenge. It was not there earlier but forces inimical to India including the neighbouring country are always hell bent upon creating disturbance. It is a new thing. It is a small IED with a magnet, which can be easily planted in vehicles and metals. It is a threat but we have our security drills and will take care of them,” he said. Dilbagh Singh’s statement comes a day after CRPF’s Inspector General (Jammu zone) PS Ranipse said that all CRPF units and formations have been briefed about the threat posed by sticky bombs. On the government’s efforts to wean away the youth from terrorism and bring them back to the mainstream, Singh said, “Such efforts are on for the past few years and in 2020 at least three dozen such youth shunned the path of violence on the request of their parents. They are now living a peaceful life.” The DGP said that the process was still on. “Our endeavour is that youth should be weaned away from it and they should be stopped from going astray. After shunning the path of violence they also realize it (futility of gun) and express gratitude to the security forces for saving their lives and bringing them back to the mainstream,” he said. “And, now even during the encounters we give opportunity to the terrorists to surrender. At least a dozen such terrorists surrendered during the encounters last year and we will continue this process,” he added. On anti-insurgency operations, he said that the security forces achieved big successes in Kashmir this year. “In north Kashmir a top commander of Lashkar-e-Taiba, Gani Khawaja was killed and similarly Jaish commander Sajjad Afghanhi was killed in Shopian. Then two top commanders of Lashkar-e-Mustafa and the TRF-Hidyatullah Malik and Zahoor Ahmad Rather were captured alive in Jammu,” he said. The police chief said that security forces have killed 12 terrorists so far this year and three dozen others belonging to various modules were arrested.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-threat-to-amarnath-yatra-but-sticky-bombs-a-new-challenge-j-k-dgp-101616164344705.html

The state also recorded 70 related fatalities in the said timespan which took the death toll to 53,208, according to heath department data.Maharashtra's capital Mumbai recorded 3,063 cases of the infection and 10 related fatalities which pushed the caseload to 3,55,914 and death toll to 11,569, respectively.Also Watch: How India can avoid Lockdown 2.0The number of active cases in the city is 20,140. Mumbai also saw 1,334 people recover from the infection, which took the total recoveries to 3,23,281.The number of cases in Mumbai and Maharashtra have been rising rapidly, worrying the experts who say the state is witnessing a second wave of Covid-19. From the peak of the infection last year, the cases started declining late last year, but a resurgence in March 2021 has alarmed the Centre too.In October 2020, Mumbai recorded 2,848 cases - its highest ever then - but in March this year, the record has been broken already. After recording 2,877 cases on Thursday, the city saw its 24-hour tally cross the 3,000-mark.Maharashtra too recorded 25,833 Covid-19 cases on Thursday, its highest one-day spike since the pandemic began.Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Friday said lockdown is an option but he trusts people to follow the norms on their own. Talking to reporters in Nandurbar, Thackeray also appealed people to get vaccinated against the virus without fear.The state government released fresh guidelines on Friday, imposing restrictions on gatherings and putting in place other curbs. As per the new guidelines, drama theatres and auditoriums in Maharashtra have been asked to operate only at 50 per cent capacity. Private offices, except those related to health and other essential services, have also been asked to function only at 50 per cent of their capacity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-records-25-681-new-cases-of-covid-19-mumbai-breaks-3000mark-101616163821705.html
19-03-2021||India||US defence secretary Lloyd Austin lands in India; visit to boost security ties||In the first visit by a top Biden administration official, US Defence Secretary Lloyd J Austin arrived in India on Friday on a three-day visit, aimed at further boosting bilateral defence and security ties in the wake of China's growing military assertiveness in the region including in the Indo-Pacific.India is the third stop for Austin during his three-nation first overseas tour as the Defence Secretary, and the visit is seen as a reflection of the Joe Biden administration's strong commitment to its relations with its close allies and partners in the region. The US defence secretary visited Japan and South Korea before India.The US official was received at the Palam airport by senior Indian military officials and diplomats from the American embassy.Ways to further accelerate India-US strategic ties, boosting cooperation in the Indo-Pacific, China's aggressive behaviour in eastern Ladakh, challenge of terrorism and the Afghan peace process are expected to be focus of the talks between the two sides, people familiar with Austin's visit said.They said India's plan to procure around 30 multi-mission armed Predator drones from the US for the three services at an estimated cost of over $3 billion is also expected to figure in the talks.The medium-altitude long-endurance (MALE) Predator-B drones, manufactured by US defence major General Atomics, are capable of remaining airborne for around 35 hours and can hunt down targets at land and sea, they said.India's plan to acquire 114 fighter jets at a cost of around $18 billion could also figure in the talks as American defence majors --Boeing and Lockheed -Martin-- are eyeing it, the people said.Secretary Austin is scheduled to meet National Security Advisor Ajit Doval on Friday evening while he will have extensive talks with Defence Minister Rajnath Singh on Saturday.He is also likely to meet External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar. Before his departure on Sunday, Austin is likely to call on Prime Minister Narendra Modi.His visit to India came days after the top leadership of the Quad grouping of India, the US, Japan and Australia vowed to expand their cooperation in the Indo-Pacific region.Ahead of Austin's visit, Senator Robert Menendez, Chairman of the powerful Senate Foreign Relations Committee, wrote a letter to the US Defence Secretary, urging him to take up with Indian leaders the issue of New Delhi procuring Russian S-400 missile defence system.Though democracy and human rights issues do not come under the domain of the Pentagon, Menendez also urged Austin to raise these concerns with Indian leaders.In October 2018, India signed a $5 billion deal with Russia to buy five units of the S-400 air defence missile systems, notwithstanding a warning from the Trump administration that going ahead with the contract may invite US sanctions.Recently, the US imposed sanctions on Turkey under the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA) for purchase of S-400 missiles from Russia.The evolving situation in the Indo-Pacific region in the wake of China's increasing military muscle flexing has become a major talking point among leading global powers. The US has been favouring making Quad a security architecture to check China's growing assertiveness.The visit is also taking place at a time when India and China are looking to achieve the objective of disengagement from all friction points in eastern Ladakh after completing withdrawal of troops in the North and South banks of Pangong lake areas.Austin and Singh had a telephonic conversation on January 27.The Indo-US defence ties have been on an upswing in the last few years.In June 2016, the US had designated India a "Major Defence Partner".The two countries have also inked key defence and security pacts over the past few years, including the Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Agreement (LEMOA) in 2016 that allows their militaries use each other's bases for repair and replenishment of supplies as well as provides for deeper cooperation.The two sides have also signed COMCASA (Communications Compatibility and Security Agreement) in 2018 that provides for interoperability between the two militaries and provides for sale of high end technology from the US to India.In October last year, India and the US sealed the BECA (Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement) agreement to further boost bilateral defence ties.The pact provides for sharing of high-end military technology, logistics and geospatial maps between the two countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/us-defence-secretary-lloyd-austin-lands-in-india-visit-to-boost-security-ties-101616162422783.html
19-03-2021||India||On Pakistan army chief's 'move forward' remark, a comeback from Punjab CM||Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Friday told Pakistan’s army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa to “walk the talk” as the latter made a pitch for peace between the two nations on Thursday saying the onus lies on India to initiate talks for improving bilateral ties by addressing Kashmir.“Bajwa should first control his ISI, and then talk about stability in Indo-Pak relations,” the chief minister said, adding that India cannot afford to go soft with Pakistan till they walk the talk and prove their sincerity with solid actions.Singh’s statement comes a day after Bajwa said it was time for India and Pakistan to "bury the past" and move forward as that would help to "unlock" the potential of South and Central Asia. The Pakistan army chief said that the potential for regional peace and development always remained hostage to the disputes and issues between Pakistan and India - the two "nuclear-armed neighbours". He, however, said that responsibility for a meaningful dialogue rested with India.In a sharp comeback to Bajwa, Singh said, “Infiltration into India from across the border is still happening, Indian soldiers are being killed at the borders every day. They (Pakistan) are dropping arms and heroin into Punjab via drones every other day. Efforts to create trouble in my state continue to take place. All this should stop first, only then we can talk peace.”Pointing to the differences with their country, the chief minister said, “Are they all of the same view as shared by General Bajwa? Are they withdrawing all support to terror groups immediately? Have they asked ISI to back off and leave India alone?”“India is all for peace, all Indians stand for peace, but India cannot compromise on its security and integrity,” he stressed, adding that peace cannot be conditional.Bajwa’s remarks came a month after the militaries of India and Pakistan announced a ceasefire along the de facto border in Kashmir.In response to similar remarks “offering a hand of peace”, India had last month asserted that the onus is on Pakistan to create an environment free of terror and hostility.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/on-pakistan-army-chief-s-move-forward-remark-a-comeback-from-punjab-cm-101616162353241.html
19-03-2021||India||Govt hikes lower fare band by 5%, may impact domestic flight ticket prices||The Centre on Friday increased the lower fare band in the domestic sector, a move which will affect the prices of the flight tickets. The information was shared by Union civil aviation minister Hardeep Puri on Twitter."There has been a continuous rise in price of ATF (aviation turbine fuel) so it has been decided to increase the lower fare band by 5% keeping the upper fare band unchanged," he tweeted."We may open the sector for 100% operations when daily passenger traffic crosses 3.5 lakhs on 3 occasions in a month," Puri said in the same tweet.There has been a continuous rise in price of ATF so it has been decided to increase the lower fare band by 5% keeping the upper fare band unchanged. We may open the sector for 100% operations when daily passenger traffic crosses 3.5 lakhs on 3 occasions in a month.This is the second time that the government has increased fare limits for domestic airlines. The first hike was introduced in February this year.Except the ATF, India's fuel demand has returned to pre-Covid levels, the chief of Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) said earlier this week. "ATF may take a quarters time to return to normal, maybe 3-4 months," said IOC chairman Shrikant Madhav Vaidya.With airlines not operating all flights, ATF sales remain below normal.In the wake of Covid-19 pandemic, domestic flight operations were ceased with effect from midnight of March 24, 2020. The operation resumed after two months on May 25, 2020.Last month, the civil aviation ministry said that the number of domestic flights that Indian airlines are permitted to operate will remain at 80 per cent of their pre-Covid levels till March 31 or till the summer schedule begins.Scheduled international commercial flights continue to remain suspended, while overseas flights under air bubble agreements and the Vande Bharat Mission are operational, among others.Meanwhile, India's economy returned to positive growth territory in the fourth quarter of 2020 as its real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) expanded by 0.4 per cent year-on-year after two quarters of contraction. This was after provincial and localised lockdowns were lifted amid a fall in the daily number of new Covid-19 cases.In 2020, India's GDP contracted by 7 per cent, but it is forecast to grow by 9 per cent in 2021.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-hikes-lower-fare-band-by-5-may-impact-domestic-flight-ticket-prices-101616162023270.html
19-03-2021||India||Andhra assembly to skip budget session, vote-on-account likely for few months||The Andhra Pradesh government is likely to go in for promulgation of an ordinance for approval of a vote-on-account budget for the initial few months of the 2021-22 financial year, instead of convening the budget session of the assembly. It is mandatory that the approval of the annual budget for the coming financial year and passage of the appropriation bill by the state assembly happens before the closure of the present financial year on March 31. Without the passage of the appropriation bill in the assembly, the state government cannot draw a single rupee from the exchequer after April 1, for spending on implementation of various programmes and even for payment of salaries to government employees. The budget session of the Telangana assembly began on March 15. The Telangana government tabled its annual budget for the financial year 2021-22 on Thursday and is preparing for a debate on it from Saturday. However, the Jagan Mohan Reddy government has not yet taken any decision on convening the budget session of the state assembly, though hardly 12 days are left for the conclusion of the financial year. “We have not taken a call yet on the budget session of the assembly till now, but it is unlikely that the session will be held in the present circumstances,” said senior YSR Congress party leader and government chief whip in the state assembly G Srikanth Reddy. He said holding of the budget session would become inconvenient for not only the government but also the opposition parties in the wake of announcement of the schedule for by-election to the Tirupati parliamentary seat. “We are also insisting on completion of the elections to Zilla Parishad and mandal parishad (block parishad) at the earliest. Amidst the electioneering, it may not be possible to have a full-fledged budget session,” Reddy said. The only option before the Jagan government is to promulgate an ordinance through the Governor under Article 213 (1) of the Constitution of India for the adoption of a vote-on-account budget for appropriation of money and release of approximate budgetary allocations for at least three months. “Instead of hurrying through the budget in a short-duration, we can have a full-fledged budget session of the assembly at a later date and the budget can be passed after a thorough discussion in the House,” the chief whip said. The state cabinet is expected to meet next week to adopt a draft ordinance to pass the vote-on-account for the first three months of the 2021-22 financial year and get it approved by Governor Biswa Bhushan Harichanan. Last year, too, Jagan government could not convene the budget session of the state assembly in early March as it was planning to hold the same in the last week after the completion of elections to urban and rural local bodies. However, the state election commission deferred the elections in the wake of the outbreak of the Coronavirus pandemic and by the time the government took any decision, the situation turned very serious forcing the Centre to announce a nationwide lockdown. As a result, the government had to go in for promulgation of ordinance for the vote-on-account for three months. In the second week of June, it held a short two-day budget session to adopt the budget. The Governor had to address the joint session of the assembly and council through video conferencing mode in view of Covid-19 restrictions. However, the appropriation bill, which was passed by the assembly, was withheld in the legislative council. Two weeks later, the bill was deemed to have been passed and the Governor gave his assent to the same.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/andhra-assembly-to-skip-budget-session-vote-on-account-likely-for-few-months-101616160984030.html

Other states are Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Punjab, Madhya Pradesh, Delhi, Gujarat, and Haryana.On Thursday, the state added 1,488 new cases to its tally in a span of 24 hours, which pushed the total positive cases to 9.65 lakh, according to state health department. Eight more people lost their lives to the infection after which the toll rose to 12,415. Thursday was the third consecutive day when the state reported more than 1,000 new cases.Bengaluru reported the highest - 925 - cases followed by Dakshina Kannada (64 cases), Kalaburagi (59 cases), Bidar (53 cases), and Mysuru (49 cases).Bengaluru urban district tops the list of positive cases, with a total of 4,14,410, followed by Mysuru 54,633 and Ballari 39,439.Earlier, Yediyurappa chaired a meeting with senior officials and members of the Covid-19 technical advisory committee. During the meeting, experts raised concerns over the surge of Covid-19 cases and said that it is an indication of a second wave.Meanwhile, the Centre is actively engaging with all state governments and union territories, especially those showing an uptick in daily new cases and with a high caseload of active cases, the ministry said. On March 17, Prime Minister Narendra Modi held a meeting with state chief ministers to evaluate the Covid-19 situation. During the meeting, PM Modi urged all states and UTs to ramp up testing in line with the 'Test Track and Treat' strategy of the government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-pre-prepared-to-handle-covid-19-surge-says-health-minister-as-cases-rise-101616157967560.html
19-03-2021||India||Maharashtra CM Uddhav Thackeray sees ‘lockdown as an option’ amid Covid-19 spike||A day after Maharashtra witnessed the highest spike in daily Covid-19 cases, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Friday said that lockdown looks like an option that the state government might have to choose if people fail to follow the protocols in view of the pandemic."I see lockdown as an option going ahead. But I trust people of the state to cooperate (and follow the Covid-19 norms voluntarily) like the last time," he was quoted as saying by the news agency PTI.Follow latest updates on Covid-19 hereThackeray’s remarks came shortly after the state government issued fresh guidelines restricting private offices and drama halls, theatres and auditoriums to operate at 50% capacity. The heads of government offices have been asked to decide regarding the functionality of their respective workplaces.Pointing to the situation when the pandemic was at its peak last year, Thackeray said that there was nothing to fight the virus with then. “Number of Covid-19 patients had increased in September 2020 as well. But today we have vaccine as a shield,” he said, adding that the priority now is to ensure that everyone is inoculated and urged people to come forward to take the vaccine.On Thursday, Maharashtra logged a single-day spike of 25,833 Covid-19 cases taking the tally to 2,396,340. The toll from the viral disease has gone up to 53,138. This is the sharpest one-day increase so far. On September 11, the state reported the previous highest single-day cases at 24,886.Due to the surge in cases since February, several Maharashtra districts have already been placed under ‘partial’ lockdown. Amid the concernes raised by experts about the "beginning of the second wave" in the state, the Thackeray government has time and again warned the people of a lockdown and urged them to adhere to Covid-19 appropriate behaviour.However, at a review meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday, Thackeray said that he is not in favour of lockdown but indicated that a strict lockdown might be imposed in some areas of the state as it is a 'majboori' (helplessness)."Do not force us to impose a strict lockdown. Consider this as the last warning. Follow all the rules. Everyone has to realise there is a difference between self-discipline and restrictions," the chief minister warned hotels and restaurants last week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-cm-uddhav-thackeray-sees-lockdown-as-an-option-amid-covid-19-spike-101616157359262.html

China's territorial claims in the South China Sea and its efforts to advance into the Indian Ocean are seen to have challenged the established rules-based system. Moreover, China has criticised the framework as an Asian version of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation seeking to undermine its legitimate rise.The Indian defence ministry said that Austin's visit to India as part of his first overseas travel emphasises the strength of the India-US strategic partnership.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/us-defence-secretary-lloyd-austin-arrives-in-india-to-meet-nsa-ajit-doval-101616157497981.html

19-03-2021||India||Covid-19 vaccination drive to be extended in coming days: Harsh Vardhan||Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan on Friday said the Covid-19 vaccination drive will be extended in the coming days and asserted that there should not be any misconceptions about the two Indian vaccines being administered in the country.During the Question Hour in Lok Sabha, Vardhan said India has vaccinated 3.5 to 4 crore people so far and side effects of the vaccines has been recorded at 0.000432 per cent. "Every vaccine doesn't require universal immunisation and all these priority groups whom we are vaccinating today like healthcare staff first and then senior citizens and people aged between 45 and 59 years, it will be extended in the coming days – all these are based on experts' opinion.      "Not only Indian experts, but we have also consulted WHO guidelines regarding priority groups," he said. Serum Institute's Covishield and Bharat Biotech's Covaxin have been currently approved for restricted emergency use in India.Replying to a question by NCP MP Supriya Sule on whether the government is aiming at universal immunisation of Covid-19 vaccine, Vardhan said it is not scientifically necessary to administer the vaccine to each and every person in the country. "Not each and every person in the world will be vaccinated. The prioritisation process is a dynamic process. "The behaviour of the virus is also dynamic. All things are based on scientific facts, scrutiny and vision of the overall scientific and health community," he said.           The minister said under India's present universal immunization programme, free vaccines are provided against 12 vaccine-preventable diseases, including Diphtheria, Pertussis, Tetanus, Polio, Measles, Rubella, severe form of Childhood Tuberculosis, Hepatitis B and Meningitis, among others.     Replying to a question by Congress MP Ravneet Singh Bittu about the fear in people that the Covid-19 vaccine will harm them in the future, Vardhan asserted that taking vaccines is the way to get rid of vaccine-preventable diseases.   "We got victory over polio and chicken pox due to the vaccination," he said.     There are detailed pre-clinical and clinical trials, which get thoroughly studied by the experts before a vaccine gets the nod, the minister said, adding that "There should not be any misconception regarding the COVID-19 vaccines and the people should avail the facilities given by the government and get themselves vaccinated." Vardhan further noted that there is a well-defined group of experts called the National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration (NEGVAC)).    "What you are seeing today is the hard work of the people in the ministry and this group, which was set up by the prime minister in August. "Since then, they have been working closely regarding all scientific developments related to this," he said.     The minister also pointed out that the Subject Expert Committee has cleared two Indian vaccines (Covishield and Covaxin) after examining data provided by these companies. Data provided by two Indian companies was also examined by the World Health Organisation, he added.Vardhan also informed the House that India would soon launch several more COVID-19 vaccines following their pre-trials and clinical trials phases."There is no single standard method to manufacture vaccines...Indian vaccines fulfil safety, efficacy, and immunological parameters," he said.According to the recommendations of NEGVAC, the vaccination of people aged 60 years and above and those aged between 45 to 59 years with 20 identified comorbidities started in the country from March 1.      Replying to questions on Thalassemia, Vardhan, "Not a single thalassemia patient was deprived of blood during the COVID-19 pandemic period," he noted and said blood is provided free of cost to these patients.Thalassemia major and the severe form of Thalassemia Intermedia (TI) constitute the major burden of disease and both are commonly managed by regular lifelong blood transfusions and iron chelation.     These syndromes are caused by inheritance of abnormal (beta) thalassemia genes from both parents or abnormal beta - thalassemia gene from one parent and abnormal variant haemoglobin gene (HbE, HbD) from the other parent.The minister said in the last one year, 75 medical colleges have been sanctioned by the government."A total of 30,000 Health and Wellness centres were opened under the Ayushman Bharat scheme in the last one year during the Covid-19 pandemic period," he said.Vardhan also said during the last six years 24,000 new post graduate medical seats have been created.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-vaccination-drive-to-be-extended-in-coming-days-harsh-vardhan-101616156960463.html

19-03-2021||India||After SC order, Delhi HC refuses to hear plea seeking for vaccinating judges lawyers on priority||The Delhi High Court Friday refused to further hear a PIL to declare all people associated with the judicial functioning, including judges, court staff and lawyers, as “frontline workers” to enable them to get Covid-19 vaccination on priority in view of the Supreme Court's order staying the proceedings.A bench of Justices Vipin Sanghi and Rekha Palli adjourned sine-die the hearing in the PIL which was initiated by the high court on its own.The apex court on Thursday had stayed proceedings in the Delhi High Court on giving priority to the legal fraternity for administering Covid-19 vaccine and favoured transferring the suo motu case on the issue to itself for adjudication.The Centre has opposed creating a separate class of lawyers and said that though it is not opposed to the legal fraternity members but tomorrow journalists and banking sector employees may also come forward seeking priority in vaccination.During the brief hearing, central government standing counsel Anil Soni informed the high court that in the seven district courts here, the facility of Covid-19 vaccination for lawyers, who are eligible for it as per the policy, has started.The Delhi High Court and all the district courts here have resumed full-fledged physical functioning from March 15.Earlier, the Centre had told the high court that the decision for Covid-19 vaccination is based on vulnerability of citizens to the disease and is not profession wise and the government is sensitive to the needs of the country.Bharat Biotech and Serum Institute of India (SII), the country's leading Covid-19 vaccine manufacturers, had told the high court that adequate capacity of vaccines was available for the vaccination of judicial staff, advocates and judges as frontline workers. The PIL was initiated to examine the demand to declare all people associated with the judicial functioning, including judges, court staff and lawyers, as “frontline workers” so that they could receive Covid-19 vaccination on priority and without limitations of their age or physical condition.As per the current policy, those above 60 years of age or between the age of 45 to 59 years with comorbidities are eligible for the vaccination.The government has said that rather than going by profession, the government is starting with vulnerability to Covid-19 infection.The high court had on March 4 asked the Centre to explain the rationale behind keeping strict control over class of persons who can be vaccinated against Covid-19 currently as under the present system those above the age of 60 years or with comorbidities can receive vaccination.It had said the two institutes which have developed the vaccines COVISHIELD and COVAXIN -- Serum Institute of India and Bharat Biotech -- have more capacity to provide the vaccines but it seems that their full capacity is not being exploited.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-sc-order-delhi-hc-refuses-to-hear-plea-seeking-for-vaccinating-judges-lawyers-on-priority-101616152166039.html

After my husband lodged the complaint, they threatened him with dire consequences and now they killed him.” Devi said after hitting Valimiki, the attackers allegedly threatened the passers-by against informing the police or helping him, saying they would face the same fate if they intervened. “My husband...[pleaded for help] but nobody helped him.”Police superintendent Vinayak Verma said Ahmed and his sons have been arrested and booked for the murder.Also Read | Man arrested for murder of parents, 2 other family members in Chhattisgarh“Santram was returning home on Thursday when Rizwan, who was [at the tractor wheel]...hit his bike with the tractor.

Later, police reached the spot, and he was rushed to a hospital where the doctor declared him brought dead.” He added Ahmed who was not present at the crime spot, but he has been arrested for conspiracy to kill Valimiki. Vidisha collector Pankaj Jain said Valimiki had lodged the complaint about encroachment and the forest department on March 16 formed a team to remove it. “The anti-encroachment drive started on Friday.”The incident triggered tensions in the area as Vishwa Hindu Parishad and local ruling Bharatiya Janata Party lawmaker Umakant Sharma staged a protest and demanded tough action against the accused. A heavy police force was deployed in the area and the gathering of more than four people has been prohibited.Sharma accused police and administration of supporting the encroachers. “Had the administration and police acted timely, Santram would not have been killed. A local police station in-charge was patronising the mafia and he should be removed from the post.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/man-mowed-down-for-raising-voice-against-encroachment-in-mp-s-vidisha-district-101616156483441.html

19-03-2021||India||'India not a dharamshala': Haryana minister says collecting info about Rohingyas||Haryana home minister Anil Vij said on Friday that his government is collecting information about presence of Rohingyas Muslims in the state. Vij's comments came after several reports claimed that the Rohingyas have been gather in Haryana's Mewat district."We are collecting information about them. Action will be taken accordingly. After all, India is not a dharamshala (an inn or small hotel) where anybody can stay where they like. We will look into this," the minister was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.Earlier, several news reports claimed that Rohingyas have been taking shelter in the Nuh village of Haryana's Mewat district.They have been found in other parts of the country too. On March 6, over 150 Rohingya refugees were sent to a holding centre in Jammu as part of the Jammu & Kashmir administration’s process to identify undocumented immigrants in the Union Territory under the Foreigners Act. The administration has said it will work on their deportation to Myanmar.The Supreme Court has agreed to hear a plea seeking the release and protection of these refugees.Rohingyas are a minority in Myanmar’s Rakhine, where an intense military crackdown - likened to an ethnic cleansing by the United Nations - has driven hundreds of thousands to flee to countries such as Bangladesh and India.Certain political parties and social organisations have urged the Centre to take immediate steps for the deportation of Rohingyas and Bangladeshis alleging that their presence is a "conspiracy to alter the demographic character" of the region and "a threat to the peace in the region".The issue is a sensitive one for the central government. Last month, India’s Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador T S Tirumurti spoke at the informal UN General Assembly meeting on the situation in Myanmar after the military staged a coup this month. He emphasised the need for an early return of displaced Rohingyas from Bangladesh to Myanmar, saying that India has the highest stake in resolving the issue since it is the only nation that shares a long border with both countries.Tirumurti also urged the international community to ensure that the recent developments in Myanmar do not impede the progress made so far.Myanmar military seized the power on February 1, detaining the country's de-facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi. The military coup took place at a time when Bangladesh was spearheading a desperate campaign for safe return of some 1.1 million Rohingyas.Bangladesh is hosting over 1.1 million Rohingya refugees in Cox's Bazar, who fled Myanmar facing military crackdown, often considered as "ethnic cleansing" by many rights groups.Myanmar doesn’t recognise Rohingya as an ethnic group and insists that they are Bangladeshi migrants living illegally in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-not-a-dharamshala-haryana-minister-says-collecting-info-about-rohingyas-101616154316212.html

19-03-2021||India||Bombay HC allows daughter to challenge validity of father's second marriage||The Bombay High Court has held that a daughter can question in court the validity of her father's second marriage. In a judgement pronounced on Wednesday, a bench of Justices RD Dhanuka and VG Bisht allowed the plea filed by a 66-year-old woman challenging a family court order that held only parties to the marriage could challenge the validity of the marriage.As per the judgement, the woman filed a plea in the family court in 2016, challenging the validity of her late father's second marriage. In the plea, she said her father had remarried after her mother's death in 2003, but it was in 2016, after her father's death, that she realised her father's second wife was yet to finalise her divorce from her previous marriage. Her father's second marriage, therefore, could not be considered as valid, the woman said in her plea.The second wife, however, argued before the family court that the petitioner had no locus standi in the matter as only the two parties to a marriage, that is the husband and the wife, could challenge its validity in court.The HC held that the petitioner discovered the truth about the woman's divorce much after her father's death and that she had approached the family court as soon as she learned of the discrepancy. Since her father was dead, it was for her to bring the discrepancy forward and challenge the validity of such a marriage, the court said.The bench said the family court was wrong in holding that the daughter was barred from questioning the validity of her father's marriage. It sent the plea back to the family court to decide afresh."We cannot concur with the reasoning and conclusion arrived at by the learned Family Court which wrongly dismissed the appellant's petition," the HC said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bombay-hc-allows-daughter-to-challenge-validity-of-father-s-second-marriage-101616151493212.html
19-03-2021||India||Sabarimala temple issue: CM Pinarayi Vijayan says everything going on smooth now||With the opposition parties in Kerala continuing to target the ruling LDF on the Sabarimala issue, Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Friday maintained that as of now everything was going on smoothly at the hill shrine and the matter would come up only when the Supreme Court delivers the final verdict.Asking why the party should be worried about it now, he told reporters in Pattambi in Palakkad district if any issue crops up after the final verdict it would be discussed with all sections of society."Now, the matter will come up only when the final verdict is issued by the constitution bench of the apex court. Our stand is that when the final verdict comes out, and if any issue crops up at that time, we will discuss the matter with every section of the society. Why are we worried about it now?" he asked.The state had witnessed widespread violent protests led by a section of devotees led by BJP and other right wing outfits against the state government decision to implement the Supreme Court order allowing entry to women of all ages into the hilltop shrine.He also said the ruling Left front would have more seats in the Assembly after the April 6 elections."There is no doubt that we will get more seats than the last time," Vijayan said in response to a question onthe number of seats expected by the Left Front.Vijayan attacked the BJP and the Congress-led UDF and said the infamous "Co-Le-B alliance" is now a public deal and was an attempt to weaken the Left movement in the state.He also said the Left doesn't need the support of communal parties to gain acceptance among the people and asked "those who want to protect secularism in the country to observe" the Kerala-level alliance of the "Congress-League-BJP (Co-Le-B)".Vijayan was responding to the statements of the lone BJP legislator in Kerala, O Rajagopal, that there were "adjustments" between UDF partners Congress and IUML and his party in past elections in order to defeat the CPI(M).The chief minister said both the BJP and Rajagopal benefited from that alliance and received the Congress votes at Nemom."Now it is public that the Congress had ties with the BJP earlier also. They are trying to forge the same alliance in this election too. People have to be careful. Those who want to protect secularism in the country need to observe these matters carefully," he added.He said, earlier this "adjustment between these parties" was not in the open but now certain UDF candidates have publicly announced that those who voted for BJP last time will vote for them in this election."Now it's not a secret deal but an open adjustment. The people are watching," he said.Asked about Palakkad BJP candidate E Sreedharan's recent comment reported by some media that apart from the Palarivattom project, the state government was not cooperative in developing infrastructure in Kerala, Vijayan said "even experts who join BJP, tend to show that party's traits"."He (Sreedharan) is a major technocrat in our country. Even experts who join BJP, tend to show that party's traits. So he too may have reached a certain point where he would end up saying anything," the Chief Minister said.Referring to the recent decision of the central government to "sell hundreds of public sector undertakings", Vijayan attacked the Congress and the BJP saying "both the parties share the same policy of globalisation and privatisation".He said Congress was the "proponent" of this policy and cited the example of Congress leader and Thiruvananthapuram MP Shashi Tharoor backing the handover of the International Airport in the state capital to Adani Group."Now the BJP-ruled central government has decided to sell around hundred public sector undertakings in the country. Have they (Congress or UDF) raised any objection towards this? No. Because it's the Congress who are the real proponents of this policy."It was decided to privatise the Trivandrum International Airport. The Left government here opposed but the Lok Sabha memberfromThiruvananthapuram supported it. The globalisation policy was initiated by the Congress," Vijayan said.He said Kerala has been opposing the globalisation policy and "implementing an alternate model"."Those who are opposing the globalisation and privatisation including the farmers and others are looking towards Kerala with hope. We have put forward an alternative policy," he said.The lone Communist chief minister saidthe country was keenly observing the steps taken by the Left government to protect secularism in the state and with a "Kerala-level understanding, the Congress, the UDF and the BJP" are trying to weaken the Left movement in the state".He said there are attempts to attack the secular values and the Constitution of the country andpeople rejecting or returning awards are also a form of protest against destroying the secular fabric of the nation."Secularism can be protected only by taking a strong stand against communalism and only the Left parties have been opposing the anti-secular forces. There are conscious efforts to destroy secularism and the Constitution of this country. The country is keenly observing the steps taken by the Left government to protect secularism in the state," he said.Vijayan is touring the districts of the state as part of the election campaigning for the Assembly elections scheduled on April 6.The results will be out on May 2.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sabarimala-temple-issue-cm-pinarayi-vijayan-says-everything-going-on-smooth-now-101616151184710.html

Passenger train operations taken up through Public Private Partnership (PPP) is targeted to bring a total investment of about ₹ 30,000 crore," Goyal said.Replying to a supplementary asked by Jairam Ramesh of the Congress, Goyal said he felt the Opposition member was not able to understand the difference between privatisation and monetisation."When you privatise, you sell off the assets permanently and it no more remains a part of the government ownership. In the railways, the plan to is monetise in terms of how it will generate resources, further investment and growth. The infrastructure of Indian Railways will never be privatised," Goyal said.The Railways Minister said dedicated freight corridors are a separate corporate entity and the railways is supporting them."The Railways is supporting but is not the owner of tracks that the DFC is laying …If we raise funds by leasing them, giving them out to private sector to use in the interim period we are doing a service to the nation," the minister said.The Ministry of Railways is committed towards enhancing the pace of infrastructure development, which is vital for the national economy as a whole, he said.The railways would always be a key economic driver in the strategy of investment-led economic growth, he said.The minister said assets monetisation involves various transaction processes, and the investment expected depends on the outcome of bidding process open to public and private sectors."Therefore, the actual investment expected from private and public sectors cannot be ascertained as of now," he added.Goyal said modern train is the need of the day, and the railways has got historic ₹2.15 lakh crore allotment under Prime Minister Narendra Modi.If a road is built, everyone uses it, similarly if a pipeline is built by GAIL and they only use it, it will be misused, he said."Similarly, if new rail tracks are laid and private people are invited and encouraged to operate there, it will be run by locopilots, there will be caterers, so it will generate employment and not lead to job losses," he said.In reply to a supplementary raised by the leader of the opposition in the Upper House Mallikarjun Kharge about a proposal to merge three divisions of Gulbarga in Karnataka, Goyal said the Railways Board did not find it feasible.He said proposals made by Zonal Managers are sent to the Board for a holistic view with an all-India perspective. He, however, added that he will discuss the issue with Kharge separately.In a reply to another supplementary, he said for seven routes dedicated to semi-high speed passenger corridors, the government is talking to state governments and added that there has been good response from the Uttar Pradesh government which is cooperating on the Delhi-Varanasi route, mostly elevated along the highways.He said under PM Modi's leadership instead of just haphazard announcements, which he alleged used to be the case earlier, committed plans are being made and it is being ensured that the rail infra is augmented in the entire country instead of just a few places.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/railways-infra-will-never-be-privatised-assets-to-be-monetised-piyush-goyal-101616148249897.html

But 25-year-old Rajkumar Nayak from Jhalipada village of Kandhamal district instead ended up acting in Malayalam movie Jallikattu, India’s official entry to Oscar this year.Nayak played the role of a Bangladeshi in Jallikattu, a movie revolving around a buffalo that escapes from the local butcher’s farm and runs amok till it is finally captured. “I never dreamt that one day I would act in a movie that was nominated for Oscar awards. It was beyond my imagination,” said Nayak, now a resident of Angamaly town of Kochi in Kerala. Jalikattu was Nayak’s 6th movie in the last 4 years.One of the four sons of a daily labourer in tribal-dominated Kandhamal district, Nayak’s each day was earlier defined by struggle. “After finishing my high school exam in 2012, I enrolled in Netaji Subhas higher secondary school in Tumudibandh. However, my father could no longer pay for my tuition fees and I had to drop out,” said Nayak.In 2012, he left for Angamaly town of Kerala’s Kochi, along with a few of his friends, to work as a waiter in a hotel, where he also washed dishes and learnt cooking. While working at the hotel, he joined a local gym, where he came in contact with Anson Antony, a gym instructor and a supporting actor in Malayalam movies.It was Antony who helped Nayak get the cook’s job at Malayalam director Lijo Jose Pelissery’s house. “The director and his team were very impressed with my cooking. In 2017, director sir (Pellissery) asked whether I could act. I said I had not done it ever but will give it a try. They offered me a small role in the film Ea Ma Yu. I completed the 20 second shot in one take. The director praised me and assured help in building a career in acting,” he said.Thereafter, he signed one film after another. After Ee Ma Yu, he acted in Addu 2, Swatantra Ardharatri, Whal Nachetra and Kadathanadan Katha.Director Pellissery, who directed Jallikattu, said Rajkumar was a wonderful actor. “I know him for the past 3-4 years and he is a wonderful actor and very hardworking. I would love to see Rajkumar in a few Odia films,” he said. Nayak himself wants to get a break in Odia movies.In his native village, Rajkumar’s family as well as fellow villagers are proud of him and wished to see him in Odia films. “People of our village are praising my son. He has made me proud,” said Kamaldei Nayak, his mother.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odia-migrant-labourer-from-kandhamal-becomes-actor-in-malayalam-movies-101616146822052.html

19-03-2021||India||Centre urges Delhi HC to restrain WhatsApp from implementing new privacy policy||The central government has urged the Delhi High Court to restrain WhatsApp from implementing its new privacy policy and terms of service, news agencies reported on Friday.The Centre urges Delhi High Court that WhatsApp may be restrained from implementing its new privacy policyThe Centre informed the court that in view of rising concerns over data protection and privacy, it has framed the Data Protection Bill, 2019, to "limit the ability of entities" such as WhatsApp. This, the government reasoned, is necessary for ushering in a "robust regime" on data protection of internet users, LiveLaw reported.The Facebook owned-messaging platform has been facing global criticism recently over its new privacy policy, under which the app could share limited user data with Facebook and its group firms.WhatsApp's privacy policy poses an added challenge for the Indian government. The privacy situation in this country is unlike that in the European Union (EU), where users get more control over how tech platforms handle their personal data, thanks to the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Even under the new privacy policy, WhatsApp users in the EU get an additional option called "managing and retaining your information", which lets them rectify, erase, or update any private information that the platform controls.Since India lacks a regulatory authority, the country faces a hurdle in policing tech companies over their handling of user data, that is, until the data protection act comes into force.The government had earlier this month sought more time from the court to examine the issue regarding WhatsApp's new privacy policy, which it believes provides 'differential treatment' to Indian users. In the last hearing, the central government had told the Delhi High Court that the issue is a "matter of concern" as the messaging application policy differs for users in the European Union.The Centre has contended that not giving users an option to opt out raises "grave concerns regarding the implications for the choice and autonomy of Indian citizens". Union Minister of State for IT and Communications Sanjay Dhotre informed the Lok Sabha two days ago that the central government has asked the messaging platform to review its privacy policy changes.WhatsApp, for its part, has clarified that the new policy changes nothing for private messages between friends and family as these are end-to-end encrypted and neither Facebook nor WhatsApp can see those texts. It said that only in some specific conditions can WhatsApp read "business messages" and share the data with Facebook to help those businesses with targetted ads and user optimisation on partner platforms.Issues ranging from provocative and inflammatory content to misinformation to data breaches have placed social media companies including Facebook, WhatsApp, and Twitter on the line of fire over the past many months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-urges-delhi-hc-to-restrain-whatsapp-from-implementing-new-privacy-policy-101616144346998.html

Kesari dal’s production and sale was banned in the country in 1961 for containing a neurotoxin that causes lathyrism – a disease marked by tremors, muscular weakness, and paraplegia or paralysis affecting the lower half of the body. The ban was lifted in 2016 after reports from Indian Council of Medical Research and the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India said its consumption in smaller quantities was safe.Districts of Aurangand, Navada, Jahanabad, Bhojpur, Rohtash, Nalanda and east Champaran are cultivating dal variants with lower levels of the neurotoxin, Oxalyldiaminopropionic acid (ODAP), under a project by the department of biotechnology .Under the project, the two variants – Ratan and Prateek – that were demonstrated in three districts of Bihar resulted in an ODAP content within the permissible limit of 0.1% and led to higher yields. In the two years under the project, the average yield in Gaya, Lakhisarai, and Patna for Ratan was 12.01 quintals per hectare, for Prateek 11.5 quintals per hectare, and for local variants 9.9 quintals per hectare, according to the project’s progress report.Also Read | No proposal to hike PDS prices of food grains under NFSA, says Piyush GoyalThe higher yield and low ODAP content as compared to local variants, and low input needed in general for grass pea, increased farm incomes -- an estimated financial gain of ₹27,500/hectare per season through its cultivation in rice fallows, according to the report. It also addressed the shortage of pulses, provided protein-rich diet to the farmers, and provided feed for livestock.“Earlier the few farmers who did grow grass peas used it for livestock feed and not for their own consumption. Due to the government ban, there was a negative perception among the people about the dal so we had to work hard to explain that the new variants had very low quantities of ODAP. The project grew slowly as the word spread among farmers,” said Dr Chandan Kumar Panda, who is working on the project at Bihar Agriculture University, the institution leading the project in the state. Dr Dutta said that the variants with low ODAP content are likely to have more acceptability among people. In addition, the university also started a seed buy-back policy to develop an effective production chain of quality seeds. This also made growing the variants lucrative for farmer with seeds being bought at the cost of ₹4,200 per quintal. By the end of March 2020, the university had a stock of 150 quintals of seed.Farmers Interest Groups were created for the cultivation and buy-back of the seeds. “Once convinced the new grass pea varieties Ratan and Prateek are safe for human consumption, the farmers agreed to take up cultivation of these varieties and also shared this information with fellow farmers,” the report said.Experts, however, said that the variants were unnecessary as the crops grown in India were already safe for consumption. “The measurement of quantity of ODAP is unnecessary. A person would have to consume 1,100 grams of the pulse every day for three months to possibly get lathyrism, even then it is not a sure shot thing. Once you cook a dal, it expands three times in quantity. Now, tell me who is drinking so much dal? No case of lathyrism has been reported from Bangladesh where there is a very high consumption of Kesari dal,” said Dr Shantilal Kothari, an activist, microbiologist and nutrition expert, who was one of the people who worked to get the ban revoked.Also Read | Adani Group clarifies it does not buy food grains from farmers; only manages storage for FCI“Also, any modified variant is likely to go back to producing the same amount of ODAP, depending on soil and climactic conditions,” he said.Dr Swapan K Dutta, former deputy director general (crop science) at the Indian Council of Agricultural Research said, “The Kesari dal that is currently commercially available does not have high enough ODAP to cause harm to humans and is safe for consumption. The reason for the restrictions at the time (in 1961) was the drought-like conditions leading to higher ODAP production in the crop. In addition, a famine-like situation meant that people ended up having higher quantities of Kesari dal, which is a hardy crop that can survive in a drought, in the absence of anything else.”He added that lifting of the ban had led to reduction in import of pulses. “In 2014 and 15, we were struggling to meet the demand of dal in the country and were importing enormous quantities each day; today we are in a good shape. We still need to produce more pulses so that they become cheap and the protein rich food source is available to all,” said Dr Dutta.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bihar-to-promote-kesari-dal-variants-with-lower-levels-of-neurotoxin-101616144001480.html

According to reports, this new rule will come into effect from March 22, next Monday. The restriction has been announced a day after the city recorded the highest-ever single-day spike with 2,877 fresh cases on Thursday. With 17,153 active cases, the Mumbai district now has the third-highest number of active infections in the country.While several districts of Maharashtra have brought back night curfews, local restrictions, there has been no decision on imposing similar curbs in Mumbai. Mumbai currently has 34 active containment zones and 267 buildings sealed. The authorities have also revealed that the maximum of the new infections reported in the last two months has been from apartments. Between March 17 and 18, the BMC authorities traced 14,979 high-risk contacts, its latest bulletin said. The civic authorities are also penalising night clubs, wedding hall authorities, individuals for flouting rules.As about 95 per cent of the new cases in Maharashtra are asymptomatic, testing and tracking are most important to contain the spread of the infection, the state government said. On Thursday, Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray held a virtual meeting with divisional commissioners and asked them to ensure that restrictions are not being violated.What are the news rules in Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation areas?> No religious/cultural/political gathering allowed> Cinemas (single screen/multiplex) and hotels to operate at 50% capacity> 50 people allowed for weddings & 20 for funerals> All offices, except health & essential, to operate at 50% - work from home advised.> Residential buildings with more than five active Covid-19 patients will be sealed.> Compulsory 7-day institutional quarantine for travellers coming to Mumbai from Brazil.> Hands of citizens instructed to quarantine at home will be stamped.> Marshals appointed to take action against those travelling in local trains without masks.> Regular inspection at halls, wedding venues.> Citizens flouting these rules will be fined, prosecuted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-negative-report-mandatory-to-enter-shopping-malls-in-mumbai-101616141550595.html
19-03-2021||India||ED, Kerala police on collision course over gold smuggling probe||The Kerala police crime branch on Friday lodged a case against the Enforcement Directorate (ED) for allegedly trying to implicate chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan in the gold smuggling case as the state's election draws near.This comes after some of the accused in the case recently alleged that they had been forced to take big names by the ED and two police officers who were escorting the accused gave a statement mentioning that they had overheard the ED officials' threats in this regard. Another police official said that she was a witness to ED officials threatening the main accused in the gold smuggling case, Swapna Suresh.This move leads to the state police flexing their muscles with the Central agency. The police had received legal advice that they could register a case against a Central agency for threatening, false implications, and other charges. However, legal experts have said that ED officials could not be implicated so easily by the state police.On July 5, 2020, the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs had seized 30kg of 24 karat gold worth over ₹14 crore at the Thiruvananthapuram airport which was supposed to be delivered to the UAE Consulate in the city.The National Investigation Agency (NIA) probe named Swapna Suresh as one of the accused and after further investigation, it was found that CM Pinarayi Vijayan's principal secretary M Sivasankar had links to Suresh. Sivasankar was suspended and eventually removed from his postThe customs department had, on March 5, told the Kerala High Court that CM Vijayan, three of his ministers and the Speaker knew of the gold smuggling activities through the United Arab Emirates (UAE) consulate in Thiruvananthapuram.The chief minister had said that the Trivandrum airport, which was under the Centre's control, was a hub for gold smuggling and asked Union home minister Amit Shah for answers at a public gathering in Kannur on March 9."Trivandrum Airport is completely under the control of the central government. How did Trivandrum airport become a hub for gold smuggling after the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) came to power? Amit Shah should answer it. Not Kerala CM but Amit Shah has the responsibility to answer it," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ed-kerala-police-on-collision-course-over-gold-smuggling-probe-101616138226880.html

Addressing an interaction in Lahowal, Dibrugarh in the state, Gandhi also slammed the BJP at the Centre for the decline in democracy, increasing unemployment amongst youth, Citizenship Amendment Act(CAA) and farm laws protest.Click here for complete coverage on assembly electionsReferring to Bharatiya Janata Party’s ideological mentor, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) headquarters in the city of Nagpur, he said one force from Nagpur is trying to control the entire country."You think democracy is declining. Youth is unemployed, farmers are protesting, CAA is there. The question is what is India? People from different cultures, languages, religions make up India. We can't ask the people of Assam to forget their culture, history and language if they come to Delhi. The day we say this, the idea of India ends . One force, born in Nagpur, trying to control the whole country," Gandhi said.During the student interaction ahead of the Assam assembly elections, Gandhi urged the youth to actively participate in politics and fight for the state when they feel the state is being robbed by an outside force. Democracy means the voice of Assam should control Assam, he added."Democracy means the voice of Assam should control Assam. If we don't include students then there can be no democracy. Youth should actively participate in politics and fight for Assam when you feel the state is being robbed. You will have to fight with love not with stones, lathis," said the Wayanad MP.Interacting with one of the students, the Congress leader said the biggest sale the government is doing is that of the agriculture sector. Reiterating his 'hum do hamare do' stance against the Narendra Modi-led BJP government, he said the new farm laws are an attempt to privatise the sector and hand it over to big businesses.Also Read | ‘Every vaccine doesn't require universal immunisation': Harsh Vardhan in LSGandhi also took a dig at the Prime Minister when one of the students said that PM Modi only comes to the state during elections. "During flood, you cannot give him anything so he does not come but during elections, you can give him votes, so he comes," he said.The BJP spreads hate, increases unemployment while the Congress works to erode hate, Gandhi said during the interaction, emphasising that the focus of Congress in Assam is to fill the vacancies in government jobs, create employment, put money in healthcare and education sector, develop tea gardens and empower the youth.The elections in 126 assembly seats in Assam will take place in three phases beginning from March 27 and ending on April 6.

Meetings will be on broad issues, not a detailed exchange of specifics,” said a senior government official.India is the third stop of Austin’s three-nation tour, an effort by the Biden administration to bolster a united front against China which was famously described by Austin as the “pacing threat”.“China … presents the most significant threat going forward because China is ascending,” Austin told the Senate confirmation hearing back in January, underlining that in contrast to Beijing, the threat from Moscow “is in decline”.“Our goal is to make sure that we have the capabilities and the operational plans and concepts to be able to offer credible deterrence to China or anybody else who wants to take on the US.”Austin’s arrival in Delhi coincides with a crucial meeting between top officials of the Biden administration and President Xi Jinping’s China in Alaska. By all accounts, this is expected to be a difficult meeting with Washington determined to red flag its concerns around several issues such as human rights in Tibet, Hong Kong, Taiwan and western Xinjiang region apart from China’s assertiveness in the neighbourhood. These are issues that Xi Jinping’s party believes the Biden administration should steer clear of.US secretary of state Antony Blinken amped the pitch well before the meeting starts, referring to Beijing’s “consistent failure to uphold its commitments” and its “aggressive and authoritarian behaviour” that challenges the stability of the Indo-Pacific region.This is an issue that is also going to be discussed when Austin holds meetings with top Indian leaders.The US defence secretary is scheduled to call on Prime Minister Narendra Modi after 6pm today to deepen bilateral defence cooperation and further Quad. His formal meeting with his counterpart, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, is slated for tomorrow.The former US Central Command chief will also hold talks with National Security Advisor Ajit Doval; the two sides are expected to discuss ways to deepen bilateral cooperation and counter-terrorism.As the 12th Central Command chief, Secretary Austin is well versed with the threat to global security from radicalization and terrorism after seeing the rise of the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. He also has first-hand experience of the threat posed by terrorist groups in Pakistan to India.Officials said the Indian side is expected to brief the visiting dignitary about the on-going stand-off with China in the East Ladakh region where the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) is still to disengage from Gogra-Hot Springs and Depsang areas.Rather than complete the disengagement from the entire stretch of the Line of Actual Control, Beijing has been going slow on withdrawing troops from the friction points. China wants Delhi to bracket the boundary dispute separately from bilateral ties and resume the economic relationship unmindful of what happened in May 2020 on the north banks of Pangong Tso and elsewhere.The US, which has tracked the East Ladakh stand-off very closely, is quite clear on PLA aggression and has a firm idea about PLA’s capability in the Western Theatre with India. The friction between the two countries in the East Ladakh sector was also discussed when leaders of the four-nation Quad grouping held their first summit and vowed to hold a second in-person meeting later this year.The discussion at Austin’s meetings in Delhi would be much more granular..The two sides are not expected to sign any agreements during Secretary Austin’s visit but they do hope to firm up the roadmap to deepen defence cooperation and intelligence sharing in the Indo-Pacific. This will be done through interoperability exercises and joint training designed to make them the first responders in the vast ocean while the navies of the two other Quad members, Japan and Australia, hold the other fringes. The Quad navies plus France are scheduled to exercise in the Bay of Bengal from April 4-7 under the La Perouse banner.India and the US have robust defence technology cooperation with Washington now willing to offer a number of high-end technologies for manufacture in India under the “Atmanirbhar Bharat” rubric. Among items that could be considered are aircraft engines, long-range drones, aircraft and multi-utility helicopters. India has already firmed up its plans to buy Predator drones from the US apart from more sea surveillance aircraft.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/east-ladakh-stand-off-with-china-on-us-top-official-lloyd-austin-s-india-agenda-101616138720467.html

Not each and every person in the world will be vaccinated. The prioritisation process is a dynamic process. The behaviour of the virus is also dynamic. All things are based on scientific facts, scrutiny and vision of the overall scientific and health community, ” the minister said.“There is a well-defined group of experts called National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration. What you are seeing today is the hard work of the people in the ministry and this group, which was set up by the Prime Minister in August. Since then, they have been working closely with all scientific developments related to this,” the minister said.Under India’s present universal immunization programme, free vaccines are provided against 12 vaccine-preventable diseases, including Diphtheria, Pertussis, Tetanus, Polio, Measles, Rubella, severe form of Childhood Tuberculosis, Hepatitis B and Meningitis, etc.Answering another question from Congress MP Ravneet Singh Bittu over the efficacy of the Covid-19 vaccines, the minister said that vaccines are the way to get rid of vaccine-preventable diseases. There are detailed pre-clinical, clinical trials, which get thoroughly studied by the experts before a vaccine gets the nod.

Efforts were being made to trace them, but the possibility of their death due to infighting cannot be ruled out, they added.The people said the movement of the tigers was last captured on camera in the reserve’s non-tourism zone in March 2020. The two sub-adults were second litters of tigress T-73, who is among the missing big cats.An official of the reserve, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said it is spread over 1,700 square km area that also includes dense forests. That the tigers have gone missing cannot be confirmed in haste, the official added. The official said the tigers may have moved out and gone to Madhya Pradesh. Such movements have been reported earlier too.Also Read | Karnataka registers 37% jump in tiger attacks in 2020-21 from last yearThe official emphasised that there are limited cameras installed in the forest areas and sometimes they do not capture the movement of big cats.

In its editorial on Friday in Saamana, the party mouthpiece, Sena said his transfer does not mean he is guilty.The bomb scare incident outside industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s house Antilia in February led to the major shake-up in the city’s police force. On Wednesday (March 17), Param Bir Singh was transferred to a low-key post in Home Guard and senior IPS officer Hemant Nagrale was made the new commissioner, after the National Investigation Agency (NIA) arrested Mumbai police officer Sachin Waze and claimed that there are many other players involved in the case.Watch | 'Param Bir Singh transferred to aid probe in Sachin Waze case': Anil Deshmukh“The government has to do the rejig in police under certain specific circumstances. Param Bir Singh was replaced in the post of Mumbai Police Commissioner, which doesn't mean he is guilty. He took the command of the post of Mumbai Police Commissioner during very difficult times," read the editorial, as reported by news agency ANI. It also took a note of Singh’s commitment towards the fight against Covid-19, as he went to Dharavi, which was a hotbed of infections last year.Broaching the cases of Sushant Singh Rajput and TRP scam, Sena wrote that a lobby in Delhi had grudges against him, following the unearthing of the TRP scam.Seeking justification of an NIA (National Investigation Agency) probe into the case, Sena asked what the terror angle is in this case. "NIA investigates matters related to terrorism. But despite not having any link to terrorism, the agency has been handed over the case. What is the matter? What probe did the NIA do in the Uri attack, the Pathankot attack, and the Pulwama attack? How many criminals have been arrested? This too is a mystery. But 20 gelatin sticks in Mumbai seems to prove to be a big challenge for NIA," it wrote.An explosive-laden SUV was found parked outside Antilia on February 25. Twenty-odd gelatin sticks and a threat letter were found. The SUV was traced to Thane-based businessman Mansukh Hiran who was found dead soon after the incident – on February 5.

He said that this was another achievement of the BJP government's "eradicate employment campaign"."You lost your job and had to close down your EPF account. Another achievement of the Central Government's 'eradicate employment campaign'," he said in a tweet in Hindi.The unnamed news report claimed that a large number of people lost their jobs during the coronavirus pandemic and 71 lakh EPF accounts were closed in nine months.Gandhi has been attacking the government over the handling of the farmers agitation and the pandemic, claiming many people lost their jobs during the lockdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rahul-gandhi-attacks-govt-for-not-paying-tributes-to-farmers-who-lost-lives-during-protest-101616114040738.html
19-03-2021||India||Olive Ridley turtle mortality declines in Odisha this year: Official||The number of deaths of Olive Ridley sea turtles along the Odisha coast has come down this year as the state forest department has taken various measures for the protection of the endangered marine species and their habitats, an official said.Around 2,575 carcasses of Olive Ridleys have been counted in the current year so far, while 6,320 fatalities were reported in the 2019-20 nesting season."The decline in the number of turtle deaths is encouraging as the forest department has been taking measures to protect the marine species," the official said.However, the Orissa High Court has recently directed the state government to enforce a prohibition on fishing activities by trawlers near the mouth of Devi river and along the coast to protect the marine species.Based on a report submitted by a committee, the court observed that there is "incidental killing of turtles due to suffocation in fishing nets or by injuries inflicted by the propellers of the trawlers".The Olive Ridley turtles turn up in millions for mass nesting along the Odisha coast every year.Gahirmatha beach in Kendrapara district is acclaimed as the world's largest-known nesting site for the endangered marine species.Apart from Gahirmatha, turtles turn up at the mouths of Rushikulya and Devi river for mass nesting.Around 7.30 lakh olive ridley turtles had turned up for their annual sojourn of mass nesting in the 2019-20 season.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/olive-ridley-turtle-mortality-declines-in-odisha-this-year-official-101616113432305.html
19-03-2021||India||Uttarakhand govt to allow completion of 7 hydel projects||The Centre has decided to allow the completion of seven under-construction hydropower projects in Uttarakhand, a top official in the environment ministry said, indicating the government’s desire to push ahead with these projects despite opposition from activists and local residents, which has resurfaced again in recent weeks following the February 7 flash flood on the Rishi Ganga that claimed at least 72 lives and damaged two projects.The decision has been taken by the ministries of environment, power and Jal Shakti, and will be communicated to the Supreme Court, which is hearing a matter on hydropower projects, this person added on condition of anonymity.“Those hydropower projects which have completed 50% of construction will be allowed to go ahead,” this person said.Union environment minister Prakash Javadekar, too, tweeted on March 15 his response to a question in Rajya Sabha that sanctioned projects will be allowed to go ahead, but no new projects will be initiated in the upper reaches on Ganga.The projects at Tapovan Vishnugad (520 MW) on Dhauliganga river which was completely destroyed in the February 7 glacier breach; Vishnugad Pipalkoti (444 MW) on Alaknanda river; Tehri Stage II (1000 MW) on Bhagirathi river; Singoli Bhatwari (99 MW) on Mandakini river; Phata-Buyong (76 MW) on Mandakini river; Madhyamaheshwar (15 MW) on Madhmaheshwar Ganga; and Kaliganga II (6 MW) on Kaliganga river all meet this criterion.“Most of the under-construction projects that the Centre plans to go ahead with are located in extremely sensitive areas in the vicinity of the paraglacial zone and are to the north of MCT. These include Tapovan Vishnugad, Vishnugad Pipalkoti, Phata Byung, Singoli Bhatwari, Madhmaheshwar and Kaliganga. Phata Byung was completely buried in the 2013 disaster, Singoli Bhatwari was also destroyed. The Centre should have decommissioned these under-construction projects immediately after the 2013 disaster. The focus should shift to conserving the Himalayas and not making them further vulnerable to disasters by allowing these projects,” said Hemant Dhyani, member of the Supreme Court-appointed expert body to study the environmental impact of hydropower projects.MCT or main central thrust is a geological fault that lies along the Himalayas.Following the 2013 Uttarakhand flash floods which killed at least 5,000, the Supreme Court on August 13, 2013 ruled that no new hydroelectric power projects should be set up in the state. In all, 69 projects were envisaged in the region at the time; 24 had been granted environmental clearances, which were also stayed by the apex court.The court sought a detailed assessment of the cumulative impact of hydropower plants in the state. Following the order, a committee headed by Ravi Chopra, director of the People’s Science Institute, submitted a detailed report which warned that glacial retreat in the state, coupled with structures built for hydroelectricity generation and dams, could lead to large-scale disasters downstream.It also underlined that paraglacial zones (above 2,000 metres) and areas north of the main central thrust are extremely vulnerable to landslides, Glacial Lake Overflow Floods, and hence not ideal locations for hydropower projects.Subsequently, the top court, in its order dated January 24, 2015 in Alaknanda Hydro Power Co. Ltd Versus Anuj Joshi & Ors, directed a common policy framework to be created by the ministries of environment, Jal Shakti, and power for implementation of projects in the upper reaches of the Ganga.That process took time.Minutes of a meeting held in the chamber of the principal secretary to the Prime Minister on February 25, 2019 said that no new hydropower project would come up on the Ganga or its tributaries in Uttarakhand, but made an exception for the seven projects under construction where 50% of the work was complete.Now, the ministries are ready to present their conclusion to the court.“This shows that the government is turning a blind eye to recurrent disasters. The only rationale to allow these seven is that the money has already been spent but that doesn’t mean you have to go ahead with faulty and risky propositions,” said Mallika Bhanot, an Uttarakhand based environment activist associated with Ganga Ahvaan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-govt-to-allow-completion-of-7-hydel-projects-101616113075080.html

19-03-2021||India||Mumbai top cop shunted to ensure fair probe: Minister||Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh on Thursday said that former city police commissioner Param Bir Singh was shunted out due to “serious and unpardonable mistakes” committed by some of his colleagues in the commissionerate, in what were his first comments after Wednesday’s high-profile transfer.Crime Intelligence Unit (CIU) head Sachin Vaze was removed and arrested recently in connection with the explosives found in a car parked outside industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s home last month.“The transfer of Mumbai Police commissioner was to ensure the ongoing probe by the National Investigation Agency and the state anti-terrorism squad is not hampered. The decision was taken collectively in the meeting chaired by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray,” Deshmukh said.While NIA is probing the explosives found in a Scorpio parked outside the Ambani residence, Antilia, on February 25, ATS is investigating the death of Thane-based businessman Mansukh Hiran, who is linked to the Scorpio. “Maharashtra Police has been doing a fantastic job. Its morale is high, but the entire force is made to bear the brunt of the mistakes committed by a few officers. Those officers, be it an API (assistant police inspector) or senior rank officer, will not be spared if found guilty. Singh was the commissioner and the case [of explosives] was under his jurisdiction. Vehicles belonging to the commissionerate were used in the incident. Drivers and colleagues were found to be involved in the case, and so a thorough probe is a must,” he said.NIA has so far seized five vehicles, including a white Innova that belonged to the CIU and was found in the Motor Transport Department of the state police, in Nagpada area, as well as a black Mercedes-Benz parked in the premises of the Azad Maidan police station.Deshmukh denied the claim made by leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis who said that CM Uddhav Thackeray recommended Vaze’s reinstatement in the police force. Deshmukh also refuted speculation that his position in the cabinet was under a cloud.“It is a political allegation levelled by Fadnavis. The decision related to the reinstatement of any officer of the rank of API is done at the level of police commissioner. A five-member committee headed by the commissioner, comprising other high-ranking officers at the Commissionerate, take the decision after a review. There was no question of appointing Vaze at the government level. CM or home minister deal with the reinstatement of officers of the rank above additional superintendent of police,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mumbai-top-cop-shunted-to-ensure-fair-probe-minister-101616101206750.html

A PE is the first stage of any investigation by the CBI.According to the FIR filed by the CBI, the 2017 enquiry revealed that the chocolate firm had proposed a manufacturing unit in Baddi in 2007 in order to avail area-based excise and tax exemption. To avail the same, some members of the executive board of the company, along with key managers, collectively manipulated records, engaged intermediaries to route bribes to government officials and covered up evidence, the FIR added.Cadbury officials, the CBI said, “paid bribes, misrepresented facts and manipulated records to fraudulently avail area-based exemption benefits (central excise and income tax) in Baddi, Himachal Pradesh, knowing fully well that they were not entitled to avail area-based tax exemption benefits”.Instead of expanding production by creating a unit, Cadbury decided to increase the production capacity in its existing unit and avail tax exemption from May 2005, the FIR said.Mondelez India said it was yet to receive any formal communication in this regard from the authorities.Among those named in the FIR include Cadbury’s then vice president (finance) Vikram Arora, Rajesh Garg (former director, finance) and former director Jaiboy Phillips (then director, supply chain).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cbi-raids-in-haryana-and-himachal-on-mondelez-foods-premises-101616100711443.html

19-03-2021||India||Patriarchal justice won't do: SC lays down the law||The Supreme Court on Thursday directed all courts in the country to desist from commenting upon the dressing, behaviour, past conduct, morals or chastity of women, or suggest any “compromise formula” while deciding cases of sexual offences, emphasising that “entrenched paternalistic and misogynistic attitudes that are regrettably reflected at times in judicial orders’’ must be forbidden.The court issued a slew of directives, along with a checklist for judges, to eliminate social bias from entering judicial reasoning. A bench of justices AM Khanwilkar and S Ravindra Bhat set aside a July 2020 order of the Madhya Pradesh high court asking a molestation case accused to get a rakhi tied on his wrist by the complainant as a condition for bail. The top court held that this order transformed a molester into a brother by judicial mandate and, thus, reflected adversely on the entire justice delivery system.“This is wholly unacceptable and has the effect of diluting and eroding the offence of sexual harassment. The law does not permit or countenance such conduct, where the survivor can potentially be traumatised many times over or be led into some kind of non-voluntary acceptance or be compelled by the circumstances to accept and condone behaviour what is a serious offence,” it said.Writing the judgment for the bench, justice Bhat handed out a checklist for the judges on what must be avoided during judicial proceedings and could never become part of an order, saying the use of reasoning or language which diminishes the offence and trivialises the survivor has to be avoided under all circumstances.“Thus, the following conduct, actions or situations are hereby deemed irrelevant, e.g. to say that the survivor had in the past consented to such or similar acts or that she behaved promiscuously, or by her acts or clothing, provoked the alleged action of the accused, that she behaved in a manner unbecoming of chaste or “Indian” women, or that she had called upon the situation by her behaviour, etc,” the bench said.Bail conditions and orders, the court said, should avoid reflecting stereotypical or patriarchal notions about women and their place in society, besides ensuring no contact between the accused and the complainant as a condition for bail. “In other words, discussion about the dress, behaviour, or past ‘conduct’ or ‘morals’ of the prosecutrix (survivor), should not enter the verdict granting bail,” said the court, adding that judges should show extreme sensitivity in such cases and desist from expressing any stereotype. Justice Bhat listed out 12 examples of stereotypical opinions, including comments on how a “good” woman and a “good” mother should behave in society; being alone at night or wearing certain clothes makes women responsible for being attacked; a woman consuming alcohol, smoking, etc may justify unwelcome advances by men or “has asked for it”; or a suspicion around a sexually active woman in assessing consent in sexual offence cases.The bench clarified that these instances were only illustrations of an attitude, which should never enter judicial orders or be considered relevant while making a judicial decision, and added that the idea was that the “greatest extent of sensitivity is to be displayed in the judicial approach, language and reasoning adopted by the judge”.Underlining that judges had to play a vital role as teachers and thought leaders, the bench directed that courts should not suggest, entertain or encourage any steps towards a compromise between a complainant and the accused to get married, or any other form of settlement between them. Accepting the suggestion by attorney general KK Venugopal and by lawyer Aparna Bhat, who along with eight other women lawyers had challenged the Madhya Pradesh high court order, the apex court also ordered that a module on gender sensitisation be included as part of the foundational training of every judge. It asked the National Judicial Academy to devise, preferably within three months, necessary inputs which have to be made part of training of young judges, as well as form part of judges’ continuing education on gender sensitisation.The bench asked the Bar Council of India to consult subject experts and circulate a paper for discussion with law faculties and colleges and universities in regard to courses that should be taught at the undergraduate level, in the LLB programme, in addition to including topics on sexual offences and gender sensitisation in the syllabus for the All-India Bar Examination.In its 24-page judgment, the bench higlighted that violence against women in India was systematic and was usually underpinned by the persistence of patriarchal social norms and inter- and intra-gender hierarchies.“Women are discriminated against and subordinated not only on the basis of sex, but on other grounds too, such as caste, class, ability, sexual orientation, tradition and other realities. Gender violence is most often unseen and is shrouded in a culture of silence...This silence needs to be broken. In doing so, men, perhaps more than women have a duty and role to play in averting and combating violence against women,” held the court.It regretted that outlaw behaviours such as stalking, shades of verbal and physical assault, and harassment were categorised as minor offences. “Such ‘minor’ crimes are, regrettably not only trivialised or normalised, rather they are even romanticised and therefore, invigorated in popular lore such as cinema. These attitudes – which indulgently view the crime through prisms such as ‘boys will be boys’ and condone them – nevertheless have a lasting and pernicious effect on the survivors,” lamented the bench. The challenges Indian women face are formidable, noted the court. “They include a misogynistic society with entrenched cultural values and beliefs, bias (often sub-conscious) about the stereotypical role of women, social and political structures that are heavily male-centric.” Former additional solicitor general and senior counsel Indira Jaising told HT: “Judges of the high courts and the Supreme Court also need sensitisation. They must practice what they preach. In my opinion, a much deeper exercise of gender audit of all courts needs to be made by a committee of retired judges who have proved their commitment to gender justice.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/patriarchal-justice-won-t-do-sc-lays-down-the-law-101616099547026.html

Energy minister Bijendra Prasad Yadav, who was also in charge of the department, moved the Bihar Lokayukta (amendment) Bill, 2021, which proposes to restrict proclivity to file fabricated complaints against public servants. As per the bill, false complaints will lead to punitive action, including imprisonment up to three years and fine, against the compliant. Though many opposition leaders, including Congress legislature party leader Ajeet Sharma and RJD’s Lalit Yadav, said such harsh punishment could discourage whistle-blowers and embolden the corrupt, the amendments were rejected. “It has come to light that fictitious complaints are also being lodged before the Lokayukta, which leads to wastage of time of the institution. As there is no provision in the present Act under which action could be taken against those lodging false complaints, the amendment bill has been necessitated in keeping with such provision in the Lokayukta Act of other states,” says the bill. Another bill is the Bihar taxation disputes resolution bill, 2021, moved by Deputy CM Tarkishore Prasad, who also holds the finance portfolio. It proposes to identify ways for growth in state’s resources affected due to the pandemic. It repeals the Bihar taxation disputes resolution ordinance (second), 2020. “In view of Covid-19 pandemic, which has affected economic activities across the country, it was necessary to bring a new taxation dispute settlement (amendment) bill with some modifications, though a law in this regard was in place since 2015,” he said. The third bill is the Bihar Municipal (amendment) Bill, 2021, which provides greater autonomy to the civic bodies to ensure smooth, transparent and uniform recruitment process on created posts. It also proposes effective curb on encroachment on public roads The fourth bill is the Bihar civil courts bill, 2021. It has been brought to have a separate civil courts bill for Bihar. Earlier, Bihar was also included in the Bengal, Agra and Assam civil courts Act, 1887 enacted during the British rule. “It is a historic day for the Bihar civil courts,” said Bijendra Prasad Yadav.

An ancestral property dispute among family members has come to fore, said police.“Gangaram had been asking for a passage to get to his 1.5 acre of land through the vegetable field of his mother but she and his brother had refused. There was also an issue of the ownership of a land which was in the possession of Gangaram,” the police press note said. Gangaram had earlier threatened to kill his mother but nobody took it seriously, an official said. Police said that they formed a dozen teams to solve the case and also performed polygraph tests.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/man-arrested-for-murder-of-parents-2-other-family-members-in-chhattisgarh-101616095157013.html
19-03-2021||India||Relief for migrant workers: ‘One nation, one ration card’ expands to 32 states||The Modi government’s “one nation, one ration card” programme, a digital system aimed at enabling countrywide access to subsidized foodgrains for 80 million migrant workers, is now operational in all 32 states, while four states are in the process of digitizing their networks, data from the food ministry shows.Between August and February, there were 230 million transactions through the digitized system, the data show.The government has also rolled out “Mera Ration”, a mobile app, available to 67% of the population or over 800 million beneficiaries of subsidized grains under the National Food Security Act 2013, food secretary Sudhanshu Pandey told HT. The app will show beneficiaries real-time data of ration stocks, their share and nearest fair-price shops from where they can procure cheap grains.The one nation, one ration card system will come as a boon for migrant workers, who could not access their share of cheap foodgrains when they relocated from their native places for work in cities because the system did not allow for it.A migrant worker just needs to present his ration card, which is now seeded with the 12-digit biometric Aadhaar, in digitized ration shops to withdraw subsidised foodgrains, a lifeline for 67% of Indians deemed food-insure.The new digital network does away with the need for a migrant to make a fresh ration card, a cumbersome task, while shifting to faraway cities or another district for work to be able to withdraw grains from the public distribution system (PDS).During the peak pandemic months, the plight of thousands of workers fleeing cities, facing hunger and distress in the aftermath of the coronavirus lockdown, could have been eased had the programme to make subsidized rations portable for migrants been fully operational. The programme hadn’t gained the scale and reach to be a mitigating factor then.According to data from the ministry, West Bengal, Delhi, Chhattisgarh and Assam are yet to operationalize the system or at an advanced stage of implementing it. “The problem with Assam is that Aadhaar penetration is low. Delhi and West Bengal are almost ready with the digital infrastructure,” Pandey said.In 32 states, the scheme is now fully geared for seamless inter-state and even intra-state transactions. Inter-state portability, whereby a migrant draws subsidised food in a state other than his own, ensures in-kind subsidies move with migrants wherever they go.The Economic Survey 2016-17 used some new metrics to give updated data on migration. It suggested an annual inter-state migration flow of close to 9 million from 2011 to 2016 in a “circular” fashion based on data from railways.The first portability trials were done by September 2018 in clusters in six states. By January 2020, 12 states -- Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Gujarat, Maharasthra, Haryana, Rajasthan, Karnataka, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Goa, Jharkhand and Tripura – were in.The system essentially allowed for “state-level portability”, meaning ration-card holders could draw rations from any electronically linked fair price shops within their “district or state”.A novel cohort-based migration metric, a statistical tool developed by former chief economic adviser Arvind Subramanian, revealed an annual “inter-state migrant population of about 60 million and an inter-district migration as high as 80 million” between 2001 and 2011. Subramanian had called for full portability of all welfare doles.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-relief-for-migrant-workers-one-nation-one-ration-card-expands-to-32-states-101616094437932.html
19-03-2021||India||Hometown residents laud Tamil Nadu CM on infra, rue lack of jobs||Salem: Residents of Tamil Nadu chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami’s Siluvampalayam village fondly recall the man riding his motorcycle around town, sourcing jaggery from sugarcane farmers, and selling it at a market in near-by Erode. They say Palaniswami’s personality has not changed much and are happy over the infrastructure he has developed in the village but lament a lack of job opportunities, particularly for educated young people.Palaniswami’s constituency, Edapaddi, named after the biggest town in the region, has good roads, roundabouts shaded by bougainvillea trees, and streetlights amid rolling fields. It also has an arts and sciences college. Palaniswami inaugurated the college in 2014 and made higher education accessible particularly to women such as M Lavanya, 24.Lavanya, an MBA graduate, who belongs to the most backward fisherfolk community, completed her undergraduate and master’s courses from the college as a topper. After campus placement, she moved to Chennai’s Tata Consultancy Services, where she worked for three months before returning home to get married. She later took another job before quitting again to take care of her child. Lavanya now plans to take up a local panchayat office job for ₹4,000 a month. Her husband, a mechanical engineer by training, has been forced to work as a mason. “There is no value for our degree here,” said Lavanya.Lavanya is grateful that she went to the college, where she shifted to from a private college, 20-kilometer away. “In our village, they would not let girls study after class 12. It is only because of this college that our families are allowing us to study,” she said. “The chief minister has done a lot for us here. We see him often when he comes for our sports day or annual day.” Agriculture and textile manufacturing are the prime job-generating sectors in the area where most of the people are from the Gounder community of Palaniswami, or Vanniyars and Nadars.Residents say Palaniswami, who is contesting from Edappadi is expected to win his seat with a higher margin for the fifth time in the April 6 elections. Palaniswami, who joined the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam in 1974, was elected to the assembly earlier in 1989, 1991, 2011, and 2016.L Ilaykya, a shopkeeper, said she will vote for the opposition Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) like the rest of her family, but added that she still wants Palaniswami to be re-elected from his constituency. “Women have security financially through government schemes, farm loans, and jewellery loans waivers,” said Ilaykya, who belongs to the Nadar caste. “The road infrastructure and lights at night also offer us protection. Even the care at government hospitals is better than private facilities.” M Mani, a farmer, said he too hopes Palaniswami wins so that their village continues to develop. Mani’s brother, K Subramani, who died in 2016, was a DMK panchayat leader. “Since his death, I have been supporting him [Palaniswami],” said Mani, a Gounder. He praised Palaniswami for the farm loan waiver and redirecting surplus water from the Cauvery and added it will work to his advantage. Mani added that the DMK candidate K Sampathkumar also enjoys a good reputation, but the people are more familiar Palaniswami.P Madeshwaran, a tailor and Palaniswami supporter, said they do not require anything for free if basic amenities are met. “If farmers have enough water...there is no requirement for loan waivers,” said Madeshwaran, who farms whenever there is water. Madeshwaran, a Vanniyar, said the 10.5% reservation for the community that Palaniswami announced just before elections would help. “There are two graduates in my family who are weaving cloth along with my wife at home. With this reservation, it will help them get jobs at least in nearby places since there is no job opportunity here.”The college remains the most talked about. It has a sprawling campus with three blocks where arts, sciences, and polytechnic courses are taught to 680 women and 780 men. “The locality is backward, and this college will uplift them,” said the college principal, P Venkateshwaran. “90% of them [students] are from MBC [most backward castes] and 5% from BC [backward castes] and 5% from SC [scheduled castes]. They are the first graduates of their families. The chief minister has focussed on infrastructure and education development.”Palaniswami’s house is located in Siluvampalayam village, around 10-kilometers from Edappadi town, adjacent to that of his brother Govindaraj’s. The houses stand out among the cement-floored modest homes alongside well-laid tar roads, and plantain, and sugarcane farms.Govindaraj, a farmer, said his brother has come up through the ranks. “We always knew he will be in a high position but coming from a small village we never thought he would one day be ...the chief minister,” Govindaraj. He added they are a close-knit family with an elder sister. “Whenever he is in Salem, he comes home. We do not discuss politics...”A Thalli, a neighbour, said the chief minister’s father donated land to them when they worked for him to build a house.But Thali is unhappy. “Yes, he is the chief minister. So what? How has our life changed?” Her son, A Murugan, said he has spoken to the chief minister about the lack of jobs in the area. “He [Palaniswami] is a good man,” said Murugan. “The chief minister has done all sorts of work on the farm. When he says he understands farmers’ plight, it is true. He has a lot of support here. But the lack of jobs is leaving us frustrated.”On a farm nearby, a group of women wished the constituency had an industrial unit where they could work. “We have been working in these farms under the scorching sun for more than 40 years; all for ₹200 a day,” said Arasamani, showing her palms that have bruises and boils. “I do not have any other option. My son is physically and mentally disabled. So, I have to take care of him.”Unemployment is a key poll issue for Sampathkumar, 36, who is making his electoral debut by contesting against Palaniswami. “The chief minister and his family grew but the constituency and even his own party men have not seen growth,” said Sampathkumar. “He could have done so much more here but he only gave good roads on which he travels... I have promised that we will make job opportunities available; provide basic amenities and create a textile park for the weavers.”M Murugan, Edappadi town secretary, insisted the people are very supportive of the government’s initiatives. “It shows the support and faith they have in the chief minister.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hometown-residents-laud-tamil-nadu-cm-on-infra-rue-lack-of-jobs-101616092696318.html
19-03-2021||India||Austin urged to raise farmers’ stir, Russian S-400 deal on India visit||Washington Robert Menendez, a Democrat heading the powerful US senate committee on foreign relations, has urged defence secretary Lloyd Austin to raise during his India visit a number of issues that could be uncomfortable for his hosts, such as democratic rights and values in the context of farmer protests and arms purchases from Russia such as the S-400 systems.Austin will reach India on Friday for talks with his counterparts and other officials. His stated agenda, as previewed by the Pentagon last week, include “deepening the US-India major defence partnership and advancing cooperation between our countries for a free, prosperous and open Indo-Pacific and Western Indian Ocean Region”.The defence secretary may or may not bring up Menendez’s issues in his meetings in New Delhi, which will be the first India visit by a member of President Joe Biden’s cabinet, but the senior senator’s call for them to be raised points to tough conversations down the road.Menendez, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, urged Austin in a letter on Wednesday to raise “democracy and human rights concerns” in the context of the ongoing farmer protests and 2019 enactment of the Citizenship Amendment Act and the abrogation of Article 370.There is growing disquiet among several US lawmakers over the farmer protests and the government response to them.Invoking the Biden administration’s recently released Interim National Security Strategic Guidance, which underscores the importance of “democracy (as) essential to meeting the challenges of our time”, the senator wrote, “We should seek to partner with India to address challenges from China to climate change, but in doing so we cannot let our democratic values fall away.”Menendez also urged the defence secretary to raise US opposition to India’s planned purchase of the S-400 Russian missile defence systems, which, he wrote, “threatens future US-India defence cooperation and puts India at risk of sanctions” under the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA), a US law that aims to punish Russia for the 2016 election interference by, among other things, scaring away its defence industry clients with the threat of secondary sanctions.India paid an initial amount of $800 million for five S-400s in 2019 and is expected to receive them by the end of the year.CAATSA sanctions typically kick in when the buyer country accepts the delivery of the Russian equipment, as it happened in the case of Turkey.Turkey accepted the delivery of its first S-400s in July 2019, and the US cut it out next week from the F-35 programme to develop what are said to be the world’s most advanced fighter jets. A fuller range of sanctions was imposed by the Trump administration in December 2020.India hopes to get a waiver from CAATSA sanctions, but US officials have warned against presuming it and have also said that among other things the Russian missile defence systems could impede India’s inter-operability with American defence hardware and could imperil future arms transfers||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/austin-urged-to-raise-farmers-stir-russian-s-400-deal-on-india-visit-101616092516310.html

They then put four or five handkerchiefs in his mouth and covered his entire face with a scarf,” a police officer said on condition of anonymity.“The murderer might have used chloroform to make Hiran unconscious or might have used some other means, because Hiran’s face was covered by number of handkerchiefs and was covered by a mask. Perhaps, he was later (after becoming unconscious) thrown into the water,” the official added.The result of a test submitted by a forensic team at the JJ Hospital on Wednesday confirmed the presence of diatoms in Hiran’s body. Diatoms are single-celled algae and this test is usually conducted to detect their presence in the body to indicate drowning. The report was sent to the forensic science laboratory (FSL) in Madhuban, Haryana to seek a second opinion.Though the JJ Hospital report suggests that Hiran was alive when he was thrown into the creek, some ATS investigators have raised doubts regarding this line of inquiry.Another car seizedNIA on Thursday seized another luxury car allegedly used by suspended Mumbai police officer Sachin Vaze, PTI reported. The Toyota Land Cruiser Prado was found parked outside Vaze’s residence in Saket area of adjoining Thane, an agency official said.NIA previously seized a black Mercedes-Benz GLC 220D 4Matic from a parking area of the Azad Maidan police station, which was reportedly used by Vaze. They recovered ₹5 lakh in cash, a note-counting machine, vehicle registration plates and some clothes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bizman-hiran-s-body-had-injuries-on-head-neck-says-ats-officer-101616092396203.html
19-03-2021||India||Don’t object to Rhea bail, disagree with some HC observations: NCB to SC||The Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) on Thursday said that it did not object to the bail granted to actor Rhea Chakraborty in a drugs-related case, submitting in the Supreme Court that its objections were to certain observations made by the Bombay high court in its bail order.Arguing for an appeal against the bail order, solicitor general Tushar Mehta and additional solicitor general SV Raju appeared for the NCB.“We are not here on the grant of bail. But there are certain observations made by the high court in the order regarding the applicability of the NDPS Act that could make the law unworkable,” Mehta told a bench headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde.But the bench, which also included justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian, said the NCB could not challenge the observations made in the facts of that case. “You cannot file a petition challenging the observations. You can only challenge the order. The observations are prima facie. The observations are made in the facts of the case,” the bench said.The comments from the court prompted Mehta to seek permission to amend the NCB’s petition. “Let this matter be heard next week. We will amend the petition and challenge the high court order,” he said. The bench then adjourned the matter.Rhea, arrested in a case linked to the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput, was granted bail by the Bombay high court on October 7 last year. Dismissing the NCB’s allegations that she financed or supported drug trafficking, the HC said, “She is not part of drug dealers.” There was no evidence to show she forwarded the drugs allegedly procured by her to somebody else to earn monetary or other benefits, the court added.Rajput, 34, was found dead at his flat in Mumbai on June 14 last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dont-object-to-rhea-bail-disagree-with-some-hc-observations-ncb-to-sc-101616092216801.html
19-03-2021||India||India to analyse age-specific death rates in vaccinated people||The national Adverse Events Following Immunisation (AEFI) committee has taken up an exercise to compare age-specific death rates in the inoculated population with the estimated death rate in the same population group that was not immunised against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), people aware of the matter said on Thursday.The World Health Organization (WHO) defines AEFI as any untoward medical event that follows vaccination and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the usage of the vaccine.The AEFI analysis will be being done in the age groups of 20-40, 40-50, 50-60, and 60 years and above.“This is a massive exercise that was started today (Thursday) morning to put people’s minds at ease regarding Covid-19 vaccines. Even though no deaths post vaccinations have been causally linked to vaccines in our review, we are trying to analyse deaths in people who were given Covid-19 vaccination differently. The data is being analysed to know if there are more deaths taking place in the population group that’s given vaccine than in the same age group that’s not given vaccine but die due to other reasons,” said a senior member of the committee, requesting not to be identified.The central government began a review of AEFI data from across the country last week after some countries in the European Union temporarily suspended the use of the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine as a precautionary measure based on reports of rare blood clotting events in people receiving the vaccine.“This is being done to overcome any vaccine hesitancy among the masses,” said Dr NK Arora, member, National Covid Task Force, and national AEFI committee.In India, the Serum Institute of India (SII) is manufacturing the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine as Covishield, one of the two vaccines approved for use. Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin, which it has co-developed with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), is the other vaccine approved for use.India launched the Covid-19 vaccination drive on January 16, 2021, and since then, the country has administered at least 36 million vaccine doses.As India immunises a large number of children annually under its national immunisation programme, there is a dedicated AEFI secretariat functional in the country which looks at vaccine-related adverse events.“Only a few countries in the world have this kind of secretariat with a specialised task force; so we will be making use of these technical experts to do the required analysis. If the death rate is more than it should be, it is a cause for concern but if it is the same or lower, then people will understand that it is not Covid-19 vaccines that are causing deaths. This is being done purely for the ease and comfort of people,” the first person quoted above said.The experts will collect all cause mortality data of different age groups from 2018-19 before the Covid-19 pandemic hit the country for comparison with mortality data in the vaccinated group.The results are expected to be out in a few days. Prima facie review of 71 deaths in people having received Covid-19 vaccines does not link any of the deaths to the shots.Public health experts are of the opinion that this exercise would help in building vaccine confidence.“It will be good to have this kind of data at the population level,” said Dr K Srinath Reddy, founder, Public Health Foundation of India.WHO, in its latest statement, has recommended that vaccinations should continue. “WHO is in regular contact with the European Medicines Agency and regulators around the world for the latest information on COVID-19 vaccine safety. The WHO COVID-19 Subcommittee of the Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety is carefully assessing the latest available safety data for the AstraZeneca vaccine. Once that review is completed, WHO will immediately communicate the findings to the public. At this time, WHO considers that the benefits of the AstraZeneca vaccine outweigh its risks and recommends that vaccinations continue,” the WHO statement read.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-to-analyse-age-specific-death-rates-in-vaccinated-people-101616092098400.html

Maha logs highest single-day cases||Maharashtra on Thursday recorded 25,833 new Covid-19 cases while the state capital, Mumbai logged 2,877 new infections, the highest one-day spike ever since the outbreak of the virus in March last year. The previous highest in Maharashtra was 24,886 in September 11 last year while in Mumbai, the previous highest was 2,848 cases on October 7 last year.Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray informed that the Center has given a green signal to 134 private hospitals to start vaccination in their premises and asked the authorities to chalk out a plan to vaccinate 3 lakh people daily.Dr Tatyarao Lahane, director, Directorate of Medical Education and Research (DMER) said though it is the peak, one more week is needed to assess the situation.“We need to assess whether the figures come down or go upwards from here. This will require at least a week time. We have,however, managed to reduce the number of deaths from the peak of 350 to 60. Even this needs to be curtailed further,” said Lahane.He said that the cases have also increased due to the increase in the number of daily testing.The government has scaled up testing as was evident as 1,21,335 people were tested in the last 24 hours and 119, 973 before that.The total number of deaths in Maharashtra has now reached to a total of 53,138.Dr Ameet Mandot, who runs the Gut Clinic at Parel, blamed both the citizens as well as authorities for this peak.“The citizens have become very casual and there is no seriousness shown by them in adhering to Covid-19 norms. In addition, the authorities are failing to enforce rules as we are witnessing crowded marriage halls, functions sans social distancing and revellers in pubs dancing away without any masks. There seems to be no effort by the authorities to curb this,” said Mandot.Thackeray in his review meeting on Thursday to assess the Covid-19 spread asked the doctors to keep a watch on the various strains of Covid-19 virus and guide the government in suggesting ways to bring the situation under control.He also ordered the authorities to complete the vaccinations of the priority group within the next three four months.Out of the total 1,66,353 active cases in the state, Pune continues to lead the state with 35,539 active cases followed by Nagpur with 24,209 active cases, Mumbai and Thane take the third and fourth position with 17,153 and 15,548 active cases respectively||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bigger-than-1st-wave-maha-logs-highest-single-day-cases-101616091496782.html

He added that the government welcomes dissent on social media, which has nearly 1.4 billion users in India.“The issue is not the use of social media, it is the abuse of social media,” he said. “Any attempt to create imperialism of the internet by a few companies is not acceptable.”The new guidelines have been welcomed by industry body IAMAI, but critics have said it may lead to over regulation of content. Large social media companies such as Facebook and Twitter are yet to officially comment on the rules. The guidelines cover social media intermediaries such as WhatsApp, Facebook and Twitter. They also cover digital new media outfits and over the top content providers, such as Netflix and Hotstar.The government notified three-tier self-regulatory guidelines on February 26. Intermediaries have within 30 to 90 days to comply with the same. Significant social media intermediaries, who have over five million users, have to appoint a compliance officer. At the apex of the grievance redress system is an interministerial committee that will be headed by an official from the ministry of information and broadcasting.“The guidelines are very clear when it comes content that has to be taken down,” Prasad said. “It is 36 hours, when it comes to content regarding the unity, safety and security of India. We have added the dignity of women.”The 36-hour timeline already exists under Section 69(A) of the Information Technology Act, which grants the government power to take emergency action against such content. The minister drew the attention of the House to a debate in 2018, wherein Parliament debated issues revolving around fake news and safety of women. “A commitment was taken from me as the minister to strengthen the provisions around the same,” Prasad said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/content-offending-women-s-dignity-to-be-removed-in-24-hrs-prasad-101616091496186.html

19-03-2021||India||The inside story of why Indira Gandhi called the 1977 elections||During his video interaction with Congress party leader Rahul Gandhi on March 2, 2021, Kaushik Basu, former chief economist of the World Bank and currently professor of International Studies and Economics at Cornell University, described his conversation with former President Pranab Mukherjee about Prime Minister Indira Gandhi calling for elections in January 1977.Basu recounted: “I asked Pranab Mukherjee whether it was hubris, the arrogance of an authoritarian leader that she would win? Or was it that she was beginning to have self doubts?” Basu added that Mukherjee told him: “Actually I have direct conversational evidence. She began to think she would lose. But she wanted to put it to the test and have a fair election, even if she would lose. Having made a huge mistake, she wanted to rectify that and bring back democracy”.Almost all the popularly believed notions about why Indira Gandhi unexpectedly called for elections are incorrect.In the second week of November 1976 itself, she told her principal secretary Professor PN Dhar and my father, HY Sharada Prasad, who was her information advisor: “I am going to end the Emergency and call for elections. I know that I will lose, but this is something which I absolutely need to do”.Also Read | Congress built sub-standard buildings: Puri on Central Vista criticismBut till she made her announcement on All India Radio on January 18, 1977, she took great care to ensure that no one in the Congress had the slightest inkling at all. She was especially careful that her son Sanjay Gandhi was kept in the dark; he came to know only from her radio broadcast, and he had an angry showdown with her.It is commonly believed that Indira Gandhi called for elections because the Intelligence Bureau told her that she would win 330 seats. However, she had told PN Dhar and my father in mid-November 1976: “The intelligence agencies will tell me what they think I want to hear. But I know that I am going to lose, even though the IB is telling me that I will win 330 seats. However, it is absolutely necessary for me to call for elections.”A couple of weeks earlier, Michael MacKintosh Foot, who was then United Kingdom’s Lord President of the Council and Leader of the House of Commons, obliquely hintedto my father that Indira Gandhi would call for elections even though she knew she would lose. Foot, who regarded himself as being Indira Gandhi’s elder brother, and who had the courage to speak frankly with her, spent several days in India in October 1976. He told her to release political prisoners, end press censorship, and he told her several harsh truths about Sanjay Gandhi’s sterilisation programs.She heard Foot patiently, but made no commitments about ending the Emergency. Instead she elaborated on the reasons why she was compelled to declare the Emergency, strongly defended the family planning programme, and firmly told Foot that his good friend, George Fernandes, would have to stand trial on terrorism and treason charges. Foot then spent several hours emphasising Jawaharlal Nehru’s ideals.In spite of being rebuffed by someone with whom he shared a close sibling-like relationship, Foot wrote to my father soon after he returned to UK: “...Crosland (CAR Crosland was UK’s Foreign Secretary) told me that Indira would never call another democratic election, when I was certain that she would do exactly that even if her own hopes of winning were to be confounded…”On February 2, 1977, when Jagjivan Ram and Hemavati Nandan Bahuguna defected, she told my father: “It is all over now. I am sure to lose the elections”. She had a grudging admiration for the wily Bahuguna’s uncanny ability to anticipate changing political trends and always place himself on the winning side. She told my father, “Now that Bahuguna has abandoned me, I will be wiped out in Uttar Pradesh”. And she cryptically added: “It will be a relief if I lose, an absolute relief”.But even then, she did not lose her sense of humour. The day Jagjivan Ram defected was also the day that the Indian cricket team won a consolation test match against Tony Greig’s visiting MCC team, having already lost the test series. She remarked: “As usual, the Indian press has no news sense. The correct priority of the headlines should be—India wins test, Jagjivan Ram defects.”Further, on February 13-14 1977, Indira Gandhi told her good friend, US Senator Charles Percy, that she would lose the elections badly, and that she was worried about her son Sanjay Gandhi.After March 1977, several people tried to take credit for Indira Gandhi’s ending the Emergency. But their claims are not credible.Her friend, the cultural czarina Pupul Jayakar, claimed that her guru, the philosopher Jiddu Krishnamurthi, was responsible, because Indira Gandhi had told Krishnamurthi on October 28, 1976 : “I am riding on the back of a tiger. I do not mind the tiger killing me. But I do not know how to get off its back”. Jiddu Krishnamurthi replied to Indira Gandhi that if she thought deeply enough about her situation, she herself would obtain the answer. Jayakar claims that it was this exchange with Jiddu Krishnamurthi which persuaded Indira Gandhi to “end the Emergency, no matter what the consequences would be for her.” Attributing a cause-and-effect to this vague generalised response of Krishnamurthi seems far fetched.The followers of the Shankaracharya of Kanchi, especially Subramanian Swamy, too claimed after March 1977 that his refusal to speak to her was instrumental in Indira Gandhi’s ending the Emergency. This is inaccurate. She had very high regard for the Kanchi Shankaracharya. The day she called on him, he was observing a vow of silence. My father had accompanied her. She and the Shankaracharya sat opposite each other, communing in total silence for three hours. As they departed from Kanchi, Indira Gandhi told my father: “I am at peace now. I put all my questions to him, and received the answers I wanted. I am now clear about what I should do”. Indira Gandhi added to my father: “Does one need mere words to communicate?” There was no question at all of the Kanchi Shankaracharya snubbing her; rather they had a deep telepathic communication in total silence.Neither PN Dhar nor my father disclosed the reasons why Indira Gandhi called for elections, and it is not clear if they came to know of her reasons at all. PN Dhar stated later: “Was her decision to hold elections a calculated risk—or was it something else? There may never be a conclusive answer. I believe she was not comfortable with the Emergency, and wanted desperately to get out of it, somehow, anyhow”.To me, it could be that Indira Gandhi lifted the Emergency because she was more the daughter of Jawaharlal Nehru than she was the mother of Sanjay Gandhi.Ravi Visvesvaraya Sharada Prasad, an alumnus of Carnegie Mellon and Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur, is a technology consultant and defence analyst.

19-03-2021||India||Haryana passes recovery of damage to property Bill amid Opposition protest||Amid loud protests by the opposition, the Haryana assembly on Thursday passed the Haryana Recovery of Damages to Property During Disturbance of Public Order Bill. The Bill provides for recovery of damages to properties caused by persons during agitations, including riots and violent disorder.It also provides for constitution of a claims tribunal to determine the liability, assess the damage and award compensation.Even as Speaker Gian Chand Gupta went through the process to pass the Bill by a voice vote in the assembly, the Congress MLAs assembled in the well of the House, raising slogans, waving copies and seeking the withdrawal of the Bill.Earlier, home minister Anil Vij, who introduced the Bill, tried to allay speculation that it was being brought in view of the ongoing farmers’ protest. “People protest peacefully. But what if someone damages public property?” he said.Bid to suppress farmers’ protest: Cong When Congress MLA Raghuvir Singh Kadian said this bill raised suspicion about its necessity and the intent of the government. “It is something similar to the three central farm laws and it has been brought in such a situation that it raises suspicion. The word instigator used in the Bill strengthens our view that it is a vindictive piece of legislation in the offing. Withhold this Bill and refer it to a select committee,” he said.Leader of opposition Bhupinder Singh Hooda said that the Bill talks about “deterrence in the minds of people”. “This is being done to scare people from protesting. Peaceful protest is every citizen’s right. There are already legal provisions pertaining to damage caused to property. What about the responsibility of the police in not being able to control law and order?” Hooda said.Congress MLA Kiran Choudhry said the perception is that this law is being brought to suppress the farmers’ agitation. “The government first brought a resolution to condemn those who boycott them and now this Bill has been tabled. This is a draconian law having sweeping powers to frame innocent people,” she said.Vij, however, said all such theories were the products of the minds of Congress MLAs. “The enactment of this law was on our mind well before the farmers’ protest. Should we allow people’s homes to burn? Are you with the rioters or against them? This Bill has been brought on public demand,” he said.Hooda, however, replied that they support the farmers and peaceful protesters. “Why cases have been registered against farmers when the home minister himself said they haven’t done anything? Please withdraw this Bill,” he said.Ensures fixing of civil liability: CM Chief minister ML Khattar said protecting property is the duty of the state government. “We will continue to do it?” he said. The chief minister clarified that the existing provision in the Indian Penal Code pertained to fixing criminal liability but this law only ensures fixing of civil liability.Independent MLA Sombir Sangwan said the IPC already provided for punishment for rioting and damaging public property. “This law is not required enacted, and it will be misused. Remember, the farmers’ agitation will not end by this law,” Sangwan said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/haryana-passes-recovery-of-damage-to-public-property-bill-amid-oppn-protest-101616064916676.html
19-03-2021||India||Government announces details of vehicle scrappage policy||Union minister for road transport and highways Nitin Gadkari on Thursday announced the details for the country’s long-awaited vehicle scrapping policy in Parliament, explaining that the absence of a fitness certificate will mean an automatic cancellation of registration for commercial vehicles that turn 15, and that the registration of a private vehicle will be for 20 years, with renewal requiring proof of fitness. The minister added that the government plans to incentivise owners of old vehicles to scrap these through registered scrap centres.The policy, which also recommends the mandatory scrapping of all government vehicles over 15 years old, applies only to four-wheeled vehicles.India has 17 lakh medium and heavy commercial vehicles that are older than 15 years without any valid fitness certificate, 51 lakh light motor vehicles older than 20 years and 34 lakh light motor vehicles older than 15 years, according to the transport ministry. The average age of commercial vehicles is over 10 years and the private ones, 10-15 years.The move is expected to reduce pollution, create job opportunities, through the registered scrapping centres, and boost demand for new vehicles.“It is proposed that commercial vehicles be deregistered after 15 years in case of failure to get the fitness certificate. As a disincentive measure, increased fees for fitness certificate and fitness test may be applicable for commercial vehicles 15 year onwards from the date of initial registration,” Gadkari said in Lok Sabha.“It is proposed that private vehicles be deregistered after 20 years if found unfit or in case of a failure to renew registration certificate. As a disincentive measure, increased re-registration fees will be applicable for private vehicles 15 years onwards from the date of initial registration,” he added.“It is being proposed that all vehicles of the Central Government, State Government, Municipal Corporation, Panchayats, State Transport Undertakings, Public Sector Undertakings and autonomous bodies with the Union and State Governments may be de-registered and scrapped after 15 years from the date of registration,” Gadkari said.“Indian automobile industry has already upgraded to one of the most advanced emission standards. While new vehicles will be least polluting, vehicles which are old creates enormous pollution with least safety standards will now be eligible for scrappage thus making roads safer and air cleaner. The guidelines and advice announced today are in the right direction and now, the State Governments and OEMs have to do their part to make it a success. Scrappage value of vehicle in range of 4-6% of the ex-showroom price, rebate of upto 25% for PV and 15% for CV by State Governments on Road Tax, 5% discount from OEM’s on new vehicle and registration fee being waived off will definitely help to excite the customer and motivate him to scrap his old vehicle. It will also revive the ailing CV segment and in turn will boost State exchequer’s revenue on sale of new vehicles,” said Federation of Automobile Dealers Associations (FADA) president Vinkesh Gulati.“We welcome the announcement made by Ministry of Transport and it’s a good mix of both - incentives for those who opt to scrap their old vehicles and an additional burden for those who would like to continue with their old vehicles. This fine balance should help in driving old vehicles out of road leading to reduction in pollution levels and driving demand for new vehicles across all the segments. This announcement will also lead to creation for more scrapyards in the country and effective recovery of waste from old vehicles” said Rajeev Singh, Partner and Automotive Leader, Deloitte India.India’s long-pending voluntary vehicle scrapping policy for phasing out of old vehicles considered to be more polluting has been in the works since 2016, but was announced by Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman in the Union Budget for 2021-22. The policy of scrapping old, polluting and fuel-guzzling vehicles is an attempt to reduce pollution and road congestion . It was sent to the Cabinet Secretariat to be put up before the cabinet for its approval in February 2020.The transport ministry will, in the next few weeks, publish draft notifications and seek public comments within a period of 30 days, the ministry said.Gadkari said that the scrapping policy will lead to new investment of around Rs10,000 crore and create 35,000 jobs. The minister said the policy will cover an estimated 5.1 million light motor vehicles (LMV; mostly cars) that are above 20 years of age, while another 3.4 million LMVs are above 15 years. It will also cover 1.7 million medium and heavy motor vehicles (trucks, buses, commercial vans), that are above 15 years, and currently without valid fitness certificates.“The scheme shall provide strong incentives to owners of old vehicles to scrap old and unfit vehicles through registered scrapping centres, which shall provide the owners with a scrapping certificate,” Gadkari said.Some of the incentives are: scrap value for the old vehicle given by the scrapping centre, expected to be 4-6% of the price of a new vehicle; a potential road- tax rebate of up to 25% for new personal vehicles and up to 15% for new commercial vehicles from the states; and a potential discount of 5% offered by auto companies against the scrapping certificate, the policy said.At a press briefing later on Thursday, Gadkari said he has requested the Union finance minister and states to give concession in the Goods & Services Tax on the purchase of new vehicles for those scrapping older vehicles. He also said that vintage cars will be kept out of the scrapping policy.The policy also states that registration fees may also be waived for purchase of new vehicle against the scrapping certificate.“The Ministry of Road Transport and Highways will promote setting up of Registered Vehicle Scrapping Facilities (RVSFs) across India and will encourage public and private participation for opening up of such centres. Efforts are also being made to set up integrated scrapping facilities across India. Some of the identified places include Alang in Gujarat, where it is being planned to develop a highly specialized centre for scrapping among many other potential centres, where different scrapping technologies can be synergised ,” Gadkari said.Alang is a global centre for ship breaking.The minister also said Centre will promote the creation of Automated Fitness Centres on a Public Private Partnership model by state government, the private sector and automobile companies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-to-provide-tax-incentives-against-vehicle-scrappage-gadkari-101616057294684.html
19-03-2021||India||Delhi high court seeks Centre's stand on plea against new WhatsApp privacy policy||The Delhi high court on Wednesday issued notice to Centre and Facebook-owned WhatsApp Inc on a plea seeking direction to provide with an option to opt out of sharing their personal data with Facebook. The petition is against the new policy announced by WhatsApp which mandates sharing of personal data.The notice was issued by a bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh. The high court has sought to know Centre's stand on the issue by March.The petitioners, Seema Singh and Meghan, have contended that the new privacy policy indicates the "fissures" in Indian data protection and privacy laws.Also Read: Delhi HC says ‘not mandatory to download WhatsApp on mobile’The new privacy policy was announced by WhatsApp on January 4. It includes mandatory sharing of data with the parent company. The decision to share data was first floated in 2016, post WhatsApp’s acquisition by Facebook, but until last week, users already on the platform before the acquisition had the choice of not sharing that data. That choice no longer exists.The move has faced massive backlash globally - especially in WhatsApp’s biggest market India where it has 400 million users - with a surge being reported in other messaging applications such as Signal and Telegram.Faced with user protests, WhatsApp started posting status messages in India about its commitment towards maintaining privacy of its users. The company said that the backlash is due to misperceptions about the upcoming changes to its privacy policy.The status messages read "One thing that isn't new is our commitment to your privacy," along with a reminder that "WhatsApp can't read or listen to your personal conversations as they're end-to-end encrypted."A plea has also been filed in the Supreme Court seeking guidelines to safeguard the personal data and privacy of Indian WhatsApp users.The plea stated that the 2021 Policy of WhatsApp is highly invasive and has been unilaterally forced upon Indian internet users. It requested the top court to direct WhatsApp to provide the same standard of privacy protections to its Indian users as it is providing to users in the European Region.WhatsApp has, meanwhile, moved back the implementation of its updated privacy policy till May.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-hc-seeks-centre-s-stand-on-plea-against-new-whatsapp-privacy-policy-101612335489001.html
