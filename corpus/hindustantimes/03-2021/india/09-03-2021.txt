The BJP usually names its sitting chief minister as the candidate (something that hasn’t happened only once in recent years), but it hasn’t done so in the case of Sarbananda Sonowal. And all indications are that it is an open field. On Monday, senior party leader Himanta Biswa Sarma, considered a candidate for the top post by some, said the chief minister will be picked by the legislators. On Sunday, state BJP president Ranjeet Kumar Dass said the decision would be taken by the BJP parliamentary board after the election.“ We announce a CM candidate in states where we are not in power, but in those where we are in government, we don’t do that. We will abide by whatever decision the party takes on this,” Dass said. Interestingly, the BJP usually does not announce candidates in states where it is not in power. The BJP announced Manohar Lal Khattar and Devendra Fadavanis as chief ministerial candidates in Haryana and Maharashtra, respectively, for the assembly polls in November-December 2019 (both were sitting chief ministers). In 2018, it announced incumbent Vasundhara Raje as its CM candidate for Rajasthan.Only in the case of Jharkhand in XXXX, did it not announce incumbent Raghbar Das as its chief ministerial candidate. On Friday, when the BJP’s first list of 70 candidates was announced in New Delhi, national general secretary Arun Singh too said a decision on the chief ministerial candidate would be taken by the party’s parliamentary board after the election. The BJP, which came to power in Assam for the first time in 2016, is contesting the polls in alliance with old ally Asom Gana Parishad (AGP), which is contesting 26 seats, and new ally United Peoples Party Liberal (UPPL), which will put up candidates in eight constituencies.Sarma had earlier declared that he was not interested in contesting the assembly polls and had intimated his decision to the party leadership. As a caveat, he added that any decision on him contesting would be taken by the party and he would abide by it. When the candidates were announced, his name was on the list, as was Sonowal’s. While Sonowal would be contesting again from Majuli , Sarma will continue with his home constituency of Jalukbari. There is buzz that if Sonowal continues as chief minister for another term, Sarma could be given a place in the Narendra Modi-led government at the Centre, or that if Sarma is given charge, Sonowal could head to Delhi. Meanwhile, the Congress-led grand alliance which comprises the All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF), the Bodoland Peoples’ Front (BPF), three Left parties and a newly formed regional party has also decided not to put forward the name of a chief ministerial candidate. Party leaders said there is no unanimity within the Congress, leave alone the larger alliance on a candidate. “Having a CM face is not the issue. We are fighting together to defeat the BJP and provide good governance,” said a senior Congress leader who asked not to be named. The party’s posters feature photographs of Gaurav Gogoi, Sushmita Dev, leader of the opposition in the state assembly, Debabrata Saikia and state Congress chief Ripum Bora , to project a united front.The regional alliance of the Raijor Dal and the Assam Jatiya Parishad, formed last year as an outcome of the violent anti-Citizenship Amendment Act protests in December 2019, have also refrained from naming a CM candidate. While the AJP is headed by Lurinjyoti Gogoi, jailed activist Akhil Gogoi is president of the Raijor Dal.Polling in Assam will be held in three phases on March 27, April 1 and April 6. Filing of nominations for the first phase on March 27 started on Monday. “There is a tussle between Sonowal and Sarma for the CM’s post and the BJP doesn’t want to risk its election campaign by projecting one or the other as the face for the top post at present. Though the party is quiet on this tug of war between both leaders, it is clearly becoming clear that Sarma is increasingly being projected as someone who can lead the campaign as well as take charge after polls, if required,” said Akhil Ranjan Dutta, political columnist and professor of political science at Gauhati University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cm-files-nomination-from-majuli-seat-for-1st-phase-of-assam-polls-101615314083527.html
09-03-2021||India||ED raids Punjab MLA, 8 others over ‘links with drug syndicate’||New Delhi/Chandigarh The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Tuesday raided premises belonging to Punjab lawmaker Sukhpal Singh Khaira and his son-in-law Inderveer Singh Johal along with seven others for allegedly being part of an international drug smuggling syndicate having links in Pakistan and the UK as well as a human trafficking racket, agency officials familiar with the development said. The central agency registered two cases a few weeks back to investigate money laundering, the first on the basis of a transborder drug smuggling network unearthed in Fazilka, Punjab, in 2015, in which 1,800g heroin, 24 gold biscuits, two weapons, 26 live cartridges and two Pakistani SIM cards were seized by police; and the second pertaining to a fake passport racket being run in Delhi. Nine smugglers were sentenced in the Fazilka case in October 2017, including Gurdev Singh, Manjit Singh, Harbans Singh and Subhash Chander, raided by the ED on Tuesday.Khaira, who was present at his Sector 5 bungalow in Chandigarh during the ED raid, denied any wrongdoing. “Those who speak against the government are often targeted by them. It has not happened for the first time. My father and I have been fighting injustice throughout our lives and my crusade continues,” said Khaira, adding that those supporting the farmers’ protest and speaking against the central government were being targeted by the Centre. “There is no question of any money laundering. In fact, I am under debt. I have taken an agriculture loan of ₹2 crore, for which I am paying ₹22 lakh as annual interest,” he said.Khaira was elected to the state assembly in 2017 on an Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) ticket but later quit the party and launched his own political outfit. Khaira’s name cropped up in the case in 2017. Although not named in the Punjab police charge sheet, Khaira was issued summons by a Fazilka court on November 30, 2017. He was Punjab’s leader of the opposition as an AAP legislator at that time. However, the Supreme Court granted him relief by quashing the proceedings against him. An ED official, requesting anonymity, said: “Sukhpal Singh Khaira was actively aiding and supporting the gang of international smugglers and enjoying the proceeds of crime”. The lawmaker is likely to be called for questioning at the agency’s Delhi office. After the raids, Punjab MLAs cutting across party lines raised the issue in the state assembly and described the move as “political intimidation” by the Centre.Rebel Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) MLA Parminder Singh Dhindsa accused the Centre of using the ED as its “tool against those who speak against it”. Punjab minister Charanjit Singh Channi termed the action as completely wrong and sought a House resolution to condemn it.Rebel AAP MLA Kanwar Sandhu dubbed the raid as “unfortunate” and said it amounted to interference in the functioning of the House as raids were conducted without taking the Speaker and the state government into confidence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ed-raids-punjab-mla-8-others-over-links-with-drug-syndicate-101615313964075.html
09-03-2021||India||Rajasthan, Centre at odds over supply of Covid-19 vaccine||Jaipur: The Union health ministry on Tuesday said Rajasthan has enough Covid-19 vaccines to continue its vaccination drive hours after the state’s health minister said it has vaccines only for two more days. On Monday, the state health department is believed to have written to the Union health ministry on the same. Rajasthan, which is vaccinating 2.5 lakh people per day, currently is left with only two days of stock, said state health minister Raghu Sharma. Sharma on Tuesday said that the Centre has given the state around 3 million vaccine doses till now and estimated that around 6.7 million people will need to be vaccinated in Phase 2. “We have the vaccine for two days, if we don’t get vaccines, the drive will stop mid-way,” he said. Meanwhile, the Union health ministry clarified that there is no shortage of Covid-19 vaccines in Rajasthan“There have been some news reports suggesting impending shortage of Covid-19 vaccine doses in Rajasthan. The factual position is that there is no shortage of Covid-19 vaccine with the state at present. Rajasthan has been supplied 3.761 million doses and has consumed only 2.428 million doses till yesterday night,” the ministry said in an official release. Sharma said that the state originally received 3 million doses, of which it has used around 2.4 million with around a lakh being wasted. The state has around 5 lakh doses, enough for two more days, he added.He admitted that the state received 85,000 more doses on Tuesday and expects to receive around 670000 doses on Wednesday (that will take the number up to the 3.761 million in the Union ministry’s statement). To be sure, all vaccine sourcing is being managed by the Centre, and doses are sent in tranches to the states. Sharma pointed out that frontline and health care workers vaccinated in Phase 1 will now need second doses and recommended that the “Centre provide the state with buffer stock. We have cold chains and the required infrastructure.” He added that the state is “performing well in vaccination but need vaccines to continue with the momentum”. “I have spoken union minister Harsh Vardhan and apprised him of the situation. He has assured me that he will look into it,” said the health minister.The state has requested the Centre for the supply of 6 million additional Covid-19 vaccines. The Union health ministry added in its statement that it is closely monitoring the Covid-19 vaccine supply of all states and union territories (UTs). The central government has been providing vaccine doses to all the states and UTs as per their requirement and consumption pattern, the ministry added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajasthan-centre-at-odds-over-supply-of-covid-19-vaccine-101615313724024.html
09-03-2021||India||Quad leaders to hold first summit on March 12||New Delhi With leaders of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue set to hold their first summit on March 12, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Japanese counterpart Yoshihide Suga on Tuesday pledged to bolster cooperation with Australia and the US to tackle common challenges and ensure a free and open Indo-Pacific. The first virtual summit of the leaders of India, Australia, Japan and the US was announced by the external affairs ministry late on Tuesday night. It will be held about a year-and-half after the Quad was upgraded to the level of foreign ministers in September 2019, and reflects the desire of the group to present a united front to key challenges, including China’s belligerence across the region. Prime Minister Narendra Modi will participate with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga and US President Joe Biden in the “first Leaders’ Summit of the Quadrilateral Framework, being held virtually”, the ministry said in a statement. Besides discussing regional and global issues of shared interest, the leaders will “exchange views on practical areas of cooperation towards maintaining a free, open and inclusive Indo-Pacific”. The Quad Summit will be an opportunity to exchange views on “contemporary challenges such as resilient supply chains, emerging and critical technologies, maritime security, and climate change”, the statement added. The leaders will also review efforts to combat the Covid-19 pandemic and “explore opportunities for collaboration in ensuring safe, equitable and affordable vaccines in the Indo-Pacific region”, the statement said without giving details. Reports have suggested that the other members of Quad could invest in India’s vaccine production capabilities to expand the delivery of doses across the region, especially to counter China’s vaccine diplomacy. India is the world’s largest producer of vaccines and has supplied almost 58 million doses to 65 countries, including 7.7 million doses provided as grants. China has pledged to provide more than 460 million doses of its own vaccines to nations across the world but is yet to ramp up actual supplies. Ahead of the Quad Summit, Modi and Suga had a 40-minute phone conversation and agreed to bolster cooperation both bilaterally and through the four-nation group to ensure a free and open Indo-Pacific. The two prime ministers also discussed defence and security cooperation and Suga expressed serious concerns about China’s actions in the area ranging from Hong Kong to East China Sea. Modi and Suga agreed the India-Japan partnership can play a “pivotal role in addressing common challenges”, and emphasised that “their engagement with like-minded countries such as Australia and the US in the form of Quad consultations holds value and agreed that these useful discussions must continue”, the external affairs ministry said. A readout from Japan’s foreign ministry said the two leaders “shared the recognition that cooperation towards realising a Free and Open Indo-Pacific is becoming increasingly important and to this end, shared the view to steadily advance both Japan-India bilateral cooperation and Japan-Australia-India-US quadrilateral cooperation”. Suga expressed “serious concerns regarding unilateral attempts to change the status quo in the East and South China Sea, China’s Coast Guard Law and the situation in Hong Kong and the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region”, the Japanese readout said. While exchanging views on the region, the two leaders “confirmed that they have grave concerns over the situation in Myanmar and they would closely work together in this vein”, the readout added. Suga also sought “understanding and cooperation toward the early resolution” of the issue of Japanese citizens abducted by North Korea. The two leaders welcomed progress on the high-speed rail project in Maharashtra and the signing of a memorandum of cooperation for specified skilled Indian workers to be employed in Japan. They also agreed to celebrate the 70th anniversary of diplomatic relations between India and Japan in 2022, and Modi invited Suga to visit India at the earliest for the annual bilateral summit. The US has taken the lead in organising both the Quad summit and the third meeting of the foreign ministers of the group on February 18, against the backdrop of continuing concerns over China’s actions. During their meeting, the foreign ministers reiterated the Quad’s commitment to a rules-based world order underpinned by respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty. The Quad, formed in 2007, was revived in 2017 as a gathering of senior officials. It was upgraded to the ministerial level in 2019, reflecting the desire of the four countries to work more closely on shared interests in the Indo-Pacific and India’s growing comfort with the group.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/quad-leaders-to-hold-first-summit-on-march-12-101615313603461.html

The country started its vaccination drive from January 16 with priority given to all healthcare and frontline workers in the first phase. The second phase started from March 1 where doses are being administered to people above the age of 60 and those between 45 and 59 years with specific comorbidities.Earlier in the day, Dr PK Mishra, the principal secretary to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, chaired a high-level meeting to review the status and progress of the vaccination drives across all states and Union Territories (UTs) in which the states and UTs were asked to take the drive a notch higher by going all out in increasing registration, administration of doses etc.The meeting was attended by the chief secretaries and the officers involved in the vaccination effort in states and UTs, secretaries to the Centre from ministries/ department of health, pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, health research, Member (Health), NITI Aayog and the chief executive officer (CEO) of the National Health Authority (NHA), the release added.Mishra lauded all the government officials at the central and state level for playing an important role in the successful rollout of the vaccination drive in India — which is the largest in the world but also pointed out that this progress had to be continued in a sustained manner. The chief secretaries of states and UTs along with senior officials gave details about the progress of vaccinating beneficiaries in their respective regions. During the meeting, cabinet secretary Rajiv Gauba advised states to ramp up the pace of vaccination and cover as many beneficiaries as possible in a short duration due to the country’s large population. He further told them to prepare a plan for the coming three months to achieve the same.As the total doses administered are nearing 2.5 crore, here are the seven instructions that the Centre gave to states and UTs during the meeting:> States and UTs were asked to expand the capacity of their vaccination drive for both public and private sector, by on-boarding and operationalising as many health facilities and vaccination centres as possible.> The Centre said that equitable and easy access for Covid-19 vaccines should be given all across the country- states, districts, towns and villages and especially towards identifying existing geographical dark-zones through geospatial analysis.> States and UTs should ensure that maximum vaccination centres are operating on a daily basis. Capacity utilisation should be enhanced in these centres and wastage should be minimised.> The Centre asked states and UTs to open vaccination session for registration on the Co-Win app for at least four weeks in advance. States and UTs were also asked to optimise centre-level planning with appropriate provisions made for crowd management, drinking water and other facilities for citizens. “Ensuring real-time authentication and certification as much as possible for the convenience of the citizen as well as a check against misuse,” the Centre added.> The Centre said that registrations should be encouraged for vaccination over ‘walk-in’ mode and the entire process of facilitating it should be made convenient for all citizens. Authorities should also be given a ‘forward’ view with regard to expected demand so that they can plan properly and further avoid the overcrowding of beneficiaries.> “Optimising the supply chain down to the vaccination centre through efficient and equitable distribution while preventing any stock-piling or hoarding, with the assurance of there being no shortage of vaccine doses in the future,” the Centre said.> The Centre pointed out that the progress of the drive to administer vaccine doses to beneficiaries should be reviewed on a real-time basis till the district and block level and leveraging the end-to-end data integration of the Co-WIN app to ensure continuous, customised management.On Monday, the Rajasthan government asked the Centre for additional doses, but the Union healministry on Tuesday clarified that there was no shortage in the state. This is the first time that private hospitals have been made a part of the vaccination drive and the ministry has also allowed 24X7 vaccination for maximising the number.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vaccination-in-india-nears-2-5-cr-doses-centre-gives-7-point-agenda-to-states-101615310445006.html

The 103-year-old did not report any side effect after the vaccine was administered, reports said. She was accompanied by her 77-year-old son who also got vaccinated at Apollo Hospitals, Bannerghatta Road.Senior citizens are more vulnerable to Covid-19 infection hence they are being prioritised in the ongoing session of vaccination. Apart from them, people who are aged between 45 years and 59 years and have some co-morbidities are also eligible for vaccination.Before Kameshwari J, Mumbai's Shashikala Joshi was the oldest woman to get vaccinated. 100-year-old Joshi took her first jab on March 5 along with her daughter who is 75-year-old.On Tuesday, another 103-year-old man took his first dose of vaccine in Noida. As the claims around age are arguable, Noida's Mahabir Prasad Maheshwari is being called Noida's oldest person to have got inoculated. He was accompanied by his 81-year-old son Sudarshan Dayal who said his father was feeling fit and fine after vaccination.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/103yearold-kameshwari-j-becomes-india-s-oldest-woman-to-get-covid-19-vaccine-101615309198971.html
09-03-2021||India||ADR moves Supreme Court to stop sale of electoral bonds||Ahead of the Assembly elections in four states and a union territory, the Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR) filed an application in the Supreme Court on Tuesday to stop sale of electoral bonds till the validity of these bonds which is under examination by the top court, is finally decided.The ADR’s application was filed in a pending petition on this issue by the same organization.The petition filed by advocate Prashant Bhushan said, “There is a serious apprehension that any further sale of Electoral Bonds before the upcoming state elections in West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Assam, would further increase illegal and illicit funding of political parties through shell companies. Thus, the petitioner seeks a direction that no further opening of window for the sale of electoral bonds be allowed during the pendency of the instant writ petition.”The petitioner pointed out that the petition challenging electoral bonds is pending in the Supreme Court since September 2017. The matter was last heard on January 20 last year following which ADR had requested the Court in October last year to list the matter ahead of the Assembly elections in Bihar. However, the matter was not listed.The ADR in its PIL had sought that the amendments carried out to the Finance Act that were passed as Money Bills which provided an anonymous route for political parties to receive corporate funding through electoral bonds be struck down. This lack of transparency in the accounts of all political parties was cited as the ground by ADR to oppose this scheme. These donations enjoy 100 per cent tax exemption as they need not be reported to the Income Tax Department as well, the petition added.“The Electoral Bonds Scheme has opened the floodgates to unlimited corporate donations to political parties and anonymous financing by Indian as well as foreign companies which can have serious repercussions on the Indian democracy,” the application filed by ADR stated, adding that the Finance Act of 2017 exempts use of electoral bonds from disclosure under the Representation of Peoples Act.The ADR moved applications in March 2019 and again in November 2019 to stay the implementation of the Electoral Bond Scheme but the same was not granted. In April 2019, the Supreme Court inan interim order asked political parties to disclose to the Election Commission in sealed covers details of donations received by way of electoral bonds.In the same order, the top court had observed that the matter of electoral bonds gives rise to “weighty issues which have a tremendous bearing on the sanctity of the electoral process in the country” which require an in-depth hearing.The application on Tuesday went on to say, “As per data on Electoral Bonds declared by political parties in their audit reports for the FY 2017-18 and FY 2018-19, the ruling party had received more than 60 percent of the total electoral bonds issued till date.”So far more than Rs. 6,500 crore worth of electoral bonds have been sold with the majority of donations going to the ruling party, the ADR claimed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/adr-moves-supreme-court-to-stop-sale-of-electoral-bonds-101615307340284.html

09-03-2021||India||India summons British envoy over debate in UK Parliament on farmers' protest||India on Tuesday summoned British envoy Alex Ellis to lodge a protest against what it said was an “unwarranted and tendentious” debate in the UK Parliament that saw lawmakers criticising the Indian government’s handling of the farmers’ protest.The debate was held on Monday in response to a public petition that garnered more than 115,000 signatures, and witnessed Labour, Conservative, Liberal Democratic and Scottish National Party lawmakers calling on the Boris Johnson government to raise their concerns about the handling of the protest and media freedoms with the Indian government.Most of the British MPs acknowledged the Indian government’s agricultural reforms were a domestic matter but noted their constituents had strong links with India’s farm sector and were upset by what they described as the use of force against protesting farmers. Conservative MP Theresa Villiers was the only one of about 20 lawmakers who joined the debate to defend the Indian government’s actions.Ellis was summoned by foreign secretary Harsh Shringla and served a demarche or formal diplomatic representation that conveyed India’s “strong opposition to the unwarranted and tendentious discussion on agricultural reforms in India in the British Parliament”, according to a statement from the external affairs ministry.Shringla made it clear that the debate “represented a gross interference in the politics of another democratic country”, and he “advised that British MPs should refrain from practising vote bank politics by misrepresenting events, especially in relation to another fellow democracy”.Earlier, a statement from the Indian mission in London described the debate as a “distinctly one-sided discussion”. It said: “We deeply regret that rather than a balanced debate, false assertions – without substantiation or facts – were made, casting aspersions on the largest functioning democracy in the world and its institutions.”India’s independent democratic institutions are addressing issues raised by the British MPs, and it was a matter of concern that “comments were made to mislead the British Indian community” and raise doubts about the treatment of minorities, the statement said.Nigel Adams, the UK minister of state for Asia, while responding on behalf of the British government, said London will continue to monitor the farmers’ protest “incredibly closely”. He added, “Where we have concerns, we will continue to raise them with the Indian government while respecting the fact that these agricultural reforms are an internal matter.”Adams acknowledged the “strong feelings” about the farmers’ protest and press freedom in India and noted these issues had caused “alarm among UK citizens with ties to India”. He added, “We look to the government of India to uphold the freedoms and rights guaranteed to its people by its Constitution and by the international instruments to which India is party.”Though there is “great ambition” for the UK’s relationship with India and both sides are on shared priorities in trade, investment, defence, health and climate change that will “help fix global problems”, this doesn’t hinder London from raising difficult issues with New Delhi, he said.Prime Minister Boris John’s upcoming visit to India will be an opportunity to “discuss a range of bilateral issues where we have serious and specific concerns”, Adams said. “We will raise them directly with the Indian government as you’d expect of a friend,” he added.Several Indian-origin British MPs such as Virendra Sharma, Nadia Whittome and Seema Malhotra expressed concern about the use of force against protesting farmers. Labour Party MP Tanmanjeet Singh Dhesi, who has been at the forefront of efforts to raise the protests in Britain, said human rights are a universal issue and criticised the arrest of civil society activists and journalists.Former Labour chief Jeremy Corbyn described the farmers’ protest as the “biggest ever industrial dispute” in history while Labour MP Tahir Ali, who has his roots in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, called on the UK government to consider imposing sanctions on the Indian prime minister and government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-summons-british-envoy-over-debate-in-uk-parliament-on-farmers-protest-101615304427521.html

In other words, more than one-third of rural households are getting potable water through taps now,” it said.The ministry stressed that the drinking water supply work continued despite Covid-19 pandemic and the lockdown.“The lockdown-1 was utilised for planning activities with several rounds of discussion through video conferencing with states/UTs.

The core area with precious wildlife has not been impacted much, with fire mostly confined to the peripheral areas of the Similipal Tiger Reserve. Two teams of Odisha Disaster Rapid Action Force have been sent to the reserve," said Sandeep Tripathy, former PCCF of Odisha and head of the task force entrusted to suggest ways for containing the rising forest fires in the state.As per the Forest Survey of India's fire portal, Odisha had 20,920 fire spots in the last 7 days, the highest in the country.Tripathy said four fire brigade teams have gone deep into the forests at Barehipani, Gudugudia, Talabandha, Kendumundi, Chahala, Nawna ranges in Similipal.

He was then posted as inspector in Syana kotwali.Bhardwaj said after Singh’s death no one objected to the closure report and the court accepted it after recording the statement of the policeman who submitted the death report of the inspector in the court.A case under sections 420,153A, 120B of IPC and 66 of IT Act was registered against Som and 200 others who liked the video, allegedly uploaded by the MLA after the killing of two brothers in Kawal village of Muzaffarnagar.It is said that the video, a fake one allegedly of the killing of two persons in Afghanistan, was described as the video of the Kawal incident and shared in social media, which triggered fierce communal riots in Muzaffarnagar and Shamli district in September 2013.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/special-court-closes-case-against-bjp-mla-sangeet-som-in-muzaffarnagar-riots-101615300986263.html

The BJP government should resign and go back to people,” Yadav said.Also Read | Explained: What led Uttarakhand chief minister Rawat to resign from his postHe also termed the BJP government a failure over its handling of February’s flash floods, as well as the situation of the coronavirus pandemic in the northern state.

Rawat met the BJP top brass in the national capital on Monday amid complaints by several Uttarakhand BJP MLAs over his ‘style of governance.’ Addressing a press conference after resigning, he thanked the party for giving him an opportunity to serve as chief minister, adding that his successor would be announced after a BJP legislature party meet at 10am on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rawats-resignation-not-enough-congress-accuses-bjp-of-escape-routes-101615298177122.html
09-03-2021||India||India condemns UK parliament debate on farm stir, says it's 'vote bank politics'||India on Tuesday summoned the British high commissioner to convey its strong objection to British parliamentarians debating the three farm laws enacted last year. The ministry of external affairs said in a statement foreign secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla made it clear that the discussion in the UK parliament represented a gross interference in the politics of another country. Shringla called the debate "vote bank politics" and also highlighted that there was a misrepresentation of events."Foreign Secretary summoned the British High Commissioner and conveyed strong opposition to the unwarranted and tendentious discussion on agricultural reforms in India in the British Parliament," the statement said.A group of British MPs debated "use of force" in farmers protest in India drawing flak from the High Commission of India in London. The Indian mission said the discussion was one-sided and as British media were also present at farmers' protest site in India for reporting, the "question of lack of freedom of the media in India does not arise".Taking part in the debate which Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) minister Nigel Adams noted that India has maintained that agricultural reforms were a domestic matter. "Whilst this is an exciting time for the UK-India partnership, it does not hinder us from raising difficult issues,” the minister said and also added that the issue might feature in a candid discussion between UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Indian PM Narendra Modi when they meet in the future.The debate saw the participation of several cross-party British MPs. Opposition Labour MP for Ealing Southall in west London Virendra Sharma said, "Both sides need to step back and recognise the need to come to an agreement… I hope the government will commit to helping that cause and offer British skills in negotiation and compromise to help both sides to bring this issue to a close."The farmers' protest which has been going on at Delhi's border for over 100 days now has gained international attention primarily after Red Fort violence when protesters had a face-off with Delhi police leading to the death of one protester. In the aftermath of the incident, internet services were snapped at a few places in the Capital.India has reacted sharply to the US State Department's comment on farmers protest. In its response to the US statement, India compared the Red Fort incident with that of Capitol Hill. The Centre also objected to international celebrities like climate activist Greta Thunberg, pop star Rihanna tweeting on farmers' protest and said the action was irresponsible.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farm-reforms-discussion-in-uk-parliament-tendentious-says-india-101615296249540.html

On Tuesday morning, the protesters laid siege to the administrative block of the RINL and refused to allow senior officials from entering the premises.They gheraoed director (finance) of RINL Varanasi Venkata Venugopal Rao and held him captive for nearly six hours, refusing to allow him into the office. They freed him only at around 3 pm after the intervention of the police and the trade union leaders who held talks with the top management, which assured to take up their demands with the Centre.“We shall intensify our agitation. There is no question of allowing the steel plant to be sold out to the private parties at a throwaway price. It is a question of do-or-die battle for the workers,” said J Ayodhya Ramu, president of Centre for Indian Trade Unions (CITU), the recognised union of the RINL.On Monday, the Union finance minister, replying to questions raised by Visakhapatnam MP M V V Satyanarayana and Araku MP Goddeti Madhavi, asserted that the Centre would go in for 100 per cent disinvestment of Government of India’s shares in Visakhapatnam Steel Plant (VSP). The Centre would also withdraw RINL’s stakes in other joint ventures through strategic disinvestment.“While deciding conditions for strategic sale of RINL, concerns of employees and other stakeholders will be suitably addressed through share purchase agreement,’’ she said.Sitaraman also said the Andhra Pradesh government did not have any equity in the RINL, but the Centre was consulting the state government in specific matters as and when needed and would solicit its support in the matters that required its intervention.Stating that the Visakhapatnam Steel Plant was linked to the sentiments of the people of Andhra Pradesh, the chief minister recalled that in his previous letter to the Prime Minister on February 6, he had made a few suggestions to revive the plant.He said the steel plant would definitely turn a profitable venture given some support from the government of India instead of taking the disinvestment route by implementing some turnaround measures such as allotting captive iron ore mines to bring down the input costs, swapping high-cost debt with low-cost debt, converting debt into equity through equity conversion and monetization of vacant land.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vizag-steel-plant-workers-rise-in-protest-as-centre-firm-on-privatisation-101615295941253.html
09-03-2021||India||'Expectations are high...': BJP national general secy on Rawat's resignation||Trivendra Singh Rawat, who resigned as the chief minister of Uttarakhand on Tuesday, will be given a role at the central level said the Bharatiya Janata party’s national general secretary Dushyant Gautam.While there is speculation that Rawat was nudged to submit his resignation following unrest in the party unit in the state that goes to polls in 2022, the BJP central leadership wants to downplay his removal from the top job.Gautam, who was one of the central observers sent to Uttarakhand last week, asserted that the change in the leadership in the state should not be read as an indication of his failure as an administrator.Also read: Trivendra Singh Rawat resigns as Uttarakhand CM, day after meeting BJP top brass“The party decides who will work where. In his case, since he has the experience and has worked at the Center before, the party thought it would be more beneficial for the party to have him work at the central level,” Gautam said.Though media reports suggest that Gautam, along with the other observers such as BJP vice president Raman Singh, had heard the grievances of the party MLAs and other functionaries in Uttarakhand. Gautam denied that there was any anger against the CM.“In an election year, expectations are high as are aspirations. There is no anger against the CM; he did good work and even during the corona pandemic he ensured administrative work did not suffer,” Gautam said.Rawat's inability to forge relations with the cadre in the state unit and address the concerns of the legislators were cited as the reasons why he could not retain his job. The slow pace of work, especially when the state was preparing for the upcoming Kumbh was also listed as a reason for discontent.According to a senior party functionary, Rawat was seen to be a centre’s appointee who did not have the support of a majority of the party. What exacerbated the friction between him and the state unit was his style of functioning, his frequent visits to the capital and the decision to set up a new division in Gairsain, the summer capital of Uttarakhand.“There are several instances of friction between the state units and the CM. But in this case, he could not make peace,” said the functionary.A former RSS Pracharak, Rawat has served as the state unit chief in Uttarakhand and as the state agriculture minister.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/expectations-are-high-bjp-national-general-secy-on-rawat-s-resignation-101615295309674.html
09-03-2021||India||Uttarakhand CM’s resignation is failure of 4 years of BJP govt, says Congress||The Congress unit in Uttarakhand said Tuesday that the change of guard in the BJP government a year ahead of elections shows that the saffron party’s reign of 4 years so far has been a failure.The Congress broadside came shortly after Trivendra Singh Rawat resigned as chief minister Tuesday afternoon after returning from New Delhi where he had met the BJP top brass.Harish Rawat, senior Congress leader and former chief minister said these political developments in the BJP are making it clearly evident that four years of Trivendra Singh Rawat’s government were a failure and that Congress would return to power in the 2022 assembly elections in the state.“Even the BJP leadership realised that he has failed. This change shows now nothing can stop the Congress from coming to power in the state. He disrespected Mahakumbh by shortening its tenure to one month. He didn’t do much for the employment of youth in the state, for the farmers, who continue to struggle in the hill state”, he said.Suryakant Dhasmana, state Congress vice president said the development shows that The BJP was not happy with the performance of Trivendra Singh Rawat.“BJP has cheated the people of the state and people will give a befitting reply in 2022 elections by electing Congress to power. In a way it is not the failure of Rawat, but of PM Narendra Modi who had made many promises to the people of the state during his election rallies in 2017”.Dhasmana wondered what message the BJP was trying to convey by changing the CM at this juncture.“These developments clearly show how BJP is in disarray in the state and all this has come to the surface now with Trivendra Singh Rawat’s removal from the post of CM. With such conflict in the party, you can well imagine their focus. People and even their own legislators were not happy with the way the government was functioning,” he saidThe Aam Aadmi Party which recently launched a massive membership drive in Uttarakhand, also said the BJP’s days in the state are numbered.AAP’s Uttarakhand unit chief SS Kaler claimed that the party would capture power in the assembly election and said that they have been saying for many months that the BJP government has failed to fulfill the promises it had made to the people of the state.“Our stand has now been vindicated as the BJP central leadership also felt that the CM needs to be changed and that too, a year before the elections. They have betrayed the trust of people and in the 2022 elections and the people will give a befitting reply by electing the AAP government in the state. This change makes our way clear for making strong inroads in Uttarakhand and give people a better model of governance,” he saidDevendra Bhasin, state BJP spokesperson, said that traditionally important decisions in the party are taken by the party high command.“The party after taking into consideration all aspects took this decision and it is acceptable to us,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-cm-s-resignation-is-failure-of-4-years-of-bjp-govt-says-congress-101615293817720.html

And there is no match for his commitment and dedication towards the nation. We have a vibrant opposition, what we need is a vibrant and free press," Gehlot said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/people-have-faith-in-gandhis-cong-united-under-sonia-rajasthan-cm-gehlot-101615292992774.html

09-03-2021||India||Assam assembly elections: All set for 1st phase; biggies including CM in fray||With filing of nominations coming to a close on Tuesday, battle lines for the first phase of Assam assembly polls on March 27 have been drawn. The crucial phase, where 47 seats in 11 districts, especially in upper Assam go for polls, would see many political bigwigs including chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal in fray.On Tuesday, Sonowal filed nomination papers from Majuli, the world’s largest river island, which he represented in 2016 as well. The CM was accompanied by Asom Gana Parishad (AGP) president Atul Bora, state BJP chief Ranjeet Kumar Dass and senior minister Himanta Biswa Sarma and other dignitaries.“We all want peace, security and development. And the BJP-led coalition has been able to provide all that successfully in the past five years. I thank you all for your blessings and seek your support again,” Sonowal said at a rally later.Besides the CM, the first phase will also have AGP chief Atul Bora in fray from Bokakhat and state Congress chief Ripun Bora from Gohpur. Chiefs of two newly formed parties, Lurinjyoti Gogoi of Assam Jatiya Parishad (AJP) and Akhil Gogoi of Raijor Dal, are also contesting on March 27.“Grateful for the tremendous outpouring of love and support of people, who joined me during the filing of nomination. Congress will win all the seats, we are contesting,” Ripun Bora said on Monday.Lurinjyoti will be contesting from Duliajana and Naharkatiya, while Akhi, who’s under arrest since December 2019 for his role in anti-Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) protests, filed his nomination papers from Guwahati Medical College Hospital for Sivasagar and Mariani seats.The seats in the first phase would be important for BJP, if they have to achieve their target of winning over 100 of the total 126 seats in the assembly. In 2016, the BJP-AGP combine had won 35 of these 47 seats, helping the saffron party to come to power for the first time in Assam.“Congress will not be able to win a single seat in upper Assam in the first phase. In 2016, we had won 27 of these seats. This time we will win seven more seats,” state BJP chief Ranjeet Kumar Dass said.Constituencies in the first phase fall in the tea-rich belt and both BJP and Congress have tried their best to woo the tea-tribe community whose votes play a decisive role in about 35-40 seats in the first phase.Besides several schemes for the community launched by the state government, Prime Minister Narendra Modi also addressed his first public meeting in Sivasagar in January.

09-03-2021||India||No plan to aid gas-based power plants at this juncture, says Power Minister||The government has decided to not provide support to gas-based power plants that are stranded or running at a sub-optimal level in view of the states' reluctance to give any concession to these projects and rise in capacity utilisation of these plants, Parliament was informed on Tuesday."In the light of the reluctance of the States to give any waiver/ concession and the fact that gas-based power generation grew without any support, it was decided that there may not be any need to have any policy on providing support to the gas-based power plants at this juncture," Power Minister RK Singh said in a written reply to the Rajya Sabha.The minister told the House that the gas prices were falling since last year and in 2019-20 the plant load factor (PLF or capacity utilisation) of gas-based generating stations was 22.15% and until August 2020, despite lower demand due to Covid-19, the PLF of gas-based power plants had risen to 26.64%.This has happened without any support due to lower LNG price, the minister added.According to the reply, the proposal to revive the e-RLNG (gas subsidy) scheme to provide support to the gas-based plants was examined. The views of the states regarding waivers and concessions of state government taxes and levies were sought.The minister said, "State Governments are of the view that the proposed concession/waivers for the revival of gas-based plants are not feasible/viable in current scenarios and they are not in favour of exemption of Goods and Services Tax (GST) on transportation of the scheme gas".In order to revive and improve the utilisation of gas-based capacity in the country, the government had sanctioned a scheme for utilisation of gas-based power generation capacity for the years 2015-16 and 2016-17.The scheme envisaged supply of imported spot Re-gasified Liquified Natural Gas (RLNG) to the stranded gas-based plants as well as plants receiving domestic gas, selected through a reverse e-bidding process.The scheme also envisaged sacrifices to be made collectively by all stakeholders and support from Power System Development Fund (PSDF). The scheme ended on March 31, 2017.The Central Electricity Authority (CEA) monitors gas supply position in respect of 2,3902 MW capacity of gas-based power plants in the country on a monthly basis. During the year 2020-2021 (up to January 2021) out of the total capacity of 2,3902 MW, only 5,438.50 MW capacity has nil generation due to non-availability of gas, Singh told the House.In a separate reply, the minister said the hydropower generation in the country is projected to be higher at 150.01 billion units (BU) compared to the planned 140.35 BU in 2020-21.Hydropower generation in the country is recorded at 141.28 BU till February 26, 2021 (this fiscal) from 46.20GW installed generation capacity as on February 28, 2021.In another reply to the House, Singh stated that the power consumption in the country fell 3.2% to 1,046.77 BU during April-January this fiscal from 1,081.67 BU in the same period in 2019-20. The power consumption or energy supplied in 2019-20 was 1,284.44 BU."In the current year 2020-21 (up to January 2021), there was a slight contraction in demand of electric energy in the first quarter due to Covid-19 pandemic, which has again picked up since the month of September 2020," he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-plan-to-aid-gas-based-power-plants-at-this-juncture-says-power-minister-101615292169628.html
09-03-2021||India||Explained: What led Uttarakhand chief minister Rawat to resign from his post||Uttarakhand chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat submitted his resignation to Governor Baby Rani Maurya on Tuesday. "The party took a collective decision that someone else should be given a chance as Uttarakhand chief minister," Rawat said after meeting the governor. Prior to their meeting, it was widely reported that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader might resign from his post.Rawat’s resignation came hours after he returned to Dehradun on Tuesday morning after meeting senior BJP leaders in Delhi. Up until Monday, the BJP denied speculations about any leadership change in the state. “CM Rawat would discuss the events on March 18 to mark the completion of four years of this government and the election strategy for upcoming state assembly elections to be held in 2022,” BJP’s state president Bansidhar Bhagat said on Monday.When did speculations of CM Rawat resigning start?The speculations started after a sudden core committee meeting of the BJP took place on Saturday. The meeting is said to be called upon by central observers, including former Chhattisgarh chief minister Raman Singh and the state unit in-charge Gautam, which was attended by 45 party MLAs. It has been reported that a section of the leaders of the state was not happy with Rawat’s leadership and believed that he may not be able to lead the party to success in the elections due in February 2022. After the meeting, chief minister Rawat left for Delhi to meet the BJP’s central leadership on Monday morning.What happened during Rawat’s visit to Delhi?Rawat met BJP national president JP Nadda, Union home minister Amit Shah and party general secretary BL Santhosh. After the visit, Rawat returned to Uttarakhand on Tuesday morning.How has the Congress reacted to the issue?Senior Congress leader Harish Rawat said it does not matter who is replaced by Rawat as the BJP is set to lose in the assembly elections due in 2022. "I can see a change in power happening. Even the BJP's central leadership has admitted that its present government in the state could not do much. No matter who they bring now they will not come back to power in 2022," Rawat, who is a former chief minister of the hill state, said.Who are the probable contenders for the chief minister’s post?Union education minister Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank and state tourism minister Satpal Maharaj are said to be among the probable front runners for the position. State minister Dhan Singh Rawat and senior leaders Ajay Bhatt and Anil Baluni could also be considered for the top post.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/explained-what-led-uttarakhand-chief-minister-rawat-to-resign-from-his-post-101615284880456.html

But as Scindia chose a different path and left the party to become a backbencher on the BJP, now he can never become the chief minister."Write it down, he will never become Chief Minister there. He will have to come back here for that," Rahul said.In March last year, Jyotiraditya Scindia joined the BJP leading to the fall of the Kamal Nath government in Madhya Pradesh. Senior Congress leader of the state Digvijaya Singh had said Scindia was offered the post of the deputy CM but he turned it down and wanted to place someone else, which was rejected by Kamal Nath. In his defence, Scindia at that time said that he refused the post as he wanted to work for the people.The episode saw a near re-run in Rajasthan after Congress leader Sachin Pilot turned into a rebel but was later placated by the Ashok Gehlot government.Rahul Gandhi and Jyotiraditya Scindia's association goes back a long way and after Scindia left the party, Rahul said they went to the college together and his doors were always open for Scindia. "Jyotiraditya is the only one who can walk into my house anytime... He was with me in college," Rahul had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jyotiradityas-reply-to-rahul-s-backbencher-jibe-had-he-been-this-worried-101615290626365.html

Following persecution in their country, many of them entered India illegally through Bangladesh and took shelter in Jammu and other parts of the country.Many political parties and social organisations in Jammu have urged the Centre to take immediate steps for the deportation of Rohingyas and Bangladeshi nationals, alleging that their presence is a "conspiracy to alter the demographic character" in the region and a "threat to peace".More than 13,700 foreigners, including Rohingya Muslims and Bangladeshi nationals, are settled in Jammu and Samba districts of Jammu and Kashmir, where their population has increased by over 6,000 between 2008 and 2016, according to government data.“The decision of Jammu and Kashmir authorities to send at least 168 Rohingya refugees to a holding center needs a review as the issue needs to be seen through humanitarian angle rather than political,” the CPI(M) leader said in a statement here.Kesar said following persecution in their country, thousands of Rohingyas entered India through Bangladesh and some of them took shelter in Jammu also.“They were forced to leave their country and take temporary shelter in India and other countries to save their lives. Once the situation improves in their homeland, they must be asked to go back,” he said.However, he said as of now the situation has not improved in their homeland and forcing them to go back at this juncture would be “injustice” to them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rohingya-refugees-issue-must-be-seen-through-humanitarian-angle-cpim-101615288346564.html

We immediately shifted her to Osmania General Hospital in Hyderabad, where she died on Tuesday morning,” Alladurg sub-inspector of police A Mohan Reddy said.Initially, the police suspected that Sathli Bai was attacked with acid, but later it was revealed that the accused poured petrol over her and set her ablaze. “Based on a statement from Sathli Bai in the hospital, we picked up a person for questioning. We shall reveal further details later,” the SI said.According to the police, the woman and her two daughters had been staying with her parents at Malkapur for the last couple of years, after her husband was killed in a family dispute. She had been earning her livelihood by working as an agricultural labourer.On Sunday evening, Sathli Bai left for the market in the nearby Jogipet town to buy some groceries, but did not return home till late in the night. The following morning, some villagers of Gadipeddapur noticed her lying on the outskirts of the village with severe burn injuries and informed the police.“We took her first to Jogipet area hospital and after first aid, we moved her to Osmania Hospital in Hyderabad,” Mohan Reddy said.

If I had got scared, I could have done something about it," Jarkiholi said, addressing the media formally for the first time since the sex-scandal rocked the BS Yediyurappa-led Karnataka government."I got a call 26 hours in advance from the high command, from my well wishers that your CD will be released by 5-6 pm the next day. They asked me to take precautionary legal action but I still did not do it. This is a major political conspiracy," he added, almost choking on words.The former minister said that he resigned by himself and was never asked to step down from the cabinet. He said that it was more important for him to get back the lost respect of his family."No matter how much it costs or how powerful they (alleged conspirators) are, will not spare them until we jail them," said the former minister.The withdrawal of the complaint by social activist Dinesh Kalahalli has given the BJP legislator confidence to counter the charges.Since the complaint by Kalahalli, the Gokak MLA was forced to resign from his post in the cabinet.Kalahalli had alleged that Jarkiholi had sexually exploited an unnamed woman on the false promise of getting her a job in the Karnataka Power Transmission Corporation Limited (KPTCL).Jarkiholi has called the video fake. His brother Balachandra Jarkiholi on Sunday said that the conspirators spent over ₹15 crore to upload the video in Russia.Ramesh added to the theory, stating that the entire conspiracy was hatched in two apartments around Yeshwantpur area of Bengaluru. He said that there are two main conspirators and at least seven more behind them who hatched the plan. He refused to divulge any more details.Ramesh was one of the first of at least 17 legislators to defect from the HD Kumaraswamy-led Janata Dal (Secular) or JD(S)-Congress coalition government in 2019.Ramesh thanked Kumaraswamy and his family for standing by him during the entire episode.Kumaraswamy had alleged that a "deal" of ₹5 crore was struck in the case.Six other ministers who defected from the JD(S) have also approached the courts, seeking an injunction on any future publishing or broadcasting of any defamatory content against them.The Karnataka government is also drafting a legislation that aims to check and punish those who try to defame eminent personalities and politicians.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/conspiracy-fake-videos-bjp-s-ramesh-jarkiholi-on-alleged-sex-tape-row-101615289322182.html

If the plane has already taken off, the judge ordered action should be taken against delinquent passengers that could include permanently barring them from flying.Justice C Hari Shankar also told airlines to amend their inflight announcement. The judge said they should not only remind passengers that they must properly wear their masks, which they already do, but should also underline the penal action that will follow if they don’t adhere to the protocol.Justice Shankar had travelled on a flight from Kolkata to Delhi on 5 March (Friday) and was appalled by the lack of compliance to the Covid-19 protocol; primarily the rule that requires passengers to wear a mask covering their nose and mouth at all times. Once he reached home, the judge tried looking for the official orders for flyers but had trouble locating them on the aviation regulator, Directorate General of Civil Aviation’s (DGCA) website.He did find some news reports on the rule allowing airlines to put flyers who do not wear masks on a no-fly list.On Monday, the judge took suo motu notice of his experience and initiated a case that is being treated as public interest litigation by the high court.“It was noticed that, though all the passengers had worn masks, many passengers had worn the masks below their chin and were exhibiting a stubborn reluctance to wear their masks properly,” the judge wrote in his eight-page order, detailing his experience.“It was only on repeated entreaties made (by me) to the offending passengers that they condescended to wear their masks properly,” the judge said, pointing that when he asked the cabin crew why they didn’t enforce the rule, they claimed that they were helpless.This situation, the judge said, was "completely unconscionable" at a time when the country is seeing a resurgence of Covid-19 cases. "Passengers in a flight are in a closed air-conditioned environment, and, even if one of the passengers suffers from Covid, the effect on other passengers could be cataclysmic”.The high court issued a set of seven guidelines for airlines, passengers and the aviation regulator.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/judge-was-appalled-by-what-he-saw-on-kolkata-delhi-flight-issues-7-point-order-101615284850650.html

09-03-2021||India||Uttarakhand crisis: BJP may bring in 'CM-deputy CM' system as Rawat resigns||As Uttarakhand Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat resigned on Tuesday, putting an end to speculations of a change in the political leadership of the state, the BJP has already drafted its new blueprint in which there will be a deputy chief minister — a tested model of BJP governance.News agency PTI reported that the deputy CM post may go to Khatime constituency MLA Pushkar Singh Dhami.For the CM post, three names have emerged — Dhan Singh Rawat, the education minister of the state, and Parliament members Ajay Bhatt and Anil Baluni.The state will be going to the elections in 2022. With one year left in his term, what triggered this political crisis in the state, apart from a few MLAs' disapproval of Rawat's style of government is not clear. In 2017, the party came to power winning 57 out of 70 seats.The crisis came to the fore when the central BJP leadership sent two observers, party vice president Raman Singh and general secretary Dushyant Kumar Gautam, to Uttarakhand to get feedback from the party's core group in the state amid reports of discontent against the chief minister.Raman Singh talked to each member of Uttarakhand BJP's core committee, which includes Rajya Sabha member Naresh Bansal, Tehri MP Mala Rajya Lakshmi Shah, former chief minister Vijay Bahuguna, Nainital MP Ajay Bhatt, cabinet minister Madan Kaushik, minister of state Dhan Singh Rawat, state BJP general secretary Ajeya Kumar, among others.Till Monday, the BJP leadership was trying to paper over the developments as the visit of the observers was termed as a visit ahead of the government's four-year anniversary which is on March 18.

If a passenger, despite being reminded more than once in flight, refuses to follow this protocol, action should be taken against the passenger in accordance with the guidelines issued by the DGCA [Directorate General of Civil Aviation] or Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, including placing the passenger on a ‘no-fly’ regimen, either permanently or for a stipulated, sufficiently long, period,” justice Hari Shankar said. He cited “the stubbornness of the fellow passengers in wearing masks below their chins” on the flight.Also Read | Plea to delay judicial exam till lawyers get vaccinated transferred to new benchThe court asked the DGCA to put up on its website the guidelines and protocols for the passengers and cabin crew. It directed all airlines to ensure written instructions regarding the protocol to be followed be given to passengers along with the boarding passes. The court added the instructions should include the measures that could be taken against passengers in case of violations of the protocol. It said the passengers should be sensitised regarding their responsibility.Shankar said the in-flight crew shall carry out periodical checks of the aircraft to ensure all passengers are complying with the protocol, especially regarding masks. “...masks should be worn as directed by governmental instructions, covering the nose and mouth, and not worn merely covering the mouth or below the chin.”The court said the resurgence of Covid-19 cases after they showed signs of ebbing is completely unconscionable. “Passengers in a flight are in a closed air-conditioned environment, and, even if one of the passengers suffers from Covid, the effect on other passengers could be cataclysmic,” it said. “It is a matter of common knowledge that being within arm’s length distance of a Covid carrier, even if he is asymptomatic and is merely speaking, is more than sufficient to transmit the virus.”Shankar said there may be a medical necessity for some passengers for not wearing the mask and such cases must be the exception after due and strict assessment. He directed the airlines to ensure such passengers are isolated and kept at a safe distance from others.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/airlines-can-take-action-against-passengers-not-wearing-masks-delhi-hc-101615285701771.html

With the connectivity, there will be an increase in economic opportunities of people of both the countries," Modi said while inaugurating the bridge through video conference.The Maitri bridge will now facilitate access to Bangladesh's Chittagong port, only 80 kilometres away from Sabroom.Besides the bridge, Modi laid foundation stones for different infrastructure projects in Tripura that included of Integrated Check Post (ICP) at Sabroom in South district, national highway 208 connecting Unakoti and Khowai district headquarters, state highways, district roads, 40,978 houses under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana, Integrated Command and Control Centre under Agartala Smart City Mission, multi-level car parking and commercial complex, widening of a double lane road to four lanes.Prior the 2018 assembly polls, Modi had promised to give the state development in the form of HIRA- Highways, I-ways, Railways and Airways.“All these projects are part of HIRA. And the waterways have also been added to it. Tripura today has received the rural roads, expansion of highways, bridge, infrastructural projects as gifts," he said.He also congratulated the BJP government on completing three years in power, Modi said that the state witnessed series of developments in different sectors due to “double-engine government” – a term used to define the Centre and the state governments where the same party is in power.Modi said that Tripura now has ease of doing business after moving out of the “hartal culture” of the past."Tripura people have scripted a new era three years back. Now, they can feel the comparison between 30 years of the previous government and BJP's three years government. Earlier, no work was possible without commission and corruption and now, all the government benefits reach to beneficiary through their personal bank accounts. The employees are now getting salary as per Seventh Pay Commission, the MNREGA wages per day have been hiked from ₹135 to ₹205," he said.“Tripura was allotted ₹350 crore for implementation of different centrally-sponsored schemes between 2009-2014. And in our government’s period since 2014 Tripura received over ₹12,000 crores.

The administration may also reasonably restrict so as to avoid mass gatherings," he said."As large congregation on the occasion of Mahashivratri has a large potential of spreading Covid-19 infections, Collectors and Municipal Commissioners may restrict congregations/ gatherings to such number as may be felt appropriate considering the situation there and space available within such temples and its premises to gather, strictly adhering to the Covid-19 protocols," Jena said.He said that any person found violating the order shall be punishable under the provisions of the Disaster Management Act, 2005 and other relevant laws.Major Shiv Peeths or temples such as that of Shree Lingaraj in Bhubaneswar and Baba Akandalamani in Bahdark have restricted night-gathering and mass diya burning during Mahashivratri.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-govt-asks-districts-to-ensure-covid-guidelines-on-mahashivratri-101615284357768.html
09-03-2021||India||‘Reservation in jobs for locals in Haryana contradicts RSS’s stance’||Haryana’s decision to bring in a law to reserve of 75% of private-sector jobs with a salary cap of ₹50,000 monthly for locals contradicts the “one nation, one people” stance of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), the ideological fount of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), said an RSS functionary, familiar with the organisation’s thinking on the matter. The Sangh’s position assumes importance given that it is a BJP-led government, which has brought in the legislation. The RSS functionary blamed political expediency for the move even as the BJP-Jannayak Janta Party government, which faces a no-confidence motion on Wednesday, has called it a fulfilment of a key election promise. “You cannot stop the migration of people for jobs. Such decisions have a fallout. Take the example of Bihar, where the ban on consumption of alcohol has not been effective on the ground. A similar experiment was done in Haryana by Bansi Lal when he banned alcohol [consumption] but the results on the ground showed that illegal liquor stores had sprung up all across the state,” said the RSS functionary, referring to the 1996 prohibition that was rolled back two years later under public pressure.The functionary pointed out Haryana would end up losing revenue if the decision is not revoked. “Companies will find a way around the law, but it is the state that will lose revenue.”Also Read | Is Haryana’s new reservation law constitutionally tenable?BJP leaders refused to comment on the Sangh functionary’s view, but on the merit of the issue, a BJP leader cited similar moves in other states and added they can be viewed as affirmative steps. “There are provisions in the law that give the state powers to take steps for positive discrimination in favour of those who are deprived or neglected. In several states, reservation for local residents in the private sector has been announced,” the leader said, requesting anonymity. He was referring to the laws in Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, and Madhya Pradesh, which have been challenged in court. Legal experts, however, believe that the law will find it hard to meet the constitutional test of equality and non discrimination.A second BJP leader acknowledged queries from industrialists and manufacturers on how the policy will be implemented on the ground. “There are some concerns, especially now that Haryana is seen as an industrial production destination. There are fears that the workforce needed will not be available. But the government has assured that it will address concerns,” said the second leader, who did not want to be named. The leader added a large percentage of those employed in the salary band of under ₹50,000 are migrant workers.Haryana deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala said the state government held eight rounds of meeting with industry associations before finalising the reservation. “After consultations, if we have to incorporate some technical things in the rules, will do that so that industry comes to our state in an even bigger way,” he said.As per the 2011 census, Haryana, along with Maharashtra, Delhi, Gujarat, and Uttar Pradesh, is home to 50% of the country’s interstate migrants. In 2020, when Haryana launched a portal to facilitate the movement of migrant workers to their states in view of the Covid-19 pandemic, 800,000 people registered to move out.Welcoming the Sangh’s intervention on the issue, Professor Amitabh Kundu, distinguished fellow at the New Delhi-based think tank Research and Information System for Developing Countries, said, “I am happy if the Sangh parivar has decided to take up the issue of discrimination in jobs based on place of origin. Such reservations that are borne out of political compulsions are against the Indian constitution and against the inter state migrant act,” Kundu said. He added that states such as Haryana that have significant inbound migrant population should think about the repercussions of the law. “Even states such as Madhya Pradesh, which have a high out- migration population and have announced similar reservation, should consider how their people will be treated in other states,” Kundu said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/reservation-in-jobs-for-locals-in-haryana-contradicts-rss-s-stance-101615284441690.html

09-03-2021||India||New India-Bangladesh bridge boosts access to Chattogram port||A new bridge between India and Bangladesh opened on Tuesday will boost trade and connectivity and make Agartala, the capital of the northeastern state of Tripura, the Indian city closest to an international sea port. Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated the 1.9-km bridge over Feni river, built at a cost of ₹133 crore, during a video conference. His Bangladesh counterpart Sheikh Hasina said in a video message the bridge will be a “trading lifeline” for northeastern India as it cuts the distance between Agartala and Chattogram port to less than 100 km. The Maitri Setu or “friendship bridge” was inaugurated a little more than a fortnight before Modi’s visit to Dhaka to join celebrations marking the golden jubilee of Bangladesh’s independence and 50 years of diplomatic ties. It is the latest in a slew of connectivity initiatives aimed at linking India’s landlocked northeastern states to new markets. Modi said connectivity is strengthening friendship between the two sides and the region is being developed as a trade corridor between northeast India and Bangladesh. Rail and water connectivity projects completed in recent years will be strengthened by the bridge, he said. “Due to this bridge over Feni river, Agartala will become the Indian city that is nearest to an international sea port,” Modi said. Also Read | PM Modi to travel to Bangladesh on March 26, his first visit abroad in 15 monthsNoting that the bridge’s foundation stone was laid during his visit to Dhaka in June 2015, Modi thanked Hasina and her government for helping to complete the project. Besides Tripura, the bridge will improve connectivity for south Assam, Mizoram and Manipur and boost economic opportunities within Bangladesh, he added. The construction of a ₹232-crore integrated check post (ICP) at Sabroom, which will be a logistics hub with parking lot, warehousing and container trans-shipment facilities, will further boost trade, while the widening of National Highways 8 and 208 will facilitate the movement of local produce to new markets across the border, Modi said. In her video message, Hasina said: “The opening of Feni bridge is testimony to the Bangladesh government’s continued commitment to support our neighbour India in strengthening connectivity in the region, particularly for the northeast of India.” She added, “This bridge will be a trading lifeline for the northeast of India. As you all know, Bangladesh has already allowed the use of Chattogram and Mongla ports for the movement of goods to and from India.” Earlier, the nearest sea port for Agartala was Kolkata, located at a distance of more than 1,600 km, whereas the new bridge will reduce the distance between Agartala and Chattogram to less than 100 km, Hasina pointed out. At the same time, Hasina outlined her expectations for Indian support to help Bangladesh trade with other regional countries. “We are creating a new era in South Asia through providing connectivity to India. We are in a region which has remained conservative in opening up and where inter-regional trade is far below potential,” she said. “I believe political boundaries should not become physical barriers to trade. We expect the framework that we are inaugurating today will also help Bangladesh to trade more easily not only with India but also with Nepal and Bhutan,” she added. Bangladesh wants to maximise the advantages accruing from its location to become a connectivity hub between South and Southeast Asia, and the cross-border transport system being developed with India will enable her country to play an important role in regional trade, Hasina said. She also highlighted India’s role in Bangladesh’s war of independence in 1971. Switching to Bengali, she said: “We haven’t forgotten how, in 1971, you sheltered our people and supported us and cooperated with us so that we became victorious in our war of independence.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/new-india-bangladesh-bridge-boosts-access-to-chattogram-port-101615283183726.html

The restrictive measures can be a partial lockdown or night curfew or a complete lockdown, or just amping up testing etc., the minister said. But the decision will be entirely of the local administration."In Mumbai, cases are a bit higher. The Chief Minister has instructed all administration officers to take a decision on whatever is necessary; be it imposing a partial lockdown, increasing testing, or go for a complete lockdown," Shaikh said.All districts of Maharashtra are seeing an uptick in the number of daily infections since mid-February. Starting from the Vidarbha region, the spike has spread to Marathwada and now Mumbai, as well. For the last six days, Mumbai has been reporting over 1,000 new cases daily.The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation, at this moment, is concentrating more on tightening surveillance. Residential buildings with more than five active Covid-19 patients are being sealed; nightclubs, wedding venues are on the radar; marshals are penalising people found without masks or flouting Covid-19 norms.But if these measures fail, then sea beaches, the Gateway of India might have to be shut. Night clubs might also be closed down as several of them have been found violating social distancing norms in the last few days. As far as people's movement is concerned, the decision rests with the local authority, the minister said.Authorities were also mulling whether to bring back restrictions on Mumbai local trains, which expanded its services since February 1, just before the spike was noticed. No decision has been taken in this regard.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mumbai-covid-19-spike-local-authorities-can-impose-restrictions-lockdown-101615281353236.html

As per the guidelines, the pilots and other crew members will be considered "temporarily unfit for flying" for 48 days after receiving each dose of the vaccine. They will be monitored for 30 minutes at the vaccination centre for any "anaphylactic or idiosyncratic" reaction.The aircrew will be allowed to resume their "unrestricted flying duties" after they fail to show any concerning symptoms within the said period, the guidelines further said.In case the aircrew experiences any symptoms after 48 hours of the vaccination, a physician or company doctor will review their condition. "Such pilots can be declared fit for flying duties provided they are asymptomatic without any medications and a medical cure certificate to this effect to be obtained," the DGCA stated.In case the medical unfitness period post-vaccination continues for more than 14 days, then a 'Special Medical Examination' will be required to ascertain fitness for flying.India rolled out a massive vaccination drive in the country on January 16. Since then it has inoculated more than 20 million people. During the first phase of the drive, only health workers and frontline workers were allowed to be administered the vaccine.The second phase commenced on March 1 during which the government allowed those above 60 to be vaccinated. People are above 45 and below 60 can also get themselves vaccinated after presenting a specified co-morbidity certificate.So far, the government is vaccinating people for free of cost. People also have an option of private vaccination centres where they get the jab at their own convenience. They will have to ₹250 to get the vaccine at private centres.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dgca-issues-post-vaccination-guidelines-for-aircrew-101615281262776.html

Earlier today, he returned to Dehradun after meeting the BJP leadership yesterday in Delhi amid complaints by a section of party MLas over his “style of governance”.The CM has called a press meet, where he may announce his resignation before meeting with governor Baby Rani Maurya.Upon his return, the CM was welcomed by his supporters at the state capital's Jolly Grant Airport. During his Delhi visit, he met BJP national president JP Nadda, home minister Amit Shah and party general secretary BL Santhosh.Dhan Singh Rawat is reportedly flying to the state capital via private chopper amid buzz around leadership change.Earlier, amid the soaring tension over the leadership issue, the CM had attended an urgent core committee meeting called upon by central observers including former Chhattisgarh CM Raman Singh and state unit in-charge Gautam on Saturday. Forty-five party MLAs also flew down to Dehradun from Gairsain in an abrupt manner on Saturday in the core committee meeting which was called after a section of party MLAs expressed resentment over the CM's leadership style."The reports of Rawat being replaced as the CM is wrong. He will remain the CM of the state and under him the party will contest the next assembly elections in 2022," said state president Bansidhar Bhagat, adding that the CM had gone to Delhi to discuss the preparations for the events to mark the completion of four years of the BJP government on March 18.State unit in-charge Gautam too refuted the reports of leadership change while speaking to mediapersons and said "there is no reason to replace him.""Why would the party replace him? There are no corruption charges against him. He has brought many significant public welfare programmes like providing water connection at Re 1 and making the state the first one in the country to give Atal Ayushmann health card to all for free treatment up to ₹5 lakh in any hospital of the state," said Gautam.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/trivendra-rawat-back-in-uttarakhand-after-delhi-visit-amid-removal-reports-101615280996624.html

According to the roster, all the PILs are to be listed before the bench headed by the chief justice. Let it be listed before Division Bench-I on March 12," the court said.The court was hearing a petition filed by one of the candidates who is going to appear for the examination.In the plea, the petitioner said he is suffering from severe medical conditions, leaving him at risk of serious and life-threatening complications if he contracts coronavirus.Senior advocate Malhotra, representing the petitioner, said all the candidates are in the age group of 32 to 47 years and mostly suffering from blood pressure and diabetes problems, and let the lawyers get vaccinated then the exam can be held after a month."It is a serious issue. Everyone's safety is important,” he said.On being asked by the court if the petition was in the nature of PIL, the counsel said it can be treated as a PIL as it was affecting everyone.The petition, filed through advocates Aditya Kapoor, Kushal Kumar, Harsh Ahuja and Akash Deep Gupta, sought quashing of February 18 notification issued by the Delhi High Court notifying the schedule of the examinations on March 13 and 14.The petitioner said he is a meritorious and middle-aged person who is suffering from severe health problems of cancer and had undergone radiation therapy with administration of chemotherapy doses and is currently having an extremely weak immunity.He said he is at a higher risk of severe complications from contracting coronavirus.The plea claimed that the notice is violative of the fundamental rights by forcing the candidates, like the petitioner, to risk their health and safety in the current situation of the COVID-19 pandemic.It said many states, including Delhi, are witnessing a rise in COVID-19 cases and there are more than 1,701 active cases in the national capital as of March 4, 2021, and around 240 new cases per day are getting detected on a daily basis."In view of the resurgence of COVID-19 cases in many states, including Delhi, the conduct of main exams in the month of March 2021 would unjustly expose the candidates, including the petitioner to the high risks of contracting coronavirus."It is also submitted that many candidates, including the petitioner for the exam, are of matured age and most of them also have compromised immunity due to various ailments,” the petition submitted.It also referred to recent suo moto cognisance taken by the high court on the demand for vaccinating judges, court staff and lawyers on a priority basis and said it might be possible that the issue of vaccination is decided by the central government soon and it would allow lawyers to get vaccinated and thereby diminishing the risk of contracting the virus."The absence of any urgency to conduct the main examinations and presence of the risks involved in conducting the examinations thus call for the postponement of the main examinations," the petition said.The result of the preliminary examinations was declared on February 13 last year, wherein 280 candidates were shortlisted to appear for the Delhi Higher Judicial Service Main Examination (Written)-2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/plea-to-delay-judicial-exam-till-lawyers-get-vaccinated-transferred-to-new-bench-101615280736542.html

Lancet also said that efficacy cannot be determined by phase 2 trials. “We report interim findings of the phase 2 trial on the immunogenicity and safety of BBV152, with the first dose administered on day 0 and the second dose on day 28,” the report published on Monday said.Covaxin induced high neutralising antibody responses that remained elevated in all participants at 3 months after the second vaccination in the Phase 1 trial, it said. “In the phase 2 trial, BBV152 showed better reactogenicity and safety outcomes, and enhanced humoral and cell-mediated immune responses compared with the phase 1 trial. The 6 μg with Algel-IMDG formulation has been selected for the phase 3 efficacy trial,” it said.Also watch | ‘Covaxin has 81% efficacy’: Bharat Biotech phase 3 trial results“BBV152 (developed using a well established manufacturing platform) was safe, immunogenic (persisting for 3 months), and can be stored at 2–8°C, which is compatible with the immunisation cold chain requirements of most countries. Follow-up studies to assess efficacy and immune responses in older adults and in people with comorbidities are underway,” it added.The Lancet study enrolled a small number of participants aged 12-18 years and 55-65 years. “Follow-on studies are required to establish immunogenicity in children and in those aged 65 years and older,” it said noting the study population lacked ethnic, racial, and gender diversity, “further underscoring the importance of evaluating BBV152 in other populations.”Also read | Covaxin demonstrates prowess of Atmanirbhar Bharat, says ICMR chiefThe Lancet report says the results reported in the study of phase 2 results do not permit efficacy assessments and the “evaluation of safety outcomes requires extensive phase 3 clinical trials.” "We were unable to assess other immune responses (ie, binding antibody and cell-mediated responses) in convalescent serum samples due to the low quantity. Furthermore, no additional data on the age of the participant or the severity of disease from symptomatic individuals were obtained. Comparisons between phase 1 and 2 trials were not done in a randomised set of participants, and no adjustments on baseline parameters were made. Conclusions are to be considered as post-hoc analyses," it said.Bharat Biotech announced earlier this month that preliminary results show Covaxin has an efficacy of 81% in phase 3 clinical trial amid months of speculations to rest. “Today is an important milestone in vaccine discovery, for science and our fight against coronavirus disease. With today’s results from our phase 3 clinical trials, we have now reported data on our Covid-19 vaccine from phase 1, 2, and 3 trials involving around 27,000 participants.

He added more importance needs to be given to those who are “Congress at heart”, indicating more commitment to the party’s ideology.The comments assume significance as Gandhi is widely speculated to take charge of the party in June when the organisational elections take place. Party insiders believe that his comments might be a signal that Gandhi’s priorities and even his core team might see more people with stronger ideological binding with Congress’s values.Gandhi, who started his political career in 2004, has earned a reputation for promoting youth in the party by giving them tickets, key portfolios, and responsibilities in the organisation.Also Read | Help raise voice of the weak: Rahul to cadresIn his address to the IYC leaders, he hailed the workers as the party’s “real power”. “Mahatma Gandhi used to say that politics means trust, and today the country needs that trust and belief.”He asked IYC leaders to stay committed to the party’s ideology. Gandhi added that those, who stick to the party, will be rewarded in the long run. He added the Congress cannot shut the door if anyone wants to return to its fold. Gandhi likened Congress to an ocean and added anyone wanting return can be allowed to do so. But he added the positions of power must always go to those who stayed behind and remained committed to the party’s ideology.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/commitment-to-party-ideology-important-rahul-gandhi-to-indian-youth-congress-101615278621279.html
09-03-2021||India||SC puts in abeyance arrest warrant against West Bengal BJP candidate Bharati Ghosh||The Supreme Court on Tuesday directed that the non-bailable arrest warrant against BJP candidate and former IPS officer Bharati Ghosh in connection with the 2019 Lok Sabha polls violence case be kept in abeyance till the conclusion of the assembly polls in West Bengal.Ghosh is contesting from Derba constituency in the state against Trinamool Congress candidate Humayun Kabir, also a former IPS officer.A bench of Justices Ashok Bhushan, S Abdul Nazeer and Hemant Gupta said no further coercive action should be taken against Ghosh in the case. The top court listed the matter for further hearing after two months.During the hearing, senior advocate Nieeraj Kishan Kaul, appearing for Ghosh, said the court had been protecting the highly decorated former IPS officer. However, multiple cases were filed against her after she resigned from West Bengal's ruling TMC, he said.He said the top court had in 2019 protected her against the might of the state by saying she will be interrogated after the conclusion of the Lok Sabha polls.According to Kaul, in one case, she was proceeded against in an alleged assault case along with the CISF officials protecting her, without even taking prior consent.Since 2019, she has been called for questioning in connection with various FIRs lodged against her, he said, adding that even her husband was made accused in one of the cases in which the top court had granted him relief.Kaul sought complete hearing on her plea for quashing of the FIR. In the meantime, he said, she should be protected from any coercive action and be allowed to file her nomination and campaign in the state assembly polls.The bench then asked senior advocate Siddharth Luthra, appearing for the West Bengal government, why the state wanted to arrest her when the apex court had granted her protection in some cases.Luthra said Ghosh had chosen not to appear in one of the cases before the trial court and she should be going there to seek cancelation of the warrant.He said she had never been arrested during the investigation and the coercive process had been issued against her by the court and not the police.The bench observed that she should not be arrested till the election process is over in connection with the FIR lodged in relation to the alleged violence in the last Lok Sabha polls.The top court allowed Ghosh's plea for protection from arrest and said the non-bailable arrest warrant issued against her should be kept in abeyance till the assembly polls end.The former IPS officer had moved the top court on Monday seeking a stay of the arrest warrant and quashing of the FIR lodged against her in connection with the 2019 Lok Sabha polls violence case.She had said in her intervention application that she has been implicated in new cases out of political vendetta despite the top court granting her relief of “no coercive action” in a series of “false cases” lodged against her on February 19, 2019.“Petitioner submits that such FIRs are kept secret as long as possible only to emerge suddenly to harass the applicant/petitioner and to keep her entangled in Court proceedings at every moment and, consequentially, to prevent her from pursuing her political career,” her plea said.Ghosh said she was a BJP candidate from Ghatal Parliamentary constituency in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls and alleged that she was attacked by TMC goons at every polling booth and police remained mute spectators.On February 19, 2019, the top court had provided her relief by granting her protection from arrest in all the cases registered against her.Ghosh, once considered close to West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, claimed the police has registered over dozen FIRs against her, including a case of alleged extortion and illegal exchange of banned notes for gold.The top court had earlier granted her protection from arrest in a case of alleged extortion and illegal exchange of banned notes for gold.The West Bengal government had earlier opposed the plea of Ghosh and said she wants a stay of arrest on a writ petition, which cannot be done.On February 4, 2019, Ghosh joined the BJP in the presence of Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad and senior party leader Kailash Vijayvargiya.Ghosh, who was the West Midnapore Superintendent of Police for more than six years, was transferred as commandant of the third battalion of the state armed police on December 26, 2017. She resigned from service two days later.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-puts-in-abeyance-arrest-warrant-against-west-bengal-bjp-candidate-bharati-ghosh-101615276715836.html

The Congress has alleged that their members were put under pressure to quit the party, a charge rejected by the party rebels.Last week, president municipal council Anantnag, Hilal Shah joined the Apni party along with 21 councillors. Shah and 16 of these councillors had won the local bodies elections in 2018 on a Congress ticket. Hilal Shah had contested several elections as a Congress party member in the past.Apni party president, Altaf Bukhari welcomed him in the party at a function in Srinagar and said it will help make the party strong in south Kashmir, considered a bastion of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP)."My workers took the decision to join the Apni party for the sake of development of our areas, after we met the Apni party leadership, we found that the party is more people friendly than others," said Shah.Shah joined Congress in 2009 and unsuccessfully contested against former chief minister, Mufti Mohammad Sayeed in 2014 assembly elections. "I am a common man; I don’t have any political background. I contested my first election in 2007 as an independent candidate and joined the Congress two years later. My workers are only concerned about the development of Anantnag and nothing else," he added.With Shah’s entry, the Apni party now has a foothold in south Kashmir's urban areas of Anantnag town. Earlier, municipal council president, Baramulla, Omar Azhar Kakroo, who belonged to the family of old Congress loyalists, joined Apni party along with nine councillors. Now, Congress which had 10 members in Baramulla Municipal Council is left with a lone member.Omar Azhar Kakroo said he and his associates left the Congress because of its local leadership. "The party didn’t have any strong leader so we were forced to leave the party." He said there was no pressure on him or others from any quarter to join the Apni party.Also Read: ‘Behave humanely with Rohingyas’, Farooq Abdullah tells CentreApni Party senior leader, Shoaib Lone said that Congress was now a defunct party. "People were leaving the party as its leadership was in disarray and fighting with each other." Lone, a former legislator who resigned from Congress last year, said that for these municipal leaders, the Apni party was the natural choice. "Our party president is accessible and is always aware of the problems of party workers. The councillors who joined our party wanted to work for their people, so they decided to join us."Congress J&K president, Ghulam Ahmad Mir said the party lost control over two municipal councils in Baramulla and Anantnag. "The councillors and presidents were given threats by various agencies and forced to join the Apni party. Very big people intervened and forced our members to join the new party."

Our government has decided that Delhi residents will continuously be provided for free in government hospitals. Soon, per day vaccination capacity will be increased to 60,000 from 45,000,” Sisodia, who also holds the finance portfolio, said while presenting the budget financial year 2021-22 in the Delhi assembly.Private hospitals charge ₹250 for each dose for immunising those over the age of 60 and those between the ages of 45 and 59 with comorbidities. As Sisodia presented a ₹69,000 crore budget, he allocated ₹9934 crore or 14% of the total budget to health."For people to get freedom from Covid-19, a person can go to a private hospital and pay ₹250 and get a vaccine shot. But there are many who have to think about whether they should spend money to get ration for the family or on vaccines. In the 75th year of Independence, this question should not arise in their minds. So, we have decided that vaccines at our hospitals will continue to be given for free to people," he said.Sisodia said the outlay of ₹50 crore has been made under the 'Aam Aadmi Nishulk Covid Vaccine Yojana'. “While taking a lesson from our Covid-19 management, ₹1,293 has been set aside for expansion of healthcare services, including opening of new hospitals, renovating old ones and augmenting beds in them,” he added.On Monday, Sisodia said that Delhi was among the states that conducted the highest number of Covid-19 tests in the country.

09-03-2021||India||DRDO develops AIP technology, Indian subs to be more silent and lethal||A day before INS Karanj attack submarine is inducted into Indian Navy, the Defence Research and Development Organization (DRDO) conducted the final development test of Air Independent Propulsion (AIP) in Mumbai on Monday night, a major step that will make Indian submarines more lethal. AIP allows a submarine to be submerged for longer periods under water and makes the sub-surface platform more deadly by making it quieter than a nuclear submarine.The Indian Navy now plans to retrofit all its Kalvari class non-nuclear attack with AIP during their first upgrade, expected around 2023. The 1615 tonne Kalvari class submarine is being built by Mazagon Dockyards Limited in collaboration with French Naval Group and is based on Scorpene design. INS Karanj, third of the class, is expected to be commissioned tomorrow.The development of AIP technology is a major boost for the Atma Nirbhar Bharat campaign since only the US, France, China, UK and Russia have this key technology. The DRDO’s AIP technology is based on a Phosphoric Acid Fuel Cell and the last two Kalvari class submarines will be powered by it. The AIP design was tested on land in Mumbai on Monday night, the last of a series of tests.Raksha Mantri Shri @rajnathsingh has congratulated @DRDO_India , @indiannavy and the Industry for this significant achievement. https://t.co/4zsFBa8bO5The AIP or marine propulsion technology allows non-nuclear submarines to operate without access to atmospheric oxygen (through snorkel or surfacing) and augments the diesel-electric propulsion system of attack submarines. This means that the AIP fitted submarine does not have to surface for charging its batteries and remains underwater for long periods. The AIP is retrofitted into existing submarine hulls by adding an additional hull section. The AIP equipped submarines are identified as SSP while classic diesel attack submarines carry the SSK classification.While the nuclear submarine generates noise due to the ship’s reactor constantly pumping coolant to maintain temperatures of the engine, the AIP-equipped submarine maintains a lethal silence. The new technology will add to lethality of Indian submarines, which also take advantage of internal refraction in equatorial waters due to differences in temperatures on the surface and within the ocean.The DRDO’s AIP technology has also got a pat in the back from the French, who were in touch with the Indians in the context of Kalvari class manufacturing. Despite urgent requests, the French have decided not to upgrade the Pakistani Agosta 90 B submarines with AIP technology, forcing Islamabad to either go to China or Turkey.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/drdo-develops-technology-that-makes-indian-submarines-quieter-lethal-101615270359062.html

The technology companies depend on it to hire tens of thousands of employees each year from countries like India and China.The H-4 visa is normally issued to those who have already started the process of seeking employment-based lawful permanent resident status in the US.A group of such Indian women over the weekend organised a protest march in San Jose, California on the occasion of International Women’s Day to highlight the suffering of tens of thousands of immigrant women being forced out of their livelihoods, organisers of the event SaveH4EAD said.Spouses of Indian professionals on H-1B visas, mostly women, are the biggest beneficiary of the Obama-era rule that gave employment authorisation cards.“We are here to reiterate that this is our home, this is where we have spent the last many years of our lives, raised families and contributed positively to the society and economy as skilled legal immigrants,” said Pratima Joglekar, California chapter lead volunteer and organiser of the event.The group has sought the Biden administration’s attention to end these arbitrary policies that are disproportionately oppressing women of colour and robbing them of their livelihood.A week after his inauguration on January 20, US President Joe Biden withdrew a Trump-era rule rescinding work authorisation for H-4 visa holders, who are spouses of those possessing H-1B work visas, with majority being highly-skilled Indian women.“My wife’s H-4 renewal is pending for 5 months. We’re going through a very difficult time in paying her residency tuition as she’s not being allowed to work as a Teaching Assistant. I’m the only earning member and it has been extremely stressful for our family,” said Sreenidhi Krishnamoorthy, whose wife is currently a student at San Jose State University.Participants of the march alleged that USCIS has delayed the processing of H-4 and H4EAD ((Employment Authorisation Document) applications excessively, to the point that it is effectively killing the programme.“These delays have led to a serious humanitarian crisis causing havoc in the lives of thousands of skilled legal immigrant women across the US. They’re losing their jobs and health insurances during this pandemic, are unable to renew driver’s license and state ID, unable to travel to their home country or elsewhere, facing grave financial distress, going through severe mental health issues, deep impact on family and kids, among other issues,” a media release said.Many of these are essential workers, healthcare workers, small business owners, researchers, engineers, and more, they said.The Obama era rule to provide work permits to certain categories of spouses of H-1B visas has benefited approximately 100,000 H-4 spouses their basic right to work, be financially independent and contribute positively to the American economy. Over 95 per cent of the H4EAD recipients are highly-skilled women from diverse fields of work, it said.In a statement, SaveH4EAD group attributes the current astronomical processing delays by the USCIS to two main factors: the additional biometric requirements implemented by the previous administration through Executive Order 13780, and the delays due to Covid-related restrictions.The group hoped that the Biden administration will provide immediate relief by removing the additional biometrics requirements since the guiding Executive Order 13780 has already been revoked by President Biden on Day 1, and allowing anyone who has filed for H-4 and H-4 EAD application to use their receipt notice as proof of employment authorisation until USCIS is able to adjudicate the application.The group urged the administration to make it a policy to allow for concurrent processing of H-1B/H-4 applications when filed together, implement premium processing for H-4 and H-4 EAD applications as soon as possible through H.R.8337 - Continuing Appropriations Act, 2021 and Other Extensions Act.They are also seeking auto-extension of H-4 EAD for 180-240 days while the renewal application is pending and codifying H-4 EAD into law as either a stand-alone immigration bill or as part of United States Citizenship Act 2021, or any other smaller immigration bill.As of December 2017, USCIS had approved 1,26,853 applications for employment authorisation for H-4 visa holders. According to a 2018 report by Congressional Research Service (CRS) 93 per cent of approved applications for H-4 employment authorisation were issued to individuals born in India, and 5 were issued to individuals born in China.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/inordinate-delay-in-processing-of-h-4-work-authorisation-say-spouses-of-h-1b-visa-holders-101615269402985.html
09-03-2021||India||Ministries to highlight CVC role while approaching UPSC to discipline officers||The Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) has asked all Union ministries and departments to highlight its role while approaching Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) to seek advice on the quantum of penalty in disciplinary proceedings against Group ‘A’ officers and officers of All India Services. The practice of referring to CVC’s opinion while approaching UPSC had been done away with in December 2012 to avoid “difference of opinion” and “delay due to duality of authority”. The apex vigilance body is consulted at two stages in vigilance cases/disciplinary proceedings, which involves “first-stage advice” on the investigation reports, and “second-stage advice” before a final decision is taken at the conclusion of proceedings. Also Read | UPSC exam: SC says no extra chance for those who exhausted last attempt in 2020The Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT) had issued guidelines in 2011 asking to dispense with “second-stage advice” of CVC in disciplinary cases involving consultation with UPSC. The UPSC is consulted for the quantum of penalty against the concerned officer along with CVC, but the latter had taken a backseat for the past eight years due to DoPT guidelines. However, it was observed that the move didn’t obtain the desired result and there were considerable delays in finalisation of disciplinary proceedings in those cases as well, wherein the proceedings were initiated on the advice of the apex vigilance body. “One of the reasons noticed for delay in such cases is that while approaching UPSC for advice about quantum of penalty on the charged officer concerned, the fact that the disciplinary proceedings were initiated on the advice of CVC in that particular case, is not highlighted by the organisations,” according to a communication sent by CVC on Monday. Therefore, CVC added, it is desired that the authorities concerned, at the time of approaching UPSC for advice, with respect to such cases, “must highlight the fact that particular case was based on the First Stage Advice given by the CVC, so that the cases receives due attention with the authorities in UPSC and its advice is tendered on priority basis”. “It may be done by superscribing the file cover of cases being referred to UPSC with words ‘Vigilance Case’ on a red sticker, similar to process being followed in respect of important files pertaining to urgent/time bound parliamentary matters and Lok Sabha/Rajya Sabha questions etc,” the CVC letter added. According to the CVC annual report 2019, it tendered its advice in 3,157 vigilance cases out of which 2,009 were “first-stage advice” and 453 were “second-stage advice”. Major penalty against officers were recommended in 110 cases out of 453 total cases under “second-stage advice”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ministries-to-highlight-cvc-role-while-approaching-upsc-to-discipline-officers-101615269020751.html

The petition was filed in December last year by Mumbai-based advocate Kashif Ali Khan Deshmukh.The lawyer also included Twitter as a party in his petition and sought directions to the microblogging site to suspend Ranuat's account. It also sought directions to Twitter to bar other social media accounts that spread hatred on its platform.Deshmukh also referred to Ranaut's sister Rangoli Chandel's tweets in the petition where she allegedly suggested genocide of persons belonging to a minority community through her tweet. Khan stated that after Chandel's account was suspended, Ranaut came out in support of her sister through a video wherein she reiterated what Chandel had tweeted.A complaint has already been lodged with Amboli police regarding the video, but no action was taken by the police against the actor, Khan also stated in his petition.The petitioner also highlighted a recent tweet in which the actor has called farmers "terrorists" who are protesting at the Delhi border against the farm laws.Over the last few months, Kangana's tweets on farmers' protest and her colleagues in the film industry have generated controversies. In February, Twitter removed two of her tweets related to farmers' agitation after the social media site found it to be in violation of rules. "We have taken action on Tweets that were in violation of the Twitter Rules in line with our range of enforcement options," Twitter had said in an official statement.She also called Twitter 'China's puppet' following the removal of her tweets. Notably, Twitter is banned in China.Recently, Ranaut hinted at quitting Twitter which is a US-based company and said she might join the 'homegrown' app, Koo.

09-03-2021||India||Time to review 50% cap on quota? Supreme Court asks states||The Supreme Court on Monday said the issue of whether it is time to scrap the 50% ceiling on reservations in educational institutions and jobs needs to be answered in the context of the “changed social dynamics of the society” and recent constitutional amendments, and sought the views of the states — a radical departure from the legal precedent that has, for three decades now, held the ceiling as inviolable.Any attempt to increase the ceiling is loaded with political significance — various states (ruled by governments of varying hues) have sought, in vain until now, to do this to address the grievances of one politically important constituency or other. The court’s observation itself, came in a case where a reservation for Marathas in Maharashtra caused a breach in the ceiling.Almost 30 years after a nine-judge bench in the Indra Sawhney case (famously known as the Mandal Commission case) imposed the ceiling of 50% on total reservation, a five-judge bench agreed to examine whether the 1992 ruling should be reconsidered in the wake of various states providing for quota exceeding 50% and the central government framing a law in 2018 for reservation to economically and socially backward classes.Terming it a matter of “seminal importance”, the five-judge bench, headed by justice Ashok Bhushan, issued notices to all states and sought their views on review of the mandate laid down in the Indra Sawhney case, which ruled that “reservation should not exceed 50%, barring certain extraordinary situations.” Further, the 1992 judgment barred reservation solely on economic criterion.If the five-judge bench accepts that the judgment in Indra Sawhney case should be modified, the case will have to be referred to an 11-judge bench because only a bench of larger composition can modify a previous judgment of the Supreme Court.The court’s move was endorsed by voices from across the political spectrum.Former minister in the Bihar state cabinet and senior Bharatiya Janata Party leader Prem Kumar supported the idea of revisiting the 1992 judgement in “the larger social interest.” Nalin Kohli, national spokesperson of BJP and a Supreme Court lawyer, said: “Being an issue of significance, the apex court has in its wisdom deemed it fit to implead the states as the outcome of the final judgment may have far reaching implications across the country.”The Rashtriya Janata Dal’s chief spokesperson and Bihar MLA Bhai Birendra said that quota should be increased in proportion to the increased share of the backward communities in the population while Janata Dal (United) leader Neeraj Kumar said that the reservation facility should be aimed at improving the socio-economic conditions of the marginalised in keeping with their standing in the caste-based census.Spearheading the demand for Jat reservation in Haryana, Yashpal Malik, national president of the All India Jat Aarakshan Sangharsh Samiti (AIJASS), said: “The Supreme Court hearing will also have a direct impact on long pending demands for Jat reservation under the Other Backward Classes category in Haryana, which has been stayed by the Punjab and Haryana high court.”On Monday, the bench, which also comprised justices L Nageswara Rao, S Abdul Nazeer, Hemant Gupta and S Ravindra Bhat, framed a total of six questions, including the one on review of the 50% ceiling, while considering the constitutional validity of a 2018 Maharashtra law that sought to provide reservation to the Maratha community in jobs and admissions, a move that would take total reservations in the state in excess of 50%. .Based on a report by the Maharashtra State Backward Commission and using the window of “extraordinary situations” in the Indra Sawhney case, the state law provided 16% reservation to the Maratha community in addition to the existing 50% quota. But the Bombay High Court, by its judgment in June 2019, brought down the reservation to 12%in admissions to educational institutions and 13% in jobs.The high court judgment was challenged in the Supreme Court in a clutch of petitions, which said the Maratha quota law should be struck down since it transgressed the judicially-fixed ceiling of 50%. In September 2020, the implementation of the Maratha quota was stayed by the apex court through an interim order after highlighting that the Maharashtra government had breached the 50% ceiling on reservation by its new law.Apart from the issue of total reservation, the five-judge bench has decided to also examine whether the Backward Commission’s report meets the criterion of “extraordinary situations” under the Indra Sawhney ruling in giving quota benefits to the Maratha community.The apex court also agreed to ascertain whether states could add any community in the reservation after the central government’s 102nd constitutional amendment, by which Article 342A was inserted to authorise the President for specifying the “socially and educationally backward classes” (SEBCs) in all states and union territories after consultation with the Governor concerned. This virtually empowered the central government to identify SEBCs even in states and UTs.“Whether, Article 342A of the Constitution abrogates states’ power to legislate or classify in respect of “any backward class of citizens” and thereby affects the federal policy / structure of the Constitution of India?” read one of the questions framed by the bench.On this point, attorney general KK Venugopal, representing the Centre, and senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, appearing for the Maharashtra government, submitted that since interpretation of Article 342A will affect all states, they should also be heard.Agreeing with this, the bench said it will begin hearing all states, starting March 15, and wrap up the arguments, preferably, by March 25.In addition to Maharashtra, there are three other states, Tamil Nadu, Haryana and Chhattisgarh, which have passed similar laws, causing them to exceed the 50% reservation mark. Those decisions are also under challenge in the Supreme Court. Three days ago, the top court said it will take up the challenge to Tamil Nadu’s 69% quota law after deciding the Maratha quota case. The 69% quota in the state pre-dates the Indra Sawhney judgement, one reason why it is extant.The bunch of cases on the Maratha quota was referred to a five-judge bench in September 2020 when the top court also stayed the implementation of the state law in jobs and education. The Maharashtra government later filed an application before the five-judge bench, seeking vacation of the stay on implementation of the quota but the court said that its order would continue until the issues are finally decided.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/time-to-review-50-cap-on-quota-supreme-court-asks-states-101615265491260.html

09-03-2021||India||India condemns one-sided false assertions in UK parliamentary debate over farmers' protest||The High Commission of India in London has condemned false assertions in a "distinctly one-sided discussion" among a group of British parliamentarians on Monday on the issue of peaceful protests and press freedoms in India, amidst the ongoing farmers' stir against three new laws on agricultural reforms.The Indian mission pointed out that foreign media, including British media, had been present and witnessed the events surrounding the farmers' protests in India first-hand and therefore any "question of lack of freedom of the media in India does not arise”."We deeply regret that rather than a balanced debate, false assertions – without substantiation or facts – were made, casting aspersions on the largest functioning democracy in the world and its institutions,” a statement issued by the high commission said, following the debate which stemmed from an e-petition that attracted over 100,000 signatures on the parliamentary website.The mission said it would normally refrain from commenting on an internal discussion involving a small group of honourable parliamentarians in a limited quorum."However, when aspersions are cast on India by anyone, irrespective of their claims of friendship and love for India or domestic political compulsions, there is a need to set the record straight," the statement said.It said that a false narrative over farmers’ protest was sought to be developed even though “the High Commission of India has been, over a period of time, taking care to inform all concerned about the issues raised in the petition.”The statement followed a group of around dozen cross-party British MPs debating issues around the “use of force” against protesters opposed to agricultural reforms in India and journalists being targeted while covering the protests taking place at several border points of Delhi for over 100 days.Farmers, mostly from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, have been camping at several Delhi border points, including Tikri, Singhu and Ghazipur, since November 28, demanding a complete repeal of the three farm laws and a legal guarantee on the minimum support price for their crops.As the UK government minister deputed to respond to the debate, Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) minister Nigel Adams said the close UK-India relationship did not hinder the UK in any way from raising "difficult issues" with India, even as he reiterated the government line that agricultural reforms are a "domestic matter" for India.“This is a time of great ambition for the UK’s relationship with India. Both governments are working to advance shared priorities across trade and investment, health, sustainability and climate change and defence and security,” said Adams.“We are also working with India as a force for good in the UN Security Council and as one of the Prime Minister’s [Boris Johnson] guest countries at the G7 summit later this year in June. This cooperation will help us fix global problems and it will strengthen prosperity and wellbeing in India and the UK," he said."However, whilst this is an exciting time for the UK-India partnership, it does not hinder us from raising difficult issues,” the minister said, adding that “candid discussions” on a range of issues will form part of Boris Johnson’s planned visit to India in the coming months.While the minister acknowledged the “alarm and uncertainty” the farmers’ protests and their coverage in India had caused among British communities with family ties in India, he expressed hope that the ongoing dialogue between the Indian government and farmers’ unions will have positive results.“Both sides need to step back and recognise the need to come to an agreement… I hope the government will commit to helping that cause and offer British skills in a negotiation and compromise to help both sides to bring this issue to a close,” said Virendra Sharma, Opposition Labour MP for Ealing Southall in west London with a large Punjabi diaspora.The debate, held in a hybrid form with some MPs participating via videolink in a room at Portcullis House in London, related to the e-petition entitled “Urge the Indian Government to ensure safety of protesters & press freedom”.“We have only been able to hold the government to account today [Monday] thanks to the power of democracy. A petition started by Liberal Democrat Councillor, Gurch Singh, and signed by over 100,000 people, has forced the government to stop hiding on this important issue," said Layla Moran, Liberal Democrat MP and spokesperson for foreign affairs.From the ruling Conservative Party backbenches, Theresa Villiers noted that agricultural reform is an issue that has proved difficult across the world over the years and pointed out that the new agricultural laws in India had been postponed to allow for greater “consultation and discussion”.“I understand that protesting farmers feel insecure about their future, but Prime Minister Modi’s government has repeatedly said that a core purpose of the reforms is to make farming more profitable, to raise the incomes of people who work in farming and to promote investment in agriculture to increase yields,” she said.“I hear the concerns expressed about the response to the protests, but when thousands and thousands of people are involved in demonstrations and encampments lasting months and months, no policing response can altogether avoid controversial episodes,” she said.The Indian government has denied allegations that it was trying to put an end to the Minimum Support Price (MSP) and the mandi system.Multiple rounds of talks between the government and farmer unions have not been able to resolve the deadlock.India has emphasised that the protests by farmers must be seen in the context of India's democratic ethos and polity and the Ministry of External Affairs said that some vested interest groups have tried to mobilise international support against the country."Before rushing to comment on such matters, we would urge that the facts be ascertained, and a proper understanding of the issues at hand be undertaken," it said last month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-condemns-one-sided-false-assertions-in-uk-parliamentary-debate-over-farmers-protest-101615262295188.html

09-03-2021||India||‘No lesson needed from Amit Shah’: Kerala CM’s retort to home minister||A day after Union home minister Amit Shah levelled serious allegations against Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan in the gold smuggling case, the latter on Monday said he did not need a lesson from Shah and people were well aware of his alleged role in fake encounters and Gujarat riots.Addressing a public meeting in Dharmadam, his assembly constituency in north Kerala’s Kannur district, the CM said the union minister had conveniently forgotten his stature and was busy creating a smokescreen in the state ahead of assembly elections.“I never spent months together in jail. People who make frivolous charges should see their past also,” he said referring to Shah spending time in jail in Sohrabuddin Sheikh and his wife Kausar Bi encounter cases of 2005 in Gujarat. Shah was later acquitted in the case.Vijayan said the home minister insulted the state by making unsavoury and malicious charges and Kerala would not fall for his ‘divisive’ policy.“People are yet to forget about his role in Gujarat riots. A staunch advocate of communal division and hatred, we don’t need any certificate from Shah. If he thinks that Kerala is like a north Indian state, he’s terribly mistaken,” the CM said.In reply to Shah’s questions, asked earlier, about the smuggling scandal, the CM responded with his own questions.“The case surfaced in July. What did the customs do in eight months? How some of the airports have turned into smuggling hub and why central agencies failed to nab real people who are kingpins of the thriving racket?,” he asked. He also criticised minister of state for external affairs V Muraleedharan.Also Read: CVoter opinion poll predicts victories for incumbents, BJP gains in BengalEarlier on Sunday, Shah had said that Vijayan had no moral right to continue in power in the light of recent developments in the smuggling case. The customs had filed an affidavit in the Kerala high court on Friday, citing the confessional statement of main accused Swapna Suresh that dollar (linked to gold smuggling case) was smuggled at the instance of the CM, three ministers and the assembly speaker.Meanwhile, a statement of a woman police officer, who escorted Swapna Suresh during interrogation, came out claiming she had seen the Enforcement Directorate (ED) officials force her to take the CM’s name in the case during the questioning. But the central agency rejected the allegation, calling it her imagination and alleging that she was tutored.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-lesson-needed-from-amit-shah-kerala-cm-s-retort-to-home-minister-101615257702142.html

The officials, however, countered the chief minister's allegations saying officials were present at the spot."The property belongs to railways, it's their responsibility but they were unable to provide map of building. I don't want to do politics over the tragedy but no one from railways has come here," Banerjee said late on Monday night after visiting the high rise building at Kolkata's Strand Road.Also Watch: 9 killed in fire; Mamata Banerjee visits siteHowever, Manoj Joshi, general manager in the Eastern Railway refuted the claim.

09-03-2021||India||Quad, France and UAE join hands in 2 naval exercises to dominate Indo-Pacific||The Indian Navy, its partners in the QUAD grouping, and, its strategic allies France and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) will be part of complex interoperability exercises involving carrier strike groups, anti-submarine warfare aircraft and attack submarines in April– a move aimed at projecting their dominance from the Persian Gulf to the Malacca Straits.The UAE will be joining India and France for the first time in a trilateral naval exercise in the strategically important Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman in late April under the Varuna banner. This is scheduled between April 25 and 27.While dates of the QUAD-plus France naval exercise has to be firmed up on paper, India, the US, Australia, and Japan (the members of QUAD), with France will showcase their naval strength and commitment to freedom of navigation in the Bay of Bengal from April 4 to 7 with missile-guided destroyers, frigates, submarines and surveillance aircraft practising complex manoeuvres under the La Perouse banner.Both La Perouse and Varuna last took place in 2019, but were cancelled due to global pandemic last year. UAE’s naval chief confirmed his country’s participation in the Varuna trilateral exercises.Analysts say Indo-French naval cooperation will further deepen when French navy ships pay a visit to Kochi port in March. This will be followed by La Perouse. Then, in late April, the French Carrier Strike Group led by aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle will enlarge its footprint in the Persian Gulf with an Indian Kolkata-class destroyer and UAE naval forces under the Varuna banner.As India’s sole aircraft carrier INS Vikramaditya is under maintenance after a long deployment arising from India’s stand-off with China in East Ladakh, Indian destroyers, P-8I aircraft and a submarine will participate in the QUAD-plus exercise. During the naval drills, the warships will practise formation sailing, live firing, communications, search, rescue, damage control and personnel transfers. The US is also not sending its aircraft carrier to La Perouse; at least three of its carrier strike groups have been deployed throughout the year in South China Sea and Indo-Pacific.According to a former Indian Navy western commander who asked not to be named, La Perouse shows that the QUAD-plus maritime force can work together anywhere in the Indo-Pacific as there is convergence on shared values, democracy, freedom of navigation and cooperation. The aim of the QUAD-plus navies is to project dominance in the Indo-Pacific from the Gulf of Aden to the north and far Pacific, touching the western coast of US.The political substance to these exercises will be given by the meeting of QUAD leaders in a virtual summit this month followed by the visit of the US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin to India later this month to renew close defence cooperation under the Biden Administration. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expected to meet French President Emmanuel Macron around EU summit in Portugal in May.According to analysts, QUAD-plus’ primary emphasis is a free Indo-Pacific – something that has become increasingly important in light of Beijing’s expansionist plans for the region.After the on-going stand-off with PLA in East Ladakh, the Indian Navy along with its partners including UAE and France has clear objectives in the Indo-Pacific. While the formidable US navy will hold the fort beyond Malacca Straits, the Indian Navy along with its key allies will be first responders in the Indian Ocean. The visit of External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar to Maldives, Seychelles and Mauritius this month was to ensure that Indian navy ships can call in at naval ports in these countries, thereby increasing their range.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/quad-france-and-uae-join-hands-in-2-naval-exercises-to-dominate-indopacific-101615248156836.html

The proposal to set up these committees was mooted by the Tourism Corporation of Gujarat Limited.The order also said that Kailashnathan will head an executive council set up for the purpose, while the physical implementation units would be with the Sabarmati Riverfront Development Corporation and the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation.Reacting to the development, great-grandson of Mahatma Gandhi, Tushar Gandhi, said, “It just means a very diplomatic declaration of taking over the Ashram to do whatever they want to do without any consideration of its soul and history.”He asserted there was nothing new “(in the formation of these committees) in something that has already been decided quietly nearly two years ago and now they are creating a sham of being very transparent about it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/guj-cm-his-aide-in-charge-of-gandhi-ashram-revamp-panel-101615248664058.html

Gandhi also maintained that the Congress can’t shut the door if anyone wants to return to its fold.Congress is like an ocean, Gandhi said in the national executive meeting of the IYC, and if anyone wants to return can be allowed to do so.The Congress leader said that while anyone can come back, the positions of power must always go to those who stayed behind and remained committed to the party ideology.Addressing all the national officials of the Youth Congress, Gandhi hailed the workers as the “real power” of the party and said, “Mahatma Gandhi used to say that politics means trust, and today the country needs that trust and belief.”Gandhi, who is widely speculated to take the charge as the next Congress president in June after the polls are over, had started his organizational career in the Congress as the general secretary in charge of the party’s student and youth wings. His interaction with the young leaders comes at a time when the party is gearing up for the polls and many of these IYC leaders would be actively involved in campaign and other organizational work during the elections.Gandhi also reminded the workers that the duty would be to “raise the voice of every section of the weak” and fight against the “anti-people, ‘Hum Do, Humare Do Wali Sarkar’”. The IYC also passed a resolution that Gandhi should be appointed as the next president of the party.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/help-raise-voice-of-the-weak-rahul-to-cadres-101615245807621.html
09-03-2021||India||PM to visit Bangladesh on March 26||Prime Minister Narendra Modi will make an overnight visit to Bangladesh on March 26 to join celebrations marking the 50th anniversary of the neighbouring country’s independence in 1971, people aware of the matter said on Monday.The two-day trip to Dhaka will be Modi’s first foreign visit in 15 months and will reflect New Delhi’s emphasis on its ties with Bangladesh which the PM has described as “an important pillar” of India’s “Neighbourhood First” policy. Modi last travelled abroad in November 2019 and had to scrap his travel plans over the past year due to the coronavirus pandemic.Modi will be the chief guest at the main event organised by the Sheikh Hasina government to commemorate Sheikh Mujibur Rahman’s declaring the erstwhile East Pakistan as an independent country, Bangladesh, on March 26, 1971. India, which sided with Bangladesh, helped defeat Pakistani forces who eventually surrendered on December 16, 1971.Ahead of the visit, Modi will on Tuesday inaugurate the “Maitri Setu” or friendship bridge between India and Bangladesh over the Feni river via video conference. Hasina is expected to send a recorded video message marking the inauguration of the key bridge that will give Sabroom in Tripura access to Chittagong port in Bangladesh, the people cited above said.Sabroom is located just 80 km from the Bangladesh port and the name of the new bridge symbolises the growing bilateral ties. The 1.9-km bridge was built by the National Highways and Infrastructure Development Corporation at a cost of ₹133 crore.With connectivity emerging as a key component in India-Bangladesh relations, Modi will also launch several other projects to ease the movement of goods and people between the two countries. This includes the laying of the foundation stone for a ₹232-crore integrated check post at Sabroom, which will provide new market opportunities for products from the northeastern states and help in seamless movement of passengers.External affairs minister S Jaishankar, who was in Dhaka last week to prepare for the PM’s visit, described the deepening strategic ties between the two countries as a “360-degree partnership” and stressed that Modi’s visit will surely be a “very memorable” event.The visit comes at a time, Indian officials say, when there is tremendous goodwill for the Indian government and its people in Bangladesh on account of New Delhi going the extra mile to make Covid-19 vaccines available to the neighbouring country.New Delhi has supplied nine million doses of the vaccine to Dhaka, including two million as a gift from the people of India. The remaining seven million doses were sent on a commercial basis after Bangladesh decided to rely on Indian vaccines rather than those pushed by Beijing.“India has kept the promise that it had made,” a senior government official said, a reference to Modi’s assurance to Hasina during their virtual summit in December. Modi had assured her that the doses would be made available to Bangladesh as and when India produced them, and also offered a partnership in vaccine production. It was at this summit that Hasina declared that “India is our true friend”.Officials said it was on account of New Delhi delivering on its commitment that Jaishankar returned from Dhaka last week with the sense that Bangladesh’s opposition parties, which are often critical or suspicious of India, had appreciated the move on vaccines.There are no big-ticket agreements planned during the PM’s visit. The two countries signed seven agreements in areas ranging from hydrocarbons to agriculture at the Modi-Hasina summit in December.India and Japan are also looking to take up more joint development projects in Bangladesh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-to-visit-b-desh-on-march-26-101615244464852.html
09-03-2021||India||Rising fuel prices rock Parliament||Spiraling fuel prices under the Narendra Modi government rocked both Houses of Parliament when it resumed for the second half of the budget session on Monday. The Congress and other Opposition parties launched protests, demanding a debate on the issue and forcing frequent adjournments.Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge, who debuted as the Leader of Opposition in the Rajya Sabha, said, “Throughout the country, people are agitating. That is why, we are requesting you to suspend all the rules and give us a chance to speak. Ultimately, we will see what the Government is going to say on this subject. There is a rise of nearly 820 % excise duty on diesel and around 258 % excise duty on petrol after 2014.”The original plan was to have women MPs run the two Houses and for women-related issues to get priority in the proceedings to mark the International Women’s Day in Parliament. However, the protests and frequent disruptions partially derailed the plan.Leader of the opposition Mallikarjun Kharge gave a notice under rule 267 to not take up listed business for the day and instead discuss the issue of a hike in petrol, diesel and cooking gas prices. Rajya Sabha chairperson M Venkaiah Naidu said the issue could be taken up for discussion during the discussion on the appropriation bill. Kharge however did not relent, and the opposition kept raising slogans in the house. The house was first adjourned till 11 AM and for a second time till 1 PM after the opposition continued to push for its demand. The Opposition, which has been vocal about the fuel price rise, launched protests in both Houses.Congress leader Adhir Chowdhury accused the government of diverting attention from the issue of petroleum prices and said in the Lok Sabha, “On Women’s Day, we must discuss the way the price of petrol and diesel has increased.” Chowdhury also demanded that the government must introduce women reservation bill and pass it.On Monday, several party leaders also requested Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla and Rajya Sabha chairman Venkaiah Naidu to curtail the session as many MPs are engaged in the election campaign in Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Kerala, Assam and Puducherry. With an eye on this, both Houses will return to the old schedule of working from 11 am to 6 PM from Tuesday. Both Naidu and Birla announced the change of timetable in the Houses.Under protocol put in place on account of Covid, the Rajya Sabha was working from 9 am to 2 pm and the Lok Sabha from 4 pm to 10 pm. Given the low attendance, the thinking in Parliament is that both houses can be conducted simultaneously.Senior officials said that the current 6 feet distance between the seats of MPs would be reduced to 3 feet to accommodate more MPs in the House. “Out of 238 MPs of Rajya Sabha, 180 members will sit in the chamber while others will be accommodated in the gallery. Similar arrangement would be made in the Lok Sabha as well,” a senior official said. Many women MPs, including Harsimrat Kaur Badal of SAD, also protested against the high prices of fuel.Meanwhile, Rajya Sabha chairperson M Venkaiah Naidu on Monday said the low attendance of members of non-BJP and non-Congress parties in the meetings held for scrutiny of Demands for Grants was an area of concern. He said the attendance of other parties and groups had fallen to 27.60% from 40% last year. “The overall attendance in the 21 meetings this year has fallen to 42% from 48% last year,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rising-fuel-prices-rock-parliament-101615244131734.html
09-03-2021||India||Batla House: Ariz Khan held guilty of killing inspector||A Delhi court on Monday held alleged Indian Mujahideen terrorist Ariz Khan guilty along with his accomplices of killing inspector Mohan Chand Sharma of the special cell in the Batla House encounter that took place in the national capital in September 2008. The court will hear arguments on the quantum of sentence on March 15.Additional sessions judge Sandeep Yadav convicted 35-year-old Khan, also known as Junaid, Salim and Anna, saying that he and his associates “intentionally” and “knowingly” committed the murder of inspector Mohan Chand Sharma of the special cell by a firearm on September 19, 2008 in furtherance of a common intention.“It has also been proved on record that on the aforesaid date, time and place accused Ariz Khan @ Junaid along with his associates... in furtherance of common intention of all of them fired gunshot on deceased Mohan Chand Sharma and his team, they all being public servant...” the court said.It held Khan guilty of murder, attempt to murder, obstructing a public servant on duty, causing grievous hurt and non-appearance despite being declared a proclaimed offender (PO). Khan was pronounced a PO in 2009 and later arrested after being on the run for 10 years.The court said in a 105-page judgment that the evidence produced by the prosecution duly proved its case beyond reasonable doubt. It said Khan and his associates “voluntarily” obstructed inspector Mohan Chand Sharma and his team in discharge of their public functions.Senior public prosecutor AT Ansari said the prosecution produced 100 witnesses to substantiate the charges framed against the accused and every type of evidence, including the recovery of documents, photographs and educational papers, was taken into account.“Keeping in mind the holistic view of the matter coupled with the gravity and manner of commission of the offences, I will certainly demand death sentence for the accused,” he said.The judge noted that there was contemporaneous recovery of incriminating articles such as photographs, educational certificates pertaining to the accused from the place of occurrence. If these articles were falsely planted, the accused had to tell where from the police got those articles, he said.The shootout took place six days after five serial blasts occurred in Delhi on 13 September 2008 in which at least 30 people were killed and over 100 injured. Inspector Sharma of the special cell had got a specific tip-off about the terrorist involved in the blasts hiding in a specific flat in Batla House, Jamia Nagar.Sharma with his raiding team of officers reached the spot where a shootout broke out. While Sharma and other police officials sustained injuries, two terrorists -- Mohammad Atif Ameen and Mohammad Sajid -- were killed. Sharma succumbed to his injuries later.Ariz Khan and Shahzad Ahmad managed to flee the spot but were later nabbed by police. While Ahmad, arrested on Jan 1, 2010, was sentenced to life imprisonment in the case in July 2013, Khan was arrested on February 14, 2018 from the Indo-Nepal border and convicted on Monday.On Monday, ASJ Yadav said Khan, along with his associates assaulted and used criminal force on Sharma and his team with the intent to prevent or deter them from discharging their duty.MS Khan, counsel for the accused, said he would appeal the vedict as it was not ascertained as to who shot the bullet that killed Sharma.“It is still a mystery and even a medical board has not been able to ascertain as to who shot the bullet that killed Sharma. Besides, the testimonies of the police officers, there is no evidence on the occupancy of the flat or the escape from the said premises. Even the alleged recovery of my client’s wallet from the flat is doubtful as the IO of the case was not even informed about it,” he said.The court asked the investigating officer to conduct an inquiry to ascertain Khan and his family’s financial condition and assess their capacity to pay compensation. The judge said the enquiry would focus on the impact of the crime on the legal heirs/dependents of Sharma so that it can arrive at a just conclusion on the question of compensation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/batla-house-ariz-khan-held-guilty-of-killing-inspector-101615240261558.html
09-03-2021||India||Govt building ‘agri stack’ to give unique ID to every Indian farmer||The Centre is in the process of creating for the first time a “digital agri-stack”, a hi-tech national farmers’ database that could give the government and agribusinesses unprecedented insights into the rural economy, people with knowledge of the matter said.The digital repository will aid precise targeting of subsidies, services and policies, the officials added. Under the programme, each farmer of the country will get what is being called an FID, or a farmers’ ID, linked to land records to uniquely identify them. India has 140 million operational farm-land holdings.Alongside, the government is also developing a unified farmer service platform that will help digitise agricultural services delivery by the public and private sectors, officials said. “The data of 4.3 crore (43 million) farmers linked with land records have already been verified and the database will be unveiled shortly,” one of officials said on condition of anonymity.The database will connect seemingly simple data points: the number of occupational farmers who avail of subsidies, how much land they own, what they grow and which agro-climatic zones they fall in. “These data points will be triangulated by a software that will throw up a far more complex but illuminating picture of the rural and agricultural economy,” the official said. The next step would be to create a model to monetise the data, the official added.The database uses Aadhaar-based data generated from key farm sector programmes such as PM-KISAN, a cash-transfer scheme and is being built under the National e-Governance Plan in Agriculture, a programme launched in the fiscal 2010-11.“We have a longstanding problem of accurate farm-economy data. We mostly depend on periodic surveys and the agriculture census. Real-time data will connect farmers and service providers in real-time,” said Ravi Saran, the CEO of Upajak, an Indore-based farmer producer organisation.The Centre’s Committee on Doubling Farmers’ Income has recommended boosting digital initiatives in the farm sector with tools such as remote-sensing, geographical information system, data analytics, cloud computing and drones. A second official said the centralised farmers’ database will be used to better target subsidies, including fertilisers, cheap crop insurance and dissemination of mobile-based crop advisories.Farm subsidies worth thousands of crores — including cheap insurance, fertilisers, credit and income transfers — still suffer from leakages because very little information about individual farmers is centrally available. For instance, although the government knows India’s annual fertiliser demand, it has no way of knowing how much fertiliser an individual farmer may actually need, which may vary widely, depending on crops and soil conditions.There is currently no limit on the number of subsidised fertilisers each farmer can buy. “So, somebody who actually needs five bags of urea may be buying 10 bags and diverting the rest to open markets,” the second official said. The Centre spends approximately ₹75,000 crore annually on fertiliser subsidy. The government plans to eventually implement “cash transfers” in place of fertiliser subsidy.According to MicroSave Consulting, which audited the fertiliser subsidy programme for the state-run think tank Niti Aayog, such cash transfers are likely to face hurdles of “accurate targeting”. Its report pointed to the need for a farmers’ database. An Aadhaar-enabled database that maps actual farm sizes, cropping patterns and agro-climatic zones can create district-level data points to save leakages of aid, the official added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/national-farmers-database-on-anvil-101615237499226.html
09-03-2021||India||Prominent warnings at IGI against carrying bullets soon||Delhi police have written to all Indian air carriers operating from Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International airport as well as to Delhi airport operator DIAL asking them to mention prominently on all boarding passes, air tickets and at terminal entry points that carrying ammunitions is a non-bailable offence and can land flyers in jail.The letter by the police came in the backdrop of 522 passengers being arrested from Delhi airport in the past five years for carrying live ammunition in their bags.Police data shows that some of the 522 passengers nabbed while carrying live bullets in their bags claimed that they had done so unknowingly. Senior officers said that since the offence was a non-bailable one, all these passengers had to be placed under arrest. While in some cases, as per a 2014 Supreme Court judgment, bail can be granted from the police station on selective grounds, the majority of passengers have to get themselves bailed out from court.The process may usually take a day or two, they said.Data shows that while last year due to the closure of air traffic, the number of passengers nabbed with live ammunition was limited to just 66, in 2019, a total of at least 107 passengers had been arrested for the same offence. In 2018, 135 passengers had been arrested for carrying live bullets in their bags.This year, till February 15, at least 16 passengers had been arrested for the offence.At present, the rear side of boarding passes do come printed with a warning that states that ammunitions were a prohibited item. In its letter to the airlines, the Delhi police have now written, “It is advised to all airlines operating at Indira Gandhi International airport to specifically mention on the front side of the tickets/boarding passes in bold letters asking passengers to ”re-check your luggage as carrying ammunition at the airport is a punishable offence and a criminal case shall be registered against the violators in which he/she can land up in jail.”The letter further says that an SMS may also be sent to passengers regarding the same after they purchase a ticket. The police have also requested the airport operator to clearly display such warnings and advisory prominently at the terminal building’s entry points.Deputy commissioner of police (Delhi airport) Rajeev Ranjan said in most such cases, it has been noticed that passengers ended up carrying the ammunitions inadvertently. “But because they are not carrying a valid licence, as per the law, we need to file an FIR (first information report) against them under the Arms Act and they have to face criminal proceedings in a court of law,” Ranjan said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/prominent-warnings-at-igi-against-carrying-bullets-soon-101615237168050.html
09-03-2021||India||Is the Haryana Act legal?||Haryana government’s new law to reserve 75% of private sector jobs in the state, paying Rs.50,000 or less a month, for local candidates, has triggered a controversy. But is the Haryana State Employment of Local Candidates Act, 2021 legal?What are the provisions in the Constitution that enable reservation/quota?Article 14 guarantees equality and equal protection of law to all. Articles 15 (1) and 15 (2) prohibit the State from discriminating any citizen on ground of religion, race, caste, sex, or place of birth. But clauses (3) to (5) of Article 15 empower the State to positively discriminate in favour of the grossly underrepresented and neglected sections of the society in order to promote substantive equality. Article 15(3) empowers the State to make special provisions for women and children while Article 15(4) authorises the State to make special provisions for advancement of socially and educationally backward sections or SC/STs. Article 15(5) goes one step further and says the State can make reservation in admission to education institutions, whether or not aided by government.Similarly, Articles 16 (1) and 16(2) lay down that the State cannot discriminate against citizens in the matters of employment.However, clause 3 of Article 16 allows Parliament to enact a law with residence qualifications necessary for government jobs, thus introducing the domicile-based preferential treatment. Article 16(4) also allows the State to make reservation for any backward class of citizens, which in the opinion of the state is not adequately represented in services. This opens door for reservations for Other Backward Classes (OBCs). Article 16(4A) was incorporated permitting reservation in promotions but restricting the same to Scheduled Caste (SC) and Scheduled Tribes (ST).After the Constitution (103rd Amendment) Act, 2019, clauses 6 and Articles 15 and 16 were inserted to provide for a further 10% reservation in jobs and educational institutions to economically backward sections in the general category.Can courts direct the State to provide reservation to SC/ST or backward classes?No. It has been held in a body of judgments of the Supreme Court that directions cannot be issued to the State to give reservation to any class of citizens.Starting 1963, several rulings have emphasised that Articles 15(4) and 16(4) are enabling provisions and do not confer any right on SC/STs, OBCs or any other group of citizens to demand reservation as a matter of right, and thus, no such directive can be issued to the State by the courts.In MR Balaji Vs State of Mysore, 1963, for instance a five-judge bench underscored: “It is necessary to emphasise that Article 15(4) like Article 16(4) is an enabling provision....” This judgement also held that caste cannot be the sole and dominant test for determining social backwardness and that reservations made under Article 15(4) should be reasonable and less than 50%. These judgments drive home the point that although the State has been given the authority to provide for reservation, such decisions are amenable to judicial review.Can a law be framed for reservation on domicile?Yes, but only by the Parliament. Article 16(3) in the Constitution empowers Parliament to provide for domicile-based reservation in public employment and jobs with local or any other authority under a state or a Union Territory.Exercising this power, in 1957, the Centre passed The Public Employment (Requirement as To Residence) Act to repeal all existing laws in a state or a Union Territory that prescribed requirements as to residence (domicile) for public employment. The Centre, however, reserved its right to lay down rules in respect of certain classes of public employment in certain areas of some states such as Manipur, Tripura, Andhra Pradesh and Himachal Pradesh. But this power with the Central government is also not unfettered, as was made clear by a judgment of the Supreme Court in 1969 when a constitution bench of the Supreme Court in AVS Narasimha Rao Vs State of AP declared that the law enacted by Parliament under Article 16 (3), making a special provision for domicile within the Telangana region of the State of Andhra Pradesh for the purpose of public employment, was ultra vires (without power under) the Constitution. It ruled that even Parliament cannot use the power under Article 16(3) to provide for domicile-based reservation in a particular part of the state and that the entire state must be the venue for residential qualification.Do state governments have any specific power to make laws/policies for domicile-based reservation?No. When the reservations of certain percentage of seats in medical colleges in favour of candidates from rural areas was sought to be justified on economic considerations, a three-judge bench of the Supreme Court, in State of Uttar Pradesh Vs Pradip Tandon (1974) emphatically rejected the plea. In Dr Pradeep Jain Vs Union of India, 1984, the top court dealt specifically with the issue of domicile-based reservation, noting that to regard an individual from one state as an outsider in another state “would be to deny him his constitutional rights and to derecognise the essential unity and integrity of the country by treating it as if it were a mere conglomeration of independent States.”Can a state make it legally contingent for a private sector firm to reserve jobs for local residents?The Act mandates all private establishments in Haryana to provide 75% of new jobs to local candidates. Under Article 19(1)(g), all citizens have a fundamental right to practice any profession, or to carry on any occupation, trade or business as a fundamental right. By mandating private institutions to employ a certain set of candidates, the Act constricts their right to carry on their occupation freely, which will be a major basis of challenges to the law.The 93rd Constitutional Amendment Act was passed in 2005 to allow the State to make provisions for the advancement of socially and educationally backward class of citizens or SC/ST in matters relating to admission in private educational institutions.But this does not give power to the State to make such provisions for employment in private institutions . Private firms will likely claim that the law effectively interferes with their constitutional rights to carry on their trade freely, especially when they do not receive any sops from the government and the law also fails on constitutional touchstone.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/is-the-haryana-act-legal-101615236355738.html
09-03-2021||India||Why reservation may fail in levelling the field||A Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court has agreed to re-examine the 50% ceiling on reservations in India, which was put in place by the Supreme Court itself in 1992 in the famous Indra Sawhney case. The apex court took this decision while hearing a case on the validity of 10% separate reservations for Marathas in education and employment in government jobs in Maharashtra, something that would have breached the ceiling. Reservations were originally envisaged in the constitution as a temporary provision only for social groups designated as Scheduled Caste (SC) and Scheduled Tribe (ST). Over time they have come to occupy a more prominent role in politics, paved the way for not just evergreening such provisions but also expanding their coverage. From applying to just SC-ST social groups, reservations have expanded to cover OBCs, economically weaker sections of all social groups, who are neither SC-ST nor OBCs, and increasingly, once dominant communities that have now fallen on hard times (such as land-owning communities dependent on agriculture). While the argument in asking for a 50% cap on reservations can be questioned on the basis that merit itself is sometimes the function of privilege, it is clear that reservations are gradually losing their ability to level the playing field. Here are three charts which explain this.Reservations apply to the public sector, which is losing its importanceWhile the scope of reservations has gradually increased in India from being for just SC-ST groups to first OBC and now economically weaker sections from other social groups as well, the size of the pie which is covered under reservations has been declining gradually. Data from the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy’s database shows that the share of public sector; where reservations apply, in organised employment in the country increased until the 1980s and then started declining as public sector started shrinking with the opening up of the economy. In 2011-12, the latest period for which data is available, public sector accounted for less than 60% of total organised sector jobs in the country. This includes government jobs. (Chart 1)Private sector has higher social-inequality in better paying jobsAn analysis of unit level data from the latest Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS), India’s official source of employment statistics, shows that caste-wise inequality in salaried jobs (they are the highest paying jobs in India) is greater in private sector than in public sector. The former does not have reservations, while the latter has. A 2007 Economic and Political Weekly (EPW) paper by SK Thorat and Paul Attewell was based on an experiment where identical job applications were sent by candidates with names which suggested that they were upper caste, Dalits (SC) and Muslims. The authors found that companies discriminated against candidates with SC and Muslim surnames even in terms of contacting candidates. But reservations may not be the answer. (Chart 2)Expanding reservations to private sector will not solve inequality problemThe declining share of India’s public sector employment should be read in consonance with the fact that the total number of organised sector jobs in 2011-12 was just 29.6 million, whereas the size of India’s labour force was 430 million. This statistic is the most telling reminder that even if reservations were to be expanded to the private sector, it cannot achieve much in equalizing access to quality jobs, even if the social unrest which the policy would cause, were to be set aside for a moment. A comparison of the share of salaried jobs in India during the post-reform period captures this point. The solution lies in increasing the size of the pie, not play around with the allocation of the slices.(Chart 3)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/why-reservation-may-fail-in-levelling-the-field-101615234934723.html
09-03-2021||India||Separated from families, uncertainty looms over deportation in Rohingya settlements||The family members of the 169 Rohingya community members who were taken to a detention centre at a prison in Jammu have now been confined to their settlement clusters in the city’s Kathua district, where many described a sense of dread since the detentions and repeated appeals to the government of India not to deport them to Myanmar.Over the weekend, police rounded up the 169 people from the city and took them to the Hiranagar jail detention centre, which officials said received more refugees recently from other districts of the union territory, such as Sambha. “We appeal Indian government not to detain us. Only we know what we survived back home in Burma and how we reached here. Our parents have been killed. Even policemen are fleeing Burma now,” said Mohammad Shahzahan (27), who came to Jammu after felling what the United Nations has described as ethnic cleansing in Myanmar.Rohingyas are a community of Muslims speaking the Bengali dialect. Since the early 1990s, more than a million of them have fled Myanmar following waves of violence. Myanmar at present is going through a new wave of strife after the military displaced the government in a coup. Dozens of anti-coup protesters have since been killed.Shahzahan, speaking from the refugee settlement cluster in Kiryani Talab in Narwal area, said that he and other Rohingya would happily go back to their country once peace returned. “But please do not treat us like militants. If our days are over here, then send us to any other country,” he added. Access to the settlement has been cut off by policemen who now guard a main access gate and a nearby Madarsa. Several of the family members left behind after the 169 people were taken include children, some as young as 2.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/separated-from-families-uncertainty-looms-over-deportation-in-rohingya-settlements-101615233500105.html
09-03-2021||India||Record GST collections expected in March, set to hit ₹1.30 lakh crore||India’s Goods and Services Tax (GST) collection in March 2021 is expected to touch a record high of around Rs.1.30 lakh crore on the backdrop of a rapid economic recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic and a hard lockdown necessitated by it, two people aware of the development said.The people, who asked not to be named, attributed the enhanced collections also to stricter compliance through e-invoicing, which had made it difficult to evade tax.The revenue in March may cross the record Rs.1,19,875 crore collected in January by at least Rs.10,000 crore, the people said.The recovery in GST collections reflects the larger revival in the economy. India’s economy shrank by 24.4% in the three months ended June 30 and 7.3% in the three months ended October, before entering growth territory and expanding by 0.4% in the three months ended December 31. The government has estimated the entire year’s GDP contraction at 8%, although many experts expect it to do better.After remaining in contraction mode for six months in a row, since March 2020 — India imposed a 68-day-long hard lockdown in late March — GST collections started growing from September 2020. GST collections, which plunged to an all-time low at Rs.32,172 crore in April 2020, touched a record Rs.1,19,875 crore in January. The latest GST collection figure was Rs.1,13,143 crore for February 2021, a 7.3% year-on-year growth.Pratik Jain, partner and leader, Indirect Tax, PwC India, said: “GST collections are on an upsurge in last four-five months even without raising GST rates. This is because of tightening of compliances, increased rigours in audit /investigation and leveraging technology to widen the tax base. Besides, economy is recovering fast and that would also be reflected in the March collections.”The compulsory e-invoicing system that started in January this year has plugged business-to-business (B2B) tax evasion to a great extent as transactions above Rs.100 crore are mostly B2B, where correct invoicing is insisted upon by both buyers and sellers to avail input tax credits and avoid penalties, one of the two people cited above said.“Thus, increased use of technology has helped to ease compliance burden on the one hand and raised fear among unscrupulous elements on the other,” he added.The government made e-invoicing mandatory for businesses with an annual turnover of Rs.100 crore and above from January 1. The idea is to progressively make it compulsory for all.The second person added that no significant B2B transaction is now possible below the GST radar as e-invoices require QR codes, which are generated from the GST Network (GSTN). “GSTN has an instant record of all transactions,” he added.“There are two more reasons for the optimism that GST collections could cross Rs.1.30 lakh crore in March. One is the fiscal year closing on March 31, and the other is a temporary freeze on refunds.”The tax department usually goes slow on refunds towards the end of the financial year to make it easier to close books, this person explained.The two people said the higher GST collection in March is expected despite February being a smaller month. Official GST collection data comes with a lag because the last date for paying GST is the 20th day of the following month. Therefore, the March GST collection figure actually reflects business activities in February.MS Mani, partner at Deloitte India, said: “Despite the fewer number of working days in February and although the services sector continues to operate with restrictions, the GST collections for February [officially March figures] are expected to be robust due to the continued growth in GDP [gross domestic product] and the anti-evasion drive undertaken by the authorities.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/record-gst-collections-expected-in-march-101615226194453.html

It’s expected to submit its report with the Visitor and the ministry of education by Tuesday when Tyagi’s term is ending officially.”When asked if Tyagi will have to vacate his residence allocated at the university campus, the official said, “As per the norms, he will be given six months’ time, starting from the day of his retirement, to vacate the residence.”Tyagi was suspended by the union ministry of education in October, after the Centre had pointed out several shortcomings in the functioning of the university in his tenure.The suspension was followed by a high-voltage drama when a faction led by Tyagi — who was on medical leave since July — overrode the recommendations of the executive council to appoint a new registrar and a new pro-V-C. The President of India nullified all orders and appointments made by Tyagi.DU officials said that Tyagi was the first V-C in the university’s 100-year history to be suspended.Shri Ram Oberoi, former president of Delhi University Teachers’ Association (DUTA) and a member of the DU court, said, “It’s unprecedented in the history of Delhi University. In 1969, three teachers were suspended by the governing body of Shyamlal College. The DU teachers’ association, at the time, launched a big movement and brought an amendment to DU’s ordinances. It was decided that no teacher would be suspended without prior approval of the V-C. But who will give the approval when the V-C is suspended?” he said.Oberoi said that DU’s ordinance has no provision to suspend a V-C.JL Gupta, a member of Delhi University’s executive council, backed the statement.“The DU ordinance doesn’t permit suspension of a V-C and that’s why this has never happened before,” he said.However, the University administration did not receive any communication from the office of the Visitor till Monday evening. DU registrar Vikas Gupta said, “We have not received anything from the Visitor or the ministry. We, in fact, are not aware of Tyagi’s letter to the Visitor. We got to know about it only through media reports.”Despite several attempts, Tyagi did not respond to calls and texts seeking comment. Last week, Tyagi wrote to the Visitor requesting that his suspension be resolved.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/report-on-probe-against-du-v-c-tyagi-likely-today-101615232762662.html

Congress leaders opposed the bill and called it a violation of constitutional rights. Now, the bill will be sent to governor Anandiben Patel for approval.BJP MLAs supported the bill and called it a gift for women on the occasion of Women’s Day. Party MLA Sitasharam Sharma said, “According to a 1956 report, conversions are mostly brought about under influence, misrepresentation, etc, or in other words not by conviction but by various inducements offered for proselytisation in various forms... Congress leaders believe in doing politics and the BJP believes in resolving the root cause of such issues.”Members of the minority Muslim and Christian communities said they will move court after the notification of the law.Muslim Vikas Parishad state convener Mahir Khan said, “This bill will be misused by people to target us and we will not keep silent over this. We will move court against it.”In the assembly, former minister and Congress MLA Govind Singh said, “I opposed this bill because it has been brought to suppress, harass and create a fearful environment for people from a minority...The new bill is a violation of Article 21 and Article 25 of the Constitution of India.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mp-assembly-nod-to-anti-conversion-bill-101615232453627.html

The technology requires telecoms companies to scrub messages to verify if the text being sent has been approved and it is only being sent to someone who has consented to receive such a message. According to BloombergQuint, which cited unnamed industry officials, several banks may not have complied with the requirements fully to get their communications vetted under the new blockchain-based system. It also cited other unnamed officials as saying that in the case of one prominent private bank, only 25-30% of the OTPs were being delivered.

Throughout the day, women protesters organised marches at the sites while wearing yellow and green scarves and holding the flags of various farmer union groups.Kavita Kurugunti, member of Samyukta Kisan Morcha – an umbrella body comprising 40 farmer groups – said the protests on Monday were entirely managed by women. “Women arrived at the borders in tractors, cars, jeeps, tempo, buses and trains, waving mazdoor kisan flags, to protest against the three agricultural laws,” she said.From manning the stage to addressing the crowd, arrangements related to the agitation were carried out by women of all ages and professions at Singhu, Tikri, and Ghazipur.Harpreet Kaur, 35, a farmer from Doaba in Punjab, said, “So many women have lost their family members during this three-month agitation. We have all come here so that the government takes note of our losses and scraps the new farm laws.”At Tikri, women farmers dubbed the three laws “death warrants”. “Women farmers termed the Modi government anti-women and said demands of women farmers have been completely ignored by the government,” Kurugunti said, adding that women farmers constitute a major part of the agricultural workforce in the country.“The government feels that the movement will weaken over time, but the resolve of farmers is getting stronger by the day,” farmer leader Harinder Bindu said, reiterating that farmers won’t leave Delhi’s borders unless the three farm laws are repealed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/thousands-of-women-farmers-joined-the-ongoing-farmer-agitation-at-delhi-s-border-101615230030163.html
09-03-2021||India||Activists flag concerns over debris dumping on Yamuna floodplains||Environmental activists and some slum dwellers have raised concerns over mounds of construction debris and soil excavated during the construction of the new Parliament Building at Sansad Marg — as part of the Central Vista redevelopment project — being dumped on the Yamuna floodplains in east Delhi.Environment activists alleged that the Central Public Works Department (CPWD), which is undertaking the construction of the new Parliament building via private developers, has been allowing the dumping of construction waste — including debris and soil from the excavation of the site on the floodplains — in violation of an order of the National Green Tribunal (NGT). Anyone who is found violating the order is liable to pay an environmental compensation charge of up to ₹50,000 under the “polluter pays” principle.CPWD, however, strongly denied the allegations saying that the portion of land in question is “away from the floodplain”, and that on the request of the Public Works Department, it was just levelling the earth below the Barapullah road project site.On Monday, Hindustan Times visited the portion of the Yamuna floodplains adjacent to the Noida Link Road — ranging up to the Delhi-Noida-Direct Flyway till the Meerut Expressway and the Vikas Bridge — and found that the area was filled with mounds of soil and concrete waste, which had reached the height of the main road. Even though activists and the slum dwellers in the area said that this waste was being dumped late at night from the site of the new Parliament building, HT could not verify this claim.Large pieces of cement blocks, building material and rocks were also piled up on the stretch.Dev Pal, a field researcher at a citizens’ group called Housing and Land Rights Network, who had first noticed the violation, said that all the waste that was seen on the floodplains happened after February 4.“There are around two dozen huts situated on this portion of the floodplains and this dumping is happening all around those dwellings. From February 4, every night around 50-70 trucks line on the main road and dump the waste here. The mounds have become so high now that it has reached the height of the main road. This is an eco-sensitive zone and if we receive a good rainfall tomorrow, then all of these houses around these mounds will get buried in the soil,” Pal said.Pal alleged that the dumping on this portion was from the site of the new Parliament building.“We have been tracking and researching the movement of trucks and we have found that such a high volume of waste is coming only from the Parliament building site. We had reached out to the Delhi Development Authority (DDA), but we got a standard response from them that the matter is being looked into,” he said.Responding to HT on Monday, CPWD denied all allegations that the waste from the Central Vista construction site was being dumped on the floodplains. “These allegations are not correct. We have filled excavated earth on PWD’s (Public Works Department) Barapullah project, within the clover leaves and slip road area. This part is away from the floodplains,” CPWD said.Delhi Development Authority (DDA), the agency that owns the floodplain, in its response said that the complaint was brought to their notice on Monday morning and officials are “looking into the matter”.Environmentalists, however, insisted that the area under question was part of the floodplains and in 2010 and 2013, when the levels of Yamuna had increased and was nearing the ‘danger’ mark, this section had to be evacuated as the water from the river had reached the edge of the Noida Link Road.Manoj Misra, the convener of Yamuna Jiye Abhiyaan, said that the area where waste is being dumped was originally a low-lying area and is a natural wetland, which helps in the recharge of groundwater, and is a habitat for many animals and birds apart from being home to several local farmers.“This dumping needs to be stopped. This area should be cleared and reclaimed as ordered in 2013 by the NGT,” Misra said.He also said that if immediate action is not initiated, it will lead to an eventual alteration of the morphology of the floodplains.Bhim Singh Rawat, associate coordinator at the South Asia Network on Dams, Rivers, People (SANDRP), said that over the last few years such rampant construction around the Yamuna has led to several such violations.“The problem is that they do not realise that they are creating trouble for themselves. Every river follows a decadal flooding cycle, which means that every few decades, the river water rises to dangerous levels and if there are any encroachments in its flow, they get washed away. Over the years such violations also result in alterations in the flow pattern of the river,” Rawat said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/activists-flag-concerns-over-debris-dumping-on-yamuna-floodplains-101615229636311.html
09-03-2021||India||9 killed in blaze at multi-storeyed building in Kolkata||Nine people including four fire fighters, one Railway Protection Force personnel, an assistant sub-inspector of the Kolkata Police and one unidentified person died while fighting a massive blaze the fire at a high rise building that houses the offices of the Eastern Railway at Kolkata's Strand Road, fire service minister Sujit Bose said late Monday night.Two more bodies were found inside a second elevator, fire brigade officials said late on Monday night. The bodies could not be identified. It was suspected that one of them could be the Eastern Railway's deputy chief commercial manager Partha Sarathi Mondal who had been missing since evening."The police commissioner told me that two more people are missing and may have died," said chief minister Mamata Banerjee after reaching the spot around 10.15 pm.Railway officials who work in the building said one of their colleagues, Sudipta Das, a technician and resident of Howrah, was missing.A senior railway official, Partha Sarathi Mondal, was missing, said members of his family who talked to the chief minister.The fire services personnel who died are Girish Deb, Gaurab Bej, Aniruddh Jana and Biman PurkaitThe Kolkata Police ASI was identified as Amit BhawalThe National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) was deployed to in the search operation a little before midnight.Several fire brigade personnel were taken to hospitals such as SSKM Hospital and B R Singh Hospital. Two of them were identified as Manoranjan Mudi and Arindam Dey. Both had inhaled smoke, officials said.The name of the RPF constable could not be ascertained, said a fire services official."I am deeply shocked. The chief minister had been constantly inquiring about the fire fighters. We are with the families of the bereaved," said Bose.The building plan could have helped a lot, the fire services minister told HT.The fire had broken out at the 13th floor of the Eastern Railway’s office in the evening.The 13th floor houses the accounts office, said ER employees who evacuated the building. The person who was hurt did not sustain any major injury, they said.The fire was detected around 6.10 pm. The high rise called Koilaghata Building, is located beside the Hooghly river.Chief minister Mamata Banerjee said that Railway officials hadn't arrived yet. "You can see that no railway official has come here so far. It is their property and they have a responsibility," she said.Sujit Bose said one RPF personnel could be identified and one person could not be identified.The bodies were found scattered on the floor that caught fire.The Kolkata Police ASI was attached to the local police station."We should always be careful. During a fire we should not use elevators. I am sure those who went up were experts in their field. Probably they wanted to work fast. This is unfortunate," said the chief minister."Money cannot compensate for loss of life but the state government will stand by these familes. Each family will be given a job and ₹10 lakh," she said."The fire is now under control," she added."Railways have their fire-fighting team too. What happened to that? It's our men who did all the work. Not all those who died live in Kolkata. One of them live in Baranagar in north Kolkata, I was told. The families have been informed. They are coming," said the chief minister.ER chief spokesperson Kamal Deo Das said, "Online booking of tickets will start once the fire is completely doused and electricity cables are connected."Banerjee left the spot at 12.10 am. She also went to SSKM hospital to inquire about the injured."It is difficult to identify the bodies because all are badly charred. Two or three of the deceased can be identified by their colleagues. The post mortem examination, which is mandatory, can be done tonight but how can we hand the bodies to the families without identification?" Banerjee said at SSKM hospital where the seven bodies were taken.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/7-killed-in-blaze-at-multi-storeyed-building-in-kolkata-101615225559199.html
09-03-2021||India||Women deployed aboard Indian Navy warships after almost 25 years||The Indian Navy has deployed four women officers on warships after a hiatus of almost 25 years, with the service focusing on steadily opening more roles to them, people familiar with the development said on Monday. India’s only aircraft carrier INS Vikramaditya and fleet tanker INS Shakti are the warships that have been assigned their first women crews since the late-1990s, said one of the officials cited above, asking not to be named. In a short-lived experiment, women from the navy’s logistics and medical branches were deployed on fleet tanker INS Jyoti in 1997. “Two women officers each have been assigned duties aboard INS Vikramaditya and INS Shakti. The numbers will only increase in the coming years with future warships having separate berthing facilities for women,” said a second official. While the aircraft carrier now has a woman air traffic controller and a logistics officer, the tanker’s crew includes a woman doctor and a logistics officer, he said. Excluding the medical wing in which women have served for decades, the navy accounts for 704 women officers who form 6.5% of the overall officer cadre. To mark Women’s Day, the navy on Monday released a video shot aboard INS Shakti with messages from the two women officers posted on the tanker. Also Watch | ‘To serve the nation’: IAF officers ask more women to join armed forces“They say women can’t have it all. But I would say dare to be different. The Indian Navy gave me the opportunity to be different and to dare,” said one of two women officers. The navy has progressively opened more roles to women over recent years. Last September, the navy announced that two women officers selected for the helicopter stream were set to become the first women in the navy’s history to operate from flight decks of warships and stay on board the vessels. The two lady officers, Sub-Lieutenants Kumudini Tyagi and Riti Singh, were among the 17 officers who were awarded wings on graduating as observers at a ceremony held in Kochi. As observers, the two women have been trained for a variety of roles including navigation, flying procedures, tactics employed in air warfare, anti-submarine warfare and airborne avionic systems. They are likely to be posted on warships by the year-end, said the second officials. They will serve on board maritime reconnaissance and anti-submarine warfare helicopters of the navy - currently Seaking choppers and later on MH-60R helicopters being bought from the United States. In 2019, Sub-Lieutenant Shivangi carved a place for herself in naval aviation history by becoming the first woman pilot in the navy. The headcount of women in the military has increased almost three-fold over the last six years, with more avenues being opened to them at a steady pace, latest government figures show. There are 9,118 women currently serving the army, navy and air force, with the services giving them more opportunities to boost career progression, the government told Parliament last month. One of the turning points for women in the military came in 2015 when the IAF decided to induct them into the fighter stream. Tanks and combat positions in infantry are still no-go zones for women, who were allowed to join the armed forces outside the medical stream for the first time in 1992.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/women-deployed-aboard-indian-navy-warships-after-almost-25-years-101615204097611.html

The state’s Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) was investigating the matter till now.The SUV was found abandoned on Carmichael Road, about 600 metres away from Antilia, the residence of Reliance Industries Chairman Mukesh Ambani, with 20 gelatin sticks on February 25, causing a security scare. The Mumbai Police had subsequently released details of a letter found in the car, addressed to the Reliance chairman and his wife, claiming this was just “a trailer”. The SUV sported fake plates with the registration number of the lead car in the security convoy deployed for the industrialist’s wife Nita Ambani.Also Read | Autopsy report of owner of SUV found near Ambani’s house ‘reserved’The vehicle had been stolen from Vikhroli on February 17.An Innova, which was said to be following the Scorpio early February 25, is also being investigated.

Hiren had reported the theft of his car on February 18.The Mumbai Police has registered a case of murder and criminal conspiracy in Hiren’s death.People cited above said the ministry of home affairs (MHA) has ordered the NIA probe as it has powers to suo motu hand over probes in scheduled offences under the Explosives Act or the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) to the central agency without the consent of state government. However, it is not clear whether NIA will take over probe into the death of Hiran as well because MHA cannot suo motu hand over a murder probe to it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/nia-to-probe-recovery-of-explosive-laden-vehicle-outside-ambani-residence-101615201457312.html

People have doubts whether this is a murder or suicide and that doubt needs to be cleared at the earliest. Why was he murdered, for what reasons, who is responsible? The faster the home department brings out the truth about these questions it will be better for the image and reputation of this government,” Raut said.Hiran, the man who came forward to say the SUV found with some explosives near billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s residence, was a vehicle he had reported stolen on February 18, was found dead in Kalwa creek on Friday morning, hours after his family reported he was missing. Maharashtra Home minister Anil Deshmukh has transferred the case to Anti-Terrorism Squad.Raut further said that the opposition must not make the death of the man an issue to score politically over the government. “The suspicious death of a key witness in an important case is definitely shocking, especially as it happened during the legislative session. But I think it is inappropriate for the opposition to accuse the government till the investigation is over… We all want to know the entire episode.”The Sena leader backed the Mumbai Police and dismissed the demand for an investigation by the NIA. “The opposition has demanded that the probe must be handed over the NIA. But it is not that only they can uncover the truth. Mumbai Police is more than capable. Home minister Anil Deshmukh has handed over the probe to Anti-Terrorism Squad and all the officers in it are equipped to handle such cases.”On leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis’ allegation that Mumbai Police officer Sachin Vaze was connected with the case, Raut said, “I do not think it is appropriate to take the name of an officer and speak on it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mumbai-police-capable-of-probing-mansukh-hiren-s-death-says-shiv-sena-101615013135244.html
