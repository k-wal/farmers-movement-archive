08-03-2021||India||After almost 25 years, women deployed aboard Indian warships||The Indian Navy has deployed four women officers on warships after a hiatus of almost 25 years, with the service focusing on steadily opening more roles to them, people familiar with the development said on Monday.India’s only aircraft carrier INS Vikramaditya and fleet tanker INS Shakti are the warships that have been assigned their first women crews since the late-1990s, said one of the officials cited above, asking not to be named. In a short-lived experiment, women from the navy’s logistics and medical branches were deployed on fleet tanker INS Jyoti in 1997.“Two women officers each have been assigned duties aboard INS Vikramaditya and INS Shakti. The numbers will only increase in the coming years with future warships having separate berthing facilities for women,” said a second official.While the aircraft carrier now has a woman air traffic controller and a logistics officer, the tanker’s crew includes a woman doctor and a logistics officer, he said.While Lieutenant Commander Priyanka Chaudhary and Lieutenant Sivi Bhardwaj are carrying out duties aboard INS Vikramaditya, Lieutenant Commander Tanisha Chakraborty and Surgeon Lieutenant Hannah Jane Thavapandian are serving aboard INS Shakti.“More roles being opened to women in the military is a natural progression. We are inching towards having women serve in every branch of the armed forces,” said Wing Commander Anupama Joshi (retd), from the first batch of women officers commissioned into the IAF in the early 1990s.Excluding the medical wing in which women have served for decades, the navy accounts for 704 women officers who form 6.5% of the overall officer cadre. To mark Women’s Day, the navy on Monday released a video shot aboard INS Shakti with messages from the two women officers posted on the tanker.“They say women can’t have it all. But I would say dare to be different. The Indian Navy gave me the opportunity to be different and to dare,” said Lieutenant Commander Tanisha Chakraborty, a logistics officer aboard INS Shakti.The navy has progressively opened more roles to women over recent years.Last September, the navy announced that two women officers selected for the helicopter stream were set to become the first women in the navy’s history to operate from flight decks of warships and stay on board the vessels.The two lady officers - Sub-Lieutenants Kumudini Tyagi and Riti Singh - were among the 17 officers who were awarded wings on graduating as observers at a ceremony held in Kochi. As observers, the two women have been trained for a variety of roles including navigation, flying procedures, tactics employed in air warfare, anti-submarine warfare and airborne avionic systems. They are likely to be posted on warships by the year-end, said the second officials.They will serve on board maritime reconnaissance and anti-submarine warfare helicopters of the navy - currently Sea King choppers and later on MH-60R helicopters being bought from the United States.In 2019, Sub-Lieutenant Shivangi carved a place for herself in naval aviation history by becoming the first woman pilot in the navy.The headcount of women in the military has increased almost three-fold over the last six years, with more avenues being opened to them at a steady pace, latest government figures show.There are 9,118 women currently serving in the army, navy and air force, with the services giving them more opportunities to boost career progression, the government told Parliament last month.One of the turning points for women in the military came in 2015 when the IAF decided to induct them into the fighter stream. Tanks and combat positions in infantry are still no-go zones for women, who were allowed to join the armed forces outside the medical stream for the first time in 1992.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-almost-25-years-women-deployed-aboard-indian-warships-101615227027873.html

The 'Gender-Inclusion Fund' in the NEP will be constituted to build the nation's capacity to provide equitable quality education for all girls," Dhotre said.Speaking on the occasion, DP Singh, Chairman of UGC observed that the theme of the webinar "Women Leadership- Achieving an equal future in a -19 world" has been announced by UNDP and is also aligned with the priority theme of the 65th Session of the UN Commission on the Status of Women.He highlighted the flagship Generation Equality campaign of the UN which calls for women's right to decision making in all areas of life, equal pay, equal sharing of unpaid care and domestic work, an end to all forms of violence against women and girls, and health care services that respond to their needs.Anita Karwal, Secretary, School Education mentioned the Gross Happiness Index of the World, 2018 in which freedom to make your own choices is one of the parameters for assessing Gross Happiness."If women play an important role in decision making, the Gross Happiness Index would go up. Unless there is access to resources and power to make choices women cannot progress," she said.Amit Khare, Secretary, Higher Education said that with the combined efforts of the Ministry of Education, Women and Child Environment, and the States the Gender Parity Index has increased during the last 4-5 years from 1% to 1.01% at present, which is a commendable achievement also appreciated by UNESCO.This implies that the percentage of girl students is more than boys in higher education.Women of four universities, Prof Najma Akhtar, Vice-Chancellors, Jamia Millia Islamia(JMI), Prof. Sushma Yadav, Vice-Chancellor, Bhagat Phul Singh (BPS) Women's University, Prof. Balwinder Shukla, Vice-Chancellor Amity University, Noida and Prof. Shalini Bharat, Director, Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS) also spoke at the webinar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/best-role-played-by-anyone-during-pandemic-that-of-mothers-education-minister-101615223259319.html

08-03-2021||India||Justice delivery system should not be to fulfill personal vendetta: SC||New Delhi, Mar 8 (PTI) Justice delivery system should not be used as a tool to “fulfil personal vendetta” and curtailing frivolous litigations is a crucial step towards a more effective justice system which is plagued with backlogs with 70 per cent pendency in subordinate courts being on criminal side, observed the Supreme Court on Monday.The apex court, which also observed that frivolous litigation should not become the order of the day in the country, said that a falsely accused person not only suffers monetary damages but is exposed to disrepute and stigma from society.It said trial courts have the duty to nip frivolous litigations in the bud even before they reach the stage of trial by discharging the accused in fit cases.”“A significant factor in this backlog is the vast mass of frivolous litigation instituted year after year by litigants with an intent to use the courts of justice for their own mischievous ends” a bench of Justices M M Shantanagoudar and R S Reddy said.“Curtailing such vexatious litigation is, thus, a crucial step towards a more effective justice system - a step that cannot be taken without the active involvement of the lower judiciary, especially in criminal proceedings,” it said while noting that justice dispensation machinery in India is plagued with backlogs, with 70 per cent of pendency before the subordinate courts being on the criminal side.The bench said this in its judgement while quashing the litigation between two parties initiated by them arising out of an incident in August 2012.The top court observed that the trial judge has a duty under the Constitution and the CrPC to identify and dispose of frivolous litigation at an early stage by exercising, substantially and to the fullest extent, the powers conferred on him.“Frivolous litigation should not become the order of the day in India. From misusing the public interest litigation jurisdiction of the Indian courts to abusing the criminal procedure for harassing their adversaries, the justice delivery system should not be used as a tool to fulfil personal vendetta. The Indian judiciary has taken cognizance of this issue,” the bench said.It referred to an 2014 order of the top court in which it had observed about the plight of a litigant caught in frivolous proceedings.“We note, with regret, that seven years hence, and there has still been no reduction in such plight,” it said, adding, “A falsely accused person not only suffers monetary damages but is exposed to disrepute and stigma from society. While running from pillar to post to find a lawyer to represent his case and arranging finances to defend himself before the court of law, he loses a part of himself.”It said that trial courts and magistrates have an important role in curbing this injustice and they are the first lines of defence for both the integrity of the criminal justice system and the harassed and distraught litigant.“We are of the considered opinion that the trial courts have the power to not merely decide on acquittal or conviction of the accused person after the trial, but also the duty to nip frivolous litigations in the bud even before they reach the stage of trial by discharging the accused in fit cases,” it said.“This would not only save judicial time that comes at the cost of public money, but would also protect the right to liberty that every person is entitled to under Article 21 of the Constitution,” the bench said.It further said, “Thus, it would be only proper for this court to deny any relief to a litigant who attempts to pollute the stream of justice by coming to it with his unclean hands. Similarly, a litigant pursuing frivolous and vexatious proceedings cant claim unlimited right upon court time and public money to achieve his ends.”The top court noted it is said that every trial is a voyage of discovery in which the truth is the quest.“In India, typically, the judge is not actively involved in ‘fact ­finding’ owing to the adversarial nature of our justice system,” it said.Referring to section 165 of the Indian Evidence Act 1872, which deals with judge's power to put questions or order production, the bench said this wide-­ranging power further demonstrates the central role played by the magistrate in the quest for justice and truth in criminal proceedings and must be judiciously employed to stem the flow of frivolous litigation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/justice-delivery-system-should-not-be-to-fulfill-personal-vendetta-sc-101615220979759.html

He alleged that the wall of the school was damaged due to the excavation and it collapsed trapping labourers working at the site.Police said that the injured were rushed to a local hospital and their condition was said to be serious.Satrunjay Mishra , the district magistrate in-charge, said the incident showed the negligence of the construction company.“Around 4.30pm a wall of the school suddenly collapsed. There was a loud sound and about 12 labourers got trapped under the debris”, said Mishra, adding that during the rescue operation, the bodies of the six labourers were pulled out. Six other labourers who were injured, were rushed to a hospital.Following the incident, the state government announced a probe into the incident and possible action against those responsible for the wall collapse. The government sought detailed enquiry from the administration. The police is expected to book the contractor for causing death by negligence and causing hurt by an act endangering life or personal safety of others.Chief minister Nitish Kumar expressed grief over the loss of lives in the incident and ordered compensation of ₹4 lakh for the families of each of the deceased. Irate over the incident, locals blocked the road, shouted slogans against the administration and demanded government jobs for the next of kin of the deceased.

08-03-2021||India||Iran rejects allegations linking it to blast outside Israeli embassy||Iran on Monday rejected what it said were allegations about the involvement of Iranian entities in the January 29 low-intensity blast outside the Israeli embassy in New Delhi and said it was ready to cooperate with Indian authorities in the investigation into the incident.A statement issued by the Iranian embassy said the “suspicious blast” in January had led to “an unfair onslaught and unsubstantiated defamatory accusations against Iran”. The statement also sought to link the incident to what were described as the “enemies of India-Iran relations”.The statement was issued after Hindustan Times reported on Monday that India’s central counter-terrorism agencies had drawn up a list of suspects connected to the blast using an improvised explosive device (IED), with investigations pointing to the Iranian Quds Force being behind the terror plot though the bomb was planted by an Indian Shia module.Quds Force is a key part of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. Following the blast, Indian security agencies recovered a letter addressed to the Israeli ambassador that swore revenge for Quds Force creator Qassem Soleimani and Abu Mehdhi Al Muhandis, both killed in a US drone attack in Baghdad in January 2020, and Iranian nuclear physicist Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, who was targeted in a car bombing last November.The statement did not refer to the HT report but rejected any Iranian involvement in the blast. It said the Iranian embassy condemns any act which leads to intimidation and fear, disruption of order and security, and jeopardises the lives and property of innocent people.“While respecting the honourable government and authorities of India in their endeavour to thoroughly investigate and probe into the above-mentioned incident in order to identify the orchestrators of such actions and to bring them to justice, this embassy strongly repudiates any unsubstantiated allegations or irresponsible comments in this regard and considers them as steps towards realising the sinister intentions of the enemies of Iran-India relations,” the statement said.Iranian authorities have “always expressed their readiness to cooperate with the Indian friends in order to unravel the wicked intentions of the spoilers of bilateral relations”, it added.The statement further pointed to the boosting of “long-standing and cordial relations” between Iran and India in all domains, “including in the form of exchange of the two countries’ high ranking political, economic, security and defence delegations” and sought to question who would gain from the blast.“Is the presumption that this act must have been conducted by third parties who are angry and dissatisfied with the progress in the relations between the governments of Iran and India illogical?” the statement said.“We expect all the media and commentators not to fall into the traps and thereby unknowingly enforce the scenarios conspired by third parties whose intention and interest is nothing but to deteriorate the growing Iran-India relations,” the statement added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/iran-rejects-allegations-linking-it-to-blast-outside-israeli-embassy-101615220269862.html

Consequently, it can pick and choose the types of refugees it will accept or rejectBuddhists from Tibet, fleeing China’s persecution, have been welcomed in India but Rohingyas fleeing from religious persecution in Myanmar are generally denied entry into India.Responding to media queries after addressing a party convention on the occasion of international women’s day, Dr Abdullah said, “We know about Burma and the situation there. We all know what their army is doing there. There is a UN refugee charter to which India is also a signatory. We should accept it and work on it and behave humanely on the issue”.On a one year extension to the delimitation commission for assembly elections in Jammu and Kashmir, he said, “Whether elections are held or not, we have prepared for them.”Asked whether he will campaign for the Congress in the upcoming elections in four states and a union territory, he said that he doesn’t have time for campaigning.On speculations over Ghulam Nabi Azad after retirement from the Rajya Sabha and G23 meeting in Jammu recently, he said, “Azad was, is and will remain a Congressman. The Prime Minister didn’t try to bring him in the BJP but praised him for his humanity exhibited during a terror attack on a bus of Amarnath pilgrims from Gujarat in 2007.”Earlier, during his address to the audience at party headquarters, the National Conference chief pointed out that terrorism hasn’t ended although the Centre had claimed that it would after the abrogation of Article 370 and 35-A which granted special status to Jammu and Kashmir.“People are now losing their land due to the abrogation of Article 370. They said that terrorism will end. Has it ended? Even today after more than one and half years of abrogating Article 370 people are being killed .. two policemen were killed in Srinagar. They were Muslims but a terrorist has no religion.”The People's Democratic Party (PDP) has also asked the administration to treat the Rohingyas in the context of a humanitarian crisis."The index of the country on the humanitarian and social acceptance front has already suffered a setback at the international level. The issue of Rohingyas should be seen in the context of a humanitarian crisis rather than taking it as an issue of religious belief. The administration must act cautiously while keeping in mind the sufferings and trauma these refugees have faced back in their own country forcing them to flee for a safe refuge in India," said PDP spokesperson and former MLC Firdous Tak.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/behave-humanely-with-rohingyas-farooq-abdullah-tells-centre-101615217675761.html

The verbal communication with the chief minister of Assam during that time was that we should meet sometime during April last year," the chief minister told the Assembly during a short duration discussion initiated by Opposition MLA M Syiem.But beacuse of the pandemic the talks could not take place at those points of time, he said.Now Assam is facing election so only when the new government is installed we will pursue this matter to take the discussion forward to see how we can find an amicable solution to this problem, Sangma said.On the opposition's demand to stop the alleged illegal construction of a transit camp in Ri Bhoi district, he assured that necessary steps will be taken to discuss the issue with the Assam Government and to figure out how such incidents don't take place in future.The Ri Bhoi deputy commissioner had submitted a detailed report on this issue on February 25 and had written to her counterpart in Assam to intervene and stop the construction of the transit camp and that it be kept in abeyance.If it cannot be resolved at that level, it can scaled up to nodal officers and then to the chief secretary level. Therefore, there is a process that is followed, he said.On development schemes under the inter-state border development programme, Sangma said the programme has a very small budget of ₹3-4 crore for the entire state, which translates to ₹30 lakh to ₹40 lakh for the different constituencies along the border.All line departments like PHE, PWD, education and tourism departments implement the programmes for the development of the border districts, he said.Sangma also told the house that several development projects undertaken by both state governments at the disputed areas have been stopped. Meghalaya had stopped 16 developmental works undertaken by Assam, while four such works initiated by Meghalaya was stopped by Assam.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/interstate-boundary-talks-with-assam-after-election-meghalaya-cm-sangma-101615216863912.html
08-03-2021||India||Supreme Court stays demolition of Dargah Mubarak Khan Shaheed in Gorakhpur||The Supreme Court on Monday ordered a stay on any further demolition of the Dargah Mubarak Khan Shaheed in Uttar Pradesh’s Gorakhpur till the pending proceedings under the Uttar Pradesh Public Premises Act, 1972, have been disposed of. "In the meantime, further demolition is restrained till disposal of the proceedings pending under the Uttar Pradesh Public Premises (Eviction of Unauthorised Occupants) Act, 1972," the top court’s order read.The stay on the demolition comes as the court was orally informed by the petitioner—Dargah Mubarak Khan Shaheed—that it had received a letter dated March 8 from the secretary of the Gorakhpur Development Authority (GDA) requesting the city’s superintendent of police to deploy a force and begin the demolition work from Tuesday, reported LiveLaw.The division bench, comprising Justice Navin Sinha and Justice Krishna Murari, have also issued notice to the state in the issue. The special leave petition on the behalf of Dargah Mubarak Khan Shaheed has been filed against Allahabad High Court judgement of February 10, which dismissed the petitioner's request of declaring the demolition as void and prohibited authorities for further demolition, as reported by LiveLaw.The petitioner in the plea has said that the idgah has a tomb of Saint Mubarak Khan Shaheed and a mosque on the southern side of the tomb, which has been there for a long time and was used for prayers and festivities. According to the petitioner, the use of the properties was in 1959 disturbed by the principal of Government Normal School after which egress and ingress were stopped, leading to the filing of a suit before munsif's court. One of the relief sought that time against the defendants, including the Uttar Pradesh state and Gorakhpur collector, was to open the eastern gate of the Brijman compound for the egress and ingress. The suit went in the plaintiff's favour, LiveLaw cited the petitioner as saying.Also Read | No major report of discordant results reported by Covid-19 testing labs: GovtThe plea said that the trial court in its order has said that Muslims and the plaintiff have the right to use the land near the mosque and idgah for offering prayers sans any interference. However, a show-cause notice was later issued to the alleged unauthorised occupants, including the petitioner, to state why the eviction order cannot be passed, after the sub-divisional officer in an order in June 2019 proposed to initiate proceedings under section 4 of the UP Public Premises Act 1972 and asked the Subordinate Revenue Authorities to enquire and make a report on the matter.The plea also claimed that the Gorakhpur Development Authority without any notice to the petitioner began the demolition work and treated its possession as unauthorised. The authority after the demolition of a part of the property also asked the petitioner to produce another document to prove its right even after referring to the trial court order of 1963. The petitioner had then filed an application before the sub-divisional officer, LiveLaw cited the plea.The plea, as LiveLaw said, also had the mention of the appeal to Allahabad High Court for quashing the demolition. The high court had ordered the stay on demolition till next hearing, however, through its impugned order of February 10, had dismissed the case stating that in pith and substance the petitioner wants the execution of judgement and decree of the trial court order dated September 1963. The high court said the remedy for the petitioner is to file a civil suit for the grant of injunction or file for the execution of the decree.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-stays-demolition-of-dargah-mubarak-khan-shaheed-in-gorakhpur-101615212329783.html

The report, ‘Covid-19: A threat to progress against child marriage’, released on International Women’s Day estimated that 650 million girls and women alive today got married in childhood and about half of them are in Bangladesh, Brazil, Ethiopia, India and Nigeria. “In the last ten years, the proportion of young women globally who were married as children had decreased by 15 per cent, from nearly 1 in 4 to 1 in 5, the equivalent of some 25 million marriages averted, a gain that is now under threat,” it also said.Read more: Closure of 1.5mn schools impacted 247mn children in India: Unicef studyThe United Nations agency said that the levels of child marriage were highest in sub-Saharan Africa, where 35 per cent of young women were married before the age of 18 which was followed by South Asia, where nearly 30 per cent of women were married before they turned 18. Latin America and the Caribbean had about 24 per cent of child marriages and the Middle East and North Africa had 17 per cent of child marriages. Eastern Europe and Central Asia had about 12 per cent of child marriages according to the report.Impact of Covid-19The report said that closing of schools, economic stress, parental deaths and pregnancies due to the coronavirus pandemic could increase the risk of child marriage.Read more: '375 mn Indian children may suffer due to Covid-19 pandemic': CSE report“Covid-19 has made an already difficult situation for millions of girls even worse. Shuttered schools, isolation from friends and support networks, and rising poverty have added fuel to a fire the world was already struggling to put out. But we can and we must extinguish child marriage,” Unicef’s executive director Henrietta Fore said.Situation before the pandemicAt least 100 million girls were at risk of child marriage in the next decade even before the pandemic. But, according to Unicef, the proportion of young women who were married as children had decreased by 15 per cent in the last 10 years globally and that the equivalent of around 25 million marriages had been averted in that period. “Through the Sustainable Development Goals, the world committed to ending child marriage by 2030. This obligation extends to the 10 million girls whose futures are now in jeopardy along with the 100 million girls at risk of becoming child brides before the pandemic began,” the report said.Read more: School shut, digital divide: How Covid upended educationSolutions to the problemFore advised countries to take action and implement effective laws and practices while ensuring access to health as well as social services.

By taking these steps, Fore added that “we can significantly reduce a girl’s risk of having her childhood stolen through child marriage”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/unicef-report-on-child-marriages-has-a-stark-warning-for-india-4-more-countries-101615214746930.html
08-03-2021||India||International Women's Day: Thanks to liquor ban, women safe in Gujarat, says CM Rupani||Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani on Monday said women were safe in the state because of total prohibition on liquor here.While addressing the Assembly on Monday, Rupani said any relaxation in these restrictions would jeopardize the security of women."Women's safety and security is the responsibility of the government. Since liquor is a social evil, we never gave any relaxation in the prohibition policy. The day we give relaxations, women will no longer be safe," Rupani told the House on the occasion of International Women's Day."Thanks to our liquor prohibition policy, women are able to travel alone at night without any fear," he added.Unlike other countries where Women's Day celebrations are a one-day affair, respecting women as the manifestation of strength is a part of Indian culture, he said.Though Gujarat has implemented 33 per cent reservation for women in police recruitment and 50 per cent reservation in local bodies like district panchayats and civic corporations, "it is desirable that more women are elected to the Assembly", the CM said.There are 13 women MLAs in the 182-member Assembly.Meanwhile, Deputy Chief Minister Nitin Patel informed the House that these 13 women MLAs will get an additional grant of ₹1 crore for construction and repairing of roads in their constituencies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/international-women-s-day-thanks-to-liquor-ban-women-safe-in-gujarat-says-cm-rupani-101615215627796.html

08-03-2021||India||Odisha forms task force to control wildfires as more forests start burning||The Odisha government on Monday formed a task force on Forest Fire Management to fight raging bushfires in the Similipal biosphere reserve in Mayurbhanj district and three other wildlife habitats and warned of strict action against those setting fire to the forests.A notification of state forest department said a task force headed by former principal chief conservator of forests of Odisha, Dr. Sandeep Tripathy will review the current forest fires, causes and immediate containment. It will also suggest measures for augmentation of existing fire management protocols including Geomatics-based Fire Alert System. The other members of the team include current PCCF Jitendra Kumar, chief wildlife warden Shashi Paul, director general of Forest Survey of India Pankaj Agarwal as well as representative of director general ICFRE Dehradun, member of local NGO and a journalist from Mayurbhanj.The taskforce will recommend suggestions for improved community participation in fire management and prevention, conduct post assessment of forest fire-affected area, loss to wildlife, biodiversity and suggest appropriate measures for augmentation and give suggestions for improvement of SOP for fire prevention and management in the state to prevent such occurrences.The constitution of the task force came even as the state reported over 23,325 forest fires in the last 7 days, the highest in the country. On Monday, Odisha reported 668 large fires, which was more than 60 per cent of the total large fire incidents in the country. In Similipal tiger reserve, where fires are still being reported from many parts of the buffer zone, a local outfit ‘Bhanja Sena’ has called for a 12-hour bandh in Mayurbhanj district March 10 to protest the administration’s failure in controlling the fire.Environmental activist Biswajit Mohanty said the blame for failure in controlling the forest fires should be squarely put on the shoulders of PCCF. "A quick survey of Telkoi Range in Keonjhar district reveals they have just 27 squad members whereas requirement is at least 10 times. The department is badly understaffed. The fire squads are understaffed due to improper assessment by senior officers who approved plans. The department needs to spend ₹300 crores and ₹50 crores every year. At least Rs. 30,000 crores of timber is lost due to fire every year," alleged Mohanty.Fires have been reported from Kuldiha sanctuary in Balasore, Satkosia sanctuary in Anugul and Sunabeda sanctuary in Nuapara district. In Kuldiha sanctuary fire erupted from Nandia hills and spread to other parts of the jungle posing serious threat to the wildlife. "The situation is alarming like that of Similipal. The forest department must realise the importance of community participation and community ownership of forest, the key to forest protection," said senior Congress leader Sudarshan Das.Principal chief conservator of forests, Jitendra Kumar said wildfires in forest areas of the State are not new but a natural phenomenon. "Like every year, fires generally spread on bushes and shrubs but do not affect trees. We have had no case of crown fire this year,” he said. "The rise in forest fires over Odisha this year is due to rise in daytime temperatures and lack of winter rains."Congress chief whip Mohan Charan Majhi, however, said it has been an abject failure on the part of the government in controlling the fires and the task force would not serve any purpose.“As many 668 large forest fires have been reported in Odisha today. While the government is claiming that the fires have been doused, the actual scenario tells a different story. Despite availability of modern techniques to contain wildfire, the government has failed to do so,” he said.BJP MLA Subhash Panigrahi alleged that the government is intentionally setting the forests on fire to cover up the misuse in Compensatory Afforestation Fund Management and Planning Authority (CAMPA) fund.Meanwhile, in Baripada, Divisional Forest Officer Santosh Joshi has cancelled leaves of all forest staff under the division even as fresh reports of fire incidents have been reported from several points under Udala, Dujura, Bangiriposi, Rasgovindpur ranges close to Similipal biosphere reserve. A tribal man named Pradhan Hembram was on Monday arrested on charges of setting fire the Badampahar reserve forest under Dudhiani range.In Sambalpur division, DFO Sanjeet Kumar warned of stringent legal action against those found intentionally setting forest on fire. "People found setting fire to forest areas will be put behind bars without any delay," he said and announced a provision of cash award of ₹5000 for anyone who informs about people setting fire in forest areas.“Mass awareness is being created and we have appealed to the public to cooperate with the forest department. Setting forest on fire is a punishable offence under the Odisha Forest Act and one(s) found guilty of such crime may be punished with a jail term of 3 to 7 years,” said Sanjeet Kumar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-forms-task-force-to-control-wildfires-as-more-forests-start-burning-101615214470540.html

The person who was hurt did not sustain any major injury, they said. 7 people have been reported dead so far. The fire was detected around 6.15 pm. The high rise called Koilaghata Building, is located beside the Hooghly river.The intensity of the fire reduced around 9.30 pm, fire brigade officials said.Because of the blaze, electricity connections to the building had to be snapped temporarily. This stopped online booking of tickets in all zones of the Eastern Railway, officials said.At least eight people including fire brigade personnel fell ill while dousing the flames inside the building because of the thick smoke. Ambulances were pressed into service to take them to hospital.Fire services minister Sujit Bose said, "At least three fire brigade personnel and two Kolkata Police personnel have fallen ill. The rescue teams are looking for people who need help. It is pitch dark inside the building."Urban development minister Firhad Hakim and Kolkata Police commissioner Soumen Mitra rushed to the spot."It is a big fire. Ten fire tenders have been pressed into service. A hydraulic ladder has also been rushed to the spot. I am on my way," Bose said earlier in the evening."It is difficult to say what caused the fire. More fire tenders and firefighters are being sent," Bose added.Fire brigade officials said at 7.30 pm that firefighters had managed to reach the 12th floor.Kolkata Police officials restricted traffic movement on Stand Road, which is mostly used by people heading for Howrah station and the river jetties from where ferry services are available.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fire-at-eastern-railway-office-in-kolkata-one-injured-101615213237012.html

It has also announced a social security pension of ₹1,000 per month to elderly women in the age group of 65-69 years under the Swaran Jayanti Nari Sambal Yojana.The leader of opposition criticised the state government for not announcing any relief in the Budget for the 2.25-lakh government employees.Agnihotri said no permanent job would be provided by the state government in 2021-22. It has been stated in the Budget that the state government would provide 30,000 jobs but they are either on contractual basis on small salary or on outsource basis, he said. People say selection of 4,000 of them has already been finalised, Agnihotri added.The leader of opposition said, "Beware of God. Former Haryana CM is already in jail."Agnihotri said that the government also did not announce a reduction of VAT on petroleum products to provide relief to the people. Further, subsidy on various items has also been reduced from ₹1,200 crore to ₹1,000 crore, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/himachal-pradesh-leader-of-opposition-says-state-government-hiding-several-economic-data-in-budget-101615212737546.html
08-03-2021||India||Apni Party chief Altaf Bukhari demands restoration of J-K’s statehood, elections||Apni Party president Altaf Bukhari on Monday demanded the immediate restoration of statehood to Jammu and Kashmir and holding assembly elections.The party, which was launched last year in March by former People’s Democratic Party leader Bukhari, observed its foundation day in Srinagar.“We have pledged to ourselves what we said on our day of launch that restoration of statehood is our priority and holding of assembly elections. We demand that the statehood should be restored immediately and elections held as soon as possible,” Bukhari told the media while being flanked by many senior leaders including Srinagar’s mayor Junaid Mattoo.Bukhari said that the people including the political parties should join to fight for the promises made by the Union home minister Amit Shah. “We will have to fight for our rights. People say that statehood has been promised, I tell those that many things were promised in 1947 also but did we get those,” he said.“We will have to fight for everything. If I had not gone (to Delhi to meet leadership), the jobs would not have been restored for us. Till the next government was formed thousands of people from outside would have gotten jobs here,” he said.Bukhari had met Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah in March last year with a charter of demands including restoration of statehood, domicile rights for land and jobs, pursuing for an early hearing on Article 370 , return of people stuck due to Covid-19, release of political detainees and restoration of internet 4G services.He met the Prime Minister once more in January this year.Jammu and Kashmir’s special status under Article 370 was revoked on August 5, 2019 by the Parliament and the state was split into two union territories – J&K with an assembly and Ladakh without one.The Apni Party chief said that political parties should not sit back and watch how the BJP’s plan unfolds. “Yes I agree BJP has a plan but does that mean we will sit back and watch. No, we will have to defend our ability. We won’t sit back. I request every political party that we will get nothing by sitting quietly. Ultimately we will get what is achievable and we should all join hands for that,” he said.Bukhari claimed that every resident of Jammu and Kashmir wants restoration of Article 370.“There is no one in Jammu and Kashmir who does not want its restoration but only the Parliament or the Supreme Court can make that happen,” he said.Recollecting revocation of Article 370 and 35-A, he said these were not numerical numbers. “These represented our emotions. It was as if our emotions were snatched away from us. Everybody was suffering, every section of society,” he said."August 5, 2019 was a black day. We can never forget what happened to us on that day. It was no less than the most heinous thing which could happen to people anywhere," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/apni-party-chief-altaf-bukhari-demands-restoration-of-j-k-s-statehood-elections-101615211327455.html
08-03-2021||India||Waiting for govt to respond, says farmer hailed by PM Modi for patent win||Elated that his innovation caught the attention of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Hyderabad-based farmer Chintala Venkat Reddy has also expressed disappointment that there has been no response from any of the government bodies or the agriculture universities over his patented product.During his radio show Mann Ki Baat on February 28, PM Modi urged the students and youth to know more about Indian science by following the path shown by Reddy, an ‘innovative farmer,’ who had come up with varieties of wheat and rice that were naturally enriched with Vitamin D.“These appreciations and congratulatory messages are fine, but I expect that the government will come forward to take this innovation to the people. I am ready to sign a Memorandum of Understanding with the government to take this technology into the fields all over the country, so that India can export paddy and wheat enriched with Vitamin D across the world,” Reddy said.On February 11, the 70-year-old farmer won a patent for his innovation from the World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO) for his new findings. “It is a matter of pride for the Government of India that Reddy was honoured with the Padma Shri award last year,” PM Modi said.According to the WIPO document, which was seen by HT, the invention by Reddy puts forth a new composition based on non-chemical, natural plant- based extracts to produce crop plants with high Vitamin D content, without genetic modification or application of chemicals.“During this coronavirus pandemic, every doctor has been talking about how Vitamin D deficiency will affect the immunity of the body. But I felt this natural way of enriching the food with Vitamin D will go a long way in improving the immunity levels of the human being,” he said.The cultivator said he would wait some more for the state and the central governments to respond. “Otherwise, I don’t mind tying up with multinational companies for the commercial exploitation of my patented product,” he said.Already, Reddy has been in talks with an MNC based out of Mumbai for signing an agreement for mass production of these new varieties of rice and wheat. He, however, refused to divulge further details about the MNC at this stage.Telangana agriculture commissioner and secretary B Janardhan Reddy, however, said the state government had all the appreciation for the innovation of Venkat Reddy and would definitely encourage his product.“However, there is a procedure in the government for mass production of the new varieties of rice or paddy. It has to be studied by the scientists at Prof Jayashankar Agricultural University and then given the approval by the Indian Council of Agriculture Research. We shall definitely hold discussions with Venkat Reddy on how to take it forward,” the commissioner said.According to Reddy, there is no Vitamin D in the normal varieties of rice or and wheat available in the market at present. “Through my experiments in my own fields in Alwal near Secunderabad, I succeeded in producing a rice variety containing Vitamin D to the extent of 102-141 international units (IU) per 100 grams and a wheat variety consisting of 1,606 IU in 100 grams,” he said.He first applied for a national patent at Indian Patent Office in Chennai on August 2, 2019 and a year later, he applied for an international patent on August 1, 2020. “After a lot of studies and enquiries, the World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO) published the study, granting patent to my products,” Reddy said.Reddy used various nutrient-enhancing compositions such as carrot extract, maize flour and sweet potato extract, which increase Vitamin D content in plants when applied during irrigation of crop plants. These extracts were prepared in various methods like cooking and blending and mixing them with water in certain concentrations and supplied to the fields through various methods of irrigation. In some methods, the seed of the paddy or wheat are soaked in these extracts before sowing.Queried how a school dropout could come up with such innovative experiments, he said: “Well, there is no need for any formal degree to experiment with agriculture. It comes naturally. As regards my research on Vitamin-D-rich crops, Sun god is my inspiration.”Reddy also did several other experiments with soil. Last year, he also invented a technique of mud spray on crops which would act as pest repellent. “This has helped me and my fellow farmers to prevent the locust attack on our fields,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/waiting-for-govt-to-respond-says-farmer-hailed-by-pm-modi-for-patent-win-101615212117542.html

This month, the same cylinder costs ₹819.Small price hikes over the past couple of years have eliminated subsidy on cooking gas as well as PDS kerosene.Pradhan said the price of domestic subsidised LPG has been raised during the last few months. It cost ₹594 per cylinder in December 2020 and now is priced at ₹819.Similarly, kerosene sold to the poor through the public distribution system (PDS) has risen from ₹14.96 per litre in March 2014 to ₹35.35 this month, he said.Petrol and diesel prices too are at an all-time high across the country.The rates, which vary from state to state depending on local sales tax (VAT), are currently at ₹91.17 a litre for petrol and ₹81.47 for diesel in Delhi."Prices of petrol and diesel have been made market determined by the government with effect from June 26, 2010 and October 19, 2014 respectively," Pradhan said. "Since then, the public sector oil marketing companies (OMCs) take appropriate decision on pricing of petrol and diesel in line with their international product prices, exchange rate, tax structure, inland freight and other cost elements."With taxes accounting for the bulk of the retail selling price of petrol and diesel, the minister said tax collected on the two fuels was ₹52,537 crore in 2013, which rose to ₹2.13 lakh crore in 2019-20 and swelled further to ₹2.94 lakh crore in the first 11 months of current fiscal year.The government currently levies ₹32.90 per litre excise duty on petrol and ₹31.80 a litre on diesel, he said adding that excise duty on petrol was ₹17.98 a litre in 2018 and ₹13.83 on diesel.Pradhan said the central government's total excise collection from petrol, diesel, ATF, natural gas and crude oil has increased from ₹2.37 lakh crore in 2016-17 to ₹3.01 lakh crore during April-January 2020-21.Between November 2014 and January 2016, the government had raised excise duty on petrol and diesel on nine occasions to take away gains arising from plummeting global oil prices.In all, the duty on petrol rate was hiked by ₹11.77 per litre and that on diesel by 13.47 a litre in those 15 months.The government had cut excise duty by ₹2 in October 2017, and by ₹1.50 a year later. But, it raised excise duty by ₹2 per litre in July 2019. It again raised excise duty in March 2020, by ₹3 per litre each. In May that year, the government hiked excise duty on petrol by ₹10 per litre and on diesel by ₹13 a litre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lpg-price-double-in-7-yrs-tax-collection-on-petrol-diesel-jumps-459-says-oil-minister-pradhan-101615210185541.html

They are very happy with the developmental work of our government ... They are convinced that only BJP-led NDA government can provide security, peace and development."These commitments were fulfilled in the last five years of our regime. That is why people are eagerly waiting for the polling days to come," Sonowal told reporters here.BJP had promised an Assam free from corruption, pollution, terrorism and illegal foreigners along with ushering in development. The people have got the assurance of their fulfillment because of the "sincere efforts" by the BJP-led government in all these fronts, he added.Asked what will be his message to the people during the campaigning, Sonowal said "Only development. For making an 'atmanirbhar Bharat' (self reliant India), we have to make an 'atmanirbhar Assam' (self reliant Assam). That is why we are aiming to make Assam one of the best states in the country."He exuded confidence that the BJP-led three-party alliance will achieve its target of winning over 100 seats out of 126 during the forthcoming Assembly polls."The people are seeing the condition of the opposition parties. They don't have any noble aim but only want to create confusion. So, the party having no specific goal and no clear policy cannot give security, peace and development to public," Sonowal said.The BJP has clear policies on important aspects of life and the government has worked with that in the past, he added."Filing of nomination has begun.

08-03-2021||India||Proportion of men donating organs improved in past 2 decades in India: Data||Over the past two decades, the proportion of men donating organs has increased in India. While between 1998 to 2007, just 26% of the livers for children were donated by men, the percentage has risen to 46% between 2008 and 2021, according to the data provided by a large tertiary care hospital from Delhi. Women have predominantly been organ donors in the country. “When paediatric liver transplant started in India, people did not know much about the surgery. The parents did not know of anyone who had undergone a transplant or even heard of someone who had. They did not know whether it would succeed and how the life of the children would be after the transplant. Plus, it is also a major surgery for the donor. So, when it came to men in the family, they are more questioning about the procedure, whereas the mothers just donated their liver,” said Dr Anupam Sibal, paediatric gastroenterologist and hepatologist at Indraprastha Apollo hospital. When it came to recipients, the ratio is skewed in favour of the male child. Between 1998 and 2012, only 29% of the livers went to male children, data from Apollo hospital suggests. This ratio has improved to 40% between 2016 and 2021.Also Read | Organ Donation: Brain-dead Mohali man gives new lease of life to two“This is an encouraging trend to see that more and more girl children are undergoing transplant. Initially, parents were worried about whether the girls would undergo normal puberty, what about their wedding. These concerns are slowly easing up now that they have seen others, more people are willing to do it,” said Dr Sibal. Established success of liver transplants, increased access to it, and reduced costs at high flow centres have also helped in changing the trends. “The success rate of liver transplant at 8 years is around 90%, now people know about this. They have seen others receiving the treatment too. Then, there are high volume centres like ours where the costs have come down. It costs about Rs15 lakh for a transplant; it was much more when we had started,” he said.“And, when it comes to the cost, we receive donations from our previous patients, there are several funds like PM relief fund and CM relief fund that also provides for the surgeries,” said Dr Sibal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/proportion-of-men-donating-organs-improved-in-past-2-decades-in-indiadata-101615203857431.html

The allegations came a day after DMK chief MK Stalin said that if voted to power in the 2021 assembly elections, his party would give ₹1000 per month to every housewife in the state. It was one of the seven key promises that he made while announcing his party’s vision ahead for the next 10 years.Also read | DMK finalises seat-sharing deal with seven allies in TN“I would be pleased if the DMK, which had copied all the highlights of our election manifesto, will also take up our honesty,” Haasan tweeted in Tamil.எங்கள் தேர்தல் அறிக்கையின் சிறப்பம்சங்கள் அனைத்தையும் பிரதியெடுத்துக் கொண்ட கழகம் எங்கள் நேர்மையையும், தூய்மையையும் கைக்கொண்டால் மகிழ்வேன்.The actor-turned-politician also centred his women’s day wishes around the topic. “Our party [MNM], which intends to give government salary to housewives, celebrates womanhood every day,” he said on Twitter.MNM’s vice president, R Mahendran, also alleged that the DMK had repeated the welfare measures announced earlier in their election manifesto in the poll-bound southern state. “In February 2020, we had presented 'Reimagining Tamil Nadu' with measures for women homemakers. If they (DMK) have proof that this vision was launched before, please educate us. No doubt that it came from us,” news agency ANI quoted Mahendran as saying.The MNM chief made these promises during his poll campaign in southern Tamil Nadu districts while interacting with the fishing communities in the coastal Thoothukudi district in December last year. He said to a cheering crowd that many people had mocked him for his announcement of salary to housewives but European nations are thinking about experimenting with such an idea.Assembly elections are scheduled in Tamil Nadu for April 6 and Haasan’s MNM had been projecting itself as an alternate to the two Dravidian majors DMK and All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kamal-haasan-s-mnm-alleges-dmk-has-copied-its-poll-promises-101615202894873.html

Notably, International Men’s Day is celebrated on November 19 around the world.Mansingh also used an anonymous quote in her speech as she began talking about International Women’s Day. “I want to read this quote that I read somewhere… It's hard to be a woman.

The women’s reservation bill was introduced in Parliament on September 12, 1996, by the United Front government of HD Dewe Gowda.

08-03-2021||India||PM Modi to travel to Bangladesh on March 26, his first visit abroad in 15 months||Prime Minister Narendra Modi will make an overnight visit to Bangladesh on March 26 to join celebrations in the neighbouring country to mark the 50th anniversary of its freedom in 1971, people aware of the matter said.The two-day trip to Dhaka will be PM Modi’s first foreign visit in 15 months and is seen to reflect New Delhi’s emphasis on its ties with Bangladesh which PM Modi has described as “an important pillar” of India's neighbourhood first’ policy. He last travelled abroad In November 2019 and like everyone else, had to scrap his travel plans over the last year due to the coronavirus pandemic.PM Modi will be the chief guest at the main event organised by the Sheikh Hasina government to commemorate Sheikh Mujibur Rahman declaring erstwhile East Pakistan as an independent country, Bangladesh, on March 26, 1971. India sided with Bangladesh and helped defeat Pakistani forces who eventually surrendered on December 16, 1971.External affairs minister S Jaishankar was in Dhaka last week to prepare for PM Modi visit called the deepening strategic ties between the two countries as a “360-degree partnership” and stressed that PM Modi’s visit will surely be a “very memorable” visit.The visit comes at a time, Indian officials said, when there was tremendous goodwill for the Indian government and its people in Bangladesh on account of New Delhi going the extra mile to make the coronavirus vaccine available to the neighbouring country.New Delhi has supplied 9 million doses of Covid vaccine to Dhaka including 2 million doses as a gift from the people of India. The remaining 7 million doses were sent on a commercial basis after Bangladesh decided to rely on the Indian vaccines rather than the vaccine pushed by Beijing.“India has kept the promise that it had made,” a senior government official said, a reference to PM Modi’s assurance to Sheikh Hasina during their virtual summit in December. PM Modi had assured her that the vaccines will be made available to Bangladesh as and when India produces them, and also offered a partnership in vaccine production.It was at this summit that Sheikh Hasina had declared that “India is our true friend”.Officials said it was on account of New Delhi delivering on its commitment that Jaishankar returned from Dhaka last week with the sense that Bangladesh’s opposition parties, which are often critical or suspicious of New Delhi, appreciated India’s move.There are not big-ticket agreements planned during PM Modi’s visit. The two countries had signed seven agreements in areas ranging from hydrocarbons to agriculture at the Modi-Hasina summit in December.Tomorrow, he will inaugurate via video conference, the 'Maitri Setu', a bridge built over the Feni river, between India and Bangladesh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-to-travel-to-bangladesh-on-march-26-his-first-visit-abroad-in-15-months-101615199944585.html

PM Modi made the comments during the meeting of the national committee to commemorate ‘Azadi Ka Amrut Mahotsav’ - a central government programme to mark 75 years of India's Independence."When we talk about public participation for preparations, it engulfs the aspirations, feelings, thoughts, suggestions and dreams of 130 crore Indians. The celebrations can be divided in five sub-heads - Freedom struggle, Ideas at 75, Achievements at 75, Actions at 75 and Resolve at 75," PM Modi said in his address. “We are fortunate that in time, the country has given us the responsibility to make this festival a reality,” he said."This festival of 75 years of Independence should be a festival in which the spirit of freedom struggle and its renunciation can be experienced, in which there is also a tribute to the martyrs of the country and the resolve to make India of their dreams, in which there is a glimpse of the glory of Sanatan Bharat, which also has the glow of modern India," PM Modi said.The celebrations, PM Modi said, should reflect India's freedom struggle and should pay a tribute to our freedom fighters. "It should also give a clear picture of how they wanted to build India. While keeping India's heritage intact, it should reflect modern India ideally," he said.He added that when India celebrates the 75th year of its Independence, it will take bold steps to achieve targets that seemed impossible at some point. "With your help and cooperation, these celebrations will be at par with India's idea and stature," the PM said.The Prime Minister will launch 'Azadi Ka Amrut Mahotsav' on March 12, the day Mahatma Gandhi launched Dandi March from Gujarat's Sabarmati Ashram in 1930.The commemorations will include 75 events for 75 weeks with one prominent event every week.

During the pandemic, members of the two Houses started sitting in different shifts to ensure social distancing norms. On Monday, Rajya Sabha chairman Venkaiah Naidu announced that the House will meet at 11am on Tuesday. A similar announcement is expected in Lok Sabha too. The original schedule from 11am to 6pm will give more time for the two Houses to clear business or discuss issues.A Rajya Sabha official said that both Houses could meet at 11am from the second week following the vaccination of eligible MPs. “Since many MPs would be busy campaigning, we are not expecting a full house this session,” the official said, requesting anonymity. Also Read | After being disrupted thrice over fuel price hike, Rajya Sabha adjournedAnother official said: “Therefore, the current system of allotment of seats covering both Houses will be scrapped and MPs of one House can be accommodated in their own House. This will allow simultaneous running of both Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha.” Many Opposition MPs have requested Naidu and Speaker Om Birla to curtail the proceedings in view of the upcoming assembly elections, people aware of the matter said on Sunday, a day ahead of the resumption of the House. A Parliament official said that government managers as well as many Opposition leaders have requested the Rajya Sabha chairman and Lok Sabha Speaker to cut short the session as leaders of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Congress, Trinamool Congress, Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), Left bloc, Asom Gana Parishad (AGP), All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) and many regional outfits would be busy campaigning for the election. Another senior official said on condition of anonymity that the second half of the session, which starts on Monday, may run for just two weeks. “Elections are starting from March 27. Keeping political considerations in mind, it looks like the session is likely to run for two weeks only,” the official added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/parliament-to-return-to-regular-morning-schedule-after-nearly-a-year-101615199657129.html

On International Women's Day, she said people, during formal and informal engagements, use language in humour and it reinforces the mentality.She gave the example of a very commonly-used Hindi idiom ‘choodiyan pehen ke baithna’, which means a person doesn’t have the courage to face or fight against any wrongdoing. Sitharaman said that such an expression has to be avoided."Language of communication has to be gender-sensitive. We stand up each time for use of the right language. We come across language both formal and informal that doesn't recognise an implicit gender bias. We need to say language needs to be gender-sensitive. We shouldn't encourage such language," Sitharaman said, while addressing a gathering of women members of Parliament and journalists, according to news agency ANI. “Each one of us has to say that we don't accept such language and expressions,” she added.Several politicians on Monday expressed their views in the Rajya Sabha on the lack of leadership roles for women in Parliament. Citing several audit reports in the Upper House, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) member Dr Fauzia Khan said not more than 6 per cent of women had been allotted leadership roles and suggested that one could begin by bringing the legislation on 33 per cent of women in both the Rajya Sabha and the Lok Sabha.Echoing her concern, Shiv Sena MP Priyanka Chaturvedi raised a demand for 50 per cent women reservation in Parliament and assembly. “Twenty-four years ago, we proposed a 33 per cent reservation for women in Parliament. Today, 24 years later, we should raise this to 50 per cent reservation for women in Parliament and assembly,” she said.International Women’s day is observed every year on March 8. Started by the United Nations in the year 1977, the day champions the achievements of women in the fields of politics, economy, art and culture etc. Each year, a theme is designated for celebration.

08-03-2021||India||Everyday 4 child victims of sexual abuse denied justice, study finds||Everyday four child victims of sexual offences are denied justice due to closure of their cases by police because of insufficient evidence, according to a new study.The 'Police case disposal pattern: An enquiry into the cases filed under POCSO Act, 2012' by Kailash Satyarthi Children's Foundation (KSCF), is an analysis of pattern of disposal of POCSO cases by police from 2017 to 2019 and is based on the data and information published by the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB).The study has been released on the occasion of International Women's Day."It has been observed that between 2017 and 2019, there has been an increase in the number of cases that have been closed by the police after investigation without filing the chargesheet," the study pointed out.As the data shows, sexual crimes are increasing in the country over the years."While the government recognised the need for a special law and introduced a special legislation to deal with crimes against children viz., Prevention of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 (POCSO), it is disappointing to see its poor implementation on the ground," the study noted.As many as 3,000 POCSO cases registered and investigated fail to reach court for a fair trial every year and four child victims of sexual abuse are denied justice every day due to the closure of their cases by police because of insufficient evidence or lack of a clue, the study said."It has further been revealed from the NCRB data that in a large number (two-fifths) of POCSO cases which were disposed- off/closed by the police without charge sheeting the reason cited was 'cases true but insufficient evidence, or untraced, or no clue'," it said.In 2019, 43 per cent of cases were closed by police on this ground as per the final reports filed in court, the study said."This is higher than 2017 and 2018. Amongst other reasons, false reporting was the second most prominent reason for closure of POCSO cases, however closure of cases on this ground has reduced over the years from 40 per cent in 2017 to 33 per cent in 2019," the study said.Also, another analysis of the POCSO cases for the same period ( 2017 to 2019) by KSCF reveals that there is an urgent need for courts to expedite the justice delivery mechanism as victims of as many as 89 per cent of the cases of child sexual abuse were awaiting justice at the end of 2019."The backlog of cases pending investigation is also increasing from year to year as the number of cases whose investigation is completed in a year is lesser than the number of cases in which chargesheets are filed. This gap demonstrates that police are not devoting adequate resources to deal with these grave crimes," it said.The study has revealed 51 per cent of cases under POCSO are being registered in Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Delhi."This brings out the need for social interventions in these states for better protection of children both within their homes and the society," it said.The conviction rate in POCSO cases in these states is between 30 per cent and 64 per cent, which needs improvement through better presentation of cases in courts as effective detection and conviction are the measures for prevention of a crime, it said.One of the important facts is that in cases where the victims belong to the poor and marginalised communities, their chances of turning hostile during the trial and resiling from the facts in the FIR are high as such victims are subject to both coercion and inducements, the study noted.This happens especially in the cases where the accused is either a family member or a rich and powerful person, it said.“To fill the gaps and address the challenges in implementation of POCSO Act effectively, it is recommended that all the cases registered under POCSO must be closely supervised by the Districts Superintendent of Police and/or Deputy Commissioner of Police,” it said.“At this point of time, there is also a need for a dedicated unit in each district/Police Commissioner for investigating cases relating to sexual offences committed against children," it added.The study recommended that police officers posted in this unit should be specially trained and sensitised and have the correct psychological bent of mind needed to deal with the trauma that women and child victims face."There is also a need for more Fast Track Special Courts (FTSCs) exclusively to try POCSO cases in view of the huge pendency of these cases in courts across the country," it said.

As a society, we need to destigmatize women's roles,” Manhas said on International Women’s Day.Captain Manhas, a first officer of Air India, was part of the longest direct route flight from San Francisco to Bengaluru which flew over the North Pole with the all-women pilot team, covering a distance of about 16,000 kilometres. Besides Captain Manhas other pilots of the crew were Captain Zoya Aggarwal, Captain Papagari Thanmai and Captain Akansha Sonaware. The inaugural flight AI176 departed from San Francisco in the USA at 8.30pm on January 9 and landed at the Kempegowda International Airport in Bengaluru at 3.45am on January 11.The crew was lauded by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. “What can be more exciting than that for a citizen. It was an exciting experience since it was never done before. It took almost 17 hours to reach here," Manhas added.When asked about whether she or any of her team members in the flight ever mulled over having at least one male member in the flight, Manhas said that such a thought never came in her or in her team members’ mind. “On Women’s Day, I used to be part of a women crew flight and I always enjoy these flights. I have no fear as my training from Air India and MP Flying School was very good,” she said.Manhas comes from the village of Akalpur on the outskirts of Jammu. She completed her Class 12 from Delhi Public School and then began her aviation training in Madhya Pradesh Flying Club of Indore.

As per the initial estimations based on fixed prices, the GSDP has contracted by 2.6% in comparison with that of 2019-20," Yediyurappa said in his budget speech on Monday.He added that the state and central government's tax collections are less than budgetary estimates that have led to reduced share of taxes to states."Hence the share of the state in central taxes has come down to ₹20,053 crore in the revised estimates from the budgetary estimates of ₹28,591 crore in 2020-21," according to Yediyurappa's budget speech.He added that the rise in debts will also wipe out any hopes of achieving the 14% growth target projection made last year."The budget of the state was never made in such a difficult situation previously. In spite of this, I am presenting this budget with positive thoughts having the aim of achieving the developmental dreams," he added.Yediyurappa, however, did not levy any taxes on the common man."I am not willing to put the burden of additional taxes on the common people," he said, referring to diesel and petrol.The government reduced stamp duty for first registration of apartments valued between ₹35-45 lakh from 5%to 3%.The agricultural sector has been allocated ₹31,028 crore. Yediyurappa has allocated ₹62,150 crore for welfare and inclusive growth sector, ₹29,688 crore for education, ₹27,386 crore for urban development, ₹21,181 crore for water resources, ₹16,516 crore for energy sector, ₹16,036 core for rural development and panchayati raj.Yediyurappa has provided ₹52,529 crore for providing stimulus to economic activities. Bengaluru has been allocated ₹7,795 crore.Frequent floods, droughts, unreliable rain and the Covid-19 pandemic had exacerbated Karnataka's severe fund crunch.The revenue deficit is estimated to be ₹15134 crore and fiscal deficit is expected to be ₹59240 crore, which is 3.48% of the GSDP."The total liabilities at the end of 2021-22 is estimated to be ₹4,57, 899 crore, which is 26.9% of the GSDP," according to the budget.The 2020-21 budget had stated that the government would borrow around ₹60,000 crore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-bs-yediyurappa-s-karnataka-budget-borrowings-see-sharp-increase-101615192740047.html
08-03-2021||India||Karnataka government slashes stamp duty on low-cost apartments||Karnataka chief minister BS Yediyurappa on Monday proposed a 2% cut in stamp duty for apartments valued between ₹35-45 lakh in the state budget 2021-22."To promote affordable housing, the stamp duty for the first registration of apartments valued between ₹35 and ₹45 lakh is proposed to be reduced to 3% from 5%," he said on Monday.The cut comes at a time when real estate companies in Karnataka and especially in Bengaluru have requested for some relief to boost sales of unsold apartments in India's IT capital.The Covid-19 pandemic had exacerbated sluggish sales in the housing sector. The slowdown had led to poor sales and piling up inventory in the state capital. The target for stamps and registrations remains unchanged at ₹12, 655 crore, according to the budget document.Yediyurappa has also kept excise rates unchanged after increasing rates on liquor twice last year.The Yediyurappa government had also increased duty on liquor twice last year, registering a hike between 17-25%. Excise has been one of the biggest sources of revenue for Karnataka.The target for excise was increased to ₹24,580 crore from around ₹22,700 crore last year.The state has already collected ₹20,900 crore in excise revenue at the end of February.In last year's budget, Yediyurappa had also resorted to increasing the rate on petrol from 32% to 35% and on diesel from 21% to 24%."The year 2020-21, due to Covid-19 pandemic, has caused untold miseries to the general public. I am not willing to put the burden of additional taxes on the common people," he said without raising state taxes on diesel and petrol.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-government-slashes-stamp-duty-on-low-cost-apartments-101615192044944.html

Maharashtra has the highest weekly positivity rate with 11.13 per cent, the government said.The number of active cases in the country reached 1,88,747 on Monday and it is 1.68 per cent of the total infections.Meanwhile, 18 states and Union territories have not reported any Covid-19 deaths in the last 24 hours.These are Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Chandigarh, Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu, Goa, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Ladakh, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Odisha, Puducherry, Rajasthan, Sikkim and Tripura.The ministry said that nearly 2.10 crore vaccine doses had been administered through 3,76,633 sessions, as per the provisional report till 7 am on Monday.These include 69,85,911 healthcare workers (first dose), 35,47,548 healthcare workers (second dose), 66,09,537 frontline workers (first dose) and 2,13,559 frontline workers (second dose), 4,80,661 beneficiaries aged more than 45 years with specific comorbidities (first dose) and 31,51,794 beneficiaries aged more than 60 years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/8625-new-covid-cases-in-6-states-govt-101615188103879.html
08-03-2021||India||Maratha reservation: SC seeks states' response on allowing over 50% quota||The Supreme Court on Monday sought responses from all states on whether the 50% ceiling limit on reservation needs to be reconsidered.The ceiling was imposed by a nine-judge Constitution Bench in the Indira Sahwney case in 1992, wherein the court strictly held that reservation cannot exceed 50%. However, the bench did indicate that in exceptional circumstances, reservation could be extended.On Monday a five-judge bench, hearing a challenge to a law passed by Maharashtra in 2018 providing reservation to Marathas, said that it will examine whether the 50% rule laid by the 1992 decision needs to be reconsidered.The bench comprising justices Ashok Bhushan, LN Rao, SA Nazeer, Hemant Gupta and S Ravindra Bhat issued a notice to all states in this regard.Also Read | Is Haryana’s new reservation law constitutionally tenable?The bench also asked states to respond to a 2018 Constitution (102nd amendment) Act brought about by Parliament, which gave constitutional recognition to National Commission for Backward Classes. Article 342A was introduced via the amendment, by which the competence of states to make laws on reservation for Backward classes was taken away.The bench said, “in view of the question of seminal importance on Article 342A, states have to be given opportunity to make their submissions.” The states were asked to make brief notes of submissions on whether they considered Article 342A as against the federal structure of the Constitution. The states were also asked to reply on whether Article 342A abridged their rights to create reservations for backward classes under Articles 15 and 16 of Constitution.The request to seek a response from all states was raised by Maharashtra ,which has maintained that it is justified in exceeding the 50% ceiling in the state to benefit Marathas.The 2018 Maratha quota law originally provided 16% reservation to Marathas and came after years of protests by the community. In June 2019, the Bombay high court trimmed the quantum of the quota to 12% in education and 13% in jobs. In its order, the high court said the 50% cap could be breached in exceptional circumstancesRepresenting Maharashtra, senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi submitted that before considering the law that involves the interpretation of Article 342A and the Indira Sahwney decision all states must be heard.Rohatgi said, “All states need to be heard as Article 342A takes away the legislative competence of states to make laws for backward classes under Articles 15 and 16 in education and employment.”Attorney General KK Venugopal agreed that states will have to be heard as the 102nd amendment deals with the state’s power to legislate on reservation for backward classes after the 102nd amendment introduced National Commission for Backward Classes.The court then agreed to have all states on board.The bench will now consider the law passed by Maharashtra in light of the larger questions of law on which all states will be heard.The next hearing in the case will be on March 15 and proceed on a day-to-day basis. The bench expects to wrap up the hearings by March 25.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-reservation-case-supreme-court-seeks-responses-from-all-states-101615188197233.html

This court has always given the largest respect to women. We never asked the accused to marry the girl. We asked him ‘Are you going to marry her’. There was complete misreporting of what we said,” observed the CJI, as he heard a petition by a 14-year-old rape survivor who has sought termination of her 26-week pregnancy.Reacting to the controversy that flared up after his comments attracted criticism from a section of lawyers as well as rights groups, justice Bobde pointed out that his questions to the lawyer for the accused were in the facts of that particular case but there was misreporting by the media.Also Read | SC to hear Kerala’s plea against leasing of Trivandrum airport to AdaniSolicitor general Tushar Mehta, who was present during the proceedings, supported the CJI, saying the court’s poser during the hearing on March 1 were completely in sync with Section 165 of the Evidence Act, which empowered judges to ask questions in order to discover or to obtain proper proof of relevant facts in a case.Mehta said that the court’s questions were justified in the facts of that case but the comments were widely reported out of the context. At this, the CJI said: “Our reputation is always at the hands of the Bar.”The plea by the minor, who underwent medical examination at a hospital in Haryana as regards to feasibility of the termination of her pregnancy, was adjourned to Friday on a request by her counsel VK Biju.After going through the medical report which was submitted confidentially, the bench, which also included justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian, said that it would wish to speak to the minor’s parents.When advocate Biju said that the Supreme Court had been very generous to the girl, the CJI replied: “It is good to hear that. We have heard the exact opposite in the last two weeks.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/remarks-misreported-court-has-highest-regard-for-women-cji-bobde-101615187836601.html

08-03-2021||India||Arthritis drug cuts death risk by half in severe Covid-19 patients: Study||The use of the immunosuppressive rheumatoid arthritis drug tocilizumab when given to only those with severe Covid-19 can halve the number of deaths, showed a subset analysis of the study that was published in Lancet Respiratory Medicine on Thursday. However, the drug did not result in any significant improvement in markers like the requirement for ventilation, organ failure, ICU stay, or deaths when data for all patients—moderate and severe—hospitalised was considered, found a randomised control trial held at 11 sites across India.“Millions were wasted on the indiscriminate use of the drug as it was not clear at what stage of the disease it had to be administered. Now, we know that it can help only those who have either come in with severe disease or progress on to severe disease—patients who are on supplemental oxygen, non-invasive ventilation, invasive ventilation, or in the ICU without ventilation,” said Dr Arvinder Soin, national lead investigator for the COVINTOC trial. Also Read | India’s Covid-19 tally rises after 18,599 fresh cases recorded in last 24 hoursThe researchers have gone by the union health ministry’s definition of “severe disease”—a respiratory rate of more than 30 per minute (normal is 12 to 16 per minute), oxygen saturation of less than 90% (normal is 95 to 100%), or acute respiratory distress syndrome or septic shock. The first eight to ten days of Covid-19 is the infectious phase when the replication of the virus leads to fever, pneumonia, breathing difficulty, and some gastric symptoms among others. After that, it is the immune response going in overdrive resulting in a cytokine storm—a condition where the body’s immune system attacks its organs and tissues—that leads to most Covid-19 deaths. The doctors had thought that an immunosuppressive drug such as tocilizumab could control this rogue immune response. The study also showed 12% of patients had disease progression at day 28 in the tocilizumab group as compared to 18% in the standard care group. The number of adverse events—which could range from a simple fever to acute respiratory distress syndrome and death—was higher in the tocilizumab group. “However, the difference was not statistically significant. The rate of severe adverse events such as respiratory distress, cardiac events, and infections were also almost similar across the groups assuring us of the safety of the drug,” said Dr Soin. Since the drug is immunosuppressive,doctors were concerned that it could lead to more secondary infections.“This is the first peer-reviewed published study that has plugged the knowledge gap on when the drug should be administered. Incidentally, two yet-to-be published major studies—RECOVERY trial from the UK and REMAP-CAP—have revealed similar findings. This has prompted the UK to include the drug in their standard of care; in India it has been in use as an experimental therapy,” said Dr Soin. The study was conducted between May and October 2020 with 180 trial participants randomly assigned to the groups given standard care along with tocilizumab. “We had to include drugs such as remdesivir and steroids in our standard care after the trial started as the government treatment protocol changed. However, the number of people who received such interventions is well matched across both the arms of our study and hence it is not a confounding factor,” he said. Administration of off-label drugs (using a medicine for a condition it is not specified for), rapidly evolving understanding of the disease and treatment, and multiple trials competing for recruitment of participants were some of the challenges that the team highlight in the paper.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/arthritis-drug-cuts-death-risk-by-half-in-severe-covid-19-patients-study-101615186516534.html
08-03-2021||India||International Women's Day: Women MPs push for 33% reservation in Parliament||Several women members of Parliament on Monday spoke in Rajya Sabha on the occasion of International Women's Day. During the discussion, MPs highlighted the issue of lack of women representation in leadership roles as they pushed for 33% reservation for women in Parliament. "Many audits have shown that not more than 6% of women have got leadership roles. We must think about it," said National Congress Party's Fauzia Khan. "We can make a beginning by bringing the legislation on 33 per cent reservation of women in Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha," Khan added.She further said that deep-seated historic, cultural and socio-economic barriers prevent women from taking their seat at the decision-making table.Shiv Sena's Priyanka Chaturvedi also spoke about the reservation legislation and suggested that the number should be raised to 50 per cent. "24 years ago, we proposed a 33% reservation for women in Parliament. Today, 24 years later, we should raise this to 50% reservation for women in Parliament and assembly," Chaturvedi said in the Parliament.Chhattisgarh's Chhaya Varma and MP from the Congress party underlined the issue of crime against women and said, while the government has pushed the slogan 'Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao', the high rate of crimes against women tells a very different story."Meanwhile, the Bharatiya Janata Party's Sonal Mansingh demanded the celebration of International Men's Day if we are celebrating women's day. "I demand that International Men's Day should also be celebrated," she said.The Women's Reservation Bill is the pending bill in the Parliament that seeks amendment in the Constitution of India to reserve one-third of all seats in the Lok Sabha and in all state legislatures for women. The bill was passed in Rajya sabha in 2010 and is pending in the lower house of Parliament.As per the proposed criteria, the Lok Sabha seats will be reserved on a rotational basis. One seat will be reserved once in every three general elections, the bill also mandates.International Women's Day is celebrated on March 8 of every year. It is a day to celebrate women's achievements in all areas like social, economic, cultural and political over the years. This year, the United Nations decided 'Women in leadership: Achieving an equal future in a Covid-19 world' as the theme for celebrations. The theme was decided amid reports that Covid-19 pandemic has widened the gap between women and men. According to a report by the UN, women are nearly twice as likely than men to lose their jobs during the Covid-19 crisis.In 2020, the World Economic Forum listed India at 122 out of 153 countries when it comes to women's representation in parliament, in their Global Gender Gap Report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/international-women-s-day-women-mps-push-for-33-reservation-in-parliament-bill-101615185297685.html

08-03-2021||India||Is Haryana’s new reservation law constitutionally tenable?||Haryana government’s new law to reserve 75% of private sector jobs in the state, till a certain salary slab, only for local candidates, has triggered a controversy. The decision fulfils a key election promise of the ruling coalition, with Haryana joining a growing group of states that reserve jobs for local candidates. The Haryana State Employment of Local Candidates Act, 2021 provides for reservation for a “local candidate”, which has been defined under the law as someone “domiciled in State of Haryana”. Under the law, every employer is required to employ 75% “local candidates” for posts where the gross monthly salary is not more than ₹50,000. The law is set to confront serious legal challenges once its constitutionality is challenged before a constitutional court—the Supreme Court or the Punjab and Haryana high court. Here are some pertinent issues at the centre of the controversy around Haryana’s 2021 Act: What are the provisions in the Constitution that enable reservation/quota?Part III in the Indian Constitution earmarks fundamental rights for citizens and all other persons while defining the corresponding duty of the State. Article 14 guarantees equality before the law and equal protection of law to all persons. Similarly, Articles 15(1) and 15(2) also prohibit the state from discriminating against any citizen on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex, place of birth. Also Read | Open to inputs from industry in framing rules on pvt sector job quota: DushyantBut clauses (3) to (5) of Article 15 empower the state to provide for positive discrimination in favour of the grossly underrepresented and neglected sections of the society in order to promote substantive equality. Article 15(3) empowers the state to make special provisions for women and children while Article 15(4) authorises the state to make special provisions for the advancement of socially and educationally backwards or SC/STs. Article 15(5) goes one step further and says the state can reserve admission into education institutions, including private schools or colleges, whether or not aided by the government. Similarly, Article 16(1) lays down that the state cannot discriminate against any citizen in the matters of employment. Likewise, Article 16(2) too makes it clear that “no citizen shall, on grounds only of religion, race, caste, sex, descent, place of birth, residence or any of them, be ineligible for, or discriminated against in respect or, any employment or office under the State”. However, clause 3 of Article 16 allows Parliament to make any law with residence qualifications necessary for government jobs, thus introducing the domicile-based preferential treatment. Article 16(4) also allows the state to reserve employment for any backward class of citizens, which in the opinion of the state, is not adequately represented in services. This opens the door for the reservations of Other Backward Classes (OBCs). Article 16(4A) was incorporated, permitting reservation in promotions but restricting the same to Scheduled Caste (SC) and Scheduled Tribes (ST). After the Constitution (103rd Amendment) Act, 2019, clauses 6 and Articles 15 and 16 have been inserted to provide a further 10% reservation in jobs and educational institutions for economically backward sections in the general category. These are the relevant provisions in the Constitution that seek to balance the right to equality for all citizens with the right of the state to legislate for reservation in favour of backward classes. At the same time, the Supreme Court, in Triloki Nath Tiku & Anr Vs State of Jammu & Kashmir, 1966, made it clear that the issue of determination by the state as to whether a particular class of citizens is backward or not is a justiciable one. It said that the state is not the final word on identifying a backward class for providing reservation and that a court can overturn any such determination if it is based on irrelevant consideration or manifests an abuse of power. Can courts direct the state to provide reservation to SC/ST or backward classes? No. It has been held in a body of judgments of the Supreme Court that directions cannot be issued to the state to give reservation to any class of citizens. Starting 1963, several rulings have emphasised that Articles 15(4) and 16(4) are enabling provisions and do not confer any right on SC/STs, OBCs or any other group of citizens to demand reservation as a matter of right, and thus, no such directive can be issued to the state. In MR Balaji Vs State of Mysore, 1963, a five-judge bench had underscored: “It is necessary to emphasise that Article 15(4) like Article 16(4) is an enabling provision, it does not impose an obligation, but merely leaves it to the discretion of the appropriate government to take suitable action, if necessary.” This judgment quashed the order of the state of Mysore, providing as much as 75% reservation in educational institutions to all communities except Brahmins. It also held that caste cannot be the sole and dominant test for determining social backwardness and the reservation made under Article 15(4) should be reasonable and less than 50%. Another Constitution Bench in CA Rajendran Vs Union of India, 1968, made it amply clear: “Our conclusion therefore is that Article 16(4) does not confer any right on the petitioner and there is no constitutional duty imposed on the government to make reservation for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, either at the initial stage or at the stage of promotion. In other words, Article 16(4) is an enabling provision and confers discretionary power on the State to make a reservation of appointment in favour of backward class of citizens which, in its opinion, is not adequately represented in the services of the State.” A nine-judge bench in the Indra Sawhney case, 1992, ruled that the power conferred on the state to give reservation to backward classes is to be exercised only if “in the opinion of the State” that there is no adequate representation in the services under the state. This judgment, while dealing with the issues relating to reservation for other backward classes (OBCs) also put a cap of 50% on reservation—a rule that holds the field till now. Again, in M Nagaraj Vs Union of India, 2006, a five-judge bench ruled that the ceiling of 50%, the concept of creamy layer and the compelling reasons, namely, backwardness, inadequacy of representation and overall administrative efficiency are all constitutional requirements without which the structure of equality of opportunity in Article 16 would collapse. It upheld validity of Article 16(4A) but clarified in the same breath that the state is not bound to make reservation for SC/ST in matter of promotions. Both the judgments in Indra Sawhney and M Nagaraj have underscored that reservation cannot exceed beyond 50% unless there are “extraordinary reasons” to justify why this ceiling has to be breached. Sufficient reasons must provide the necessity to go beyond 50%, said the judgments, which have recently been applied by the Supreme Court to stay the implementation of the Maratha quota in Maharashtra since it took the total percentage of reservation in excess of 50%. The final decision is yet to come through. In Suresh Chand Gautam Vs State of UP, 2016, the Supreme Court held that no direction can be given by the court to the state government to collect quantifiable data on the basis of which a decision to provide reservation should be taken, let alone the order to make reservation. Most recently, in Mukesh Kumar & Anr Vs State of Uttarakhand, 2020, the apex court reiterated that the state cannot be directed to provide reservations for appointment in public posts nor are they bound to make reservation for SC/ST in matters of promotions. These judgments bring home the point that although the state has been given the authority to provide reservation, such decisions are amenable to judicial review and the Supreme Court, in appropriate cases, has gone ahead to even strike down some of these reservation policies. Can a law be framed for reservation on the basis of domicile? Yes, but only by the Parliament. Article 16(3) in the Constitution empowers Parliament to provide domicile-based reservation in public employment and jobs with local or any other authority under a state or a Union Territory. Exercising this power, in 1957, the Centre passed The Public Employment (Requirement as To Residence) Act to repeal all existing laws in a state or a Union Territory that prescribed requirements as to residence (domicile) for public employment. The Centre, however, reserved its right to lay down rules in respect of certain classes of public employment in certain areas of some states such as Manipur, Tripura, Andhra Pradesh and Himachal Pradesh. But this power with the Central government is also not unfettered, as was made clear by a judgment of the Supreme Court in 1969 when a Constitution bench of the Supreme Court in AVS Narasimha Rao Vs State of AP declared that the law enacted by Parliament under Article 16 (3), making a special provision for domicile within the Telangana region of the state of Andhra Pradesh for the purpose of public employment, was ultra vires (without power under) the Constitution. It ruled that even Parliament cannot use the power under Article 16(3) to provide for domicile-based reservation in a particular part of the state and that the entire state must be the venue for residential qualification.Do state governments have any specific power to make laws/policies for domicile-based reservation?No. State governments have no such power to pass laws directly on domicile-based reservation. The Supreme Court has decried this practice in several judgments. When the reservations of certain percentage of seats in medical colleges in favour of candidates from rural areas was sought to be justified on economic considerations, a three-judge bench of the Supreme Court, in state of Uttar Pradesh Vs Pradip Tandon, emphatically rejected the plea. It held: “The reservation for rural areas cannot be sustained on the ground that the rural areas represent socially and educationally backward classes of citizens. This reservation appears to be made for majority population of the State. Eighty per cent of the population of the State cannot be a homogeneous class. Poverty in rural areas cannot be the basis of classification to support reservation for rural areas. The incident of birth in rural areas is made the basic qualification. No reservation can be made on the basis of place of birth as that would offend Art. 15”. In 1979, in Ramana Dayaram Shetty Vs International Airport Authority of India & Ors, the apex court stated that the power or discretion of the government in the matter of grant of largess including award of jobs, contracts, quotas, licences etc., must be confined and structured by rational, relevant and non-discriminatory standard or norm and if the government departs from standards or norms in any particular case or cases, the action of the government would be liable to be struck down. In Dr Pradeep Jain Vs Union of India, 1984, the top court dealt specifically with the issue of domicile-based reservation, noting that to regard an individual from one state as an outsider in another state “would be to deny him his constitutional rights and to derecognise the essential unity and integrity of the country by treating it as if it were a mere conglomeration of independent States.” “It would appear that residential requirement would be unconstitutional as a condition of eligibility for employment or appointment to an office under the State which also covers an office under any local or other authority within the State or any corporation, such as a public sector corporation, which is an instrumentality or agency of the State,” it further held. The court, in this judgment, also discussed the “sons of the soil” concept while regretting that the Supreme Court initially allowed “sons of the soil” demands to develop claiming special treatment on the basis of residence in the concerned State, because recognising and conceding such demands had a populist appeal. “The result is that ‘sons of the soil’ claims, though not altogether illegitimate if confined within reasonable bounds, are breaking asunder the unity and integrity of the nation by fostering and strengthening narrow parochial loyalties based on language and residence within a state.” In Nidamarti Maheshkumar Vs State of Maharashtra, 1986, when region-wise classification for admissions to medical colleges was sought to be defended on the ground that Vidharbha and Marathwada regions are backward as compared to Pune and Bombay regions, the apex court declined to accept such contention, saying it is not possible to categorise the regions within the jurisdiction of the various universities as backward or advanced as if they were exclusive categories. In Sunanda Reddy Vs State of Andhra Pradesh, 1995, the Supreme Court affirmed the observation in Pradeep Jain to strike down a state government policy that gave 5% extra weightage to candidates who had studied with Telugu as the medium of instruction. In Govind A Mane Vs State of Maharashtra, 2000, the top court quashed the state government’s decision to distribute seats district-wise for admission to B.Ed course, saying that such allocation based on residence would be violative of Article 14 (equality) of the Constitution when it fails to put forth any material to show the nexus between such distribution and the object sought to be achieved. Similarly, in Kailash Chand Sharma Vs State of Rajasthan, 2002, the court held that “measures taken by the State on considerations of localism are not sanctioned by the constitutional mandate of equality”. “Attempts to prefer candidates of a local area in the State were nipped in the bud by this Court since long past. We would like to reiterate that residence by itself be it be within a State, region, district or lesser area within a district cannot be a ground to accord preferential treatment or reservation, save as provided in Article 16(3),” highlighted this judgment. In reserving jobs for “local candidates,” the Haryana’s new law, on the face of it, falls foul of the principles evolved by the Supreme Court in catena of judgments that have developed over last 60-odd years. This will be the prime legal hurdle the state government shall face once the law is challenged in a constitutional court. How have some states reserved jobs, seats in state assemblies for the locals? Article 371 of the Constitution lays down “special provisions” for 11 states, including six states of the Northeast. In view of the special circumstances of individual states, Article 371 includes a wide range of specific safeguards that are deemed important for these states. Under Article 371D, Andhra Pradesh government can organise “any class or classes of posts in a civil service of, or any class or classes of civil posts under, the State into different local cadres for different parts of the State”. There are similar powers vis-à-vis admissions in educational institutions. Other clauses in Article 371 talk about reserving seats in the Hills area in the Manipur assembly and Sikkim assembly; protection of customs and practices of local inhabitants of Nagaland and Mizoram. Some states have circumvented the prohibition under Article 16(2) by providing for institutional reservations in technical and medical education wherein certain number of seats can be reserved for students passing the PUC or pre-medical examination of the same university or clearing the qualifying examination from the school system of the educational hinterland of the medical colleges in the state, as was ratified by the Supreme Court in Dr Pradeep Jain’s case. In addition to this, some states have bypassed requirements for Articles 16(2) and 14 by including local language as a chief criterion, given the fact that some states conduct official business in their regional languages. Prescription of local language indirectly ensures that local citizens are preferred for jobs. States such as Maharashtra, West Bengal and Tamil Nadu require a language test. As on date, several states have enacted laws to provide reservation for their local residents in the private sector. These states include Maharashtra (up to 80% quota), Karnataka (75%), Andhra Pradesh (75%) and Madhya Pradesh (70%). But validity of most of these laws are pending challenged before the Supreme Court and high courts and an authoritative ruling is awaited. Can a state make it legally contingent for a private sector firm to reserve jobs for local residents?The Act mandates all private establishments in Haryana to provide 75% of new jobs to local candidates. Under Article 19(1)(g), all citizens have a fundamental right to practice any profession, or to carry on any occupation, trade or business as a fundamental right. By mandating private institutions to employ a certain set of candidates, the Act constricts their right to carry on their occupation freely, which will be a major leg of challenge to the law. Following a series of judgments until 2005 when PA Inamdar case ruled that the state cannot insist on private educational institutions which do not receive aid from the state to implement reservation on any criterion except merit, the 93rd Constitutional Amendment Act was passed in 2005 to allow the state to make provisions for the advancement of socially and educationally backward class of citizens or SC/ST in matters relating to admission in private educational institutions. However, the amendment does not give power to the state to make such provisions for employment in private institutions and therefore, any law in this regard lacks a constitutional support. The private sector firms are going to cite the constraints arising out of this legal obligation to buttress that the law effectively interferes with their constitutional rights to carry on their trade freely, especially when they do not receive any sops from the government and the law also fails on constitutional touchstone. A state law that prima facie exercises a power exclusively within the domain of the Parliament under Article 16(3), breaches 50% ceiling on reservation, and also interferes with the constitutional right of citizens to conduct business or trade has be tested on the anvils on the constitutional and legal principles. The Supreme Court must pronounce a commanding judgment to settle the issue once and for all.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/is-haryana-s-new-reservation-law-constitutionally-tenable-101615180936227.html
08-03-2021||India||Women protesters join ongoing stir demanding repeal of 'black laws'||Thousands of women farmers, students and activists are gathering at Tikri border near Delhi where a protest has been going on against the Centre's three farm laws. These women will take part in the protest on International Women's Day on Monday."We urge the central government to roll back the three black laws," said a woman protester who reached Tikri border on Monday morning. The women protesters will be present at other border points too - Ghazipur and Singhu.International Women's Day (IWD) celebrates the social, economic, cultural and political achievements of women. It also marks a call to action for accelerating gender parity.“To celebrate Women's Day, the stage will be managed by women, and the speakers too will be women. And there will be a small march at Singhu border. We are expecting more women to join at different protest sites,” farmer leader Kavita Kurugranthy, also a member of the Samkyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM), told news agency PTI on Sunday.The SKM said it expects 15,000 women protesters at Tikri and 4,000 at Singhu on Monday.The farmers have been protesting near Delhi demanding withdrawal of the laws passed in September. The agitation, launched on November 26 last year, has completed 100 days but the farmers have vowed to continue "as long as it takes" for the Centre to listen to their demands.The government has promised to put these laws on hold for 18 months, and have also held 11 rounds of talks with the farmers but no breakthrough has been achieved. The farmers have said they won't ened their protest until the laws are withdrawn.The government on its past has times and again said that these laws are histric and will benefit the small farmers. One of the key changes these laws offer is freedom to farmers to sell their produce other than notified marketplaxces (mandis). The protesters say this will end the minimum support price (MSP) system, thereby putting them at the mercy of big corporate houses.The Centre has assured that the MSP will continue, but the farmers want a legal guarantee on it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/international-women-s-day-women-protesters-join-ongoing-stir-demanding-repeal-of-black-laws-101615179795592.html

08-03-2021||India||India’s Covid-19 vaccine drive jumps four-fold as PM Modi is inoculated||Following a sluggish start, India’s Covid-19 vaccination drive -- one of the world’s biggest -- has jumped nearly four-fold after the country opened it up to more people and got a crucial public endorsement from the inoculation of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.Almost 21 million shots have been administered in India so far, up from 5.4 million a month ago, according to data compiled as of Sunday by Bloomberg and Johns Hopkins University. The number of doses per 100 people has also climbed to 1.56 from 0.41. A record 1.6 million Indians received a Covid-19 vaccine on Saturday, data show.After an initially lukewarm response -- due in part to the controversial approval of a homegrown vaccine before it had completed clinical trials -- the vaccination drive gained some momentum after Modi took the injection on March 1 and urged others to follow suit. India also openedthe rollout to all citizens above 60 years of age and those 45 and older with co-morbidities, either for free from a state center or for a fee of as much as 250 rupees ($3.40) at private hospitals.Some of the biggest companies operating in the country have said they will cover the costs of vaccination for their employees and families, including Accenture Plc, Infosys Ltd. and Reliance Industries Ltd., owned by Asia’s richest man Mukesh Ambani. “With your support, we will soon be able to put this pandemic behind us,” Nita Ambani, a director at Reliance and wife of Mukesh, said in a letter to employees seen by Bloomberg.“A large number of people are coming,” Azad Moopen, the chairman of Dubai-based Aster DM Healthcare Ltd., which operates 13 private hospitals in India, said in an interview Friday. But there’s still a “huge gap” to be bridged for India to reach its vaccination targets.Confidence BoostAlong with AstraZeneca Plc’s shot, India has also authorized the use of Covaxin, a vaccine developed by Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech International Ltd., which initially caused hesitancy among medical and frontline workers. It was approved in early January before it had concluded final-stage human testing.Bharat Biotech announced earlier this month that Covaxin showed a strong efficacy of 81% in those without prior infection after a second dose. Modi was also injected with the indigenously developed Covaxin -- a move that may have helped shore up confidence.India will need all these tailwinds to meet its target of inoculating about a quarter of its population by August. Maintaining the momentum in vaccination is not always easy, as Hong Kong’s experience shows. Also as demand rises, supply shortages may arise in India unless bottlenecks are eased quickly.The head of the world’s biggest vaccine maker, Adar Poonawalla of the Serum Institute of India Ltd. -- which is producing hundreds of millions of AstraZeneca’s Covid vaccine in the country -- on Thursday warned of impending global shortages due to a U.S. law blocking the export of certain key items such as bags and filters.Open MoreHome to the world’s the second-worst Covid outbreak, India will also need to open its vaccination program more widely if it has to curb further waves. This may mean allowing younger Indians to be inoculated and giving hospitals permission to directly purchase vaccines from the manufacturers instead of queuing up for state-procured supplies.“The government should involve the private sector very actively,” said Moopen. “The manufacturers have huge stocks with them.”A wider vaccination program is also key to sustaining the nascent economic recovery and retail boom across India, as people flock to shops and restaurants.“Growth over the next few months could be driven by pent-up services demand, particularly with the vaccine rollout progressing,” HSBC Holdings Plc researchers, including Chief India Economist Pranjul Bhandari, wrote in a report on Friday. “Having said that, risks cannot be ignored,” including “the sudden surge in new pandemic cases in a few states.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indias-covid-19-vaccine-drive-jumps-four-fold-as-pm-modi-is-inoculated-101615177569542.html

With this, the country's overall tally reached 11,229,398.The cases in the country have been rising for the third day in a row, with the active cases witnessing a surge for the sixth consecutive day.India’s total active caseload stood at 1.88 lakh after six states across the country reported a surge in daily Covid-19 cases. Maharashtra, Kerala, Punjab, Karnataka, Gujarat and Tamil Nadu are among the active hotspots in the country, driving the daily surge in caseload.The number of people who have recuperated from the disease surged to 1,08,82,798 which translates to a national Covid-19 recovery rate of 96.91%, while the case fatality rate stands at 1.41%.Union health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan on Sunday said that the country is in the end game of the disease outbreak in the country."To succeed at this stage, politics should be kept out of the Covid-19 vaccination drive," the health minister said. He said that people should trust the science behind vaccines and ensure that their near and dear ones get vaccinated on time.As of Sunday, Maharashtra continued to report the highest daily new cases at 10,187. It is followed by Kerala with 2,791 and Punjab with 1,159 new cases.

08-03-2021||India||Healthcare to generate jobs, govt to focus on skilling for employment abroad||The Union government is collaborating with a clutch of countries to draw up the parameters for imparting skill training in the heath sector that is expected to generate more jobs worldwide following the changes imposed by the Covid-19 pandemic, said a person aware of the details. The work of imparting skills is carried out by the ministry of skill development and entrepreneurship (MSDE), which has identified 300,000 jobs in the health sector alone in countries such Australia, Germany, Canada, Japan, Sweden and Singapore. “Since the pandemic has increased the scope of opportunities in the health sector, the ministry is working with individual countries to work out equivalence of qualifications,” said the person cited above. Also Read | 6 states continue to record spike in Covid cases: Centre“There are parameters that need to be worked out for workers to be deemed eligible. For instance, the skills of an operation theatre technician may vary; what is suited for the US may not fit in with the requirements in Sweden. So, we have to draw up equivalence of skills,” the person said. Blue and grey collar jobs for skilled workers have also been identified in a dozen-odd countries, including the Gulf, United States, Singapore and Switzerland. Officials expect 2.63 million job opportunities in the Gulf counties in the next five years; 300,000 in UK and a million jobs in New Zealand, US and Japan. For future collaboration with countries in the health sector, Indian embassies have been asked to organise webinars of MSDE with major health sector employers in those countries; placement agencies have been asked to furnish details of country and sector-wise demand of health workers and virtual meetings will be organised between employers or employer association of the health sector and professionals. Since job requirements are not uniform, the ministry will bilaterally work out the details of skilling needs with the destination countries. For instance, there are opportunities in sectors such as construction and related activities in the Gulf countries while health care workers and workforce that can work in sectors such as retail and delivery are more in demand in the European countries; so, country-specific requirements will be addressed. For people with technical skills in sectors such as healthcare, management, financial services and technologies the key destinations are USA, Canada, UK, EU and Australia. For skilled and unskilled workers in key sectors such as construction, retail and drivers the key destinations are the Middle East and the Gulf countries. “If you look at the sector-wise trend of labour outflow, India’s migrant workforce accounts for 18% of the total manufacturing sector, 14% of the retail sector and 10% of the health and social sector in Europe. In the Middle East, the percentage of Indian workforce in the construction sector is 41% followed by 32% in the retail sector and 11 % and 9% respectively in the domestic work and manufacturing sectors,” said a second functionary. The other sectors that are expected to attract investment are mega retail estate projects, building infrastructure, financial services, social sector, tourism and hospitality and industrial investments. Prof Amitabh Kundu, Distinguished Fellow at Research and Information System for Developing Countries and Co-chairman of the Expert Committee for labour surveys, said a dramatic shift in sectoral priorities is not expected in the long run and there is no need to realign the skilling process to just one sector. “The greater focus on the heath sector may not last for long. After 6 to 8 months, the scenarios will revert to what it was pre-pandemic. There is a need to focus on the unorganised sector, that should get a fair deal,” he said. The National Skill Development Corporation that comes under the ministry has signed memorandum of understanding with eight countries, including Japan, UAE, Sweden, and Russia, for cooperation in the field of vocational education and training.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/healthcare-to-generate-jobs-govt-to-focus-on-skilling-for-employment-abroad-101615174695872.html
08-03-2021||India||Supreme Court to hear Kerala's plea against Centre's move to lease Thiruvananthapuram airport to Adani Enterprises||The Supreme Court will on Monday hear the Kerala government's appeal against the Airport Authority of India's (AAI) decision to lease out Thiruvananthapuram International Airport to Adani Enterprises Limited. The case will be heard by a three-judge bench of Chief Justice of India (CJI) Sharad Arvind Bobde, justices A S Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian.The Kerala government moved the top court last year challenging the AAI's decision. The state-run Kerala State Industrial Development Corporation (KSIDC) participated in the bid held last year but Adani Enterprises quoted the highest and won the bid in February, 2019.The plea was filed in the Supreme Court after the Kerala high court dismissed the state government's plea over the issue last year. It said that this a dispute between Centre and state and can be decided only by the Supreme Court under Article 131 of the Constitution.The Pinarayi Vijayan government contended that the Centre was bound to consult the state government under a 2003 assurance before involving a private party to run the airport. It said that the AAI's decision wasn’t in public interest as the private party has no experience in managing airports.It was also argued that the move violates the proprietary rights of the state government since the land on which the Thiruvananthapuram Airport is situated, was given by the state government and the erstwhile Travancore state to AAI from time to time free of cost.The Centre, meawhile, countered Kerala's arguments saying that the tender procedure was carried out in a transparent manner and special advantage was given to KSIDC considering the Kerala government's request. It also said that the decision to go for the PPP mode of operation, management and development of airports was taken purely on public interest. It was also a policy decision of the Union government.According to the Centre, the award of the lease to the KSIDC by allowing it to match the bid amount of the highest bidder after the completion of bidding process would have amounted to a violation of the entire bidding process.The Centre said that it had approved the grant of lease/concession of the airport to the highest bidder for 50 years subject to the security clearance from the national security agency. In fact, the decision taken by the Centre was in the interest of the airport.Adani enterprises argued that the property acquired and transferred to AAI completely vests with the Authority and therefore neither the state government nor KSIDC has any locus standi to lay any claim on the basis of the transfer of such property.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-to-hear-kerala-s-plea-against-centre-s-move-to-lease-thiruvananthapuram-airport-to-adani-enterprises-101615174309487.html

But the message was clear and the threat is real,” said a counterterror expert who asked not to be identified and who is now keeping an eye on the Iranian connection and the people associated with it.A low-intensity device exploded outside the Israel embassy on January 29. Counterterrorism agencies found that the explosive device used was not crude as it appeared to be. Instead, it was a remote-controlled device triggered off by a bomber using line of sight. While the results of the nature of the explosive are still awaited from forensic labs, the agencies feel the device was either an ammonium nitrate-fuel oil explosive with an electric detonator or a more sophisticated PETN (pentaerythritol tetranitrate) device. What they could confirm was that the device contained ammonium powder and had ball bearings, which shattered the windows of three cars parked nearby.Indian agencies recovered from the spot a letter addressed to Israel’s ambassador to India Ron Malka, calling him a terrorist and devil from a terrorist nation. The case is now being investigated by Indian agencies, with the involvement of experts from Israeli spy agency Mossad.Investigations into the contents of letter — the style of writing and exact spellings of those named — reveal that the missive was written by an Iranian, and possibly handed over by an agent under diplomatic cover, the people quoted above said. The letter swore revenge for Quds Force creator Qassem Soleimani and Abu Mehdhi Al Muhandis, both killed in a US drone attack in January 2020 in Baghdad, and Iranian nuclear physicist Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, who was targeted in a car bomb attack in November 2020.Both before and in the aftermath of the attack outside the Israel embassy, there were false cyber markers left in Afghanistan so that the main culprits behind the plot could be firewalled, a person aware of the matter said. The agencies said this also shows that the planning was done in great detail with possible reconnaissance runs of the diplomatic target, the person added.The Israeli ambassador to India has the highest level of protection, with proximate parameter security provided by Mossad agents.While Indian agencies have taken the attack very seriously, New Delhi is affronted that the Capital is being used by a friendly country to wage a proxy battle and the Modi government will take up the issue with Iran once the local supporters of the Iranian regime are taken into custody.HT reached out to the Iranian embassy for a comment but there was no response.After three agents of the Iranian Quds force targeted the wife of the Israeli Defence Attache in India with a magnetic bomb on February 13, 2012 (in Delhi) through an Indian conduit, the Manmohan Singh government not only threatened to expel diplomats but also downgrade the diplomatic relationship with Iran. The Quds Force agents managed to escape out of India at that time.The ramifications of Iranian involvement in the attack on Israel embassy this time will be very serious as the Modi government has gone out of the way to maintain ties with Tehran despite global pressure. Indian agencies said there will definitely be some action this time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/iran-guided-israeli-embassy-blast-through-local-module-upsets-india-officials-101615166916562.html

08-03-2021||India||Amit Shah attacks CM over gold smuggling case||Union home minister Amit Shah on Sunday hit back at Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan, saying he was making wild allegations in the gold smuggling case and that the state, once known for social revolution, was now “reduced to a land of corruption, political violence and bad governance”.Addressing the concluding session of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) state president K Surendran’s “Vijay Yatra” in the state capital, Shah posed five questions to the CM.He said that in light of recent developments, the CM had lost credibility and he is not fit to continue in power. The customs department filed an affidavit in the Kerala high court on Friday, citing the confessional statement of the main accused in the gold smuggling case, Swapna Suresh, that dollar was smuggled at the instance of the CM, three ministers and the speaker.“The CM recently said central agencies probing gold and dollar smuggling cases were targeting the state government. These are baseless charges. I just want to ask some questions — whether the main accused (Swapna Suresh) worked in a key position in the government or not; who appointed her in the post with hefty salary; whether she travelled with some leaders and officials abroad or not; whether she was a regular visitor to the CM’s office or not; and when gold was seized whether the CM office intervened or not,” Shah said.He said he had all details of both cases (gold and dollar smuggling) with him and asked the CM to answer his questions. He said if the CM was serious, he should cooperate with the ongoing investigation instead of making baseless charges. He also said the Centre viewed threats and attacks on officials of the agencies seriously.The gold smuggling case came to light last July after customs seized 30kg gold from a consignment that came in the name of an official of the UAE consulate in Thiruvananthapuram camouflaged as diplomatic consignment. Later, the case was handed over to the National Investigation Agency (NIA) and at least four other central agencies are part of the probe now.“Kerala was first to beat illiteracy and build tourism as an industry. But the alternate LDF and UDF governments have made it a land of corruption and violence. The UDF has solar scam and LDF gold smuggling scandal. They are competing how corrupt they can be,” Shah said.He also praised “Metro Man” E Sreedharan, who was present at the event. “A symbol of integrity and transparency, his entry will do good for the party and state. Even at this age, Metro Man is ready to serve the country. I salute him,” he said.Sreedharan said: “Often, many ask these days why I joined politics at this age. I told them that at this age too I have enough energy to work for Kerala and the country.”On Sunday, Shah also launched his party’s campaign for the April 6 Lok Sabha bypoll in Tamil Nadu and exuded confidence that the party would not only win there, but that the National Democratic Alliance in Tamil Nadu would emerge victorious in the assembly elections next month.“I am confident that a coalition government of AIADMK-BJP-PMK will be formed (after the assembly polls),” he said.The ruling AIADMK and the BJP in Tamil Nadu on Friday clinched a seat-sharing deal, with the former, the lead partner, allocating 20 Assembly seats for its saffron ally and the Kanyakumari Lok Sabha seat. BJP has nominated Radhakrishnan from there.With PTI inputs from Kanyakumari||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amit-shah-attacks-cm-over-gold-smuggling-case-101615154917613.html
08-03-2021||India||DMK finalises seat-sharing deal with seven allies in TN||Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) chief MK Stalin on Sunday finalised the contours of an alliance with seven partners, including the Congress, and announced sops for people in a 10-year vision plan if the coalition comes to power after the April 6 polls, saying the days of the ruling AIADMK were numbered.Addressing a state conference for its cadres on the outskirts of Trichy, Stalin said a DMK government will give ₹1,000 every month to housewives and create a million jobs every month.“We aim to lift 10 million people out of poverty,” Stalin said after announcing that the DMK will fight 170 of the 234 assembly seats with an aim to get a simple majority on its own. Stalin agreed to allot 25 assembly seats and the Kanyakumari Lok Sabha seat to main ally Congress. The Kanyakumari seat fell vacant after the death of Congress MP H Vasanthakumar last year.Stalin said he aspired to bring Tamil Nadu among the top three agricultural states in terms of cash crops. He promised two million concrete houses, piped drinking water supply and broadband connectivity for all households in villages.Asked if his party was satisfied with the number of seats allotted by its ally, Congress in-charge for Tamil Nadu Dinesh Gundu Rao said the only aim was to ensure the victory of the secular front led by the DMK. The Congress had initially asked for 40 seats and the number is one of the lowest the party is contesting in the southern state for nearly two decades.With this, the DMK has allotted 48 seats from its share to parties in the coalition (CPI, MDMK, VCK, IUML, MMK) with talks pending with the CPI(M) and a few smaller parties. Talks between the DMK and the Congress hit a roadblock as the national party wanted at least 30 seats, having initially sought 40, with the DMK unwilling to budge.“This election isn’t just for a change of government but for the DMK to remain in power continuously in Tamil Nadu,” Stalin said while revealing his vision which he said was prepared in consultation with economists, educationists and experts.The high-voltage conference mobilised more than a 100,000 cadres who gathered on the outskirts of Trichy near the Samayapuram toll gate at a 350-acre venue covered in red carpet. Stalin entered with fireworks as a team of DJs blared his campaign song as he went on a one-kilometre ramp walk waving to the crowd.Trichy being a stronghold of the DMK is represented by MLA and party principal secretary KN Nehru and has had several such conferences in the past. “But this is the biggest I’ve seen in my lifetime,” said veteran leader Durai Murugan.“It’s good that they’re focussing on issues like education, rural development, water supply. The highlight in his vision is the ₹1000 scheme for housewives. But we don’t know how feasible it is for around 2.8 crore ration cards in the state...,” said political commentator Sumanth Raman||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dmk-finalises-seat-sharing-deal-with-seven-allies-in-tn-101615154674685.html
08-03-2021||India||After Jammu G23 meet, Tewari hits campaign||Congress leader Manish Tewari addressed a public meeting in poll-bound Kerala’s Malappuram on Saturday.Tweeting about the meeting Sunday, he said, “Last night addressed a public meeting of @iumlofficial on conclusion of Sauhrtha Sandesh Yatra at Perinthalmanna at Malappuram District Kerala led by Sayyid Sadikali Shihab Thangal. Electrifying Energy among people.’’Tewari, one of the 23 leaders who wrote a letter to Congress president Sonia Gandhi seeking internal reform in the party, addressed the Kerala meeting at the invitation of the Congress’s ally, Indian Union Muslim League.In another tweet, Tewari said, “From Saffron ‘SAFA’ (TURBAN) of Dogra Rajputs of Jammu & Kashmir to the Green of the @iumlofficial deep in the Northern part of Kerala these are the vibrant colours that make up our National Flag. This is the diversity of our great land. The idea of India we fight for. Jai Hind.”The meeting came a week after Tewari and other letter writers, the group has been tagged the G23, addressed a meeting in Jammu in honour of retired MP Ghulam Nabi Azad.After the meeting, Congress leader Abhishek Manu Singhvi said that the leaders should shift focus to poll-bound states. “The best contribution to the Congress cause would be to get active in the various abhiyans which are going on in the various states that are going to elections. It is important to campaign in the five states and I would like to remind all of that.”Last August, the 23 leaders wrote a letter to Gandhi, calling for “full-time and effective leadership” and elections to the Congress Working Committee.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-jammu-g23-meet-tewari-hits-campaign-101615153582495.html
08-03-2021||India||Over 300 people try to gauge mood for Cong in TN, Kerala||About 210 people in Kerala and 120 in Tamil Nadu – none of them Congress workers – are travelling around the two states, talking to people at roadside tea stalls, salons, places of worship and bus stands to assess the best picks for the Congress’s candidates for the upcoming assembly polls, according to people aware of the developments.In Tamil Nadu, the Congress is in alliance with the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagham (DMK). In Puducherry, where the party lost power weeks ago, 70 people have hit the ground with the same goal.The public survey is being conducted by independent “foot-soldiers” who are not party workers. They go door to door and meet people at various places; the internal opinion poll is logged through mobile phones. The Congress’s Shakti App has contact details of more than 5 million Congress workers in India. The party devised the digital supporter network ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.“We are preparing two different types of ground report. The first one is done by consulting the party workers and the second one is feedback from common people. While the internal survey is done right from the bloc level, our interaction with the common people happens everywhere...,” said Praveen Chakravarti, chairman of the Congress’s data analytics department.This is the first time the Congress, with an ear to the ground, is asking the common people about their preferred Congress candidates for the polls, widening the scope of public consultation. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi earlier started in-house opinion polls or internal surveys to find out which candidate enjoys the support of grassroots-level workers.For a party that aimed to be a champion of the “aam aadmi” and which accused the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government of favouring a handful of industrialists, the wider engagement with common people also coincides with the internal challenges propelled by a section of the senior leaders questioning the organisation’s style of functioning.These surveys are being conducted by the party’s data analytics department in Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Puducherry only — in other words, in those areas where the stakes are very high for the Congress. In poll-bound states of Assam and West Bengal, no such activities at the central level are being conducted, but party leaders said that the local leadership may be taking feedback in their own ways for candidates.Chakravati feels that these exercises also help the party to reach out to people. “On many occasions, party workers tell us that after spending so many years in the Congress, finally the party is asking our opinion as to who should be our candidate,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/over-300-people-try-to-gauge-mood-for-cong-in-tn-kerala-101615153282899.html
08-03-2021||India||6 states continue to record spike in Covid cases: Centre||At least six states are seeing a strong resurgence of new infections of Covid-19 in recent weeks, the central government said on Sunday, as it deputed high-level teams comprising public health experts to two states of particular concern – Maharashtra and Punjab – to assist local governments in surveillance, control and containment measures.Government experts pointed out that a reduction in testing, with a “particularly low share of gold-standard RT-PCR tests”, inadequate contact-tracing of positive cases, and uncontrolled gatherings during the wedding season were some of the reasons behind the spike in cases.The observations from the Union health ministry come a day after the country reported the largest single-day increase in new Covid-19 infections in two months. This abrupt resurgence in cases has brought forth fears of the start of a nationwide second wave of Covid-19 at a time when a new phase of vaccination, which covers the most vulnerable sections of the general public, started a week ago and is only beginning to pick up pace.Maharashtra, Kerala, Punjab, Karnataka, Gujarat and Tamil Nadu were identified by the Centre as the six regions that have seen a rise in new cases in the recent weeks. These six collectively accounted for 84.7% of the 18,711 new daily cases reported on Saturday — the highest single-day increase in cases since January 6.India’s worst-hit state, Maharashtra, with 2.2 million infections and more than 52,000 deaths, is again reporting the most new infections in the country — the state reported 11,141 new cases on Sunday. It is followed by Kerala, the second worst-hit region with 1.07 million cases, which reported 2,100 new infections and Punjab, which reported 1,051 new cases on Sunday.A total of 18,643 cases were reported across the country on Sunday, according to HT’s Covid-19 dashboard. The seven-day average of new cases (also known as the Covid curve) currently is at 16,744, the highest in nearly two months, a statistic that has alarmed experts.The Centre, meanwhile, deputed high-level teams comprising at least three public health experts to two states – Maharashtra and Punjab – in order to assist local governments in surveillance, control and containment measures.“The idea behind sending expert teams is to get to the root of why the cases have suddenly seen a surge, and accordingly suggest appropriate measures to control it. So far, it looks like the increase in cases could be due to large gatherings where Covid-19-appropriate behaviour is not observed, especially with the wedding season and a fall in Covid-19 testing,” said a senior government official familiar with the developments, asking not to be named.Two other regions that are showing an upward trend of new infections, according to the Centre, are Delhi and Haryana. At a high-level meeting held with representatives of eight states and Union Territories on Saturday, the Centre expressed concern regarding nine districts in Delhi, 15 in Haryana, 10 in Andhra Pradesh, 10 in Odisha, nine in Himachal Pradesh, seven in Uttarakhand, two in Goa, and one in Chandigarh.Government experts had observed that increase in weekly positivity in these districts appeared largely due to reduced overall testing, with a “particularly low share of real-time reverse polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test”, and inadequate contact tracing of positive cases. They have been directed to increase the share of RT-PCR testing, demarcate containment areas, carry out close contact-tracing of minimum of 20 people per positive case, appropriate clinical management of patients, and be particularly vigilant about any superspreader events.Experts say increasing Covid-19 vaccination in these high load areas holds the key in breaking the chain of transmission. “This will prevent any sort of second wave. Also, covering the entire vulnerable population fast will take us ahead of the virus,” said Dr Giridhara R Babu, professor and head, life-course epidemiology, Indian Institute of Public Health.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/6-states-continue-to-record-spike-in-covid-cases-centre-101615146557704.html
08-03-2021||India||‘Women are not pleading, they are leading’: Smriti Irani||On the eve of the International Women’s Day, union minister for women and child development Smriti Irani spoke to Vinod Sharma on the challenges and opportunities the women have in the country, her role as a minister and the BJP’s battle axe against the Congress. Edited excerpts:We’re talking on the eve of the International Women’s Day. What’s your objective take on the status of women in our society?We’re at a point in our history where we’ve recognised that women not only have to be empowered but they, as citizens, must lead the change. For too long the empowerment narrative gave the impression that we were the weaker lot who needed additional support. More and more women now know that all they required was equal opportunity to compete, equal access to resources and an acknowledgement of their achievement. When the Prime Minister speaks of women-led development, it’s a tectonic shift in narrative terms. Women are not pleading, they’re leading.Public outreach has to be there to sensitise the other gender. We’ve seen many incidents (of violence against women).We’ve had an equal number of men who stood up for (gender) equality, who recognised the need to correct past wrongs. To paint all Indian men with one brush will be a disservice not only to the male gender but also to the female. Yes, there have been men who objectified women, who dissuaded them from reaching their full potential, who consistently broke the law, who ensured that women were kept away from resources and denied credit and respect. That said, there also have been men who stood shoulder to shoulder with their daughters, their wives.Why haven’t the stringent penal provisions against rape and other forms of violence been a good enough deterrent?Deterrence comes from firm application of the law; by ensuring that investigation is prompt. It comes with access to evidence-based justice, not justice which dis-balances (sic) the scale just because a decision has to be given in favour of a woman. Under the Nirbhaya fund, we’ve pronounced establishment of over 1,000 fast-track courts... For the first time, we took steps to ensure an anti-human trafficking unit in each district. The PM was insistent on having a one-stop crisis centre in every district. West Bengal made the exception of not coming on board. But we have 700 functional one-stop crisis centres that provide under one roof medico-legal and police help to women victims.Laws come into play after the incidents. Isn’t prevention the key?The national education policy which came to fruition after three decades has for the first time, a gender-inclusion fund. It fiscally empowers the states by ensuring that there’s money behind including gender not only up to grade VIII of education but also in enhancing the gender component in higher education. When we speak of societal change, we have to focus on empowerment through STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics). When I began the conversation six years ago, about women in science, particularly STEM, the first steps I took (as education minister), with the PM’s blessings, was to get a woman to lead the IIT council.That underscores the need for the promised (33%) quota for women in Parliament and state assemblies. Your party has now the legislative strength to make it happen.I was in the Rajya Sabha when it passed the women’s reservation bill (in 2008). The UPA (then in power) was in disarray. There was absolutely no support the Congress party had on it. Our leadership said they’d support the bill’s passage – and we did. Apart from the fact that the BJP is steadfast in its commitment for passing the bill, what fascinates me – when I speak of pedigreed women – that there’s that nuance and bias even in politics. We have 1.3 million women in our panchayats. It seems we never consider them politically potent enough to be mentioned.You didn’t comment on the likelihood of women’s reservation bill being passed.Has the BJP under the leadership of Narendra Modi ever shied away from its pronouncements in the manifesto? Aren’t Article 370 and Ram Janmabhoomi evidence enough? My party is resolute in its support of the bill.Yours has been a long journey to politics from issue-based television and the entertainment industry. Has that helped?I’m the only female politician who’s also recognised by her former vocation. I recognise the bias in that. When you say, oh, she used to be an actor you indicate that she possibly isn’t very serious on issues of policy and administration.It becomes that inflection point that helps to dismiss her capacities, her potential... It becomes interesting when you look at the fact that as education minister, I made the first ever national ranking framework. Is there any recognition accorded to me for it? I conducted the largest-ever consultation on education policy in our democracy. Would I get any kind of acceptance for that? On the PM’s direction, I created a network that had some of the best academicians from the world over, coming to India and teaching in government institutions. Under the PM’s leadership, we started a project called Imprint that brought together all research bodies...There’s a story recounted in a book on the Amethi election you won. It says you turned away a local politician who used low-brow language for Priyanka Gandhi Vadra at a meeting with you. When does the woman in you take over from the politician?The presumption is wrong if you think they’re in any way separate. I’ve never been afforded the same courtesy, be it Ms Vadra or her immediate friends circle or Mr (Rahul) Gandhi (and) his political positioning and support to men who sexually objectified me, mocked me or made explicit comments about me. I’ve not been afforded that compliment, that particular respect by the (Gandhi) siblings. That’s what makes me different from them.So, the incident happened…I will not comment because I’ve not read the book… I don’t understand why my politics has to be tugged to a star that’s drowning. My politics is much beyond the rambling siblings. I’ve spent a few years as an Opposition member as well. On the Pocso legislation, I spoke on behalf of the entire Opposition in the Rajya Sabha. In 2013, I was a prominent speaker on the sexual harassment at workplace bill… When Meira Kumar was Speaker, I represented the Asia-Pacific region on the Syrian crisis in the International Parliamentary Union.I’m saying this today because if a woman does not come from a pedigreed position, she’d be denied recognition. There wasn’t a murmur when the world economic forum announced me as a young global leader in 2015. If some twiddling siblings were recognised with even a normal domestic award, there would’ve been much hoopla about it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/women-are-not-pleading-they-are-leading-smriti-irani-101615144328862.html
08-03-2021||India||2nd half of Budget session may be cut short due to state polls||The month-long second half of Parliament’s Budget Session is likely to be shortened by two weeks, with government managers and some Opposition leaders requesting Rajya Sabha chairman Venkaiah Naidu and Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla to curtail the proceedings in view of upcoming assembly elections, people aware of the matter said on Sunday, a day ahead of the resumption of the House.While the first part of the Budget Session began on January 29 and concluded two days before schedule on February 13, the second leg is officially set to end on April 8. The session is set to coincide with the March-April elections in West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Assam, Kerala and Puducherry.A Parliament official said that government managers as well as many opposition leaders have requested the Rajya Sabha chairman and Lok Sabha Speaker to cut short the session as leaders of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Congress, Trinamool Congress, Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), Left bloc, Asom Gana Parishad (AGP), All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) and many regional outfits would be busy in election campaigning.Another senior official said on condition of anonymity that the second half of the session, which starts on Monday, may run for just two weeks. “The elections are starting from March 27. Keeping the political considerations in mind, it looks like the session is likely to run for two weeks only,” the official added.The remaining part of the Budget Session may also see the resumption of normal parliamentary schedule of simultaneous proceedings for both Houses from 11am, the official added. Currently, the two Houses sit in different shifts to ensure social distancing norms amid the Covid-19 pandemic.An official said that both Houses could meet at 11 am from the second week following the vaccination of eligible MPs. “Since many MPs would be busy in campaign, we are not expecting a full house in this session,” the Rajya Sabha official said, asking not to be named.A third official said: “Therefore, the current system of allotment of seats covering both Houses will be scrapped and MPs of one House can be accommodated in their own House. This will allow simultaneous running of both Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha.”The government’s top priority would be to get various demands for grants for the year 2021-22 passed along with the Finance Bill. It also has about 25 bills shortlisted for passage but those could be taken up later, too. Some of the bills listed by the government include the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (Amendment) Bill, National Bank for Financing Infrastructure and Development Bill, Electricity (Amendment) Bill, Crypto currency and Regulation of Official Digital Currency Bill.While some Opposition leaders have supported the idea of curtailing the Budget Session, the it has divided those within the Congress party. At Sunday’s meeting of the party’s strategy group, which is headed by Congress president Sonia Gandhi, the party’s leader in the Lok Sabha Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury supported the idea, saying that only Punjab MPs will be present for most of the session. He said he would be busy with the West Bengal elections, deputy leader Gaurav Gogoi will be in Assam for campaigning and groups of MPs from Kerala and Tamil Nadu will be in their respective regions, according to a person aware of the developments. He also pointed out that opposition parties such as the Trinamool Congress and DMK are also likely to be absent from Parliament, the person added.However, the Congress’s Rajya Sabha leaders Jairam Ramesh and Anand Sharma said that the move to curtail the session would set a dangerous precedent. According to two leaders who attended the meeting but didn’t want to be named, the Rajya Sabha leaders felt that it undermined the Congress party’s position of asking for Parliament to run. When former Prime Minister and RS member Manmohan Singh agreed with them, Sonia Gandhi said that the Congress party will not ask for the session to be cut short, the leaders said.“We will ask the government to make their position clear on the session and if other parties also agree, then we will accept,” said one of the leaders quoted above. “The Congress party will not ask for the session to be cut short.” The final word on the issue will become clear at the business advisory committee meeting. While Ramesh refused to comment, Chowdhury and Sharma did not respond.The Congress has also decided to aggressively raise the issue of fuel price hikes in Parliament.“I am bringing an adjournment motion on the issue,” said Kerala MP K Suresh.“In the coming days, the party will speak up for the problems that this issue is creating for the common man,” he added. Suresh said that the other issues that are going to be raised by the Congress include the now 100-day-long agitation by farmers against three agri laws and a demand for better law-and-order for women and children. The House proceedings were washed out for four consecutive days in the first half of the session over the Opposition’s demand for a separate discussion on farm issues. To make up for the lost time, the House sat till midnight on several days.“There is no reason why the parliamentary calendar should be impacted by state elections...A truncated session will either result in less time for debate on national and legislative issues, or such debates being pushed to the monsoon session...” Chakshu Roy, Head of Legislative and Civic Engagement, PRS Legislative Research.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2nd-half-of-budget-session-may-be-cut-short-due-to-state-polls-101615143953565.html

08-03-2021||India||Govt plan to take over mine auctions faces opposition from a few states||The Union mines ministry has proposed amendments to the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957, allowing captive mine owners to sell up to 50% of the approved capacity in the open market and giving itself the power to auction mines that the states have failed to auction.The changes have been opposed by some states who see it as another attempt by the Centre to take over mining auctions and impose central rules on a state domain. Except coal, states are allowed to auction other mines in consultation with the central ministry. Parliament in September 2020 approved an Ordinance promulgated in June to improve revenue from the mining sector and the Centre now wants states to carry out these changes too.In a note to amend the law, circulated to all states, the mines ministry said the amendments have been proposed after consultation with Union ministries and states to improve revenue from the mining sector and to reduce dependence on imports.The ministry has proposed to allow sale of 50% of minerals from captive mines in open market after meeting the need of plants they are attached to.Under the captive mines scheme, the mineral can be mined only for the plant to which it is attached and no royalty is charged for the same.With the change in law, the government aims at increasing production, especially from the captive coal mines. There are 194 captive coal blocks in India that were auctioned between 1993 and 2011, and which have coal reserves of 44 billion tonnes.“This (market sale) will help to increase coal production from captive mines, coal availability in the market leading to reduction in import. This will also ensure additional revenue to the states and lead to Atmanirbhar Bharat,” the proposal said.To improve revenue, the ministry has fixed up to 2.5 times of the existing royalty for allowing commercial sales from the captive mines. A decision on how much mineral from each captive mine can be sold will be taken by the mines and coal ministries, the note says.Licence holders currently pay a royalty of ₹50 to ₹250 for a tonne of coal depending on its quality and ₹800 per tonne of asbestos. For several other minerals, the royalty is charged on ad valorem (percentage of the sale price) basis as per the rates published by Indian Bureau of Mines. The ad valorem royalty ranges from 0.4% per tonne for bauxite to 12% for copper. A mines ministry official said that streamlining of the auctions would help in better utilisation of mines and ensuring flow of minerals for industries. “There are many indirect benefits as it improves tax collections for the Centre and states and also create additional job avenues,” he said.The ministry justified changes in the auction rules saying it would “ensure continuous supply of minerals in the country.” Any delay in auction will have substantial impact on the availability as well as prices of minerals, the note said.Another amendment proposed is to empower the Centre to auction mines that states have failed to auction. Of the 143 such mines listed for auctioning, states have auctioned only 7 since 2015, the proposal said. According to ministry officials, states were getting about ₹10,000 crore as revenue from these mines. “Further, mining lease in relation to 334 blocks expired on 31 March 2020, out of which 46 are working mines. Ministry of Mines is pursuing with the state governments since early 2019 for early auction of these blocks ensuring continuity in production of minerals. Only 28 blocks have been auctioned till date,” added the ministry.However, some states have opposed the proposal.Chhattisgarh mines secretary, P Anbalgan, said there are various reasons including the feasibility of a mine and the net mineable reserves as against the estimated resources in a mine and market conditions apart from the time needed for technical preparations for delay in mine auctions. “Like Centre, every state is interested in auction of mines but limitations are there for both... In cooperative federalism, states should be allowed to exercise their right to bring their mines to auction after considering all parameters,” he said.Shankar Sinha, Jharkhand’s Director, Mines, said, “The state government was finalising its own policy on the issues listed in the mines ministry proposal. Once done, we would send our suggestions to the Centre....”Odisha mines minister Prafulla Mallik said they have reservation on certain provisions of the proposed changes. “We have questions regarding why the Centre wants to take over auctions and have sought clarifications,” he said, while supporting the proposal to hike rates for sale of minerals from captive mines.The Goa Mining People’s Front, a collective of mine worker unions in the state, has also opposed the proposal.(With inputs from Vishal Kant in Raipur, Debabrata Mohanty in Bhubaneswar & Ritesh Mishra in Raipur)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-plan-to-take-over-mine-auctions-faces-opposition-from-a-few-states-101615142917023.html
08-03-2021||India||India must strive to catch the ecological bus||India has been ablaze with devastating forest fires in Uttarakhand and in Orissa’s Similipal. Why aren’t these being discussed with the same intensity as the Tapovan catastrophe in February? Several scientists have been reported saying that the dramatic fall in rainfall this season has a directly co-relation with these fires in Uttarakhand. This may be a fact, but the absence of rainfall is caused by climate crisis. India has to gear up to protect its spectacular biodiversity from the many cataclysmic events that are bound to attack our country as climate change intensifies.A re-invigorated biodiversity management policy is India’s survival strategy. At this point in our development trajectory, we don’t pay any heed to either biodiversity or landscape conservation. We can only grow if we avert an ecological and environmental collapse. We cannot afford expenditure on disaster relief and rehabilitation, instead of innovation, education and health. Let’s go back to the drawing board for every single project, with new focus on biodiversity. India must rapidly build and nurture grassroots-based habitat monitoring and governance. Incentives can make or break this. Well known conservationist, Bishwajit Mohanty from Orissa, points out in Down to Earth magazine, how local women can be involved in sweeping forest floors in specific seasons to prevent fires and Van Panchayats can be incentivised to catch poachers. Locals, not politicians, must co-own the forest more than they do, along with the forest department. The bus for a stable, sustainable future is moving on. Let’s race and catch it.The writer is the founder and director of Chintan Environmental Research and Action Group||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-must-strive-to-catch-the-ecological-bus-101615142599020.html
08-03-2021||India||Early summer, lack of rain spark fires||Forest fires are raging in many parts of the country as the mercury spikes and there is a large rain deficiency except in parts of peninsular India, leading to an earlier than usual onset of the fire season, senior officials of the Forest Survey of India said on Saturday.According to Forest Survey of India’s forest fire alert system, there were 2,317 fire points last year between February 26 and March 7, but the figure rose to 53,211 this time after data from the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (SNPP) was taken into account.When data from the MODIS satellite is considered, there were 627 fire points last year during the same period while there are 6295 fire points this year. In the past seven days, Odisha alone recorded nearly 18,000 fire points as per SNPP followed by around 5000 fires in Telangana; around 4,500 fires in Jharkhand and 4300 in Madhya Pradesh.“We depend on two satellites for fire data. SNPP collects forest fires at 375 metres resolution so even small fires are picked up. There could be many factors contributing to increased forest fires — one of them is fuel load. Whether forests have been cleared of dry twigs, branches, etc will have to be seen. Other important factors are soil moisture and heat, which help fires ignite quickly. In 2013, we did an assessment of the worst fire periods. It’s normally May which is also the hottest month in many states. But this year we may see a spike in April, also depending on temperatures,” said Sunil Chandra, deputy director, forest geoinformatics division.“The reasons for forest fires can be different in different states. Local factors are also important. This year and last year there has been a very high number of forest fires in Uttarakhand, also starting in October and November and resuming again from February. Not only fuel load, the topography in Uttarakhand also makes it prone to spread of fires,” added Chandra. The FSI’s data shows forest fires started spiking from January this year peaking dramatically in March.According to a statement by India Meteorological Department on Friday, maximum temperatures are between 37 to 39 degree C over most places in West, Central, East and Southern Peninsula. The highest maximum temperature of 40.4 degree C was recorded at Bhubaneshwar in Odisha on Saturday. On Friday the highest maximum temperature was recorded at Bhuj-Rudramata (Saurashtra & Kutch) at 40 degrees C. The highest maximum temperatures were recorded at Brahmapuri (Vidarbha) at 39.8 degrees C, followed by Kothagudem (Telangana) at 39.5 degrees C and Chandrapur (Vidarbha) at 39.2 degrees C on Thursday.The IMD’s climate summary for February showed rainfall over the country as a whole for the month was 7.6mm, 68% less than its Long Period Average (LPA) of 23.5mm making it the sixth lowest since 1901. In February, Odisha recorded 83% rain deficiency, Uttarakhand 71%, West Madhya Pradesh 68%, and Telangana 74%, among others. There was 72% rain deficiency in the country between March 1 and 6.“Generally, when there is a dry period for a long time and temperatures are high, forest fires increase. They can, however, be triggered by human activity also. We are expecting some rain in the extreme northern parts of the country in the next few days and in some parts down south due to easterly activity. There is also a possibility of rain in the north-eastern states as we enter the pre-monsoon season. But I don’t see a possibility of rain in Odisha or other central parts unless a low-pressure area or other weather systems develop,” said DS Pai, climate scientist at IMD Pune.Indian summer or what the India Meteorological Department calls “pre-monsoon season” in March-April-May has seen a very clear shift in its intensity since 1998. Long-term data from 1971 onwards suggests a shift to considerably warmer than normal summers since 1998 and more than doubling of deadly heatwave events as per the IMD’s assessment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/early-summer-lack-of-rain-spark-fires-101615142233553.html
